204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Delivers Again,"My 2nd stay @ The Fitzwilliam.  The hotel is very well situated on St. Stephens Green.  I'm a light sleeper, but had no issues with either internal noise, or exterior noise from pedestrians or vehicles, despite our great room location overlooking the Green.  Staff was very responsive, warm, welcoming & helpful.  Their cooked to order breakfast plus extensive buffet was as good as I remembered from my 2018 stay.

Room category’s were not what was booked.  We made it very clear in an email to Hotel our concerns regarding the rooms.  

Front Desk Staff & Manager made an earnest effort to correct room category for last night, unfortunately we were settled, site seeing  and preparing for early departure next day.  Repacking and organizing was not an option in middle of the afternoon.  

Front Desk  sent  bottles of  Prosecco  to our rooms. Management reached out in email and we expressed we’d prefer our room charges to be lowered to the actual room category we were given. 

Manager offered a 10% reduction in our bill for two rooms which was off by 10% for the lower room category.

Front desk, concierge team, were all wonderful.
Breakfast was one of the finest on our trip and the staff were friendly and professional and were able to accommodate all of our dietary needs.

204,A must for a 5* stay in Dublin ,What a fantastic hotel. From the minute we walked in the lobby we had amazing service and brilliant staff and at the top of their game.

204,One of the best in Dublin,"Spent 4 nights at the Fitzwilliam Dublin. The location is superb for a newcomer to Dublin, rooms are very comfortable and well attended, and the staff is outstanding.

204,One Night stay prior to Departure Back to US,"Nice place to stay for a night.  Staff was excellent.  Recommend eating breakfast there prior to departure.  Taxi ride to Airport took about 45 Minutes with no traffic.  FYI,  area around the the hotel was walkable with nice restaurants and pubs.  Warning, walking to ""Temple Bar"" area from hotel not recommended, you have to go through some areas that we didn't feel safe in after 7 PM",5,2024,07,20
204,Not a complete 5 star expirence,"Staff were friendly, when we first entered the room we noticed the decor. It was beautiful. After a long day of walking I got back and wanted a bath unfortunately the plug on the bath was broke and had been previously taped with black tape. For a 5 star hotel I would expect the facilities to be fit for purpose and especially having paid £250 for one night and breakfast not included in that price. Bed wasn't the most comfortable. However location was spot on, the luas is directly across from the hotel and you are literally a few steps away from Grafton street. Be careful with the parking you need to arrange it with the hotel to receive the discount or could be faced with a hefty 98 euro fee. Hotel reception did rectify this for us.",3,2024,07,18
204,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed on a Saturday night for a special birthday , the staff went above and beyond to make the stay special",5,2024,07,16

204,Exceptional Service and a Convenient Location,Exceptional Service and Convenient Location. The Fitzwilliam has been renovated to a very high standard with ongoing upgrades to Bar and Breakfast area. The service is incredible with on site parking. Glovers Alley is a great venue for business meetings along with other quiet areas to meet. Highly recommended,5,2024,07,15
204,Really nice experience. We'll be back,"We stay in a hotel in Dublin 3 or 4 times a year when we can (even though we live in Dublin). We tend to try for one of the 5 star ones especially if there is a deal to be had.
I think the Fitzwilliam is outdoing the Shelburne based on this stay. Haven't stayed at the Westbury for years because we really didn't enjoy the last time we did and it was just way to expensive for the service received.
Staff at the front desk were excellent especially.
The room was the nicest by a long margin. 
Breakfast is a buffet for the cold items and all hot food is prepared fresh and brought to the table and if you want more you can just ask. This is a nicer experience than the full hot buffet and the quality is always going to be better this way.

The only things I would mention that could be improved are.
1. The bar is not really a nice place to sit. It's a bit canteen like. We opted to sit in reception for a last drink but sitting in the window people watching was really enjoyable. It's a lively corner of the city.
2. The corridors have a bit of a clinical smell. It obviously shows how clean they are kept but something with a more perfumed odor would be a better option if available. 

The value for money compared to others is really what makes this hotel stand out though. Substantially cheaper than the other 5 star hotels but with service that outdoes them.",5,2024,07,15
204,Luxury hotel in perfect Dublin location,"Everything about the Fitzwilliam Hotel was perfect. Location is walking distance to all the main sites, St Stephens Green park, and numerous restaurants.

204,Dublin gem great for families,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin for 2 nights in July with our toddler. I cannot say enough good things about our stay. The staff were so helpful and kind from the moment we arrived. The rooms are in great condition and have beautiful furnishings. The breakfast was reasonably priced and delicious. The travel crib we requested was in the room when we arrived and was very clean and in great condition. The best thing was the proximity to everything, especially the park (St. Stephen’s Green). We will definitely be staying here again in the future. ",5,2024,07,10

204,BEWARE,"Beautiful hotel, great staff, poor location. The Dublin Fitzwilliam hotel is located next-door to a nightclub. Extremely loud music on Friday night until 2:15am. If you’re looking to sleep, don’t go on the weekends. We were extremely disappointed because the hotel itself is beautiful.",3,2024,06,27
204,Enjoyable experience,"I enjoyed my one day stay at the hotel. Staff were extremely helpful and attentive. I didn't have to wait in line at all, everybody was polite. Concierge service was quick and very helpful.

204,Over night stay,Was ok over priced for the quality in my opinion.  The staff are amazing really friendly and helpful if it wasn’t for them rating would be lower,3,2024,06,12
204,Not a true 5 stat,The hotel needs to.work.on training the staff to service the guests.  There is a feeling of amateurness about the service that doesn't feel like a 5 star property. Excellent location though and decent rooms with very confusing light switches.,3,2024,06,10
204,"Quality, service, and comfort","Comfortable and well-appointed rooms, impeccable service, great breakfast. St. Stephens Green is across the street, but there is a lot of pedestrian traffic in the area due to proximity to Grafton Street, an indoor shopping mall, and public toilets. Location does provide easy walking access to many museums, galleries, pubs, restaurants, and historic sites.",5,2024,06,04

The service and standards at the Fitzwilliam are second to none. The sumptuous decor is warm and inviting, the staff all welcoming and well trained, and the delicious breakfast will set you up for the day! Thank you <3",5,2024,05,28

204,Best hotel in Dublin!,"The Fitzwilliam is a delight.  We stayed six nights in May, and had to tear ourselves away.  Beyond the absolute loveliness of the hotel and its perfect location on St. Stephen's Green, is the above-excellent staff who go above and beyond to be welcoming and helpful.  We enjoyed a daily breakfast buffet that I am still raving about, the in-hotel restaurant for drinks and dinner, and convenient and tasty room service.  It's close to the green, Iveagh Garden, the college, great pubs and restaurants, and shopping, with easy transportation to everywhere right outside the front door.  Highly, highly recommend.",5,2024,05,25
204,the perfect hotel for very tiny deaf people.,"a very mixed bag this place.we asked for a big bed and a big shower,we got possibly the smallest hotel room in dublin,with a bathroom slightly smaller than a phone box.the loo so tight the loo roll holder was in the way to sit down.
a very nice woman on reception saved the day and found us a decent room and bathroom.
in fairness,the staff are the only good thing about the place.
so far,so good,until night three when the banging music from the next door bar made sleeping impossible into the early hours,despite repeated requests to the front desk to do the necessary.
not my idea of good news.
strangest thing of all,the hotel took full payment on arrival,including some extra which i was informed was to cover them for any damage done by us to the room.
i don’t know what kind of people stay in this place,but in over fifty years of staying in hotels of all kinds,that was a first for me.
so,in conclusion,if this place is a five star hotel,i will eat my hat.
i wouldn’t stay there again and would strongly suggest that you don’t either.",2,2024,05,25

There is a tram stop right in front making access to transit super easy. The hotel has a concierge with baggage check, bar, and restaurant and ourv stay included breakfast which was DELICIOUS. The staff is very helpful and assisted with our bags on arrival and departure and even posted some postcards to loved ones for me. We stayed here on a birthday trip and were greeted in the room by a plate of fruit, cheese, and chocolates with a HBD card from the owner/manager. 

The rooms are spacious and very clean, the showers had good water pressure and the towels were ample. Turndown service includes chocolates but I never did figure out how to get all the bathroom lights on at the same time. If you can splurge for a room overlooking the park with a balcony, I sat on ours for hours sipping a prosecco and people watching.",5,2024,05,14

204,Gorgeous hotel off of St Stephens Green,"Elegant and charming and warm and inviting. My room at The Fitzwilliam was beautifully decorated with a door opening to a small balcony overlooking St Stephens Green.  The afternoon was warm with a small balcony to prootect from weather (although no rain!) and I enjoyed the complementary tea while people watching for a bit.  Robes, Slippers, complementary drinks in the fridge, beautiful bath made this a great stay.  The concierge handed me a copy of the restaurants in the area after making me a reservation. I enjoyed a glass of wine by the fireplace in the main area lobby prior to turning in to find turn down service that left some chocolates near my pillow.  (they did not make it past the night..:))

While a splurge for me - with the balcony - the other rooms that open to the ""garden"" have a beautiful space in the center courtyard. Michelin Star restaurant on site, beautiful bar off the lobby, and steps away from shopping, live music in bars and street, and super restaurants.  and lots of transportation if you need to get to other spots.

204,Lovely stay despite miscommunication,"Had a disappointment stay at this hotel. Staff seemed to unknown what was going on. I was told a holding amount would come off my card and the amount taken was double what I was taken and it became clear that staff were inadequately trained to use the computer systems. 
Despite the confusion, the room was lovely and modern with a view of the park a huge bed and beautiful bathroom. 
The hotel itself is situated on the edges of the town and is about 15 minutes walk to the river, which was quite handy for exploring the city. 
If your looking for a luxury break, it is a lovely place to stay.",3,2024,04,28
204,AMAZING Stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin,"This is a phenomenal hotel in an excellent location across from St. Stephens Green.  It is steps from Grafton Street, an 8 minute walk to Trinity College and a 15 minute walk to Temple Bar District.  It is very centrally located.  The room is updated and all of the features/amenities are top notch.  One of few hotels in Ireland I stayed in that matched its 5 star rating.  The service is stellar.  Everyone including the bellmen, reception, concierge, wait staff at breakfast to room service were friendly, informative, helpful and overall - fabulous!  I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2024,04,26
204,Great hotel and convenient location,"The fitzwilliam hotel is conveniently located on Stephen's green next to Grafton St.  Plenty of restaurants around and we found Dublin to be a very walkable city.  The bed was very comfortable and we slept well, even with jetlag.  Staff was friendly and professional.  ",5,2024,04,25
204,Great location and fantastic service,"This is a beautiful hotel overlooking St Stephens green in Dublin, it was beautiful, modern, clean and the staff were amazing to deal with.  The food was lovely and i would definitely recommend.",5,2024,04,25

204,My stay,"I love staying iat your hotel when I come to Dublin
It’s very convenient for me as my Car is parked. Everything is walking distance",5,2024,04,22
204,5 Stars?,"This place fancies itself a 5 star hotel, but it didn’t seem like it. Upon check in they gave me the wrong room. I had booked and emailed to confirm. In went back down to the desk and said there must be a mistake. They got me a room with a tiny balcony. They claimed it was a result of a “new system,”. Sure, it happens. The room was a lot smaller than advertised. The bed was too firm and uncomfortable. Pillows were thin and hurt my neck. Shower was lovely, good pressure. Bathroom was small, but nice. The hotel inside is beautiful. We ate breakfast there every day. They didn’t even bring toast. One day they brought me the wrong omelette. It happens.  One day they brought my wife’s eggs Benedict without hollandaise sauce!  The bar was a total clown show. Amateur hour. We were drinking whiskey at the bar, so we had a front row seat. The young kid, who was obviously inexperienced, served our first round of whiskey neat in a wet glass that was still hot from the dish washer. For the next round we tried a different whiskey and he used the same glasses! I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. While sitting there, I saw a bartender shaking a drink with no ice. I said to my partner, “There’s no ice in there.” Bartender must have heard me because he went to the ice bucket and put some in. One night we ate dinner in the bar because the city was crowded, so we figured just eat in the bar, which was less busy. I had the soup because I wasn’t super hungry. In Ireland, you get bread with soup. They did not bring me bread. I had called the night before we left  to arrange a taxi for the airport and the gentleman I spoke with had told me we’d have a van or bigger car because we had 3 people with 2 bags each. A small car pulled up that we managed to squeeze into, but add that to the list of niggles.  The bar is very sloppy; it seems like there is a lot of inexperienced employees working there. It’s pretty obviously a cost-saving move, but they are cutting the wrong corners because I was really looking forward to my stay there, but it was disappointing because these little niggles added up. The service was not 5 star quality; it’s a bunch of inexperienced people fumbling their way around the hotel cluelessly.",3,2024,04,21
204,Fabulous Staff Location and Room,We had visited before and we delighted to return and we were given a beautiful refurbished room overlooking St Stephens Green. The staff were all very friendly and the breakfast went on to 12 on the Sunday and the bank holiday morning which meant you could relax and enjoy the weekend. The breakfast was extensive and the food was delicious. The location is ideal for shopping and entertainment. Thanks to all the hardworking staff .,4,2024,04,01
204,"A wonderful, comfortable hotel.","My son and I shared a small room during his spring break from University in America. The Fitzwilliam was a perfect location. We walked everywhere (Trinity College, St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Guinness, Jameson, Temple Bar) and always had a comfortable and attentive spot to return to.",5,2024,03,31
204,Average Stay,"We stayed in one of the newly renovated rooms, but the hotel still seems very outdated. Definitely not a 5 star hotel feel, but rather a low-end 4 star. The carpet especially is a must go in the rooms as it looks so dated. Tried to close the blinds and the string broke off and the hotel never fixed it even when asked to. The safe didn't work initially and we had to call to get it fixed, but even then we struggled a bit with it. The bathtub was peeling so it definitely didn't give a luxurious. Standing shower would have been a better option than a tub. Also, the bathtub is super dangerous getting in and out of because it is so high! I almost slipped and hit my head getting out. We as a younger couple managed, but I can't imagine an older person trying to get in and out of a tub like this. The breakfast at the hotel was pretty good & lots of options, but the view sucks. The hotel is very conveniently located in a great part of the city as well! Overall hotel staff made this stay very pleasant, but we would most likely not return due to it's lack of features & aesthetics.",3,2024,03,27
204,"Great experience, would stay again.","The Fitzwilliam Hotel was an amazing experience. They checked us in early and the room, as part of our package, was amazing. At arrival they were able to check us in a couple of hours early and offered breakfast since it was so early. After we were taken to our room, luggage arrived within a few minutes. There was a knock at the door a few minutes later and we were greeted with delicious cookies. At turn down, a small box of chocolates was left on our pillow. The mini bar contents were complimentary. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay again.",5,2024,03,27
204,A superb hotel,"Superb hotel. The staff were great, very courteous and friendly. The best run hotel I have stayed at. The room was beautiful - it had a view of St Stephen’s Green and was tastefully decorated. And the breakfast was delicious. A wonderful place. Will definitely return.",5,2024,03,14
204,Fantastic 5 Star Stay,"We had a great weekend away staying at The Fitzwilliam Dublin, The room was immaculately clean and comfortable. From the moment we arrived until we departed the staff couldn't do enough for us always going over and above. Breakfast was also amazing with a great selection to chose from. i would highly recommend here to anyone and the location is perfect.",5,2024,03,13
204,So much for five stars.,"Great location. Beautiful property but under renovation.  One issue no hot water (it was virtually same temp as cold water) on second morning. When you are leaving at 515am, one is left with no options.  It is unacceptable for a five star hotel not to have hot water.    Front desk said well we are under renovation.  No compensation or remedy.  So much for five star hotel.",2,2024,03,10
204,10/10 Perfect Dublin Stay,"From the moment we pulled up outside the hotel - we were treated and welcomed like a beloved family member coming home.  Every member of staff from the knowledgeable concierge team, reception check in,  couldn’t do enough for us. (2 rooms booked)  As a first time visitor to the Fitzwilliam in Dublin, I felt so comfortable and relaxed, this hotel will be my forever go to stay when in Dublin.  The general manager, Fergal O’Connell even sent us up delicious treats of cookies and brownies to our rooms.  The beautifully appointed,  refurbished rooms, were stunning and contained everything one would need to make your stay memorable, you even get your very own umbrella for those notorious Irish rain showers! The hotel has the perfect location right at the top of Grafton Street, overlooking the beautiful St Stephen’s Green.   I can’t wait to return.  Thanks to everyone for looking after us so well.",5,2024,03,02
204,An almost  brand new bicycle with deliberately slashed tyres,"Three things first; the hotel is superbly located in the centre of Dublin. The staff are wonderfully helpful and professional. The bedrooms are very comfortable, even those with zero outward views (in other words looking into another building). However if you are expecting 5* ambiance think again. 
The Foyer and its furnishing is more reminiscent of a village bus station rather than that of a 5* establishment (if that works for you that's fine but at over $500 a night maybe a makeover is well overdue). The bar/restaurant has the allure of a tired Wimpy Bar (for those who can remember them) this one probably designed by a teenage Goth with a sever migraine.
Please wake up and make it pleasurable to use your hotel or let someone else develop it into something really special",3,2024,02,26
204,A BRILLIANT AND FANTASTICALLY RUN HOTEL,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel , we have been to this hotel many many times over the years and why do we keep coming back you may ask ?  its for the friendliness and atttention to detail its just outstanding in our opinion.

204,Our best hotel experience ever - strongly recommend,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay at the Fitzwilliam.  I requested a quiet location and Pauline and staff at reception gave us a perfect room and took care of us in every way.  The room was quiet, comfortable, and cozy.  Their help made this an outstanding stay.  The concierge service was above and beyond - including helping us book train tickets, tours, and reliable early morning transportation.  The hotel bar was a perfect place for a nightcap.  The entire staff made this a wonderful, low stress trip.  We have been traveling for 45 years and this hotel is top on our list.  Thank you.",5,2024,02,14

I only have wonderfull, great memories. The staff, the breakfast, the beautifull room, the cocktail I had and all the details. Comfortable and luxurious in a relaxed atmosphere. Most important the human touch that made me feel at ease and at home away from home. . ",5,2024,01,23
204,Wow A Real 5 Star Hotel.,"From the moment you arrive to the minute you leave you realise you have just received the absolute best standard of service you have ever enjoyed in all your travels.

On arrival Carlos welcomed us in the most friendly but efficient manner. He explained all the facilities in great detail and gave us a lovely cool glass of fizz. He then gave us a voucher for a free drink at the bar and then personally escorted us up to our room which he had upgraded us to. What a start.

Every single member of staff that we encountered after that replicated his attention to detail and always with a smile.

Nothing is too much trouble for this staff as they really do go out of their way to show that they truly appreciate your custom. The food is also superb and the Hotel has been furnished to the very highest standard.

Special mention to the Concierge from Ukraine ( sorry I forgot your name, it must have been the Guinness) his advice and service was truly appreciated.

We will return soon.",5,2024,01,22

204,The best location ever for Dublin City,"This is an excellent hotel from every point of view. Let’s start with the location. St Stephen green cannot be beaten by anything. This is the safest area of Dublin just a few steps from Grafton street and all fancy restaurants and bars. Simply superb. 
This is a 5 star hotel that has an amazing value for money. The hotels located close to fitzwilliam have around the double price. 
What you get in a 5 star hotel is the personnel. This is what is particularly missing in Ireland. There is no stuff in 4 star hotels I ve been and this here made the difference. You leave your car out of the hotel, your luggage is being carried, your car parked, peace of mind in everything. 
The rooms are really good. You can feel that everything is quality built, everything is sophisticated and placed properly. Everyday there was something waiting for us in the room, like a small chocolate and always accompanied by a small letter from the hotel direction and this was particularly nice. I liked it. It is something not met in other hotels. 
The mattress and the pillows are simply superb. The room is really so quiet. 
I didn’t like the lack of a complete shower but it really didn’t matter. Maybe that can be a problem for older people. 
Checking in and checking out was superb. 
All stuff was extremely polite and always willing to help. 
What I didn’t like, otherwise could say I expected something more, was breakfast. Breakfast is  not at the level that the  rest of the services stand in this  hotel.  I am travelling a lot and I can make comparisons. I really expected a lot more. However given the superb price for this 5 star hotel I wouldn’t really mind because I’ve been to 1.000€ /night hotel in Ireland and breakfast was still not satisfactory. Maybe the breakfast in Ireland  is something different and has its own standards. 
In the room there is everything needed. A nespresso coffee machine, there is a mini bar without extra charge. 
This is a really good hotel. If you can afford it then choose it, I don’t think you can find something better in Dublin. Location matters the most. This is the best place to be.",5,2024,01,02
204,Great hotel,"Great service and hotel . Staff were very friendly. Great location, perfect for shopping and being beside all the action on Grafton street. Valet parking was a nice add as it can be hard to get parking around there ",5,2023,12,26
204,Not great,Rooms and location are great but unfortunately not the best hospitality for a 5 star hotel. Price is ok but more of a 3-4 star hotel. I was there for one night and won’t be coming back anytime soon. It,2,2023,12,23

Ralph at the front desk was so nice! He gave us a complimentary upgrade to one of the premier suites which had a balcony overlooking St Stephens Garden. So cool!! You could tell Ralph really wanted to make our time in Dublin special. When we returned to our room, we found large, made from scratch chocolate chip cookies from the head chef. When we complimented them to the front desk, they sent up even more cookies! The front desk staff (Especially Ralph) was very attentive and professional.

The hotel is very centrally located to shopping , restaurants and theatres.

204,A great place to spend a weekend in Dublin,"This is a great venue to explore Dublin. The location is first class. It’s a Cracking hotel, and very friendly staff. Highly recommended and you get what you pay for. I would definitely stay here again",5,2023,10,30
204,"Great Staff, great location, room was ok","Great Staff, great location, room was ok. The front desk and door staff were amazing, definitely the high point of the stay. The location is also great, right at the corner of St. Stephens Green, and close to some great shopping and restaurants (The Bar was great for watching the Rugby World Cup, and The Well was a great time in early evening with the kids and seemed to get quite lively later in the night!). The rooms could use some freshening up, as they were not of the same quality as the rest of the experience.",3,2023,10,30
204,I would recomend it!,"This is my second visit and I would say overall it is comfortable and good. However, on my last visit last month I could have some apples next the lift but now it is a pot of flowers. I really hope if they can keep it up and provide free parking and drinks. Otherwise there are plenty of other options in Dublin (Staycity, Clayton etc etc), I will see how my next experience is in few weeks or months again!",4,2023,10,28
204,Birthday Bliss !!,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel , we have been to this hotel many many times over the years but had taken a break and explored other fine hotels in the last two years , decided we needed to return again for my birthday ,  from the moment we made the booking with Maria Kriskova,  oh how we were looked after personally by her thanks Maria  - allocated one of my favourite rooms - besides the Penthouse obviousily !!  as I love a quiet room and it sure was , what a nice  newly refurbished room overlooking the garden  and a birthday suprise waiting for me such a nice touch - this makes the hotel stand out !!!  remembering all the small finer details ,  of course on arrival we were met by the great Victor - he should be nominated for the employee of the year in our opinion !   he looked after our luggage and our dinner reservation .

Highly recommend this hotel for its staff and beautiful rooms . ",5,2023,10,25
204,Not a 5 star experience,Breakfast a shambles served by very poor staff. Requested coffee 3 times & had to go to kitchen door to place hot order. 6 other guests with 4 staff serving ! Room very clean as we were upgraded luckily,3,2023,10,24
204,Five-star stay at the Fitzwilliam Dublin,"Staff was very welcoming and friendly. The hotel is relatively small but my room (standard, queen bed) was a good size, very clean, quiet, and comfortable. Value was excellent. Location was very convenient to public transportation and near the major sights--right next to Grafton street, and a 10 minute walk to city center. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,10,23
204,Average,"Would rather stay in a lower grade hotel nothing special other than decor, disappointed essentially and wouldn’t stay again- I wanted magical special, and got mediocre -even this 200 minimum words is ridiculous !! Make it wonderful",3,2023,10,23
204,Fabulous,"Our room was beautiful, every detail, the bed was huge and very comfortable. The rooms have been recently decorated and are luxurious, so quiet and simply stunning. 
The lighting in the bathrooms was great. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony on arrival which was an added bonus and a lovely feature to be able to open the door and look out on the green. The staff couldn't have been more helpful. ",5,2023,10,20
204,Fabulous!,"We recently spent 5 days and nights at the Fitzwilliam. From start to finish it was excellent. We had a Deluxe Premium Room which was facing the garden. It was very quiet and peaceful. The room was recently refurbished. Every amenity in the room was great from the bed , bathroom and sitting area. The breakfast everyday was very good. We also ate in the Inn on the Green and once again the food was great. The entire staff from front desk, restaurant, bar tenders, Concierges and housekeeping were top notch. Can't say enough about them. Every night we would have a cocktail by the fireplace in the lobby. A great way to end the day. The location of this hotel cannot be beat for exploring Dublin. Literally a short 2 minute walk to Grafton St. and across the street from St. Stephens green. I strongly recommend you consider the Fitzwilliam when visiting Dublin. You will not be disappointed.",5,2023,10,18
204,Best Hotel in Dublin,This hotel is beyond your expectations. Rooms are lovely and the staff go above and beyond. Being so central to Stephens Green Park and Grafton Street is also a plus. This is our second stay at this hotel.,5,2023,10,18
204,Awesome stay,"We enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliams. Wonderfully friendly staff, who were very helpful. We asked to change rooms after our first night, due to a baby having a hard night next door to us. The staff accommodated our request without any problems. Lovely stay.",5,2023,10,17
204,Exceptional Hotel,"The hotel and staff are exceptional! They treated us like family. When we returned back to the hotel they warmly greeted us by name. I would highly recommend this hotel on its luxury, location and exceptional staff! Special shout outs to Concierges - Victor and Fabian; Bartenders - Killian and Lewis; Front desk and breakfast staff!",5,2023,10,16
204,First Ireland trip,This was our first trip to Ireland. Before we traveled we had high expectations and the staff at the hotel helped to greatly exceed our expectations! Everyone was SO friendly and also really good at their jobs. Tremendous positive experience.,5,2023,10,16
204,Topped off an enjoyable tour of Ireland ,"This place is all class.
Best quality accommodation in the heart of Dublin. 
The stand-out  feature is the staff. There was a genuine willingness to help and sincere connection at every interaction. I would like to particularly mention Victor. He went over and above to assist us upon  arrival.",5,2023,10,14
204,Nice stay but not quite 5 star ,"Lovely hotel, would question if it’s a 5 star hotel though.
Arrived at 10am ish on the first day of our holiday and we were promptly checked in and allowed access to our room straight away which is great to freshen up after a early morning start and enabled us to rest before heading out for the day. 
We stayed in a newly refurbished room, it was really well decorated, some small touches though that were missed were some exposed wiring behind the headboard and a chipped and stained bathtub. 
Fresh towels and room turned down daily with chocolates and fresh bottled water was a nice touch but expected from a 5 star. Free WIFI. 
Cons -
Strong smell of sewage every evening on the 2nd floor just as you come out of the lifts and leaving on Monday morning we were awoken by the noise of the renovations going on, this is fine and understandable that the business has to function around it’s renovation but a warning would have been nice. Also having to carry our bags up to the 3rd floor to access the lift to come back down as the  2nd floor lift wasn’t accessible on Monday morning due to renovations.   
Checkout process was smooth and a very reasonable checkout time of 12pm. 
All staff were very friendly and polite. ",4,2023,10,09
204,Recommending Fitzwilliam to the highest ,"An amazing hotel for a getaway to Ireland. I have great experiences from
my interactions with the staff. The room is luxurious, and the hotel breakfast is marvelous. It is one of the best hotel breakfasts I have experienced.",5,2023,10,06
204,Inexcusable not to warn of renovations,"
Good location for a tourist.   Walking distance to parks, museums and theatres.
Quick check-in by knowledgeable and professional staff.

Room was adequate (323) but certainly didn’t enjoy walking thru the construction-remodel-renovation occurring on third floor.  I would have stayed elsewhere and should have been notified at booking.  Apparently it was full because I asked to be moved later that evening and they never contacted me about it.
This is an inexcusable failure by Fitzwilliam…renovation-remodel is not why I stay at a full price property.",2,2023,10,06
204,Dublin City Trip,"Overall great stay. We had a signature room with a small balcony overlooking Stephen's Green. Top locaction, very good breakfast buffet, not so good Irisch Breakfast. Very nicely decorated and very clean. Attentive staff.",5,2023,10,04
204,"Top-notch accommodations, great base for daily adventures","Located across from beautiful St. Stephen’s Green Park, short walking distance (< 5 minute walk) to tons of shopping/pubs/restaurants, 10-15 minute walk to museums/Temple Bar, 20 minute walk to EPIC & the river front. Our room was clean & well appointed, staff was very friendly, breakfast was delicious…the room came equipped with a golf umbrella (very handy).",5,2023,10,02
204,Great Stay - Great Hotel,"Really enjoyed the stay at the hotel - the location, food, service is excellent. The staff go over and above to ensure every element of your stay is excellent. The new rooms are fab. They have thought of everything!! ",5,2023,10,02
204,Dublin visit,"Great hotel and overall stay. Clean, modern, fantastic service and a great location. We walked pretty much everywhere as the location was perfect. Personalized service such as having a to-go breakfast ready at check-out for an early ride to the airport.",5,2023,09,29
204,Topnotch Hotel!,"I highly recommend this hotel! The Fitzwilliam is in a great location for shopping, touring and access to transportation. The staff was very helpful from check-in to concierge to housekeeping and wait staff.  We'll definitely return!  ",5,2023,09,28
204,First trip to Dublin,Trip was with my mum who is 75 Room was tired - was on 6th floor which meant had to carry bags up one floor - as no lift - I think we should have been made aware of this - noisy bathroom pipes when other rooms used shower - this noise only stopped after midnight ,5,2023,09,24
204,A very enjoyable stay,"This is a really welcoming hotel, well within walking distance of most tourist attractions and business districts. The rooms are modern, comfortable and spotlessly clean. The staff are warm and friendly. Will be back.",5,2023,09,24
204,A very personal stay!,"Staff were so lovely and helpful at check in. Couldn’t fault the place at all. We had a slight issue with parking that was resolved very quickly! Great location also, views from our room were lovely looking out over St Stephen’s Green! Will definitely be back! ",5,2023,09,22
204,Class in Dublin,"A wonderful hotel! Service is flawless and professional. Viktor, a concierge, was a source of excellent support with all of our needs. The room was clean and quiet, lovely beds. Would absolutely stay here again.",5,2023,09,20
204,Perfect!,"Great location. Beautiful rooms. Great staff. Great breakfast.  We had a wonderful stay and I highly recommend this hotel. Very responsive staff, very friendly and helpful. We were close to walking to many stores and restaurants ",5,2023,09,19
204,Superb,"Can’t fault the place. Excellent staff, friendly courteous and helpful. Great room and central location in Dublin. Breakfast was great. Only regret I couldn’t stay longer. Has become my favourite hotel in Dublin. Happy to recommend ",5,2023,09,17
204,"As usual, a very comfortable stay","Room 320 was very nice indeed from all aspects, apart from AC control. Room size, design, bathroom amenities were excellent. Desk staff in the lobby were very polite and willing to help. The Bar/Restaurant at the ground floor was good. The breakfast was excellent and the staff were quick and willing to help when there were time constraints. This was highly appreciated. ",5,2023,09,17
204,Just too many issues,"Great location, lovely receptionist at check in who showed us to our room. The room was just ok, didn’t really have the 5 star wow factor although the mini bar was a fab extra. The bed was quite small and the room very hot, we couldn’t seem to get the air con working well at all. Despite a few issues we were happy enough and just got on with our holiday. 

What we really felt was unacceptable was some interactions with staff. Some situations arose which should have been dealt with so much better in a 5 star hotel. 

The bar really lacked atmosphere and luxury. It was very basic. 

House keeping walked in our room twice on check out day two hours before checkout time. Then at ten mins until checkout continues to bang on our door until I answered and said we where making our way out. We get very few mornings off and felt this relaxing opportunity was ruined. Upsetting after paying so much for the room.

No real interactions on checkout. No one asked how our stay was. 

We stay in a lot of hotels and are repeat customers to so many across Ireland. There where definitely too many issues for us to use this hotel again especially for the price point.",3,2023,09,16
204,Excellent stay in a great location,"The staff was wonderful and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable. The location couldn't be more perfect for shopping, walking in the park and pub/restaurant visits. Even with all the local amenities, it was still quiet enough.",5,2023,09,12
204,The Fitzwilliam,"Small rooms showing age ( not in a good way ) , shower was like a phone booth. Staff was very nice and helpful. Good location for shopping or going out to dinner. Just overall overpriced for an average room. We booked a ""Deluxe"" room and got a standard room in my opinion. Which was after turning down the first room (broom closet) they tried to put us in. The second was better , but not worth the money.",3,2023,09,12
204,Top notch welcome to Ireland,"Convenient walkable location to city, excellent accomodations, and attentive, helpful staff! Breakfast options were tasty and plentiful and service was always prompt. Thank you for your dedication to your guests’ comfort.",5,2023,09,12
204,Special Treat,"The location of Fitzwilliam Hotel is fantastic. The surrounding area is convenient to great shopping, restaurants and pubs. The opulence of the interior is beautiful and the friendly reception team is so welcoming. The pillows are amazing and the well stocked minibar was enjoyable. The breakfast is such a treat, although the service was extremely slow with no apologies for forgetting our order which is unfortunately not what you would expect. Overall, we look forward to once again staying at this beautiful venue!",5,2023,09,11
204,Short business trip,"Great short stay. Staff super friendly and professional. My room was beautifully laid out and had all I needed. The location is very central and everywhere is walkable. St, Stephens Green which opposite and fabulous",5,2023,09,07
204,Great hotel with quality service and good rooms,"From check in, use of business centre, concierge services to breakfast everything was perfect for a quick business trip to Dublin city centre. Located right at a tram stop on St Stevens, this is a great location to explore Dublin and get to businesses nearby",5,2023,09,07
204,Gorgeous rooms,"Great location, the ultimate luxury in a hotel room coupled with great service and in suite amenities. We stayed in the Deluxe room and I imagine all the other rooms just as nice. My third time in Dublin, I’ll be back to this hotel. 

",5,2023,09,06
204,Fabulous Hotel in great location,"The Fitzwilliam was an extraordinary hotel.  We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight.  The staff promptly found us a room.  The room was attractive and clean.  The breakfast was fabulous, although there was too much on the buffet, meaning we left stuffed every morning.  The concierge went far beyond what was asked of him.   ",5,2023,09,04
204,Amazing service with lovely rooms!,"The staff was so wonderful here!!!   Although the rooms and hotel itself are absolutely lovely, the staff was even more amazing!!   Helpful, professional, and personable...  The location of the hotel is perfect to get the feel of Dublin in a short time.   I enjoyed shopping, self-guided walking tours, and a lovely educational carriage ride all within 24 hours.   ",5,2023,09,03
204,Great stay,Recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam and enjoyed it very much.  The hotel is well located and clean and in good condition.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent and there was a nice (on the quiet side) bar area.  ,5,2023,09,02
204,Wonderful experience.,"Wonderful experience.  The hotel has a beautiful ambiance throughout. Staff are friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. The bedroom was top class with a fully stocked mini bar. The entire hotel has such a relaxing atmosphere and is located central to everything Dublin has to offer. Can’t wait to stay here again",5,2023,08,29
204,"Stylish, quiet and comfortable hotel a hop and step from Grafton St. Great value and fabulous staff","Comfortable and spacious room for an inner city hotel. We were in the newly refurbished section which was quiet and delightful. Mini bar was included. Breakfast was very varied with many cold and hot options, it was delicious. I had requested a room with a bath and that was acknowledged at checkin and delivered. All staff, without exception, were excellent. Whether it was the concierge staff (all friendly, proactive and responsive) the breakfast staff(all polite and cheerful) or the lady we met in the lift, all made us feel welcome. I will definitely stay here again when next in Dublin",5,2023,08,26
204,"Excellent hotel, breakfast opening hours was an issue","Excellent hotel in a superb location.  Reception staff were superb and were real ambassadors for the hotel.  The only downside was the availability of breakfast.  Hotel stated breakfast was available from 06:30, failed to deliver on the start time.  No access in the lift to the breakfast floor until close to 06:40 and waiters seemed surprised that guests had turned up at such an early hour.  Very disappointing.",3,2023,08,24
204,"Great location, fantastic amenities and staff","Our stay was simply fabulous.  From check in, to cleanliness, to breakfast, to location and to checkout all was perfect.  Highly recommend this hotel.  We had a group of 6 in 3 rooms and we were conveniently located by each other.  The breakfast options were plenty with great service. ",5,2023,08,21
204,Grew location and great staff,"Visit for 3 nights for my husband’s birthday. Lovely birthday wishes in the room on arrival and free upgraded room.
Despite an upgraded room we didn’t feel it was as large as we thought but everything finished to a good standard to give that feel of luxury. 
Shower amazing and bathroom spacious.
Complimentary mini bar was a nice touch- wasted a bit on us as we don’t drink but nice to enjoy the soft drinks- thank you!
Breakfast really good- much better cooked when the lady chef was cooking it!!! Service great each morning with lots of choice.

Didn’t realise the hotel had a hairdresser on site which I definitely could have made use of- bumped into her as she was closing and had a lovely chat - wish I had known about this sooner.  Maybe a point for reception to advise on check in.

Location is the big selling point - a stones throw from everywhere you want to be.

The only criticism was the bed wasn’t the most comfortable for us, a bit lumpy and divan creaked when turning. ",5,2023,08,18
204,One of the most comfortable beds,"Very polite and helpful staff, excellent breakfast and a very comfortable bed.
Super-convenient location right on Stephen's Green
Slightly confusing access to the room due to the refurb works, but not an issue.",5,2023,08,18
204,jewel in Dublin,"The hotel is excellently located at St Stephen's Green Park, close to Grafton Street, and central Dublin restaurants, pubs, and, many attractions.
The staff is very well trained, and efficient, responding immediately to guests' concerns or requests. Special mention to Ralph, Angela, and Maurizio at reception, and Irene in housekeeping, Concierge staff were impeccable, with great recommendations, and went the extra mile to provide assistance with directions, and booking activities, special mention to  Viktor and  Samuel.
Breakfast was delicious, with a great variety, of both cold and hot dishes, prepared freshly to our requests.
Rooms are standard size for Europe, with great bedding, and quiet and the hotel strives to provide special attention to its guests, with details to every aspect of a great stay.
 I can't emphasize enough what you are rewarded with service  and personal attention, in a great location: priceless
",5,2023,08,15
204,Booking.com disappoints again,"Our room faced steel ladders / back of an alleyway. Unbelievable constant noise / waiters dumping botyles in trash all night & movement activated light on bill board outside our window.
 Listed building with little of the charm.
Shower minute, wonder whether all men fit.
Helpful front desk recommended restaurants & parking tips.",3,2023,08,14
204,5 Star Experience,"From arrival to departure was very well looked after, all the staff were very friendly and helpful,Justine on reception , Viktor the concierge who helped with booking Michelin star restaurant  and the LOVELY Maria who put lucky shamrocks and smiley faces on our coffees.Food in the Bar very tasty.
Very central for all shops and right next to the park.",5,2023,08,11
204,Disappointed,"Poor check in process.initially management would not allow me and my elderly disabled mother, who was flying international on an overnight flight from US to check in early and the manager that day had a very non-customer service like attitude that came off as rude and condescending.  Telling me at one point “ you should have flown in a night before if you wanted an early check in ! Pluses were all other staff especially folks Samuel the concierge and Maria in the restaurant, Mostafa very accommodating however, this first impression left a sour taste, but the interaction of the management. On my first day I stayed at this hotel 10 years ago, and had a much more pleasant experience and hence why I returned now I’m second-guessing myself if I should do it again",2,2023,08,09
204,"Excellent Hotel, would stay again","This hotel was quite nice.  I would definitely stay here again.  I had made a reservation in a different hotel, and was told at the last minute by an Irish friend that the neighborhood where that hotel was had changed and I shouldn't stay there.  I found the Fitzwilliam by accident and thank goodness.  We drove by the original hotel and it was in a dicey neighborhood.  The Fitzwilliam was ideally located, right on St Stephen's Green.  This made it quiet and calm but literally steps away from many many things tourists would want to do.  The rooms were clean and extremely comfortable, well appointed, spacious, and generally excellent.  The staff however deserve a call-out - they were most excellent - friendly, helpful, catering to any request with a smile.  It used to be that this was not notable in a nice hotel, but these days I find it is unusual, and to find that all of the staff at the Fitzwilliam were like this was quite a pleasant surprise.  I would definitely stay at this hotel in Dublin again.  ",5,2023,08,07
204,a very nice hotel in beautiful setting,"we stayed in Dublin in the Fitzwilliam Hotel on St. Stephens Green.

204,Happiness at the Fitzwilliam Dublin,Our second time to Fiztwilliam Dublin. It is a beautiful hotel with tremendous service and perfectly located.  We love the balcony rooms that look over Stephens Green.  Breakfasts had lots of hot and cold choices and the staff was great there. The concierge staff is very knowledgeable and attentive. They even worked with Fitzwilliam Belfast when we were going there for the day and wanted a black taxi tour.  Victor and Fabian were wonderful.  ,5,2023,08,06

It is a massive upgrade with a beautiful room with especially nice bathrooms, modern technology, loads ot socket plugs and mirrors which are often forgotten about. Great location near Grafton St and St Stephens Green. Will recommend.",5,2023,07,27
204,Definitively Not A Five Or Four Star Hotel.,"This is not a five or four star hotel. It is around 2-3 stars now.What a shame! Blood stain on a pillow, forever to get food served and generally so scruffy. Given the prices they charge, it is a joke. The noise all night was awful too and the tv stations a joke. Spent 40 minutes trying to cast to tv from phone to watch Netflix or anything, frankly. No dice. Gave up.",1,2023,07,26
204,Very nice hotel in the center of Dublin,"Great hotel in a great location. The rooms overlook a garden and it was very quiet and peaceful.

204,Great hotel. Lovely people and perfect location,"Hotel was a in a fantastic location , pretty and  near everything. Hotel staff was lovely and welcoming.    The terrace room was beautifully appointed . Very luxurious My only issue was that it was just too small . There was no place to put our luggage , no shelves or drawers for clothes except for a small hanging closet . I would definitely recommend the hotel but might forgo the terrace and view to the park for a larger room . ",5,2023,07,21
204,Wonderful Hotel in Central Dublin,Spent 8 nights here recently with my family and had the most wonderful service and experience.

A truly delightful welcome from friendly and professional staff started our weekend break.

204,Business with family,I always come to Dublin for business on a yearly basis and stay in the hotel for at least 2 weeks. Usually my family stays with me as well at least during half of the trip.

204,Great central hotel for Dublin visits,Spent 3 nights here after 2 long flights and was very welcoming. Undergoing some renovations wasn't really an inconvenience due to the warm friendly nature of the staff. A nicely run hotel with well trained staff made for a pleasant stay.

               Fitzwilliam Hotel is the quintessential ,archetypal hotel  because of  it's location across from the park.  Upon entering, you are greeted by a warm-hearted, vibrant, helpful   concierge team.  For 9 days  we were in the quietest  hotel room in my lifetime,  overlooking a beautiful private  garden that excludes any noise other than the  chanting  of the occasional visit  from a flying park visitor with some flying friends.
           
             Justine asked us several questions  so she could select  the most appropriate room and the 3rd  floor was perfect with closet space, desk counter, bed end tables, a plethora of lighting options, coffee, espresso,teas,  and a refrigerator where you are supplied  initially with juices,soda, and a mini bar  provided as a welcome. Glass bottled waters are provided daily.Restful, beautiful in the room with a view, thank you E.M. Forster, as we found that room in Dublin and we intend to return.

          Serene sleep and a morning menu and a buffet of various breakfast options, all very healthy and extremely delicious with  bread, fruit, coffees, teas,in general, a royal breakfast included with your stay. There are meals provided after noon until approximately  10pm. The chefs and mixologists are excellent.

     A 5  star requires an excellent hotel manager.Monica transcends  excellence, smiles and cares sincerely, asking if we would like or need anything. She is respected and her staff looks upon her with favor. A congenial concierge, Victor spoke to us  daily about the weather, festivals, restaurants and asked us if there was anything he could do for us. Moreover, Sarah in the bar lounge is  friendly and informative about interesting features in Dublin and the surrounding areas. The mixologists are masters.

         Enjoy the Fitzwilliam when you arrive in Dublin city centre!",5,2023,06,20
204,"Nice location, somewhat dated, mostly clean","The staff was great, the hotel is nice, the room was ok, some dirt in the cracks and corners, cabinets can't be fully shut, it's a little dated but generally clean and looks nice. The bed was clean and comfortable, the bathroom was clean and functional. There were no smells. Small TV with a lot of missing channels (feels like some roadside Inn). There was some noise in adjacent rooms during the day, likely some remodeling. The location is adequate if you are looking to be a tourist and to shop in Grafton street, it is fairly central and a short walk to places to visit. Breakfast was good. Grover's alley is right there but the dress code excluded us. Price to value: This is not Paris, NY or London, and there isn't much in the hotel itself, so I would say fairly pricey for what we got, plus the minibar is not included. We missed the complimentary newspaper, fresh orchids and freesias.",4,2023,06,19
204,Second stay at The Fitzwilliam,"My second time staying at the Fitzwilliam. Excellent location, friendly helpful staff, lovely clean room with really nice bathroom. Hotels in Dublin are expensive but for a 5* it wasn't much more than 3 and 4* nearby. ",5,2023,06,19
204,Fantastic hotel,"We had a great experience and the Fitzwilliam made our time in Dublin very memorable. From the location to the staff, everything was excellent. The breakfast was delicious and was the best of the entire trip. I would highly recommend staying here!",5,2023,06,18

204,Dublin at St. Stephens Green,The Fitzwilliam Hotel is in a very good location for walking the popular areas of Dublin. The room we had was on the small side and less comfortable than other hotels we stayed in on this trip. However the staff and service were excellent.,4,2023,06,17
204,Great Location and Service,"The service was superb in every way.  The concierge welcomed us and helped us with dinner reservations and tickets.  The waitstaff was also very friendly at breakfast.

204,Don't miss this incredible hotel!,"What a spectacular stay! We were upgraded to newly renovated rooms and felt very spoiled by the amazing service provided by the staff at this hotel. Our rooms were lovely with garden views and the beds, towels, everything really just were perfect. The location is ideal on St Stephens Green and we were able to park our car with valet service. We enjoyed the bar and dinner downstairs along with the breakfast on the mezzanine in the morning. ",5,2023,06,13
204,Horrible service and experience ,Very sad experience. This was the worst service. We had a dinner here and it took 1 hour and 15 minutes to finally get our food. Then it was wrong. They said they had a lot of room service orders. Keep in mind there were only 3 other tables with people in the restaurant. This is supposed to be a 5 star. We paid a lot to stay here. Horrible. Please stay somewhere else. Try The Green Hotel. At least they care. We had friends stay there and it was much better than the Fitzwilliam. ,1,2023,06,12
204,Oasis of calm,"A wonderful hotel, with great facilities and great staff. You couldn't ask for a better location, it's walking distance from all the places you want to see in the city but also close to the LUAS tram line and a taxi rank for longer trips. ",5,2023,06,06
204,Good location,"We were asked if we were celebrating an special occasion my husband said yes our anniversary. We didn’t get a such as a bottle of champagne as gift, only the welcome cookies they give to everybody. Our first late night they assigned us a room that had a bathroom with a big window top to the bottom that was facing the bed in the room. We wanted to close the blinds in order give privacy to bathroom because from the room we were looking at the toilet. The blinds didn’t work. We requested to move to another room that had a a traditional arrangement and it was comfortable. Breakfast was good. Friendly and helpful staff.",3,2023,06,05
204,Great trip to Dublin,"A wonderful trip to Dublin made even better by the friendly, helpful staff at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The hotel is convenient to all kinds of attractions-the historic Dublin Castle, City Council, Trinity College, shopping, great restaurants and fun pubs, the Temple Bar district and the wonderful park (Stephen’s Greene). Even the weather cooperated-gorgeous sunshine and  warm weather but not too warm. A great trip and a great experience at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. ",5,2023,06,04

204,Great option on the Green,Stayed three nights in May 2023.  The hotel is well appointed and contains an outstanding restaurant Glovers Alley.  Staff are courteous and helpful.  Room size was more than adequate.  Soundproofing was great.  Room for improvement in breakfast buffet and in temperature control in the room.  Also no hot water one evening.  ,4,2023,05,20
204,Great Hotel in Great Location,The Fitzwilliam is a great hotel located in the heart of downtown within walking distance of wonderful pubs and resturants.  The afternoon tea is amazing and the rooms are updated/clean.  You will not be disappointed with your stay. ,5,2023,05,19
204,Overpriced but great location and rooms,"Staff are first class, very welcoming but also giving a slightly pretentious feel at the start of the experience. Breakfast was good and service there first class. Bar staff are excellent and very friendly.",4,2023,05,17
204,Nice but inconsistent,"A corner room with minimal light, broken blinds, and a primary desk light with broken dimmer switch. Couldn't charge my phone as staff would turn off all lights and power as soon as I left. Both breakfast orders were once wrong, and once forgotten ",3,2023,05,17
204,Dublins finest hotel,"Exquisite service, spotless rooms, friendly, welcoming atmosphere. I would never stay anywhere else. From front desk to checkout - staff are amazing and helpful. Fabulous location, luas adjacent making getting around the city east, and a beautiful location to come home to! ",5,2023,05,15
204,Dublin city stay,Excellent location with good restaurants and bars close by.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  The food in the restaurant and bar was good with prompt service.  As a swimmer the only negative was that there is no pool and the hotel does not have a rate with a local pool.  Otherwise an excellent hotel.  ,5,2023,05,04
204,Exceptional Hotel for your Dublin stay..,"This hotel is one of the best places we have stayed --ever.  From the porter coming out to the taxi to welcome us and assist with the luggage to the front desk staff, our stay was amazing.  
The location is perfect, next to Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green.  The light rail is across the street, but it is an easy walk to most Dublin attractions.  
The rooms are large, comfortable, quiet and clean with lovely amenities.  The decor is traditional and classic. 
The breakfast included a large buffet as well as selections from the menu.  The food, service and selection in the bar was excellent. 
What sets this hotel apart from other luxury hotels is the staff -- each and every one we encountered was there to ensure our stay was the best.  The concierge epitomizes the role, happily sharing his knowledge and expertise. 
There was not one experience we had at the Fitzwilliam that did not exceed our expectations. ",5,2023,05,04
204,Excellent,"Can't be bettered - I'm unable to comment on value because the room was on account and I didn't see the bill, but this hotel is a real gem - brilliantly positioned, very obliging staff and lovely room witha great shower, huge bath and very comfortable bed.
Table service at breakfast was a refreshing change and the breakfast itself was delicious.",5,2023,05,04
204,Great service and friendly atmosphere,"I had a great stay at The Fitzwilliam. Extremely friendly and service minded staff. The room was a bit tired, but clean and spacious and I slept amazingly well in the bed. Breakfast was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2023,04,26
204,Perfect Location for a Dublin City Break,"Excellent in many ways. 
Location is perfect for a little Dublin City Break, We arrived earlier than specified check-in time as you do trying to get the early check-in, Greeted by a very professional and polite receptionist who cannot go without been named Merle (could be spelt incorrectly apologise if so), She was excellent very welcoming and really gave us the 5 star feeling from the start to in fact even checking out. Our room was spacious and with some lovely views of Stephens Green, while been so close was still quite. We are lunch in the Inn Bar and it was very tasty young barman on his own didn’t get his name very nice chap with a genuine love for his Job and Cocktails. All in All the Hotel is a excellent and we will be back time and time again.",5,2023,04,26

204,Perfect stay at a perfect location.,Perfect location for everything you need to see and do in Dublin.  The hotel overlooks the beautiful St Stephen’s  Green and is also surrounded by important Irish history.  You are surrounded by the best shopping and restaurants Dublin has to offer.  Would very highly recommend a visit.,5,2023,04,22
204,Kindness,"I just witnessed a wonderful customer service where an older man had locked himself out of his room and couldn't remember what room he was in being cared for in the most wonderfully respectful and kind manner by Jorge and his colleague. They didn't see me watching so it was such an authentically kind interaction
 It made my day to see such humanity ",5,2023,04,20
204,Lovely,"Beautiful hotel, ideally situated in the center of Dublin, right accross from the park and next to Grafton street. We greatly appreciated the valet service and the friendly staff. Very nice rooms, double bed bit on the small side though. Nice breakfast.",4,2023,04,15
204,A wonderful stay!,Without a doubt book this hotel! It’s an amazing central location near all the incredible shops. The service is top tier and the rooms were clean and beautiful. The free breakfast included was incredible and you could order what you wanted it wasn’t just a buffet. You are also near the hop on hop off bus so you can buy a ticket for that and explore other parts of Dublin and do the Guinness Factory tour. Highly recommend this place!,5,2023,04,11
204,Fabulous Hotel,"Had a wonderful stay at  this hotel right in the heart of dublin city, steps from the gaiety theatre and Grafton street area. 
Staff, Service and overall a wonderful experience from check in to check out ",5,2023,04,10
204,Greg property with great views,"Overall my stay at the fitzwilliam was great.  The staff was amazing, the location is great, the food was good, and the hotel is very nice.   My only slight critique is that the furniture in the room might need to updated just a tad.   It wasn’t bad/ugly by any stretch of the imagination, but I did expect it to be a little nicer.  It didn’t at all affect my trip or enjoyment, but it could have been improved a bit",5,2023,04,08
204,The hotel you hoped it would be.,"This is a friendly, stylish and conveniently located hotel. The service is excellent and the breakfast is particularly good, nothing was too much trouble and gluten free options available. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,04,08
204,Fab hotel but terrible WiFi ,"LOCATION: Great location in the middle of Dublin just a short walk to Grafton Street. Journey from the airport by car was around 30mins with light traffic. 

STAFF: The staff at this hotel were all lovely, friendly and very helpful. Concierge delivered my bag to my room, reception assisted in changing my room from twin to double and restaurant and room service staff were all very helpful.

GUEST ROOMS: I was put in a newly refurbished room, colour scheme has moved from the darker purple to lighter shades of green and orange. Bathroom was sleek, amenities were lovely although they missed a shaving kit (was banking on having this as I travelled with hand luggage only) and bath salts. The bath is huge so salts would have made the whole experience that little bit more luxurious. The rooms are relatively quiet, although when the neighbours flush toilets or turn on the water the pipes in the ceiling are quite noisy. Bed was really comfy and cosy. The room also has a mini bar fully stocked as well as tea and coffee making facilities with a Nespresso machine. There is also an iron and ironing board as well as robes and slippers in the wardrobe. 

FOOD: Room service was fast and food was delicious. I also ate in the hotel bar, similar menu and same quality of food. Breakfast was serves on the mezzanine level and again all well prepared with a lovely selection on offer. Continental buffet plus you have a menunto order cooked breakfast options that are made fresh, not left whithering under some old heat lamp. My only complaint.. no low fat milk option and no sweetners, they are still using the old fashion lumps of sugar in a sugar bowl. How many grubby hands had been round that before I got to it.. I'm all for sachets now thanks. 

NEGATIVES: WiFi is terrible, it kept dropping out so the hotel clearly needs a booster to ensure the WiFi reaches and stays strong in all parts of the property. The only other negative I have is the gym is not a gym really, it's a tiny windowless room with a couple of cardio machines and some very light dumbells. Okay for those just looking for something very simple, but didn't accommodate my needs. That said there is a Pay As You Go FlyeFit Gym on St George's Street just 10min walk away you can pay €12 a session to use that. It's a good gym with plenty of kit for a solid workout.

It was a very enjoyable experience, thank you to all at the Fizwilliam Hotel",5,2023,04,04
204,Location is what makes this hotel,The hotel is lovely. The room was lovely. The breakfast was really disappointing for a 5 star hotel. We ate in the bar but it was quiet depressing with no windows. The food was not great. The location of the hotel was great ,4,2023,04,04
204,The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin made my first trip to Ireland a memorable one,"This has been my first trip to Ireland and hopefully the first of many more to come. The Fitzwilliam hotels in Dublin and Belfast has helped make this a most memorable experience. All of the folks working the hotel are very friendly and accomodating. I would like to give a very special thank you to Victor Sandoval for his phenomenal customer service skills as well as great interpersonal skills. Victor helped make my experience at the Fitzwilliam that much better by always being a fun person to speak with at the bar after spending a day touring Dublin. The Fitzwilliam has a great group of people working for them in Dublin and Belfast. I will be sure to recommend these two hotels to anyone planning to visit Ireland. 

Respectfully,

Sean H.",5,2023,03,27

Very simple check in process and clear instructions from the staff. 
Good assistance from the front desk staff printing a boarding pass. ",5,2023,03,06
204,Not a 5 Star hotel ,"Past it's prime. Staff wants to be friendly, but this place does not and will not work: The elevators have the date on them: 1997. and the rest of the hotel feels like it's from 1997 as well. without any improvement or investments: The most depressing ""gym"" I have ever seen in a hotel. scuffed up equipment, un-sanitary (sweat stains all over the treadmill), the free weights weren't in pairs... The lock system on the room door didn't work.. three times in a row. 3 trips to the front desk and I still couldn't get into my room. I wasn't even past my  check out time. the door locks didn't work at  10am in the morning. Staff were trying to be friendly but the bellhops couldn't find luggage and retrieving luggage took a while.",1,2023,03,05
204,"Staff, Staff, Staff","Arrived at the hotel on Friday 24 February to be greated by warm, welcoming staff and a glass of prosecco😁. We had arrived a couple of hours before check-in but were able to access one of our rooms and a staff member accompanied us to the room to ensure everything was OK. I had emailed the hotel before our arrival asking for rooms next door to each other and they were able to meet this request. Later in the day we went into the bar area for more prosecco, on leaving we mentioned that we had booked dinner for later that evening and asked if a table could be reserved. The bar staff asked what table we would like and reserved it right away. All the staff we came in contact with were so friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend the hotel to family and friends. Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable.",5,2023,02,27

204,Not 5 star,"Stayed in a deluxe room at the hotel but I definitely would not call it that. It had a great view over Stephen's Green but that was all. Room decor was very outdated, it was cramped and the room looked like it hadnt had a deep clean in a long time. There was dust behind the minibar press and stains on the carpet as you walked into the room. The tiles around the bath were all uneven and didn't match as if there had been a patch up job done. The bed creaked when just getting into it. Will not be returning.",1,2023,01,15

The pretty rooms are very comfortable and daily breakfast is delicious. A special shout out to the concierge, Victor who was incredible! We would stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel again!",5,2023,01,09
204,Maybe four but definitely not five star,"Erm….really not sure how they can describe themselves as a ‘boutique five star’ hotel. There’s nothing boutique or five star about it. 

The location is great but that’s the only positive. We were charged €409 for one night in a tiny room. Yes, that included breakfast but even so…

We did have access to a balcony which turned out to be clambering through a window onto the roof.   The corridors are old and tired and smell of stale, fried food. The bedroom we had was not much better. The heating was turned up quite high but there was no way of getting to the controls. Someone from the front desk had to come in and remove the radiator façade and adjust it himself. 

Breakfast is served on the mezzanine level, overlooking the main entrance. It’s weird. It has the ambience of an airport lounge. Our first waiter was about 12 and didn’t speak English well. Our order was slow to arrive. There were five or six serving staff and what looked like one chef. 

We had valet-parked our hire car with the hotel. On checking out, we asked for the car to be brought round. After 15 minutes, we went looking for it ourselves. We found the man in the carpark and took over from there. Not like we had a plane to catch or anything…😳

Sorry, Fitzwilliam, but we will not be returning.",3,2023,01,09
204,A great place to stay for Christmas! ,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel for Christmas with my family. It’s always a big decision choosing the right hotel for Christmas and I certainly felt like we made the right choice going here. We stayed in their newly refurbished rooms and they were extremely smart and cosy. The hotel is situated near Grafton street which was perfect for some last minute shopping and soaking up the Dublin atmosphere! The food on Christmas Day was absolutely delicious, would stay here again for Christmas. ",5,2023,01,03
204,Really lovely hotel to stay in,"Great location. Extremely welcoming, all staff were lovely and very helpful, couldn’t do enough for you. Rooms very good, breakfast well presented and delicious. Overall the hotel across all areas provided excellent service and experience. ",5,2022,12,21
204,Luxurious hotel in a central location!,"Our first stop on our first trip to Ireland was The Fitzwilliam, right on St. Stephen’s Green, and it couldn’t have been better. We splurged for a room with a balcony looking over the square and it was wonderful! The room itself was very large and well-appointed, and although we looked out over the square we were high enough up that it wasn’t noisy at night. Service was very friendly and proactive, and breakfast was delicious and abundant! Strongly recommend.",5,2022,12,20
204,Very happy stay,"Everything was super positive especially the consierge  team. They were truly excellent. Overall a really good stay. Right up till this second…. However now I am still working through a survey that’s far far too long, Wroting anything so I can hit the 200 character minimum, wouldn’t be impressed by that at all… but the stay was great ",5,2022,12,18
204,Excellent,"I stayed for the third time at the Fitzwilliam this week; I was in one of the newly renovated rooms with a gorgeous bathroom (deep tub, stunning tiles), but what keeps me coming back is that the staff are always so friendly (shout out to Luis) and how close it is to everything in town- but it feels like a world apart. Clearly a very thoughtfully and well-run hotel!",5,2022,12,16
204,Will return,"Excellent location, reception, room service, cleanliness - meticulous in all respects. Room particularly comfortable and super-efficient,  spotlessly clean and remarkable quiet for a city centre location..",5,2022,12,16
204,wonderful stay in central Dublin,"the room was lovely the staff welcoming and friendly. Good breakfast. Couldn't be better located.
The electric charge points for the car were a godsend in the centre of Dublin. Made the journey hassle free.
Very comfy hotel
",5,2022,12,13
204,Excellent service and warm welcome,"You can only expect 5 star service at the Fitzwilliam, with warm and friendly staff. From booking, to reception, bar, everybody were so helpful. Our stay could not have been better, the team at the Fitzwilliam never disappoint. ",5,2022,12,11
204,Comfort,"Yet another stay at this great Hotel. If its comfort you want, then this is the place to stay. The staff are brilliant, and cater for your every need, food is good and the rooms spacious and comfortable. great location",5,2022,12,09
204,Superb Quality indulgence and the staff are just wonderful,"I would like to say i have stayed at some beautiful hotels in the world but the Fitzwilliam is without a doubt my favourite, from the valet to the front reception staff, to the newly refurbished rooms it is all 10 stars. I would highly recommend anybody to stay here, it is are indulgence, quality and 6 star service steps away from Grafton street. I adore this hotel and its meaning of Ireland!",5,2022,12,05
204,Christmas trip,"I stayed with my daughter and sister to do our Christmas shopping,the hotel staff from start to finish where so friendly, helpful and nothing was a bother to them Mr O Connell  has a wounderul team there.",5,2022,12,05
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel,Super hotel and we love our stay there every year . We never bother looking at any other hotel . The whole experience from Front Desk to Checkout is always First Class . We’ll be back before too long .,5,2022,12,02
204,Our pre-Christmas treat,"We loved our stay from start to finish. The staff were exceptional from checkin-in to departure. Concierges went out of their way recommending and booking restaurants and then, afterwards  following up with us to check if we were happy with their recommendations. Bar staff were so professional and deserve a special mention too. Lobby looks so welcoming and the Christmas decorations put you in the Christmas spirit immediately you walk in....a Winter Wonderland!",5,2022,11,30
204,Theatre Night,"We were delighted with our stay and treated like Royalty.  Everyone went out of their way to assist us.  Thank you so much for making such a memorable stay.  Prosecco on arrival as we were celebrating our anniversary, complimentary upgrade etc.  The Balcony room was just fabulous overlooking St. Stephen's Green.

We can;t wait to come back again.",5,2022,11,28
204,Wonderful hotel experience,"I stayed two nights over the weekend to adjust to the time difference before my business trip. I loved my experience at the Fitzwilliam - it was clean, staff was attentive, and I appreciated all the small conveniences including apples in the lobby, a water kettle & nice selection of in-room teas & coffees, and small gestures such as treats/cookies at turn down service. The only minor convenience was the heavy bass from the music at the nightclub/bar next door that I could hear faintly through the walls but earplugs and my sound machine app helped reduce it. The windows are double paned for noise reduction so you cannot hear the street. Overall, I loved so many things about the hotel and my room that the faint noise will not deter me from staying here again.",5,2022,11,27
204,The best location!,"I wasn’t sure whether to book or not based on other reviews but the price and location was right so I ended up to book and didn’t regret at all.
Let’s start from the beginning:
-My flight arrived in the morning and my room wasn’t ready so I was desperate to take a shower and change. They provided me a shower/ bathroom that they called “the day room” but basically it was just a shower and not a room. It was what I asked for though and was very good. However if take a shower you can’t use a hairdryer as due to the law they can’t plug in anything in the shower/ bathroom.
Later on I realized there was a hairdresser room in the hotel so I could have booked it to take care of my hair for blow dry/ style.
- I loved the concierge’s recommendation: they were very helpful and Fabian was the best
- service was impeccable 
- on the last day I realized everything in the fridge was free
- the chocolate was excellent( every day they put a small chocolate bus in the room 
- the location was perfect",5,2022,11,27
204,"Warm, Friendly, Lovely Hotel","The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin is a centrally located, beautiful hotel with lovely staff, excellent service, and large, clean rooms. We visited there in Nov 2022 and were always happy to return after a day exploring! It's close to shops, restaurants, pubs and the wonderful St Stephens Green! ",5,2022,11,26
204,A home from home in the centre of Dublin,"While on a short trip to Dublin my husband and I stayed here for two nights last week.  From the moment we arrived at the front door until the morning we were leaving, our experience was just wonderful.

We knew we would arrive before noon and therefore, did not expect our room to be ready.  So, we asked the receptionest if she could store our luggage away as we had an appointment early afternoon.  No problem.  To our surprise while having a quick snack in the Inn on the Green bar, she came in and told us our room was now ready and took us up to see it.  She was so kind and explained everything to us in detail.  The breakfast was just superb and had a wonderful choice to suit everyone.  What we appreciated very much was that a menu for hot food was placed on every table and the food was cooked to order.  Therefore, no waste.  Excellent as we are living in difficult times.

The location of the hotel is perfect as the lucas tram is directly across the road from the front door.  Therefore, you can either take it to go across the city centre or in the opposite direction out towards Dundrum where there is a hugh shopping centre.

Thank you to everyone in The Fitzwilliam for making our stay such a memorable one.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2022,11,26
204,Quick stay in Dublin,"This hotel is a great location and convenient to walk to many sights. Wonderful staff, great food and drink, plus valet parking. I would definitely stay here again, I only wish I had more time to explore. ",5,2022,11,26
204,a week in Dublin,"I read a lot of reviews on trip advisor before deciding on a hotel for a week's stay in Dublin. I'm glad I went with the Fitzwilliam. It may not be 5-star by some standards (and having stayed at historic 5-star hotels, I agree it's not at that level), but it is a lovely hotel, with a bright, airy lobby, a relaxed and simple breakfast space on the mezzanine, and a perfectly nice bar off the reception area. Breakfasts were really good, lots to choose from. The people are  friendly without being obsequious or aloof. Mairtin the concierge knows everything about the city, and was so patient with our questions! We were on a transaltantic flight that arrived at 5:30 am. They made us as comfortable as possible, and managed to get us into a room by 11:00am––which we much appreciated! Unfortunately, it was not the room we requested (facing the Green). After 48 hours someone did call to follow up, but by then we were settled in and didn't want to make a fuss. The ""superior"" room was a decent size (it could get stuffy, but the window opens a crack) and the shower was super hot. I just wish we could have had the view for my first time in Dublin, especially at an average of $370 a night.",4,2022,11,25
204,"Great location, excellent staff, gorgeous hotel. ","We stayed here for 2 nights and couldn't fault any part of it, lovely clean spacious room, really attentive friendly staff, great food and drinks. Perfect location across from Stephen's Green and on the top of grafton Street. I'd definitely stay again! ",5,2022,11,23
204,Old Friends having overnight in Dublin. ,"Four of us recently stayed for an overnight at this hotel. We picked it mainly because of its excellent location, and its 5 star rating. To be honest, it's a good 4 star at best. It lacked character and atmosphere.  The breakfast left a lot to be desired. Staff were pleasant,  but lacked initiative , flair and friendliness. While one must wait for a freshly cooked breakfast, a half an hour is too long. Presentation was poor, an overloaded plate, lacking the finesse a 5 star should deliver. Bacon was poor, waitors were not on the ball, all in all a poor experience. ",4,2022,11,22
204,First class service,When you stay at the Fitzwilliam you are guaranteed first class service from all the staff. Great central location. Every time I stay at the Fitzwilliam I feel very comfortable there. It’s a very homely and welcoming environment ,5,2022,11,22
204,Great stay,"Very warm welcome, got upgrade to St Stephen green view , great room  very clean,some nice touches free mini bar , the staff all very friendly,Good breakfast nice choices,very claim, even take away coffee,we stayed in room 404 ,we hope to return soon ",5,2022,11,21
204,Disappointing for a 5 star hotel,It didn't feel like 5 star service. Staff were very friendly. The breakfast area was very cramped.   We were on top of people either side of us. For the same money we could have got another 5 star hotel with a lot more finesse. This was an expensive treat for my birthday but lacked finesse big time for 5 stars. Overall Disappointing.,3,2022,11,21
204,YOU CAN NOT ASK FOR ANY BETTER.,"I travel  alot and am picky. We were there for 4 nights. Everything about this hotel experience exceeded my expectations. The Fitzwilliam Hotel has standards that are of a bygone era.  There was a doorman. We were escorted to our room by a  front desk person to make sure it was satisfactory. (Very nice). A few minutes later the porter brought our luggage. The room was lovely, modernized  and overall spacious with a sofa. It had a mini-bar with one complimentary Irish whiskey sample. But what impressed me the most was the breakfast experience. Food good and service was impeccable. The staff had exceptional  decorum and made sure every desire was met. This is a small but impressive thing- they  walked (like glided) with their hands behind their backs when not serving.  Great decorum! FYI they make a great latte and they WERE SO HAPPY TO BRING ME A SECOND ONE!  In addition, we  ate dinner in their  pub  upon arriving late. It was well decorated and had lounging areas. The food was food.  We enjoyed Dublin very much and will go again. I will definitely stay there",5,2022,11,18
204,A perfect stay,"We were only here for a night after traveling around Ireland but once we got here, we wished we were staying longer. The concierge was so friendly and helpful, the room was absolutely wonderful. We are planning to return to Ireland in a few months and will be staying a little longer here next time. ",5,2022,11,17
204,Best place to stay in Dublin,"We had stayed in the Fitzwilliam several times pre-pandemic, and have always appreciated its location, underground carparking and modern comfortable rooms.  It was great to be back.  I think it is even better.  The room we stayed in appeared to have been remodelled and was well laid out and comfortable. The staff were also exceptionally friendly and helpful.   ",5,2022,11,13
204,Amazing Stay ,"I just had the most amazing stay here from the minute of check-in to departure. When checking in the receptionist informed me that I had a free room upgrade, very nice indeed. The room itself definitely had the wow factor, so high spec with no issues whatsoever. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I must give a special shout out to Victor the Conceirge, he's a true gent. Hopefully I'll be back in the New year.

 ",5,2022,11,08
204,Great Hotel,"I was impressed by the friendly staff, cleanliness of this hotel, and convenience to public transportation, shopping, restaurants/pubs in Dublin.The concierges we’re pleasant and polite. They helped me schedule an early morning taxi to the airport so that I could avoid road closures and traffic on marathon day. They also offered umbrellas for the rainy weather.",5,2022,11,05
204,long weekend,stopped off in Dublin after a vacation in France for a couple of days. the location was perfect for our plans.the nightclub next door wasn't (very loud) That's why I gave an average for sleep quality. I would definitely use again during the week.,5,2022,11,03
204,One of the best hotels I have stayed in,"The hotel was quiet, clean, and well presented. We got a free upgrade which was so nice. It was in a great location, the staff were lovely and the breakfast was brilliant. We had an issue with our shower but didn't report it at the time as we didn't think it was worth the fuss for one more morning but I am 100% sure the staff would have leapt into action had we chosen to.10/10",5,2022,11,03
204,Dublin break,Great break in Dublin. All amenities within easy reach of hotel. Lots of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance and hotel is straight across the road from st stephens green park plus the shopping centre of st stephens green is right beside the hotel.,5,2022,11,02
204,Business trio,"Great city centre location. excellent car parking facilities with electric car charging points. Modern and clean hotel with a great breakfast. Friendly staff throughout this 5 star hotel.
Nice décor in bedroom and bathrooms. ",5,2022,11,02
204,No sleep at this hotel,"We spent 2 nights at this 5 star hotel. We booked a deluxe room and the tiles on the bath were hanging off as the grout was old. 
We paid over £300 a night for the room and there was no breakfast included which was shocking. 
We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night and we were kept away till 2 and 3 am as there is a couple of bars and nightclubs underneath the hotel and all we could gear was the base of the music and people laughing and screaming. ",2,2022,11,01
204,Lovely Hotel & Staff But No Chance Of Sleeping,Lovely hotel and staff but there was a nightclub next door that played v loud music until 3am both mornings that we stayed and ruined what could have been a great experience. Unfortunately couldn't take a chance on this not happening again.,2,2022,11,01
204,If You Want To Sleep Fo Not Stay in This Hotel!,"Fitzwilliam has much to recommend it … location, generally friendly staff … but you should not stay here if you want to sleep.  The noise from the neighbouring bar makes it impossible to sleep. Despite pointing this out to the staff/management nothing was done about it.  I had a 10 day booking over Christmas/New Year which I immediately cancelled. I will never stay here again. In 50 years of staying in hundreds of hotels around the world I have never had such an unpleasant experience nor a more unresponsive management.",1,2022,10,28
204,5-Star Treatment,"I was slightly concerned that there were some mixed reviews about the quality of the hotel and service of the staff. My stay at the Fitzwilliam was immediately after a stay at a legitimate 5-star in Edinburgh, which was likely to spoil how much I appreciate other hotel stays. 
However, I was surprised how every staff member seemed to genuinely care about me and my girlfriend... friendly,  courteous, and helpful are not strong enough words to describe the staff. 
Additionally, the room had a great view of the park and Grafton St.
I look forward to staying at the Fitzwilliam the next time I visit Dublin!",5,2022,10,26
204,Double celebration,"Fab hotel and fab location. Walking distance to shops, restaurants and bars with a beautiful park outside fo an early morning stroll. Great food and beverage too. Must try the afternoon tea next time we go. ",5,2022,10,26
204,Very average,Very small room tucked away under the roof in the far corner - very average overall and not worth the premium price > €200 a night. I would find a different hotel next time in Dublin. Only the location is good and central.,3,2022,10,21
204,Wonderful service and stay,The team at the Fitzwilliam really made us feel welcome. The service was consistently excellent throughout the stay. The room was furnished to a high standard and was very comfortable. I'd definitely stay here again.,5,2022,10,20
204,Excellent stay,The hotel is in the perfect location to explore Dublin. Friendly and helpful staff is always available. Rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Excellent views of the park. Highly recommend staying here! ,5,2022,10,19
204,Sadly no longer functioning as a 5 star hotel,"This very attractive hotel in an excellent location no longer justifies its 5* rating or prices. The staff were working hard but appeared poorly trained, no sign of a manager at any point during a three day stay, frustrating problems at breakfast with cold coffee, and staff who did not know the word ‘nuts’. They did their best, but clearly lacked senior support. The room had broken drawer, stained blind etc. the valet parking system only worked in fits and starts. The rooms were cleaned well, but communal areas were grubby over the weekend. ",2,2022,10,18
204,Level 4 stinks with dirty carpets that are not vacuumed,"Piecing together carpet at the threshold in different colored pieces on floors that are not vacuumed, stained, and stink clearly states that this is a place that does not care about cleanliness. Somehow their rating exceeds that of The Grafton a block away. ",1,2022,10,16
204,"Convenient location, friendly staff and excellent service","The hotel has a fantastic location, close to the city center where you’ll find different restaurants, stores and a very active night life. It’s within walking distance to the St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the Bank of Ireland and Trinity College as well as the famous Temple Bar. The staff at the hotel is very friendly and the rooms are cozy and clean. My only issue is that they seem to have a humidity problem right in the lobby of the hotel and you notice a particular smell when you come in. The rest of the hotel is fine, just the lobby. The gym lacks a proper gym but you have St Stephen’s Green park across the street, where you can exercise with the proper attire. ",4,2022,10,16
204,Best Hotel in Dublin,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. They accommodated my every need. Their bathrooms are amazing, including a tub that can fit a six foot person! It has an old style, classy hotel vibe—like something you’d see off Home Alone. I absolutely loved it. AND THE LOCATION!!!!!! Amazing hotel. And their room service was to die for!!!! Absolutely loved them. I will be back.",5,2022,10,16
204,Terrific and Conveniently Located Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed in one of the smaller rooms with a queen bed for three nights. The room was cozy yet comfortable. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Great breakfast, too! Highly recommend.",5,2022,10,13
204,Great location for Dublin activities,"This is a great hotel located within walking distance of everything in Dublin that is fun to do. It was clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful with information. We rented a car but did not need it from this location. We walked all around the city and it was easy to find the hotel.",5,2022,10,11
204,lovely weekend away,"Excellent Location right in heart of city Dublin 

friendly staff who are very attentive  to your needs 

Bar area is only thing  would need updated as you are abit closed off and not much atmosphere ",4,2022,10,10
204,Excellent Staff and Location,"The positives are the location and the staff. Also the breakfast which was really lovely and very well presented.  The bed was comfortable and there were nice towels and toiletries and bathrobes and slippers and a free mini  bar. 
The negatives were the room and its location on the 6th floor. There was no lift to the 6th floor and the room 624 felt tired and there was a noise like a generator running. There were missing tiles on the corridor roof  on the 5th floor and I just felt the hotel needed a revamp overall.",3,2022,10,09
204,"Amazing experience, 5 star service",One of the top hotels in Ireland. At the center of everything in Dublin. Walking distance to everything. Service was 5 star. Would recommend to anyone. My wife and I loved it. We were escorted to our room by the front desk person. Just first class all the way. Always made us feel welcome.,5,2022,10,09
204,Excellent location and service. Rooms in need of upgrade,"The location is excellent being a short walk to the main shopping areas, Trinity College and old town Dublin. Similarly, the service provided by the staff was excellent and very personable and the breakfast offered a good selection. The downside is the rooms are in desperate need of an update. The furnishings and carpet are quite worn and not what you would expect from a hotel of this price. I have to admit that we were incredibly disappointed with the condition of our room and would rate it at no more than 3 stars. At the end of the day it becomes a balance between location and quality.",4,2022,10,09
204,"Great location, great service","Fabulous stay with genuine hospitality. Great location and superb breakfast. Highly recommended.Situated opposite St Stephens Green park entrance, perfect for an early morning run or walk. Easy access to Grafton St and Temple Bar.",5,2022,10,07
204,Great property in good location.,"Checking was simple room was great. Bed was medium to firm and with jetlag I slept 13hrs! The shower pressure was great, drainage not as quick so bath filled a little but it was a good shower - over a bath. Concierge were lovely and I would recommend this hotel.",5,2022,09,30
204,Overpriced,"Good city cent location staff are very friendly and nice 
Checking in was lovely unfortunately the rooms are very dated and in need of  deep cleaning 

Carpet was full of stains and was the bed cover 
Bathroom is need of deep cleaning as tiles and grout are very dirty along with stains on woodwork  for the pics they charge is was not good enough ",2,2022,09,26
204,Not as advertised,"I am writing this review while I am laying in bed listening to the banging, water running and voices from the room next door.  Just wrapping up a holiday from western Ireland where we stayed at a wonderful 5 star resort and this hotel does not compare.  I would rate it a 3 star hotel based on the condition of the rooms, the noisiness, and the lack of posh.  The staff is wonderful and the location is great,  but don’t expect 5 star amenities.",3,2022,09,25
204,Lovely hotel on the green,"The Fitzwilliam has a wonderful location at the bottom of Grafton street, on St. Steven's Green. It's walkable to everywhere in the city center. The hotel staff is friendly and so so helpful. They have a nice bar and a fantastic restaurant. The hotel is a gem at this price in this area. ",5,2022,09,24
204,Favorite Dublin Hotel,"I always enjoy staying at the Fitzwilliam.  Great location, great service, large rooms w/ very comfortable beds.  I particularly enjoy the rooms with balcony or terrace.  The staff are always friendly and helpful.  ",5,2022,09,23
204,Great Location in Dublin City Center,Read all the reviews and I had concerns and almost didn't book there.  The three rooms I stayed in were all great with a few minor quirks.  Don't be afraid to stay there.  Great location and nice hotel.  Be careful of the rooms on the second floor right above the bar downstairs in one corner of the hotel.  You'll know what I mean when you arrive and you are assigned a room.  Incredible bedding especially the pillows.  Comp frig with drinks was a nice touch.,5,2022,09,21
204,Old towels and noisy,The towels were old and rough. There was so much noise outside my window from the Mexican bar below that it prevented me from sleeping. The other choice of closing the window left the room stuffy. The bed was comfortable and the bed linen was too.,3,2022,09,18
204,City break,Excellent location.   Very clean hotel and the concierge team are fantastic.    The hotel staff are all very friendly and helpful.   Rooms are great.   Will revisit and stay again.     One of the best places to stay in sublime ,5,2022,09,16
204,"Beautiful hotel, great location","Just to say this hotel was not only lovely and a fantastic location but the staff were superb! We travelled to Dublin for my 40th birthday weekend in July and the staff were so lovely and attentive and the rooms beautiful. I would like to sing the praises of the hotel bar staff… not only did they make the most delicious cocktails (especially the espresso martinis) but they were so lovely to us both and made us feel very welcome…with thanks to Tom, Luke, Liam and Aoife for making our stay so special. Highly recommend a visit to the hotel bar before going out and  about",5,2022,09,08

204,Should be rated a 5 Star!,"We traveled all over Southern Ireland & stayed at several different hotels. This 
hotel was charming, clean,  easy room & elevator access, close to shops, restaurants, and pubs. The entire staff went above & beyond! I rate them a 5 Star because of service!

204,"very nice, city hotel","We stayed here the first night after our fight from JFK to Dublin at the start of a 10 day Ireland trip. It’s in a good spot, a city hotel (rooms on the smaller side), very comfortable. We went in August and Ireland rarely gets hot so the A/C in this and all the other hotels on our trip do not crank out frigid air like some American hotels do.
We had a courtyard view and slept with window open, and with the exception of some loud squawky sea gulls, it  was very quiet. 
The mini fridge in the room had a bunch of alcohol nip  bottles, plus water and Coke. I didn’t touch them (used to those being an upcharge) until the front desk assured me they were ALL free, which I thought was super nice!",4,2022,08,13

Sleep Quality: the double rooms are very small, with small beds, though firm and comfortable mattress

204,Excellent stay at the ideally located Fitzwilliam Hotel,"I was slightly hesitant booking this hotel after reading some of the negative reviews but went ahead anyway.  I was not disappointed.  Many reviews mention ""this is not like other 5 star hotels I've stayed in"" - and I would agree with that, this is not going to compare to the Sofitel St James in London that we stayed at later in our trip.  But it is a lovely hotel in its own right.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable (yes the carpeting in the hallways was a bit old and stained and a bit smelly, but we didn't spend much of our time in the halls!)  The staff was friendly and attentive, though the concierge could have been a bit more helpful about dining suggestions for a family with preteen children.  The location could not have been better, right on St Stephen's Green, not a far walk from the Temple Bar district or many of Dublins other amazing attractions.",4,2022,08,07
204,Excellent Stay,"The Fitzwilliam is an excellent hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Our room was ready upon arrival and very clean. St. Stephen's Green right in front and Grafton Street right around the corner, we loved the location. Perfect location for everything Dublin has to offer.",5,2022,08,07
204,This is where to stay in Dublin!,"From start to finish, I loved staying in this hotel.  The location can’t be beat. The staff is very professional but very friendly as well!    The breakfasts and the staff were perfect….best I had in Ireland.   The concierge was able to get me a last minute dinner reservation late on a Saturday night. Most importantly, I foolishly left something important behind. The very efficient housekeeping staff immediately found it and Sebastian arranged to get it to me via courier.  This was no small feat but he acted like it wasn’t a problem.  I truly appreciated the effort.   There are many beautiful hotels you can stay at it in Dublin but this is the ideal choice.   This hotel offers value, elegance and top service.",5,2022,08,05
204,Awesome Stay,"Highly Recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin it was truly a great experience  for myself and my family..  I would also stay there for a business trip as well based on location,  services  and the food in the restaurant and the bar..",5,2022,08,01
204,Great staff and awesome location.,"We visit ever other year as a golf group.  The hotel has exceptional service, comfortable rooms and really great food.  The bar is welcoming — best whiskey sour on the planet.  The location is perfect —right at the start of Grafton Street.",5,2022,08,01
204,Very Nice Hotel,Great location on Stephens Green Dublin to allow you to experience the heart of Dublin all within walking distance -  the Guinness Store House is a 20 minute stroll. The Luas stops outside the door if you are feeling a little more adventurous ,4,2022,07,27
204,Nice hotel centrally located,"Nice hotel centrally located but lost some points for:

1 . Garden view room literally just looked over a very plain courtyard with nothing really appealing about it.
2. The room we were given was directly beneath re-construction work where the workers worked until last 10 pm even though they stated that they don’t. I understand reconstruction/renovation work is important but not into the late hours. 
3. Faulty shower tap what went from hot to scolding hot with no easy means to turn the water temperature down. After much forcing of the tap it finally turned enough to allowed the temperature to be properly adjusted.

Overall central Dublin used to be a prettier and cleaner city back in 2018 when we first visited but now it just looks grungy and dirty with more homeless people around.",4,2022,07,21
204,"Perfect location, high quality stay","The hotel is perfectly located on St Stephens green park and walking distance to everything. The quality of the room and bathroom were very good, and the friendliness top notch. There were lovely touches, such as homemade cookies in the room to greet us and nightly chocolates on the bed.",5,2022,07,18
204,Not up to snuff,The hotel is in a great location and the staff is nice but the rooms are tiny and outdated and filthy. Trash litters the hallway.  It is definitely not a 5 or a 4 star hotel and maybe not even a 3 star hotel.,2,2022,07,16
204,A Respite From The Energy Of The City,Excellent location across the street from the park and a block from Grafton Street. Staff are attentive and professional. Well appointed room which overlooked a garden. Very peaceful. Disappointed we did not have time to sample the restaurant.,5,2022,07,16
204,A Very Nice Hotel,"I kind of feel bad for giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 but I just cannot say it rose to the standards of a 5 star experience, even though the staff were very nice and the location is superb. Perhaps it was because on our previous stay, we were at the Shelbourne and in comparison, this hotel was a little lacking in poshness and room decor. We had a large ""family"" room with a king bed and pull out sofa for our daughter, but we were very surprised at how small it was (the description said up to 4 people but I can't imagine having 4 people in that room) and the decor was a little drab compared to the photos. The pullout sofa mattress was so poor, I felt awful making our daughter sleep on it, it was so thin and lumpy, she literally sagged down between the metal railings. My biggest issue was the tiny shower...for almost 800 Euros per night, you shouldn't have to shower in a tiny box that you can't even bend over to shave your legs in.

As mentioned earlier, the staff were all very attentive and the location was wonderful. Dinner at Glovers Alley was a highlight as well. I just wish the room itself had lived up to expectations.",4,2022,07,14
204,Fabulous Location. Wonderful staff,"We stayed in rooms on the courtyard. They were bright and comfortable. Lovely bench seats along the window. Lots of closet space. The bathroom had an especially deep tub. Although a bit worn, the rooms were immaculately clean. It was quiet. There was no noise from outside or nearby rooms, though you could hear everything that went on in the hallways. 
A nice touch - The rooms had umbrellas, as did the concierge desk. 
Extra electrical outlets would be  a bonus. 
The breakfast was very good. We also had tea in the bar on our first evening. It was really unique. The gin smoked salmon in a seaweed cone with a lime and avocado mousse was amazing! 
The hotel is in a perfect location. We are big on walking when we travel in new cities and we found all of the sights we wanted to see and restaurants we wanted to visit were in an easy walk. (Easy for us is anything within 30 minutes)
The staff here was friendly, knowledgable and professional.  We, like many this season, had our flights cancelled multiple times, and they accommodated us for the unexpected extra nights without having to swap rooms every night. The concierge team was very helpful. 
We would definitely stay here again.",4,2022,07,09
204,Fabulous stay!,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam. The location was amazing! Plus, the hotel team was professional, the room service salad and soup was delicious and fast, the bar/restaurant was open until late hours for ease, and the check-in and check out was easy breezy. The only downsides for my stay was the lack of power outlets in the room and the bath toiletries was a bit strong with masculine scents. Overall, a wonderful stay! ",5,2022,07,09
204,Great experience,"Wonderful staff, very friendly and helpful.
Nice room and great location.
Would definitely go back and recommend.
Food at breakfast and lunch was wonderful. Would be even better if there was more international selection at breakfast.",5,2022,07,02
204,Great Stay at the Fitzwilliam Dublin,Great location- right on St. Stephens Green. It's close to everything. The rooms were very clean and well appointed. The breakfast was delicious with many choices both hot and cold. The staff is VERY friendly and helpful. ,5,2022,06,27
204,Definitely not “five star” or value for money - travelers beware!,"Had a four night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel which claims a “five star” on its website. Both customers and those who review and allow use of such ratings need to reconsider the same. The rooms (in my case Room 213) are very tired, smelly carpeting, worn room furnishings and attire, chipped and scratched closets made of cheap veneer to linen that does not smell fresh with a slight idiot to the towels. I spent about 100 days a year globally in five star luxury hotels and this does not remotely meet the bill. The TV was the size of a monitor and even Channels like BBC 1 and BBC World news did not work without substantial disturbance to where one could not watch and CNN and many others were not available and the TV was not set up properly. The bathroom glass shelves were dusty and the large shower head had calcium deposits on it. It is summer and pulled out the ironing board to decrease a linen shirt and found the iron neither worked or held water as when you poured in came out of the borrow of the iron. The breakfast room is on mezzanine level with no natural light and low ceilings, poor furniture and dishes/cutlery, far from the claimed five star standard. The carpet in the hallways smell and the decor is shabby modern with odd purples. The gym is an embarrassment for a five star. Paid a eye watering room rate and informed my business host to never book this hotel again as in Dublin eight times a year. The redeeming factor and the only one is the charm and friendliness of the staff and Irish charm and welcoming ways that kept me from checking out (another colleague did ) but best to choose from the many alternatives around the corner.",1,2022,06,25
204,Refuse to be put on the 6th floor,"It is hard currently to get a room in Dublin with all the pent up demand for work and leisure travel. So rates in hotels have tripled - what should be a €200 mid week room rate is now €600 per night. Fair enough. But for that price I do not expect:
- to be in a room with the air con and heating units for the hotel on the roof directly over my head meaning non stop noise and vibration 24 hours a day 
- to be hearing loud banging and hammering on the roof through to 10pm at night
- to have scuffed, stained furniture and a hair dryer that doesn’t work
- to have so little sound proofing that when the person in the room next to me was showering, I thought there was a serious water leak in my bathroom
- the access to the sixth floor has been covered elsewhere - it is a long winding route including compulsory stairs and you lose any potential sense of being in a luxury hotel long before you hit the long, dark, dingy smelly hallway to your room. 
The staff do their best and are generally friendly and helpful but the basic infrastructure, noise proofing and fit out is so poor I fail to understand how it can be a five star. 
And yes, I did ask to move - the hotel was sold out both nights so not possible.",1,2022,06,22
204,A weekend Treat,"An OK hotel. Due to its on Main Street location and proximity to late bars/Luas and passing late night revellers, the external street noise is loud even with secondary glazing. The hotel is a little dated and most definitely Overpriced even taking into account its very central location. Was looking forward to the stay here but unfortunately it was disappointing and definitely not value for money. ",3,2022,06,20
204,Wonderful Hotel,This hotel is beautiful and has the friendliest staff. The location was very good as well. We were treated with two glasses of Prosecco upon our arrival and chocolates in the room each night. The room is very comfortable too. ,5,2022,06,18
204,Last night in Dublin.,This was an absolute fabulous stay. I wanted to be close to Grafton Street in my last day so as to get as much shopping done. The hotel was perfect for me. The toilets were superb and the room was very quiet.,5,2022,06,16
204,Amazing hotel in a great location!,"We stayed over Easter and it was perfect. It was full of surprises, which really made a great start to our break. We travelled with our 2 young children and arrived quite early not expecting to check in but was hoping to leave our bags at the hotel. Surprisingly our room was ready! Not only that, we were given a glass of Prosecco each and apple juice for the kids, as the friendly young man who checked us in walked us to our room. 

The room was perfect. It was the room right at the end of the corridor, facing the courtyard with a good size balcony. We were in the middle of the city so of course there was noise but it wasn't bad at all. The room felt really welcoming and comfortable. If I was to be very picky, I would say maybe the bathroom needed a bit of an upgrade (where the tiles were) and the side of the sofa bed looked a bit tatty. It really didn't affect our stay at all and there are so many amazing things about this hotel which more than make up for these minor issues.

After we checked in, we ventured out to explore the area and when we arrived back to our room, there was a tray of popcorn, sweets, chocolates and juice for the kids! This was such an amazing surprise and the kids were so excited to see this when we got back. 

The turn down service with a little box of chocolates in the evenings was also nice. Also, at breakfast, the kids got a goody bag each! The bags included crayons, sheets of activities and stickers. They got this every morning we were at the hotel. This seems quite trivial but it was a nice touch as we would normally have to bring activities with us - with the goody bags we didn't need to!

All the staff were super friendly and helpful. My son had a torch which needed batteries so I went to the reception to ask if they have a screwdriver I can borrow so I can open the torch to find out what batteries we needed to get. Not only did they do this, they also put in some batteries that they had, which instantly put a big smile on my son's face. 

In terms of location, the park across the road was very handy for the kids to run around and just be kids, especially on a city break. Having the shops and restaurants on the doorstep and the tram station right there was also great. 

We would definitely stay here again if we return to Dublin! Thank you for an amazing stay :)",5,2022,06,15
204,Perfect Location,"The location of this hotel cannot be beat. Directly across from St. Stephens Green and the top of Grafton Street. Walking distance to everywhere you could possibly want to go in Dublin. A nice hotel room nothing over the top or fancy but clean and spacious. We were early so could not check in but they stored our bags for us. If you do want a taxi be aware it is not just difficult but almost impossible to get one in front of the Fitzwilliam, they did try for us but with no success. We ended up walking down Grafton St. to the Westbury and got one there. Also on our last night there, there was some sort of party going on next door and the music and people were so loud we were unable to sleep, this did go on for quite some time, we were not very happy. That is not the Fitzwilliams fault since it was another establishment. Pricey yes but so is everything nowadays!",4,2022,06,15
204,Not 5 stars,They played loud club music out of their restaurant till 3am keeping everyone up. Called down for clarification at 1:30am and we were told it should of ended and would be done shortly - it continued for another 90 minutes. Room looked like what you’d expect from a holiday inn. Greeting staff were very friendly and were the only good part about the place. ,1,2022,06,13
204,Excellent Stay!,"My girlfriend and i came to Dublin to see 50 cent in the 3 arena and stayed in the fabulous Fitzwilliam where everyone was very polite and welcoming, especially sean behind the bar who made the stay even better than expected!",5,2022,06,13
204,Stay here you won’t regret it,"Lovely hotel, friend helpful staff, delicious breakfast and the most amazing location. 

You can easily access all that Dublin has to offer. Walking distance to great shopping, dining and bars. But once inside my room that felt a million miles away as I was just able to switch off and relax. I’ll definitely be back. 
",5,2022,06,11
204,Staff are amazing,"Great location but hotel needs upgrades. Prices are very high in Dublin right now and for us that made this hotel not good value. The linens are great but the mattress are too hard. There are very few plugs in room to charge your technology. If you get a courtyard facing room it is blissfully quiet! it is very clean, but just feels a bit tired….",3,2022,06,02
204,Extremely expensive - did not measure up,The hotel was very disappointing for the expensive nature of the stay. The location beside a tacky bar/restaurant business completely destroys its street appeal. The foyer lacks charm and does not invite you in to visit or linger. Room decor and bathroom fittings (including tiling and grout) were tired.,2,2022,06,01
204,Barely a 3 star let alone a 5 star.,"To be fair there was nothing else available in central Dublin so I was forced to pay the extortionate rates that this hotel was asking for a Friday and Saturday night. The staff can't be faulted but the place itself is in dire need of a refit. My room was tiny, dark, delapidated and tired with scuffed, stained  furniture and appliances straight out of the late 80s, early 90s when the hotel was built. After staying at the Radisson a few night before this was a huge huge letdown. Never again. 
",1,2022,05,31
204,Short stay in Central Dublin,One of the most pleasant hotels I have stayed in. From the moment I arrived staff were professional and polite. A very enjoyable experience.  Perfect location to stay in Dublin City centre.  I would highly recommend for business or pleasure. ,5,2022,05,30
204,"Great location, good food",The hotel is very conveniently located right across from St. Stephens and essentially at the top of Grafton St. The rooms are very clean and well appointed. The food from the kitchen is good and the breakfast buffet with made to order requests is reasonably priced. Be wary of placement on the sixth floor. There is no elevator to that floor and the rooms are very far removed from the rest of the hotel. I wish I had asked to be moved. There wasn’t another soul staying up there with me and it was isolated/creepy at night.,4,2022,05,27
204,Lovely Place in Perfect Location,"The people were delightful at this hotel and the location was really perfect on St. Stephen's Green. The rooms need to be upgraded very soon, though, and the air conditioning is rather loud so we couldn't keep it on at night or we'd not sleep. ",4,2022,05,24
204,Excellent with wonderful with amazing  staff,"Our experience was just amazing. The location of course is perfect but what made it for us was the staff, so accommodating & friendly while still knowing when to let us just chill.  The beds are amazing too. Will definitely be back again. ",5,2022,05,23
204,Great Place to Stay,This was a great place to stay. Hotel staff was great except the porter out last day what took over 30 minutes to get our car from there parking garage. But other than that the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is centrally located. Rooms are spacious and very nice. ,5,2022,05,20
204,Absolutely amazing,"this hotel is AMAZING and the staff is so attentive! Everyone was warm, friendly and inviting and I could not have had a more enjoyable  time! thank you very much to everyone at the Fitzwilliam for making my trip one to remember and for giving me the best first experience in belfast",5,2022,05,18
204,Service at its best,"When there are so many five star options in Dublin City centre, accommodation offerings must really rely on their unique personality to compete. For me, service was very much at the heart of this for the Fitzwilliam! Of course it has all of the excellent facilities you would expect from a hotel of this nature, however, it’s the warm welcome, professionalism and attentiveness of the team that truly makes staying in this hotel a wonderful experience. I did mean to post this review earlier but forgot, thank you for lovely stay!",5,2022,05,17
204,Dublin stay,"Overall we really enjoyed our  3 days at this hotel. Great location off Grafton St and within walking distance of Trinity College and other top spots. Superb food at all dining spots there.. Staff was friendly and helpful  Bed was a bit hard for my taste though.
",5,2022,05,17
204,Dublin stay 2022,"this hotel is AMAZING and the staff is extraordinary!  From the front desk staff to the concierge, and the restaurant staff- everyone was warm and inviting and I could not have had a better time!  thank you to everyone at the Fitzwilliam for making my trip one to remember and for giving me the best first experience in Dublin!",5,2022,05,08
204,Hit and Miss,"Hits - the staff ! So professional particularly the staff on breakfast service and on the concierge desk
- it was my 60th birthday and they gave us a complimentary glass of Prosecco and a fruit plate in the room - a lovely surprise
- Diptyque bathroom supplies - impressive!
- comfortable beds and quiet room

Misses
 - upon checking in we found the room had a broken bottle of water and water had flooded the desk and drawer. When I called reception to have the broken glass removed, my request wasn’t understood. Twice, I had staff bring up two bottles of replacement water. I just wanted the broken glass cleaned up and the wet desk contents removed and replaced. I was told housekeeping would attend to the wet desk but this never happened. One of the room service staff removed the broken glass but none of the shards on the floor were picked up.

- the room was in dire need of refreshment. It faced an ugly glass office block and the purple lounge cushions were faded and sun damaged. 

- there was no pen provided. Only a pencil which, on closer inspection, had been chewed as there were teeth marks on it. 

Good thing we were so busy sightseeing that these ‘misses’ weren’t overly deal breakers but they make the experience wholly NOT five star.",3,2022,05,08
204,"Good location, nowhere near 5 star","The rooms on the 4th floor are not five star. The lampshade above the bed was covered in dust, there was mould on the tiles in the shower, there were stains on the couches - the list goes on. The gym is also tiny, just a hotel room with some gym equipment in there. ",3,2022,05,07
204,Disappointed,The best part of the stay was the location. Rooms are outdated and in need of repair. Its not what you expect from a 5 star hotel. The bar was out of stock on many items. Be aware if the hotels cancellation policy before booking. My flight was canceled prior to my first night so we called the hotel to inform them we would be coming a day later but staying an additional day. Their policy is 24 hour notice which I understand but felt it wasn't a way to treat their guest by charging for the 1st night even though we weren't there. The manager would not even come out to speak with me. All information was relayed through the front desk. Pretty disappointing,2,2022,05,03
204,Disappointing,"Have stayed here many times over the years - but beware when choosing a room.  The more expensive rooms have less facilities- for example a Garden View Room has a Nespresso machine whereas a more expensive Deluxe Premium Room with view of St Stephen's Green (and trams), does not - only offering a meagre supply of instant coffee- which i never drink.  Very disappointing considering this is a birthday treat!  Let us hope there are no further disappointments in store.......",3,2022,04,28
204,Vastly overrated,"This is an expensive 5 star hotel in the centre of Dublin.  I have stayed in better 3-star establishments.  The room on the 6th floor (only 5 floors accessible by lift) was small, uncomfortably hot and shabby. The party walls were woefully thin resulting in being able to hear everything happening in the room next door.
on  a positive note the check-in experience was pleasant and breakfast was good but not a 5-star experience either.
If you are looking for 5-star go elsewhere.  My experience fell well short of it.",2,2022,04,28
204,WOW..THANK YOU,"Hello reservations & team.

My partner and I stayed in your hotel Easter Sunday and on March 11th. I want to take this opportunity to commend every member of staff on their professionalism and courteous manner. From the moment we walked into your hotel, the attentive staff made us feel very special. The hotel is immaculate and the service outstanding.

So thank you very much for making our stays in your beautiful hotel memories for us to smile about.

I worked in hotel reservations and understand that a lot of work goes into maintaining these high standards. Keep up the fantastic work and thank you again. 

Kind regards,

Denise Maher & Graham Nolan.",5,2022,04,21
204,Excellent service and great location!,"From the moment we checked in (with the very friendly and helpful Stephanie) for this 2 night stay we were treated in a way that was refreshing and uncommon these days.

The hotel is in a perfect location and because of the excellent service from all employees we’ll definitely be returning!",5,2022,04,17
204,Disappointing stay!,Stayed here for one night as a couple. The hotel is very central and ideal for a shopping trip to Dublin as the shops are right on the door step. I found the bedroom to be very small and the bathroom was a bit dated looking. There was no sense of luxury what so ever in the room. The bar was nice but lacked atmosphere. We didn’t eat here so can’t comment on the restaurant. I didn’t feel that this hotel offered a 5 star experience and have stayed in better 4 star hotels. I would not return.,3,2022,04,13
204,Best Hotel in Dublin,We have stayed at the Fitzwilliam at least 10 times over the years and have never been disappointed.  Everything about the hotel is 5 star and the staff are outstanding.  We will certainly return on our trip next spring. ,5,2022,04,12
204,Not even close to five star standards,"I will start with the one good thing I found about the hotel - the staff were very friendly and helpful. However, everything else leaves a lot to be desired - I have stayed in better 3-star hotels. In fact, I could have checked into a maldron or some other chain hotel in Dublin's city center and gotten better service and surroundings for half the price. The Fitzwilliam should be ashamed of how poor the standards of its room and food were.

For starters, room 429 (I stayed there on March 26th) is tiny and in INCREDIBLY shabby condition (see pictures). I was disgusted when I checked in. I know I could have complained at the time, but I was rushing to get ready for an event in the city that night and didn't have time to complain or go changing rooms. And quite frankly, the Fitzwilliam hotel should have known better than to put a guest in that room given its disgraceful condition - the furniture is marked and peeling, the carpet is stained and the curtains don't fit the window (meaning I was awake at 6.30am because there was light streaming into the room). The room was quiet (which I asked for) but that wasn't much good if I was awake at sunrise because a 5-star hotel couldn't find curtains to fit the window. The bathroom is basic at best and the shower is little more than a trickle (not to mention that it took so long to warm up, I was actually nearly finished showering).

I also ordered from room service. It took 20 minutes to get through to room service, and another 35 minutes for the chicken caeser salad to get to my room. When it did finally come, the food was inedible - dripping in dressing, soggy and tasted foul. This I did complain about, as I absolutely could not eat it, and staff removed the dish from my room and the bill. I had to eat on the go as I did not have time to eat properly after the delay in just getting a simple salad, so I did not bother with breakfast in the morning. 

I also booked a taxi with reception (in advance) for 6.50pm. Got my taxi at 7.07 and only because the concierge went out to flag one down (I was waiting in the lobby since 6.45). I don't know whether they forgot to order it or it didn't come, but either way someone should have looked into it when it wasn't there by 6.55. To be honest, this isn't a huge deal, but just an example of the polish and standards that were lacking at the Fitzwilliam. 

I would not stay here again even if someone paid me, nor would I reccommend it to anyone. The hotel is woefully in need of an overhaul to meet 5-star expectations. Either that or it needs to lower its rating to a 3-star because that's all it is at present (and even that is pushing it).",1,2022,04,10
204,Great Place to Stay,"Location was amazing, right in the heart of shopping and restaurants. Our room was very large and had all amenities including robes and slippers. Loved the nightly turn down service that came with chocolates. Also received a personalized welcome note with truffles. The staff was super friendly and food at the grill was great. ",5,2022,04,10
204,Could be better,"Handy localisation and really nice room with comfortable bed. I can't say anything wrong about staff too. Everybody so helpful, professional and kind. Food OK, but could be better for this price, and it's not about taste but just about menu (not too many options). Officially this a 5* hotel, but I could say this hotel is no more as 4*.",3,2022,04,09
204,"Fantastic hotel, great location and excellent customer service",We returned to the Fitzwilliam for a short break. It is our preferred choice of comparable 5 star hotels in Dublin and did not disappoint. The newly refurbished rooms are comfortable and stylish. Breakfasts use lovely  Irish produce.  The hotel location is excellent and we made use of St Stephen’s Green -opposite- and Merrion Square - nearby - for walks. The staff are so helpful and Sebastian went out of his way to ensure that our stay went smoothly.,5,2022,04,06
204,Fantastic hotel and location,"Had a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam.  First of all, the location is ideal.  Quick walk to all the major shopping and top restaurants, I shuttled back and forth to drop my bags from shopping.  Beautiful park (St Stephens Green) across the street.  Modern hotel but not minimalist, the room was very comfortable and easy for me to work in.  Fantastic breakfast, tried something different each day (Irish Breakfast, Omelette, Shashuka) and they were all so good I'm dying to go back just to have more.  Service was also efficient.  Nothing to complain about.",5,2022,04,05
204,Excellent hotel.,The staff were courteous and efficient. The rooms are clean and well laid out. The food was first class. Really convenient location for shopping and nightlife.  I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.,5,2022,04,03
204,Best in Dublin,"There is no place I’d rather stay in Dublin. Perfect 5 stars all the way! Best staff, food, location, room, bed, everything. Don’t miss their fantastic restaurants, tea time and spa. I don’t plan on staying anywhere else when I visit Dublin.",5,2022,04,03
204,Great Hotel,"Room was well equipped with everything  Hair dryer,  bathrobes, slippers,  trouser press. tea and coffee with complimentary bottle water daily's well. as a very well stocked bathroom toiletries .  Lovely complementary tray of fruit and chocolates were in the room upon arrival. Staff were great and very helpful. Our room was beautiful and so quiet ensuring a great nights sleep. Location was brilliant and would happily stay here again",5,2022,04,02
204,Needs to shape up further to get to 5 star,"Great welcome  at checking in but odd inconsistences in service especially at breakfast.
Paper napkins as the norm hardly 5 star in the restaurant and long waits for food ...poor
Staff traing in English an issue for some...
There's better for the price in Dublin",3,2022,03,29
204,First trip to Dublin,"I got very lucky! I had chosen the Fitzwilliam Hotel for its location and nice photos, but It turned out to be much more than that. My first visit to Dublin was made memorable by staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.

Super-clean, nice amenities in the room, but the most important part was the friendliness and helpfulness of the entire team at the Fitzwilliam. Smiles and nice manners everywhere.

I returned to my room, after being out for St Patrick's Day, and there were a couple of festive cupcakes waiting for me. I did not need the turndown service, but I still received the chocolates.

It will not be my last stay at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2022,03,27
204,Business stay in Dublin,"Just go there, all you need and want in a central location for your business meetings and city discovery! Friendly staff, quiet and comfortable rooms, fine breakfast and bar and meeting facilities plus a perfect location. ",5,2022,03,24
204,Trip away with my daughter,"Myself and my 6 year old stayed in the Fitzwilliam for her birthday. we had a wonderful experience. We were greeted with a beverage and the staff were so nice to my daughter. Ralph, who checked us in brought us to our room and on the way my daughter told him it was her birthday. A short while later Ralph knocked on the door with a tray of popcorn and loads of other goodies for her birthday. She felt so special and we were both chuffed. We had a wonderful day and night filled with memories and this was mostly due to the special stay in our hotel. Many Thanks to all the staff.",5,2022,03,22
204,"Excellent, as always","I love this hotel - I use it when in town for  the rugby.it is a real oasis of calm, with a fab location and great quality - faultless.
The staff are a delight and the freshly cooked breakfasts are excellent 
Definitely my Dublin hotel of choice ",5,2022,03,21
204,Wonderful Place to stay in Dublin!,We had the best time at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It's in a great location...easy walking to Grafton Street and St Stephens Park.  The staff were all lovely and very helpful to us during our visit.  Highly Recommend!,5,2022,03,21
204,Extra spend for extra special,"My partner and I booked to stay in the Fitzwilliam for one night to celebrate our recent anniversary. 
The price (double room with breakfast included)  was of a notable amount but was in line with that being charged by neighbouring hotels if not slightly more expensive as a result of its 5 star rating. The room itself was spacious, bright and comfortable. The bathroom facilities were a little outdated with the hot tap not working at the sink and the flush system appearing temperamental with significant noise from the pipes when it did work. 
The breakfast menu and buffet were without a doubt the best breakfast I have ever been offered whilst staying in a hotel or guesthouse. The freshly baked blueberry muffins and banana bread were sampled several times. 

All in all, if you have some extra money to spend and are celebrating an event or occasion. I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam hotel for a comfortable sleep, breakfast bliss and a quiet stroll in St Stephen’s green thereafter.",5,2022,03,17
204,A beautiful stay in Dublin,"Perfect location, quiet and comfortable. The views of the garden and park are superb. A very beautiful property with rooms to match. Will ABSOLUTELY stay here again and recommend to everyone that they stay here.",5,2022,03,15
204,Wish I was there,"This is a superb hotel in one of Dublins best areas. 
The Michelin Star recently awarded to The Glovers Alley restaurant will probably work against hotel customers as it will never be possible to get a booking on short notice. I think a few places should be kept for hotel residents & released at short notice if not taken up. ",5,2022,03,13
204,Exceeded expectations,Staff were wonderful. Room was beautiful - newly renovated to a really high standard. Room was spotless. Breakfast was delicious. Brilliant location. Will stay next time in Dublin City centre again. Highly recommend. ,5,2022,03,06
204,Not “super quiet”,"We stayed here on a Friday night in February 2022. When booking the hotel website stated that the garden view rooms were “super quiet” as they didn’t face into the street. This was exactly what we were looking for. 
Upon arrival we were required to pay up front in full as we were using a debit card which is fine but we were also required to pay a €100 deposit for incidentals something I have never had to do before. 
There is a bar right next to the hotel and once the music started it could be heard all along the corridor on our floor and more importantly in our room. I contacted reception  around 11pm to ask how long it would be going on for and was informed till 1am. We then asked to be moved room to a quieter part of the hotel and in fairness this was facilitated but it was almost midnight by the time we had done so. 
On check out we spoke with the manager on duty who informed us that they were aware of this as it was an ongoing issue that they were trying to deal with. Considering the hotel felt the need to charge us a €100 deposit they could themselves have been more honest at the time of booking and informed us of this ongoing issue that they were aware of and knew would impact our stay. 
All of the staff we dealt with were polite and professional and the room we stayed in initially was clean and comfortable but the issues mentioned above made it a disappointing  experience that we will not be repeating.",2,2022,02,28
204,Good Central Location,"Good value hotel in central location if you need a base for shopping, socializing or touring. Gorgeous modern bathrooms- showers are over bath. Smooth check in and check out with helpful staff. Parking on site. ",4,2022,02,28
204,"An incredible stay in a beautiful, centrally located hotel.","An incredible stay in a beautiful, centrally located hotel. With a most helpful and friendly staff. We will definitely return in the near future. The breakfast set us up for a busy day of sightseeing and shopping.",5,2022,02,27
204,One Night break,"Excellent hotel, very well located for the city centre, extremely nice and helpful staff.Rooms were very clean and recently refurbished to a very modern standard. The coimplimentary glass of prosecco on arrival was a nice touch. ",5,2022,02,22
204,The Best Hotel in Dublin,"Absolutely perfect Stay! From the first moment of arrival the receptionist staff are so friendly and welcoming. The staff are trained to such a high standard they are all a breath of fresh air. 

The rooms are great, all the staff are so friendly, the breakfast was excellent, we had afternoon tea the next day and it was beautiful. 

This hotel is worth every euro!",5,2022,02,21
204,Parking so convenient,"This is an excellent hotel.  Very welcoming and wonderful breakfast.  We were most comfortable here. Parking is so convenient, lift straight to Reception. It’s second car park, on the way in, Hotel name over park. ",5,2022,02,21
204,1 night city break,"Lovely hotel very attentive staff, excellent location. Check in was excellent parked the car luggage to our room zero hassle. breakfast was nice, overall a very enjoyable stay. would definitely stay again.",5,2022,02,20
204,As close to the centre of the city as you'd want,"The hotel is in a great location for the city centre with a great carpark and free charging for electric vehicles..  We booked a Deluxe room and it has to be said the rooms to the front of the hotel have a lovely view of the Green.  

With that said, there is a club next door and even on the top floor, the thud from the bass can be felt and heard.  Be forewarned.  We requested a change and were relocated to a smaller room overlooking their garden.  This room was a lot nicer in fit and finish with clever digital controls for lighting.

Having seen both, the Deluxe is showing its age now and tatty.  Refurbed rooms are compact but very well appointed and comfortable.  In-room TV is big and clear but a poor selection of channels and no smart options are made available - an important feature for business travellers. Bathroom excellent with separate bath and shower option.

Dined in Glovers Alley - see separate review - and had breakfast the next morning.  Breakfast options are very good with great cooked breakfast options with a nice selection of cold meats, pastries and cereals.  Fruit options limited.

Staff are super helpful and a credit to the property.

(there was one major issue with the property however that pains me to mention but in the lobby, there was a horrendous smell of sewage  from most likely a blocked drain.  Thankfully it was absent from the rooms, the bar and other dining areas.)",4,2022,02,14
204,Romantic night away,We stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a romantic night away on the Saturday before Valentine's day.  From my initial contact with the hotel before our arrival and throughout our stay our experience was excellent.,5,2022,02,14
204,Beautiful Rooms,"Located at the top of Grafton Street . Super location for shopping. The rooms were beautiful. Reception and check in perfect . A lovely girl from Belgium checked me in, training and learning english . Best of luck to her, it’s not easy in a foreign country - i’m sure she’ll do great. Beautiful rooms, Very clean , everything you need for a night in Dublin . I was in and out to the airport and just wanted a browse around shops to waste time . Check out at 12 perfect for that . ( i couldn’t get the hot water to work in the shower - but i’m sure that was just me ) . Would definitely stay again . Didn’t have time to try the restaurant or bar. Next time will do that .",5,2022,02,08
204,Amazing trip,"Highly recommend.  Excellent location.  Friendly staff and very helpful without any effort.  Bedrooms absolutely sound, cleanliness, comfort and relaxing.  Breakfast/food excellent.  A hidden gem located Dublin central. ",5,2022,02,02
204,Excellent city centre hotel,"Excellent hotel. Perfect service. Restaurant superb. Great cocktails. Concierge great,will take in shopping bags! The barfoid is of a surprisingly poor standard with chaotic service. Avoid. Everything else 5 star!",4,2022,01,25
204,Great staff,"We stay here whenever we are in Dublin. The location is brilliant, close to shops restaurants and pubs but far enough away to be peaceful and quiet. The breakfast is freshly cooked to order with something on there for everyone. We will definitely be back.",5,2022,01,17
204,Ideal hotel in Dublin,"The location is fantastic- central to shops, restaurants and museums. The rooms were comfortable and silent. The warm fire greeting us on arrival in the lobby was  perfect. The staff were helpful and attentive - a great place to stay in Dublin",5,2022,01,09
204,Disappointing!,"Looks a lot better on the website. Room was small, bathroom was in need of updating and the cost of the stay was vastly overpriced for what you get. Location was perfect in the heart of Dublin. Would not book again",3,2022,01,09
204,Great location,We spent two nights in the Fitzwilliam over the Christmas break. Fantastic location in the centre of Dublin. We had a lovely refurbished room which is done to a very high standard although we found the room to be extremely warm at night time. The breakfast and the service at breakfast was excellent. Service in the bar at times was not up to the level required for a five star hotel.  Generally it was an enjoyable stay and any issues were dealt with professionally by the Reservations Manager. In our opinion the lobby area is under utilised and the layout restricts the number of people that can sit comfortably in the area. From previous years the lobby was more vibrant. Hopefully they will continue the refurbishment of the other rooms and public areas/lobby.,4,2021,12,29
204,Lovely Stay,Excellent hotel in an excellent location. Would highly recommend it to anyone. Very friendly and helpful staff. Its close proximity to St Stephens Green and Grafton St make it an ideal place to cater all needs.,5,2021,12,29
204,A really pleasant stay! Looking forward to returning.,"We stayed here mid-December and the staff were absolutely lovely! We were checked-in very efficiently by the Receptionist (Amy) who showed us to our room which was a lovely touch. The room was spotless and even had Barry's tea bags - that's always a major plus for me! All the staff we encountered were really lovely (reception, concierge, room service and breakfast) - so welcoming and couldn't do enough for us. However, Amy was the star for us - she was extra nice to our young son which was lovely. The hotel is in a super location for shopping on Grafton Street. When we were checking out, we booked another stay for the end of December which we are looking forward to.",5,2021,12,28
204,Fabulous stay,Myself and my  husband have been staying at this hotel for over fourteen years and we love it it’s a beautiful hotel rooms are 5 star staff are amazing food is delicious hope to be going again soon well done,5,2021,12,23
204,Feels like they've let maintenance slide,"We've previously stayed at the Fitzwilliam and our stay was excellent (2 years ago). This year, first they gave our room to a travel companion (ours was an upgrade compared to theirs), next we had a leak in the room. Maintenance theoretically looked at it, but then it leaked again with the next shower (sopping wet carpet), which then started to smell moldy. Then we were offered maintenance again (what's the point?), so I requested a new room.  Which they did give us, but it was a downgrade compared to the previous room.  The front desk staff were nice, but didn't always seem to know what to do.  Throw in a couple of days with no hot water.... not the best.",2,2021,12,22
204,Exceptional service,"I stayed here for work for 3 nights in mid September and again at the beginning of December.

Truly attentive, genuine and hospitable team.

A huge shout out to Kimberly on reception and Alejandro in Food & Beverage, both of whom remembered me immediately from my stay 3 months ago.

I was truly amazed and touched they both remembered me and made me feel so at home - I hope they will be recognised and rewarded for their service excellence.

Will always book the Fitzwilliam in Dublin based on their warm hospitality.

Thanks again and see you Feb/Mar 2022 - pending any travel restrictions.",5,2021,12,22

204,A gem in the middle of a busy city,"Great location if you want to explore Dublin, hotel is clean , beds comfortable and food is nice .the only downside is the parking. But if you are not driving public transport very accessible and the hotel is a walking distance to everywhere. ",5,2021,12,19
204,Family break,"Stayed for 1 night. Amazing location so convenient 
Staff very friendly, especially Sebastian in concierge team. Parking ok very limit space even as we arrived early as advised. Advised no valet parking but as we parked observed other cars being valet parked found this odd and a not the best service.
Hotel: public areas , bar great , food top notch
Room was ok , premium room but no extras as advertised but room very comfortable, great view of st Stephen green. Only negatives on room poor socket layout (only one near bed) furniture bit dirty ( stains on chairs room 408)
Overall kid friendly, good location, food and drinks amazing 
Would definitely return",4,2021,12,18

204,Great location in a great city,"The Fitzwilliam is in the best location in the city, everything I needed was only 10 minutes walk away but it is the friendly staff that stood out with genuine hospitality from the moment i walked in. The room I stayed in was brilliant, looked very fresh and modern with views over St Stephen's Green, all the furnishings were of the highest quality and nice touches like water in the room.
Another bonus of this hotel is having the Glover's Alley restaurant in the hotel, without doubt some of the best food and service I have experienced.",5,2021,12,06
204,"Fab hotel, top class staff in great location","Fabulous hotel in perfect location. Staff and service exceeded expectations. Special mention to Stephanie at check in was so professional and friendly and nice touch by walking us to our hotel room. She noticed it was my birthday and presented us both with glass of Prosecco. Room was small but lovely. Spotlessly clean. Another advantage is parking at hotel, great perk! Breakfast lovely, was nice to see different options on menu. Great value for money also. Only downside is we didn’t stay sooner. Can’t wait to go back.",5,2021,12,04
204,Great stay at Fitzwilliam Hotel,Fabulous stay at fitzwilliam hotel - ideally located - friendly helpful and thoroughly fabulous staff from desk to breakfast staff - they couldn’t  be nicer - hotel itself ideal - rooms spotless - will definitely stay here again ! ,5,2021,12,03

204,Great hotel,"Had a lovely visit. Room was beautiful, breakfast was great, staff were lovely. Only minor quibble was a lack of places other than the bar to sit around in the evening. The lobby (other than the library area, which was lovely) is very public.",5,2021,12,01
204,Location and service,A superb centrally located hotel on St Stephen's Green. Excellent ambience with staff who are both friendly and helpful which enhances the customer experience. Highly recommended for that special break.,4,2021,11,28
204,Afternoon Tea,"We enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Restaurant yesterday afternoon. The service was excellent, very attentive and prompt. To our delight, the hotel chef surprised us with a birthday cake, such a wonderful and unexpected gesture.

204,Mrs V.. Hassett,"enjoyed my short stay and would recommend the hotel to friends. Heating a little too high in bedroom.
car park access was well described on your web site.
Breakfast was superb
Staff extremely helpful every where in the Hotel",5,2021,11,28
204,5 star?,"We stayed on the fifth floor at the end of a very long and dark corridor.

The room and bedclothes were clean but the furniture had seen better days.
The bathroom was shabby (on the plus side the water pressure in the shower was super).
The curtains in the room did not close properly.
The air conditioning did not work and as a result the room was just too warm.

The Fitzwilliam is in a really great location but I have to wonder is it really a five star hotel.If someone had told me it was a four star I’d have agreed.",3,2021,11,28
204,Excellent Property in the heart of a vibrant Dublin City,"Top Hotel at the Top of Grafton Street. Beautiful rooms, friendy, professional, unobtrusive staff and one of the very best breakfasts in any Hotel. We felt very safe at all times thanks to the wonderul caring staff. The level of hygiene is our room when we checked in was of a really high standard and nothing was left to chance.

Check in and out was very efficient and friendly. I would highly recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2021,11,27

204,"Exceeded our expectations! Felt like a ""home away from home""","My husband, son and I recently stayed at the FitzWilliam hotel while in Dublin to visit our daughter in college, and the entire experience exceeded our expectations! The courtesy of everyone on the staff, the readiness to assist in any way, no question was regarded as ""too much"", and I felt they were always eager to help. We stayed for 8 nights and it was so nice while being far from home to feel like we had a safe, comfortable place to stay. The bed was so comfortable, the shower was amazing, the view of St Stephens Green right across the street, the easy location to Grafton Street and easy access to all the restaurants, pubs, sights and shopping of Dublin, parking on site (for a reasonable fee)...I can't say enough about our experience.  I'd definitely stay here again and highly recommend to anyone else! ",5,2021,11,26
204,Very disappointing,"My third time to stay at the hotel and unfortunately will be my last. Firstly the location of the hotel is great and staff are very helpful. Our room on the 5th floor however was not even 3 star. The air conditioning did not work at all and the room was extremely dated. The curtains could not close fully to keep out the light, there was about a foot between them when closed. Furniture was worn and marked and there was a machine making a humming noise outside our window. Very disappointed especially considering it's a five star and the price.",2,2021,11,22
204,The right choice: excellent hotel from all points of view,"high quality hotel in a very comfortable and strategic location
top service and personnel efficient and competent
design extremely accurate with elegant colors and excellent materials
the care in the details make the difference",5,2021,11,22
204,"Excellent service and location, room improvements needed",Service (concierge particularly helpful) and location (overlooks St Stephens Green Park and steps from Grafton St) were outstanding. Rooms felt outdated and were not as luxurious as the price would imply. Good choice if you care about location and good service.,4,2021,11,15
204,2 night stay,Excellent staff very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location right beside a luas stop and Grafton street. The room was nice views over St Stephen green. Bar in hotel has the best staff food and cocktails excellent ,5,2021,11,10
204,Amazing stay at the FitzWilliam in Dublin!,"Just got back from an amazing stay at the FitzWilliam in Dublin!  It was my first time there (normally stay at the Shelbourne) but I will definitely be back!  The staff are what made this trip so good.  Sebastien and Ellen at check in were able to get us in a little early and explained all we needed to know about the hotel, COVID rules, and reservations for breakfast.  The property is very centrally located on St. Stephen's Green at the top of Grafton Street but was surprisingly quiet once inside.  Furnishings were nice and plush and the beds were perfect for a good nights rest.  The breakfast was wonderful each day and very plentiful and tasty.  But the person who made our stay most memorable was Marcin, the Head Concierge.  He provided amazing insight into day trips from Dublin, restaurant, spa, and shopping recommendations.  He was a font of information and I wish we could clone him!   This hotel really made you feel like they valued your being there and treated you like family.  I can't recommend it enough!!   ",5,2021,11,05
204,Wonderful place to stay!,"Great hotel, with a wonderful bar and amazing amenities. Right in the heart of Dublin, close to historic bars and great shopping.

204,"Excellent Hotel,Staff,Location","Stayed for 3 nights and had a very pleasant experience from start to finish.
Staff friendly and helpful and location of the hotel was perfect.
Breakfast and Glovers Alley restaurant were exceptional.
Only negative point was that the water in the room was not renewed.
",5,2021,10,28
204,Very poor experience,"Small shabby room which didn’t feel clean, not worth the money.  Room service was a shambles breakfast order didn’t arrive, needed to be reordered. Breakfast mediocre when it arrived late.  Bad value for money.",1,2021,10,28

204,Business Trip,"Lovely refined elegant hotel with excellent location and attentive friendly service. 
I had an excellent stay. The check-in was smooth, the receptionist was very attentive and professional but warm and friendly at the time.  The concierge was happy to help with various questions and request for taxi. The location is ultra convenient next to St Stephen's Green and therefore quiet at night but central at the same time. ",5,2021,10,25
204,"Great sports bar, great staff - amazing music!",Despite ‘Covid Times’ bar was atmospheric. Covid passes checked on door. Staff were very attentive & friendly. Great pub to watch Liverpool smash MAN U 5-0 ! Pizza & chicken wings were amazing - as was the Guinness! Live music was excellent however slightly spoiled by the ‘Instagram’ generation crowding her stage and overshadowing her wonderful voice and performance.,5,2021,10,25
204,A Perfect Stay,"We recently visited while celebrating a wedding anniversary and can not say enough good things about our recent stay. The location is perfect for exploring the city, finding a nearby pub or restaurant or seeking quiet in St. Stephens Square directly across the street.  The room was great - well maintained, clean and quiet. Breakfast was amazing, from the choices, to the food, to the staff each morning. While the hotel itself is wonderful, the staff truly shines. From Kimberly at the front desk to Fergal, the General Manager, they were all friendly, welcoming and helpful. I'll be visiting Dublin again in the near future and honestly wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.",5,2021,10,19
204,Great Dublin Weekend,"Fantastic location, friendly staff. Great amenities. Clean, beautiful room. What more could you ask for? Staff went out of their way to be helpful. Covid safety measures in place made everyone feel very comfortable. All in all, a very positive experience",5,2021,10,17
204,Excellent Location and a friendly staff,I booked a room for two nights at the Fitzwilliam after a friend described it as the friendliest hotel in Dublin.  I was not disappointed.  The staff was warm and welcoming. The location of the hotel cannot be beaten. It is across from St. Stephen's Green and a very short walk to Grafton Street. Trinity College and the Book of Kells are just a short stroll down Grafton Street.  The room was relatively large and the bathroom was excellently laid out. I couldn't have asked for a nicer stay.,5,2021,10,14
204,Good location and a nice hotel,Good location and central for most of Dublin. Nice decor and friendly staff. We last visited here 9 years ago and it's not really changed much during this time. One way system takes a lot longer to get to hotel by taxi. ,3,2021,10,11
204,Highly recommend,"The location and service in the hotel is absolutely 5 star. The room was small but very clean. 

We where put into a room looking at the side of an office block when we could have had a lovely view looking over St
 Stephens Green. The hotel was not busy and think this was a missed opportunity to encourage guests to return and upgrade.

The food and cocktails fabulous. All the staff where friendly and very attentive could not fault them.",4,2021,10,09
204,A taste of luxury in the heart of our great city,"Had a day out in our own town. Got a few bits and pieces, lunch and then dinner and overnight in this lovely hotel. Food superb, ample rooms, and very peaceful despite being beside the Luas. For staycaters and international guests it is an ideal location for shopping in Grafton St., Stephen’s Green, and Trinity college. A dart ride to Dundrum or on the other side to Dublin North. Almost everything near by.  
Fergal, the General Manager, a delight to meet. Lovely friendly staff too and coping expertly with Covid.",5,2021,10,06
204,City Break,"A really enjoyable experience staying at The Fitzwilliam, we will definitely return. It is the little things that make the difference, your staff are excellent and a pleasure to interact with . Amy who checked us in and brought us to our room was brilliant and a great asset to your business. We had a number of interactions with your staff during our stay and at each contact point they were excellent. Volcan who delivered our breakfast to our room and Robbie from the bar were excellent also. Keep up the good work ! You have a winning formula !",5,2021,10,04

204,"Professional Staff. You're paying for location, location, location. The room could have been bigger (the standard room).",Professional Staff. Standard room not that large- but it is the heart of downtown Dublin - the full-size couch in the room was a nice touch. Good sized bathroom and excellent quality breakfast. I recommend this hotel. ,5,2021,09,30
204,Outstanding hospitality and wonderful nine day stay,"My husband and I have traveled to Dublin before and stayed at the lovely hotels, Westbury and Shelbourne there.  This trip we were staying for nine days and wanted a more boutique, personalized experience so after much research and hearing respected recommendations, we chose The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin.  We couldn't have been more delighted!  It was our best hotel choice yet with truly over-the-top hospitality; spacious, modern and quiet room; all in a superb location.  We'd give it eight stars if we could:) ",5,2021,09,28
204,Excellent Hotel,"My family and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin to celebrate my son's birthday. I can say that we had an excellent experience.
We were well looked after from the beginning to the end of our stay.
All staff are attentive and are always on hand to help.
Check in was super fast and the gentleman who attended us was super attentive.
When we got to the room, we had a big surprise since they knew it was my son's birthday, we were welcomed with some delicious gifts. We love it.
Room service is to be congratulated.
And the breakfast service was very special.
In particular, we want to thank Carolina and  Amanda who served us very well during breakfast. They made us feel at home. The breakfast is amazing, delicious.
Finally, thanks to everyone at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin, you made my son's birthday and our stay special. When we return to Dublin, this will be the Hotel that we will stay again and that we recommend to all our friends.",5,2021,09,23
204,A very positive experience,"Convenient on St Stephen’s Green for easy walking to shopping, bars, and sights.  A wonderful base for a visit to Dublin.  European sized but very comfortable room.  Attentive staff.  Well worth a return visit.",4,2021,09,21
204,A superbly run hotel,"Highly positive. Practical, sober and highly efficient throughout. Central location and vicinity to RCSI provide added value. The room was very comfortable and had all we needed. We were all right with the bath, but someone with mobility restrictions might experience problems. Breakfast was the best we ever had, and we are very experienced travellers. Everybody was very polite, helpful and efficient. Could not ask for more.",5,2021,09,20
204,Fabulous,Had an amazing stay. Friendly and attentive staff. The room was very clean and the hotel felt very clean and safe. The location was excellent - walking distance from everywhere. Would highly recommend this hotel. ,5,2021,09,13
204,Great hotel,"Lovely staff, everyone very friendly and helpful, couldn’t do enough for you from front desk to concierge. 
The breakfast is amazing, the best hotel breakfast ever. 
Rooms small but very clean and tidy. Overall a great experience. ",5,2021,09,13
204,"We had a very enjoyable stay, we will be back","We had a very enjoyable stay, we will be back. The meal in the Grover alley restaurant was fantastic, the food was excellent, the best meal we have ever had. The room was lovely and the hotel is very central location on Stephen’s green",5,2021,09,12
204,If only all City hotels were like this,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is one of the best that we have stayed in. It's understated but elegant and the location on St Stephen's Green is hard to beat. Rooms are well equipped and beds so comfortable. The attention to the smallest detail is quite   something.

We did not eat evening meals in the restaurant but the breakfast was very good, with an excellent range of freshly cooked food. 

Best of all, the staff were quite superb. Everyone that we encountered was helpful and friendly, while never intrusive. From reception on check in to the barman in the evening, they all helped create a memorable trip. If only all hotels were like this...",5,2021,09,09
204,Across the board fantastic - happily and highly recommend - Gold standard . .,"This is  GOLD STANDARD  , the moment we arrived and the concierge parking the car and the huge welcome from Cormac The Manager to welcome us back once again  and Stephanie in reception .  We were allocated a fabulous room with free standing bath overlooking the green with a fabulous surprise awaiting us - THANK YOU  .   We went to the bar for a snack and it was great to see the warm friendly and efficient Luke there ,  We asked Luke to reserve the table in front of the tv for drinks later and to watch the football and needless to say it was there waiting for us at 7.30 . We went to Glover's Alley to eat later and like usual we highly recommend this dining experience .  Breakfast was the traditional service  which we love served by friendly efficient staff . 
  Overall  the staff across the board are warm , friendly and efficient  and every effort is made by them to make your stay one to remember .  Thank you Cormac , Stephanie and Luke to name just a few  - great ambassadors for the Hotel Industry . We will be back again to celebrate my birthday  on September the 11th and where better to celebrate but here and be treated like Royalty once again !!",5,2021,08,30
204,Great stay in the heart of Dublin,"We had a fantastic stay in the hotel with beautiful views over the St. Stephens Green Park. The staff were excellent and attentive in every way and it didn’t disappoint. The only areas of improvement I would like to see would be; 

- the coffee in the breakfast area, filter coffee in a high class hotel shouldn’t be served in my opinion and I would love to see them support some local coffee roasters, rather than the mainstream businesses. 
- the room we were in was the corner suite and the vents on the balcony were so noisy and smelt of grease. A glass fence/shield might be appropriate to reduce the noise (but keep the views), nothing can be done about the smell which is understandable. 

Overall, an excellent stay and couldn’t really ask for much more from a city centre hotel. Would highly recommend to family and friends wanting to stay in Dublin",5,2021,08,30
204,Beyond Everything,"We had an exceptional experience at The Fitzwilliam Hotel and apologies I am only getting round the writing a review now. 

From the moment we arrived our experience was exceptional, checkin was welcoming and the champagne added to the experience. We were upgraded to a suite and the room was well equipped and spacious for Dublin. The balcony was such a lovely feature. I particularly enjoyed the truffles left in the room. Thank you. 

Dinner in Glovers Alley was a special experience. The food was superb. Lastly, thank you to team on the front desk who kindly organised breakfast on the balcony overlooking the green. It was such a special experience. 

I can’t recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel enough. Thank you Sabastian for making our trip away so special",5,2021,08,29
204,The best vacation ever,"From the time arrived at the Fitzwilliam, they anticipated our every need.  Our plane was seriously delayed and we were exhausted.  They had our room ready, made check in easy, and sent pastry’s to our room since we had missed breakfast.  Very thoughtful!",5,2021,08,28
204,Relaxed stay,"Thank you to all the staff for a most enjoyable stay.  Reception were very warm and welcoming.  We enjoyed dinner in the Bar on Monday night and again found the staff very attentive to all guests. 
The accommodation staff were excellent, kind and courteous.   Definitely looking forward to my return stay already!",5,2021,08,25
204,No value for money,"Wasn’t overly impressed with the experience and didn’t didn’t find it value for money … 

The tidiness of the room was ok furniture was dated and old as well stains on the wooden tops just didn’t feel it was worth €479 for one night ",2,2021,08,23
204,Excellent luxurious hotel and central location,"This was our first holiday since March 2020. Sebastian - Deputy Manager-  and Sarah - front desk- were so attentive to our needs. The room was fantastic. Despite the central location, there was no street noise. The breakfast was wonderful. Having stayed in a number of luxury Dublin hotels, this is easily the best.",5,2021,08,22
204,Good service -- but not good value.  Infrastructure Issues exist,"We decid stay here for a few nights in August after seeing the positive reviews on Trip Advisor.   But it was a decidely mixed experience. A great location, across the street from St. Stephens green (a great walking park) and near excellent shopping, pubs and nightlife.  Tram stop right in front of hotel.   The staff is also quite good.  I would give them a 4 out of 5 on service.  It wasn't like the Park House Hotel in Galway (see my other review), but still pretty good.  Rooms are on the smallish side and there are some oddities.  For example, the water in our shower was lukewarm at best.  They couldn't fix it.   Other guests had the same issue. There is only 1 restaurant that belongs to the hotel and its pretty pedestrian .  The lounge is also pretty plain.  There is a restaurant called Glovers Alley (a michelin star) on the 1rst floor but it's not part of the hotel and its very expensive.  There isn't enough staff in the hotel.  When we arrived, there were no porters available and the ladies at the front desk brought our luggage inside.   The feel of the hotel isn't really 5 star.  It's more like a functional Westin Hotel that is a bit dated.   It's definitely not worth $300 per night.  So my suggestion is this.  Spend another $50 dollars per night and stay at another 5 star like the Conrad or the Merion or if you really have some money go to the Shelbourne.  Alternately, I'd spend $200 per night and stay at a 4 star hotel.  At least you can save some money and go to a nice restaurant every night.  ",3,2021,08,22
204,Superb,Could not recommend the hotel highly enough. Great location beside St Stephens Green. Our third time to stay with the Glovers Alley dine and stay package. The food in Glovers Alley was fantastic. Will be going back again. ,5,2021,08,22
204,Wonderful end to my first visit to Ireland,"I had taken a 7 night tour of Ireland and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam at the end so I could take my COVID test to return home.  It was an easy walk to the testing center.  What I didn’t expect was the amazing service I received.  From the check in where I was helped up to my room, to the service in the bar with early dinner and then helping me have some last minute laundry done so I could fly home comfortably.  I’m a senior and I was treated with such kindness. Also, on my tour, being a solo traveler, I often was put in interesting rooms.  Fun, but for my last three nights at the Fitzwilliam, pure indulgence.

Thank you so much for making my first trip to Ireland so memorable.  ",5,2021,08,21
204,City Break,"Excellent central location. Very friendly and attentive staff.  Great atmosphere, excellent COVID protocol. We had standard room, which was very comfortable. Excellent breakfast. Would highly recommend this hotel, we would stay here again .",5,2021,08,21
204,Not value for money,"Pros: The hotel is modern with bold colors and great location. Decent service but not a great problem solving staff.
Cons: Very small space, Lukewarm shower, understaffed and a mediocre breakfast. Definitely not value for money.",3,2021,08,18
204,Fabulous central Dublin hotel,"Location is perfect and the staff is perfect,too . We had a terrace bedroom on the 5th floor overlooking St Stephens Green which we really enjoyed.There is a lovely bar in the hotel which has a great drinks menu and a very extensive bar food menu",5,2021,08,18
204,Night out,Myself and my partner booked this hotel for a night away and we had such a lovely time the hotel was lovely but it was the staff that made the experience all the better they couldn’t do enough for you ,5,2021,08,17
204,Post C19 Travels,"It was nice to get away after a hectic few months and visit family, the hotel was well kept but seems critically low on staff. Reception staff in heels and skirts helping to carry luggage and gear for guests is not a good look for the establishment (or the guests who allow them to do it). Being a casual golfer myself, those bags can easily weigh +35lb. 

The staff was very nice in general and seemed to be trying their best but seemed quite stressed and stretched which is understandable. The -2 stars is for the management. 

John",3,2021,08,17
204,City Centre stay for a wedding,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam as we were attending a wedding in the city centre. We are from Dublin and would not normally stay at a hotel in the capital, but we will be back to the Fitzwilliam.
The staff were excellent, I can say no more. The room was beautiful, well decorated and had everything we needed for a lovely stay. A point of note is a proper sized bath, excellent. The attention to detail in the ensuite was especially good.
The breakfast was lovely and all in all we had a fantastic stay. The room was very very quiet, temperature controls were precise (and quiet), the blinds were blackout and the bed was excellent so a great nights sleep was had. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Dublin.",5,2021,08,16
204,All good..:),"We enjoyed our stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The staff were friendly and helpful, the food was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. 
If I have a fault to mention it would be the bed.  Too hard for my bones.
But apart from that I will most certainly return to this hotel.  ",5,2021,08,15
204,Brilliant stay,"Service brilliant, location perfect, food spot on. Couldn’t ask for a better stay in Dublin.  Newly refurbished rooms lovely and air conditioning was great. Food was lovely in Inn on the Green.  Will definitely be returning. ",5,2021,08,14
204,Great location,"Stayed here on an overnight break with friend . Hotel room small but very clean , beds very comfortable and room had all the extras . Staff are incredibly helpful and friendly here and service is wonderful. Breakfast was great and they have a great selection on the menu .  Great location and parked in hotel carpark .So close to grafton St shopping and restaurants.  Really enjoyed our brief stay",5,2021,08,13
204,Great Hotel with amazing Staff,"I stayed here with my 10 year old daughter and the staff were amazing and made her feel so special , It is a long time since I have stayed at a hotel with such personable service.....thank you we will definitely be back again, ",5,2021,08,11
204,Fantastic Fitzwilliam,"First class service 
Wonderful breakfast 
Spotless room 
Unbeatable location 
Can’t wait to get back
Fantastic weekend in Dublin, the hotel  is so central , staff were very friendly, food & cocktails were top quality",5,2021,08,09
204,Great hotel experience,"Highly recommend this hotel. I could not fault any part of the experience, the staff were lovely and extremely attentive, the room was perfect with a great view, and the location is ideal. It was great to easily come back to the hotel after being out shopping for a few hours, it's right off Grafton Street. I will definitely be staying here again.",5,2021,08,08
204,Lovely hotel with fantastic staff.,"Great location - lovely food and really great friendly and helpful staff. The cocktails in the bar are amazing - the staff are so knowledgeable. 
Breakfast was fabulous - we had room service and really enjoyed it. ",5,2021,08,08
204,5 Star Hotel,"The hotel has an excellent location for shopping. From the moment we checked in, until we checked out, we had a splendid time in the hotel. All the staff were very friendly and the food was superb. We look forward to returning.",5,2021,08,07
204,Why I like The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is an excellent hotel in an central location in Dublin ideal for visiting main art galleries and museums. There are a lot of first-class restaurants within comfortable walking distance of the hotel. The people who work in the hotel are friendly, natural and helpfulHE fITZWILLIAM hOTEL.  ",5,2021,08,07
204,Satisfied stay in Dublin,Our experience at the hotel was very pleasant and enjoyable from the minute we arrived. The hotel is very central and the staff very friendly. We really enjoyed the breakfast experience and will definitely be coming back,5,2021,08,07
204,Short stay in Dublin,"Had a lovely stay, great place well appointed and in the centre of Dublin. It was my first stay in the Fitzwilliam but I don't think it will be my last all in all great people great place, see you soon.",5,2021,08,07
204,Dublin trip,"Great location great service great staff and great food. This hotel is deceptive from the outside but delivers once you are inside. Location is perfect for restaurants, museums, sight seeing and anything else you want to do in Dublin",5,2021,08,06
204,Brilliant Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights on a B and B plus dinner package. We had already booked another hotel in Dublin but toook a punt on changing when we saw a €200 euro differential between both places. The Fitzwilliam also offered free parking as part of this package which would have cost us €50 euro in the other hotel. Its entrality was another factor. You are on the Grafton Street side of St. Stephen's Green with all the shops, bars and restaurants at your beck.
We were met with a couple of glasses of prosecco on arrival as it was our anniversary and our room was upgraded so this was a great start. The room was very contemorary and plush with plenty of room. 
Dinner as part of the package was excellent. Really good food, well presented. The barman was charm personified. He was genuinely knowledgable for such a young man. He came accross as a professional barman as opposed to a young lad who happened to be working in a bar. 
In fact what made this stay stand out from other 5 star stays we had was that everything was about the guests. I have stayed in other 5 star hotels where it was more about the hotel than the guest. This was by far the friendliest hotel that I have stayed in. I cannot reccomend it highly enough.",5,2021,08,05
204,Peace and Quiet in the middle of the city.,"We are just back from 2 nights stay and it was fabulous. It was the quietest room we have ever stayed in! There is sound proofing over the windows and you literally can’t hear anything outside especially not the seagulls! The room was spacious, beautifully redecorated and overlooking Stephens green. Lovely welcome hamper and Prosecco on  arrival as we were staying for our honeymoon. The hotel is so central easy to get to or plan your days from. Breakfast was really good and the cocktails were amazing. 
All staff members were so friendly, professional and respectful. Can’t recommend enough and will absolutely be back.",5,2021,08,04
204,Can’t wait to go back!,"The hotel and staff from check in to check out was superb! Could not compliment the staff in different areas more, so attentive and friendly. The room was excellent and more than what we thought we would get. Me and my partner are looking forward to going back! I understand how the Fitzwilliam is known for its service ",5,2021,08,03
204,Great Location - few areas to improve on,"Overall location fantastic for Dublin. Right where you want to be.
Pleasant and helpful staff who made every effort to help us celebrate our anniversary with a lovely gift and complementary glass of bubbles at dinner.
Didn’t have the most settled sleep due to very noisy ? Rattling Pipes as well as noisy seagulls from St Stephen’s Green! Curtains didn’t fully cover window so lots of light got in.
We had dinner in Citron and food was just ok, probably on reflection should have opted for Glover’s Alley.
Good base for exploring Dublin with a few minor improvements. ",3,2021,08,01
204,Fantastic,"We had a wonderful stay in this hotel.  Alll the 7* staff were so friendly, professional and kind to us.  Luke, James, Alberto and Alex in the Inn on the Green where we had lunch and after diner drinks were very helpful and so friendly.  The reception staff and concierge were outstanding (sorry I cannot remember your names).   The meal in Glover Alley was perfect - it was so easy to do mindful eating with the wonderful food.   The staff were brilliant there as well. We were given a great recommendation for red wine with our meal.      Our room 316 was tastefully decorated in contemporary art-deco style.  We loved it and the bed and great sofa.  Breakfast was perfect.  We are looking forward to returning",5,2021,07,31
204,Brilliant stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"Brilliant location in Dublin City Centre. Excellent and friendly staff. Tremendous value currency for a 5 star hotel.Breakfast is very good and Glovers Alley is serving Michelin star quality food with quality and friendly  service. 
",5,2021,07,30
204,5 stars all the way,I had booked on the Friday night to say & have dinner in Glover Alley restaurant! We got the dates mixed up but the hotel especially Kimberly in reception rearranged to Saturday night without any issues at very short notice! Thank you for alleviating the stress & being so understanding. ,5,2021,07,28
204,Quite possibly the best hotel in Dublin,"We recently enjoyed an overnight stay. The deal included dinner, bed and breakfast plus the generous perk of free parking.
The staff were uniformly excellent. The room, which had been recently refurbished, was great. The breakfast served on the mezzanine was top class and it was fun to watch the chef making my delicious ham and cheese omlette.
The absolute highlight was the dinner. It was in a restaurant called Glovers Alley that's adjcent to the hotel. The food was simply divine. Undoutedly michelin star quality, (or better!)
A thoroughly enjoyable experience which we strongly recommend.",5,2021,07,28
204,The perfect hotel for a city break,"From the moment we arrived until we checked out,  everything about the hotel impressed us.  The staff, the food and our room were all  excellent.  The Luas stop right outside the door was an added bonus.  There were plenty of restaurants, bars and shopping close to the hotel, so the location of the hotel is perfect.",5,2021,07,26
204,Wonderful experience,"We had a most enjoyable stay in The Fitzwilliam Hotel last night. 
From even before we arrived (needed some help finding our way into the car park) the staff were fantastic. 
There was a very friendly welcome when we checked in and lovely glasses of Prosecco too. 
Our room was beautiful and quite spacious for a city centre hotel. 
We dined in Glover’s Alley - such a super experience. The food was just incredible and the service was first class too. 
Breakfast this morning was another lovely experience. 
The staff in The Fitzwilliam Hotel made our experience very special and we look forward to staying here again soon.",5,2021,07,23
204,Five Star Hotel Experience,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in Ireland. Their staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. The service was superb. Their value for money was excellent compared to other hotels in Dublin. It was a proper five star hotel experience at the heart of the city. I highly recommend it and would not hesitate to come back.",5,2021,07,22
204,A wonderful relaxing stay,"A fantastic hotel. The staff were so friendly and attentive. The service, food and drinks were top quality. The room was beautiful. The hotel and staff took great care in ensuring my dietary requirements (coeliac) were looked after to the highest standard.  I felt that the hotel paid great attention to adhering to covid-19 regulations. I can't wait to return.",5,2021,07,19
204,Weekend,Great location. Competitively priced rooms and great breakfast. Really friendly staff. Recommend this as an option if you want good hotel near all things Dublin. They have a range of room standards however even the lowest level is fine. ,5,2021,07,19
204,Exceptional service and great central hotel for families,"Recently brought my two young daughters to the Fitzwilliam for a mini break in the city as a post lockdown treat. I cannot praise the hotel, and in particular the staff, highly enough. When booking the room we spoke to Sebastian who went out of his way throughout the stay to ensure the girls felt special and that this was a real treat for them. We were upgraded to a bigger room and had a lovely view over St Stephen’s green.  The room was lovely, the main bed was very comfortable and the girls slept in a sofa bed and slept soundly. When we checked in the staff all made a point of calling the girls by name and continued when we met any of them throughout the stay. When we got to our room there was a welcome card for the girls and a fabulous spread of treats for them. They were beyond excited. Breakfast was delicious the next day and again a little pack of crayons etc was provided to entertain the kids. It is also impossible to beat as a location! Of note, while I loved listening to the bustle of the city after silent streets for so long, once the windows are closed you can’t hear a thing. I would highly recommend this hotel and again want to commend Sebastian and all staff we met for exceptional service.",5,2021,07,17
204,Very disappointing family stay,"We booked this hotel for a family of 6 …..the family suite we were allocated was on the 6th floor -lift only went to the fifth floor and then stairs to the 6 th floor. The family suite had a double bed in a very small room and a small pull out couch in the adjoining sitting room.
We then had a very small room and bed in the interconnecting room.
So the reasons for this very poor rating 
Stained carpets 
Smell of raw onions in the corridor (disgusting strong room spray used when we mentioned this -no consideration for the fact we have a child with allergies who was sneezing and wheezy all night)
Dirty tiles in the bathroom
Stained chipped furniture in our bedroom
Showers where the water turned to boiling hot independently and could have burned a child’s skin 
Sofa bed not made up at night -telephone not working in our room so had to go back down the stairs, get the lift to reception to request the bed be made @ 10 pm ……took 25 mins for someone to do this 
6 of us put at a table for 3-4 at breakfast after being phoned the previous night to be told we had to be down for breakfast @ 9 o clock on a Sat morning as we were such a large group!!!!!
No parking spaces in the car park on arrival 
Curtains that didn’t close -room bright @ 5 15 am 
Stained blinds 

The only thing that redeemed this hotel was Luke in the bar and the breakfast from the menu !!!
We go to Dublin 4-5 times a year as a family and if you want a 5* hotel nothing beats The Merrion. 
We have also stayed in the Marker,Brooks,the Gibson,the Clayton Cardiff lane,Carlton house and ALL of these hotel are of a much higher standard than the Fitzwilliam
We actually cannot understand how this is a five * hotel ……we have eaten in Andy Mc Faddens fabulous restaurant Glovers Alley on a couple of occasions and it is amazing and without a doubt this is a super bonus to the hotel.
When we complained about all the above at reception we were directed to the front of house manger who offered us a bottle of wine !!!!!
We finally got to speak to the manager on Sat evening and 50 % was taken off our over all bill …still too much in our opinion for the state of the rooms and the service(price originally was €1450 for the above for 2 nights)
This is not a 5* hotel ……the manager tried to tell us that our room had not been refurbished due to covid -if this is the case they should not be using these substandard rooms and expecting families to pay too prices !!!
We worked all through covid and this was our break away from a long busy year!
My advice if you are looking for a 5* hotel go the Merrion or the Shelbourne ……they are far superior",1,2021,07,17
204,Dublin delight,"We booked last minute and upgraded to a signature executive room for a larger size bed.
The room had recently been refurbished and exceeded my expectations. The decor was stunning, and it had a view out to a rooftop garden/courtyard.
The staff were all very friendly with great service, the bubbles on check-in were a delight.
I’ve stayed in many Dublin hotels and this was the best so far. The value and service far exceeded any others, with breakfast and parking also included. And you can’t fault the location, right in front of Stephens Green and a few steps from Grafton St.
My only issue was the gluten free bread at breakfast which wasn’t great, however I provided this feedback to the waitress who was going to pass on to the chef. Also the gym looked very small.",5,2021,07,14
204,JKeane,I could not fault the excellent service . Wonderful views from our balcony and a great location. Thank you to all the staff who assisted me with my newborn in making it a stress free trip. We will definitely return.  ,5,2021,07,13
204,Great Stay,"Overall fabulous stay the staff are a credit to the hotel and go out of their way to ensure everything is perfect. The little personal touches definately made the stay, The only downfall was the decor of the rooms they are in need of a refurb new blinds, carpet and bathroom tiles are required.",4,2021,07,12
204,Fantastic hotel highly recommend,"Fantastic hotel highly recommended foid was gorgeous the staff are a credit to the hotel so helpful and very moved to deal with. 
Location is superb .got a great deal with breakfast and dinner included will definetly be back ",5,2021,07,07
204,Still got it,"Its the little things they say but really it's all about staff at the end.
Stayed in superior room last week and this week we stayed in a suite  - special occasion and thought it was a bit pricey for what extra you got.
Ate on first visit and it was perfect but breakfast is truly a feast.
Bar is quiet and I mean quiet. 
Location is perfect and rooms spotless.
Have to mention the tolitries as well as they are classy.
Again the staff are impressive and you are made feel special.
Can't wait for next trip",5,2021,07,06
204,"Great location, Even better stay",Would definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam for a stay to make the trip to the city centre even better. Location ideal for shopping or a show and is only a short walk to the more characterful Dublin restaurants and pubs that lie between Grafton Street and Temple Bar.,5,2021,07,04
204,Amazing experience,"We were treated like VIPs from check in to check out and cannot say enough of the friendly, professional staff throughout our stay.  We'll be back soon and have no hesitation in giving the highest recommendation",5,2021,07,01
204,june break,"stay June 25th , for one night, premium room, nice to have the balcony that you could sit out and enjoy the view and see the world go by and weather permitting  breakfast as we did on the balcony, only this is dont leave the table, as birds may want some, Dinner in Glovers alley , was excellent, possibly not everyone's taste  service was great and could not do enough for you.. for the level of the room, maybe a bit smaller than what you may expect but , great comfort and no noise.

looking forward to staying again",4,2021,06,28
204,Celebration of our 25th anniversary ,"We stayed overnight at this hotel recently. We booked a package of one night, 3 course a lá carte in the Avery restaurant and breakfast for €299.
Everything was lovely, the service was particularly notable with everyone of the staff friendly and doing their utmost to make sure you were enjoying the experience. We'll done everyone!!

We mentioned on checking in that it was our anniversary and after 20 minutes in the room two glasses of champagne were delivered, a great start.

Dinner that night in the Avery was fine dinning and it was delicious, we enjoyed every course. Each dish is explained to you when it arrives and if you need help picking a wine to accompany it there is some very good advise on hand.

A lovely comfortable bed and pillows. You can adjust the air con in the room so you never have to feel stuffy.
Breakfast the next morning was again very tasty.

We did spend around €100 on drink which consisted of 2 g&ts 2 glasses of Syrah and a dessert wine, but those were our choices.

Overall it was a wonderful night away and we'd love to return if we get the chance in the future.
Covid 19 protocols were definitely being adhered and yet they didn't impinge on our enjoyment. 
",5,2021,06,24
204,Drinks,I came for drinks to the rooftop bar on the 21/06/21 with my three friends. I was really impressed with the service and how well the bar and  floor staff worked together.  We were all really impressed with how in particular Liam and sergio worked and the cleaner Sam. They were so attentive and friendly.  As soon as our drinks were finished they were straight  over to our assurance with anything more we needed. We really enjoyed the drink in the sun on this beautiful Monday.,5,2021,06,21
204,Bank holiday get away,"From the moment we arrived the staff were so attentive. Our room was gorgeous, we went for the standard room and it was beautiful. We had drinks out the front on looking stephens green and it was very enjoyable. The food was lovely! Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough!",5,2021,06,09
204,2 Night stay,"We had a very enjoyable stay and the staff were excellent , food was good, rooms where bright and fresh, turn down service was good and we ordered breakfast in bed both morning, which arrived on time and hot. Coffee was hot also. ",5,2021,06,08
204,"Great hotel, but not great food","Had a wonderful stay here before. This time I didn't get a newly renovated room, which was a let down,  as I stayed in one in Dec last and it was gorgeous. Secondly,  we had casual dining which is a huge drop in quality compared to the fantastic food served in Glover.
Thirdly , breakfast for the second time was lame and ordinary for one person. muffins with eggs, muffins were dreadful.  
In my opinion the 3 course meal was taste less, prawns in creamy sauce minus a chilli kick as per the menu. Rib eye was chewy and unseasoned for both people so we sent it back. The kitchen kindly replaced it with chicken, very bland with wilted spinach... not a good choice of veg in my opinion. 
Dessert tarte was missing cinnamon flavour and the poached pear was miserable. 
The very attentive and friendly staff made up for the bad food experience and offered 2 complimentary cocktails which were divine. 
Disappointing food experience considering how we looked forward to it for so long. 
Suggest hotel gives you a choice of restaurant or lets you know the casual isn't great. We would have paid for extra.
Rate paid 194e pp Dinner and breakfast incl.
I also rang several times prior, requesting a nice room and or complementary upgrade if possible... which didn't happen.
I will return but will check everything in advance is what I want. My sister booked this and had not stayed there before, so was unaware of the choices etc.",3,2021,06,08
204,Excellent Service in a Beautiful Hotel,The staff at the Fitzwilliam went out of their way to make our stay incredible! I cannot stress enough how exceptional the service was at every level. Truly one of the most accommodating places I’ve ever stayed in. Well done!,5,2021,06,06

204,Over night stay,"We had a stay over during covid. All the staff are very pleasant and the hotel was very safe. Breakfast was room service and it didn't dissapoint was delicious.We had a fablous redecorated room. Will definitely go back when everything is back up and running.

204,Simply Wonderful,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a (COVID-Restricted) Family Wedding. I simply cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. The staff made our party of eight feel like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble. They arranged a gorgeous banquet room for us and served us a fantastic meal which tasted every bit as good as it looked! 
The rooms were really nice, very modern and comfortable. If you can manage a room with balcony, I would heartily recommend it for the great views over St. Stephen's Green. Next morning, we were contacted individually by house-phone to discuss our breakfast choices, which was a long list from a full Irish to Eggs Benedict to Pastries and a wide range of tasty options. I personally recommend the full Irish, which was simply outstanding. 
Secure underground parking was complimentary, which was a real bonus in such a central location. 
Overall, though, it is the highly polished and thoroughly professional staff at the Fitzwilliam that made our stay unforgettable. We have decided to return there as soon as conditions allow in greater numbers to do justice to all of the family events which we have been unable to celebrate due to COVID. So thank you to all of the great folks at the Fitzwilliam for a wonderful experience which we will never forget!
See you again soon!",5,2021,03,26
204,"Perfect bed, shower and breakfast","Ticked the most important boxes. I head a great night's sleep, the shower was powerful and the breakfast one of the best I've had in years, with high quality pastries, coffee and the perfect omlette served piping hot to my rooom.
The room decor is perhaps a bit dated but that didn't distract too much from the overall high standard of hospitality .",5,2021,02,05
204,Absolutely Incredible Mini Honeymoon!,"Me and my (now!) husband travel all over the world and we are still raving over the incredible stay we had for our mini honeymoon at the Fitzwilliam! Our entire stay/wedding dinner was curated at every turn by Grace from the hotel's incredible sales team! From the second we walked in, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel like royalty with extra little touches that meant the world to us. We were beyond taken care of and appreciate all the congratulatory gestures. We will absolutely be staying in the future and I highly recommend staying here for your wedding night!",5,2021,01,12

204,Proposal,I recently stayed here and proposed to my girlfriend on the balcony of our room looking over Dublin city. The service was phenomenal. From the moment I got in touch the staff were extremely helpful in organising. When we arrived the staff again we're extremely helpful and friendly. It all lead to a perfect stay and memory. The hotel were amazing and I can't wait to visit again.,5,2020,12,29
204,Fabulous,Stayed with my nephew for Christmas. The service from reception and the restaurant was 2nd to none. The bedroom was beautiful and the whole hotel was spotlessly clean. The lunch on Christmas Day was very very tasty. Would highly recommend the hotel for a city break for Christmas or anytime of the year. Just steps from the hustle and bustle of Grafton Street overlooking the beautiful Stephens Green. A must visit ,5,2020,12,27
204,Great comfort in Central location,"Stayed just before Christmas with my partner for one night. You couldn’t ask for a better location, having a car park was great confidence and reasonably priced. The staff were very polite and helpful, hotel is very clean and kept well. Rooms are decorated lovely and all the modern functions you require in a 5 star. Would recommend to anyone looking for a central location in the capital.",5,2020,12,26

204,Fine dining Birthday experience,"I just want to say thank you for the service we received on our stay 16th Dec 2020.

I had booked a last minute stay for my wife's 40th birthday to Mark the occasion.

The prosecco on arrival and the view from the room overlooking the park were a great to start.

We had a fantastic dining experience in the glovers alley restaurant. The happy birthday fruit plate when we returned to room was a nice thoughtful touch.

",5,2020,12,18
204,Very impressive service in a lovely city centre hotel,"We spent a night in the Fitzwilliam Hotel last week and we had a really lovely time.  We had booked a room with a terrace overlooking Stephen's Green - the room was perhaps not as large or modern (bathroom) as one might expect for ""Deluxe Premium"" - but guess the terrace explains why it had that designation.  (note that terrace was accessed by stepping up through a large window).  The bed was large and comfortable and the room was perfectly adequate and had everything we needed.  Air con worked well and shower (over bath) pressure was very good!  Every member of staff we met was extremely courteous and professional and we had a small issue (with parking) which a lovely receptionist (Kimberley) swiftly sorted out for us.  We were very impressed.  Dinner in Glover's Alley was superb and all Covid protocols and table spacing etc was excellent and felt very safe.  Breakfast in the mezzanine restaurant was also good and tables well spaced out with quite a few choices on the hot menu and again the service was perfect.  Although we live in greater Dublin and would never normally stay in a Dublin city hotel, it turned out to be a really lovely break in these strange times when you can't leave your county, and it was great to be right at the top of Grafton St to browse the shops and enjoy the Christmas lights.  We also had a really nice early morning stroll through Stephen's Green.  We would love to return to the Fitzwilliam and can certainly recommend it highly.",5,2020,12,16
204,A great break and very relaxing,we really enjoyed our stay ......pre Christmas and just after level 5 in place for 6 weeks so this break was much cherished. All the staff extremely friendly and we felt safe and comfortable.Lovely to have the Glovers Alley restaurant available and food was delicious and generous.,5,2020,12,14
204,City Break,Excellent service at very well located 5 star property.  High quality hotel and while the downstairs bar might lack some character Dinner at their Glovers Alley dining room more than made up for it....,5,2020,12,14
204,Simply stunning experience from start to finish!,"If you are looking for a hotel with class, friendliness, elite customer care and much more then look no further than this hotel! Simply stunning! Obviously the location is perfect too but particularly at Christmas as it creates that magical Christmas feeling in and around the hotel! Can’t wait until our next stay already!",5,2020,12,14
204,City centre stay,In general the hotel was excellent. Rooms have zero soundproofing so you could hear a mouse farting in the room at the far end of the corridor. Other than that everything was great. Staff were very helpful and a pleasure to deal with.,5,2020,12,14
204,Fabulous,"Fabulous hotel in an incredible location.  Rooms are newly refurbished and very cosy and comfortable, beautiful bathroom.  Staff are really friendly, nothing was too much trouble and we had a really wonderful time.",5,2020,12,13
204,Retirement tea party,"We recently visited the Fitzwillam hotel for my Aunts retirement, she has been working on the frontline at the children’s hospital in crumlin, and because of covid could not give her a party, so we decided to book afternoon tea.
Well what can I say, it was fabulous from start to finish, the staff where lovely and so friendly, the Manager came over and asked for my Aunt and congratulated her on her efforts to the frontline and brought over a bottle of bubbly, she was delighted, all the staff made a fuss over her. Then the food arrived OMG delicious it was like small appetisers they tasted soo good, we had the Barry’s tea, then the beautiful deserts the mulled panacota was Devine. And just when we thought it couldn’t get any better we were served the best cocktail s I’ve had in ages by Luke who was lovely and chatty. Would definitely recommend to all my friends and will br returning soon, 10/10 👍 ❤️💐❤️💐",5,2020,12,10
204,Modern city Hotel,"This is a hotel with a contemporary design.  I would rate it as a good 4 star with 5 star kitchens. It is very well located for shopping. It has a fantastic restaurant so don't miss dining here. Its a city hotel but it is quite especially.ly rooms overlooking gardens. We found it a safe experience in the time of Covid. Spacing in restaurant was extremely good.
",4,2020,12,05
204,"Awful, don’t stay here in the lockdown there are no facilities, it’s a scam","This is no five star hotel in my opinion, other hotels in Dublin provided facilities during Covid but not here , the manager hides from you as he knows that the service is appalling.... worst hotel experience EVER",1,2020,11,02
204,Short break,"We decided on a break before lockdown and to shop .We are so glad we did,great hotel in the centre of Dublin the room we had was gorgeous recently renovated to high standard The breakfast was delivered to room on time and hot very tasty ",5,2020,10,23

Would have liked to have dinner in Glover alley restraunt  but that wasn't  what was booked but I think it was a mistake on our part .ffod service all very good so cant complain,5,2020,10,19
204,Lovely Dublin Overnight ,"We had a lovely stay here. The staff were great - from reception to the bar staff and to the staff you’d bump into on the corridor, all were so friendly. The room itself was really well decorated with everything you could need in it. Had a stunning meal in Glovers Alley - a must if staying. Breakfast was a little hectic - I’d recommend going off peak. ",5,2020,10,18
204,Amazing hotel and fantastic staff,"Superb hotel. Spent our 10th anniversary here we were treated amazingly well. From Kimberly when booking to restaurant staff and Luke recommendation of whiskey. I have stayed in all 5 star hotels in Dublin and i genuinely had thought Fitz William was not of 5 star standard. I was so wrong. In a time where it’s difficult to forget Covid, we were able to enjoy our anniversary in what was so safe a manner. We had planned to visit Japan but fitzwilliam hotel helped us have a very memorable anniversary in the challenging times. Thanks to all the staff. I am a very hard person to please but I genuinely could not fault from check in to check out.",5,2020,10,10
204,Excellent city centre hotel,"This hotel has teamed up with Glovers Alley restaurant for the duration of COVID-19 restrictions in Dublin. Clever idea very well executed - lovely room, very pleasant service and the opportunity to eat in one of Dublin’s best restaurants - what’s not to like.",4,2020,10,05
204,wedding celebration at the Fitzwilliam hotel,"The staff I encountered when arranging the day were so helpful.  They were instrumental in setting up what was the perfect day for my friend's wedding celebration last Friday.
The day was just amazing and Cormac and Sanda In particular ensured everything ran smoothly.
Thank you for the complimentary drinks, the restaurant was amazing and it’s a day we will never forget, due to your attention to detail! 
I have already told anyone who will listen how wonderful the day was and the amazing staff at the Fitzwilliam and I will continue to rave about the service and positive attitude of every staff member we encountered whenever I have the opportunity.",5,2020,10,05
204,Amazing getaway during the Dublin lockdown,"We stayed for one night as part of a package, which included dinner in Glovers Alley, late check out and complimentary parking.
From the moment I checked in I was made to feel so welcome and was even sent up a glass of complimentary prosecco from the hotel. 
The rooms have recently been refurbished and are stunning! (See my pics) I love the colourful modern vibe and the brass finishings. A nice touch was the inclusion of hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes. The bathroom was beautiful, had such a luxurious feel to it! I enjoyed a lovely bubble bath.
Another nice touch is that there is no tray charge for room service. I ordered lunch and we also ordered a bottle of bubbly and breakfast to the room. 
Dinner in Glovers Alley was spectacular and I will write a separate review for that. 
We ended the night in the Inn on the Green bar, where we had some lovely cocktails made for us. The bar was pretty quiet but considering Dublin is currently in its second lockdown, it was a luxury to even be able to sit inside a restaurant and then go to a bar for a drink afterward.
Would highly recommend staying in the Fitzwilliam, truly 5 star service and facilities.",5,2020,09,27
204,Exceptional Stay - One to remember! ,"We had a fantastic stay in the Fitzwilliam hotel for a birthday weekend in 2 beautiful Signature Queen rooms. It truly was a luxury 5 star stay. 

From arrival, we were made to feel special and were provided a personalised experience. The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. We really appreciated the possibility of an early check in and the Prosecco on arrival was a lovely touch. 

The hotel and our rooms were spotless and we felt completely safe. The hand sanitizers in the rooms were also a great idea. The room was very quiet and had everything that we needed including a great coffee station. The attention to detail provided by the staff throughout our stay was exceptional, down to using our names on the welcome note and the reception greeting us by name if we called them or passed by. We definitely felt that the staff were doing everything possible to ensure we had a unique stay. We have to mention the receptionist, Sanda, who went above and beyond in making sure that we were enjoying ourselves. 

We ate in the hotel’s bar in the evening and the food and service was fantastic, especially under the current difficult circumstances. The restaurant’s burger, fish and chips and cocktails were all enjoyed. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, but we did not catch his name! 

The breakfast was an experience in itself. The food was beautiful and they could not give us enough. We were offered an array of tea and coffees, toast, special jams, pastries and fruits all before our main breakfast from the à la carte menu which had many choices. Our waitress (we believe her name was Gosia) was a pleasure. She was so bubbly and couldn’t have been more accommodating. 

There were so many small details and efforts made by the staff even such as offering tea/coffee to go on our check out that made this hotel stay unique. All four guests agreed that it’s the best hotel stay that we have experienced and this is definitely a reflection of all of the staff who we could see genuinely enjoyed and took pride in their work. 

A massive thank you to the manager, Cormac, who was so helpful and courteous and to all of the team who made this a birthday to remember. ",5,2020,09,25
204,Can't wait to come back!!!,"We had an amazing mid week stay in the hotel. It felt very safe & hygiene standards extremely high especially in the current climate; sanitisers throughout the hotel & very vigilant staff wearing visors & social distancing noted. Our stay was for a birthday gift & there was a beautiful card & dessert plate in the room on arrival which was most thoughtful. Our room was upgraded to a balcony overlooking the park which was stunning & we got lovely weather enjoy it!  The room itself was fabulous, extremely comfortable bed & very quiet. Best pillows ever!!  We got a personalised welcome message & an individual alcohol hand gel which was a lovely surprise. The location of the hotel is just the best, right in the city centre. We had a brilliant time pottering about. There was such an exciting selection on the breakfast menu also! The staff were very helpful suggesting places to eat &  booking taxi's & we even got discount vouchers towards local attractions. We stayed in a few different hotels on our trip but I cannot rate our stay highly enough in the Fitzswiliam & I cannot wait for our return visit. The attention to detail makes it an amazing 5 star hotel. ",5,2020,09,16
204,Another fabulous stay in amazing location with exceptional staff ,"I always love staying at the Fitzwilliam. The staff are so friendly and helpful and fun. A special mention to Gosha, who is so bubbly and  inviting. And she remembered me from my previous stay. The barman who was on duty on Wednesday night, also went out of his way to be helpful and kind. Also the concierge on my check out on Thursday, was a star. Go Team Fitzwilliam- You Rock!!! x

",5,2020,09,04
204,September Visit ,"Stayed here for one night. Was on the 5th floor overlooking the green. A fab view. Bed was a regular double but I was alone so it’s okay. The room lacked a coffee machine for that morning kick which was afforded to my friends on the second floor. The shower was fabulous. The staff friendly except for one barman who asked us “where he would you like to to stick your drinks” we knew what he meant but it is a five star hotel after all. A little crass. The breakfast was most disappointing, two of us had poached eggs and bacon. The bacon was a ball of grease with for fat than daylight. Awful stuff. Stick to the porridge. The parking is free. The location perfect. I would go back. ",3,2020,09,03
204,Great hotel. Pity about the breakfast.....,"One of us was on the 5th floor, with a balcony which has beautiful views over the city. 
The other two rooms were on the second floor. The rooms are all well-appointed, with very comfortable beds and spacious bathrooms.
It’s a five star hotel, but our experience was diminished because of an overly casual barman and a disappointing breakfast. My porridge was perfect, but my friends’ cooked breakfast was spoiled by bacon which was fatty and served with much too much oil. The jar of honey we received had already been opened. 
The staff were helpful and efficient, but the dining area on the mezzanine level was distinctly lacking in atmosphere. 
Having said all that, I’d go back, and I’d have the porridge for breakfast again 😊",4,2020,09,02
204,The Fitzwilliam Hotel,A gorgeous hotel with extremely friendly staff who made us feel very welcome. The location of the hotel is ideal and we felt very safe under the current guidelines. I would definitely recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel to anyone.,5,2020,08,26
204,Excellent stay at brilliant located hotel ,"First hotel stay since COVID and a “staycation” - we were super impressed with all the hotel in place for our stay. 
Cleanliness was top notch and all staff that we saw complaint but without making us feel like we weren’t welcome (as much as you can while wearing visors etc) 
The room was lovely - new bathrooms and beds very comfy.
Breakfast plated and server so friendly.
Location is at top of Grafton street and across from St Stephens green. Couldn’t ask for better. 
Had a great afternoon shopping and out to dinner in city center. 
Well done to the Fitzwilliam in these hard times - you are a great example of how to do it right. ",5,2020,08,25
204,Nice stay,Staff very helpful. Good adherence to covid measures. Great location. We had a balcomy overlooking St Stephens green which is where we enjoyed our complementary glass of champagne on arrival. St stephens green nearby is a nice park for a stroll.,5,2020,08,23
204,Dublin Short Break,If you want friendly service in comfortable surroundings at the heart of Dublin then consider staying here. The staff couldn't do enough to please and assist. The hotel was accommodating with breakfast time and car parking requests.,5,2020,08,23
204,5 Star Staff,"Myself and my boyfriend recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights. First off, the lovely greeting and friendliness of the staff already confirmed that this hotel is worthy of its 5 star rating as the staff took the time to learn each of our names and ask about our plans and how they can help with our stay in Dublin. We were greeted with champagne and a cupcake each and were escorted to our room by a very friendly male member of staff (unfortunately I did not get his name). 
Our room was located down a very long corridor but the walk was so worth it as our room was stunning with a gorgeous modern bathroom to accompany it, we were also provided with fresh bottled water and Nespresso coffee. Unlike most hotels we were able to choose our own breakfast time to ensure no overcrowding which is ideal during the current pandemic, also breakfast is served up to 12pm which stood out to us as most hotels stop breakfast at 10:30am. The friendliness of the wait staff was amazing and they could not do enough for us which was greatly appreciated both mornings. 
On our second evening we decided to stay in the hotel and order drinks in which I asked for a cocktail, the drinks arrived within 10 minutes and were hand delivered by that same friendly male member of staff. The following morning as we were checking out he took the time to ask how I enjoyed the cocktail as he personally made it which was very nice and added to the personalised experience the staff make for each guest. 
Overall our stay at the Fitzwilliam was amazing and we could not imagine staying in another hotel if we were to visit Dublin again as the staff went above and beyond. Also the hotel’s location added to our experience as it is located right at Grafton street therefore we were with in walking distance of the major shopping areas as well as great dining.",5,2020,08,18
204,Excellent stay,"Super welcome, service and location.  This is a first class hotel in one of the best locations in Dublin.  They really embraced Covid 19 safety measures without losing out on customer care.   Would highly recommend. ",5,2020,08,17
204,Great location,Stayed here with my partner at the end of February. Our room was newly refurbished and staff could not do enough to help us! I was shocked at how big the hotel actually is - It is deceiving from the outside! Would definitely stay again. The location is perfect for a shopping weekend as it is just off grafton street. ,5,2020,08,04
204,5 Star Stay,Exceptional stay!!! If you’re worried about staying in Dublin because of COVID-19 stay here!!! All your needs are catered for - best staff in the best hotel.Shauna deserves a special mention she’s fab!! ,5,2020,08,03
204,Excellent location in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel for 1 night as part of a 2 night staycation in Dublin. The location of the Fitzwilliam is one of the best reasons to stay there. We stayed in a room with a large balcony overlooking the front if the hotel which has beautiful views over Stephen's Green and Grafton Street - the main shopping street in Dublin. On check in the front office member, Shauna, was friendly and professional and arranged for a glass of bubbles on arrival. The bedrooms are colourful but tasteful, they're more boutique style than some of the more traditional 5 star hotels. We had dinner in Glover Alley, a fine dining restaurant attached to the hotel. The food and service was outstanding. We had after dinner drinks in the hotel bar. Gareth the barman was very friendly. The next morning we had breakfast which was served in the mezzanine restaurant. On check out Cormac was both friendly and accommodating as we left our car in the car park while we did some last minute shopping. Overall a very enjoyable stay in the heart of Dublin with friendly and professional service.",5,2020,08,02
204,Impeccable,"Our first night away since restrictions were lifted and the Fitzwilliam didn’t disappoint - everything was carried out with comfort and safety in mind, without compromising on their usual high standard of service.  If anything it’s even better.   We had a room looking over St Stephen’s Green with a fabulous terrace, so that’s where we had breakfast which was delicious - Eggs Benedict & Full Irish.   From the impeccable welcome at reception to the good-bye, we couldn’t fault it.   We’ll be back.  ",5,2020,07,29
204,Try the Willy Wonka Afternoon tea it is very pretty & very Special,We had the nicest afternoon & evening with you after been in lockdown for so long. The highlight for us was the afternoon tea you served on our balcony. Truly a memorable experience & very Special. I am still thinking about it. We will be back for more. You are all so kind in the Hotel & go beyond & above to be helpful.,5,2020,07,20
204,Break from the norm,"location was super, the room was excellent, but mostly the staff were extremely welcoming, friendly. The front house porter is extremely knowledgeable on city geography and recommended suitable places for me to you, reception and bar staff were equally friendly, inviting and helpful.  Thank You",5,2020,07,10
204,Pleasant stay superb location for shops,First week open staff superb and helpful . Well trained especially Briegd reception - food good but not spectacular- breakfast in room couldn’t be faulted - very covet conscious - not I did feel it was missing something perhaps depth in reception - the balconies are cramped and not very private- haven’t been there in 16 years but would go back,3,2020,07,05
204,Great Location,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, and great location to all the sites.  Renovations are taking place, and we had two queen rooms in the newer section of the hotel, and they were very modern and a nice size.  ",4,2020,03,19
204,Nice hotel - Excellent service!,"Nice hotel - Excellent service! The hotel is nice with a fine location in the centre of Dublin. The staff is excellent. If you ever consider going to Dublin, you should not consider any other hotel than The Fitzwilliam.",5,2020,03,11
204,Excellent hotel!,"Great location right on the st stephens green. Walkable to everything. Front desk service was courteous. Room was on fifth floor, quiet and clean. Breakfast every morning was delightful, lots of options of juices, coffees, breads, pastries and a la carte items. ",5,2020,03,10
204,Relaxing getaway,"We stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms in the Fitzwilliam. The decor was fabulous and the room very spacious. The staff were so friendly and helpful. 
The lobby area had beautiful flower arrangements and the location is so central.
The breakfast was divine, such a great selection of fresh fruits, smoothies and breads, with a made to order hot breakfast.",5,2020,03,09
204,Great Barman,"Had a fantastic night in the Fitzwilliam hotel with great company and a fabulous barman !! Our barman , Luke  Cullen made the most delicious Martinis! I’ve found my favourite drink and my favourite barman! Well worth a visit",5,2020,03,08
204,Business Trip,"This was the second time I have been to the hotel and it is a great place to stay. Incredibly friendly staff, with great service and well equipped rooms that included lots of extra nice touches, like an umbrella in case of rain when out and about. Will certainly stay again.",5,2020,03,04
204,Amazing ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay over 2 nights. Central location and VERY friendly and helpful staff from the moment we checked in. Our room was lovely from the decor, king bed and the lush robes and slippers. Definitely would stay again. ",5,2020,03,03
204,Great Way to End our Trip,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights at the end of our trip to Ireland.  Super nice experience.  The hotel is situated in the perfect spot right next to St. Stephen's Green and VERY centrally located for all of the Dublin sights.  The hotel itself is modern, very well maintained and the rooms are really good.  Staff was super helpful, valet parking, responsive service and more.  We skipped the internal pub/restaurant, but have to say that the full irish breakfast here was one of the best I had during the entire trip.  A tad more expensive than other options, but I would totally pick them again on the next trip.  Driving in downtown Dublin is a pain, so having hotel valet parking was a godsend so we could just park and then walk everywhere.",5,2020,03,02
204,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed recently at The Fitzwilliam St Stephens Green. Absolutely fabulous Hotel and staff rooms spotless breakfast beautiful.
Staff couldn’t do enough for you. Will be back. Location was super straight off the load line.",5,2020,03,02
204,Not a 5 star hotel,"Unfortunately we were very disappointed with pit experience and would definitely not rate this hotel a 5 star. The room was very small, run down, light hanging off, cold water in a very old shower, small bed. ",2,2020,03,02
204,Old tired and disappointing for the money,"I booked this hotel based upon pictures and my experience of the sister hotel in Belfast.  This hotel is nothing like the Belfast one.  Everything was worn and tired.  The rooms need a major upgrade including new carpets.  For the money, it's not worth staying here - much nicer and cheaper accommodation available.  Shame - this was like an old 3 star hotel.",2,2020,03,01
204,Great location and good stay,"We stayed overnight for a business event.

The Good.

1. A great location right on St Stephens Green and within walking distance of everything.

2. The decor is modern with a focus on purple. The atrium is welcoming.

3. The rooms again have a modern theme and are comfortable. Good storage.

4. The staff were friendly and helpful including in the bar where service was excellent.

5. The parking is under the hotel and was €20 a day which seemed reasonable.

The Bad.

1. The rooms were a little cramped. There was a mini bar which was locked, including the free bottled water. No modern coffee facilities.

Overall.

A pretty good stay in an excellent location.  would be happy to return but not quite at the standard of the Marker or Shelbourne.

2. The bathroom is a bit dated with no separate shower and quite small. There were loads of towels and bathrobes were also available. The shower was not the easiest to work but had excellent pressure.",4,2020,03,01
204,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Had a great stay for a night last week - good standard of room, the breakfast was very good indeed and it’s a great location on St Stephens Green - what more could you ask? 
There are some very good bars and restaurants within a few minutes stroll and if I’d had more time I would have explored the museums nearby.",4,2020,03,01
204,"Lovely hotel, excellent location","Had a lovely couple of nights staying at The Fitzwilliam. Our arrival was delayed, but they were brilliant about checking us in even though it had gone one in the morning.
Lovely room - clean and warm. Breakfasts were excellent!",5,2020,02,29
204,Customer focused staff with a personal welcome,"Great location , all dealings with staff couldn't be more helpful. Breakfast was superb. So great to have hot food freshly cooked to your order. Concierge staff helped to find a park in a very full carpark just at right time to avoid me getting frazzled . All so smoothly done great service",5,2020,02,24
204,Not really 5*,"There was building work being carried out on the rooms on our floor. We were woken up both mornings at 9 am on the dot by loud drilling etc. Yes this is not that early (but when on a relaxing birthday trip it is) but I was not made aware of this work before booking or I would have booked somewhere else.  Location is fantastic,  breakfast not so much. We have stayed in the lough erne resort (also 5*) twice now and their breakfast is without a doubt the benchmark for 5* breakfasts. The full Irish  breakfast here at the fitzwilliam is terrible. Continental wise its grand. Fruit, croissants etc. 

Overall, should be much better considering the price, wont be staying again. ",3,2020,02,22
204,Family night out,Stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel with family and the whole experience was amazing. Great customer service from the moment we arrived until we left. Highly recommend this hotel and it's amazing staff. 👍,5,2020,02,18
204,Afternoon tea,"We visited the Fitzwilliam Hotel for their Willy wonka afternoon tea for my sister in laws birthday. We had a wonderful time. The food was interesting, inventive and very tasty. The choice of tea was excellent too. But what really made the experience fantastic was the staff. The two women who looked after us were welcoming, warm and attentive. I highly recommend a visit here for a special occasion or just a little treat.",5,2020,02,17
204,Amazing!,"Staff were amazing, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
Everything was done with a smile, and a warmth. 
We were brought to the room by one of the receptionist, our luggage was being taken care of by the concierge. And as it was valentine's day we were treated to a heart shaped box of chocolates....very nice way to begin our stay. 
Room was beautiful...I'm 6'3"" and I fit in the very generously sized bath. The bed is super comfortable too! We were lucky to have one of the 4th floor balcony rooms overlooking Stephen's Green Park. Stunning!
It was our first time at the Fitzwilliam, but certainly not our last... thank you very much!",5,2020,02,16
204,Romantic break,"Overall we had an excellent time. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The room was amazing and very comfortable. Although we couldn't open our fridge, when we contacted reception, they sent someone up with some water straight away. ",5,2020,02,16
204,Good breakfast,"Hotel convenient location. Room was nice and cosy and particularly liked the nice touch of the homemade chocs on the pillow.

Breakfast was really good, and service exceptional. Waiter offered to make me a take away coffee which I thought was a nice touch. 

I had room service on evening. Food was fairly bland but not unpleasant. Good quite expensive, but as it the case across Dublin. 

Would definitely stay again, but wouldn't choose to have my evening meal here again.",4,2020,02,15
204,A trip to Dublin fits well here,"This hotel is in a superb location next to St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and the LUAS tram stop. A very well appointed room on the top floor(never a problem waiting for the lift), quiet, bath robes and slippers and a nightly turn down service with chocolates. Best shower we have had anywhere in the world!!

Great choice for breakfast with superb friendly service-the exceptional Team Leader was a real character.

For our trip, sightseeing and The Dublin Racing Festival at Leopardstown, the location could not be better.The Hop On/Hop Off City tour bus stop was within a minutes walk, the tram stop opposite and Temple Bar, an experience not to be missed, about a ten minute walk away. Grafton Street was also right outside the hotel.

Getting to the hotel from the airport was very easy on the bus at a reasonable price.

For a real Dublin pub experience O'Donoghues Bar on Merrion Row(less than five minutes walk) should not be missed. Reasonably priced drinks, friendly service and great traditional Irish music. Plenty of places to eat, traditional and otherwise.

Dublin has so much to offer and see and is an experience not to be missed.",5,2020,02,15
204,City break,"Location is excellent , right in Stevens green. However , our stay was dampened by the fact that  at the bar, we had to listen to one of the bar staff moan loudly and excessively to her colleagues about her working conditions and the fact that she doesn’t get enough tips...we ended up having to bring our drink up to our room to get away from it.room was nice except for lack of cold water in the taps .not pleasant washing teeth in hot water .but I would say the experience with the water was an exception as I stayed here before and did not have that problem.",3,2020,02,01
204,"Fab hotel, with the perfect location.","I have been lucky to stay in this hotel several times. It’s such a fabulous hotel and location is just amazing. It’s right at the top of grafton street. Rooms are fabulous. 
Breakfast is top class and something I look forward to every time I stay.",5,2020,02,01
204,Donegal ladies.,"Five if us stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel on Saturday night and we can't thank the staff enough for making our stay so wonderful in this beautiful hotel.Rooms are lovely and comfortable and the breakfast is just gorgeous served by Kevin and the rest of the staff,who looked after us so well.Thank you all so much we will be back.",5,2020,01,26
204,"The place to ,c","First class welcome.  Friendly, efficient, helpful, well-trained staff - reflects the  quality of the management.  Excellent breakfast with good range of choice.  Certainly a five start hotel in a five star location away from the noise of the city.

204,Dublin Jan 2020,"Lovely stay in hotel with great location, food, drinks and staff. Residents' bar open with no questions asked at 0200 when we arrived back!  Breakfast served until 11am Saturday -  great bonus, loads of choice also. ",5,2020,01,13
204,Excellent Location,"This luxury hotel is in a great location, across from St. Stepehn's Green and a short walk to Grafton St and beyond. 5 minutes to Trinity College, 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar and 20-25 minutes to Guinness Storehouse. The rooms are large and well furnished. The staff, especially the concierge are super friendly and helpful.",5,2020,01,10
204,Exceptional Service! ☘️,"A short visit to Dublin and first time at The Fitzwilliam Hotel turned out as our best to date. Their Attention to detail made our stay extremely enjoyable, considerable and appreciative. The check in team was so professional, hotel concierge guys were extremely pleasant and knowledgeable, room service on the dot! Wow, with a complimentary upgrade to a room with a balcony facing St. Stephens Green.. 2 mins from centre of Dublin, 100s of cafes and restaurants and shopping! By far the best stay in Dublin to date! A massive competition to Radisson & Hilton with by far the most exceptional staff made its stamp on this hotel proud service. Room was comfortable and pillows to die for, we will be back ;)  ",5,2020,01,06
204,Superb,"My husband and I very much enjoyed our two days here. We would certainly recommend. It was conveniently placed by shops and restaurants, which was useful for my husband, who had limited mobility. Breakfast was superb. Staff well-trained and attentive.",5,2020,01,05
204,Far from Five Stars; Look Elsewhere,"Oh boy, where to start: the lobby smelled of sewage (even their many lit candles couldn't mask the odor); the room suffered wear and tear and weak plumbing--in serious need of a revamp; and the food was mediocre at best. 

The only redeeming qualities were the prime location and fresh in-room flowers. But if you can afford it, definitely opt for the Shelbourne or Westbury instead.",3,2020,01,05
204,An excellent stay in Dublin,"I forgot to mention this. My son, daughter and wife were having lunch in the bar and my daughter ordered a sandwich. The bread was moldy and when she told the waitress about it the waitress seemed indifferent and even said ""It happens"". She did replace the sandwich at no charge but the fact that it happened shows there might be a serious health hazard in the kitchen. How could someone make a sandwich and not see that the bread was moldy. If not for this I would have given the property a 5 star rating.",4,2020,01,02
204,Extremely mediocre,Not five star. Tired and shabby rooms. Very poor bathroom. Unhelpful front desk. Would go back just for the bar as staff there were exceptional. Certainly wouldn’t stay there again . No luxury at all . ,2,2020,01,02
204,Mini Moon,"Had a lovely stay for a last minute mini moon to Dublin. Staff were friendly, breakfast was excellent, location was 10/10 and the water pressure in the shower was great. Room was clean and cosy. Hotel is so close to everything Dublin has to offer, would definitely recommend",5,2019,12,30
204,Christmas at Fitzwilliam,This hotel is perfect for Christmas experience we have stayed for our second Christmas and both times we couldn't fault anything. The food is excellent and the staff are exceptionally good. We will return again and will recommend to family and friends ,5,2019,12,27
204,Great location!,"We stayed here for a week over the Christmas holiday.  Stayed in the twin room which was well equipped and cozy.  The view was facing a business so not much for privacy but not a big deal.  Our 2nd night we went to the bar to eat and have drinks.  It was a complete disaster as the food and service were horrible.  The manager Mirko came to us after and knew things did not go well.  He immediately refunded our money and sent us a bottle of wine as a courtesy.  In a five star hotel this attention is appreciated.  We tried room service after that and the food was better.  The location is amazing and right in the heart of the city.  The cleaning staff for our room were fantastic!!! I can't say enough about the cleanliness of the room.  The concierge were super helpful and made sure we had what we needed whether it was umbrellas, plug adaptors, or getting us taxis. ",5,2019,12,27
204,Unsung Heroes,"We are immigrants. One way or another and it's never surprises me how we all come together in the end. 
I was supposed to be in Sweden. Someone else in L.A. Someone even has Tonga roots. Have you ever been to the Phillipines this time of year?
I haven't! Yet we came to Ireland. Better yet we came to this hotel. Sandra, Serra, Roby, Fabian, Martin, Volgan and I'm probably missing out some of the breakfast crew because they were amazing too. Thank you for making our lives worth taking risks. We shall carry it forward. Thank You!

D, K, J & C",5,2019,12,26
204,Excellent Hotel,"Cormac Fadden the Manager makes sure that all guests are treated with the best customer service. He makes the experience more special and meets all the 5 star expectations you want in a hotel. He treats everyone the same and you can notice this even with the staff as they take his lead. Very enjoyable and relaxing time from the Bar to the Breakfast.
Well done and I will be back.
Cheers A.",5,2019,12,25
204,Expensive and disappointing,"We chose to stay in this hotel after staying here last year as a family. We absolutely loved the experience last year, but cannot say the same for this year.
We booked three rooms between us, and while two of the rooms were perfect, the third room had no heating. This was the room where my boyfriend's parents were staying who are both over 60. 
They informed reception of this problem, and were told it would be sorted while we were out at dinner, however upon returning 3 or 4 hours later, it was not. They had to ring reception again, and they sent up a heater and an extra blanket.
They had a very poor sleep, and were not even given the option to move to an alternative room, considering it is winter and heat is essential.

The issue which really disappointed me however was the breakfast. After raving about the breakfast and the experience to friends and family after last year, we had high expectations. None of these expectations were met.
Firstly when we arrived on the mezzanine level at 8.30am we were told we had to go down to the bar for breakfast as they had tables reserved for larger groups, and they had no tables left for our group of 6.
When we asked if we should have reserved, we were told only larger groups could reserve even though we pointed out some smaller tables had reserved signs on them.
We were told the same service would be provided down in the bar, but this is far from the truth.
We arrived to a very small and poor selection in the buffet. For a 5* hotel, I'll admit I expected a lot more than just a handful of pastries and two types of fruit. We have had more of a selection in 3 star hotels.
The hot breakfast was lukewarm at best. I couldn't finish it as by the time I was halfway through, it was cold.
We were given the option to order porridge, eggs benedict etc and I wish I had as at least they would have been cooked freshly.

When checking out, we mentioned the problem with the heater and we were just told they would 'look into' why it happened.
They also attempted to charge us twice. My boyfriend insisted he had paid, and when the staff member eventually realised her mistake she didn't even apologise. Considering the total cost of €807, which is no small amount, she could have at least apologised.

Considering this was a Christmas treat that we were all looking forward to, we all left disappointed compared to the magic we experienced last year.
We won't be returning.

204,Great location,"Great hotel and location and staff on reception and bar were great 
What more do u want me to say computer 
Run out of words 
Needs to sort out your website so will try again mew keep trying but have lost our patience and if this continues our patience will b exhausted

204,A stunning hotel in a central location,"We were put in one of the newly refurbished rooms and, honestly, it was one of the most beautiful rooms I have ever stayed in. The value for money is unparalleled...such a central location and gorgeous hotel.",5,2019,12,22
204,My go to Hotel when in Dublin,"Love this Hotel and its my go to place when staying in Dublin.  Its location is so central to anywhere you want to go. The real gem of this hotel is the staff.  They are so friendly, helpful and cant do enough to make your stay enjoyable and hassle free. The breakfast choice is another favourite of mine. Amazing Hotel ",5,2019,12,16
204,Christmas Afternoon tea on a lifeless mezzanine,"Christmas afternoon tea was beyond appalling. At €39 euro a rip off with poor service. The tea came well before the platter. The group was served at different times. Afternoon tea was portioned for two.....there were four of us. The mezzanine only had one other group who also complained of the food, both groups ended up with plastic pieces in tiny Christmas puddings. The Fitzwilliam  did not have an option for vegetarians or gluten free...despite booking ahead and informing them weeks ago.  You can however have an undercooked risotto from the bar without asking for it.... but it will cost you way more......because it’s afternoon tea. THE WORST AFTERNOON TEA EVER. As a side note .... cheap Christmas decos in a five star hotel with Christmas light that continued to flicker because they have the wrong transformer, I will never go back",1,2019,12,14
204,Afternoon tea ... Avoid avoid avoid,"The afternoon tea menu is advertised as a gift from the gods .... well the gods must hold a deeply deranged dislike of the fitswilliam hotel customers. 
Lulled in by the websites blurb I booked for myself and my sisters for our Christmas catch-up. Huge fans of afternoon tea and the usually delicate delicious dainty offerings we partake more often then we should but never ever have we had such a dreadful experience. We had rang ahead to say I was a vegetarian and they said they'd gladly accommodate. When we arrived I again told them I was vegetarian and they said this was fine was I ok with cheese/risotto etc I explained that I was as I am not a vegan. My sisters afternoon tea arrived first on the traditional afternoon tea display platter but instead of three servings of each item on the menu there was 1 or 2. Not wanting to cause a fuss we said we'd say it to the waiter when he returned with mine. A half our later he came out with mine......an enormous bowl of risotto..... has the chef lost his mind on what planet is a bowl of mushroom risotto afternoon tea - which by the way costs 18euro in the bar and I would have had to pay 40. I said no thank you (it was grey and smelled disgusting) so they said theyd be back. Another half hour later they came back with 4 tiny items on a plate for me - 2 tiny trifles, 1 slice of beetroot with a piece of goats cheese the size of 1 cent and a mince pie the size of a 1 euro coin. I called for the manager as there was no way I was paying for this rubbish. He promised to rectify and said I wouldn't have to pay for the risotto- well I hope not since I didn't want/order or eat it - but he said he'd ensure the bill was appropriate. All fine we didn't want to dwell and moved on, in fairness to the manager he did bring out more food for my sisters but they didn't still receive everything advertised on the menu and were a few items short. Although one sister did get a large lump of plastic in her pudding ball (as did the lady on the next table) so maybe they thought that would count. I on the other hand got nothing more..starving at that point the lump of plastic was starting to look quite tasty. And so we asked for the bill to which they in all their benevolent pomp said they'd only charge for 3 afternoon teas instead of four - for three partial afternoon teas and 1 inexplicable tiny vegetarian mess, I told them to try again. They then returned with a bill for 2 afternoon teas which I thusly paid and left the hotel scavenging in my pocket for a free sweet I'd recieved earlier that day in the supermarket to tame the hunger pains. Never ever ever again to return. Save yourself the stress and money and go literally anywhere then this disgraceful hotel, the chefs should be deeply ashamed and google what afternoon tea consists of.",1,2019,12,14
204,Perfect Location in the City Centre,"This hotel is in a perfect location for a weekend in Dublin. Just a few steps away from the main shopping street, Grafton Street, restaurants, coffee shops and the famous Gaiety Theatre; and across the road from St Stephen’s Green, the beautiful city centre park complete with lake and ducks if you want a few moments peace and quiet. It also easily and speedily reached by the Aircoach link from Dublin Airport. A ten minute walk from the coach stop in Kildare Street; the same on the way back leaving from St Stephen’s Green (North). The hotel itself is comfortable, friendly and welcoming. Perhaps a little on the pricey side, but this is the Capital city, and you have to pay for such a central location as you would in any other Capital cities. Recommended!",5,2019,12,11
204,Lovely hotel - could improve organization,"Outstanding location and beautifully renovated. Rooms were very luxurious. Bit disappointed that after having had a whole email conversation about type of room we wanted to book, we got a room with twins rather than a double bed and two rooms not adjoining. Bar/ restaurant served lovely food but service was poor - twice we had to abandon rounds of drinks which took 15-20 mins to arrive (party of 7 people ordering soft drinks and guinness so nothing complicated). Food took a long time and on one occasion they forgot to put in order. Having said that, the food was delicious when it arrived. Apart from those quibbles we had a very good stay and would return.",4,2019,12,08
204,Quick family trip,"We had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin. We will absolutely return to Ireland. I picked this hotel because of location, trendy decor and smiling faces on the Fitzwilliam website ;) It was our first time in Ireland. Even though most of my friends recommended renting a car and driving around Ireland, I opted to stay put in one place and do day trips...largely because the biggest stressor for our family is driving in new countries. Having been, I do think we will return and rent a car and travel around. But, I am glad we chose the Fitzwilliam and stayed put for our first trip. We traveled with our 3 children (aged 21, 18 and 14) We did get 2 rooms...1 the Family Suite for the kids and a Deluxe Double for me and my husband. The hotel was absolutely the best for walking around. Saved the cost of a rental car. We walked everywhere. And, the meeting point for the tour we did take was within walking distance.  Everyone was incredibly friendly. Some of us took public transportation to the hotel and some of us took a taxi. The taxi was only 30 euros. We never sat in the restaurant at the hotel but at the hotel only ate room service...my older daughter had a lot of college work to do.The menu was good, the kids liked the food. One item wasn't available..I think we still had a summer menu in our room rather than a winter menu. There were a plethora of restaurants nearby. We had a great view of the park. Plenty of space in our rooms. The bathtub was fantastic per my 6'4"" husband who said it was the first hotel bathtub he fit in.",5,2019,12,08
204,Great location!,"Lovely hotel. Perfect location to enjoy Dublin! Rooms were lovely, Bathroom great. Felt special at Christmas with wonderful decorations. 
The breakfast is amazing in both taste and staff attentiveness! ",5,2019,12,07
204,Decent Hotel,"Typical for a hotel in a bigger city, the rooms are average size - unfortunately for us, ours was above a night club that could be heard until the very late hours. Aside from that the hotel is lovely.  ",3,2019,12,05
204,NOT ACCOMMODATING FOR HOTEL GUESTS,"We stayed in room 528 and despite my best efforts to close the dirty clothes cupboard which was next to our room, it was repeatedly left open with a fire extinguisher.

When we went to the bar for dinner and a drink, we were told all seats were reserved for parties who were not staying at the hotel! Crazy. We sat at one anyway as there were loads empty and were left waiting 30 mins for a drink, I actually ended up calling back the manager who told us we couldn’t sit at the table to complain about the service.

On top of that, the towel rack was left in the hall outside our room all weekend. I can’t understand why it wasn’t in the cupboard which could have been closed.

",1,2019,12,05
204,Business Trip to Dublin,Stayed here as part of work trip and the hotel is part of the corporate plan.  Beautiful hotel and in a great location ie. close to St Stephen Green and Grafton Street shops.  Room rate included a great breakfast buffet ( continental buffet and cook to order).  Older style hotel with well maintained rooms.  I liked the coat/scarf hooks at the front door especially in this weather and the fluffy towels in bathroom.  Small items that could improve; blinds did not close fully and curtains left gaps where an outdoor courtyard is lit up all night.,5,2019,12,03
204,Almost perfect,"A couple of irritations but overall almost perfect
The hotel's strongest point is their lovely friendly overseas staff 
The front of house team are welcoming, warm and helpful.
Despite the hotel being on St Stephen's Green we were given a room over the gardens which was verypeaceful.",4,2019,12,02
204,First stay and very impressed!,"We were visiting the city for one night on Saturday to celebrate a milestone birthday with family.
Everything about this hotel - location, service, rooms, not to mention the lovely staff - all contributed to an enjoyable stay.
We dined out at a restaurant close by and returned to the hotel bar for drinks.  Being able to sit and enjoy the rest of the evening in a relaxed atmosphere, with drinks at a reasonable price, added the finishing touch to a memorable night.
Our room rate included breakfast.  There was an abundance of choice, with gluten-free options, and all freshly prepared ingredients.
I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and plan to return in February in advance of a wedding celebration in Cavan.",5,2019,12,02
204,Welcome at the fireplace on st Stephen's Green.,"Perfect location for a Dublin vacation.  Be aware that you may vaguely hear buskers from Grafton Street, but in return, you get a great view of St Stephen's Green and the relaxing sound of the tram bells.  

Our sofa bed wasn't working and the staff quickly and smoothly provided a rollaway bed.  The next day, they moved us to a slightly bigger room and nicer room.   The hallmark of a front desk is how well they handle issues and this team gets 5 stars. 
The concierge sent us to an amazing restaurant and c secured a difficult reservation. We enjoyed sitting in the lobby with our tea by the fireplace.  
Bravo, Fitzwilliam.  This was our second visit and we hope to return again. ",5,2019,12,02
204,Such a lovely stay! We’ll be back,They really couldn’t have been more welcoming to our little family! Often banished to dark corners of hotels when you have kids .. not here! Super welcoming and kind to the kids- brought them jelly beans after check-in and lovely little busy packs at breakfast.. fab room amazing service. Breakfast was delicious. Could not rate it highly enough! Such a treat for everyone,5,2019,11,30
204,Lovely stay in the heart of the citi center,"We had a short stay at the Fitzwilliam but it was eniugh to make us wish we had booked more nights with them. Our flight landed at 5am amd they were kind enough to let us check in several hours early. The room was spacious and well maintained and decorated in beautiful, royal purples and greens. The hotel was very quiet and the bed comfortable which is a welcome relief after an overnight flight. The price is more than reasonable considering it is within walking distance of several sights. All and all, a lovely hotel. ",5,2019,11,30
204,Central Hotel,"Excellent location right beside The Gaeity, Grafton St & Stephen’s Green Shopping centre. Cleanliness, room service, Reception, Breakfast food& staff & concierge are fantastic. The bar leaves slit to be desired. Our order came out wrong, we got items we didn’t order, had them replace but were charged for everything- this was a bad service for a Monday night at6pm. ",4,2019,11,27
204,A Very Happy Birthday,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights last week for a ‘Big Birthday’. The hotel knew this (not from us) and we received a free drink in the bar on arrival. Some nice cards left in the room along with some free scented candles not to mention a fruit and chocolate platter were a lovely touch. Our room on the 5th floor overlooked St Stephen’s Green. The room was lovely, the staff friendly and willing to help. The hotel is friendly but not stuffy in any way. Many Thanks and see you again!",5,2019,11,25
204,Back Again,"I don't do reviews - usually, but love the Fitzwilliam so much that I'm doing this one. Excellent staff, great location, great accommodations, great bar and breakfast. So good that we bring friends along with us.",5,2019,11,23
204,Excellent customer service ,"Stayed here for a conference recently.  Rooms very comfortable and spacious. Fab showers.  Excellent breakfast.  The outstanding feature of this hotel is the customer service.  All employees could not do enough for you.  A real asset to this hotel

204,We couldn't be happier,"We deviated from our pre-planned Ireland tour to spend out last night at the fitzwilliam hotel, dublin.  It was one of the best decisions we made.  The location and service at this hotel are exceptional.",5,2019,11,21
204,Great location but..,"Stayed here for 5 nights. Fantastic location, walking distance to Grafton street, shops, and right on St. Stephen’s Green. Staff helpful though a bit intrusive (if they knock on your door for the turn down service and you don’t respond within 3 seconds, they come right in), nice included breakfast. However, the hotel is dated and air quality is poor indoors (windows don’t open unfortunately). Outlets located in awkward places. The kicker for me was that I made some tea using the in-room amenities and realized to my chagrin that the tea tasted like soap or shampoo. I guess it had been washed in soap or shampoo and was not thoroughly rinsed, ruining the specialty tea bag I had brought with me. I probably would not stay here again. ",3,2019,11,20
204,We didn’t want to leave,"Everything about our stay was absolute perfection. Lovely, friendly and professional staff who really couldn’t have done any more for us. Beautiful room, cosy, well appointed. Luxurious bathroom with huge bathtub and high quality toiletries. We enjoyed a few drinks and dinner in the bar ( good value for Dublin prices) and had a scrumptious room service breakfast.  Cannot recommend enough and we can’t wait to return.  Worth every penny.",5,2019,11,18
204,A class act,"I won’t go into too much detail but just to say I was there to celebrate getting some good news after illness, what the staff and management was pure class. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful environment in a wonderful part of this great city. ",5,2019,11,18
204,Weekend stay,"Great location right where you need to be and great hotel. Very classy. Staff very friendly, funny and courteous. Rooms were fantastic lovely beds and great sleep. Parking discount was very welcome. Expensive per night but I guess that's just Dublin.",5,2019,11,18
204,Absolutely FANTASTIC,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin for 3 nights for our 25th Wedding Anniversary.
We had a fantastic experience and couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough.
Everything about our stay was superb, from the warm and professional staff to the amazing room.
We can't wait to return in the near future.",5,2019,11,17
204,Fantastic stay and location,My husband and I visited Dublin for an anniversary trip. The Fitzwilliam hotel was fantastic! It was elegant and upscale without being fussy or pretentious. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was perfect! Right on St Stephen's Green and right at the end of Grafton street for easy access to the river and Temple Bar areas. I would highly recommend! ,5,2019,11,12
204,Weekend Break,"Fabulous weekend, great hotel with a great location, just on St Stephens Green.  Breakfast is fabulous and the staff are great, very helpful and friendly.  We even got an upgrade as it was my husbands birthday.  Will definately return.",5,2019,11,10
204,Ireland Vacation,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for only one night. Would definitely come back again!  The service was excellent!  The daily breakfast on the mezzanine level was amazing and included in our package which we booked through Costco travel. Our room was beautiful. We came in off the redeye and the staff got us into our room by 10 am. The location is perfect!  Right across the street from St Stephens square park and adjacent to tons of the best Dublin shopping, restaurants and pubs. ",5,2019,11,10
204,"I've been here many times in 9 years, and it has gone downhill unfortunately","I’ve been coming here since 2010, mostly for the location and the quiet courtyard rooms.  I always stay in the same kind of room (the standard room facing the courtyard) but decided to get a slightly larger room this time (deluxe king).  It really wasn’t worth it, and I was having a hard time getting confirmation that I would face the courtyard as the people who answered the phone were never clear about it and never described the rooms as they were described on the website.  The heating/AC is actually a lot noisier in the larger room, and you can’t ever really sit on the balcony with the weather here anyway.  The sofa was so dirty, I put a sheet over it so I could sit on it without feeling like I was going to get a rash.  So, I really don’t think the big rooms are worth it.  All of the finishes are exactly what they were in 2010. The hotel is finally starting a refurbishment soon, which is much needed.  The carpet is really getting worn out and the place just feels very used.  When the heat turns on, it seems like my allergies are made much worse.  I'm guessing the system hasn't ever been cleaned out.

There were a handful of other irritating things that happened during this stay. My shower didn’t drain. I had to wait for maintenance to put Drano down there and fix it but it still didn’t drain.  What is the point of a high pressure rain shower head if it’s all going to fill up the tub to your ankles?  Getting this scheduled was also bizarre because they at first they insisted I stay out of the room when it was done - which was inconvenient and not necessary.  There was literally no odor 10 minutes after it was done.  Why would I have to leave?

My bathroom light was buzzing so loud that I again had to call maintenance to ask them to fix it. I hate calling maintenance on my vacation - this stuff needs to be fixed when the rooms have a guest check-in.  They came and spent 15 minutes fixing it and the maintenance guy’s dirty shoe prints were then all over my tub and bathroom.   So, I asked housekeeping to clean it but they were gone so the guy just wiped everything with a towel which is not cleaning.  I  just wanted a spray cleaner so I could do it myself but ""housekeeping was gone"" so I guess that means no access to cleaning materials?  They're locked up?  This whole thing was about an hour too, from start to finish.  Again, not what I want to do when paying $350 a night on vacation.

The rooms are so incredibly dark, I truly found it hard to pack without additional light and they did bring me a small lamp – but I don’t understand why these rooms are so dark.  Maybe they’ll put in more lamps in the new design.

Breakfast is pretty good, and everyone is very friendly in the restaurant.

Now for extra weirdness: Leah at the front desk called me at 9 AM because they ""had to have someone check the internet wifi booster"" even though the internet worked fine. I had a do-not-disturb sign on and tend to sleep late because 9 AM here in Dublin is 3 AM at home.  The maintenance guy was in my room for 10 seconds and left (after I waited over an hour for him to get here – so why was it so necessary to call me at 9 AM?)  I got the breakfast fees waived due to this, but lost sleep is not made up for by food.  She just kept saying it’s “part of their essential maintenance” – but it obviously could wait till 10 AM or later.  This all made no sense.

I like the concierges here.  They’re always helpful. They seem to be more friendly and service-oriented with laundry and generally being attentive than I remember them being in the past.

In many respects, the hotel is not really how I remember it from the last 5+ visits.  I like the location and the fact it’s quiet, but it’s getting worn out and I cannot understand some of the other problems.  Even my bill was wrong when I left (as was my reservation confirmation in writing - so they only verbally assured me of my room type - which then caused the incorrect bill upon leaving). They refunded the extra charge.  Still, I had more visits from maintenance in a 4 night stay than I had in a year in a former apartment.  

I can’t count the number of times I’ve looked at the view of the courtyard while waiting for the elevator or walked to Grafton Street around the corner.  I loved this hotel and hope they can change the way they deal with maintenance (checking things before guests arrive - foremost) and that the refurbishment will improve the worn out rooms.  Also, the service issues are just bizarre for this place.  I've never really had a problem in any former stays.",3,2019,11,07
204,A little bit of Heaven in central Dublin - Great Location!,We booked this hotel through our travel agent for our 50th Wedding Anniversary trip to Ireland.  We were staying only two nights before heading to our next destination.  This was like heaven!  We were so tired from the long day coming from California when we arrived.  When we did lay down (only to rest) we were so comfortable that we fell deep asleep!  They have a terrific facility and we very much enjoyed the breakfast selection.  We had afternoon tea which was great and later drinks in the bar.  The concierge team were so helpful in booking things to do for us and also just giving great advice in general.  Our room overlooked a central courtyard and was well equipped.  The shower was great.  Housekeeping was excellent turning down the beds at night and giving fresh chocolates on the bed in addition to making sure the towels were restocked.  Everyone was so kind and very helpful.  The location by St. Stephen's Green was superb.  Great location for shopping and the theater also.  We would highly recommend staying here - it is a real treat!,5,2019,11,07
204,Great hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Fantastic location, great hotel and great service.
Trip was a three day break in Dublin with my son and hotel was brilliant platform to make our trip special. We were able to visit a large number of tourist spots by foot from this central location and when at the hotel we were very well looked after by attentive staff. I will definately return to the Fitzwilliam again",5,2019,11,04
204,Wonderful place to spoil yourself,"It has been a while since we stayed here last, but without doubt one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I made the reservation direct with the hotel and it was as part of a birthday evening out for a show & dinner. There were good recommendation for dinner and some things to do.
From the moment you arrive until you leave you are treated so friendly and yet very professionally. We were upgraded to a fabulous room overlooking the Green with a balcony and a thoughtful note with fruit expressing birthday wishes. 
Breakfast in the restaurant is lovely and caters for all tastes with lovely fresh fruit and diary options.  
Thank you for making a special occasion ever more special. I do hope we get a reason to stay with you again soon.",5,2019,11,04

204,Would stay here again,It is a nice place to come back to after a day of exploring. Nice amenities and good water pressure. The cupcakes that we received on Halloween were a thoughtful (and delicious!) gesture. Good location in the heart of Dublin. ,5,2019,11,02
204,Superb,"The Fitzwilliam is an unassuming hotel in the heart of the city, but when you enter the building your experience starts. The staff are attentive, but never overbearing or intrusive. The level of service is unreal but always subtle. Things just seem to... happen. Your every need is anticipated and catered for. You will be waited upon, but nothing about this is snooty or ott, it's perfect.
The hotel is right at the corner of Stephen's Green and Grafton Street, but is modern and quiet. The rooms are lovely, well decorated with all conveniences you'd expect and a few more. Food, especially breakfast, was top notch.
Highly recommended. ",5,2019,11,02

204,awful attitude and service,i was socialising with a friend on Friday evening - I asked a member of staff about leaving my car in the car park overnight - i was assured that was ok and there would be a charge of 20euros- when i went to pick up my car i was charged 38 euros! the  hotels duty manager lied to my face and told me that the 20 euros charge was only for residents and was displayed at the car park. I went and took a pic of both signs to prove her wrong. She just shrugged and wanted me to identify the member of staff who had told me the 20 euro rate! Finally I had no choice but to pay full price - appalling attitude - and an appalling way to treat a guest. avoid this hotel at all costs!!,1,2019,10,26

204,Never fails to impress,"My sisters and I booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel 6 or 7 years ago as a treat for my mothers birthday. As mum is not quite as mobile as she was the hotel seemed perfect as it was central and right beside her favourite shopping street Grafton Street. From this first trip which was so successful it has become an annual event where my sisters, my mum and her 2 friends meet up - 7 of us in total. The trip is made extra special because of our stay in the Fitzwilliam and we all look forward to it year after year.  As I said there are so many positives that can be attributed to the hotel. It probably is in the higher price bracket, but for what you get I feel it is worth the extra. The location is superb.  The rooms are beautiful and I especially love the extra touches in the bathroom - the candle holder with tea light, the extra heavy towels and the shower that would blow you away it is so powerful. The tasteful colours in the rooms blend so well together. The breakfast is just delicious and you are spoiled for choice. I would love a week stay to sample all the items on the menu. There may be other hotels that offer fantastic food and rooms in Dublin city centre, however, the main reason we go back year after year is down to the  FANTASTIC staff. From the minute you pull up outside the hotel to when you leave you are treated like royalty. I sometimes feel like a fraud as we are just ordinary ladies who like a bit of shopping and pampering The door person , the reception staff, the concierge make you feel so welcome and in a genuine manner. They engage in conversion and seem genuinely interested in their guests. It is a special weekend for my family and the staff seem interested to hear our story even though they meet so many guests daily. I particularity want to mention 2 staff who went out of their way to be helpful and attentive and we all want to thank them. Kevin Carroll was more than helpful at breakfast and was particularity obliging when my sister and I arrived Sat morning after an early start from Monaghan. Also Valentina who served at breakfast both mornings put a smile on our faces as she looked after us. All the staff were super attentive but I just felt these 2 people in particular deserve a huge thanks. I highly recommend this hotel which will enhance any stay in beautiful Dublin. Until next year.... Thank you to all the Fitzwillliam staff.",5,2019,10,21
204,Wonderful hotel but frustrating management and cost grabbing,"The hotel was truly lovely in terms of facilities, with a very comfy bed and some excellent service. I thoroughly enjoyed my 2 day stay.

I am frustrated with my experience however. I booked to travel for work and received no notice about breakfast. Online booking shows complimentary breakfast is provided for all parties in a room, so I rang to check and was told breakfast was available for 2 guests in my room (their words, not mine). Therefore I brought my fiancé along and day 1 breakfast was fine. On day 2, I was told his breakfast would cost EUR 26.50 (which is extortionate!), so I spoke to Shauna (manager) who could not find evidence of my phone call where I checked before arrival. I was treated quite coldly and Shauna insisted I was wrong due to a confirmation letter which I had never seen before and dismissed that I had rang to check to be sure. The previous day's breakfast had created no charge, so obviously I was confused, but this was also dismissed. She eventually relented and offered to make the breakfast complimentary (which I am grateful for, however should not have been an issue in the first place), but not without insisting again that I was wrong and making me feel like I had scammed the hotel, or that I was incompetent.

At check out, I was also told I had a laundry charge to pay, which was not mine. Thankfully the member of staff at the desk was able to quickly remove it and I appreciated that he did not try to make me feel stupid again.

Another annoyance was that my colleague had requested an omelette without ham at breakfast, which was then delivered with ham. The restaurant did offer to change it, though I think this is rather worrying given that many people do not eat ham for personal reasons and it could cause a lot of chaos if this mistake was repeated.

The silver lining to the poor breakfast experience however was Maicej (and apologies if I've misspelled your name, I only got a quick look at your tag), who was wonderful trying to help me rectify the breakfast drama. He truly went above and beyond to make sure that we were okay and had a pleasant experience, understanding that it was not our mistake.",3,2019,10,19
204,Everything you want a hotel to be.,"Arrived after a long flight and our room was ready! Room was charming, spotless and while on the smaller size (it IS Europe), perfect in every other way. Had tea one afternoon in the main area; drinks in the bar and tapas at Grazing. The only area for improvement would have been the table service in the bar.",5,2019,10,15
204,Good location but garish decor,"The Fitzwilliam in conveniently located within Belfast.  The staff was excellent and the buffet breakfast had ample choices. 
The room, however, left a little to be desired.  While clean, with a comfortable bed, the decor looked as though it came out of a house of ill repute.  The room was small, and while not unusual for a city hotel, the little room available was taken taken up by a large purple sofa.  On the positive side, we were able to use the sofa as a luggage stand, as space was at a premium.  The room was kitted out with mirrors, except for where one was forced to plug in the hairdryer.  For that, I used the reflection of the TV.  The bathroom was newish, but black, with absolutely no place to place toiletries.

Obviously designed by someone who never stayed in a hotel and approved by someone with questionable taste.

The staff was its saving grace.",4,2019,10,15
204,"Excellent location, excellent property","Ours was a brief stay but top notch.  Marina at the front desk was  the ultimate employee.  The location was close to bars, restaurants, Trinity College and museums.  We will stay here when we return next year.",5,2019,10,13
204,Great Hotel and Location,Excellent stay. They took great care of my wife and I. Fantastic location right in front of St. Stephens Green. Lots of shops and restaurants around that you can walk everywhere. Don't keep looking this is your hotel! We would definitely stay here again.,5,2019,10,13
204,5* location 5*star staff but not 5*,"Fantastic central location, nice lobby and very welcoming staff. As others have said drainage smell in lifts. Room was a big disappointment, small and rough round the edges. Cracked mirror cracked sink, dated,  shower over the bath (not good for a pregnant lady!!) and small dated bathroom with cracked tiles.  Very poor service at breakfast whilst very nice staff a 40 mins wait for hot food which was very sub standard. However when I raised this the staff dealt with it very professionally and recognised it on the bill. So I do appreciate the way they dealt with it. It’s really not a five star hotel but has a five star price tag and for the same price we could have stayed in other well renowned 5 stars in the city. The staff are what keeps it going I think.",3,2019,10,13
204,Top Class,"Excellent stay. Hotel is very central, close to many shops and restaurants. Staff very friendly and ha helpful. The room and bathroom were large by European standards. Rooms are well soundproofed so you will get quality sleep ",5,2019,10,13
204,Great hotel,"If you are looking for a great hotel that includes a lot of attention and help from the staff this is your place.  We enjoyed every moment and if we ever return to Dublin this would be a first choice.  The rooms were spotless as well as the entire Hotel and their attention to detail is wonderful.  The daily breakfast/buffet was also very very good - lots of choices both made fresh hot from the kitchen to great breads, fruits, cereals, juices.  If we every return to Dublin this would be our Hotel of choice and its located right at the end of Grafton Street next to St. Stephens Green.",5,2019,10,11
204,"Amazing Hotel, Wonderful Location, Incredible Staff","I really enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam. I was in Dublin for a week working and the location is unbeatable. Steps away from Grafton St, St Stephens Green Shopping Center, the park, restaurants, bars, etc. The room was spacious and immaculate. The staff was very accommodating and helpful with every request I had. The best part of my stay was definitely the included breakfast! The waitstaff was always pleasant and wonderful and set me up to have a good day every day with their positive attitudes and smiles, despite the less than pleasant weather outside. I will recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone visiting Dublin in the future! ",5,2019,10,10
204,Best Business Hotel in Dublin,One of the best locations in Dublin - close to Grafton Street and St Stephens Green Well appointed modern rooms. Good wi fi etc. Friendly staff.I have stayed at this hotel twice a year for over ten years - and will continue to make it my hotel of choice.,5,2019,10,09
204,Broken Window,"All was fine with one glaring exception .... the first room we were taken to clearly had a broken front window that wouldn't close. It was cold, rainy and windy outside and you (as in my wife and I but apparently not the bellman that showed to the room) could clearly hear the wind blowing into the room. The bellman even made an effort to close the window without success and then left us there. After a few minutes we realized this wasn't going to be acceptable and after confirming for ourselves that the window was broken, called the front desk who insisted on sending maintenance up to investigate even though I made clear that no maintenance person is going to be able to fix a broken window frame. 10 minutes later the maintenance person agreed with us that there was nothing he could do. So another call to the front desk telling them to find us a new room and we're told there are no other rooms available fronting on the park. Fine, please get us another room. So we wait another 45 minutes with no call back from the front desk. Finally call back down to inquire about their progress in moving us and we're told the bellman will be up shortly to move us. Another 15 minutes goes by and finally we are moved to what turned out to be a much nicer room, albeit at the back of the hotel.
While this was finally worked out I expect more from a hotel such as the Fitzwilliam. We should have never been taken to our initial room as it was obvious the window was broken. If this wan't already reported by the previous occupant (unlikely to not have been mentioned), then the cleaning staff should have noticed and reported it. Finally, the idea that our initial bellman finagled with the window and couldn't get it to close, and simply acted as if nothing was wrong is unacceptable. Further, the idea that it took over an hour to get my wife and I into a proper room after reporting the problem is not the way a stay at the Fitzwilliam should start off.",4,2019,10,08
204,More like 3 star than 5 star!!,"Rooms were small & in need of some TLC, staff not very friendly & sewage smell in the lift areas. The bar lacked atmosphere, definately not the quality of 5 star we have stayed in better 3 stars.  Would not return !!",1,2019,10,07
204,Excellent Location,Great hotel with great views over the street and up towards Grafton Street. The rooms are small but have everything you need.

204,A wonderful hotel,"The location of the hotel, the comfort and beauty of our room, the obliging, friendly staff made for an ideal visit to Dublin. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel.

Theater, museums and movies are close, too.",5,2019,09,30
204,Excellent experience,"We loved our stay at the Fitzwilliam, everything was first class. We appreciated the turndown service and the bath products. Our room was very comfortable and had fresh orchids as well as chocolates on pilllow",5,2019,09,29
204,A Disappointing Stay,"My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam last week. As usual, we looked at TripAdvisor for Dublin and were reassured that this would be a fine place to round off our Irish trip. Indeed, many things were excellent - the staff could not have been more helpful or professional and the location was perfect. Breakfast was high quality and well-served. However, the hotel looks tired and in need of some work. The common area downstairs, for example, had furniture that needs some paint or replacing. We chose a superior room with a garden view, which in reality is a view of the rooms across the garden. The bathroom sink was badly cracked and the bath had high sides without a proper grab-handle, again a sign that some renovation is needed. Outside our room, an empty water bottle lay against the wall of the corridor for most of our stay. The bar/restaurant food was adequate but again not up the standard we expected. This cost us $600/night, more than the Fairmont Pacific Rim in Vancouver, for example, which is on a different level altogether. We travel a lot, so we know what we were expecting in Dublin. Time to clean things up a bit, we think, Fitzwilliam. Oh, and the WiFi was inaccessible every evening, probably due to many users.",3,2019,09,28
204,Cozy Stay in Dublin,"I had a quick business trip to Dublin (first time).  The hotel staff were accommodating and friendly the entire stay.  They took their time to give me access to the day room so I could shower and change before more first meeting since I arrived early in the day and my room wasn't yet ready.  Positioned on Stephen's Green and near a pedestrian street, it was optimal for seeing some of the sights as well.",5,2019,09,28
204,"Great Location, quiet rooms","What an excellent hotel - location, food, service, everything!

The quietness of the refurbished room that I stayed in completely belies the location of this central Dublin hotel.  The couch next to the window is a beautiful touch.

I didn't eat here in the evening, but the breakfast was terrific, although there was a 10-minute wait as they were at capacity.

The service was second to none and all the staff I spoke to could not do enough.

Next time I'm in Dublin I'll be back.",5,2019,09,27
204,Perfect Location for City Stay in Dublin,"We stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel for one week in September.  We chose the Signature Queen Room.  This room is fantastic, large enough for a week's stay, it has a window seat which can double as a table for the room service tray.  The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was large and very well equipment with fabulous shower over a very deep and large bath, great lighting and mirrors, as well as a magnifying mirrow :-)  The room came with robe and slippers and Dipiityque products.
The staff at The Fitzwilliam are the jewel in the hotels cap!  You can except exception custdomer services from all of the staff (door staff, reception staff , concierge, hospitality staff and housekeeping).  We were made to feel very welcome by everyone.
The position of the hotel is across from St Stephen's Green and on the doorstep of the best shopping and restaurants in Ireland.  We would recommend this hotel.

204,The Fitzwilliam hotel,The Hotel was within walking distance of many things to do. The hotel staff was spot on from answering questions to assisting with any needs.

204,Ireland vacation,"We started our Ireland visit in Dublin and opted to stay at the Fitzwilliam due to its location and prior good reviews.  We were not disappointed - we were very pleased with the highly attentive and friendly service as well as with the exceptional accommodations.  The concierge took care of our luggage when we arrived and arranged for a taxi when we departed and assured our bags were safely stored in the taxi trunk while we settled our bill.  The buffet breakfast, while pricey, was quite yummy.  A mix of hotel guests and local business meetings were taking place during breakfast.  The room was very clean and nicely appointed. Frankly, the shower and tub are worth the trip alone - you’ll never want to get out!  Bed was very comfy and room was quiet except for an occasional door closing. Overall, this is an exceptional property and conveniently located to most of the Dublin sights via a nice walk.  Don’t worry about the rain, the there are umbrellas for the guests in the lobby.

204,First Time in Dublin,"This hotel has the potential to be 5 stars but they need to work on a few issues.  Let me just say that the staff was very nice and wonderful.  The hotel need a big renovation; everything is very old and outdated in the rooms.  I also booked a deluxe premium room online that said it was 38 square meters and I got a room that I’m not sure was 20 square meters.  We had to move rooms the next day because the room was not big enough for 2 people.  Apparently, the hotel was sold out when we checked in so they just put us in a small room without telling us even though the rate stayed the same as we were staying in a deluxe premium room.  Make sure you check your bill before you leave because they charged us 125 euros for a limo service that we never used.  The hotel is in an excellent location but I’m not sure that’s enough for me to stay there again.",3,2019,09,17
204,THIS HOTEL WAS DISAPOINTING,"while the hotel has a perfect location, it did not give us that 5 star feeling, the staff were very friendly and couldn't be more helpful, but the hotel the room we stayed in was very noisy and overlooked by another building, for what we paid for 1 night stay, we expected much higher quality
",3,2019,09,16
204,Expecting a 5 star hotel,"Very disappointed.  Not up to standard.  Bar food inedible.  Breakfast buffet good but cooked food terrible.  Found it to be very dated would call it more a poor 4 star hotel.  Bathroom tap dripping,  no way of turning off standing lamp and reception did not know either had to find the plug to disconnect which meant I had to move the dressing table. ",2,2019,09,14
204,Perfect place to be,"The Fitzwilliam is ideally located. Steps from the tram, St Strephens Green, shopping, bars, etc.  My room was spacious, quiet, well appointed and comfortable.  Morning breakfast delicious. The wait staff attentive. There is a nice bar/cafe. The higher end restaurant Glover’s Alley is lovely. Would love to stay again. Just put a wee bit more light in the hallways.",5,2019,09,10
204,Very nice stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin in late August 2019.  We were in a Signature Queen Garden View room.  The room was very nice.  Air conditioner worked great.  The front desk staff and the concierge/bell staff were extremely helpful and pleasant.  We arrived early and checked into the hotel, but our room was not ready.  We went to lunch and received a phone call about an hour later than our room was ready (before check in time) and our bags had already been delivered to our room.  

The location is fantastic as well... their is a Luas (tram) stop right outside of the front door and the hotel is only a few minutes walk to shopping and many restaurants.",5,2019,09,09
204,"Nice, but not 5 Stars.","Located in the heart of Dublin City beside St. Stephen’s Green. The exterior and lobby are nothing incredible but pleasant, reception is hidden down on the left in a dark little corner. The reception staff were incredibly attentive, courteous and polite, escorting all guests to the lift.

Our room (212) was teeny tiny and in bad need of a refurb. The decor and furniture are just outdated and this is instantly noticeable and certainly doesn’t warrant a 5 star rating and €330 per night price tag. The bathroom was nice, but again, small. The worst thing about the bathroom was the toilet was lopsided, in that it was not attached to the wall properly when installed and as a result, it felt you were sliding off the toilet when you sat on it.

If the price tag per night was lowered then this is the perfect hotel for a city centre break/night away but right now certainly isn’t worthy of its 5 star rating or the price they charge.",3,2019,09,08
204,Disappointing,"We stayed two nights in this hotel for its central location and overall excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We had completed a 10-day cruise and looked to complete our holiday by staying in a 5-Star hotel in Dublin.  Upon entering the hotel, reception is hidden away in the back. Reception staff pleasant and escort you to your room, for us our room was on the third floor at the end of a very dark corridor. Our room was one of the smallest I've ever been in, our cruise-ship cabin was bigger!  Not enough room for our suitcases. Furnishings and carpet were worn and dated. The bathroom had a tub/shower, which is a safety hazard just to climb into. Room was uncomfortable to stay in. We looked to check out after one night but the hotel accommodated us with a room that had a walk-in shower. Again this room was on the small side. Appreciate the change of rooms, but aesthetically this hotel has Zero appeal. I fail to see how this hotel has a 5-Star rating. Other much better 5-Star hotels in the area. Would not recommend this hotel, very poor value. Expensive Dublin Rip-off. 

",2,2019,09,07
204,Great place to stay,"Nothing is too much trouble for the staff here. Excellent bar staff the team for breakfast which is enormous fantastic. Go team Fitzwilliam,
Luke at the bar was great very helpful and despite being 24 well travelled and knowledgable Gosia inceribly helpful recommended severa” great cocktail bars hic hic !
",5,2019,09,07
204,Wonderful Hotel in Dublin,The Fitzwilliam is a wonderful hotel that is centrally located in Dublin.  The rooms are comfortable.  Take the time to enjoy drinks in the bar and good food in the restaurant.  The Fitzwilliam is a nice hotel  but its their staff that makes the hotel a true gem.,4,2019,09,07
204,Great location and responsive staff!,"Would definitely stay here again! We were just steps away from the city center with the theaters, shopping, restaurants, pubs, and of course, street entertainers!  And, the beautiful and historic St Stephens park is just across the street.  The reception staff was exceptionally welcoming and congenial and our room was beautifully furnished. Definitely don't skip breakfast!  There is a buffet in addition to a great selection of menu items.  We especially loved that they served fresh honeycomb in a tray that you scrape out with a fork!  ",5,2019,09,05
204,Worth every penny,The staff at the Fitzwilliam are very welcoming and try their best to make you feel at home. The concierge was very helpful to find not only excellent restaurant bookings for dinner but also private tour guides for any excursion you’d like to take. ,5,2019,09,01
204,A week in Dublin,The location is excellent for those who come to attend the functions at the Royal college of Surgeons next door; especially after the late night gatherings.I will always return to the hotels where I can open the window a little to get a little fresh air. ,5,2019,08,31
204,Great Experience,"I'll make this short and sweet.  Just an overall great experience all the way around.  Without question, some of the friendliest team of associates I've ever encountered--they bend of backwards to make sure the stay is top notch.  Great location with ideal access to great restaurants and fun pubs.  I would not hesitate recommending or staying at the hotel again.",5,2019,08,30
204,Eye Opener,"This was our first visit to Dublin, Ireland. We were taken by the friendliness of the people. Very happy to assist attitude, the kind we had in America some 30-40 years ago. A must visit again to see the rest of this beautiful country! ",5,2019,08,30
204,Great Vacation!,Wonderful time in the  great city of Dublin! Our stay at the Fitzwilliam only made our holiday more enjoyable! A great staff greeting upon arrival and the helpful friendly staff made our holiday complete!,5,2019,08,30
204,"HOME AWAY FROM HOME ................ luxurious , elegant and with seamless service .","From the moment you pull up outside - you are greeted by the most friendliness Porters - Martin , Dane  Victor or Patrick ,  Proceed to reception where the bubbly smiling  friendly Laura greets you or Lisa or Shauna on our last visit  they all make sure all your requests are met .  In the bar you have the such friendly bar staff any bar could possibly have overseen by Maggie ,  the sfaff - Kevin , Aaron and  Gosha what can you say they are so  chatty , friendly and  welcoming .  The diningroom where you the menu is so extensive and the buffet  a feast for a King  with Kevin the restaurant manager who goes out of his way to make sure you are well looked after on each visit .   All the diningroom staff are so friendly and efficient here naming just a few  Magic  , Wagner and the Brazillian girl , I would also like to mention the Kitchen Porter sorry did not catch his name is working here for 15 years I believe  such a welcoming person and on his trips out with the delph wishes you always a welcome back - should be in the front of the house in my opinion.    This is a hotel run by the friendliness of managers Cormac  who seems to greet all his guests and look after their requests .  the Fitzwilliam is a home from home ....  luxurious , elegant and with seamless service  5 star all the way ...",5,2019,08,28
204,Needs updating,"Service is good, convenient location, but the hotel is in big need of being updated.  Everything was old.  The furniture and fixtures are scuffed and scratched.  the bathtub wouldn't drain properly.  The AC is weak.  The window to the balcony wouldn't open. ",3,2019,08,27
204,5 star dublin stay,"Fabulous hotel, in the most central location. The staff are amazing and couldnt do enough for us. 
Breakfast is a must here!
The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated. The bed was comfortable and shower very powerful",5,2019,08,27
204,Best first experience!,"Our first trip to Dublin, Ireland. We were absolutely blown away by the friendliness of the people. From the cab drivers to the concierge. They take a pride in their job & your satisfaction means the world to them!",5,2019,08,26
204,Five Stars for the Fitzwilliam,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is central in Dublin.  It's located across the street from a park and within walking distance to pubs, the Temple Bar area, and the river Liffey.  It's a 5-10 minute cab ride to the Guiness Factory.  The staff at the hotel is incredibly helpful; they arranged rides to the airport and were available to answer any questions we had about the area.  We booked a room that included daily breakfast, which was delicious and offered a variety of choices  We had to wake up very early one morning because we were boarding a bus to Belfast; the hotel arranged a boxed breakfast and had coffee/tea waiting for us as we left.  We appreciated this very much! The rooms are very clean and spacious; bed was super comfortable.  I highly recommend this hotel while in Dublin!",5,2019,08,25
204,Short stay,"Perfect location for what we needed. The only thing marring the experience was the fact that you could hear the next room (showering) very loudly and there were a lot of doors slamming in the wee hours of the morning...I presume some visitors leaving to catch an early flight. 
Otherwise lovely hotel with excellent service.",4,2019,08,23
204,Let down by the little things,"Could not call housekeeping from our room due to problem with phone. Requested firm pillows but was not done. Our rate included hot breakfast but we were not made aware of this so we missed out. Lastly the CD player in the room didn't allow phones to be connected by USB for music so why are they even there? Totally redundant, no one plays Cds these days ",3,2019,08,23
204,Great stay in the centre of the city,Two night stay at the Fitzwilliam in a standard room- great check and very welcoming staff - Escorted to our room - nice touch - Room was spotless -  adequate size but not large by any standards..  all conveniences and house keeping excellent ... Well worth the money paid and will for sure be back !,5,2019,08,22
204,Amazing stay,"Staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, made me immediately fall in love with the city and the service was impeccable. Perfect location, it was a quick walk away from everything we wanted to see. Couldn’t recommend the hotel more!  ",5,2019,08,20
204,Nice resort in the perfect location,"This hotel is in the perfect location for eating, drinking, and sight-seeing, right across the street from St. Stephen's Green. Our room was surprisingly small, but very clean and with a nice small balcony view of the park. Concierge are fantastic and very helpful with reservations, etc. Don't be shy about using them! Note that valet parking is the only option at 20 euro a day.   We had rather mixed service in the bar/restaurant, but the drinks were good.",4,2019,08,19
204,3 day stay in Dublin,"We stayed here after a tour around Southern Ireland. As soon as we arrived, staff couldn't do enough for you and this was consistent throughout our stay. Very clean and comfortable rooms with lots of extras. Amazing breakfast with lots of choices including fruit smoothies, pastries and many hot breakfast options. We had dinner in the bar which was tasty as well as trying different cocktails. Would highly recommend as a treat when staying in Dublin.",5,2019,08,19
204,Great hotel and perfect location,"We stayed 2 nights at The Fitzwilliam hotel and would highly recommend.  Perfect location, close to shopping, restaurants and right across street from St. Stephen's Green, a beautiful park.  While hotel is located within a very busy area, it was quiet and clean.",5,2019,08,18
204,Our stay...,"Once we found the front if the hotel , our GPS took us to the side alley where we found ourselves trapped in a horrible one way system, the staff and hotel were great . A pity the lift doesn’t go all the way to the top floor, but the very helpful porters always seem willing to assist. 
Lovely modern hotel with all the components for a very comfortable and pleasant stay in the city centre. We would definitely come back here ( especially now we know where the entrance is!).",4,2019,08,18
204,Very good accommodations,"We enjoyed a more than adequate room with an appealing breakfast during an overnight stay. I would recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin to travelers and it is centrally located, clean and comfortable.",4,2019,08,17
204,Five Star Service,"We arrived in Dublin at 4:30 am and made our way to the Fitzwilliam around 6:15 in the morning.  I was intending just to be able to check our bags as we would tour around the city our first day in Ireland.

Instead, they were able to find us a room on the 6th floor that we could check into immediately.  It would be the same class room as we booked but one small flaw, the elevator only went to the fifth floor and we would have to walk up one flight.  We were also told at least three times that if the room was not satisfactory, they would be able to change us later in the day,

Well, the room was just fine, large, clean and comfortable and in tip top condition.  We never bothered to change.  The couple of early morning hours gave us a little extra sleep before starting our first day in Ireland and made a huge difference.  

Breakfast was included and consisted of a cold buffet with cereals, meats, cheeses, breads and hot items off the menu.  The morning staff were extremely friendly and offered coffee ""to go"".  Would have like to have bacon or sausage on the buffet, but I think both were on the menu.  Technically, I guess that first breakfast was not included, but they just made it complimentary.  You are our guest, no problem!

Location is pretty much ideal on St. Stephen's Green.  We took the 757 Air Link bus from the airport and it dropped us off on the other side of the green, about a five minute walk.  We only needed a taxi once, to get out to Kilmainham Goal.  The rest of the time all of the key sites and areas of Dublin were less than a 15 minute walk.

WIFI was good, TV was okay - would have liked CNN and maybe a few more choices.  Room had a programmable safe.  If I am forced to find a complaint, room furniture was slightly worn.  But, as I say we were perfectly content with our room on the sixth floor.  Guest with some mobility issues, may just take note of those rooms.

Our day tour picked us up in front of the hotel.  But I can't say this is common for all tour companies.  

Could not have asked for a better hotel experience our first few days in Ireland.",5,2019,08,17
204,Great hotel in a fabulous location,"We thoroughly enjoyed being looked after at the Fitzwilliam. Staff were great throughout, they listened carefully and answered quickly and effectively. Breakfast was expensive but well worth it - you must try it at least once on your stay.  Rooms were very well presented and felt larger than expected. The reception team and concierge crew all helped in any way they could with advice of where to go and making bookings for us as required (ie Guinness Storeroom and Jameson's Whiskey). 
Definitely a walking city, Dublin is a wonderful, if expensive, visit. Situated right next to St Stephens Green, it is a prime location for enjoying all things Dublin. The staff, food and accommodation were all of a high standard, proudly presented by every member of staff.
The Temple Bar area was busy as expected and the tours were very well thought through. We loved the Irish music being played everywhere, the Guinness based Irish Stews and the overall conviviality of the locals - all were generous with their time and advice wherever we went. We'll be back sometime soon.",5,2019,08,16
204,Highly recommended. Don’t miss the breakfast!,"We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed everything about this hotel. We were in room 206 (Queen bed - very comfortable), which faces the park and a busy street with a tram stop, but the soundproofing was excellent.  A/C was effective and quiet. We enjoyed the luxurious robes and towels, the nightly turndown service, and extreme friendliness of the hotel staff. Our room had a full sized bathtub and separate shower with the strongest water pressure we have ever encountered. Excellent central location for sightseeing and shopping. A bit removed from the loud nightlife scene, but within walking distance. The breakfast was excellent!!!",5,2019,08,16
204,"Excellent staff, location and gorgeous rooms","Great experience very well located and helpful kind and professional staff. Rooms gorgeous clean and very comfy. 

Very quiet although it it located in front of Stephen’s garden. 
 
Good breakfast (healthy
Options)
",5,2019,08,15
204,"Excellent hospitality, great location","The room was clean and pretty, with a real orchid. The linens were high quality and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was pretty as well with a long deep bathtub. Service and hospitality were top notch. The hotel is located at the corner of St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street so there are plenty of places to eat, shop and explore.",5,2019,08,14
204,Wonderful hospitality,"Booked in for a short stay for a special occasion, and the hotel certainly did their part.

They were generous and warm in their hospitality to mark the occasion.  The facilities themselves were very good, a comfortable room, excellent food and bar - and staff in both.

The location is simply unbeatable of course, right at St Stephens Green and the top of Grafton St.

Only suggestion is that the WiFi be improved a little, it was consistent but felt a tad slow, but certainly not a deal-breaker. 

Overall, a great place to stay in Dublin city centre.",5,2019,08,13
204,BLOWN AWAY,"I am a bit of a hotel snob and before booking any hotel, tour or restaurant, I do a lot of research. Having never been to Ireland, I was heavily relying on reviews and information I could find on the websites.  I am always hesitant, even with great reviews and pictures, until I see the room and hotel for myself. WOW!!!!!!!  We were NOT disappointed!! The hotel, from the minute we walked in, was welcoming, fresh and beautiful!!  Your  staff is unbelievable...so friendly and helpful. The young lady, who checked us in, was courteous and sweet and even walked us up to our room and showed us all the features of the room! I am sorry to say that I don't remember her name but did notice her name badge said 'Trainer' or 'Trainee'.  Our room was GREAT!  Even though there were 3 of us traveling, my hubby, my 20 year old daughter and myself, the room was still very comfortable. The bedding and bed (King) was so comfy and allowed us to get  a great night's rest. Our daughter was on the pull out sofa bed and after the first night, we  requested a second mattress for the sofa, which  the staff promptly saw to, and then she was very comfy, too!  The bathroom was very well appointed and there was plenty of room for all 3 of us to set our toiletries out for use.  The only thing I could say would be that the shower was fairly small and made it difficult to shave and would be  almost impossible for a larger person. There, is however, a gorgeous bathtub if you are so inclined!  As you walked into the room, there was a small foyer area, which was so helpful, because we were able to put all our shoes out and there was a coat rack for umbrellas and rain gear which was most definitely needed and used!!  The armoire space was very spacious and very nice to hang our clothes.  And talk about convenient!!! Stephens Green (think a small Central Park), is, literally 10 steps across the street.  There is a train stop right across the street as well, but we never used it.  Grafton Street, which is one of the main shopping districts, is 30 seconds from the hotel's door. We never walked more than 15 minutes to any attraction that we wanted to see!! This hotel is SO  centrally located in Dublin. Temple Bar area is only 5-10 minute walk away. There are probably 50 pubs within a 15 minute walk. I can't say enough about how pleased we were with our stay here. If we are ever so blessed to be able to visit Dublin again, I won't even look at another hotel. THIS is where we will be! It's like home!",5,2019,08,12
204,Amazaing Hotel and Staff," The rooms are very nice, service and staff amazing.  Thie history surrounding the hotel amazing. 
Highly recommend having breakfast many choices, of course must have the Irish Breakfast and the Americano Coffee.  Saying hi to Laura from Reception, Patrick from Concierge, Ellen from the bar and Magik from Breakfast.",5,2019,08,12
204,Super!,"The Fitzwilliam provides a wonderful experience for any travelers to Dublin.  it is conveniently located, staff could not be more helpful, rooms perfect and food delicious.Would definitely recommend a visit. ",5,2019,08,12
204,Overnight stay,"We loved the welcome we received from the hotel's receptionist - so warm and friendly.  Our room was one of the refurbished ""art deco"" styled bedrooms which we loved.  It was a short and sweet overnight stay made special by the warm welcome and delicious breakfast.",5,2019,08,08
204,Great hotel,"As always, the Fitzwilliam Hotel is a home from home. Great facilities and a super location in the center of Dublin. Excellent and attentive staff who are always willing to deliver the service you need and are extremely accommodating. I would highly recommended this hotel, best in Dublin.",5,2019,08,08
204,Excellent weekend stay,"Perfect location for a weekend in Dublin! 
A few minutes walk and you're right in the heart of the tourist hub. Lots of shopping and dining options all around. St. Stephen's Green is right across the road, and so is the tram.
Room was very clean and comfortable. ",5,2019,08,07
204,Great Elegant Well Situated Hotel,"My wife and I recently spent four nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin.
We were touring the southwest of Ireland and spent two nights before the tour started and two nights after the tour.  I'd like to give special thanks to Dane, the concierge, who was spot on with all his dinner suggestions as well as his site visit suggestions.
In addition, Dane, helped us coordinate trips outside of Dublin.   The hotel is very clean and quiet, with a great location right off St. Stephen Square right in the center of Dublin.  Easy walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and Grafton Shopping Center",5,2019,08,07
204,Disappointed experience,"The hotel location is perfect but unfortunately it doesn’t feels like a 5 star hotel at all. 
The room is not clean at all. Although we requested deep cleaning. 
The hotel location is perfect but unfortunately it doesn’t feels like a 5 star hotel at all. 
Rooms: the room is not clean at all. Although we requested deep cleaning. 
Hospitality: Satisfying us as guest and trying to enhance our experience wasn’t a priority therefore we immediately decided to check out to another 5 star hotel.",2,2019,08,06
204,"Location, location, location","Great central location at St Stephens Green. Easy access to LUAS and buses to move around Dublin. Direct access to Grafton and Dawson street shops, pubs and restuarants. Modern rooms, excellent breakfast, good service and staff support. We stayed for 3 nights. All good but you pay for it, not cheap.",4,2019,08,04
204,Not as advertised,"Receptionist mostly clueless and new to the job.
Lobby and rooms need a serious facelift and better ventilation: Lobby, elevators, and the bar smelled like fried food. 
The most expensive rooms with park view are on the smallish side with worn out furniture and bathroom. 
The rooms are not noise proof so noise from the street, corridor, and all the neighbors will be heard in the room, which makes for very uncomfortable sleep. 
These days the hotel seems to be catering to tours and large groups at deep discount,  and it shows in the quality of lobby, rooms, and service.
There are many other hotels with as central a location, avoid this one.
And if you get a good rate, make sure that you know the dimension of your room and specify working A/C in the summer. Although the hotel advertises as Five Star, there is nothing 5-star about the hotel, so keep your expectations low and avoid disappointment,.",2,2019,08,04
204,Close to Amenities but...,"Room good, staff friendly and helpful.    Bathroom could have been better planned: - small. Would have preferred shower room and more hooks.    Pretty seating in bedroom but not comfortable as no support, one comfortable chair, so could be contentious.  Did not use breakfast or dinner as expensive, rather visit Bewlays for wonderful breakfast in  wonderful surroundings.   Particularly stained glass.",4,2019,08,04
204,THE ‘FITZ’ FITS THE BILL PERFECTLY,"Two of us stayed in the Fitzwilliam (the taxi driver called it the FITZ) for 3 nights.
We arrived before 3 pm but our room was ready.
It was very comfortable.
The breakfasts were fabulous and the waiting staff, especially Majek, were great.
We loved the ambience of the hotel and it’s excellent location on St. Stephen’s Green.",4,2019,08,01
204,Central location,"First time at this hotel. What struck me at every level was the staff. All smiles, courteous, helpful and professional. We as people support businesses with great people. Thank you to all the people at this hotel. All lovely people. ",5,2019,08,01
204,Wonderful stay in a great location,"The staff at the Fitzwilliam were the icing on the cake of a lovely stay in a super location. The rooms are nicely decorated, quiet and clean. Sited across from Stephen’s Green Park and around the corner from Grafton Street, not far from the Temple Bar, the Fitzwilliam is a perfect place of respite from a day of discovering Dublin. Included breakfast had loads of choices and was easily accessible. Wonderful place. ",5,2019,07,30
204,Excellent on all accounts,Great hotel!  Great location! Great staff! We would choose this again when we next visit Dublin. The staff were especially accommodating and pleasant.  You can't beat the location as you can walk to all of the major sites.,5,2019,07,30
204,One of a Kind Hotel,"Our traveling group of thirty people arrived in the evening by coach. All hands were on deck when we got off the bus. The staff were friendly and willing to assist us. We were welcomed into the reception area. Each couple was handed an envelope with their room keys. And shuttle schedules for the morning were distributed. A very classic hotel, which focuses on your every need.  Chocolates and cookies were greatly appreciated! What a great way to spend your last night in Dublin!",5,2019,07,30
204,My usual stay during business trip,"I really like the place because of the location. It's in the hearth of Dublin. Easy to get around and my office is just a few minutes walk from there.
The staff is very friendly and really makes you feel home which is a real help over a 3 weeks stay.
The breakfast is really good, and the selections is more than enough but still you can make your own from the menu and the staff will do their best.
Spent enough time in the bar as well. Staff is excellent, great selection of both Irish and Scotch whiskies and cocktails are really good as well.
Rooms are comfortable, but I prefer to stay in a room with has window to the yard instead of the street because the street/park view can be noisy in the morning when the parties are finished and the crowd walks by. Specially on Saturday and Sunday morning.",4,2019,07,29
204,Great Dublin Hotel,"We stayed on the 5th floor of this very comfortable Hotel. The amenities in the room are more than adequate which makes one’s stay very pleasant. The breakfast is quite good and the staff make sure all your needs are satisfied quickly. The bar is very pleasant however we found it very warm but that is typical Dublin. The hotel is in the heart of the city which is ultra convenient and I found the price for a capital city reasonable.
We really enjoyed our time in Dublin and the hotel helped that experience.",4,2019,07,29
204,very central hotel,"My husband and I stayed here in July for 2 nights, I chose this hotel because it was central and I wasn't disappointed. It is very close to shops, restaurants, pubs and attractions.
Also the breakfast at the hotel was excellent.",5,2019,07,28
204,"Great location, great service, great hotel!","My husband and I stayed here recently to celebrate  our anniversary in Dublin. We loved this hotel! The staff was very friendly, the rooms trendy and comfortable, and the daily breakfast was very good. This hotel is right in the mix of great shopping and lots of restaurants. We also decided to tour the city using the hop on hop off bus and the nearest stop was right across the street at the park. The gentlemen at the concerige desk recommended great restaurants every time we asked and Kevin, the head waiter for breakfast, was exceptional! He also recommended restaurants and took special care of us each day. I would definitely go back to this hotel.",5,2019,07,26
204,JL,"A fine hotel, rooms are not cleaned to expected standards !! Breakfast area is full and is more like a 3 star hotel cafe. Rooms are in need of a high grade updating program. Reception staff are great and very helpful....",3,2019,07,26
204,Fabulous Staff and Customer Service!,"Loved how warm, welcoming and accommodating everyone was at the Fitzwilliam! The location of this hotel was wonderful, a close walk to so many of the Dublin attractions, restaurants and pubs. Small touches, like decorated cupcakes on the Fourth of July added to the warmth and friendliness. The head waiter at breakfast exuded an excitement for his job and made sure that everyone was happy and well taken care of!",5,2019,07,23
204,This is not a five star hotel. I would not recommend.,"This is not a five star Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Westin last year and loved it. We decided to try the Fitzwilliam this year based on the reviews and because it is across the park where we can take our grandkids. We booked two rooms for five nights at 329.00 euros per room per night. Our rooms were outdated, in need of complete refurbishing. There is mold where the bathtub meets the floor, rusty trim around the vanity, chipped wood trims, “floating” floor boards when you walk on them, stained old shades on the windows. Apparently the hotel was fully booked so there was no chance of changing rooms.
There were two unauthorized charges on my credit card which were corrected when I made them aware of it. I am wondering if this is a conscious practice, and to me looks very dubious.
And the cherry on the cake? My iPad went missing from our room the day before checkout. We made several calls to the front desk about it but they did not find it.
When I returned home, I called again twice and requested to speak to the manager, Mr. [-]. It is now five days later and I have yet to hear from him! 
One positive thing I must mention is that the breakfast staff was outstanding.",1,2019,07,23
204,Almost but not quite ,"We relocated to the FitzWilliam for 2 nights because we felt insecure and disappointed with The Gresham, from where we checked out after one night. We saw the FitzWilliam when out walking and loved its location and it’s overall “look” so we booked for 2 nights in a Queen room. On checking-in the room turned out to be tiny and the bed looked like it was the old-fashioned 4’6” size so we asked to move, which was done instantly to a very comfortable room with a king-size bed and a large window seat. BUT this room turned out to have a few flaws, which were (1) isn’t it strange that a 5-star Hotel does not provide a bottle of water for its guests? (2) the curtains were too short so the room was never properly dark (3) the shower was fitted over an unusually high-sided bath which was quite dangerous to get out of (4) the bath towels were on the small side (5) I know they’re a protected species (why???) but couldn’t they do anything about the family of seagulls nesting on the Hotel roof a few feet away? It was impossible to have the window open after 04.30 because of the racket! On the positive side, breakfast was 5-star and the Parking Garage is super-convenient. So it’s a pretty good if rather pricey hotel and we’d stay there again. ",4,2019,07,23
204,Super location and beautiful rooms,"The location of hotel is really good, only 2min or less away from main shopping street Grafton St, just opposite the park but don’t have to worry about noice at night from the pubs/clubs. Rooms are beautiful and clean, makes you feel comfortable immediately after a Long flight. Didn’t get to try out their breakfast and would definitely consider the next time back in Dublin",5,2019,07,22
204,Highly recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The rooms were very nice and comfortable, the service was excellent and the breakfast was delicious. It is also in a great location, being close to everything. It is directly across the street from the very beautiful St. Stevens Green Park, right around the corner from the Gaiety Theater, within walking distance to all of the most popular restaurants and bars, as well as many attractions such as Dublin Castle and the Trinity College Library.",5,2019,07,21
204,"Professional facility, perfectly located","The hotel is a modern, sleek facility in the heart of the Dublin city core, right on St Stephens Green. Staff was friendly and addressed any issues we had professional and efficiently. Rooms were very nice - we had a lovely view of the park. ",4,2019,07,21
204,Expensive but genuine quality in best location,"Good buffet breakfast with multiple choices and a lot of things you could order from the menu. Honey direct from the honeycomb! Sometimes things would run out (for example the little bottles with interesting fresh juices and smoothies)and we had to ask, but new supplies came up very quickly. Lots of greeters and waiters, with every kind of accent you can imagine, eager to help if sometimes a bit confused about the food (there was a grilled fish on the menu daily but they didn't know what kind ... it was tasty anyway)

The space for breakfast was very noisy, however. The groovy design of the hotel created a half-mezzanine overlooking the lobby, but the ceiling is low and the sound of booming voices (everyone having a good time) was sometimes deafening

Concierge service was excellent - instant advice about restaurants, theatre, transport, etc.

Birthday fruit & cake plate, orchids waiting for us in the room. First night slightly disturbed by disco noise from underneath, but they took care of it quickly and sent another plate to apologize

The little balcony overlooking Stephen's Green was a treat - even if you had to clamber over a window sill to reach it

 · Some maintenance issues with the bathroom fittings - safety handle over the bath and the tap over the washbasin were wobbly, and the water outlet plugs didn't work well

Would have liked a better map of the city - concierge only had a tacky touristic one showing pubs, on cheap shiny paper that fell apart",5,2019,07,19
204,Amazing location ,"The location is amazing as it’s located right next to St Stephen Green and Grafton Street which has lots of food and shopping. 

Rooms are well furnished, clean and very modern with Diptique bath sets. The breakfast was great as it consisted of a small cold food bar with a hot menu to order food off. This reduces food waste and is definitely more environmentally friendly. Lobby bar was great and we had great recommendations from the staff.

Highly recommend this place for Dublin visitors. ",5,2019,07,17
204,Beware if you’re staying only one night,"The elevator does not go to the top!  It stops at floor five. The sixth floor is where guests only staying one night are relegated. Smaller rooms. TV doesn’t work. Unplugged refrigerator. But the hotel has the effrontery to charge the full rate as if you were staying in the larger well equipped rooms. I learned about the sixth floor being used for one night guests in the busy season from the duty manager when I checked out. I experienced a comedy of errors regarding room service and when I called to complain it was dealt with appropriately by comping my dinner. But when I mentioned the lack of a working tv and refrigerator the staff somehow didn’t seem surprised and didn’t apologize. It is my conjecture that the small rooms in the sixth floor are deliberately left ‘unplugged ‘ being used primarily for one night guests who probably won’t bother to write a review. When I mentioned Trip Advisor the person checking me out fumbled a bit and reduced the rate for my stay. Notwithstanding that, I am writing this to let people know about this peculiar situation at this “5 star” hotel. I had also booked my last night in Ireland at the Fitzwilliam and was curious about the room and level of service. I was given a regular room. No complaints. But nothing special. Not for almost $500!",2,2019,07,17
204,Amazing Experience,"We just stayed at the Fitzwilliam and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is in a great location, centrally located but also quiet. The staff was really friendly and helpful and the breakfast is delicious. Kevin, the restaurant manger, was so helpful to us, providing some great ideas for our trip from Westport to Galway. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,07,16
204,A CLASSY HOTEL THAT'S PROFESSIONALLY RUN !,"From, the moment we pulled up at the door on Saturday last the door staff were attentive, friendly and helpful  , we went to reception and was checked in  and welcomed back  by with the friendly efficient and bubbly Polina  , we have our favourite rooms in the hotel and she had already  allocated one of those   we love a quiet room  In our room was a lovely welcome back message .  That evening we went to the bar and had some drinks and was served by Aaron and Luke  - both were so friendly and helpful as we wanted a cocktail that was not on the menu and we had it before here and they made it up and was so happy to do so.  We ventured out for dinner and returned to the bar and was welcomed back again by Aaron and Luke who even offered to take our drinks to the lobby , excellent service .The next morning  we were welcomed back once again by the most gracious and engaging Kevin as we arrived down for breakfast,  we had yet once again the outstanding breakfast with such an incredible buffet that this hotel has to offer as well as the cooked breakfast which are always cooked to order e.g. the French toast and full Irish to name just a few options . We were served by Kevin and Majeic  -  efficient  friendly , bubbly a credit to the hotel and who love their jobs   On our check out we were looked after by Laura again so friendly and Martin the Porter offered to take my luggage to the car  in the basement saving me some time  - this is what you call 5 STAR SERVICE . I can't say enough on how wonderful my experience was  , simply bliss ... Staff make a hotel and this hotel the staff are exceptional .  I'm back again this Saturday night and look forward already . The Fitzwilliam comes highly recommended .",5,2019,07,15
204,Outstanding Accommodations in the City Center,Our stay was amazing.  Our family of three enjoyed spacious accommodations with nightly turn down service.  The bathroom was well stocked and beautiful.  Very quiet hotel even though it is right off Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green.  You cannot beat the location as it is central to so many things.  The concierge was incredibly helpful and the wait staff - especially Marcej - is a class act.  Breakfast was enjoyable with so many delicious options.  Indulge in afternoon tea - a must.  Our highest recommendations!,5,2019,07,15
204,Terrific location and terrific concierge,"We stayed for four nights recently.  It’s a wonderful location that is so close to everything. The restaurant was quite good and the staff were lovely.  The best bough were the concierges.  Patrick and Luka I particularly remember. They greet you whenever you pass through, check on how you are doing, have great ideas and suggestions and make sure everything is going well. When we needed ice they made sure we had it whenever we went up to our room.  R ally good attention.",5,2019,07,13
204,Incredibly helpful staff,Could not have had any better support and assistance from the staff during our stay at the Fitzwilliam.  It is in a great location in the heart of Dublin but is still in a quite and clean area.  Highly recommended hotel.      ,5,2019,07,12
204,Great stay in Dublin,"My 22 yo daughter and I spent 5 nights at the Fitzwilliam, during a very busy holiday weekend.  Our original room was a Superior Queen overlooking St. Stephens Green. After 2 nights and a long day trip to Wicklow, we agreed we needed 2 beds!  The front desk staff went above and beyond to accommodate us, even though the hotel was so busy.  They found us a room with 2 twin beds overlooking the center courtyard, and it suited us perfectly!  The location of the hotel was fantastic, and we walked to almost everything.  We did not eat at the hotel, but the lovely bartenders took care of us when we needed a night cap to bring back to our room!  As many reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is in need of a refreshing of the decor.  The carpets and furniture are showing their age, but that said everything was clean and in working order.  They also need to update the rooms to have better outlet access as well as USB ports.  The lack of USB ports in the rooms was surprising.",4,2019,07,11
204,Delightful stay!,"1. Beautiful room.
2. Very good staff! Very very helpful.
3. Clean with all amenities.
4. Room service will give complimentary chocolate everyday.
5. Extremely close to the Grafton street: full of life and street performances.
6. In a very good location to walk around and explore.",5,2019,07,11
204,Amazing staff,"Hi, 

I had dinner at your fine hotel last night and was superbly looked after by Peter and Klaton. 

I also met Julia on reception who was just so wonderfully helpful. 

10/10 guys, a masterclass in customer service. 

Kind regards, 

Darragh",5,2019,07,11
204,Great Hotel ,We stayed here over the July 4th weekend. The staff is most friendly and helpful. Breakfast is efficient and good.Concierge services were excellent. I stay in hotels about 150 nights a year and this is a terrific find.,5,2019,07,07
204,A lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam!,"I so enjoyed the wonderful staff as well as the amazing location of this hotel. Everyone was cheerful and helpful, the breakfast staff in particular were just fabulous. The hotel is right across from a beautiful park and within walking distance of some of the best spots in Dublin! I definitely think I'll be staying again. ",5,2019,07,03
204,Location is good,"Good location.  Convenient to shopping, sites, etc, but hotel is dated and worn.  Needs updating and renovation. Clean but furniture, carpet, etc is worn out.  Hallways to the rooms are dark and almost scary. ",3,2019,07,03
204,Road teio,We loved this hotel. We stayed here on the last night of a 10 day whirlwind trip. We were exhausted and tired of walking. We checked into the hotel and we were treated very well. All of the best sites are right outside the hotel. We were able to enjoy or last night in a  fun part  of town and walk back with no problems. We had a very early flight the next morning and they packed us a take away breakfast. Mine was gluten free too. I would stay here again. ,5,2019,07,02
204,Amazing service and location ,We stayed two night in room 508 which is a room with terrace and it is fantastic. Extremely spacious and large bathrooms. I would say extra large for European standards. The included buffet breakfast is delicious and includes a cold buffet and hot dishes to order. The staff could not be friendlier and the location in Dublin cannot be beat. Almost everything is walking distance. I highly recommend. ,5,2019,06,30
204,Great Room,I stayed here with my husband on business. The service as we entered the hotel was excellent and we were even shown our room personally by the receptionist which was a nice touch. The room itself was lovely - really good for a city centre room in terms of size. The decor modern and stylish. The one thing that let the hotel down was the level of service during breakfast. We had to ask for things a couple of times which wasn't ideal and not in keeping with the five star vibe of the rest of the hotel. Hence my 4 out of 5. Other than that all good!,4,2019,06,30
204,Amazing Staff,"Costco Travel booked us into the fitzwilliam hotel, but I couldn't have asked for a better place! It was lovely and charming, the staff were fantastic and went out of their way for us. It is situated right next to a gorgeous park and a step away from Grafton Street with loads of pubs and shopping. We loved it!",5,2019,06,30
204,An oasis in the city center,It shows that the staff is well trained. That type of hospitality and service starts at the top. From the minute we walked in we were made to feel special. I liked being shown to the room ( it was the manager who took us up and he was extremely kind).,5,2019,06,28
204,Exceptional and Exceeded Expectations,Friendly efficient and well groomed staff in all contact areas. Always willing to please. Rooms larger than expected. Super bathroom with great bathtub. Breakfast was solid as was the bar and specialty restaurant ,5,2019,06,28
204,Highest level of customer service,"While attending a conference in the hotel I had the pleasure of enjoying a coffee in the bar and was served by Malgorzata (Gosia). A lovely warm welcome and excellent coffee. Meeting room, equipment and all personnel who looked after us were exceptional. Would strongly recommend. ",5,2019,06,27
204,"One of the best locations in Dublin city, beside Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green","This is city centre Hotel super location, staff very friendly, helpful, all around the Hotel from parking your car to the breakfast and dining, really great guys, keep it up. Room was nice size and very comfortable and clean, rear view to artificial garden.",4,2019,06,19
204,Loved this hotel!!,Beautiful hotel...very clean and rooms are spacious and comfortable!! All the staff are very  helpful & friendly!! Walking distance to all the shopping and attractions!! I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again on my next visit!! ,5,2019,06,17
204,Tired and expensive,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a 2 night business trip.

The hotel is tired - wood fixtures and wall trimmings look worn out from use, as do the window shades. The ""gym"" is a converted guest room with 2 treadmills.  The breakfast is nothing to write home about, either - I stuck to granola.

Dublin seems to have a shortage of hotel rooms at the moment, which is leading to a massive surge in hotel costs. For 280EUR/night, the Fitzwilliam certainly did not deliver quality that is worthy of such a cost.",3,2019,06,16
204,The Staff are Exceptional,"We visited for a quick weekend away for Taste of Dublin and Bon Jovi. The hotel location is fantastic, breakfast is outstanding and the staff are exceptional. Every single member of the team, regardless of position, provided us with 5 star smiles & service at all times. We loved it.",5,2019,06,16
204,Disappointing smelly old hotel,"We visited Dublin this month as part of our anniversary celebrations and while we were  really impressed by the city and hospitality overall, our choice of the Fitzwilliam Hotel was probably our biggest disappointment.

From the time of check in, when we entered a room with dirty cleaning rags still sitting on the bathroom floor to our lackluster checkout, I couldn’t find a thing good to say about the hotel and our stay.

Exhausted from our flights, our first night was interrupted by guests down the hallway partying. With the paper thin walls, we became part of their celebration and had a restless first night, made worse by the tired old pillows.

Breakfast was also a disappointment too, with the myriads of service staff more interested in getting their own coffee than that of the hotel guests. 

Finally complaining about the terrible moldy stench in our room, we were eventually offer to move to a cleaner room but four days into our stay it was too little too late for me.

During our week we visited a number of other hotels in the area, all of which offer non-house guests much better hospitality than that we received at the Fitzwilliam. So we certainly will make one of these our first choice on our next visit.",2,2019,06,16
204,The rating does NOT reflect this property,"We arrived for a one night stay in Dublin. Already the entrance does not appear as a five star hotel. Our room was not as agreed upon and reflected a serious downgrade, despite our voucher with a picture of said room. My husband and I NEVER stay in a room with one chair, 40 years we stay in a room with a double seating area or a sofa,as we spend time in our room, always. The voucher (for this 400 and something dollar room) said 34 meters...that’s a large room, this room was tiny, maybe 20 meters. Then, the PIECE DE RESISTANCE, the bed! A bed for one person. Maybe it was a twin, maybe not, all I know is that two people our age cannot both sleep in something so tiny.  So we never slept really, we had no place to sit, the window was broken upon our arrival..and although they tried to appease us with chocolate etc, basically it was a very sad end to a beautiful vacation. And, it was the eve of our 42nd anniversary.",2,2019,06,16
204,a two star hotel with a 5 star price,"Let me start by saying that the location and concierge staff at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin are terrific.  And that’s where the positive ends.  My husband and I are very frequent travelers and have stayed in cities on 6 continents over the last 45 years.  Sometimes we stay in 3 star hotels, and sometimes in 5 stars.  Generally the cost is commensurate with the stars, as would be expected.  But this was definitely NOT the case with the Fitzwilliam.  We were there for two nights and paid 489 Euros per night, more than we are accustomed to paying even at 5 star hotels in what are known to be expensive cities.  

What we found, instead of the expected luxury, was a room that probably was never very nice (as evidenced by a shower so small that my elbows kept banging into the walls, a soap dish too small to accommodate shampoo and soap, and  no hook to put a wet towel other than on top of the robes ).  
 
Time has not been kind to the room.  There was mold in all four corners of the shower, the cheap furniture was very badly nicked, the drawers did not close correctly.  There was bird poop on the window that could have been fresh, but more likely given the state of the room, had been there for some time.  At first, I thought that perhaps just our room needed to be renovated, but then I noticed the same kind of wear and tear on the furniture in the lobby.  
 
This is a Preferred Hotel.  I would have expected a lot more from a hotel with that stamp of approval.",2,2019,06,15
204,Very good both in service and location ,"We reached Dublin in the middle of June, and winter welcomed us.
We got to the hotel, immediately had been guided to the room.
Very convenient with a cool terrace for 2.
Breakfast is very good, and includes any type of dish you might require.
Also fresh juices. A real treat.
Service is very good ,
And location very central for shoppers , runners ( a beautiful park in front)
Bottom line
We loved Dublin ",4,2019,06,14
204,Awesome,"My husband and I stayed here during our trip to Dublin! One of the highlights was this hotel! Stand out service by everyone that works here made it wonderful! Especially Dane that planned a whole day for us with ease, professionalism and personality! Much appreciated!",5,2019,06,14
204,Amazing Stay,We stayed here one night after driving all over Ireland. We have stayed at multiple hotels in Dublin but this is the best. Sorry Metallica and Spice Girls you should have stayed here. This is a great place to stay. The accommodations were 5 star and so was the staff. Anything we needed the staff was immediately on it with a smile. This is a great location across from the park and close enough to the stadium for a reasonable cab fair. I would highly recommend staying here.,5,2019,06,12
204,BEST HOTEL IN EUROPE,"Everyone was very helpful and friendly.
Great Location on St. Stephen's green and Grafton Street.
Wonderful food and a fabulous breakfast.
Great beds and bed linens.
We had a delicious high tea.
The wait staff was friendly and very helpful
especially since I am handicap.
We would come back in a second. 
",5,2019,06,05
204,Great Dublin Hotel,Upscale modern boutique style hotel close to Dublin's shopping and dining areas. Across the street from St Stephen's green with good access to transportation. All of the is very accommodating. Very clean. ,5,2019,06,04
204,Quiet oasis,"Very central location
Staff very pleasant
Bathrooms a bit dated
Air conditioning in need of attention 
Breakfast was good - cooked to order
Very quiet setting not aware of traffic although it is in the centre of the city

",3,2019,06,03
204,Perfect place to stay,"Had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam. Convenient location, room quite and very nice, helpful staff, fantastic breakfast, and within easy walking distance of shops, pubs, and bus lines which are a convenient way to see local attractions. Would stay in the same place if in Dublin again.",5,2019,06,01
204,First trip to Dublin,Wonderful first class hotel off Grafton . A bit pricey for a Dublin hotel buy worth it. The hotel was located in the best part of Dublin as far as accessibility to all attractions. My room over looked St. Stephens Park which was an added attraction. The rooms were small but well appointed. ,5,2019,06,01
204,"Place was great, staff was the best!!!!","Everything was great, they are so helpful with tours and places to go.  Patrick was the best!!!  Would definitely stay here again and recommend the place.  They made our trip even better and breakfast was really good.  ",5,2019,05,31
204,Great night at the Fitzwilliam,"We arrived back in Dublin for one night prior to our flight.  We got lost trying to find the front of the hotel due to one way streets.  My husband knew we were close and walked to the hotel to ask.  One of the doormen came with him back to the car to ride with us and show us the way.  Such service!!!! The hotel is modern hidden on the famous St. Stephen's Green.  Fabulous location, close to Grafton St. and Trinity College.  We had to leave prior to breakfast.  The staff had a take away breakfast bag for each of us in the am.  The room was comfortable, clean, nicely appointed.",5,2019,05,31
204,Fitzwilliam is a must!,"Great location on St Stephen's  Green. Comfortable beds, great bar and food. Concierge service was so helpful for our group of 14 friends traveling together! Patrick was a rock star! He assisted us with reservations, transportation and finding our way through Dublin and beyond.",5,2019,05,31
204,Great location,"Other than an odd smell on the second floor the hotel was nice, friendly, and in a great location to get on the public transportation or walk. I didn’t try the bar or breakfast. The help desk was good at getting us directions. ",3,2019,05,30
204,Larry,"We had an excellent two-day stay at The Fitzwilliam. Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The location is outstanding. The staff was very efficient and friendly. Nice bar in the lobby for a nightcap. Definitely upgrade your reservation to include the breakfast (20euro pp), the menu/buffet meal is amazing.",5,2019,05,28
204,Not Very Special & Very Expensive,Excellent location. Strange decor. Concierge and reception staff frequently missing and not too helpful when they appear. Certainly not up to the standard of the rating it has. Very expensive for something which is not very special.,1,2019,05,28
204,Excellent!,"Great hotel with excellent service and the best location. So, it's not cheap but  the convenience and comfort make the money worth it for me. I was in Dublin for 12 days and there were times that it was a bit rainy and it was pleasant to be in the room or lobby during that time. The location can't be beat-right on St. Stephen's Green and near the Grafton Street area. ",5,2019,05,27
204,Awesome access to everything!,We had a room with a balcony and it was a relaxing way to start and end our day. The shops and pubs are all within walking distance and concierge  is always willing to help schedule a taxi or book tickets to one of the local museums. ,5,2019,05,26
204,Great location - Bad Service,"Room could be a bit more updated considering it is a 5 star hotel, but overall everything was great until we interacted with the overnight person at reception. We came back to the hotel around 11:30pm and asked the man working at the front desk for bottles of water to be brought up to our room. He insisted that we had to get them from the bar and insinuated that we were lazy because we wanted them to be brought up to our room. The water never arrived so I went downstairs to get water from the bar and this man continued to argue with me for about 5 minutes. I explained that this was not what I had expected from a 5 star hotel and that I had experienced much better service at 3 and 4 star hotels.  Instead of just saying sorry about the miscommunication and handing me the bottles of water, he insisted that his attitude was in alignment with 5 star service, and continued on until I finally just walked away from him and got on the elevator. When we checked out in the morning I spoke with two women who seemed very shocked at the situation and insisted that he would be spoken to about the incident. They offered us free breakfast, but we did not have time to stay. Considering we spent over 250$ per night, I was fairly shocked that we were not offered money back or even a voucher to stay at another hotel in the future. If we were offered something else, since we could not stay I would have felt that they were truly sorry for what had happened, instead I feel like nothing will be done about how we were treated and that the Fitzwilliam Hotel does not care.

Really not satisfied with the level of service at this hotel and definitely will not be returning.",1,2019,05,20
204,Excellent Hotel in a Great Location,"This s one of the most accommodating hotels I have had the pleasure of staying.  From the moment we walked in to the moment we checked out everything was taken care of.  The front desk was very friendly and the concierge anticipated everything we needed before we had to ask: taking care of our luggage, where to eat, calling us a cab on check out.  The breakfast was amazing.  Very well-prepared food with good service to match.  The room and hotel was spotless and the water pressure was great.  The air conditioning worked very well.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept the whole night through.  

The location is perfect:  across from a beautiful park and walking distance to many of Dublin's historical sites.  If you need to do any shopping, there is plenty of choices less than a block away.  I would absolutely recommend this place for anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2019,05,20
204,Wonderful Hotel,"Lovely hotel in a fantastic location.  Rooms are nice we all amenities you would expect.  Breakfast is amazing, freshly cooked hot food and lovely buffet.  Everything you would expect from a 5* hotel.  What you don't expect are the amazing friendly and helpful staff they really go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful.  We loved every minute!",5,2019,05,20
204,Lovely hotel and location,The Fitzwillam Hotel is located in the best spot to see Dublin city. The room was cozy and the view of St Stephens Green was perfect. You definitely will love the breakfast and serving staff. The room was clean and very comfortable. The bathtub was an added pleasure,5,2019,05,18
204,Great Hotel,"I travel the world, and I can’t recall a better experience than The Fitzwilliam. Great location, great staff. The bar is a great place to grab a drink and relax. The concierge service is fantastic. Enjoy!",5,2019,05,18
204,Treated like royalty,"I suppose the best compliment a hotel could receive is that they felt like home.  Well, I’m rarely treated this well, even at home. The staff are exceptional, the accommodations luxurious, and the breakfast was scrumptious. Perfectly situated across from a beautifully park and adjacent to the trendiest walking district, the Fitzwilliam exemplified this city’s well deserved reputation for openness and solicitude. Thank you for a wonderful experience. ",5,2019,05,15
204,Friendly service,"Absolutely loved the breakfast with a generous menu of hot food in addition to the buffet. It was more than enough food to keep me full of energy the whole day until dinner.  Service is very good and friendly and superb location for shopping or sightseeing. It is starting to show some age (eg in bathroom and scratched cabinets) so as a 5-star design hotel, it isn’t perfect but definitely recommend a stay if you can get a good rate.  Also they offer a special prix-fixed menu at Glover’s alley for hotel guests.  It’s a good deal and the food is very nice.",4,2019,05,12
204,"Ideal location, fantastically staffed.","This was our first trip to Ireland, and we spent our first four days in Dublin, staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was a fantastic choice.
Located directly across the street from the lush, historic, and Victorian St. Stephen's Green, the hotel places you with-in easy walking distance of all the Dublin highlights: Trinity College where you see The Book of Kells is a considerably less-than-ten minutes stroll via mostly pedestrianized streets filled with buskers and good shopping and of course many many pubs. We were able to walk to the Hugh Lane to see Francis Bacon's reconstructed studio in about 20 easy minutes. To get to more far-flung sites, the Hop-On/Hop-Off buses have a stop a half block away.
We stayed here these first nights of our trip, and then returned for one evening on last night, (the hotel is also just about a 40 minutes taxi from the airport without traffic), so we saw two separate rooms of the same category. We were on the fifth floor with a terraced room overlooking the Green. We HIGHLY suggest you ask for one of these rooms if it fits your budget. Our two rooms were each unique to each other, with very different layouts, but equalled each other in comfort. Great beds and towels! In one room our bed faced the window overlooking the park and had a windowless (but well HVACed) en suite. The other had a huge window in the oversized bathroom and I took a great bath there simply because I could, and despite the fact that i am more a shower guy.
While waiting for our driver to pick us up for the trip to Galway, (a great driver found for us by the hotel concierge), we were chatting with one of the doorman, Mr. John Byrne. When he heard our destination he told us he had a friend who grew up in Galway, ""loves his City and enjoys showing it off"", and said he would give him a call to see if he was around and if he was free to meet us for a walk that evening if we were interested in him arranging that. We were. Mr. Byrne completely kept his word, and we received a message that afternoon at our Galway hotel. We met up with his genial friend, and walked around Galway for about two hours with him; learning Galway's history and having notable landmarks pointed out. Fantastic experience!!! Here's the thing, money was never discussed nor requested. Naturally, we gave the guy a tip (!) but it was remarkable to me that what Mr. Byrne had arranged for us was not a business trade-off but simply a gesture of sincere kindness.
I feel the above tale best sums up the Fitzwilliam; they welcome you sincerely and go above and beyond for their guests. And truly, you cannot be in a better locale for exploring Dublin.",5,2019,05,12
204,Great location good facilities ,"Stayed on business for one night. Location is great as you are right in the best part of town, the staff are friendly and the rooms are good. Bathroom was a little tired in places but the bed was very comfortable with good linen. For the price I would have expected a slightly higher standard. ",4,2019,05,12
204,In bad need of a face lift. ,"Stayed here as a couple for just one night for a “special rate” of 345 euros including breakfast. You can’t fault the hotel’s location but the place is dark and shabby and in much need of a face lift. 
Our shower didn’t drain properly and the handle of the WC cistern was rickety. It broke completely the morning of our departure so we had to use the public toilets in the basement. 
The staff were all friendly and helpful. The cooked breakfast was good but the breakfast area, on the mezzanine level, was cramped and I suspect that they would struggle to cope if the hotel was full. 
All in all, a very disappointing stay. There are plenty of better hotels in Dublin that are less expensive. This does not feel like a five star hotel. ",3,2019,05,12
204,Great Stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin,We had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The rooms are spacious and clean. We were able to exchange Dollars for Euros at the Reception counter with a decent exchange rate.,5,2019,05,11
204,Fitzwilliam,"Staff was welcoming, friendly and ready to assist. 
Location in city made it convenient to locations we 
wanted to visit.  Pubs, museums, cultural were easily in walking distance. 
Will definitely return on next trip to Dublin. ",5,2019,05,11
204,Great stay,Great stay was apparent despite playing golf in the worst weather ever which has nothing to do with the hotel.  Meals were great service was wonderful.   Room was clean.  Staff was very helpful.  We never had any problems ,5,2019,05,11
204,"Good location, no elevator","Great location.
We were on the top floor and there was no elevator.
The breakfast was good and the staff was very helpful.
The shower was very poor and the toilet didn't work properly.
Beds were comfortable.",3,2019,05,07
204,"Nice hotel, excellent staff and good location.","We expected a litlebit more luxurious room because of price and stars. We change our room with  dubble bed for twin bed. Our friends who had dubble bed found it to small for two persons. Our room was quite with view on local company offices.
Now, staff and cleanliness 
and breakfast are excellent how it should be in 5 stars hotel. Hotel is located in central part of Dublin, walking distance to all places that you will visit in the city.",4,2019,05,07
204,Excellent Stay,"Excellent hotel with great amenities and service! Close to everything including great restaurants. Concierge services were great helping arrange everything in Dublin, including some amazing restaurant recommendations.",5,2019,05,07
204,Weekend stay May 2019,"Great rooms, very comfortable beds. Concierge brilliant booking restaurants and getting a hire ca delivered to the hotel. Could not have done more. Only downside is bar is completely empty and therefore has no atmosphere and is uninviting. Not a problem given location and proximity of endless alternatives but a shame. ",5,2019,05,07
204,Service...Service....Service...,"While the hotel sells itself in regards to location (end of Grafton Street), its the service that will make you glad you stayed.  Patrick, Head Concierge, knows every restaurant in Dublin and will make the best suggestions.  Sit with Lewis at the bar and have a great conversation about whiskeys and gins...his knowledge is insanely good.  Will be back because of the service level.  The rooms are spacious and will be going thru a refresh in the next months....while it doesn't necessarily need - its always nice to give a fresh touch.",5,2019,05,06
204,Business trip with some pleasure,"I've been staying at this property when in Dublin for years.  Excellent location, along the Green and at the top of Grafton.  Patrick and colleagues at the concierge desk are friendly, pleasant, and efficient.  The rooms are clean and nice.  Bathrooms could use some updating, but they are large enough. Room service leaves something to be desired but it's a chance to get out of the hotel room and try restaurants nearby.  All service staff are friendly and professional.  Have already made reservations for my next two trips.  ",5,2019,05,06
204,Great stay,"Had 1 night  in Belfast and we read the reviews and chose the Fitzwilliam hotel. What a great choice for us. Great location, convenient to many many things. Walkable to many sites and restaurants and bars. The concierge staff were very helpful and extra friendly. The check in was really nice. The room itself was a bit small but otherwise luxurious. I would highly recommend to travelers to Belfast.",5,2019,05,05
204,Beautiful centrally located hotel,"After a 6.5 hour flight, and learning to drive from the opposite side of the road and car, it was wonderful to stay at the Fitzwilliam. We were warmly greeted by the gentlemen at the door, our luggage was brought in, and our car parked in a secure facility. We were allowed to check in early, and our luggage was brought to the room by an outstanding young man. After getting situated, we walked across the street to enjoy the beauty of the park. It had began to rain a bit, so we returned to the hotel for directions to the Guinness Storehouse and Jameson's tour. The doorman graciously hailed us a taxi and made sure that he knew where we were going. Upon return, the gents offered suggestions a pub for a pint and dinner. We ended up choosing The Hairy Lemon based on their recommendations, and found it delightful. If you want excellence, this is your place. Thank you!!",5,2019,05,04
204,Great experience,"The hotel is centrally located and you can walk everywhere.  The staff at the hotel was amazing, specially the concierge services.  There is a public train station across the street from the hostal that can take you all over the city.  I will stay with them for my next visit.  ",5,2019,05,04
204,Clean and beautiful place!,"Wonderful place! Very convenient location next to shops, restaurants and pubs. I had a red eye flight coming in and they were able to accommodate my early check in and it really made a big impression and difference!",5,2019,05,02
204,"Wonderful stay, central location","We stayed here for a weekend visit to Dublin. It was such a perfect hotel, from the moment we stepped through the door. 

Room decor was lovely and comfortable - we had a room that overlooked the garden at the back so was really quiet. The shower was excellent and they provide Diptyque toiletries along with slippers and dressing gown. 

Breakfast was included as part of our package and although at times they seemed to be short staffed, they never got our order wrong and provided an efficient service, with plenty of choice. 

Would stay here again in a heartbeat if I could!",5,2019,04,29
204,Outstanding location and service.,"Only in Dublin for two days and the Fitzwilliam allowed us to maximize the time.  Walking distance to important museums, historic sights and a mix of fine restaurants and pubs.  It rained constantly but failed to dampen our spirits.  the hotel facilities are modern when we prefer old, however, the efficiency and comfort made up for a lack of character.  Not a good idea to walk behind the hotel where the neighborhood, though safe, is made up of affordable housing.  We would stay at the hotel again and recommend to our friends.  There might be less expensive accommodations, possibly not as comfortable.",5,2019,04,28
204,Wonderful short stay,"No complaints of any kind. The receptionist was friendly as was the concierge service. Very good recommendation for local food outlets. As our visit was rather short, the hop-on tour was a good guide to the city with its historical background. Good job all and thank you for the very friendly services

",5,2019,04,28
204,Treated like Royalty at the Fitzwilliam!,"From the moment you pull up outside the Fitzwilliam, you are made feel like. The most important guest there! We were staying on an overnight theatre break and chose the Fitzwilliam for its proximity to the Gaeity theatre.  Initially we had planned to get something in the bar before hand but went with the Pretheatre dinner in their fine dining restaurant Glovers, excellent value at €35 for 2 courses and €40 for three which includes a free glass of proccecco and multiple treats as well!. I would recommend the pretheatre dinner to anyone in Dublin on a night out ! The Fitzwilliam Hotel is an oasis of calm nestled in the city and a hotel I will return too.",5,2019,04,28
204,Excellent as always,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week with the family.
From booking with Fergal till check out was a pleasure.
Great location, comfortable clean rooms with great service.
Went for breakfast one morning & could not fault.
Looking foward to our next visit.",5,2019,04,25
204,Best in Dublin!  Great location!,Had a fantastic time. Staff was very attentive and friendly!  Will definitely stay again!  I hope to visit again in the near future. We had a wonderful visit and such caring staff!  Hope we get as great service in the future. ,5,2019,04,24
204,Best Honeymoon Ever,"Every staff member was accommodating with any and every need. The service staff and fun and knowledgeable. The concierge is always smiling as you walk in or out and willing to help you with anything. The rooms are very comfortable and relaxing. It is a great location for tourists and non. You can walk through St. Stevens Green Park rain or shine, and it is beautiful. It’s very centrally located around many restaurants and pubs.",5,2019,04,23
204,Amazing staff—nicest people you’ll ever meet!,"Maybe it’s in the water, but this hotel staff, to a person, is happy and upbeat and their enthusiasm is contagious.  Make sure to get the wonderful breakfast and start your day right!  We loved everything about our stay. ",5,2019,04,23
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin Ireland,Enjoyed staying there so much. Loved the turn-down service at night (they brought us chocolates every evening!). The location was excellent-easy to walk to most of the museums and historical sites. Staff was extremely helpful and gracious-food is wonderful. Really enjoyed our stay.,5,2019,04,22
204,ideal,"this was the perfect place to stay in dublin!

it's barely noticeable from the street but the inside is all modern luxury with the staff to match.  

you can't beat the location, right next to grafton st & st. stephen's green.  it was quiet but still within walking distance of great food, shops & tourist sights.  

one of the many things i truly love about ireland?  breakfast is always included & the fitzwilliiam's was quite good.  i would avoid the avocado toast & go for the full irish if i were you.  

i hope to return soon!",5,2019,04,22
204,Exceptional Dublin hotel experience,"The fitzwilliam hotel was the perfect choice for our business trip from the USA. We only had 2 days in Dublin, at the beginning and end of our trip and this hotel went above and beyond expectations. Great location, walking distance to everything important, exceptional staff, and very comfortable rooms.",5,2019,04,22
204,Very happy with our stay!,"Very happy with our stay in the fitzwilliam, very welcoming from the minute we arrived. The lady that checked us in kindly walked with is to show us our room which was great. The gentlemen on the door we're very friendly and always offered to help with our bags. The car park was very handy as its part of the hotel. Location is fantastic its right across from stephens green. All round the perfect place to stay for anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2019,04,22
204,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful service","We had a lovely stay. The location on St. Stephen’s Green was perfect. Accommodations were very nice, and the service was too-notch. All of the staff were so friendly and attentive. We can’t wait to come back!",5,2019,04,21
204,Very Pleasant and passionate staff ,"I am very impressed by the pleasant attitude of this hotel’s staff.  

At the concierge desk, to restaurant staff, bell boys... everyone of them are so friendly, helpful and even with the extra miles of service we were provided, we find our stay here very comfortable and warm.  

Both Patrick and Dane at the concierge are wonderful.  Super friendly and resourceful with good suggestions of restaurants.  The other staff at the breakfast restaurant were very responsive too.

The bedroom and the hotel decoration overall is regarded as oldish style for me.  Room and bathroom are rather small.  But facilities inside the room are sufficient.  There’s a balcony inside my room but over looking to the interior of rooms opposite to us.  Hence if you want to have some privacies, you have to keep the blinds down.

This hotel is very well located centrally.  Walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar, Grafton Street for shopping.  Close to The Little Museum of Dublin.  

As the hotel interior isn’t charming to me, so I didn’t take any photos to upload for you.

Thanks for giving us a good first impression of Dublin with your warm hospitality.",5,2019,04,19
204,Great centrally located hotel,"This hotel is right in the center of everything. We walked to most attractions. It’s also very close to a taxi stand, buses and trains. Our room was very quite and clean. If I had to complain about anything it would be that the shampoo, conditioner and body lotion they provide is heavily perfumed. The concierge was very helpful and recommended some out standing dinner options for us. Breakfast was really good too.   ",5,2019,04,17
204,Reasonable fPrice and GREAT location or Nice Dublin accommodations,"There are no great deals to be had in terms of downtown Dublin hotels, and I would describe the Fitzwilliam as not unreasonable. We paid $300 per night for an entry-level room with breakfast. The room was cute, and the hotel,  stylish. The check-in was quite smooth and the concierge knowledgeable and helpful. Breakfast was fine, but the quality of service was sketchy on the one day it was crowded. When we ate toward the end of the breakfast window on a different day- it was fabulous though. Hot freshly prepared breakfast in addition to a cold european-style buffet. Our location was IDEAL, and while the hotel was starting to show some minor signs of wear, it was worth the price and I would stay again.",4,2019,04,16
204,Second time back - won’t be the last! ,"We were so blown away by our stay here a year ago we decided to treat ourselves and return. 
This time we knew what to expect so we were a little afraid it wouldn’t be as good as the first time. 

We shouldn’t have worried. 
The staff are really lovely, and very down to earth for a five star hotel. When you arrive you treated like you matter. 

The rooms are so comfortable. Ours was a little on the small side but it didn’t matter because it was so fresh and clean and comfortable. I still dream about the bed. 

Breakfast is one of the best we’ve ever had. The choice is exceptional, the staff are busy but so attentive and lovely. 

Location is amazing, grafting street is on your doorstep, literally. 

Price wise it is expensive but for a treat it’s so worth it. 
",5,2019,04,15
204,Nice !,"We really enjoyed our escape at Fitzwilliam Dublin. Great location, good service, cosy rooms (however some slight maintenance / renovation could be done. Great breakfast. I recommend this hotel despite a price quite expensive. ",5,2019,04,11
204,Excellent Hotel,"I can’t say enough about this hotel, from the welcome we received at the front door from Patrick and Dane to the sumptuous food in Glover’s Alley it was amazing.
Very talented chef is Andy and his food flavors and textures are sublime.
Great Batman from Wales who is an encyclopedia of knowledge.
Top Class all round ",5,2019,04,10
204,Another Great Stay At The Fitzwilliam,"This is my 4th time staying at the Fitzwilliam. It's a great location and the staff are fast, efficient and pleasant. From check-in to check out they make everything easy. Everything you need in Dublin is right outside the front door or easily accessible from there. I'll be back! ",5,2019,04,09
204,Excellent location with excellent service,"We had a wonderful experience staying at the Fitzwilliam in April 2019.  The concierge staff was wonderful and gave us great tips/insight.  We hadn't prebooked tickets to the Kilmainham Gaol tour and were very disappointed to see they were sold out during our stay, but the concierge knowingly told us to keep checking, as tickets almost always come up...and they did!  They gave us great advice on how to get around the city and good sites to visit.  They even helped arrange for our rental car provider to pick our car up at the hotel rather than having us struggle to return it.  The room was very nicely decorated and laid out, the breakfast was delicious, and the location across the street from the park and central to all of the sites was perfect.  We wished we had more time at this hotel and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2019,04,08
204,Fantastic stay!,"Incredible service!! Every single person we encountered was so pleasant, outgoing & willing to help! Centrally located, walking distance to many locations. Will definitely recommend!! Lovely, lovely stay!!! ",5,2019,04,05
204,Sister weekend break! ,"My sister and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for two nights on 28th and 29th March. 

The best thing about our visit was by far the concierge, John Byrne.  What a great ambassador for Dublin he is; a real asset the the Fitzwilliam Hotel Group.   You would travel far in the world to get better than John.  Extremely knowledgeable and friendly, offering great tips for things to do and see in the city. 
Also special mention the the barman at Inn On the Green (sorry didn’t get his name - but he is from Cardiff).  Really nice chap. 

Our room was clean and spacious.   Tea coffee facilities were adequate - but no biscuits for a cup of tea? 

Car parking on site was very handy and reasonably priced for city centre.   

Location of the hotel was great - very central! 

Afternoon tea - really disappointing.  Was basically all little mousse/pate with nothing else.  A little sickly.  

Would return - we had a great time!  Thanks again to John and all the team.

204,Irish Gold (or purple),"Perfect place to stay while visiting Dublin.  Location can’t be beat.  Right on the park, next to shopping and so many good restaurants and pubs all within about 5 blocks.  From here you can walk to all the sites within 20 minutes.
Staff, some in their purple coats, make this place the best.  From doormen and front desk to wait staff and housekeepers all made our stay the best.  Food at breakfast was spot on.  Really good buffet and omelettes.  We stayed for 4 nights and everyone seemed to remember our names.
Towards the end of my stay I mentioned that some of the furnished had scratches and they told me they are starting a rooms refresh shortly.  Should be even better",5,2019,04,02
204,Superb,"Wonderful Property. Staff were pleasant and helpful, rooms have great decor , might not be everyone's taste but my partner and myself very much enjoyed it. very clean. breakfast was good, but dinner was just amazing. restaurant is just next to the hotel, not in breakfast room... but it was definitely best pork belly i have ever had. highly recommend. Fab hotel in heart of Dublin",5,2019,04,01
204,Service 5+,"From the moment we arrived it was clear that the team here are among the best we have experienced anywhere in the world. Professional, well trained and also very nice people making sure our stay went without a hitch. And of course the situation of the hotel could not be better for all the attractions in central Dublin.",5,2019,04,01
204,Dublin weekend,"We enjoyed a wonderful weekend in Dublin- the Guinness factory was great and the GPO visit really interesting! Fantastic stay at the Fitzwilliam, a beautiful hotel with excellent service! Would highly recommend it. ",5,2019,04,01
204,Negative,"Hotel in good position. 200 meters from center. Impossible opening windows, lack of air. 
Very poor breakfast for a five-star hotel. Better to go to the Westbury. This is a true 5 stars. Negative experience.",2,2019,03,31
204,One night break,"We had such a treatful stay. Breakfast in particular was incredible and kept us full until dinner 😁 Staff in the bar were very helpful and we tried a range of beautiful cocktails. 
All round, a fab stay 😍",5,2019,03,31
204,Hotel Stay.,First time staying in The Fitzwilliam. More expensive than I would normally pay for a hotel but clear to see what the extra gets you. Staff couldn't do enough for you. Food was excellent in the bar and for breakfast with a great choice for both. ,5,2019,03,31
204,Great stay,Great stay in the heart of Dublin . Staff was great and always very helpful (especially the doormen/concierge).  Breakfast was good with a wide variety of items. Definitely will stay again the next time we visit.,5,2019,03,31
204,Fabulous,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at your hotel. The attention to detail was notable. All staff we met were friendly and helpful, especially Laura at check in. She was a wealth of information and even showed us to our room. We would highly recommend your hotel to friends and family. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2019,03,29
204,Lovely Hotel with Beautiful Views of St. Stephen's Green,We loved our stay at the Fitzwilliam! We could see the swans in St. Stephen's green from the window of our room. The bathtub in the room was also exceptional. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. Will definitely be staying here again!,5,2019,03,28
204,Superb Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is an excellent hotel. The staff is so helpful and warm. The location can’t be beat- St Stephens Square is directly across the street and Grafton Street around the corner. By all means get the breakfast at the hotel- it is superb and a great value. I’ve been to Dublin many times, however, this trip was the best because of the Fitzwilliam. We will definitely stay there again!",5,2019,03,28
204,Great hotel in Dublin ,Just stayed at this property. Rooms very well outfitted and plenty of amenities. Staff is excellent. Front desk worked to insure we got our room early as we had just arrived from the states. Breakfast was one of the better experiences we ever had with the food and service beating expectations. Highly recommend!,5,2019,03,27
204,Great option ,The location is amazingly close to shopping (Grafton Street) and restaurants.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  My room had the garden view - lots of natural light.  The bathroom was good size and included the standard amenities ( including bath robes)—water pressure in the shower was amazing!   The only thing missing in the bathroom were outlets.   Not able to blow dry my hair in the bathroom.  Breakfast options were good and the staff accommodating.  Looking forward to a return visit.  ,4,2019,03,27
204,outstanding,this is a fantastic hotel is the prime location - you are close to shopping in dining. the service was outstanding and our room was very tastefully decorated. comfortable bed. excellent size bathroom with amazing diptyque products. without hesitation we will stay here again. this is a true 5* luxuries hotel.,5,2019,03,25
204,Amazing Hotel and great location,WE spent a week in Ireland at 3 hotels.  This was our last stay of two nights in Dublin and we absolutely loved it!  The staff was amazing and helpful in finding restaurants and tourists areas.  Wish we would have spent another night or two in Dublin and stayed here.  Location is great just across the street form Stephens Green and block away form Grafton street.  Breakfast was phenomenal and loved the fresh smoothies and Eggs Royale.  WE didn't even experience all the hotel and it had to offer.I would definitely stay here again when in Dublin!,5,2019,03,24
204,"FITZWILLIAM HOTEL Dublin, Ireland","Staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin during our stay in Ireland was an excellent choice!  It was especially busy in Dublin for St. Patrick’s Day, and being located at the Fitzwilliam gave us convenient opportunities to be in and near all of the festivities.  We were able to walk to all locations for food, fun, shopping and outdoor parks.  The train and bus drops were only a few steps from the hotel.  The room was very cozy, pleasant and attractive.  Our view of the courtyard was soothing and the purple lights at night were festive.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  We received chocolates every evening, plus homemade cookies on St. Patrick’s Day.  The breakfast was delicious every morning and opened early.  The concierge service was the best part of our stay.  They were incredibly nice, respectful and helpful.  We had a situation that we would have not known how to solve in Ireland and they saved the day!  They truly went well beyond normal service, and we appreciate all that was done for us during our stay.",5,2019,03,24
204,Paddy’s day delight ,"Visited here on Paddy’s days as wanted a nice cocktail . There was music in the bar which was great . 
Cocktail list was impressive and they had specials on . We got Bathtub Gin” Lewis explained what was in it, wow it was delicious. Lewis was so knowledgable about al the cocktails also we ended up staying all night , great time ! 
Well recommend and if Lewis is on ask for his recommendation! ",5,2019,03,22
204,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Excellent hotel centrally located on St. Stephen’s Green.   Very comfortable room and friendly, helpful staff.  Breakfast was amazing.   The staff went out of their way to accommodate our early arrival.   Our new go to Dublin hotel.   ",5,2019,03,21
204,St Patrick's parade,"Close to all the fun things in the city...classy hotel with a staff to match. I've been to Dublin many times and this is by far the best place to stay. We walked everywhere we wanted to go. My favorite restraint, Cornicopia, is 2 blocks away.",5,2019,03,21
204,Best hotel on the Stephens green,"This Hotels location is fantastic 
The staff are amazing extremely helpful and very pleasant 
Would recommend this hotel to couples and families as we have stay in both capacities and the services have been the same no faults at all 5 Star all the way ",5,2019,03,19
204,Another pleasant stay,Just completed another pleasant stay! I had a room with a balcony overlooking St. Stephen’s Green and thoroughly enjoyed it. Always a great location within walking distance of many places. Nice sized room with friendly staff. Would recommend and will be back again during my next trip to Dublin.,5,2019,03,18
204,Beautiful 5* hotel,"Fantastic hotel, luxury in a fantastic location. Bedroom was fabulous, the bed itself was a highlight, it was so comfortable. Staff were brilliant especially Laura, who went above and beyond to make our stay even bette",5,2019,03,18
204,"Very friendly, helpful staff","Positives: i would like to emphasize that the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Good breakfast - it might sound weird, but they have some amazing bread; fresh omelet/eggs preparation of your liking.  Nice public spaces - i liked the reception area. Good bar at the ground floor. Good location. Easy walking distance to most attractions. Grafton street literally next to the hotel. Good shopping and few good restaurants around. 
Negatives: Maybe because of St Patrick’s day being two days after our stay, the prices were quite high and not reflecting the quality of the rooms - approximately 275eur/night. We had problems with the hot water, the heat - during the day the rooms were cold. The bath tub was dirty. Furniture outdated. And mattress soft and with lumps and not very comfortable",3,2019,03,17
204,Affordable Not-so-luxury Option on St Stephens Green,"A first-time stay to explore Dublin and environs led to a week at slightly scruffy Fitzwilliam Hotel, distinguished by an absolutely impeccable location on Dublin's elegant St. Stephens Green. In addition to overlooking the park, the Fitzwilliam backs up to an upmarket shopping center and the pedestrian Grafton Street, leading to Trinity College.  The tram and airport bus have nearby stops on the park. But, it is no Shelbourne, its neighboring and proper luxury hotel across the park.

One suspects the Fitzwilliam to be an Irish Tiger relic, intended as design-forward and cosmopolitan, but with time, a little shabby and dependent on hordes of conventioneers. Furniture in the lobby, pictured so invitingly in the web photos, was positively bald with use. Tea service offered on battered trays, and janitorial tools not quite hidden behind the front curtains completed a picture of seen better times.  I was decidedly NOT offered early check-in, despite a week-long booking, as the aforementioned conventioneers took precedence, and seemed to confuse the bellmen.

When I did get into the signature queen room- a long wait sending me back down to snag own bags - I found it to be comfortable enough, although in no way achieving the glamour of online pix.  Particularly disappointing, my small balcony overlooking the park was unusable...because the window access was broken, having pulled away from the wall.  Bedding is comfortable and bathroom is adequate.

View of St Stephens Green as advertised, though lacking the option of breakfast on the balcony, also advertised.  An advertised casino had been closed and replaced, perhaps, with some bizarre tableau vivant/drinking establishment, that led to rowdy choruses of passing bands of merry-makers through the night.

The all-day restaurant Inn on the Green seemed unexceptional and not worth the expense.  The morning breakfast, however, was good and offered with most obliging Irish cheer. A signature chef's effort, Glover Alley, was not tried.",3,2019,03,14
204,"Great place, bathroom plumbing needs some work","There was one MAJOR defect in our room: bathroom plumbing. 1) Sink faucets are hard to turn on and off and they're leaking, 2) rain shower head thunders down like Niagara (no levers to adjust); 3) handheld shower does NOT work at all (broken lever); 4) toilet scatters droplets of dirty content outside upon flushing. ",4,2019,03,14
204,My stay,I arrived early (4:45) and was immediately provided a room. The black out curtains and quick nap made for a great start for a short weekend trip to visit my daughter. We enjoyed breakfast and drinks within the hotel. The front desk provided nice recommendations. Highly recommended.,5,2019,03,12
204,Would absolutely recommend!! ,"From start to finish the service was simply excellent. Laura at the front desk is an absolute credit to this business. 
The hotel offered a lovely warm retreat from the rain and snow. The cocktails in the bar are great! 
The room was beautiful and oh my goodness what a comfortable bed!! 
We will certainly return and recommend this hotel to all! ",5,2019,03,09
204,Stay a Fitzwilliam hotel Dublin,"Fitzwilliam have outstanding staff but foyer and bedrooms missing the ""wow"" for a 5*. Bathroom was dated and a few issues with tiles and mirror with damaged edge which was not expected from a 5* hotel. ",4,2019,03,09
204,quick stay,"Very friendly team members at check in. Staff was there to help at every turn.  Room was very nice and clean. had all the amenities expected.  Only downside was the bar was just that a bar, not a proper Irish Pub. ",5,2019,03,06
204,Finest Dublin hotel I have stayed in,"Fantastic welcoming, friendly, helpful and relaxed staff. Each and every one of them. A five star experience that makes you feel you are completely at home and relaxed, can't compliment the staff highly enough, they were all great. Location is fantastic and the rooms are so quiet at night you could imagine you were staying out in the countryside and not right in the heart of everything in Dublin city centre. Just a great pleasure to stay there",5,2019,03,06
204,Small and perfectly formed,"Super polite and helpful staff; smart and comfortable room (and bath robes) and a warm start to the day with a good breakfast choice. Slap bang alongside some great restaurants and pubs. Eat at Ecco... 
St Stephens Green opposite good for a walk",5,2019,03,06
204,Lovely stay,Very comfortable stay. Room was clean. Staff friendly and approachable. Only criticism was variable water temperature of shower. Lovely food and atmosphere in Inn on the Green. Would definitely recommend.,5,2019,03,05
204,Great location.,"Great location and rooms overlooking Stephen's Green especially nice. I really liked the provision of tea facilities, iron and robes. Staff were very friendly if a bit over the top. Luas outside the door another benefit.",5,2019,03,05
204,Very comfortable,"The hotel lies very central in Dublin with a tramstop right in front and opposite the beautiful St Stevens Green Park. It has a very friendly staff, especially the people at breakfast are very welcoming and the breakfast is great.",5,2019,03,05
204,Perfect in every way,"Fabulous stylish spotless hotel in heart of city. Exceptional service and amazing staff. Yummy cocktails and breakfast. Much needed Mom’s night away, we felt we were treated like Princesses. Cannot wait to return. ",5,2019,03,05

204,"Outstanding Dublin hotel - great location, wonderful staff and service","We were so fortunate to stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for 4 nights.  The location on St. Stephen's Green was ideal for our needs.  The staff is superb - friendly, professional, very helpful in every way.  They made us feel at home and catered to.  The restaurant, Glovers Alley, is phenomenal! Not a place for an every day dinner, but we were so happy we got to experience it.",5,2019,03,03
204,Rooms lovely. Fabulous Location. Decent value. Reception/bar area bleak,"Lovely room with everything you require. Really nice beds and bathroom. Cheerful colour scheme. Robes, slippers, toiletries are high standard. Trouser press/iron/hairdryer/safe all top quality.

The reception is hidden in the deepest, darkest corner of the ground floor and its absence from the entrance area makes for a very unwelcoming lobby. The bar is burrowed even further back and while the staff are pleasant the service is really slow. 

Pity about downstairs as rooms are great.",3,2019,03,03
204,Amazing!!!,"Stayed here for my sisters birthday and they really pulled out all the stops! The staff, food and location are perfect! Really good value for money and the beds were sooooo comfortable! I will return!",5,2019,03,03
204,Date night,"This hotel is amazing and the staff are so so friendly. 
Anna on reception was absolutely lovely and helped me when I was lost in my car, gave directions and even came to find me! That’s customer service for you.
The rooms are beautiful and modern, spotlessly clean with shampoo etc.
The bar is cool with booths for extra privacy.
The concierge like the reception staff could not do enough for you. 
I would definitely recommend and will be coming again. 
😁",5,2019,03,03
204,Great  Experience,"Excellent location .  Walking distance to shopping and major tourists sites. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a good combination of cold and a la carte hot dishes. Despite a busy morning, the staff kept coming around topping up coffee and asking if we needed anything .  ",5,2019,03,02
204,A Lovely Hotel,The Fitzwilliam is absolutely lovely! In the heart of City Center we were steps to Grafton Street and St. Stephen’s Green. The hotel staff were very helpful and the room was beautiful! The bar tenders in the lounge were very personable and the fireplace in the front lobby was lovely to sit by. We will be back!,5,2019,03,02
204,Feb trip,"Short stay, but comfortable and clean. Staff were helpful and freindly, meals excellent. The location can’t be beat. I’d recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone traveling to Dublin, particularly for business. ",4,2019,03,02
204,Best rainshower!,"Lovely hotel in central Dublin. Stayed here for work and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice rooms. Mad rainshower which was the most powerful I have ever had in a hotel!
Breakfast was a bit disappointing though... great that you can order but the salmon I had was tasteless.",4,2019,02,27
204,A stay to remember,"Had a wonderful one night stay in the Fitzwilliam last weekend. Staff were so friendly,courteous & professional. Gorgeous bedroom overlooking Beautiful St Stephens Green . Delious breakfast with again welcoming staff . Highly recommend this special Hotel. ",5,2019,02,26
204,Great Hotel in Dublin City,"I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel and really enjoyed my stay. The rooms are nicely updated and clean, and the service was fabulous! I didn't get a chance to enjoy either of the onsite restaurants but the breakfast was good.

Great location within walking distance of so many good spots - highly recommend!",5,2019,02,25
204,great location,"The  Hotel staff is outstanding. We were greeted at the door, helped with luggage and got into our room within 10 minutes of arrival. The rooms are spacious and clean. We really loved the location , close to all the action ",5,2019,02,25
204,Great stay,"We spent 3 nights in Dublin and the location of the hotel was fantastic right off of Grafton Street and Stephens Green. The hotel was beautiful with a modern vibe. The staff could not have been more accommodating, from the concierge, to the breakfast staff and the great bartenders who were all super informative with places to see and explore in the city.  Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,02,25
204,Family weekend away,"My family & I stayed in a suite on the 6th floor for 3 nights & arrived back home today . 
We had a really mixed stay .. personally we wouldn’t rank the hotel a 5 star. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by Concierge who brought our luggage to our room after we checked in , which was appreciated as there is no lift to the 6th floor where the lifts are. 
We had our toddler with us & they kept the buggy in storage for us so we wouldn’t have to traipse it up and down the stairs and we got it back everyday we without delay. 

We could not fault the concierge or restaurant
Staff during our stay , they were always very polite  and chatty when we saw them.

The problems for us began when we entered our one bedroom suite. The cot was in the bedroom & we preferred it to be in the sitting room but couldn’t move it out the door , we asked front desk if they could do that for us while we went out to get dinner . When we got back to put our toddler to bed the cot was still in the same place - so we asked again
And we were given an apology and a gentleman came up & did as we requested. Problem now was that the cot was extremely wobbly and dangerous, so much so we had to jam chairs and a table around all sides of it so it wouldn’t topple over !! We requested a new one the following day but the lady at reception didn’t seem too bothered when we told her   .
Then During the night at 5am every morning there was loud crackling and banging sounds , maybe from the heating coming on ? But it was loud and the banging lasted about  30 mins & woke me every morning..... 
we mentioned it to reception and they kindly
Removed a room service from
Our bill. 

Other small things that we felt didn’t help the situation was ; 
- Drinking Glasses weren’t replaced during our three day stay 
- Our room has paint scuffs that needed to be touched up
_ a cheeseboard we had finished was left in our room for two days. 
- complimentary water bottles weren’t replaced

 

It is such  shame that there were
So many niggly things happen to us during our
Stay as we really wanted to love this hotel , especially for the price ! Location is second to none & As mentioned above concierge are a great team & the Head man gave my daughter bread to feed the ducks over in Stephan’s Green!
",3,2019,02,24
204,Good with one important limitation,"We stayed one weekend. The hotels tops are that it is situated just off Grafton Street just in walking distance to where you want to go, its car park with complimentary parking, a well sorted breakfast and nice, clean rooming. However our rooms air conditioning was not to be switched off. It was turning itself on and off all night, making sounds off water dripping as well as ventilation noise. The reception promised mechanics to come but there were none whilst we were waiting and no explanation why is wasn‘t repaired. Or the offer to change rooms which we would have done happily. 

To us this was a major draw back regarding the price of the hotel.",2,2019,02,24
204,Family Trip,"I traveled to Dublin from NY for a family vacation. Our rooms overlooked the courtyard with balconies. It was quiet, comfortable and very convenient to all of the shops and restaurants. The staff was so professional and helpful. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Dublin!",5,2019,02,23
204,Fantastic location,"The room and the people are fantastic. Breakfast buffet had great selection and of top quality. Service staff fantastic.

Location is just across from a park and easy commute to so many things. A short walk to shopping and dining and near Trinity College with The Book of Kells. A bit of a walk to St Patrick's Cathedral. The Tram stop is just outside the front door.

This review is a bit dated, we travel in March of 2017.

Did I mention that the staff was awesome.",5,2019,02,22
204,Modern New Feel - Energetic Forwarding Leaning Staff,"Top service.  A mid-sized modern hotel in great location. Main tourism sites all less than 1 mile distance.  Easy level ground walks or use UBER as service to call metered taxis.  Modern Dublin downtown is reminiscent of San Francisco or San Diego's Gaslamp lacking the heavy old-world charm of less developed UK cities like Edinburgh, Scotland.  
Take at least one day go get out of town an out to the wilds of heather-covered hills of Wicklow.   Winter weather was surprising mild days 50""s and nights 30's deg F.  We welcomed the light rains when they came.
Spend evenings prowling off the beaten bath for lesser known restaurants.  Try La Cave--intimate with great French wines selection and steaks as good as highly advertised tourist venues.  ",5,2019,02,20
204,Irish hospitality in action,"A beautiful hotel, in an excellent location. The staff were anazing, helpful, friendly and very efficient, nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was wonderful and really set us up for a day of shopping and sight-seeing in the city.  There was only one small drawback and not the hotel's fault but we were disturbed early in the morning by the noise from work in the building next door -just to be aware!",5,2019,02,20
204,Excellent location and phenomenal staff,"The hotel is perfectly situated for sight seeing and enjoying the city. A short walk to just about everything, the quality of the staff and the hotel cannot be understated. For an especially personalized experience, be sure to ask for Patrick, the concierge, who is a wealth of knowledge and happy to share his ideas and experiences around the city.",5,2019,02,19
204,Lovely!,Had an amazing stay! Hotel was lovely and the food and staff were exemplary. I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for business and would love to stay again in the future. Just an overall extremely memorable stay.,5,2019,02,18
204,Fantastic service and location,"I always enjoy staying at the Fitzwilliam.  It is ideally located for shopping, dining and entertainment, and the rooms are very comfortable and well-appointed.  The bar is welcoming and the friendly service is second to none.  I can't wait for my next visit.",5,2019,02,18
204,Overnight stay on the 15th of February 2019,"Beautiful Hotel, have stayed before, would recommend it highly requesting a view of St Stephen's Green (which we were lucky to have).  Very comfortable beds and had all the necessities required for a really pleasant stay.",5,2019,02,18
204,Friendliest staff in Dublin,"A truly warm and genuine welcome (with the added benefit of being allowed to check in about 5 hours before the normal time - amazing). Food was fab, bed was comfy and the location perfect. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,02,18
204,Perfect location,Perfect spot to enjoy a trip in Dublin! Right next to St. Stephens Green and easy walk to everything else. Staff was very helpful and kind (as we seem to have found everyone to be) and the room was perfect. ,5,2019,02,14
204,First class,"I would just like to thank the staff of the Fitzwilliam for the hospitality during our recent stay. The little touches were second to none and they made us feel right at home, we could not think of a better place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Thanks again. ",5,2019,02,13
204,Fun stay with friendliest staff in Dublin,"My sister and I stayed for a night recently. The most friendly staff ever. Laura from Spain on the front desk was so helpful and bubbly and kind. She lit up reception. Gosia in the bar was so much fun and so efficient also. In fact, every member of staff we met were friendy and chatty and lovely. The Hotel itself is so central and fabulous. We love the Fitzwilliam. Thanks for a fantastic stay. Will definitely be back. ",5,2019,02,13
204,Gorgeous European Stay in the heart of Dublin,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel was gorgeous! It was a perfect location between St Stephens Green, shopping, and restaurants, plus plenty of pubs and bars. I really enjoyed the night life in Dublin as well as the cobble stone streets. Even in the colder weather it was a beautiful city to explore. ",5,2019,02,11
204,great location,a 5 star hotel  but not a 5 star experience once you go through the doors its goodbye the wonderful Stephens Green.All you see is the footfall from inside.This hotel does nothing to promote its wonderful asset   its situation.,3,2019,02,10
204,Excellent,"Everything was really impressive. A true 5 star hotel from check in, rooms to food.The shower and bathroom on of the best I’ve stayed in. 4 post bed, balcony with view. Service outstanding. Would love to come back! ",5,2019,02,09
204,Great Hotel! ,"Continues to be my go-to hotel in Dublin. Service from the front door to the front desk is excellent. Great breakfast, lounge and location, with terrific pubs, restaurants, and stores a few minutes walk in all directions. Rooms are small, but clean and get the job done!  Great spot. ",5,2019,02,08
204,Quiet yet in the heart of everything!,"We stayed her 2 nights at the start of our trip and the location was perfect. We were walking distance to the park, all the great shops and the pubs. We even walked to Jameson and St. Patrick's cathedral but most people will want to take a bus or cab. 

We arrived at 9:30 AM, well before check in time and the man at the front was very good at his job. He told us our standard room was not available but if we wanted to upgrade our room, he could give us a room immediately. We opted for the upgrade and the room was spacious and clean but it didn't feel like a 5 star hotel room. 

We mentioned it was my husband's birthday and they had a plate of chocolates with a birthday message waiting in our room upon our return. The hotel provides umbrellas for guest use as well. 

Staff were pleasant but nothing that would stand out as being very friendly or really accommodating like we experienced at other hotels.

The best thing about this hotel is truly the location and price.  Breakfast was pretty good as far as the selection and variety. Being able to order off the menu in addition to the buffet was nice. 

The only real negative was that my 75 year old aunt was trying to reach me and was told that I was not listed as a guest of the hotel. She also told them to check my husband's name and they said he was not there either. She was very frustrated and ended up making a second trip back to the hotel, once I reached her by phone. When she went to ask where to park the car, she said the staff was very abrupt with her. I felt badly that she had such a negative experience but the rest of our stay was fine.",4,2019,02,06
204,Great stay,Fantastic location and hotel itself very good. Lovely room with view over st Stephens green. Staff were all lovely and very helpful. Valet parking a great plus. Will definitely stay  again and highly recommend to others. ,5,2019,02,06
204,Great hotel - fabulous location and serve!,This hotel really is wonderful - everything from the cleanliness to the service to the location to the decor and the amazing meal I had at the restaurant! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it!,5,2019,02,05
204,Fantastic Hotel/Location,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is located at the top of Grafton Street with restaurants, theatre and shopping within a few minutes walk. This was my third visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The staff are very efficient and friendly. The hotel itself is very clean. Bedrooms are a good size with comfortable beds. Plenty of food  to choose from at breakfast with some dishes cooked fresh. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2019,02,04
204,Great hotel,"I am a repeated customer. Great hotel ... highly recommended. Central location, just a block from my office. Staff is friendly and attend your needsHad a lot of in room dining food related issues. Other than that it’s a great place. ",5,2019,02,02
204,"Great hotel, location and staff!","We had a 24 hour layover in Dublin and chose this hotel based on the positive reviews and the fact that it is so convenient to major sights. It was everything we thought it would be.  The staff were very accommodating and helpful; our room was great (we chose a larger room with a balcony which was worth the extra cost); and it was really convenient for exploring the downtown area on foot. Additionally, the hotel was well maintained and clean and the room was very quiet. We would definitely recommend this place. ",5,2019,01,31
204,Exceptional Service,"The Fitzwilliam is in a great location, but more than that you will not be disappointed with your stay.  We have stayed in some of the very best hotels in the world but the service here is exceptional and the best we have received anywhere, the staff are friendly, attentive and just exceptional.  Looking forward to staying again.",5,2019,01,31
204,Wonderful property in a great location!,"I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness of the hotel and rooms, friendliness of the staff, and location of the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The price was a little high for what I normally pay though the luxury of the property overall-as well as the views from our private balcony- were just AWESOME!

I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a romantic getaway in Dublin!",5,2019,01,29
204,Customer experience,Very happy with our stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel and would certainly recommend it to family and friends. Very helpful staff. Restaurant facilities were very good including pleasant response of staff and excellent choice of food. Well done. ,5,2019,01,28
204,5 Star Excellence,"Best place in Dublin to stay, excellent rooms, service and food, close to the theatres.Great view overlooking St.Stephens Green. Close to Grafton Street, the best shopping area in Dublin.Ideal location for theatres, shopping and exploring Dublin. ",5,2019,01,27
204,Great Experience,Very good hotel. Staff is really friendly and eager to assist. Very nice rooms. Excellent location. This was for a business trip. Very clean.  Lots of closet space and drawers for clothes. Spacious modern bathroom.,4,2019,01,25
204,Nice stay,"Pros: excellent location, friendly and efficient staffs, spacious room, comfortable bed, and excellent shower.
Cons: deco and furniture feel a bit dated for a five star hotel. But this is just my taste. ",4,2019,01,24
204,Great Location / Great Staff,"I love the Fitzwilliam. It's in a great location at the top of Grafton Street. The staff is wonderful, and the breakfast is excellent w/ reasonable prices in the bar. The only ding is the gym is lacking. They will give you a day pass to a gym a few blocks away, but if you are trying to squeeze in a workout, their room is open 24 / 7. I'm not sure if the gym down the road is open.",5,2019,01,24
204,Amazing,"Stayed here for our 15th anniversary trip. Best hotel I have ever stayed in! I just loved everything about this place. The creaky floor, the plush carpeting, the lovely atrium view... it speaks to my soul! My only regret is not staying here longer as we only had 2 days/1 night in Dublin. We booked through Costco and couldn’t be happier. The concierge was top notch - best I have ever experienced. I’m slightly obsessed with the Quince body lotion they had in the bathroom and miffed I can’t find any to buy ANYWHERE! If you read this, feel free to send me some because it is DIVINE.",5,2019,01,23
204,Love this place!,"I almost hesitate to recommend the Fitzwiliam--part of me would like to keep it a secret. The location is great and the rooms are clean and well designed; the concierge is attentive; checking in and out is easy. It's so better value than the Shelbourne (over run w/ bus tours from the US) or the Merrion Hotel (precious, over priced) or The Westbury (feels too big, a little sterile). I've tried them all, but have settled my first choice as the Fitzwilliam and I'm a guy who, living in the US, is inclined to stay at The Four Seasons.",5,2019,01,22
204,Dublin Ireland trip,This hotel is in the heart of everything. It was a very pleasant stay. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They also gave great tips to where to go. I enjoyed my stay here. I only wished I had more days in Dublin,5,2019,01,21
204,Great Attention to Detail,"If your budget can stretch to paying a bit more, highly recommend this hotel. Probably one of the most ideal locations in Dublin and whilst maybe not as characterful as some hotels, the modernity at least meant rooms were spacious and clean and had all the mod cons. Great service from Spanish Laura on reception, she could not have made us more welcome. To remember our name and room number twice on different days, after having only seen us check in, was extremely unusual for a large city centre five floored hotel with hundreds of rooms and something we have enjoyed only in more boutique much smaller places.
We had a little bit of bother with a toilet being slow to flush but this was sorted out while we were out for the afternoon as requested. There was some noise from other rooms but no more than other hotels like this.
Some lovely touches made this special, like umbrellas in the room a lovely welcome email, good concierge.
Well done Fitzwilliam, and well done to Laura.",5,2019,01,21
204,Top marks,Discreet 5 star hotel in the best location. Stayed for a couple's night away and it was perfect. Staff very attentive but not over bearing. Great breakfast. Impeccably tidy rooms. Great location for all the shops and restaurants. ,5,2019,01,21
204,Excellent hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for a short city break, and we couldn’t have been happier!

Our room was a great size, with a nice clean bathroom. There was a plug on one side of the bed, but not the other which can be quite frustrating for people with a phone, kindle etc...

The breakfast was a good option. Nice continental options and made to order hot choices.

The hotel has a smallish reception, but it’s well appointed, and a nice place to sit and relax.

Location was fab. Easy walk into Grafton street, to the castle, temple bar or over the river to everything on and around O’Connell street.

Can’t recommend highly enough.",5,2019,01,19
204,Great service!,Staff was very friendly. We were checked in very efficiently. Rooms were a good size and very clean. There was a cheese and. Fruit plate waiting for us in he room which was a nice touch. The location was great for what we were doing. We were there on business and having dinner at Shanahan’s which was right down the street. ,5,2019,01,19
204,Amazing concierge,"We did not stay at the Fitzwilliam but our group of 6 went inside as we had a problem.  We booked the Hop On/Off Bus for the day of Christmas Eve and it never came.  We bought the tix for that specific day and were at a loss as to what was up.  We walked inside the Fitzwilliam to see if they had any idea and encountered the concierge named John Byrne.

He dropped everything and worked his butt off to figure out what was up.  Seems it was a screw up by the bus operator, but Mr Byrne not only helped us confirm that but gave us a way to help resolve it down the line.  He then gave us recommendations for dinner that night, which was good.  The next day we received an email from him following up and also offering suggestions to us for the rest of our trip through Ireland and Scotland.  Who does that?  What an amazing fellow and reason enough to consider this property for your stay.

We didn't stay here but is in the absolute perfect location and the public areas wee exquisite.  Can only imagine the rooms are similarly appointed.

Thank you John and to the Fitzwilliam, make sure you take care of this fellow as he is one of the true gems of Ireland.",5,2019,01,17
204,Great stay!,"Beautiful room, very courteous, helpful staff, lovely room, very convenient and close to shops and Trinity University. We had a lovely time, just wish that we could have stayed longer. Would love to go back.",5,2019,01,16

Perfect location, convenient to Grafton Street and perfect for visiting theatres, cinemas and museums.  Rooms are very comfortable and those front-facing have magnificent views.",5,2019,01,14

204,"Great place, friendly staff, highly recommend","Beautiful historic building, nicely restored, super friendly staff, great location, happy to recommend and will return here.  Came for a short visit for business but would like to return for visit/vacation. ",5,2019,01,13
204,Wow!,"Loved my stay, will be back definitely.Sept well, quiet room, amazing shower, excellent view, a bit expensive but compared to what it offers n Dublin prices, not bad at all. My only comment is, they did not have overnight laundry service ",5,2019,01,10
204,great choice,"very central, staff wonderful and friendly, breakfast was excellent.   key for us was that we have an awkward number in our family with 2 adults 3 kids so we were able to book a family suite with pullout sofa and additional cot, which is hard to get in Europe.   ",5,2019,01,08
204,Excellent service,My experience at the Fitzwilliam hotel was very lovely. The service was very good. Lunch downstairs by the bar area was incredibly delicious. The room was also very charming. What really made the experience wonderful was the service. A particular mention to a young man by the name of George who was very polite and helpful. Veronica by the check-in desk was also nice too. A truly fantastic experience!,5,2019,01,07
204,Wonderful hospitality! ,"My husband and I are just back from an eight  day stay at the Fitzwilliam. We spent both Christmas and New Year’s there and had an absolute lovely stay! I would be remiss not to leave a review. The hospitality is above and beyond. My luggage was lost for five days and I cannot thank the concierge staff enough for all the help in locating it.  I truly appreciate all their efforts. 
I have to also compliment the whole staff at breakfast every morning. From the chef, who is from Brazil, who made the most unbelievable omelette I have ever had, to the wonderful and friendly servers that greeted us every morning. What makes this hotel so wonderful is the entire  staff. Everyone makes you feel very welcome and the little touches,  such as chocolates on the bed every evening at turn down to the gifts that were left for us on Christmas Day were delightful. 
We hope to be back again soon! ",5,2019,01,06
204,Super Location,"A lovely hotel.  It is situated on St. Stephen’s Green and less than 100 metres from the top of Grafton Street - Dublin’s major shopping street.  Staff are excellent and room was good.  There is always a concierge or two on duty in foyer and we will compliment them despite the fact that it took 30 minutes to get our luggage to our room.  The whole hotel, including our room, was very clean.  We only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was very good with plenty of choice.  Hot breakfasts are made to order rather than the buffet style of most hotels.  The bar is a bit dungeon-like, down the back with no view of street, but the staff are good.  If you enjoy a pint, walk 100 metres around the corner and each pint costs a whopping €1.30 less.  
We don’t know how they got the fifth star because, in our opinion, it is top of 4 star.",4,2019,01,06
204,New Year's Eve fun!,"We had a phenomenal stay at the hotel. Every member of the staff were beyond friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us. Dane was especially helpful as the airline lost our luggage and he called for us every day, in addition to making us New Year's Eve dinner reservations and a multitude of other things. The location was super convenient for all activities and so close we walked everywhere. The lobby was welcoming, the breakfast every morning was amazing and our room was clean and super comfy. We'll definitely stay again!",5,2019,01,06
204,Outstanding Family Vacation,The location is right in the center of everything.  Our family of 5 (of all ages) was able to use this as a base to explore Dublin.   The service of the entire staff was exceptional and the went over the top to make our stay enjoyable.  We would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2019,01,06
204,Lovely hotel. Excellent location.,"It was our first time going to dublin and I chose this hotel for its location. But everything is excellent as soon as you arrive. From the doorman to the reception staff especially Lisa. Rooms are lovely, spacious and clean. Breakfast is amazing and the staff make it extra special as they are so attentive especially the Italian waiter sorry I have forgotten his name. Looking forward to visiting dublin again and I am sure we will certainly stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel again.

Thank you for making our stay extra special.",5,2019,01,05
204,Sensational Start to Ireland,"The FitzWilliam was a great hotel for the first leg of our Ireland trip. The staff was nice and helpful. John Doyle went over the top to make sure we had a great first day in Dublin. He had fabulous restaurant recommendations and went out of his way to make sure we had resources at our next stop. He is a great asset and great fun to chat with. The room was cozy, nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was great, with a large soaking tub.Breakfast was amazing. I strongly recommend the Eggs Royale, a seafood take on Eggs Benedict. Truly fantastic. The FitzWilliam will get your Irish holiday off to a sensational start!",4,2019,01,05
204,Nice hotel - very bad sleep!,This is a nice hotel in a great location with very good staff. However we were woken at 3.45am by guys shouting coming down the corridor - not unusual or the hotels fault - but still a broken night and we were looking forward to a nice lie-in. What compunded this was the hotel thought it best to carry out intensive carpet cleaning from 9am outside our room. There was a constant droning noise until we left the room at 12.Shocking that they would not do that in the afternoon or even later in the morning. ,3,2019,01,05

DREAM HOTEL IN DUBLIN IRELAND. FITZWILLIAM HOTEL IN THE HEART OF THE CITY!

FITZWILLIAM HOTEL, DUBLIN
The heart of the City!
By Glenn Arnette
Stephen A. Gonya 

On arrival at the Dublin, Ireland airport, we were greeted and taken immediately to the most unbelievable five-star hotel, the Fitzwilliam Hotel on St. Stephen’s Green. 
Located right in the heart of the City, the hotel not only offers pristine accommodations, it places you right in the center of the best shops, restaurants, theatres, bars, museums and galleries. It is an easy walk or quick cycle, taxi, tram or bus ride! There is also secure underground parking if you happen to rent a car at the airport!
When we entered the hotel we found the staff most attentive and immediately offered quick service from the front desk to our room. 
After travels from Charlotte, NC to Boston and the 6 hour flight over to Dublin, you will appreciate all that they do for you at the Fitzwilliam. Their attention and hospitality is immediately noticeable from the opening of the front entrance to having your luggage placed in the room. You will know you have arrive at your home in Europe! 
From finger sandwiches to formal afternoon teas and classic dining you will never be unhappy with the food or drink! The downstairs bar, “The Inn on the Green,” is the gathering spot and the perfect place for a nightcap before heading off to bed! 
Not only is this five star hotel the place one should be while in Dublin, it is a boutique and city-center luxury escape. As they say, “A contemporary twist on that ancient Irish hospitality that is far from intrusive but close to perfect!” Absolutely the truth! It is top of the line, extremely reasonable, classy, spotless, well-appointed with spectacular rooms and so much more! You should take our word for it!
Thank you, Fitzwilliam, for my exceptional visit to your property!",5,2018,12,30
204,Great location. Great hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is a wonderful hotel to stay at in Dublin.  Great location and very helpful, friendly and attentive staff. Nothing was an effort for them. We have stayed many times at the hotel and will continue to do so.",5,2018,12,30
204,Our Recent Stay - 27th December Pat and Cariline,Loved our stay. Bar staff BrillAnt. Very entertaining evening. Concierge top class. Check in was just ok. Young guy came into our room at 11.20am while we were in bed and wanted to fill the mini bar - was not impressed but this was isolated. Overall very happy. Yes would return again. ,5,2018,12,29
204,Good,"Good hotel. Staff excellent and very friendly. Slow breakfast service for just tea/coffee and toast.Two beds pushed together where the seperation was felt through the sheets, would expect something over the matress like most hotels do. Just a few little things that separate a good 5 star from a great 5 star",4,2018,12,25
204,Relaxing break,Christmas shopping and relaxingGreat to be able to park so close to st Stephan green and could walk everywhereAs already mentioned lobby needs upgrading for the 5star lookHowever breakfast was one of the best we have experienced Great to have it cooked to orderThought your offering of sea bass for breakfast was worth a mention ,4,2018,12,21
204,Perfect location and top notch service!,"We loved our stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The staff are the stars of this hotel, but the location also makes it special.  We loved our rooms overlooking St. Stephens Green, and the breakfast was lovely.  Lively bar scene with locals and visitors. The Concierge team was amazing and helped us with last minute plans.  Much appreciated!!  We will definitely return.  Thanks for making first stop on our Irish jaunt memorable!!",5,2018,12,20
204,Christmas decorations,"I was slightly disappointed with breakfast this visit, I know it was very busy but it really wasn’t up to its usual high standard, but apart from that everything else was super especially lunch the previous day. And the Christmas decorations very fabulous!!",4,2018,12,20
204,Excellent location and service,We had a really good experience here. Will choose it for future visits to Dublin. The restaurant breakfast was excellent with a wide enough menu range to avoid repeating breakfast dishes over the several days. Room was very well kept and very quiet and restful. The gym was tiny but functional. The spa was not. ,5,2018,12,19
204,Birthday stop over,A really lovely hotel stayed over for daughters birthday room was ready at 10.30 which was great a nice bunch of Rose's card and fruit in room a nice surprise .Breakfast was so good .Lovely view Stephen's green staff so nice close to shops and restaurants will be returning in new year .,5,2018,12,18
204,Loved it here ,"My husband and I went to Dublin for our honeymoon and stayed at The Fitzwilliam. Our room was perfect, cozy and clean. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating to anything that we needed. 

The restaurant was delicious we had breakfast there every morning. The food was extremely fresh with a large variety to accommodate all types. 

Great location as it’s right near shops and restaurants and right across the street of Stephens green park which was a beautiful walk. ",5,2018,12,17
204,Excellent stay and perfect location!,"We had a lovely room overlooking Stephens Green. The staff from the second we arrived to checking out were very courteous and nothing was too much trouble. Loved the intimate atmosphere in the bar and lobby areas. Breakfast was busy but managed very well and I love having a menu breakfast as it arrives fresh and exactly what you want!
Looking forward to our return!",5,2018,12,17
204,"Fantastic, memorable!!","Staff were so helpful from check in to check out!! Nothing was too much. Location is fantastic, so comfortable and luxurious. Cannot wait to return. Food was excellent, rooms were clean and spacious. Breakfast in bed was amazing. Concierge was so helpful actually nearly forgot,local eateries, bars, banks nothing was too much. We both loved the experience and cannot wait to return!! Merry Christmas to all!! Kind Regards Richard Hamson And Kirsty Millward. December 2018",5,2018,12,16
204,Good hotel spoilt by poor maintenance ,"Checked in and later found there was no hot water , changed to another room which had noise coming from the air conditioning vent even though it was off . Upon check out mentioned this and the lady removed our breakfast fee because of the issues 
Shame as it’s not a cheap hotel , also breakfast is really slow as it’s brought to your table for hot food ",3,2018,12,16
204,FitzWilliam is Awesome,This was my first visit at the FitzWilliam and it was outstanding in every way.   The staff throughout the hotel could not have delivered a higher level of service to me.   The room was comfortable and extremely clean.  I will definitely return.,5,2018,12,16
204,Desparatsly needs a capital injection.,"Rooms and common areas very tired, need upgrade. Breakfast was horrible. Good location, but not close to value for the money you pay. Staff were fine, but they are selling a dated product. Needs a capital injection, and a better breakfast to be competitive.",2,2018,12,15
204,Best hotel in Dublin,This was my best hotel experience in Dublin ever. Early checkin was no problem and to receive an upgrade to a room over looking St Stephens Green was fantastic. A warm and beautiful welcome. I highly recommend a stay here. ,5,2018,12,15
204,Xmas night away ,"We arrived at the hotel and were greeted by a lovely man at the door he was very pleasant and friendly and he took our bags and We then went to check in and the girl couldn’t find our booking then found it and said we hadn’t booked breakfast which we had, we showed her the email with all the information on it, she said she would have to have a look through and see if she could find it even though we had the confirmation. Our rooms weren’t ready so we went into the bar for a drink which was lovely the barman was very friendly and helped us choose a drink. We didn’t get our rooms until after 3 and the girl who checked us in walked us to the room to find our bags weren’t there! She explained  the outlay of the room and said there is water in the minibar which is complimentary and then she went in search of our bags which arrived 20 minutes later. We had a dinner reservation so had to rush to get ready due to delay from getting our room & the wait for the bags. We arrived back at the hotel about 1am and noticed straight away how noisy it seemed in the bar area, not just the usual noise of a bar it’s seemed very enclosed. We went in for a drink and left as it was deafening. I was woken the next morning about 6am to a stifling hot room and lots of noise which sounded like showers being turned on. I got up to get the complimentary water out of the mini bar to find there was none! We got up and showered which was amazing the shower head was just fabulous! But when I went to brush my teeth we had no cold water in the sink. We then went for breakfast at 9.45 to be met with a huge queue all waiting to be seated. We didn’t get seated until 10.05 the selection was lovely and the food was nice. Ice Cold water would of been nice instead of the luke warm one that was out. The breakfast area itself felt manic, very busy and so noisy. I’m usually not sensitive to noise (I have young children) but I found it very uncomfortable I’m guessing it has something to do with the low ceilings that holds the noise in. There was a lot going on in the room that you couldn’t really relax. We spoke to girl at check out about the cold water and she was very apologetic. All staff that we came into contact with were very pleasant, friendly and attentive and really were your saving grace. As a 5 star hotel I would of expected to feel more relaxed but between the heat of the room & the noise it really wasn’t a relaxing stay. The location of the hotel is fabulous for the city centre and the later breakfast on the weekend is a great idea (maybe needs placed in a bigger room). I would recommend the hotel on location only unfortunately. I’ve have give a score of very good based on this and your staff otherwise it would of been average. ",4,2018,12,11
204,Excellent location,"We stayed in a lovely twin room overlooking a roof terrace. The beds were warm and comfy.   The staff were excellent especially John the concierge who was extremely knowledgeable. Only disappointing thing was the Irish breakfast - overcooked bacon - No potato bread, soda bread or pancakes - but hash brown - why???Smoothies were not refrigerated either. Disappoing-We could’ve got a better breakfast in one of the many cafes close by. ",4,2018,12,08
204,"Great location, lovely rooms and friendly staff","We stayed shortly before Christmas and the hotel was beautifully decorated.  The staff are all friendly.  For such a central location, the hotel rooms were quiet and peaceful.  We will definitely be staying again.",5,2018,12,07
204,"Great hotel, superb location and staff","Just recently stayed in this hotel for the weekend with my wife. From check in to check out and all in between the staff were fantastic, really friendly and helpful. I've stayed in many other too end hotels and this was by far the best service I've experienced. 

The location is fantastic, parallel to st Stephens green and 30ft from the top of Grafton st. You couldn't get better for exploring Dublin.

We didn't eat there but we did have a drink at the bar and for a hotel bar it had a nice atmosphere. Lovely to relax with a cold drink after a day around the city!

We booked a premium room and it was worth the extra money. It had great space with two 3 seater couches and a lovely view of their internal garden. My wife is 6 months pregnant and we requested an extra duvet and pillows which were waiting for us on arrival. 

Hotel has a valet service which is handy too. €20 for two nights which I thought was great value for parking in the centre of Dublin.

All in all a very enjoyable stay and I'm looking forward to our return already.",5,2018,12,06
204,Fantastic Hotel and Staff in the Absolute Best Location!!!,"My wife and I were fortunate to be able to stay in this lovely hotel for 2 weeks.  Because we were staying so long, they upgraded us to an amazing room overlooking St. Stephen’s Green.  Thanks Cormack!   The room was nicely appointed with a 4 poster bed and a small sofa by the window to enjoy that view.  The bathroom was also nice with a separate large soaking tub and shower.

The staff was great and treated us like royalty the entire time.  Seriously, all the staff in all areas were amazingly professional and courteous...and I’ve stayed in many hotels over the years.  There is a nice bar on the ground floor with an excellent whiskey selection and cocktails...pretty good menu as well.

The location is simply the absolute best in Dublin.  It’s at the beginning of Grafton St and across from St Stephen’s Green, which puts you walking distance to hundreds of great restaurants, pubs, bars and shops.  We were there before Christmas, so everything was decorated and had a great atmosphere (actually that’s true year round in this area in Dublin).  

I love Dublin and this hotel.  I highly recommend it, if you are in Dublin for any amount of days.  You’ll love it all too.  Enjoy!

",5,2018,12,06
204,Superb hotel with Excellent Service,"Even before we arrived, the hotel were in touch to see if we had any requirements.  During our stay we were treated like VIP's!  The service in this hotel is astoundingly excellent in every area and at every level.  ",5,2018,12,04
204,Ideal location!,"Fab location. Beautiful hotel next to St Stephens green shopping centre. Street entertainment outside. Underground carparking (limited places) + €20 overnight fee, as with most city centre hotels.  Pleasant staff. A little expensive but you pay for location.  ",5,2018,12,03
204,Great,"Lovely hotel, great staff, service amazing. The rooms are really quiet so no disturbed sleep. Due to the old building there’s a lack of plug sockets to plug in all your devices, I had 2 by the bed with one not working. But other than that a great hotel. ",5,2018,11,30
204,Classy and comfortable Dublin hotel in excellent location,"A very nice upmarket hotel with comfortable rooms just on St Stephen's Green, a very short walk to the many shops and restaurants nearby. The staff were friendly, the bed was comfortable and the lobby was cosy. I would happily return.",4,2018,11,29
204,Great Hotel,"This is my favourite hotel in Dublin. The Fitzwilliam has great service, nice rooms, a very central location and good breakfast. There is also free WiFi throughout the hotel and it works well. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend. ",5,2018,11,29
204,Our stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin was a great first time experience in Ireland for my husband and I.,The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin truly enhanced the experience of visiting Ireland for the first time. The hotel staff are amoungst some of the friendliest people I've ever met. I can honestly say that I have never before felt more welcome at a hotel. ,4,2018,11,28
204,fabulous location on St stephens Green,"Excellent stay in this beautiful hotel. Location couldn't be better. Staff go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. The rooms were lovely, very quiet and clean. The extra touches and friendly service were noteworthy.i will be back...",5,2018,11,26
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel,"Was an incredible stay, you absolutely can’t beat the location. My only issue was that guests let their doors slam shut during the night, which led to interrupted sleep. Nothing the hotel can help there. It’s a fantastic hotel!",5,2018,11,24
204,Fabulous Fitzwilliam Dublin,"Great service, friendly and helpful staff and perfect location. Wonderful stay as always but appreciated the care taken to meet my limitations in walking. Convenient room and upgrade to shower facility as well as bath. Always a pleasure to visit the Fitz.",5,2018,11,24
204,Loved the FitzWilliam,"The Helle family stayed there this summer for two days and enjoyed Dublin very much.  We came back for five more days ending with the U2 concert on November 6th.   The doorman, the reception desk, the bar tenders ---- all superb.   The room was wonderful and the location --------- WOW.   You can walk to anything in Dublin.   Its a wonderful hotel with wonderful people",5,2018,11,20
204,Fantastic!,"Overall a very pleasant stay at the Fitzwilliam, Dublin. Hotel was clean, very friendly and helpful staff, lovely rooms and in an excellent location. Would definitely recommend and be back again for an other stay soon. ",5,2018,11,20
204,Breakfast Issues,"I think some sort of verification process should be considered relating to whether their new ordering system has actually passed on a food order to the kitchen or not, we never got our food, because of a malfunction of sorts within the system, it took 30 minutes to discover that no order was recieved. Maybe they should look at a buffet style set up.",1,2018,11,19
204,"Fantastic location, lovely staff","The location is hard to beat and we had a view of St Stephen’s Green, the trade off to this though is that we had a lot of street noise on a busy Saturday night. Loved the view but if I stayed again I would probably request a quieter location. Fab selection at breakfast with very attentive service. A lovely treat left in the room for us on check in. Would love to see a coffee machine in the room but it’s a small gripe from a coffee lover. Love the Diptyque toiletries & the friendly staff. This is not quite at the level of the Westbury or the Shelbourne in terms of luxury, but I think the price reflects that to be fair. ",4,2018,11,19
204,Not 5 stars ,Stayed with my husband and although 1st impressions were good we didn’t actually get to see our room until late at night as it wasn’t ready before we went to the rugby. No issue with that as understand the 3pm check in rule however we only saw the issues with the room in daylight. The standard of the bathroom was not good from rust around sink area to dirty grouting and lack of even basic cleanliness around skirting. (See photos)Add broken tiles and a dirty carpet in the bedroom and the impression and reality is far from 5 star. Breakfast in the room didn’t improve anything as it was poor and wasn’t eaten. Bland and poor quality produce. Whey checking out my husband was asked how our stay was. He replied it was poor however no further comment was made or questions asked by staff. On a plus side the staff were in general very friendly and accommodating and location is good but significant improvement needed ,2,2018,11,18
204,Perfect location,This hotel is in an excellent location staff so friendly and professional nothing to much trouble.Enjoyed our stay but think the rooms are overpriced furniture would need upgraded.I would stay again due to the location as it’s within walking distance to main shopping areas.,4,2018,11,18
204,Such accommodating staff,"Lovely hotel, great location, spotless  room but the one thing which stood out was the desire of the team to accommodate us.  We were meeting family for the evening and then again over breakfast and the team sorted their overnight parking and reserved a table at breakfast and charged us very reasonable rates for the adults for breakfast and no charge for the children. Thanks to everyone who we were in contact with from hospitality to reception. Particular thanks to the young woman at reception who sorted everything for us on check in ( sorry I didn’t get her name) and to Kevin who sorted the breakfast arrangements this morning and his lovely team and Patrick the Concierge and his team for their warm welcome. ",5,2018,11,17
204,"Fizwilliam Hotel, Dublin","Excellent location.  The hotel's staff are very professional, friendly, and helpful.  The hotel and the  rooms are very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay very much.  I highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  ",5,2018,11,16
204,1 Year Anniversary Trip,"Brilliant hotel. Great location, right across from the metro/train and St Stephens Green is right in front - lovely for walking around in nature. Perfect concierge staff - they arranged everything from tours and taxis to itineraries. Room was spotless although a bit dated, all the bonus touches made up for it (CD player that piped to the bathroom, turn-down service, slippers & robes, free bottled water). We had the breakfast twice at the mezzanine level, service was so-so but the selection was wonderful & plenty. Hot food was made to order. This was our 1-year anniversary trip and we were treated wonderfully; we also received a lovely fruit & chocolate plate that said happy anniversary. Always appreciate the little touches!",5,2018,11,15
204,Another wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam many times, and it never disappoints.  My experience this most recent time was the best ever.  The front desk staff could not have been nicer when I arrived early and they went out of their way to find a room for me by noon, and even invited me to have breakfast and lunchtime drinks in the bar.  Speaking of breakfast, each morning I received fantastic service from the staff, especially Zuleima, Carlo and Kevin.  My room was great too.  Thank you to the entire Fitzwilliam team for a delightful three-night experience!",5,2018,11,14
204,Great Service!,"The service at this hotel is wonderful, such friendly and welcoming staff.
Location is brilliant. Right across the road from St Stephens Green and a 5min walk to all the shops. You can walk to Temple Bar and so many other locations.

The room was great. A good size, comfy, clean and a nice ambience. The little chocolates as a welcome treat were delicious.
I like the little touches.",4,2018,11,13
204,A great place to meet up,Have just spent a few days at the Fitzwilliam Hotel with a very long standing friend. She flew in from Boston as I arrived from Bath. The room was super and the staff excellent. Breakfast was delicious. I would thoroughly recommend this old world gem well located in the centre of the city. ,5,2018,11,13
204,One of the best hotel experiences I've had,"The staff at the Fitzwilliam was thoughtful, friendly and made us feel at home. The room was wonderful, shower was great (excellent water pressure) and they had lots of small touches to make us feel special. 100% would stay again.",5,2018,11,13
204,Amazing Hotel!,The hotel was amazing to stay in and we would recommend it to anyone. The breakfast was incredible and the rooms were very comfortable. Not a single problem from checking in to checking out. The highlight of our honeymoon!,5,2018,11,13
204,Best Staff in Dublin!,Can't say enough about the Amazing Concierge Staff who went above and beyond to help us with missing luggage.  This is an elegant and friendly Hotel to stay at. It is ideally located to shopping and sightseeing ....and the breakfast buffet is delicious.,5,2018,11,12
204,Super stay,"Warm welcome by conciërge. Lovely clean room. Chocolades at night! Great included warm breakfast. Conciërge managed a booking at a lovely restaurant, he was very helpful throughout our whole stay.  Staff is very friendly, have a drink at the bar as well!",5,2018,11,12
204,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Nice hotel in a convenient location. Close by pedestrian walking areas with plenty of pubs and shopping.  Near the Pop on/off bus. Small exercise facility, no pool. The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant.  Enjoyed the stay and the hotel.  Would stay again.",4,2018,11,10
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin,"Our room was clean and sufficient for our night in Dublin. We were within walking distance of restaurants, shopping, St Patrick's cathedral, Dublin Castle and Christ Church. Staff was friendly, courteous and helpful.",5,2018,11,09
204,Loved the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin and would return again!,We just returned from celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary at the Fitzwilliam.  The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring Dublin.  The staff went above and beyond to ensure our first visit to Dublin was a memorable experience.If you need any assistance - call the concierge and ask for Victor - he was very helpful and always willing to help answer all of our questions from dining reservations to our excursions. ,5,2018,11,07
204,Old fashioned hotel,"This hotel is a bit old fashioned and the interior as well as the carpet is old. A redecoration should be considered, but I am aware that many people likes this kind of interior. I don’t. I prefer a more modern or if not, then exclusive decoration. The fitness room is very small and old machines (only three) in a very small room. Nevertheless, it is a nice hotel without being spectacular. service at the reception is friendly and focused. You do feel welcome. ",3,2018,11,07
204,Wonderful hotel,"The location is excellent. The staff amazing.  John, the doorman was a walking history book and tour guide.  The rooms are very vice and comfortable with excellent housekeeping.  I loved the stocked water in the fridge.

204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin,"We had a wonderful time staying in Dublin at the Fitzwilliam Hotel as we celebrated our 35th Wedding Anniversary for a week! The location is perfect for exploring Dublin on foot and meeting up with our tour busses. Lots of dining, pubs and shopping right there. A very fun area and atmosphere. The train is just across the street and various bus stops are all over locally. All of the staff was very pleasant and accommodating and went out of their way to please us as their guests. The room was very nice, very clean and provided luxury toiletries, hair dryer, robes and lovely towels. The bathroom area was spacious, modern look and plenty of hot water for showering. We had a deluxe premium room with a lovely balcony overlooking St. Stephen's Green and parts of the city. They provide very nice amenities throughout your stay which are very much appreciated such as complimentary waters, holding our luggage until our room was ready as we had arrived 8am, complimentary breakfast the morning we arrived, nightly chocolates, departing gift, wake up calls, obtaining a taxi when needed, great dining suggestions, and always a smile on every staff member! The area is safe and we would definitely stay here again when visiting Dublin! Thanks Fitzwilliam Hotel for a wonderful experience!",5,2018,11,05
204,Perfect hotel choice in Dublin,This was my fist visit to Dublin. I would not even imagine a better hotel option. Great location and fantastic service. The room furnishing was above my expectation for this price level. Will definitely come back.,5,2018,11,04

 nice room friendly staff
only negative was the too was too warm  the air conditioning took forever to cool the room  down  ( it would only work while you were in the room)    good thing was you could open a window",4,2018,11,04
204,Excellent hotel,"Great choice for a stay in Dublin. We were close to shopping and everything else we were doing here. I'm a runner so I always scope out if there are places I can run before booking and definitely was as it is on Stephen's Green. The breakfast was continental. To upgrade and get an egg, it felt pricey at 22€. Very good service and comfortable rooms. Our shower was a smidge small but it could be just us being used to our house one.",5,2018,11,03
204,An excellent stay,"We had a wonderful experience at the Fitzwilliam. Friendly staff,gorgeous hotel, beautiful, comfortable room and walking distance to nearlyeverything in Dublin. Highly recommend this outstanding hotel, simply the best. ",5,2018,11,02
204,Wonderful visit to the Fitzwilliam,Excellent location in Dublin.  Everything is around you within walking distance.  Staff was warm and welcoming.  Its a boutique style hotel that has great ambiance.  Staff bends over backwards to make your stay perfect.  Breakfast is delicious - lots to chose from.  Cant wait to stay again!,5,2018,10,31
204,Fantastic staff. Great location,We drove straight to the car park of Fitzwilliam Hotel & as my daughter & I were making our way to reception a member of staff saw us & offered us help to get to reception. Staff at reception  are really friendly. The hotel is really nice & in a great location but the staff are what made our stay,5,2018,10,31
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel is wonderful!,"The Fitzwiliam Hotel is in a great location, across from St. Stephens Green (beautiful park), lots of places for shopping, restaurants, pubs, transportation.

204,Perfect location and great hotel!,"This hotel is not only centrally located for attractions and the tram in Dublin, but is a relaxing haven after a full day of sightseeing. Highly recommend this friendly, clean and well appointed hotel!",5,2018,10,30
204,Excellent hotel,"We just returned from a two night stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel and I was very sorry to have to leave!

We were allocated room 353 which is a signature queen room that faces the courtyard area. The room was very quiet and we never heard any noise from anyone else whether in the hotel or outside. The bed was very comfy and we slept really well. 

Breakfast was brilliant. The hot food was cooked to order and it was really enjoyable. 

All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. 

The hotel was really tastefully decorated for Halloween too which was a nice touch. 

As the break away was for my birthday, it was really nice to get a birthday message in our room on the first night. We also had chocolates on our bed both nights. 

We would stay here again in a flash and would recommend to everyone!",5,2018,10,30
204,Fantastic hotel in great location,"I've stayed at the Fitzwilliam a couple times for work and I've always had a great experience. Their staff is very attentive and helpful, I particularly remember Laura at the frontdesk who was lovely and really helpful during my check out. Will keep coming back every time I'm in Dublin",5,2018,10,29
204,Wish I could find any drawback,"The hotel room, the breakfast, the staff,complimentary water and apples - everything was perfect. Moreover, we arrived quite early and the room was already at our disposal. Next door there is a great restaurant, applying for a 1 star Michelline - try it. I can assure you- there will be no regrets.",5,2018,10,24
204,made our stay,This hotel was recommended to us by a cousin that lives in Dublin....she said it would be very convenient to the central Dublin area (which it was)....the plus was the people that worked there and were most gracious to help with any questions or concerns we had...,5,2018,10,24
204,"Lovely hotel, perfect location and top notch service","Just enjoyed a fabulous stay at The Fitzwilliam! The staff, from front desk to concierge to bar, are friendly, accommodating and incredibly helpful with information about Dublin. Housekeeping kept our room impeccably clean, including a nightly routine with chocolates left on the pillow. We had a lovely, well appointed room with a quaint balcony overlooking St. Stephen's Green. Nice touch with fresh flowers in our room and throughout this lovely hotel. During our visit, the hotel did a fabulous job of decorating for Halloween. The location is ideal - within walking distance of a tremendous amount of tourist places, pubs and restaurants. This hotel obviously prides itself on service and that certainly was evident during our stay. We highly recommend The Fitzwilliam and will absolutely stay here again on a future visit.   ",5,2018,10,24
204,Definitely not a 5 Star hotel,"I am a bit confused by the reviews of this hotel.  We recently stayed here and it did not live up to our expectations.  Our room was one of the smallest rooms I could imagine for the price tag (an per the descriptions on the web site)  Very cramped and smelly. There was no place to even put a suitcase! The decor was run down, the carpet dirty, the walls and door frames scratched up.  The hallways smelled very strangely.  I booked the hotel based on the raving reviews but I can honestly say I would not come back to this hotel - not even for one night.  The bar closed early, there was place to have a late meal.  The breakfast looked good (although we did not eat it).  Good location - central to town.  The gym was a joke - can't even call it a gym.  All in all a very big dissapointment.",2,2018,10,24
204,50th Birthday in Ireland,The Fitzwilliam was just fantastic. They upgraded our room without us asking and it was just wonderful. It was my wife's 50th birthday and the reason we were in Ireland. This was our final hotel and it left us just feeling great about the whole trip. Great way to end it.,5,2018,10,24
204,Perfect stay In every way!,"We couldn't fault this hotel for anything. The location near Grafton Street is excellent and its only a short walk from the air coach stops. The staff are full of smiles and so friendly and helpful. The rooms are beautiful, spotless and beds so comfortable. The breakfast is amazing! It was my first trip to Dublin and will be back! Thank you The Fitzwilliam for making my stay extra special. ",5,2018,10,23
204,A lovely stay in the heart of Dublin!,There is simply nothing about this hotel that is negative. The service is outstanding and the staff treats you like royalties.

204,Perfect Location,"Room was a little small but everything else was excellent and fit my needs for the week perfectly. Great location to attractions, shopping, restaurants, pubs, and transportation.  Staff was very friendly and especially the concierge who helped me with my requests for transportation and information. A special thank you also to room service who delivered me coffee every day very early in the morning exactly on time. This was my first trip to Ireland and everyone was so friendly and I even got lucky with the weather.  So I hope to return one day and would definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel again. ",5,2018,10,20
204,Great stay,"The room was a little noisy and the restaurant menu options were somewhat limited, but otherwise it was very good. The members of staff were very friendly, the room was spotless and the decor was awesome.",4,2018,10,20
204,Super stay,This place was really warm and comforting. Service was extremely personable and the location is perfectly central. The gym is a lacking but the agreed is across the street so you should get outside anyway! It didn’t detract at all. Loved it; thanks team. ,5,2018,10,19
204,A perfect 10.,I have stayed at this hotel a number of times over the years and every stay has been outstanding.  Every part of the guest experience is first class.

204,Amazing room with fabulous service!,"I had the best stay at this hotel. The room was amazing, very comfortable, with many seats. I find that great specifically if you want to get work done.
The highlight of my trip was Laura at the front desk. She went beyond out of her way to ensure I had a great stay. It was ensuring to have such a great service, particularly when this was my first trip to Ireland. She connected me to a massage at the hotel with Ursula, which was very relaxing after a long flight. Thanks for hiring such a great staff member!",5,2018,10,18
204,Friendly and convenient,"Stayed here a lot. Good people, comfortable rooms. Very convenient. Nice decor. Guinness always goes down well. Responsive at front desk - happy crew. Room service not great and no swimming pool which I miss",4,2018,10,17
204,A lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam Dublin!,"We stayed five nights at the Fitzwilliam Dublin. It is a lovely hotel situated ideally in the center of town, steps from Grafton Street and Temple Bar and directly across the street from St. Stevens Green. Particular highlights of the hotel are standout employees, Lewis (bartender extraordinaire), and “Magic” the delightful host at breakfast. Every member of the staff was delightful and very helpful. The Fitzwilliam is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Dublin!",4,2018,10,17
204,Great!,Lovely boutique hotel in a fantastic location within short walking distance  to many shops and restaurants. Excellent service. Personal touch... Staff remembered our name. Would absolutely stay again!!,5,2018,10,16

204,A pretentious hotel that is not as good as its rating,I stayed at the Fitzwilliam last week on the occasion of a conference in Dublin. The hotel is on the expensive side. The room I had was well appointed bur rather small. The air conditioning was cold no matter what temperature it was set at. And when the air conditioning was off there was a continuous hiss of air circulation which I found annoying. The breakfast choices were good but not up to a 5 star rating. the staff was competent and helpful.,4,2018,10,15
204,Beware if booking through discount sites. ,"Not a great stay I’m afraid.. Our room 314 was extremely small compared to others which we saw from the floor map in our room.  When I enquired about the size of room and the fact that we had a double bed and just a very small ‘over bath’ shower that it was difficult to get into and out of.  Slippy! Older guests could not manage! I was told that it was because it was an ‘Expedia’ room.  In order to have larger room with walk in shower we would have to book higher cat room.   We  paid almost full price >300€ and  will certainly consider this policy when we  book a 5* in Dublin City Centre again.  It is our experience that in booking other 5* in area such small undesirable rooms are not given . Felt like we were 2nd class guests by booking Expedia. We were members of the hotels rewards scheme which made no difference and never acknowledged.  We were given a pack of biscuits and a note offering late checkout- if available -this letter stated we were ‘vip Expedia guests’ but the pokey room did not reflect this! Late checkout was not needed by us. Bed so small. We have super king bed at home so not conducive to a good nights sleep. Size of bed not clearly stated when booking - not hotels fault here, I imagine but leads to disappointment on arrival. Air con default was ‘off’ which we did not realize until we woke during the night with the heat. Breakfast was good enough. Staff lovely but too busy. Waited 10 min for orange juice to be replaced and then gave up! Felt like a 4* chain experience I’m afraid.  Location ++, but other better choices in the area in my opinion. ",3,2018,10,15
204,Wonderful experience,"I could not be happier with the Fitzwilliam for our first visit to Dublin. The staff of the hotel in particular are far beyond their peers in competence, friendliness and professionalism.   I would not hesitate to stay here again or to highly recommend it to others. ",5,2018,10,13
204,Friendly staff and great breakfast ,"We have stayed there 15 years ago and sadly not much has changed in the hotel, the rooms are small, no USB plugs or any other modern amenities in the room, the bathroom are not designed for two people, no extra shower and hot water is tricky to control.
The location of the hotel is perfect if you want to explore Dublin walking or with the public transportation, t
Staff is very friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is outstanding, there are not many hotels out there with this great selection of breakfast, freshly made juices and service with a smile, I would come back here, but would like to see some upgrades in the rooms.",4,2018,10,12
204,Hotel stay,We had an awesome time staying at your hotel. Patrick was extremely helpful when my husband hurt his hip bringing us ice and helping us find a shop that sold canes.  John was a wealth of knowledge and took the time to write things out that we may have never have seen without his imput.,5,2018,10,12
204,Awesome,Wonderful well located hotel.  Service outstanding . The room was lovely well appointed and bright . We would stay again in a heartbeat . Concierges were particularly helpful. Has a lovely massage also,5,2018,10,11
204,Great Place to stay,We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights and it was great.  The hotel is in a perfect location at the top of Grafton Street.  We were able to walk to almost every attraction that we wanted to go to and there is a tram stop directly across the street. There were shops and restaurants in every direction.  It is also across the street from a lovely park. The hotel staff (concierge and front desk) were always pleasant and very helpful.,5,2018,10,11
204,Was expecting better,"I travel to Dublin regularly on business and pass this hotel always thinking it looks really nice and speaking to others they say it is one of the best in Dublin.
I did enjoy my stay here recently with my wife but I was expecting a bit more for the cost and service received. We arrived earlier than check in time and I totally understand that rooms are not ready at that time but the staff just seemed rushed off their feet and they did mention on numerous occasions that it is really busy on a Saturday. Even when we went to leave our luggage with concierge he was too busy trying to deal with other customers and just took our bags without giving us a ticket. This resulted on confusion once we were allowed to check in because they couldn’t find our bags. Turns out the bags were taken to our room but we sat for 20 minutes before this was confirmed. Rooms are pretty basic for a 5 star hotel and I must say I feel other 4 star hotels I’ve stayed in Dublin, rooms are a better standard. The beds are comfortable and the hotel is in an excellent location but sadly it did not meet my expectations. ",3,2018,10,10
204,Great Hotel in a prime location!,"This hotel is in an excellent location. It's a very nice hotel, very clean and the room/bathroom were great. There were plenty of outlets and a nicely sized nightstand on both sides of our bed, which isn't always the case .This made our stay more comfortable.

The bathtub was very high, making it a bit difficult for short people like ourselves to get in and out.",5,2018,10,09
204,Amazing service,Stayed here with a group which had stayed at some elegant hotels in Ireland including a castle.  Service here was unbelievable.  Clean towels and empty wastebaskets numerous times during the day.  Had meals here which were also excellent.  ,5,2018,10,09
204,Great location in the midst of it all,"After a few days in a different 5star Dublin Hotel we wanted to change to another location: The Fitzwilliam Hotel! Although our room was smaller than the Junior Suite in the previous hotel, this one had far more style! The room didn‘t have a view but looked onto the inner court which is quiet and really nice! Above all it is the little extras that make the stay at Fitzwilliams really special: Beautiful flowers in the room, excellent bathroom products, outstanding cleanliness. 
The only bad experience was one employee of the concierge team. He was not helpful at all, nervous and short in his answers, the way to make you feel as a dumb tourist! But this can happen everywhere and did not change our excellent experience.
Nevertheless, the concierge team should be able to give correct information about public transport. We got wrong information twice. You cannot buy a daycard for both LUAS AND DART at the newsstand. 

When in Dublin again, we will stay in the Fitzwilliams!",5,2018,10,08
204,Catch up with friends,"Great stay again , cannot fault this hotel, Location is superb,the food and service are top notch , service is so friendly, always stay here when home from Australia, great Irish hotel and also stayed at Fitz in Belfast and it is the same, like twins , loved it",5,2018,10,08
204,UK Tripn 2018,Everyone we met was gracious and helpful.  Customer service will make or break and experience for me.  Your staff was wonderful.

204,Dublin HQ - The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"Comfortable rooms, wonderful staff, clean like American hotels used to be - and central to some of the best things in Dublin.  Breakfasts were amazing.  When we return to Dublin we will come back to the Fitzwilliam.",5,2018,10,06
204,Great Location / Great Staff,"I travel to Dublin a lot and generally stay at the Fitzwilliam.  It's a great location.  The concierges are wonderful.  The food is also very good.  The only negative is the gym is lacking, but I notice many Europeans don't use gyms.  I guess having a great gym is an American thing.  But the rest of the hotel is pretty awesome",5,2018,10,05
204,Luxury hotel,"One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in.  I would consider this a 5 star hotel.  The staff, food, beverages, rooms and decor was amazing.  I loved that the location was close to everything pubs, shopping, buses and trains",5,2018,10,03
204,Wonderful Staff,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam as part of a vacation package and were extremely pleased with the facilities and the staff.

The front desk was extremely pleasant and welcoming as well as helpful.  The concierge service went above and beyond.  They made sure to go out of their way to offer assistance. The host in the breakfast dining room was very polite, helpful and welcoming. The rooms were clean and beds comfortable.

I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,10,03

204,Incredible value and service,"We stayed at this hotel in August.  The location is perfect for exploring the center of Dublin, with the hotel being very quiet and peaceful. The room was beautiful as well, but the most impressive aspect was the superlative service. Everyone we encountered was gracious.
When our flight was delayed, the Fitzwilliam gave us brunch let us store our luggage and spend a few more hours touring Dublin. 
My husband and I consider this one of the best hotels we have stayed in -- it's the total package! You get a lot for your money.",5,2018,10,01

204,Good stay,"Check in was quick, room was clean and what was needed and overall stay was good.  Check out was slow which was more down to slow guests ahead of us but could have done with a few more staff.  Breakfast was of good quality.",4,2018,10,01
204,Had a great stay!,"My husband and I spent three nights at The Fitzwilliam and it was terrific!
We arrived very early on the morning if September 10th (our plane was one hour early 🤗) so we were very happy to have booked our room for arrival the previous night.
The young man at the desk could not have been nicer and that quality was evident in the staff for the rest of our stay. Everyone,Concierges,housekeepers,and especially the morning waitstaff was just so nice.
They have a fabulous breakfast that includes a wonderful selection of foods from their buffet as well as cooked to order entree’s. Delicious!
Our room was very nicely appointed,VERY clean,and the shower and bed ....so very nice.
We very much enjoyed our stay at The Fitzwilliam and hope to return one day.",5,2018,09,30
204,What a difference a hotel can make,"My first visit to Ireland was 2016 and I was so turned off by Dublin, it was like being back in New York City. This time we stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel and the people could not have been nicer. We were able to get early check in - thank God, cause we were exhausted after flying through the night. The shower felt like Heaven and the beds and pillows are THE BEST. The concierge, Patrick, gave us the warmest welcome when we arrived. You can’t beat the location either, with St Stephens Green right across the street.
I will be back, I will stay at the Fitzwilliam and I will recommend it to all my friends headed to the Emerald Isle.",5,2018,09,30
204,Great location,"I stayed for a couple of nights on the way to the UK. The service was attentive and reflective of a 5-star hotel. The location is excellent. Breakfast menu has lots of choice and service was prompt. I ate in the bar a couple of times and the drinks and food menus were interesting and offered lots of choice, with excellent service. Great concierge services. Big thanks to Dane for assistance prior to my stay. If booking a garden view room, suggest confirming the view. My garden view room faced an internal lawn (with some patchy grass) and a wall of windows from another part of the hotel, precluding having the drapes open.",4,2018,09,28
204,trip to dublin,Very good breakfast (much needed when walking a lot) and lunch (fish and chips / chowder are very good). The location is centric and one step away from all the places we wanted to visit. Very friendly staff. ,5,2018,09,28
204,Dublin Visit,"We stayed in Dublin for three days and it was an amazing experience!  And our hotel stay has had a lot to do with it. The location, comfort of our accommodations, friendliness and hospitality of staff, complimentary breakfast and cocktails,  all deserve high regards. We ill definitely be back!",5,2018,09,27
204,Good location ,"The hotel is situated on St Stephens Green right next to a hue shopping arcade, walking distance from major shopping and entertainment street with a tram stop right outside.

Parking is available behind the hotel in an underground car park.

The room was quite comfortable and tastefully furnished. It could have been a bit bigger.

Bathroom was good but the shower was crazy. Very high speed and would fill up the tub faster than it could drain out. The shower curtains were inadequate to hold the force of the water in and invariably after every shower there would be a puddle of water on the floor.

Downstairs bar was excellent and the little library nook next to the lifts was great for a sit down with drinks.",4,2018,09,27
204,Request a high level room,"Our room was directly on the court yard, early morning birds will hide from the rain in the window frame and keep making loud noise. We stayed here for couple of nights and the birds were there both days. The room was tiny, for the price, we expected a bigger room or upgrade of some sort especially that were VIP members of Expedia.",4,2018,09,27
204,Disappointed in Dublin,Front Desk needs to co-ordinate reservation with Door Staff. I didn't need to be shipped off to another hotel when I DID HAVE A RESERVATION AT YOUR HOTEL.   Not a very nice way to treat hotel guests.  Unnecessary stress!,3,2018,09,27
204,Hotel Experience,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam 9-7 to 9-10.  For the price, I was a little surprised at the size of the room with requested twin beds. Our hot water spigot did not work at the sink and the bathtub was a tall step up. The rain head shower was powerful but the hand held apparatus did not work.  The staff was awesome and accommodating and the concierge was very helpful.  We enjoyed our stay and never mentioned the hot water spigot problem.  Expensive hotel in best part of Dublin and close to everything.  The staff made our stay enjoyable, adventureous and fun.  Our flight had us arrive about Noon and the hotel stored our bags and got our room ready for early check in by 2 p.m.",5,2018,09,26
204,Dublin Visit,"Mother daughter Ireland trip. We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel upon our arrival from New York for one night, leaving for Killarney the next day. The staff was attentive, professional, helpful, knowledgeable and most welcoming. The hotel modern, well appointed and clean. Rooms were spacious and most comfortable. We returned to the Fitzwilliam on the last leg of our Ireland trip and were welcomed by the staff as if they knew us well, they remembered us from the week before.... The attention by the door staff was amazing, I thank them for making it so easy. The bar and restaurant staff were friendly, helpful and made us feel comfortable after our red eye flight from NY! I recommended the Fitzwilliam to friends who will be traveling to Dublin in 2019. I recommend this hotel to all considering a trip to Dublin. ",5,2018,09,25

204,Fantastic Start!,"Our first awesome experience on our trip to Ireland was a two day stay at this exceptional hotel. We were immediately greeted by Patrick Fitzgibbon, Head Concierge. We were amazed at the outstanding level of service, knowledge of Dublin, and friendly demeanor that Mr. Fitzgibbon provided. The hotel was very modern and had every possible high quality amenity we could have wished for!  The location was perfect. It was right around the corner from the hop on/hop off bus, and across the street from beautiful St. Stephen’s Green. Shopping and dining were only steps away from the hotel.  We highly recommend that you stay here as soon as you arrive in Dublin! It is definitely 5 star! ",5,2018,09,23
204,Inconsistent Experience,"First the positives.  Excellent location.  Friendly staff. Nice sized rooms.  Excellent breakfast.  Unfortunately, there were a few ""misses"" that you wouldn't expect in this class of a hotel.  The hot water was out for almost an entire day.  The next day we asked that our toilet be repaired while we were out during the day, and four hours later nothing had been done.  Only when we complained did they respond.  The staff was very apologetic, and it didn't really impact the great time we had in Dublin, but it wasn't an experience consistent with the hotel's price or rating.",3,2018,09,23
204,Tired and noisy,"First time I stayed at the Fitzwilliam - I normally use the Merrion but it was full.  
The hotel is well located on St Stephens Green, but it is tired, it really needs a refurb to justify the 5* rating.  Given the purple colour scheme in the hallways and wavy carpets in the rooms, it has been quite a while since the interior was redecorated, and I am afraid it shows.  
Pros: The hotel was clean, the bathroom was clean if on the small side, the trouser press worked and the iron didn't dribble. Front desk staff were helpful.
Cons: The noise.  I think most hotels have solid block walls between rooms, the Fitzwilliam seemed to have plasterboard. Whatever the cause, slamming doors down the hall, your neighbour trying to plug his laptop in, all carried clearly into the room. I notice other reviews have picked up on this. It really wasn't acceptable.",3,2018,09,23
204,(Almost) Perfect start to my Ireland holiday,"The Fitzwilliam was everything I was looking for.  Overlooking St. Stephen's Green, the hotel offered nice views, relative tranquility for a city hotel, and was very well located.  Many of of the city's fine dining restaurants are within 5-10 min walk of the hotel.  I was able to walk to/from the hotel to Trinity College, Dublin Castle, Christ Church, Temple Bar area.  The only time I needed a cab was the morning I started @ Kilmainham Gaol.  The concierge staff was very helpful before & during my stay with dining suggestions, and also pre-arranged a very good taxi tour of the city for the morning I arrived.  The included breakfast offered a great selection of both cold items (cereals, fruit, baked goods, juices, yogurts), and a number of prepared to order hot breakfasts.  I had both, along with a great cup of cappucino each morning, and it kept me going until the evening.  The only negative was that the room I had very carefully selected was unavailable when I checked in.  It was resolved later that day (after providing a copy of the email confirming the room location) and my things were moved for me.  However, when I arrived at 6:00 am from my overnight flight, I wasn't in the mood for an argument about the room I should have been assigned.  With the exception of the check-in error, the service was flawless, and the accommodations perfect for exploring Dublin.",4,2018,09,20
204,Overpriced and shabby,"Hotel is run down. Furniture, rugs, bathroom all need updating. Soundproofing is non-existant, loud slamming doors, easily hear noise in hallway, your neighbor next door and plumbing from above. Furniture is chipped, rugs are old and dirty. The experience doesn't match the hotel rate. Hotel should be charging half of what they do. I suspect they get away with this as there are many business travelers here from the US who likely have travel agency links or deals. If you are a leisure traveler or a business traveler with standards, pick another hotel- you'll be happy you did!",2,2018,09,19
204,nice introduction to Ireland,"Lovely room overlooking St Stephen's Park. Windows blocked the late night partying noises from the nearby pubs. Needed a triple room and the sofa opened into a bed. Would have given a 5 star rating, but the sofa bed was very uncomfortable. You could feel the bedsprings! That was the only drawback to the room.  Amenities were very nice.  Staff very friendly.  Loved the breakfast staff. Their smiles could light up the room. Doormen very helpful. Didn't go into the bar, but it looked very inviting. Walking distance to many nice spots. Nice introduction to Dublin.",4,2018,09,19
204,Lovely Stay,"Overall a lovely stay in convenient Dublin location, walkable to many restaurants, shopping and bars.  The bar service was great and the room was well furnished but a bit small.  Check in process was easy.",4,2018,09,18
204,Wonderful stay,"I can't say enough nice things about our stay. Everything ran like clockwork. The room was nice, the staff was helpful, GREAT shower! I would stay here again in a heartbeat. 

The only downside was breakfast. While the selection was nice and the food was good, the kitchen is a bit tricky. Every single dish ordered over a 3 day period had something missing from it- no bacon one day, no hasbrowns the next, no hollandaise, etc. The servers were always happy to correct the missing items, but as breakfast is a very busy affair, it took quite some time to see to that. ",5,2018,09,18
204,Nice hotel and close to the nightlife!,"The fitzwilliam hotel Dublin is a nice hotel and very close to all the Nightlife of Dublin. Its right across the street from the st Stephens garden, and walking distance to the Temple bar area. We loved our room with a balcony. ",5,2018,09,17
204,"Excellent Location, Service, and Stay","Stayed for one week on business.  It was very handy being steps from shops, bars, and restaurants when getting back in from a day at work and not wanting to go far for food or entertainment.  The staff and service made the stay comfortable and easy.  Would highly recommend staying here if you want to be steps from Grafton street.  Caveat, I was staying on business and the bill was paid by my company.  I don't know whether I would have shelled out to stay here on my own dollar because it is not the least expensive option in town, but it sure is nice for what you pay.",5,2018,09,17
204,Great Downtown Hotel,A perfect Hotel if you want to be downtown and close to everything and still have a 5 star experience. Rooms where very nice and the Breakfast was also very good. They have a restaurant and a bar on site also.  Service was also great  ,4,2018,09,17
204,Great hotel in the b2 est location,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights - very nice hotel, fantastic location, very nice staff all around.  One suggestion for them:  when the guests check in, it would be a good idea to ask them if they have an interest in booking a tea service, since there is a 24 hour minimum time for a reservation, without flexibility.  Also they should suggest a reservation at the fabulous restaurant, Glover's Alley.
The bar staff was particularly lovely, we really enjoyed chatting with them.
We will definitely stay here again!",5,2018,09,16
204,Mr Frank Bilancio,"My wife and I had the pleasure to stay the night of Sept 12th ,we were treated by the Hotel Staff wonderfully ,especially Laura who took great care of us in every way . She walked us thru the property and escorted us to the room personally . We enjoyed the room on the top floor. The hotel is nicely appointed and had a great bar . The Hotel Mgr Conrad is a gentleman and bid us farewell until the next time we visit Dublin 
I would cone back here to stay for sure ",5,2018,09,15
204,Everything about our stay was outstanding!,"We had a fantastic experience staying at the Fitzwilliam and absolutely loved all the staff that we met.  Our room was so inviting and comfortable, the breakfast was excellent, and the Concierge and Front Desk staff could not have been more accommodating. The location of this hotel is perfect and convenient to all that Dublin has to offer.  I would return to this hotel if we are in Dublin again and I highly recommend it.  A huge thank you to this wonderful staff who contributed to our excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam.

204,"Great location, restaurant, staff and breakfast",Its in a great location and wonderful staff from the moment we arrived. The food and service in Glovers Alley was second to none as was the breakfast. The bed was comfy just one small thing the freeze dried coffee sachets and long life milk in the room was an unwelcome surprise. We would stay again but please rectify this.,4,2018,09,11

204,Super Staff and Location,"We came back to Australia from our trip of four weeks in Ireland and England with my parents. 10/10 for location and staff.The bar manager Lewis is very funny and friendly. Jason and Jhon at the concierge were fabulous and excellent giving advice on what to do in the city, excellent dinner recommendation. Good location Shops, restaurants and bars around the hotel.",5,2018,09,05
204,Expensive Luxe in Dublin,"We finished our Ireland trip in Dublin and we loved our stay at the Fitzwilliam. We had checked into another hotel nearby which ended up being horrible and we quickly got on the phone with our Amex Concierge who got us a room within minutes at the Fitzwilliam. We were so grateful to check-in and the front desk staff and concierge were warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. We loved all of their recommendations and they assisted us with reservations at a nearby restaurant that was amazing! The room was very small but nothing unusual considering it was in the city. Despite being small, it was very luxurious and had every amenity that we needed. We loved their quiet bar and had pre-dinner drinks there almost nightly. While it is expensive, it was well worth it.",5,2018,09,04
204,the proper 5 star experience,"I was incredibly lucky to have to stay in the FitzWilliam hotel for work for one hell of a week, and incredibly the team in the hotel made sure that what could have turned out as incredibly stressing time into complete plain sailing (with the most helpful and friendly crew ever!). It felt like my mind was read at all times, by the time as I was asking for something to be done for us it was already sorted, made and possibly made even prettier with a bit bow :);  so I felt we were in great hands from the beginning, A big heartful thanks to Cormac, Patrick, Victor, Laura, Shauna and Gosia. Your attention to detail is second to none!",5,2018,09,03
204,Awesome!,"Great visit as we pass through Dublin. Laura provided outstanding service and was kind and professionalism, even getting us into a room a bit prior to check in time! Would recommend to anyone traveling to Dublin.",5,2018,09,01
204,Very Nice,"Great hotel right on St Stephens green - we had a roof top suite facing the green with an outside rooftop terrace - mistake really as the trams ring bells all the time - we had lunch and dinner in the bar and unfortunately it was just that, run of the mill bar food - some staff excellent some not so - cleaning team were not so good left dirty glasses in the room, took others away and did not replace, did not leave toilet rolls - a real class hotel let down by poor housekeeping and mediocre bar - I would add that the concierge and reception staff were second to none - very expensive for the overall level of service received",4,2018,08,31
204,Most welcoming,"This is the perfect location if you’re a shopaholic (or travelling with a shopaholic) as the hotel is right at the end of Graffton Street on the green. It’s also an excellent hotel if you love restaurants (walking distance from the Dax). Staff at the hotel were faultless, extremely helpful and most welcoming. Dublin has some wonderful hotels and this is certainly one of them - a lovely experience.",5,2018,08,31
204,Two Weeks in Dublin,"Came here to see the pope, research family, and see Ireland with my sister, but not in that order. 

Saw the pope- check. Researched the family-check. Saw more of Ireland with my sister- check.

The hotel?  I love it! This is my second time back. I love how close it is to Grafton Street, how I can walk to the NLI, Archeology and National Museums of Ireland  how close the hop-on-hop-off stop is to the front door to the hotel.  The bed is nice, the linens clean and not too itchy like other hotels that use organic cotton. Pillows could be a bit more firm, but maybe that’s just me. Breakfast is awesome, a bit too carb heavy, and the breakfast tea is BRISK!  I have had dinner in the bar, varying from just a cheese platter to fish and chips, a burger, and the Caesar salad. All was good. 

Prince would have loved this hotel for its use of purple.  

The staff are very friendly and want to make every moment of your stay enjoyable.   Hotel is quiet.  Bathroom has a rain shower head, but the shower curtain does not run the length of the tub, so no showers for two, unless you are both 2 years old. Ample closet space. 

I’ll be back!",5,2018,08,30
204,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location.","Beautiful hotel in an excellent location for both business and pleasure in Dublin.  Very friendly staff who were eager to help where required, with a good selection of breakfast options.  My room was spotless with excellent amenities.",4,2018,08,30
204,Excellent as ever,"Love staying at the Fitzwilliam, it never disappoints.  Great location, service is excellent (particularly the concierge parking) and the breakfast is superb.  Always a pleasure to stay here.  The view on to St Stephens Green is particularly nice.",5,2018,08,29
204,Excellent stay!,"The staff was wonderful, the room was lovley, the service was beyond our expectations!  The losactiom (right near St. Stephens Green) was perfect.  I highly reccomend The Fitzwilliam! We hope to return some day. ",5,2018,08,29
204,Dublin,"Hotel was in a great location and was everything we expected. We had a car and were able to park on site. Breakfast was included, and was very good with many options from a full Irish to a cold buffet.",5,2018,08,29
204,European Hotel next to Everything,"We went to Dublin for St. Patrick Day, we had a lot of fun and had a good stay at the Fitzwilliam.
As I stated in the title The Fitzwilliam is next to or a short walking distance to everything you want (and need) to do in Dublin. Short walk to the Temple Bar district, literally across the street from Trinity College and St. Stephen Green and a short walk to the shopping on Grafton St.
The rooms are very comfortable and extremely spacious for Europe. The best part of hotel was the gentlemen at the Concierge Desk.  I had written and asked several questions before we arrived and within 24 hours I had the most detailed Do's/Don'ts and must see list ever, THANKS! it was perfect. 
Looking forward to go back (next time when it is a little warmer).",4,2018,08,28
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel is just super!,"A wonderful, heartwarming hotel. The chow was super. We were part of a Tauck tour group and needed a place close by the Guinness Brewery. This is the place! Centrally located with easy walking everywhere. A very comfortable hotel near St. Stephens Green. And you MUST see Riverdance - it's close by. Thumbs up!",5,2018,08,28
204,Lack of consideration for people with disabilities,"My wife and I recently stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel and on checking out we went to get our car in the underground car park. While in the car park my wife wished to go to the toilet. There were toilets in the underground car park but she wished to use the disabled toilet which was locked. She had to use the ladies toilet which was quite inconvenient for  her. As she left the ladies toilet a staff member walked by and I asked why the disabled toilet was locked. He said it was company policy to lock the disabled toilet,, not the ladies and gents toilets, and if someone wanted to use it that the key was available from the reception which required getting the lift to the reception level and possibly queing for attention at the reception desk as we did some time before as we were checking. out. The staff member said if we wanted to pursue the matter we should take it up with management. We did not have time to go to reception to speak to a manager but I rang from my car and spoke to a manager who said that it was hotel policy to lock the disabled toilet.
This is completely unacceptable, if the hotel has a security issue with the toilets in the basement it would be quite easy to put a cc tv camera and a phone or button whereby a person wishing to use the disabled toilet could contact reception who could remotely open the door.
Our stay was soured by this problem.",3,2018,08,28
204,GOOD PLACE FOR A REUNION. GOOD FOOD,"Very centrally placed-on St Steohans green-70 yards from top of Grafton Street
We had a class reunion of about 70 people.
Aperitifs were taken on ground level
We were seated upstairs and this worked out fine.
Food/drinks were very good
Will recommend to everbody who only want a dinner reunion
because there is no sitting down area-view etc.",4,2018,08,28
204,Fantastic Irish Hospitality,"Wonderful hotel , fairly small but big on ambiance. Rooms are boldly decorated but have all the modern conveniences. Great staff and they even offer you an umbrella in case you are unprepared for the typical Irish weather!",5,2018,08,28
204,Wonderful,"I have just returned from this hotel and wanted to thank all the staff there for doing a great job.
The hotel is perfectly positioned to walk everywhere. The rooms are nice and comfy the breakfast is delicious and plentiful but most of all the staff are really friendly and helpful. If you are thinking of booking this hotel I would definitely recommend it.",5,2018,08,27
204,LOVE the Fitzwilliam!,"We arrived at the Fitzwilliam after an overnight flight from the states several hours before check-in. The staff was very accommodating, providing a place for my wife and I to freshen up and then stored our luggage for us until our room was made ready. In every encounter we had with any of the staff, they were friendly & helpful. Most everything we wanted to see and do in Dublin was within fairly easy walking distance and we truly enjoyed checking out the sights and sounds of the city. Our room was beautiful and up-to-date and we loved everything about our stay at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2018,08,27
204,Dublin,"Excellent location, staff and service.  Beautiful park right across the street as well as trains and busses nearby.  Great shopping and pubs right outside the hotel - everything you could need is within 5 blocks.",5,2018,08,27
204,Fitzwilliam Aug18,Great location right in the heart of the city n beside a luas stop.  Room ok for a 5star. Taps /plumbing were a bit noisy and old. Very friendly staff. Breakfast was ok again for a 5 star. I would go there again for the location ,4,2018,08,27
204,Perfect place to stay in Dublin !,"We stayed here for three nights. The service is simply perfect, helpful, smiling, nice. Can't do better. The bar is a place where you want to stay longer and the breakfast one of the best you can imagine. Only weak point : hous.keeping isway below the level expected in such a house. ",5,2018,08,27
204,"Great hotel, great location","Hotel and concierge superb; very, very nice and helpful. Great location by pubs and shopping. Walking distance to Temple Bar area and HOHO bus, and across the street from a lovely park.  Clean and comfortable, had courtyard view so very quiet. ",5,2018,08,26
204,Could be better for what we paid,"We recently stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Dublin.  We found this property on TripAdvisor and, given that the reviews were mostly positive, we decided to book.  It was not cheap, but we thought that if it was a great hotel, we were happy to pay.

The location is great.  It is located right across from St. Stephen's Green and close to a lot of restaurants and attractions.  Grafton Street and the St. Stephen's Green shopping centre is right next door and you can pick up the DoDublin bus to do your sightseeing from just around the corner.

Our room was quite large, for a European hotel room.  There were 3 of us and we did not feel cramped.  There was a front foyer to put your shoes and luggages, a large closet with drawers and safe.  There was a large work desk and a king sized bed.  There was a pullout couch that turns into a queen sized bed.  

The bed was very comfortable.  Sheets and towels were clean and without hair - always a good sign of a clean hotel.  There was a large window that you can open for fresh air, but then, you could hear everything from the street (our room faced the main street and it can get a bit noisy, even at night).  The bathroom had a shower and a separate bathtub.  The sink had very little counter space, so you couldn't really put your toiletry bags there.  It would have been nice to have a separate shelve or two.  There was a mini bar but if you picked up anything in the fridge, you will get charged for it, even if you don't consume it.  There was a kettle and some instant coffee and tea but no actual coffee maker, which we really missed.  A Nespresso machine or even a Keurig would have been appreciated.

We were only able to find 2 electrical outlets in the large room, which was not enough for our family of 3.  The internet is not secure, so beware esp. if you are doing banking etc.  The internet also cuts out on and off, esp at night.

The gym is VERY VERY small.  There were only 3 pieces of equipment in there and some weights.  We had to go to a nearby gym and pay extra to get a workout.  We expected better for a hotel of this caliber.

The staff seemed friendly enough, although we did not really interact with them much, other than checking in and out and having them order a taxi for us.

Although our stay was fine, I would probably look for another property next time with better value for my money.",3,2018,08,24
204,Good stay,"Excellent quiet position.  Very happy, helpful staff.  Lewis the barman, great.  Food very good.  Rooms 4 star, not 5 star.  Enjoyed our four day stay.  Location very good, facing St Stephens Park.  Would consider again when we return to Dublin",4,2018,08,23
204,Very Noisy ,"The staff were excellent and the room was of a good quality; however, the noise levels were totally unacceptable. My bedroom was to the front of the hotel and what a mistake that was. I was woken up on the hour every hour with road traffic and shouting noises from passing people. You can hear everything it is as if you are lying in the road. However good a hotel is the basic need is to have a good nights sleep and a room at the front of this hotel does not allow this. 

There is no point in responding to my review by offering your apologies for the hotel not meeting my standards and your intention to strive to do better. 

The windows are clearly failing or not of an adequate standard at the front of the hotel. The solution is not an apology but to replace the failing windows or add secondary glazing. It is not acceptable to expect people to sleep as if they were sleeping on a main road not in a 5 star hotel.

It’s a shame as the staff are excellent.",3,2018,08,22
204,Bad start-Happy ending,"We spent 4 nights total at the Fitzwilliam,we stayed 3 and came back for the fourth after being to the West coast. Our first evening started fine we booked a standard double room everything seemed in order. For a five star it was nice, however I've learned five star experience in countries differs greatly, and in my opinion sometimes Ireland's 5 stars leave a lot to be desired. The staff from the beginning were excellent, very friendly, attentive and efficient. Trying to shower the first evening we had issues with the shower being scalding hot,we called reception and they sent maintenance out immediately, unfortunately it wasn't fixed properly, we had the same issue the following morning. We complained to reception as we couldn't use the facilities, they rightfully and kindly gave us use of the day room while they upgraded us to a better room with a terrace and views or Stephens green(and a full functioning shower!) After the initial issue was sorted we were treated like royalty,they really made up for it! We were checked in on regularly,and not annoyingly. Definite 5 star standard in the end.",5,2018,08,21
204,My home in Dublin,"This hotel felt like home during my four day, solo trip to Dublin. I loved the location - close to everything, but quiet as it's away from Temple Bar craziness. I woke up and ran in St. Stephen's Green most mornings, then enjoyed a fantastic breakfast. I felt extremely safe here and had a wonderful time relaxing here at night. It was very quiet. The staff was wonderful and accommodating. I arrived very early morning after a red eye from NYC- like 6:30am- and they let me check in to my room right away, which set me up for a fantastic, full first day of sight seeing. Loved this hotel so much.",5,2018,08,20
204,Fabulous Location,"Beautiful Hotel on the doorstep of St. Stephens Green & Grafton St. Walking distance to Everything. Gorgeous friendly staff. Beautiful Purple decor which is very eye catching & very comfortable beds. Tey make a fabulous iced Virgin mohito in the bar, very tasty. They park your car for you, they greet you at the front door with a smile & all the staff are just wonderful. ~The general Manager is always around & is hands on, always friendly & nothing is too much or a problem for them. You could not get a better location to stay in Dublin. Love this hotel",5,2018,08,20
204,Delightful boutique hotel,"Wonderful boutique hotel, attentive and knowledgeable concierge and delicious breakfast.  The concierge was particularly helpful with dining recommendations and reservations.  The location was centrally located and an easy walk to most attractions and restaurants.   ",5,2018,08,20
204,Return visit,"Just returned from our second trip to Dublin, and stayed again at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Staff really are fantastic and a number rembered us from our last trip. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. The hotel is well situated and a great base for exploring the city.  The breakfast should not be missed. We plan to stay with them again next year. ",5,2018,08,20
204,"Fantastic location, trendy luxury","We were here one night as part of a trip through Ireland. Rooms were large and modern, with a welcome gift of Irish butter biscuits! The location can't be beat, steps from St. Stephen's Green and the heart of Dublin. Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,19
204,Lovely hotel,"Wonderful hotel! Staff is helpful, patient and friendly. Rooms are very pretty. Bar, restaurant excellent service. Food great quality. Easy to navigate the city from the hotel's location. Too notch concierge staff.  Definitely recommend.",5,2018,08,19
204,4 Nights in Dublin,"We stayed for four nights in the FitzWilliam hotel in Dublin in August 2018. My husband and I were on our honeymoon. All the staff was lovely and very helpful. We stayed in the Signature Room with a queen size bed, so nothing fancy but our room was very nice. We ate breakfast there at the hotel three times and they have a great menu. The hotel is right in the heart of everything, near lots of Pubs, St. Stephen's Green, Trinity college, and you are not far from River Liffey. ",4,2018,08,19
204,Excellent,"Stayed for one night, and it was after several days of fast changes, airport flights and railroads in France and England.  What a perfect refuge of calm and efficiency.  Everything was clean and well kept.  Breakfast was unexpectedly wonderful.  Service was A plus.",5,2018,08,19
204,Perfect location for the perfect Dublin experience!,6 day trip with family with Dublin as our hub and the Fitzwilliam was amazing. We found the location right off St Stephens Green and Grafton Street to be ideal. The staff was so kind and attentive. The bar and restaurant were excellent as well.,5,2018,08,18
204,5 star experience without the stuffiness,"We were greeted immediately at our taxi, with a smile and polite conversation. Our bags were handled and we were escorted to reception. Check-in was smooth and easy. We were escorted to our room and given a brief tour of the room. The staff was exceptionally kind and helpful, the room was spotless and spacious and the mini bar was fully stocked. The location can't be beat and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,08,16
204,Quality experience,"Stayed on several occasions with my partner, always welcomed with a smile, great front of house service. Lovely rooms and bathrooms and the breakfasts are hard not to overindulge on. Worth spending the little extra for that special occasion.",5,2018,08,15
204,"Central location, attentive service, quiet and comfortable rooms","Positives: Utterly perfect location close to everything so once you drop your car with valet, there's no hassles getting around. If you're doing any shopping, it's easy to drop your bags off in your room as you go so you're not weighed down with dragging stuff around. Similarly, if the weather changes you can nip in for a raincoat or to borrow a big hotel umbrella. Valet/door staff and front desk staff are extremely attentive and helpful. Afterhours security is really good. Atmosphere is an oasis of calm in the midst of the city hustle and buzz. Bed was firm and pillows extremely comfortable. Shower was powerful and bathroom lovely (be careful getting out... those lovely deep soaking tubs are a big step). Really appreciated having room AC as we had one of those rare hottish days. Room was well insulated for sound... no getting awakened by late night partygoers coming in and out in the hallways.

Not So Positive: Ordered room service breakfast twice and food was a bit disappointing. Rashers were too salty to eat, teapot small and not insulated, black n white puddings kind of 'meh'. If we'd not have been pushed for time, would have preferred local cafes. There were lots and lots of American guests so at times it felt as if we were back in the States. Service was excellent with one tiny complaint... I needed a taxi and rather than offer to order one, the woman at the front desk very helpfully referred me to the taxi app that pretty much everyone local in Dublin uses. Unfortunately this particular app doesn't set up if you don't have an Irish phone number. Room was very pretty, but showed quite a few signs of wear and tear in the corners, edges, etc. which didn't bother us, but I know some people get picky about these things (in fairness, I've noticed this at a fair number of higher end hotels... which makes me wonder what are guests doing to be so hard on the properties?).",4,2018,08,14
204,Awesome!,The staff was beyond friendly and accommodating! The staff was very attentive. The bartenders were great and gave us a lot of tips of what to do/see in Ireland. I would recommend for any of my friends or family to stay here. ,5,2018,08,13
204,Ireland Getaway,"Great Hotel - Fantastic location and great value.  Staff is accommodating and attentive.  Breakfast is excellent and satisfying.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Everything is within walking distance.
Excellent Irish Weekend!",4,2018,08,12
204,Great location and excellent staff,"We much enjoyed our 3-night stay here.  The location was excellent; we did a lot of sightseeing and were able to walk everywhere. Likewise with the different restaurants we had booked for dinner. The staff were friendly, professional and efficient and the few small issues we had in our room were very speedily sorted. Our room overlooking the inner courtyard was very quiet (apart from the occasional seagull!).  Our only slightly negative comments were that some of the furniture in our room was starting to look a little tired and we would also have appreciated a little more light for reading in the seating area. Breakfast was very good with lots of choice. Again the service was  efficient, helpful and friendly.",5,2018,08,12
204,Excellent Hotel,"Our family of 5 adults stayed here while in Dublin. From check in to check out  we were treated like royalty. Our suite was fantastic. 5 star luxury with no detail overlooked or missed. The staff  are gracious, courtesy, professional and so accommodating. Being right on St. Stephan's Green, steps away from Grafton Street was a treat! Our flight back to NY was early and at 6 am, they even had take away breakfast ready for us. Superior service, comfortable beds and rooms",5,2018,08,12
204,"Excellent Hotel, Staff & Service","We stayed here while in Dublin,
From arrival we were treated like royalty. Ever member of staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and catered for our every whim. 

The room was fantastic. Overlooking the St. Stephens Green area which an amazing view, 5 star luxury and completely spotless. 

The breakfast was delightful and we dined in the restaurant 2 nights. The food was perfect and very filling. 

From check in to check out every thing was perfect",5,2018,08,11
204,"Amazing service, perfect location","The Fitzwilliam is located a convenient walk to shopping and dining and lots of activities right in central Dublin.  If you are going to spend time in the city, this is a great location.  The concierge greats you warmly as you arrive and has lots of great advice on things to see and do in the area.  You will definitely want to enjoy the breakfast in the morning too before you head out.  Rooms face either Saint Stephens green or back towards the interior courtyard.",5,2018,08,11
204,Top notch accommodations!,"Could not have asked for a more enjoyable stay in Dublin. Super comfortable beds, great food, and helpful staff. Would highly recommend. Loved being near all great shopping on Grafton St. and a quick walk to the city center. ",5,2018,08,11
204,Very nice hotel centrally located,"We stayed in good and not so good hotels over the years...this is definitely one of the good guys. The rooms are thoughtfully designed and quality build, for those who appreciate that. All staff we interacted with were both professional yet courteous.
Little attentions like chocolate, bottled water and even fresh fruits made available were appreciated. Of course all of that is reflected in the rates you pay but they don’t have to do that...yet they do. The valet parking also added a nice touch.
We would highly recommend it if it’s in your price range, and we would absolutely go back.",5,2018,08,10
204,Our fab stay,"Can not fault the Fitzwilliam nHotel, Dublin. 
Accommodation was everything we expected and more, staff fabulously polite and helpful. I felt as if they cared. Really want to go back again and would recommend  to anyone.",5,2018,08,10
204,"Fantastic location, not a 5-star property ","The service and the staff at this hotel are top notch and 5-star, unfortunately the rest of the property doesn’t equal up. It burdens me to give low ratings to anything or anybody but as someone who has relied upon so many reviews over the years, I felt it was important to explain our experience. If you’re looking for a true five-star experience, I’d look elsewhere. The location is absolutely wonderful but the hotel needs some work. My main concerns were; no hot water running in the sink, and when you took a shower the drain was so slow that by the time you ended your shower, you were standing in about a half a foot of dirty bathwater. I notified the staff so they could fix the problems for the next guest. They were obviously very apologetic and concerned. I’m also including a picture of the halls. The hallways tended to be cluttered with housekeeping equipment and dirty dishes. My apologies to the wonderful people that work at the Fitzwilliam but I suggest dropping the rating to a four-star hotel or consider some serious changes.",1,2018,08,09
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel in Stephen's Green,"I have stayed here multiple times on business travel. The staff and hotel are lovely, everyone is always so friendly and accommodating.  Whenever traveling to Dublin, this is my hotel of choice and I stay here when possible. ",5,2018,08,09
204,Dublin Hotel,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin with easy walking distances to numerous Pubs and main attractions.  Staff was great and very helpful.  The rooms were spacious for relaxing after a day of touring.  Great breakfast.,5,2018,08,08

204,"Nice hotel, fantastic location.","Just beside Stephens park and near Cratfon street lies this nice hotel. We had asked for an uppgrade, a room with a balcany but something went wrong so we got a room without balcany. We had had a long day flying from Iceland, waking up in the middle of the night and was not in the mood of dealing with this. The room we got was nice on the second floor and was OK. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice...or even more...a fantastic staff and very good food. We loved that. Try also tea and scones on the first floor.",4,2018,08,06

+ nicely decorated, spacious-enough room
+ great water pressure in shower
+ central location 
+ great included breakfast on the mezzanine with an extensive hot menu made to order

204,Great staff,"We had a lovely overnight stay in this hotel it's in a great location opposite st Stephens green beside grafton st very central, our room was very nice.we had some delicious  cocktails served by very cheerful staff,we didn't  eat in the hotel so can't comment, I recommend fitzwilliam hotel and would probably  visit again.",4,2018,07,30
204,Great location in Dublin,"We had a lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The hotel has a somewhat modern vibe but a classic feel. The rooms were nicely appointed, and the bathrooms roomy by European standards. The staff was very gracious and helpful. 

Our room overlooked a courtyard and was quiet. Breakfast is included and offered quite a spread of pastries, breads, meats and cheeses, etc, along with several order off the menu items like omelets, eggs Benedict and the traditional Irish breakfast. 

It’s walking distance to dozens of pubs and restaurants. Also, the #7 stop on the Hop on Hop off bus is right around the corner. 

Ireland was in an unusual heat wave while we were there, and I’m not sure the common areas are air conditioned as the lobby and bar were almost too warm to enjoy (and we felt for the staff!). But the rooms have air conditioning, so our sleep wasn’t affected by the heat. ",5,2018,07,30
204,Will definitely return,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for one night. From start to finish the stay was amazing, 5 star experience. The hotel is beautiful, location is great and the food was delicious. But the most credit goes to the staff who were so friendly, professional and courteous. They were who made the visit so memorable. 
We will definitely stay in the future",5,2018,07,29
204,"Great service, Great staff, Great location.","I stayed at the FitzWilliam for 5 days and highly recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin. Not only is the location great, and my room very nice, but the staff was what put things over the top for me. They were incredibly helpful in making certain I had everything I need.",5,2018,07,29
204,Quiet Room in a Perfect Location,"I had stayed at a nearby grand hotel in the past, but found it too loud - the usual City Centre problems of traffic, revelers, Viking boat tours. So I had a few trepidations about picking another centrally located hotel. I needn’t have worried. The Fitzwilliam gave me a lovely quiet room facing their pretty courtyard and I had an excellent night of sleep. 

I was on the fifth floor in the corner, which meant I didn’t hear footsteps overhead, and the angle to the other windows meant that I had a lot of privacy without even closing the blinds. There are nice opaque roller shades that give privacy without blacking out the light, but there are also heavy blackout curtains if needed.

The location is wonderful, right on St. Stephen’s Green, with easy access to the Grafton Street shopping and restaurants. It’s also a short walk to Trinity College and the National Gallery. 

Now I have to say something about the outstanding service. I arrived a little after eight in the morning, planning to drop my bags off and check in later. They offered to register me, and amazingly had my room ready. Not only did they move me in right away, but they had somebody bring coffee up to my room without my even having to ask. 

The staff were so helpful, and genuinely seem interested and concerned in my wellbeing. Polina in particular was very kind and friendly. 

I wasn’t sure if I would like the decor after seeing it online, but in person the purple accents go over much better, as the room’s coloring is fairly placid overall. My room had a window seat with a large white orchid on the table next to it, fresh flowers in the bathroom, a gilded mirror, and an interesting vintage black and white photo on the wall. 

The bed was comfortable. There were plugs all over, including some by the bed if you like to plug your phone in next to you. The staff offered me an adapter when I checked in (I already had one, but it was nice that they offered). 

The bathroom was so spotless (not a speck of mildew anywhere) that I almost wondered if I were the first to inhabit the room. There was a huge, deep tub and an impressive rain shower. 

One of my favorite things about it was that, although the room had individual air conditioning, I never had to use it, as the very large window opened, allowing the pleasant Irish breezes to blow in.

To me, this place was heaven - but to be fair, there are a few tiny details that would make it even better from a functional point of view. (1) A soap dish on the sink counter (I used a paper coaster); (2) a way to open the window just a crack, or open from the top rather than a side hinge, so the rain wouldn’t come in and soak the window ledge; (3) the end of one of the blackout curtains was off its hangers, so it drooped and it was hard to get a seal against the light. But these are really minor things and were far outweighed by all the other thoughtful details. 

If you’re trying to decide between the Shelbourne and the Fitzwilliam, I’d have to say go with the Fitzwilliam. ",5,2018,07,29
204,Great Location,"Great location - easy walking distance to most local attractions. Great service. Very helpful with suggestions of restaurants, and local activities. Always available. Nice rooms, clean and comfortable. ",5,2018,07,26
204,Badly needs refurbishment,"We stayed at The Fitzwilliam as part of a 4 day stay in Dublin but unfortunately, we decided to check out early. The hotel is very dated and in dire need of a refurbishment. We had been allocated a room which we found small and very chipped furniture. There was even mould in the bathroom. The next room we were shown was not much better. Great location and pleasant staff just the hotel needs an upgrade to really be called 5 star.",2,2018,07,24
204,Lovely staff,"We stayed here at the end of a two week European adventure.  It's not the most posh hotel, but the location, cleanliness, and staff cannot be beat.  From the front desk and concierge to the restaurant and bar staff, we found everyone to be so friendly and helpful.  Additionally, it is within walking distance to many of Dublin's attractions such as Trinity college, St. Steven's green, high street shopping, Temple Bar area, and many others.  A great experience in Dublin.",5,2018,07,23
204,Great City break Hotel,"Myself and my wife stayed here on two occasions this year for a short city break at Christmas and Easter. The hotel has everything you would expect of a 5 star but it's the extra touches that separates it from the other 5 stars in the vicinity. The staff are so friendly and helpful and nothing is an issue. When we checked in the lady at reception walked us to our room and just chatted to us about our plans for the weekend and the facilities the hotel has. That evening a complimentary gift (scented candle) was randomly dropped into our room by a member of staff (I think because we were returning visitors). Never had that in a hotel before! 
The location of the hotel is perfect, situated at the bottom of the main shopping street/area and across from St Stephen's Green. Our room had a balcony over looking the green which was amazing. 
We didn't have dinner in the hotel but the breakfast was excellent.
When you are paying for a 5 star hotel you want to feel like it's really been worth and that was the case both times we stayed here this year.",5,2018,07,23
204,Ireland trip,"Loved, loved, Ireland. The people, the hotels, the country was absolutely beautiful. Thank you fro such an amazing trip. Every penny was worth it. Making memories. Thus was a graduation gift for our daughter. So glad this was our destination 
",5,2018,07,22
204,Great Location,"The hotel was nice with a helpful staff.  Excellent location for walking around Dublin!  The only concern I had was that there were not outlets on both sides of the bed, which made charging my phone while also using it as an alarm clock nearly impossible.  This was something I wish I had known prior to staying here.",4,2018,07,21
204,Classy hotel,"Impressive hotel with great modern rooms in traditional style.  Location is great, beds are comfortable and the people friendly. Breakfast is a nice buffet selection. Perfect for my short business trip.",5,2018,07,21
204,Just Ok,So there is nothing really wrong with the Fitzwilliam other than being a bit shabby and in need of an update.  Rooms to the front are noisy with the club right below.  The staff is friendly and the breakfast is very nice.  I feel it is a bit overpriced considering the shape of the rooms but the location is very good.  ,3,2018,07,20
204,Just an amazing place to stay,"The staff was very hospitable and location of the hotel is perfect for access to Grafton St and all it has to offer.  Very clean, very comfortable.  Easy to get to rooms which were very nice - bathrooms were always kept clean.",5,2018,07,19
204,Lovely Hotel!,"We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel right in the heart of Dublin. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The concierge service helped us get a shuttle to Johnnie Fox's which saved us a lot of money. The room was clean and very comfortable. I loved the large soaking tub and the chocolates on our bed each night. We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and found a beautiful fruit plate with , happy anniversary written in chocolate  was waiting when we arrived. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in Dublin.",5,2018,07,18
204,Lovely stay,"Clean, comfortable and stylish rooms. Great location on St Stephen's Green - Grafton, museums, Trinity, Temple Bar are all within easy walking distance.

204,"Great location, small rooms.","Location is amazing, but rooms are very very small. Very clean and nice staff. Furniture could us a little upkeep. You are definitely paying for location here. 
Nice bar with friendly staff. Loved how easy it was to walk out and get taxi and public transit. ",4,2018,07,17
204,Great hotel,"Great hotel! Contributed massively to my weekend away with my boyfriend. Concierge helped organise taxis, reception allowed a late check out (free of charge) and the location of the hotel was 10/10. Minutes away from top quality restaurants and shops! X",5,2018,07,16
204,Superb Service in a Perfect Location,We visited Dublin as tourists and stayed for 3 nights. We had a perfect stay at the Fitzwilliam and enjoyed every minute of the stay. The staff service was excellent and the hotel sat right on the best walking streets of Dublin.,5,2018,07,16
204,Luxury hotel without the fuss!,"My parents and I had a relaxing stay at this lovely hotel that truly exudes Irish hospitality. After a three week journey this was the perfect last stop to relax. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were comfortable and attractive. The luxury was there but in a low key manner. No fuss but still five star service. The location is perfect. I shall certainly return. Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2018,07,16

204,Excellent stay!,"Stayed for a week with my family.  Hotel is in a great location, close to shopping/dining/St. Stephens Park.

It was very warm when we were there and the A/C worked perfectly.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,07,15
204,Wonderful stay,"We finished our trip to Ireland in Dublin and this was the perfect hotel.  The location was central to a main shopping/dining area and the service was excellent.  We were there at an unusually warm period, but were very pleased that the A/C adjusted to 17 degrees Celsius in the room.  Several other hotels did not have efficient A/C, so this was a big plus!",5,2018,07,14
204,"Great service, great breakfast, great location","Ideally located in Central Dublin, in walking distance to a lot of must-see attractions.  I booked a vacation package to London/Edinburgh/Dublin through Costco in December 2017 and they picked this hotel.  I would stay here again on my own without hesitation, and would recommend it to friends.  The breakfast was great, the room was quiet, bed was comfortable, and the location was ideal.",5,2018,07,14
204,loved the hotel...but not the wifi,"Excellent location in central Dublin. Walk to Trinity and Temple Bar. Wonderful staff. Premium restaurant in Glover’s Alley. Beautiful view of park across street. But, WiFi slow and unreliable. Be aware of this issue if you are a major user of WiFi.",5,2018,07,14
204,great hotel,The Fitzwilliam is in a great location and the staff is terrific. We had an issue with our room and the staff  took very good care of us.  The rooms are quiet and comfortable. We got a room overlooking St. Stephens Green with a balcony. It was relaxing to read out there or just watch the world go by. We will definitely stay there again.,5,2018,07,14
204,Fantastic Stay at the Fitzwilliam,"We recently completed an 8-day stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin. We selected this hotel primarily for its excellent location on St. Stephen’s Green, and the location was indeed ideal. Their rooms were well appointed and comfortable although a bit small. More importantly, we were absolutely blown away by the level of service provided by almost every hotel employee we encountered.  Staff at the front desk, concierge desk, breakfast cafe, and housekeeping were universally helpful, friendly and genuinely eager to assist. I would particularly commend Patrick, the Head Concierge, who truly went above and beyond expectations to be of help and to make our stay memorable. 

The Fitzwilliam is definitely amazing, and there is no doubt that I will stay there again on any return to Dublin.",5,2018,07,12
204,Wonderful place on a slightly higher budget,"Concierge, front desk, bar were all fabulous. All staff were incredibly helpful. Room was pristine, with a nice little balcony overlooking the green. Bit pricy, but great location and stay for what I was looking for. ",5,2018,07,11
204,Thank you Fitzwilliam Staff,"Our experience was over the top from the moment we stepped in the door at the Fitzwilliam. Louis and the bar staff were great, the front door staff is second to none, and Nelly in reservations is fantastic. We could not have asked for a better experience and will stay at the Fitzwilliam when we go back to Dublin. 
Thank you Fitzwilliam staff you went out of your way for four days to make our day and it is greatly appreciated!!!.

204,Central Location with great staff,"The hotel is centrally located right next to St. Stephen's Green. You are at the top of Grafton Street and can walk to many of the major attractions. You are also right across from the Luas Station. 

Their staff was very friendly. The night manger who was still on desk when I checked in early was so accommodating in finding an open room for me to check in early to. It made such a difference to have someone who cared for their guests. 

The room itself was nice with a comfortable beds and black out curtains. The bathroom looked well maintained and was very clean. Overall had a great experience and would go back.",5,2018,07,10
204,Great city hotel ,Spent two days at the hotel in Dublin. It’s in an excellent location right in city center. The breakfast at the hotel was very good. The rooms are big and very comfortable. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I recommend this hotel ,4,2018,07,09

204,St Stephens Green,"This is a full service hotel in a location that can’t be beat.  Many restaurants,shops and other attractions of Central Dublin are in easy walking distance of this great facility.  The staff are very friendly and helpful in the finest Irish tradition. The rooms are clean, well-furnished and spacious, especially considering it’s downtown location.   A great base for a stay of any purpose in Dublin",5,2018,07,06
204,Great Hotel in Dublin,"My family and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights in a one bedroom suite. When we checked into the hotel (a bit too early from a long flight), our room was not yet ready. The staff was able to locate a room for us to rest and shower and then moved us to our proper room. For that, I am forever thankful because our kids were falling asleep sitting up in the lobby. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. We were very happy to have AC since Ireland was experiencing a heat wave. The breakfast was good and the waiter was lovely, really over the top kind. I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.",5,2018,07,06
204,Comfortable & attractive,"Comfortable and attractive with outstanding service and an unbeatable location.  The staff couldn’t have been more helpful and lovely.  Breakfast had a lot of variety.  Unfortunately, I had to spend a lot of time in the business center, which is a small, 2-PC room in the basement.  Small quibble about the claim to be “green.”  Towels were replaced no matter where I put them and the shower had torrential water pressure, with no way to adjust it.",4,2018,07,03
204,Felt Like Home,This is my first trip to Dublin and it brought back memories of the earlier days of Toronto. I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and it was truly magnificent. The staff was totally polite and courteous. They even have a door man that opens the door for you which makes you feel pretty special. The location is close to the downtown which makes it very convenient to explore the city. I would highly recommend this place to any tourist visiting Dublin.,5,2018,07,03
204,Check in if you value customer service and location! ,"Wow! What an excellent customer service experience. We arrived from the states- a family of six- tired and cranky. The staff at The Fitzwilliam arranged for us to have a room to rest in for the children to recuperate. That was so over the top helpful. We then were offered three lovely rooms for the balance of our stay. Each was spacious and well appointed. Shauna who assisted us went above and beyond in her customer service. We truly felt like the most important guests in the hotel. We admit that the location on the square can be loud if your room faces the street. The rooms on the interior courtyard are more quiet. However, a short walk to anything you desire, Grafton Street, the shops and restaurants on the Green, even Temple Bar make the Fitzwilliam so ideal. We decided on a whim to go to Belfast. The concierge arranged everything. Marcin is incredible! A rental car, AND for the Fitzwilliam in Belfast to welcome us upon arrival. A black cab tour was also arranged. What a great day and we always felt well taken care of! A 5 star experience. We will definitely make staying here a priority anytime we return to Dublin. Highly recommended and cannot say enough about the quality of the people! ",5,2018,07,02
204,Ireland trip,Loved the location.  Staff was esp helpful. We only stayed one night and left early so we didn't get to check out the restaurant or bar. Wish we had stayed here at the beginning of our trip.  Would definitely stay here again or recommend to others.,5,2018,06,27
204,Great stay in Dublin!,"Great staff, ideal location, clean rooms, and nice ambience.  Higher end without being stuffy.  Breakfast is outstanding.  Bar staff is very accommodating, as is concierge, front desk, and a food service manager (Kevin) that went out of his way to make recommendations for dining in another town that we were travelling to in Ireland.  One of the best of the 7 hotels my family of five stayed at while in Ireland.",5,2018,06,27
204,A Lovely Stay,"The location is perfect!  We were able to catch the Hop On Hop Off bus right outside the hotel and it was an easy walk to the other pick up locations for longer day tours.  It was an easy walk for Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College and Merrion Square.  It may seem like the room rates are a bit higher but the location can't be compared.  The staff could not have been more professional and friendly. We had a room with a balcony overlooking St. Stephen's Green and it was a nice way to start the morning or end the evening.",5,2018,06,27
204,Very good.,"This is a lovely modern hotel with bright rooms.  Breakfast was good, large range of options and hot food cooked to order. Great location opposite St Stephen’s Green. Staff are very professional and manage to balance this with appropriate friendliness.  ",5,2018,06,26

204,Best service in Dublin ,"I usually stay at the Westbury when in Dublin which I can’t fault, as I like the old world charm, however a colleague suggested I try here.

I have to say I was a bit disappointed when I arrived, the hotel public areas and my room were all very standard. Clean, tidy, well stocked etc but nothing exceptional.

However, 2 things would make me return here. Everyone, and I mean absolutely every member of staff I met over my 3 days had a big smile and made an effort to say hello and ask how I was. So much so it was noticeable.The staff could not do enough for you.

The second reason was the breakfast that was exceptional

So for those 2 reasons alone I will now put this on my rotation and recommended hotels in Dublin. 

If you want the best service in Dublin stay here!

204,Dublin trip,"Overpriced.  Room was clean and comfortable but front office staff could be better trained.  Our room was not ready went they said it would be, I had to ask to get my luggage delivered and our room rate was misquoted when we asked to extend our stay.",3,2018,06,22
204,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"I would highly recommend this hotel for its location and friendliness of the staff, shops and restaurants are very accessible and the room has every amenity required. car park at rear is also very convenient ",5,2018,06,21
204,Impressed!,"The staff at the Fitzwilliam Hotel were excellent - professional, courteous and invested, it added hugely to our stay. The hotel is very well managed and shows real attention to detail. The location is also excellent. ",5,2018,06,21
204,Excellent Service,"Hotel was ideally located and all staff were very friendly and cheerful.  The rooms were spotless; beds were comfortable.  Did not eat in hotel or have a chance to visit the bar, but the bar looked very inviting and lively.  Excellent service all around.  ",5,2018,06,20
204,A great hotel in a good location,"We stayed two nights at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin.  It has a very good location with many, many shops and restaurants in easy walking distance.  It has very nice rooms and features several restaurants and bars in the hotel.  It also features one fine dining restaurant with an excellent tasting menu.",5,2018,06,20
204,"Central location, hotel has all the services, good restaurant","We stayed at Fitzwilliam for four days a the end of a two-week Ireland tour where we stayed in four different Irish Inns. We walked to places of interest: down Dawson to find the green phone booth, and to the Sweny's Chemist shop on Lincoln Place. We passed the Huguenot Cemetery nearby, but did not take time to examine it. Often we ate in the bar at Fitzwilliam Hotel for our dinner, and found the food good, without much of a wait. Our room was quiet, and looked out over an inner courtyard.",4,2018,06,18
204,Wouldn't stay anywhere else,Amazing experience from start to finish. Nothing is too much trouble. So friendly and attentive. The dining experience in Glovers Alley was superb beyond words! Can't wait to return. Won't be staying anywhere else!,5,2018,06,18
204,Very good a few minor things ...,"More outlets in room please. Rooms are expensive but perhaps that is typical of a 5 star hotel.
Bar service is excellent! Server was beyond great! She was very knowledgeable about the different types of wine and drinks .. made our last night in Dublin a very wonderful experience! Also the bellhop was superb and the gentleman that helped me with my light fixture.",4,2018,06,18
204,Overpriced and bad room,"Perhaps the overprice due to our travel agent who booked this 2 months ago.  Location is great.  Room is tiny for one person and priced for 2.  Shower alternates between super hot and freezing with no control; inside steep bathtub.  They claim it is an ""upgrade"" but hard to know from what ---if there is a worse room I'd be glad not to see it.  Breakfast is the only bad meal we had in Ireland in a week - though serving staff wonderful",3,2018,06,17
204,Beautiful hotel property; central location; fantastic staff,"Highly recommend the Fitzwilliam to others for Dublin stays.  It was quite nice with excellent/comfortable rooms and a most helpful staff from the front desk to the concierge to the wait staff at breakfast.  The rooms were air conditioned, and given the unseasonably warm temps during our stay in May, 2018, it made all the difference in our level of comfort.  It was a short walk to Trinity College and plenty of good restaurants and shopping near-by.  A stop for the the hop-on/hop-off bus in Dublin was a half-block from the hotel and that got us everywhere we needed to go.  If there's anything misleading in their site pictures it's the pictures of views of the beautiful St Stephen's Green park across the street, suggesting a roof-top terrace or some other common area accessible to all guests.  In reality, those pictures are taken from patios of hotel rooms, so unless you happen to be staying in those rooms, there is no park view.  In fairness, our view was to a courtyard on the rear of the property which was lovely.  The doorman acknowledged that many hotel guests asked -- as we did -- whether there was a rooftop bar/restaurant.",5,2018,06,14
204,"Perfect location, great service and very clean !",Love this hotel. But on this trip I didn't sleep well due to a very firm bed and a leaking faucet.. I stayed in room 211. I also stayed in room 205 which had a great view and was very comfortable. Love the staff. Extremely helpful and friendly,5,2018,06,13
204,Always stay,I always stay in this Hotel when in Dublin. The staff are genuinely helpful and friendly. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. If you are lucky enough to get a front facing one then the view over St Stephens green is good. However the ones at the back look over gardens which is also very good. Over all the perfect hotel when staying in Dublin,5,2018,06,13
204,First class hotel.,"First class hotel . Location was great, walking distance to all the sites. Clean modern . The breakfast was outstanding. Dublin is expensive but the hotel was worth it.  Staff very friendly and helpful.",5,2018,06,10
204,Afternoon Tea,I went with my friends for an Afternoon Tea at Fitzwilliam Hotel. I have to say it was one of the best teas I've ever had. A lot of us in the group were vegetarians. We were all individually catered for. The selection of teas were amazing. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to our dietary requirements. Will definitely be back again with family this time.,4,2018,06,08
204,Dublin trip,Hotel staff were professional and helpful. Beautiful lounge area with a fireplace. Rooms were average and decor seemed dated dispite being recently renovated. Shower was awkwardly placed so it would spray out and water could leak out onto carpet. It is in a fantastic location. ,4,2018,06,07
204,Business hotel,"The experience here is typical of a USA style chain hotel, don't expect and exceptional features the staff are good and efficient.  I returned to my room during my stay to find a large box placed at the foot of my bed, I called the reception and after a number of calls over and back a guy came and the box was removed as it was not mine.  I was not offered an explaniation",2,2018,06,07
204,When in Dublin....................,"This property is perfectly situated.  The service is tremendous from the front office to housekeeping.  The staff have a great sense of humour, a must when travelling, the amenities in the room are lovely and when looking for a restaurant recommendation, they are brilliant.",5,2018,06,06
204,Excellent location,"Loved our stay, even though it was only for one night. Centrally located right on St Stephens Green, and close to shops and restaurants....which was extremely important for the short stay.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful. A small boutique hotel, modern décor, high quality, and comfortable.  ",5,2018,06,03
204,Awesome hotel,"I would highly recommend this hotel. Beautiful, clean, staff was extremely helpful & nice. Breakfast was excellent. Close to walk way, shops, pubs. If you are looking for a place to stay in Dublin this is it! ",5,2018,06,03
204,5 star service,"Rooms were clean and well maintained. Very comfortable beds with feather pillows, so I had a great nights sleep! All the other facilities are great, but the best part of the hotel is clearly the staff! Very warm, friendly and helpful. They are a real credit to the hotel!!",5,2018,06,03
204,A great stay in Ireland!,"The Fitzwilliam has it all.  The staff is accommodating, friendly and courteous.  The rooms are nice and very clean.  The location is perfect.  We will definitely return to this hotel on our next trip to Dublin,",5,2018,06,01
204,Wonderful Dublin Hotel,"The FitzWilliam is an ideally located hotel near great shopping, dining, and touring. The staff from check in to food service went over an above to meet our every need. We arrived about 10 a.m. from the US and even though check in is normally 3 pm, we had a room by 11:30 and free breakfast during our wait.  We had a late request for a day tour which Patrick, the wonderfully professional concierge, helped us with, resulting in a truly special day touring the Irish countryside with an experienced certified guide. 
I travel frequently and must say the team at the FitzWilliam is as good or better than any other hotel I have stayed in anywhere.
The rooms are quiet, well appointed, and well kept up.  I cannot find fault with any portion of the stay and would absolutely only stay here if we return to Dublin in the future.
",5,2018,05,31
204,Exceptional Service,Excellent location and the staff was amazing. I can’t say enough about the concierge team and their desire to go out of their way to assist in any questions you could possibly have. They even offered to stamp and mail our postcards at no cost. ,5,2018,05,30
204,You'll want to stay here!,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin is centrally located on St. Stephens Green, close to shopping, tourist attractions and many of the tourist attractions.  The staff is gracious, helpful and very kind.  While our room was a bit small, this was more than made up for by the location, excellent (5 star) staff.  Breakfast is a delight each morning.  The staff is a good as the food!  This is definitely a first choice for lodging if you're staying in Dublin.  I've never submitted a TripAdvisor review, but felt compelled to do so because this hotel was so nice!",5,2018,05,29
204,A nice stay,We stayed for our last night in Dublin. The staff were very nice. The room was lovely and it was the only hotel in Ireland that seemed to have working air conditioning. The breakfast was just so so compared to other hotels we stayed but other than that it was great!,4,2018,05,27
204,"Great Location, Great Hotel, Great Staff","Enjoyed my stay here, great location, staff very friendly especially in the bar.

Stayed overnight even though I live in Dublin. Great breakfast. Right beside Grafton Street and St Stephens Green for visitors.",5,2018,05,27
204,4 Days visit in Dublin,"Our arrival at the Fitzwilliam Hotel was perfect. The Hotel Staff was very friendly and helpfull, so that our stay in Dublin was very agreable. For breakfast we had a large choice and in the bar the staff was very kind. We want to thank especially the Concierge staff for all their help and informations.  ",5,2018,05,26
204,Enjoyable,A totally enjoyable stay in a great area of Dublin. All services were top notch and convenient to be able to tour the city. Wish we had stayed another day to enjoy more of the busy city. Note about city — all shopping and sights close a up early but are beautiful.,5,2018,05,25
204,Great people.  Great location. Poor hotel.,"This is difficult to write because all the staff were exceptional but they can’t be responsible for turning a very poor hotel into a good one.  Don’t spend your money here.  We were given an “upgrade” and can’t figure out what was upgraded and hate to imagine what we would have had otherwise.  The bathroom was dirty and had mold all over the grout in the shower.  There were suspicious white stains on the window seat cushion.  The mattress was shot.  I could feel springs.  There was a light hanging in the middle of the path to the bed so my husband had to duck.  We could hear every door closing in the other rooms.  
So....the staff moved us to another room and it overlooked St. Stephen’s Green.  Great but be aware that there is a trolley stop right outside and a constant alarm goes off each moment the trolley is at the stop...both directions.  This room was a bit better. I’m posting photos of the poor cleaning in the shower....dirt and mold. In each room there was almost no space for clothes. They had filled all 3 cupboards with a CD player, a minibar and a coffee machine.  The bed was awful.  The mattresses need replacement.  
Until someone who understands the minimum comfort a patron needs comes in and fixes this place, avoid it.  As an aside, the breakfast service is bad...lots of non English speaking servers who just can’t get it right.  Food was ok.
Too bad about this because the staff is TOP NOTCH....they deserve better.",2,2018,05,25
204,Very disappointed,"Stayed two nights at the Fitzwilliam and very disappointed. During our two week trip to Ireland and the UK, we stayed in some exceptional properties (London, Edinburgh, Cork, Killarney) and the Fitzwilliam was not even in the same class. The room was small, and the shower/bathroom was not clean. There was mold on the tile and caulk in the shower. This was mentioned to the front desk staff but not addressed. I sent an email with photos to the manager and never heard back. Would strongly recommend staying somewhere else.",3,2018,05,24
204,"Average hotel, nice location","Not a bad hotel, but not the best I have seen either
The shower and bath were excellent
Great water pressure really stood out. The bath was deep and water was hot
Loved it
FoiF quality and bar service was average",3,2018,05,24
204,Expedia Beware,"There’s not a bad thing to be said about this hotel.  The location is perfect, the service amazing, the breakfasts are great.  We especially appreciated Kevin’s hospitality.

BUT...whenever I book a hotel through Expedia, I get the feeling that I’m a second class citizen.   This time it was a low room with a garden outside so that people could actually walk by your room.  It wasn’t the nicest room.

Having said that, I would stay here agin in a flash!",5,2018,05,22
204,Review,"Great location and helpful staff.  Rooms are a little tired but clean and comfortable.  We walked to many locations from the hotel.  Breakfast was included and tasty - the staff prepared a to go breakfast when they heard we had a very early departure.  
",4,2018,05,21
204,Excellent,"First Class hotel and excellent location, staff all friendly and happy to help. Tram stop just outside the hotel if required and 5 min walk to Temple Bar. Room was clean and plenty big enough for a couple.",5,2018,05,21
204,Stay elsewhere.,"Positives:
Staff are friendly.
Location is prime (Luas stop across street, bus stop very nearby).
Housekeeping is excellent.
Air conditioning (though we did overhear other guests complain about non-functional air conditioning).
Bathroom was good (clean, great water pressure, larger bath tub, robes provided)
Lighting was good in the room, easy to control in multiple places.
Bed was comfortable.

Negatives:
Limited space rooms.
Limited power outlets in rooms, no adapters provided.
Rooms are dated.
Overpriced for amenities provided.
Location means any time you'd like to drive to hotel, you have to drive around St. Stephens Square and valet is inefficient as a result.
Doors slam shut and can be heard down the hall as guests arrive late in the evening, interrupting sleep.

We only made one request for the duration of our stay, which was to have our car ready out front on the day of check out at a specific time. This was not done and no service recovery attempt was made.

Would we stay here again? No. Not at the price point. ",3,2018,05,15
204,Excellent Stay,"We stayed in Dublin for four nights, and were very pleased with the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  They were very accommodating.  We arrived on a very early flight and they were able to get us into a room right away so we could take a quick nap after traveling before starting our day.  The staff members were great and really helpful.  The room was very clean.",5,2018,05,14
204,Just book it.,"Fantastic staff, customer service and area. Made me feel welcomed and everyone was helpful. Room was comfortable and the bed was made for sleeping! Loved the amenities. Breakfast had a lot of choices as well. Highly recommend.",5,2018,05,14
204,Superb at all levels," A hotel experience not to be missed. Friendly, sincere, and authentic staff from the doorman through check out,  with rooms that cannot be beat. Treat yourself to a room with the terrace and enjoy the view from this magnificent hotel. ",5,2018,05,14
204,Fabulous!,"A five star recommendation for this wonderful hotel!  The location across from St Stephens Green was convenient to everything we wanted to do. The rooms were very spacious, comfortable and clean. The breakfast buffet was delicious and extensive. The best thing about this hotel however was the staff. They could not have been more friendly, helpful and accommodating to us!  We arrived earlier than expected but that was no problem at all. Our luggage was checked, we were escorted to breakfast and given several great suggestions for the day. This was the perfect start to our vacation and we hope to someday return!",5,2018,05,13
204,Beautiful Hotel in Dublin,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is located in an ideal spot on St. Stephen's Green just a short walk from Grafton Street. The lobby is beautifully decorated and features a fireplace. We stayed in a Deluxe Premium room with a view of the Green (room # 307) and it was a great experience. The room was spacious. The bed was very comfortable. The sitting area next to the window was a perfect spot to unwind with a glass of wine after a busy day of sightseeing. The bathroom was posh with a big tub for soaking and a separate shower stall. The only slight drawback is that it is challenging to regulate the temperature of the water in the shower. The staff at the front desk and the bellmen were all very friendly, helpful and service oriented. We would definitely stay at this hotel again when we return to Dublin.",5,2018,05,13
204,# Day Dublin,"Came for a stop over on the way Adare. The staff was incredibly pleasant and helpful. Service was superb. Room was a bit on the small side for my taste. And was located on the street side which was a bit noisy at times. 

The location could not have been better. Walking distance to just about anything we wanted to see or do in downtown. With public transportation nearby.",4,2018,05,12
204,Great location,"What a lovely hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are spotless, modern and the bed was so comfy. The room has everything you need and would expect of a 5* Hotel. The location is great. Would defiantly stay here again. Dublin is a great place to visit ... can’t wait to return. ",5,2018,05,11
204,"Beautiful hotel, great location.","The Fitzwilliam Hotel is in a great location, right on St Stephens Green and centrally located at the top of Grafton street so close for shopping or sight seeing. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff were extremely friendly and we ate in the bar and it was delicious! If I have one quibble it would be that the cooked Irish breakfast didn't taste like it was freshly cooked but was still ok. The buffet breakfast on the other hand was delicious and varied. Would definitely stay again. 
Noise levels were low considering it was in a busy city centre.",4,2018,05,11
204,"Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin City center","Very nice hotel, contemporary and very well serviced. Almost all amenities are available in both, the hotel and rooms. Staff are well trained and professional. Food quality very good but very limited if vegetarian or vegan. Rooms are compact, a little small for a five star property. Excellent location - Centrally located. ",4,2018,05,10
204,Fine Fitzwilliam,Stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for 3 nights on a Family trip to Dublin. The Hotels rooms and amenities were very modern and luxurious. The Hotel staff were some of the most pleasant and welcoming I have ever experienced and the service excellent.  The atmosphere in the Hotel was relaxed and homely. The location is probably one of the best in Dublin on St. Stephens Green within a minutes walking distance of shopping Malls and good bars and restaurants. The LUAS tram line which goes around the town stops in front of the Hotel which made it very easy to move around and connect to Coach terminals for onward travel outside Dublin and to the airport. ,4,2018,05,09
204,Our Dublin stay at the Fitzwilliam,"We had a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The breakfast service was delicious and plentiful.  Really appreciated that it was in walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar area and right across the street from St. Steven's Green.",5,2018,05,07
204,A Perfect Hotel with Exceptional Concierge,Our stay at The Fitzwilliam was perfect. It stood apart due to the exceptional assistance of Concierge Marcin who recommended tours we would not otherwise have been aware which enriched our experience.,5,2018,05,07
204,Great little hotel,"Situated right in the city center just off Grafton street and across from Stephens green park is this small modernized hotel, with professional and helpful staff. The rooms are tastefully designed with lovely details that make the difference. The bed I found extremely comfortable with great pillows. Would happily return.",5,2018,05,04
204,Best in Dublin,"This was our second stay, and this time we spent one night at both the beginning and end of a trip through Northern Ireland (we flew in and out of Dublin). The staff are competent, friendly, and amazingly helpful. We had a one bedroom suite and it was a perfect size for a family of four. The only drawback was that it was a bit of a hike to get up to the top floor where our room was, but the payoff was worth it. Attention to detail was everywhere during our stay, and the location can't be beat.",5,2018,05,04
204,Lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam,Just took a short trip to Dublin with my friend and had a great stay at this hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. Found the bed very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and I can’t say enough about the staff. Both the front desk and concierge were so helpful and accommodating. The location is extremely central and it is very easy to walk most places from the hotel. I would absolutely stay there again.,5,2018,05,03
204,fitzwilliam in dublin,"personally like the riu gresham better, but this was nice as well, i guess im more of a cozy person and this is a more contemporary hotel, no complaints, just not my favorite, having said that, VERY well located!lots to do nearby",5,2018,05,03
204,Excellent high end hotel in perfect location,"Stayed here a few times now. Noticed they have lifted things to the next level in lots of small touches.
The rooms were great and a proper size bathroom. Lovely luxury towels and a proper bath.
Very tasty breakfast options.
Mostly though it was the service of the staff. Nothing too much trouble. Would be my preferred option if / when I return to work in Dublin.",5,2018,05,02
204,Good hotel,"Good hotel, but not qualified to 5 stars. Excellent service, but double room, I guess standard one, bed was too narrow for two. Excellent location in the middle of Dublin, walking distance to restaurants and bars.  ",4,2018,05,02
204,"very noisy,","The room was very small, no lift, very loud and strange noise all night, couldn’t sleep at all, staff was very friendly, but not professional, no room on arrival, couldn’t find our suitcases,was expecting much more for the money we’ve paid. ",2,2018,05,01
204,Excellent 5 Star Experience,"I stayed overnight in the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin last weekend with my partner for a significant birthday. The staff could not have been more accommodating. The car was taken off us and parked on arrival, we were checked in right away by a lovely lady, who showed us to our room. We had a bottle of prosecco and a 'Birthday' dessert plate waiting for us on arrival. The service was above and beyond right to the bar staff were we went for pre-dinner cocktails. We had a late check out added to our stay and breakfast delivered to our room the next morning. I could not recommend this hotel enough!! excellent stay and a beautiful view of St. Stephen's Green from our room. What more could you ask for!",5,2018,05,01
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel perfect for enjoying Dublin.,"Couldn't ask for a better location to enjoy Dublin's sights.  Fitzwilliam Hotel is located just across the street from St Stephen's Green and an easy walk to all the sights we wanted to visit.  From the moment we arrived the service was helpful and friendly.  We stayed two nights in room 408, large comfortable room with a view of St Stephen's Green.  We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant Glover Alley ---- what a surprised.  Usually we stay away from eating in hotel restaurants, but am so glad we ate at Glover Alley -- exceptional 3 course meal, presentation, taste and service was excellent -- definitely a 5 star meal.  Breakfast selection was good, hot items nicely prepared.  Would definitely recommend Fitzwilliam Hotel.",4,2018,04,30
204,Excellent,Very friendly helpful staff. Any questions I asked they took their time to help. Bar staff were great! Room was lovely and clean with great room service. Definitely will be back.perfect location to the attractions. ,5,2018,04,30
204,A wonderful weekend stay,"Spent a weekend in Dublin staying at the Fitzwilliam. We had a wonderful time, from the moment we arrived the wonderful staff were on hand to help us unpack luggage from the car and take it up to tje room. The concierge parked the car forums in their underground car park. The hotel bar had a great range of drinks, and the food was very nice. Breakfast in the citron was lovely, there was a nice range of hot food (eggs Florentine, royale, Benedict, waffles, pancakes, porridge, omelette, fry) which was cooked to order alongside a good range of contintenal items. Our room was lovely overlooking the green, and we we're brought a nice bottle of wine and a plate fresh fruit as we were celebrating my mum's birthday.  The hotel is in a great location with a Laus stop just outside (we never heard it from our room) Overall a brilliant stay, we'd definitely go back. ",5,2018,04,30
204,A great place to stay in Dublin,"The hotel location is in walking distance of everything you want to see in Dublin.  After a long day of travel, the beds in the room were so comfortable and we slept so well.   The shower head was phenomenal and I loved that there was a shower cap so I did not have to wash my hair. ",5,2018,04,29
204,Perfect Introduction to Ireland,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel, conveniently located on St. Stephen's Green was the perfect way to start our family vacation in Ireland. Their excellent service actually started before we even arrived. Dane, the Concierge Supervisor, gave us the name of an excellent bakery who delivered a surprise birthday cake to a local restaurant for my husband's birthday. He also provided information for church and local dining options. 

At check in we were treated to a wonderful breakfast because our room was not yet ready. Our family voted the Fitzwilliam as having the best breakfast. We particularly enjoyed the assortment of fresh pastries and the made to order egg dishes as well as the warm and welcoming staff. The was the common theme for every person that we encountered during our stay, from check-in to housekeeping we were made to feel welcome.

We had considered the Westbury, the Brooks and the Merrion. For us, the Fitzwilliam was the perfect blend, nice, but not too stuffy and not over the top boutique. The room and the accommodations were nice, but the people were even nicer. Thank  you for a brilliant stay!",5,2018,04,25
204,Best hotel in Dublin!!,Best stay in Dublin!! The Fitzwilliam delivers on quality and customer service! Will stay there again when in Dublin! My husband and I had never been to Dublin and we definitely picked one of the best hotels! ,5,2018,04,25
204,:),Location and beauty surrounds fitzwilliam hotel . Friendly staff. Ample bars and direct bus stop to airport . Loved Viking bus tour near the hotel had young & old entertained for two hours . Smallest pub 2mins from hotel . ,5,2018,04,24
204,Perfect location and great night's sleep,"We were only in Dublin for 24 hours but the Fitzwilliam ensured we made the most of that time. It's brilliantly located overlooking the main park, which is very restful, but it's also only a few steps away from the main pedestrianised shopping streets. We had a view from our room over-looking the park and yet all was quiet so we slept for nearly 9 hours - just lovely. Every single member of staff was friendly and chatty, which made us feel like valued regular clients - which we now intend to be!",5,2018,04,24
204,Will definitely come back,"Brilliant location, service, staff. Amazing breakfast, with cooked option prepared fresh on order. Staff so helpful. Rooms lovely, great shower, comfy bed, and very quiet even though so close to grafton street.",5,2018,04,24
204,"Fab location, charming staff",Really enjoyed our one night stay. There can't be a better location - right by the Green. The rooms are very nice and very clean and the staff are charming and sorted out the only minor issues we encountered. We will certainly return.,5,2018,04,24
204,Night away.,"Stayed here as I was away on business with my wife and it was my Birthday.

Have to say the hotel was only OK and I thought expensive for what it was I expected a higher standard.

Bat had a very limited selection tion and I thought it lacked atmosphere.",3,2018,04,23
204,Wonderful experience,"The staff is amazingly and consistently supportive, helpful and friendly. And the rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. Plus you cannot beat the location. One foot out the door and you are in the center of activity.",5,2018,04,23
204,Last night in Dublin.,"When I booked this hotel I wanted to stay in a nice hotel in the St Stephen's Greene area.  My last visit to Dublin 11 years ago had been to this same area and I had found it to be safe and charming.  When we arrived, we were greeted curbside and our bags were quickly taken and our car was valet parked safely in the hotels own underground parking.  Parking is 20 Euros a day but worth it.  We were shown to our room by a friendly young woman that was new to the hotel and the area.  Our bags soon followed.  Once the A/C was turned on the room temperature was as comfortable as the room itself.  Our room had a very cool stylish design. Not cold, but cool.  The bathroom had an enormous tub which unfortunately due to an early morning flight we were not able to sample.  

The Fitzwilliam knows how to add the nice little comfort touches.  In the room awaiting us were two bathrobes, two sets of slippers, a clothing press, iron and ironing board.  A knock on the door a few minutes after we settled in was our turndown bed service, complete with chocolates.  Very nice touch !  

The Fitzwilliam has a very nice bar area where we enjoyed a night cap to toast our last night in Ireland.  They offer a great selection of whiskeys, gins, vodkas, beers and wines.  Unlike other hotel bar/lounges, the Fitzwilliam's is stylish, roomy and properly lit.  You can have a drink for two in one spot while a group of friends is in another and there would be no intrusion.   ",4,2018,04,23
204,KW - weekend break,"Location was perfect, right in the centre of town. The staff were really friendly and welcoming and the room was great. Only slight criticism was that the bar area had no natural light which made it a bit gloomy. Other than that this hotel should definitely be on your list if you are visiting Dublin",5,2018,04,23
204,The very best location in Big D,"We faced the park (and traffic), absolutely quiet. We had a great room that gave us access to the roof and  a outdoor table and chairs for an evening libation. The main shopping area is a long putt away. This is a walking city and the hotel is in the center of much of the places of interest.

204,Great Hotel !,"We stayed here as part of a business trip/couples trip. From the time we checked in, we found the staff and the service to be excellent.  The lobby is bright and open/welcoming.  We had a wait after our checkout but relaxed there and were able to order tea and snacks.  Our room was spacious with a very comfortable bed.  Spotless clean.  The bathroom was a nice size with separate tub and shower so was good as we were both getting ready at the same times.  The restaurant served a very nice breakfast each morning and the coffee there was the best.  We would definitely stay here again and loved the location as we were able to walk quickly to some fun restaurants and pubs .
Definitely recommend!",5,2018,04,20
204,Fabulous hotel...great location!,"My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The staff were exceptionally kind, courteous, and very eager to please.  They always went above and beyond in everything they did.  Ivana, on the front desk, was always so friendly and kind and went out of her way to make us feel special. Kevin, was the person we saw at breakfast every morning and he always brightened our day.  He was the kindest man we've ever met and gave us so many great tips on where to go, what to see, and where to eat.  He made every guest feel important and he made our stay extra special.  It wouldn't have been the same without him.  The location was absolutely the best and was within walking distance to most of the sights in Dublin.  Our room was very spacious and very nicely decorated.  I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2018,04,19
204,Complacent and over priced,"When I arrived exhausted I asked if they knew where I could buy toothpaste. 'Don't worry, we'll bring some up'. An hour later I'd heard nothing. I rang down at midnight - now too late to go out. ""oh we can't find any"". 

And this as one of the most expensive places in town. I paid 500 euro for this. ",1,2018,04,18
204,"Location, brilliant staff brilliant....but do you want a cold shower?","Staying at the Fitswilliam for a work trip. You can't beat the location. The staff are wonderful. I have been so frustrated with the showers and the noise of the pipes at night. they've moved me to a new room and the same issue persist...the shower is unableto stay at a moderate temperature, its either scalding hot or freezing cold. 

Again staff are lovely but they need to sack their maintenance staff/supplier or just upgrade their plumbing. This cannot be considered a 5 star hotel with this still happening, at first glance its a 4/5 star hotel but reality is it is 3 star or less if you get a room where you cant shower. 

However staff amazing, location amazing...owners need to step in here to sort things out!",2,2018,04,18
204,Treated Like a Valued Friend,"After a long transatlantic flight and arriving at the front desk at 6:30 a.m., I was pleasantly surprised with an early-check in by a very sympathetic front desk. Instantly, I felt like this hotel understood travelers and how to make a hotel a home.  Stayed for 8 days and loved every minute of it.  The rooms are not large but the beds are comfortable, the housekeeping staff are superb and the bathroom was kept spotless. Housekeeping came by in the evening to leave chocolates and also freshen up the towels and bathroom as well as do a turn-down.
Lovely location across from St. Stephen's Green and easy walking access to restaurants and Grafton Street shopping.
The doormen, especially, Tony and Dane, were exceptional at making sure your every need was attended to.",5,2018,04,18
204,"great service, best location","best location in Dublin, lovely understated hotel with great staff. Rooms a bit small but apart from that everything is great at this hotel. Much better than it's busier and higher profile rivals around the Green (with the exception of the Merrion)",4,2018,04,16
204,Best shower ever,"I love the Fitzwilliam Hotel and I’ve stayed here a few times and also in Belfast. It is a really lovely and upscale hotel. The room is super nice and the bed is lovely. 
My favorite part of staying here is the great bathtub and shower. It really is my most favorite shower in the whole world. The toiletries are very nice and the towels are deluxe!",5,2018,04,13
204,Great location and staff.,"Stayed in a superior room which was smaller than expected and a little tired which is the only let down for this hotel. We had a balcony which was lovely with a great view over St Stephen’s Green. There was a slight problem with the patio heater but staff solved the problem very quickly. The breakfast was fantastic with a very good continental choice and a brilliant choice of cooked offerings. The location is great and lots of attractions, thaetre and shops just minutes away. Would highly recommend and would stay again.",4,2018,04,12
204,Wonderful Long Stay,"An excellent hotel with good services and great staff in the perfect location to enjoy all that Dublin has to offer. We stayed 12 nights and loved every minute. Dublin is a buzzy dynamic city full of great sites to see, restaurants, shops, bars and people from all over the world, and you can walk to it all from The Fitzwilliam. 

The hotel room was a good size, bright and colourful and overlooked the internal courtyard. Loved the fluffy towels. Housekeeping was excellent and responsive to our needs and the free wifi worked well.  

The staff made it - Dean, Martin and Allan (thank you all) were outstanding amongst several people helping us with restaurant bookings, hairdressers, driving instructions and anything needed. Thanks also to the breakfast team for great service, fabulous cappacinos and going above and beyond to deliver a perfect porridge ;-) 

The only niggles were the room card failing every now and then, the occasional slaming of room doors and the gym.

We would definately stay again if we have the opportunity.",5,2018,04,11
204,Amazing hotel amenities and superb staff,"Fitzwilliam hotel and staff are exceptional. They are friendly cheerful, every ready to help. They go the extra mile to make you feel special. With the added bonus of vicinity a definite recommendation for family/business stay.",5,2018,04,11
204,Excellent Hotel. Great staff.,"The Fitzwilliam has a great location being close to Grafton St and its shops, also within a short walk are the restaurants of Baggot St and adjacent streets and the National Museum and National Gallery on Merrion St. We stayed in a standard room which was large compared to most city centre hotels and had all of the amenities you would usually expect and some you wouldn't including a trouser press. The rooms were modern and very comfortable. I had read before booking, comments about the friendliness of the staff. We found all of the staff to be friendly, very helpful and highly professional which certainly enhanced our short stay. I can give the Fitzwilliam no better recommendation than to say that when we return to Dublin this will be our hotel of choice.",5,2018,04,10
204,Great location with Superb Staff,"Fantastic location in the heart of the city with excellent parking if you arrive by car. The staff are among the best in Dublin, in my experience. Nothing was a problem for them and everything was handled efficiently and in a very friendly, but professional manner. Other 5 Stars Hotels in Dublin could learn a thing or two from them.
Rooms are nice, clean and comfortable. But ours was a little noisy on Sunday morning. We had planned to have a relaxing lie in and start to Sunday, but the hotels plumbing, near our room at least, was  very noisy. It felt like we heard every toilet flush and shower on our floor. 
Perhaps other rooms and different floors are better. 
Overall a nice hotel with exceptional staff and well priced on our stay.",4,2018,04,10
204,"Charming hotel, great location for a romantic weekend","The rooms are old and the furniture clearly shows signs of wear. But it's a bit of the charm in my opinion. The staff is very nice, professional and knowledgeable. The location of the hotel is perfect for a city visit as most attractions are within walking distance. Great location for an ice cream in the park or even if you are going shopping in Grafton street. Doors in the hotel can be abit noisy as they have no ",5,2018,04,10
204,Great Hotel,"The hotel is located in an excellent location. Staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly. Food was of a high standard, and the breakfast should not be missed. A big thank you to all the staff who made out stay so memorable.",5,2018,04,09
204,Wonderful hotel with friendly helpful staff,"We had a really lovely time at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  We chose it because it was close to Grafton Street - the main shopping area, and had lots of the attractions around that we wanted to see.  Room was good and provided everything we needed, but what made it so special was the staff - they were so nice!  They really went out of their way to make our visit special.  The food was excellent too!  Would thoroughly recommend it!",5,2018,04,09
204,"Location is great, but lacking","I chose the hotel for its location in the heart of Dublin, on St Stephens Green.  I had been to Dublin before, always staying about a 15 or 20 minute walk to the city center. The location IS perfect.
The hotel is fine, but could be anywhere in the world.  It is a generic hotel like the big chains, except that I don't think it is a big chain.
Staff was helpful.
My room was small and the carpet tired though the violet/purple theme was quite unexpected and perky.  The bed was nothing special, too bad today when hotels are focusing on the basics, like excellent bedding.  No USB ports in the room to charge, so be sure to bring your plugs and adaptors.
I never saw the restaurant or any information about breakfast.  

It is a good location and a pleasant hotel",3,2018,04,09
204,Old World Quality in a Modern Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel - over the Easter holiday weekend. The Fitzwilliam is a city-centre boutique hotel. We were very happy with all aspects of our stay. In essence, the hotel succeeds in providing the type of quality which is often missing in todays mass market. It pays attention to detail. Some of the things that stand out are: the staff - there are lots of staff, and they are approachable, helpful and polite. Furthermore, they all seemed well-trained and they know there jobs. The rooms in this boutique hotel are very comfortable and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Towels, linens toiletries etc, all top quality. We had Breakfast in the hotel - cold buffet, great selection, plus hot breakfast cooked to order. This (cooked to order) rarely happens today in mass market hotels. The advantage is that this cooked breakfast was fresh. Attentive waiting staff. Quick service. The location is perfect for central Dublin. Literally just a few seconds from Grafton Street. All in all, attention to detail, well trained and helpful staff, quality rooms and food, modern contemporary décor in the middle of Central Dublin.",5,2018,04,06
204,"Terrific location, wonderful staff","Great hotel in an amazing location - love the valet parking too :)   The rooms are wonderful, and comfortable beds.  The showers are great, and the toiletries are the kind you actually want to take home.  All in all very nice.",5,2018,04,05
204,The Best Business Hotel in Dublin,I have stayed at this hotel for over ten years - at least two  stays per year.The room standard is excellent and the staff are very friendly and efficient. Location is great as you can walk to most business venues.,5,2018,04,05
204,Fantastic hotel,"Absolution loved this hotel. Great location - right in the heart of the city - but still quiet.
really nice rooms, great service - and the breakfast is really nice.
Tip: the concierges are really knowledgeable and gave us good tips of places to eat, so do ask them. 
one of my best hotel experiences for a long time (out of 60+ hotel stays/year)",5,2018,04,03
204,50th BIRTHDAY & St PATRICKS Weekend ,"Second Visit to the  Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin seeing as i was Celebrating my 50th Birthday  and it was St Patricks Weekend . The Hotel is in a Perfect location and the staff are very Friendly polite and Very Welcoming . I was disappointed with the Room it was the Queen room but it’s not the Room shown in the Photo so i tried to UP grade but I’d left it to late . The gesture of the Happy Birthday dessert was a Nice Surprise  to find in my room when i retired later that day . The Breakfast was perfect freshly cooked and to my liking definitely recommend having it . 
My  only issues i had was one the fitness room is very poor and equipment didn’t work and they need to up date it ASAP , considering this is 5 star hotel I’d expect more from the FITZWILLIAM . ",5,2018,04,03
204,"First time in Dublin, from the US","My wife and I traveled to Dublin for our first ever visit to the city, and we were flying a bit blind. Our travel agent booked us into the Fitzwilliam hotel, and we were certainly very fortunate that she did. The Fitzilliam is a marvelous hotel, with very friendly, attentive, and courteous staff who all genuinely care about making your experience the best that it can possibly be.  Every aspect of our stay was first class. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, with many attended details included.  The breakfast was also great, with very good food and outstanding service, especially for a complementary breakfast that was included in the package. The location was convenient for first-time visitors seeing many of the most interesting sites of the city and we had no problem getting around. The concierge service was especially helpful, as we had very few set plans at the beginning of our trip, but their guidance helped us to develop a great plan that allowed us to do all of the things we imagined doing in more.  In particular, Patrick Fitzgibbons, was amazingly helpful in this regard, as he helped us navigate through a number of challenges we faced outside of our stay at the hotel. He was like our old Irish friend that we have known for years, and treated us like family. On our next trip to Dublin, there is no question about where we will stay. It will be the Fitzwilliam.",5,2018,04,03
204,Happy St. Paddy's Day,"Was traveling in Ireland on business, and wanted to stay in central Dublin on St. Patrick's Day.  Knowing it would be very crowded and hectic, we wanted a nice, safe, home base in the center of the city.  This is our 2nd time staying at the Fitzwilliam and it didn't disappoint.  Central to all things in downtown Dublin, the location is perfect for visiting the city, or hiding from the mob.  Perfect for St. Pat's as we were able to venture and retreat several times when the crowds were overwhelming.  The property is fantastic, with a great restaurant and bar.  We had a balcony overlooking St. Stephen's Green.  The staff are fantastic and made every effort to make us comfortable during our stay.  A definite return destination.",5,2018,04,02
204,Hotel,Excellent hotel couldn't fault it in anyway .  We had a fabulous stay A+++++ . We stayed in September the hotel was still very busy. The  Staff were excellent an food was amazing . We had breakfast an lunch both were great. Prices were very good to. Definitely would love to return,5,2018,04,01
204,A quick visit,"I attended a workshop that was held in this hotel today. The hotel is as central as possible in Dublin, it is a lovely hotel with incredibly helpful staff. I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for a nice hotel to stay in.",4,2018,03,29
204,1 night stay,"I found the Fitzwilliam Hotel to be very welcoming, clean and friendly. Staff were polite and helpful at all times. The location of the hotel is excellent for the City Centre. We just had breakfast in the hotel and there was plenty of choice. Apart from some noise from another guest at a very inappropriate time, our stay there was most enjoyable.",4,2018,03,27
204,A Warm Welcome will be found at the FitzWilliam,A great place to stay. Perfectly situated to enjoy all that Dublin has to offer. It is opposite St Stephens Green and two minutes walk before you are in tge heart of all the bustle of people enjoying the shops & great bars and restaurants ,5,2018,03,26
204,average for its 5 star rating!,"we were checked into a room which had an extra bed and a note for another family. i phoned reception to be told we were in the correct room. the dirty dishes left all along the hallway dont give a good vibe when you are going to your room. 

the complimentary sweets were described as crisps! lol but nice all the same!

the room was ok, a bit cramped and there was money and a used ear plug on the floor beside the bed. 

on check out we had to wait a considerable amount of time for the car, when it did arrive out the front we went out, the key was then missing for another 10 minutes.

breakfast was very good, very tasty and quick....but really we didnt need two people asked us about tea/coffee and toast - they need to communicate with each other. lovely freshly squeezed orange juice and excellent mini danish pastries! 

some of the mostly very young staff were very nice and friendly. 

would definitely consider another hotel the next time - not sure the fitzwilliam is worthy of its 5 star tag!",3,2018,03,26
204,Outstanding Hotel,"At first I was having second thoughts because it was expensive (especially St. Patrick’s Day week) and was almost close to cancelling, but it all changed 2 weeks before I arrived. The hotel called me and asked if there’s anything I need help with before my arrival (advise on places to visit, etc.) they also asked if we needed a transfer from the hotel (which I was planning to hire a private car anyway).  From then to the time we arrive and from our last day, all the staff have given us the best customer service that I have never experience from any other hotel. They check with you everyday if you need any assistance and leaves you with delicious chocolates too. The staff are very friendly.  A total 5 star worth staying at. Also the location is awesome, right outside is the St. Stephens park, to the left of the hotel is Grafton St, and the Luas and bus stops right across the street!  ",5,2018,03,22
204,Staff was superb.  Beyond helpful..," I had a lovely two-night stay at the Fitzwilliam Dublin. Though the  location right across from Saint Stephen’s Green was amazing, the room was very spacious, the bed comfy and the bathroom well appointed, it was really the staff that stood out. They went the extra mile every step of the way and always made you feel nothing less than special.  And dinner in Glover’s Alley restaurant Was as inventive, delicious and sophisticated as you would find anywhere in the world.  Still dreaming about the presentation of lamb-  both traditional and modern – delish! The Fitzwilliam is the epitome of the word hospitality. A shout out to both Bronogh and the GM Fergel -  you and your team are really the best!",5,2018,03,22
204,5 star service at the Fitzwillam Hotel Dublin 3,"We arrived on March 15th for our 4 night stay at the 5 star Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin. We were on the 5th floor and the room was excellent with great faculties.
A nice sunken bath with a superb large shower head that gives you an exillerating shower.

We had breakfast included and the choices were excellent. We opted for the full Irish each morning but they catered for all dietary needs.
The staff in the Hotel were charming and efficient and you were treated to a 5 star service.

The location was perfect as It was just a few minutes from Grafton Street that then took you towards Trinity College and then O'Connell Bridge.
Across from the Hotel is St Stephen's Green and the Tram Line.
Around the corner is the Gaiety Theatre and if you turn left at the end of Grafton Street you will find O'Neill's Irish Bar with first-class food and great Irish entertainment.

We were there in Dublin for the St Patrick's Day Parade, a must see event, and the following day was the Grand Slam Rugby Match from Twickenham outside London but we found a great bar in Baggot Street called Toners where we watched Ireland create history with a 3rd Grand Slam.
Other attractions are a free walking tour of Dublin by the Yellow Umbrella Free walks starting by the Spire in O'Connell Street.

Thank you Dublin for a memorable and fantastic weekend.

204,2017 New Year's Eve Trip with 18 year old daughter,"I can't say enough positive things about this hotel, and especially the amazing staff.  Specifically, the helpful staff who helped my daughter and I have an amazing mother/daughter trip in a foreign country. BTW, we are Okies who admittedly have no sense of direction, so they were constantly helping me find places, made sure we had a safe taxi ride (otherwise, the drivers can be a little sketchy, and didn't realize they had Uber until the last day).  Great location for shopping, the deep soaking bathtubs were amazing after walking all day on cobblestone streets.   Be sure to get the deal with the daily breakfast that is included, wonderful.  They are close to all the great places to shop like Grafton St. but also close to Temple Bar and almost all places you want to visit while there which is important b/c you walk everywhere.",5,2018,03,18
204,27th-30th Oct 2017,"Lovely hotel in great location..
Fantastic breakfast which was included for ourselves.
Rooms are extremely spacious and nice.
My partner had a massage, we have been all over and she said it was one of the best she has ever had, I believe masseuse was called Ursula, would highly recommend this. 
Once again great place, if your thinking of stopping here when visiting Dublin, you should! ",5,2018,03,17
204,Disappointing,"We stayed here for a weekend in Nov. By far the best thing going for the hotel is the location, right beside Grafton St. The room was lovely, spacious and clean. The area that I feel let's down the hotel was the customer service. 
One of the evenings we went down to the bar and decided to join a few friends. My partner ordered our drinks and asked for them to be charged to our room. When the waiter came with the bill, my partner had no glasses with him and asked me to sign for it. When I looked at it there were a load of extra items on it. When I queried it with the waiter he told me that he 'assumed' that we were paying for everything.... This included the drinks and food of our 4 friends that had been sitting there for a few hours.
When we were leaving the card in the car park wouldn't work so we pressed the button for the intercom. I don't know if the person just couldn't hear us or maybe the microphone needs to be looked at but after repeatedly telling them numerous times our room number they opened the barrier. No such thing as even a 'Goodbye'.
I did email the hotel after we got home because I feel they can't fix these issues if they don't know about them but I didn't even get an acknowledgement from them.
All in all it was a pleasant stay and these issues are fairly small things but for a 5 star hotel I would have expected better customer service and attention to detail.",3,2018,03,16
204,Excellent location for Dublin city centre,"Will definitely use this hotel again.  Room lovely.  Bathroom excellent.  Breakfast was great.  Location was brilliant.  Staff were very friendly.  Located just opposite the park.  I have stayed in quite a few hotels in Dublin, and I think this is my favourite so far - probably due to location.  The hotel was quite pricey, but likely due to a weekend when the Rugby was on, but I know that hotels in Dublin are pricey anyway.  No more expensive than other hotels of similar standard.",5,2018,03,15
204,Mediocre at best.,"I was looking forward to staying here with my mother for a weekend in Dublin back in November however we were slightly disappointed by the end of the trip. Our room was pokey with furniture that was marked almost like it had been gnawed at. Felt almost a bit second hand if I'm honest. The floor and curtains were  stained as well so a fresh pair of curtains wouldn't go amiss. Just seemed cheap for a reputable and expenisve establishment. However, we found the staff to be wonderful and attentive and had plenty of information on what to do around Dublin city so they were faultless. Only thing was the bar staff could have been a little friendlier as it wasn't a busy night when we were there.",3,2018,03,14
204,A  perfect  choice,"I stayed here during a recent trip to Dublin with my sons. From the moment i arrived, I felt welcomed. The lovely staff at the from desk (Polina and the women from Venice, I’m sorry I have forgotten the name)  were very accommodating and helpful  with every interaction. 

The rooms were clean and well appointed, with comfortable beds, hot showers and the biggest  towels I have ever had in a hotel!  The tub was the typical old school European-style,  which meant I found it difficult to get in and out of, and it would be especially hard for those who have mobility issues. Our rooms ( we stayed in a total of three during our stay) were all quiet.  The bottles of water would greatly appreciated  and the plastic laundry bags were huge and made of a thick plastic. 

 We have the breakfast every morning. It  consisted of  a selection of yogurts,  cereals, pastries, fruit and charcuterie.  There was also the option to order off the hot menu, which we did one morning. My son had the Irish breakfast and I had an omelette, both were good. 

  It is often difficult to provide a high-end hotel experience without too much formality. The Fitzwilliam Is able to meld excellent service  with warmth making the guests feel comfortable at all times.  Regardless of the fine facilities, what makes this hotel stand out is the friendly, accommodating, genuinely “nice” staff and I would definitely stay here on my return trips to Dublin.",5,2018,03,11
204,Bravo,"Excellent service, very comfortable room. Well appointed and clean. The staff was simply marvelous at every turn. Professional, responsive and always pleasant. I am very critical of service so this is not easily won from me! My only wish was for a fuller fitness room, but it was very clean, supplied with nice towels, water bottles, and had new equipment.",4,2018,03,05
204,Great Hotel in centre of Dublin,"I was stranded in Dublin due to the recent Red weather alert and spent 3 nights at the Hotel, despite the many difficulties the Hotel was also experiencing with staffing and supplies the service, staff and everything was exceptional I cannot speak highly enough of this Hotel ",5,2018,03,05
204,Touch of Class,"Stayed 4 nites in Dublin at the Fitz, very clean and classy older hotel. Staff was great, helpful and informative. Excellent breakfast, something for everyone. Downtown, easy walking distance to many attractions and shops. Love to go back. ",5,2018,03,03
204,Calm in a storm,"Stayed at the very conveniently positioned Fitzwilliam , the weather was bad enough and I’d had a difficult journey- I got  a really friendly greeting ,  my room was very well laid out  , modern , spotless and well equipped , i used the business meeting rooms which were useful. What made the stay memorable was the efforts the concierge and his team went to get me a cab at 5.00 a.m. in the middle of some of the worst snowstorms in living memory - brilliant efforts and perfect customer service - somehow they trawled the streets and found me a taxi , I got to the airport on time and made it home - I would have been stranded for at least two days - great service - the hallmark of any good hotel ...... ",5,2018,03,03
204,Couldn’t be better.,"A great location and a 5 star hotel. The room was excellent, the staff exceptionally friendly, and such a great place to spend a few days in Dublin. I would thoroughly recommend it. We ordered a great cheese board to our room, and they gave it to us complimentary, unbelievable!",5,2018,03,02
204,What constitutes 5 stars,"Nothing particularly wrong with this hotel, but i would not rate it a 5 star. Location was good next to St Stephens green.Breakfast fair at 15 euro's a head & food good & plentiful. Room adequate but on the small side, bathroom needs upgrading , (shower a nightmare to get temperature of water right),usual expensive bar prices, wi fi good, staff efficient, helpful & pleasant, no negatives with them. However, I have stayed in far better 4 stars & at 200 plus euro's per night without breakfast, left me totally underwhelmed. As this was a rugby weekend , booked well in advance to get best price. Travellers will know that Dublin is bloody expensive,( glad that I don't drink Guinness in fact glad that my alcohol consumption is very little these days!!) but felt this hotel did not offer much for the money.  Free walking tours were good, kilmainham gaol museum excellent but book in advance for the tour.In fact you need to book in advance for most of the tours, Guinness, Jameson's whiskey factory etc",3,2018,02,28
204,Mrs,"Your staff were all polite and professional in their service from reception to cleaners. The hotel it self was very clean and comfortable, some of the furniture was a bit tired looking. For the price of the room I’d expected it to be better.",4,2018,02,26
204,Perfect Location ,The Fitzwilliam is beautiful but also perfectly situated in Dublin.  We were within walking distance from multiple attractions though there were times we preferred to simply stay at the hotel. The have a comfy lobby with a fire going constantly it seemed.  The bar is also comfortable though pricey. The bartenders were friendly and offered advice on the drinks. They also clearly took pride in making the drinks. Eating at Glover’s was delicious and the manager Kevin took the time to talk to us about our trip and offer his thoughts. Overall a great place to stay if in Dublin.,5,2018,02,25
204,Top Drawer Location and Service,"This was a terrific stay, mostly because of the exceptional service from every single person I encountered.  If you need something, it's as if the staff has been waiting for you to make that exact request. The location is just steps from Grafton Street, across from St. Stephens Green, and a quick walk to plenty of pubs, restaurants, and shopping.  But ultimately, it's the people who make this place so special.  Wonderful visit.",5,2018,02,24
204,Long Weekend Stay in Dublin,"Stayed for 4 nights in February. Wifi internet signal was poor/non-existant in the room. Breakfast was also poor - I tried different menu options but each was disappointing. Service is always fantastic - the staff work hard and are so accommodating. Great location. Overall, it's an expensive stay so not the best value.",3,2018,02,21
204,"For the money, I'd look elsewhere","The heating in the room was absolutely intolerable. We turned off the furnace and opened the windows, but it was still incredibly hot. The aircon didn't let you go below 19, so we managed to sweat through every night. I get that it's an old building and so heating/cooling may be a bit more difficult, but at EUR300 per night, I should be able to sleep in relative comfort. The walls are also paper thin, so hopefully you get quiet neighbors. ",2,2018,02,20
204,Location location location.,"Having stayed twice before I knew what I was getting - I booked one night here to go shopping with my daughter.  We booked a twin room with garden / interior view (which we found to be looking across at open plan offices).

We had trouble even on our 3rd visit to this hotel, finding the entrance to the hotel carpark (really poor signage), which we managed to drive past on a busy one way system.  I rang the hotel and the concierge actually ran up the street to meet me, and then got in to my car to direct me back round to the car park entrance.  Brilliant!!!!

Check in was smooth.  The room was very nice.  The complimentary bottles of water were appreciated as were the chocolates.  

We didn’t eat or drink in the hotel - we just used it as a base.  It is in an ideal location right next to the St Stephen”s Green shopping centre.  

The hotel car park charge was expensive considering the prepaid room rate was about 200 Euro for the night.  The car park cost about 30 Euro per night/day - I checked that we would not have to pay more if we stayed beyond 24 hours after check in.  This was allowed. 

The car park is tightly spaced too, for anyone with a large car it’s quite a squeeze.

204,Lovely stay,"I booked 3 rooms at this hotel for my birthday and took my family over for the trip. The hotel is the best I’ve stayed at in Dublin. It’s q7ality as soon as you step through the door. The staff are fantastic, especially the barman who introduced me to Sailor Jerry’s and ginger beer. It’s in a great location opposite St Stephens Park and at the top of Grafton Street. We had a problem with hot water in our rooms and although it was unavoidable and unfortunate the hotel remedied the situation to our satisfaction with no quibbles. That just showed it’s class.
Will definite be back. ",5,2018,02,19
204,Lovely Hotel,"Very impressed with Fitzwilliam Hotel, excellent location , very comfortable room , staff very pleasant and helpful . Stephen’s green across the road and only seconds walk from Grafton Street . Room very quiet so had a great nights sleep . I’ll be back ",5,2018,02,17
204,Very good location ,"Stayed here over the weekend for my husbands birthday! As soon as you walk into the hotel it is very grand and you feel that you are in a 5* hotel. Check in was smooth, out room was not ready but they rang us while we were out to let us know when our room was done. I arranged for chocolate covered strawberries to be in our room upon arrival but for some reason as the receptionist took us to our room a few minutes after she left another lady came to set up the strawberries which ruined the surprise a bit but the strawberries were nice and I recommend. We were later given a small fruit platter with happy birthday written on it too which was a nice gesture.
The location and staff were very good at the hotel and they do try and accommodate you! My only issue sadly :-( was I didn’t feel the room and bathroom were clean enough. There was still dust on the bath room shelf’s and the window sill and a small dead fly. Wasn’t a huge deal as we were out most of the day but just something to think about. Overall I would definitely recommend to stay here and don’t forget to try the free apples outside the lift they taste amazing. ",4,2018,02,17
204,Couldn't fault this lovely hotel!,"Wow!  Our room was gorgeous, we had Prosecco in our room courtesy of the hotel as I told them it was a surprise trip for my husband's birthday and the staff went out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.  Breakfast was superb also.",5,2018,02,15
204,ideal location,this hotel is in an ideal location for any visitor to Dublin.  The luas for Dundrum is right outside the door.  It has valet parking.  It is located at the top of Grafton Street.The bedrooms were very clean and comfortable.  A good and varied breakfast is served in the Mezzanine.,4,2018,02,12
204,A gem in the city,"We love everything about The Fitzwilliam Hotel, it truly is 5*. Everyone goes out of their way to make sure your stay is as pleasant as possible. We have now stayed a number of times and will not stay anywhere else!!",5,2018,02,12
204,Weekend Away,"Excellent service from all the staff who were very helpful and friendly. Extremely helpful concierge. Location was excellent, lovely rooms, very quiet and clean. Will definitely be back again when staying in Dublin.",5,2018,02,12
204,Wouldn’t say hotel is 5 star ,"I stayed with friends and booked three rooms. My partner and I had a suite on the sixth floor. I was very disappointed in the room. Bedroom rather small for a suite, very bad lighting, no bottle opener in mini bar, complimentary water was not replaced, no glasses in mini bar, not even a biscuit to eat with a cup of tea. We stay in lots of hotels and I have never been so disappointed with the little attention to detail in this hotel. I certainly think the suites are not worth the money and nowhere near 5 star standard. I would not rebook to stay here.",3,2018,02,11
204,Comfortable and friendly hotel,Very warm welcome by all staff. All staff happy to do the extra to make one's stay in Dublin positive. Comfortable and relaxing bedroom which was well kept. Efficient and effective services throughout the stay,5,2018,02,11
204,Classical hotel in Downtown Dublin,"Pro:
- Excellent service at reception and lobby team
- Nice room with fresh orchids in the room and even a CD player, you can borrow cd's from the lobby 
- Location: it's next to the St. Stephen's green park and less than 10 mins walk to Trinity College.

Cons:
- Service in hotel bar could be a bit faster, we had to wait to get our drinks served.",4,2018,02,11
204,Fitzwilliam hotel,Excellent location. friendly staff rooms are clean and well furnished. Good entertainment and well stocked mini bar. Restaurant bar and breakfast excellent. Easy access to all city centre activities. Value for money ,5,2018,02,08
204,The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We just stayed The Fitzwilliam for five nights and it was a great experience. The staff from front desk, to concierge's, bar & maid service was all top notch and fun. This hotel is a little more expensive but definitely worth it. Their location to park across street, restaurants, Pub's, tourist type events, bus routes, etc is all excellent. ",5,2018,02,07
204,The Best Experience,"Best experience I've had by far in any hotel I've visited. 
From start to finish we were made feel very special. 

Can't wait to go back. The staff were amazing from the minute we arrived. 
Lots of little extra special touches made it a wonderful night. ",5,2018,02,06
204,Noisy,"Staff nice and hotel clean with great central location. Stayed in room 225 on business and awake from 4.30 listening to service trolleys go up and down outside. Awful nights sleep, really disappointing stay.",2,2018,02,06
204,"Comfortable hotel, great location.","This hotel had all the comforts. The room we had was a twin single which was very comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. Great shower (essential for Australians!), comfortable beds and pillows. Staff extremely accomodating. Great location as we were able to walk to many of the main attractions. There was only one negative. When we booked the booking stated breakfast included. When we got to the breakfast room we discovered that this only included a continental breakfast (which had a good selection and was enough for myself but not my son). To order a hot breakfast it was necessary to order from a menu and this was an extra cost.",4,2018,02,05
204,Bohemian but not by Design,"So this hotel has an undeniably wonderful location which the hotelier may rely on a little too heavily...and here's why.  The little side-table by my bed was so scarred and damaged I stared at it for a while wondering if it was some kind of fashion statement; the bathroom fittings were worn and the toilet quite blackened.  On closer inspection I realized that there was soap scum in the trap in the sink!  I told the reception staff about it and asked to have the bathroom cleaned.  When I returned to my room several hours later the en suite was much cleaner.  In fact, the staff were very pleasant and responded very positively to the guests and I really did enjoy my stay.  I've read that some people found it difficult to sleep with noise but that was not my experience at all.  Perhaps the secret is to ask for a quiet room.  The car park is a plus in the city centre and while the dining room was unfortunately closed the evening that I wanted to dine there, the breakfast next morning was quite adequate. Like most city centre hotels I'd imagine the Fitz gets a lot of guest traffic which means there's good reason for it to be a little worn round the edges....still, time for a bit of an upgrade methinks.",4,2018,02,04
204,"Good Hotel, Great location","Recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam, as the Shelborne was full during a recent conference. the hotel is very clean and the staff is very professional. Rooms were very clean and well maintained. The lobby area is very bland, and not conducive to just hanging out. The hotel offered a nice breakfast. location is right by all the shopping, so the great for business and tourist alike. I would stay again.",4,2018,02,03
204,Lovely balcony overlooking St Stephen's Green,"I can not say enough good things about this hotel!  I stayed here while on a business trip in Dublin and the Fitzwilliam was wonderful.  I arrived incredibly early in the morning (6am) and they were able to check me in right away.  A kind gentleman carried my bags and brought me to my room, which was heavenly.  Gorgeous claw foot tub, very clean and large (for Europe) bathroom. The bed was comfortable and was next to the floor to ceiling windows which opened up to a balcony overlooking St Stephen's green.  I was able to sit out there and have a cup of tea and watch the sun come up over the city.  The location of the hotel is also wonderful, close to just about everything I wanted to see, and close to many restaurants and cafes.  The staff was so friendly and helpful, I wish I had been staying there longer!",5,2018,02,03
204,Perfection,"Wonderful from start to finish.  The welcome from the reception staff was exceptional.  May I mention the beauty therapist, Ursula. She gave the best treatment I have ever had, without doubt and was so lovely. Well worth a visit.  The barman also - sorry I didn't get his name, but he is welsh - gave tremendous service with a personal touch.  ",5,2018,02,02
204,Great all round hotel!,"All round a great hotel, surrounded by lovely restaurants with a decent shopping street just around the corner. St Stephens Green is opposite and a lovely place to take a morning stroll. I would definitely return.",5,2018,01,31
204,Lovely stay ,"Locations fantastic, easy to find and plenty of shops around.
Rooms are quite expensive for the size but the service is fabulous. 
The bar downstairs done lovely cocktails and served food. 
I would definitely return but would look around for the best deal. ",4,2018,01,28
204,Perfect!,"This hotel exceeded our expectations in every way! Simply perfect!!  
The staff were fab, especially the bar manager who was originally from Wales!! 
Beautiful room and bathroom.
Perfect location. 
This is a gem of a hotel and would recommend to anyone ",5,2018,01,28
204,Dublin Trip,"In Dublin for the annual aviation conference. Fitzwilliam excellent location for meetings during the week. The reasons for not getting excellent ratings are 1) poor fitness room and equipment, 2) comforter on bed is too hot, need blanket alternative and 3) tub is very high and dangerous to get into and out of with wet feet.",4,2018,01,27
204,Lunch in the bar,Was not staying at the hotel but wanted to complement the bar staff for the excellent service. All staff that I encountered were extremely polite and courteous. The bar man gave a great insight into different drinks available and places to visit to an American couple at the bar. The soup was excellent as well. ,5,2018,01,27
204,Amazing staff and facilities,We had an event this morning in one of the conference rooms which was set perfectly and there was always staff close by to help with any inquiries that we had. We went to breakfast after and Mariej done a great job taking care of use and making sure we had full cups at all times. Thank you,5,2018,01,26
204,"Great, convenient place to stay near Grafton Street","I have stayed at this hotel three times now over the past six years.  I really like it.  It's quiet and convenient to Grafton Street.  I didn't eat in any of the restaurants this time, which is probably my loss, but after being closed for 2 years, Bewley's reopened and I wanted to go back.  I don't love the gym, but it's adequate.",5,2018,01,25
204,Great stay,"Spent 2 nights here and enjoyed ourselves.  Hotel staff very friendly, helpful and efficient. Room clean and comfortable.  Excellent breakfast menu.  Complimentary newspaper is nice touch.
Luas (tram) stops just outside door of hotel and now crosses the city - so very convenient.",5,2018,01,25
204,more like a three star hotel not a five star,"we were offered a garden view at reservation stage but on arrival this did not seem to be available any more.  we were offered a room up a flight of stairs which we accepted.  it was the last room in the hotel.  I had been told my booking was non refundable,  I am sorry now I didn't just go somewhere else.  I was looking forward to a five star experience but what we got was not five star.  I don't think I would go back to this hotel. I thought if the breakfast was spectacular it would have saved the place.  however this was not to be the case.  it was mediocre.   I have been in contact with the hotel and they have offered an upgrade for my next stay.  Which is a positive but I am not sure will I be back.  I didn't experience the Citron Restaurant perhaps this may have swayed me more towards a five star experience.  ",3,2018,01,24
204,Fabulous Hotel!,"I can’t say enough about The Fitzwilliam! From the moment we arrived until we left they were amazing. Great location, can’t wait to return. Excellent location, very clean and friendly staff. We especially enjoyed the bar staff, they were fun and gave great suggestions regarding what to do. Concierge was also great and was very helpful",5,2018,01,23
204,superb location & service,"stayed here in Dec 2017 , lovely room overlooking Stephens Green , ate dinner in the restaurant and staff were outstanding, great food and reasonable considering the quality. check in and check out were seamless :-)",5,2018,01,22
204,Mahendra m,"We stayed at Fitzwilliam in Dubin for 10days and its best in Dublin as it is next to Royal college of Surgeons.excellent service and very convenient to all business establishments, banks, universities ect.",5,2018,01,21
204,Wonderful hotel,I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 weeks on business. It’s a great hotel where the staff is super friendly and really goes the extra  mile to make you feel welcome and comfortable. I’d definitely recommend staying here.  ,5,2018,01,19
204,Fab Hotel!!,"Very friendly and helpful staff, nothing was a problem, a great location, very close walking distance to shops and the great nightlife that Dublin has to offer, would definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel again!! ",5,2018,01,18
204,Amazing staff,"After an exhausting day in Dublin Ireland and my sister and I could not figure out the transportation system back to our hotel, I decided to stop at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and Dublin to ask for direction.  Dane and Marcin went the extra mile as they saw we could no longer continue our journey and provided us transportation to our hotel which is in direct competition with them.  Not only this is dedication but this is absolutely amazing to be as client oriented as these two individuals.  Thank you so much Dane and Marcin for taking care of this for us.",5,2018,01,16
204,Really impressive service!,"I can't praise this hotel and its staff enough.  I wish I had gotten the employees' names but each one we interacted with went above and beyond the standard for any hotel I've stayed at. The front desk staff, bar staff and concierges all remembered us for our entire visit. They took special care to ensure we knew the best places to eat, helped us arrange transportation and were just more pleasant than the standard hotel staff.  Our room was clean with a great view of St. Stephen's Green.  You can tell the employees are proud to work there as it is an excellent operation from the top down!!",5,2018,01,15
204,Fantastic hotel,"Unfortunately we only had 24hrs in Dublin and one night in the hotel.
We arrived at midday and an immediate checkin was no problem. The concierge could not be more helpful booking a trip and taxis. We ate in the Inn on the Green, delicious food but beware - the portions are HUGE! (Not a complaint.) Staff there were friendly and attentive and recommended some pubs. Came back to the room to find chocolates, cheese and biscuits and a gift.
The staff at the hotel are an amazing team. Could not fault our stay at all. The only thing that could have made it better was to have been able to stay longer. We will definitely be back.",5,2018,01,14
204,Pretty happy,"Great location in centre of Dublin, and walking distance to the office.  The staff are very friendly, helpful and efficient. Getting the correct temperature on the shower was a science and almost impossible the only negative.
",4,2018,01,12
204,Quality hotel,"We enjoyed our 4-day stay in this centrally located hotel.  Even though it was during the holidays, we got the best service. Clean, comfortable room.  Awesome breakfasts!  People that work there are very welcoming and helpful.
We had a view of the inner garden from our 3rd floor window which was very peaceful.  We could even see the New Year fireworks from our window.
Can't wait to stay there again!",5,2018,01,11
204,Great stay for family,"my family and I had been looking forward to our big trip to Dublin for months, and the Fitzwilliam did not disappoint! The most perfect location beside Stephens Green made for an easy walk to all of the sights we wanted to see. Great restaurants nearby (Peploe’s, Hatch & Sons). Most accommodating staff! ",4,2018,01,11
204,Great Hotel,"Loved it!  Great location, staff, rooms, service, etc.  Great Hotel!  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  They made you feel like you were not only welcomed, but appreciated.  Location is great - right off Grafton Street so access to a lot is around the corner.  ",5,2018,01,09
204,Great service and location,"The Fitzwilliam goes the extra mile with service, and there are many things I really liked about the hotel, including the service and location.  The rooms are European sized, and the two that I experienced both need to be updated.",4,2018,01,09
204,Lovely 2 night stay,"This was our second visit staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, with our previous stay being almost 15 years ago.  We arrived at the hotel early (11am) after our flight from the U.S. but as expected the room was not ready.  The concierge took our bags and the front desk told us that they would message us as soon as the room was available.  At that point we headed out to grab some lunch, but less than 15 minutes later we got notification that the room was ready.  We headed back after lunch and were quickly provided with our rooms keys and we found our bags had already been taken to the room.  The room was lovely and clean and the service at the hotel was great, with an evening turndown and the beds were comfortable.  We loved the location being at the top of Grafton Street and Temple bar is within walking distance.  Will definitely return to the Fitzwilliam and hopefully it won't take another 15 years.",4,2018,01,08
204,AMAZING,"we stayed at this hotel for the new year. The location is great and was just in the right spot for us for both the bus stop to and from the airport and the centre of town. The room was immaculate with the maids constantly making sure we had enough towels and bringing us small chocolates! We ate in the citron restaurant for New Year’s Eve and the food was amazing! The bar down stairs in the lobby area was amazing, the made great pina coladas! All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will probably book it again when we return to Dublin! ",5,2018,01,05
204,Loved it,"Our stay in this hotel was amazing. Great staff, nice service and the location is perfect. The beds are great, rooms are quiet and clean. 

The st. Stephens Green park is nice to stroll around in and the shops are right around the corner. ",5,2018,01,04
204,Great boutique hotel,"This is a great boutique hotel in an excellent location. Every member of the staff was extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. Rooms are furnished nicely and comfortable. We had our breakfast included and it was very good. The location is excellent. We walked from the hotel to St. Patrick's Cathedral, the canal, the Liffey river and the DART rail station. There are many very good restaurants within walking distance.",5,2018,01,03
204,Perfect hotel in perfect location,This is the second time I have stayed at The Fitzwilliam and it did not disappoint.  The service received from all staff is second to none and we were made to feel so welcome.  Our room was beautiful and kept spotless by the room staff.  They attended to our every need.  Food was excellent and breakfast was highly anticipated each day for the quality and choice. The Citron restaurant food was also of a very high standard.  We could not fault any aspect of the hotel and it's location id perfect for exploring the city.  I would have no hesitation in recommending it to others and I will definitely return.,5,2018,01,03
204,Not really value for money.,"Room was on the small side for what we paid and was starting to look a bit dated/tired. Staff were great. Perhaps you pay over the odds due to the good location but that still grates a bit when the room isn’t particularly anything special. Couple next to us were noisy, talking loudly and we could almost join in the conversation. ",3,2018,01,03
204,A little underwhelming for a Five Star hotel,"My family and I traveled to Dublin to celebrate New Year’s Eve. The hospitality and location are great but the rooms were a little underwhelming. We had a major issue with water temperature in the room. The first night, there was no cold water available from any of the taps. All of the taps, both hot and cold in the shower and sink, gave out boiling hot water. It made it impossible to shower and even brush your teeth without scalding yourself. Maintenance came up to look at it the first night, agreed there was a problem, and said they would investigate and call back within a few minutes. We did not receive a call until 10:00 the next morning. Fortunately, they were able to fix the problem by the next morning but it was really inconvenient and quite a turn-off for a five star, expensive hotel. While I loved the location and the friendliness of all staff, this really soured my experience.",3,2018,01,02
204,Dublin visit ,Stayed at The Fitzwilliam again for one night between Xmas & New Year great hotel couldn’t ask for better hotel we always try to stay here if the price is reasonable as it’s a class hotel staff are very attentive & rooms are clean & nothing is too much trouble for staff to make your stay comfortable great location & it has valet parking would not stay anywhere else in Dublin The Fitzwilliam is class.. keep up the good work. ,5,2018,01,02
204,Unequaled service and beauty,"The Fitzwilliam is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in my travels worldwide. I cannot speak highly enough about the warmth, friendliness, and expertise of the staff. The concierge staff is amazing and helped us find a van (mini bus) to rent at the last minute on New Year's Eve day--amazing! The staff all made everything simple and enjoyable for a family on holiday. Thank you so much; we will come again.",5,2018,01,02
204,Beautiful hotel and great staff!,In the heart of Dublin. We stayed 4 nights and I booked 2 rooms because I was with my parents. The staff provided EXCELLENT customer service!! Also the breakfast they have is lovely I highly recommend it! We will definitely go back again :),5,2018,01,02
204,"Our 4th, but not our final, visit",This was our 4th NYE stay at the Fitzwilliam and we can’t wait to return. We were pleasantly surprised with a free room upgrade after a long and horrible journey and the staff (as per) were an absolute dream. Can’t praise them enough. ,5,2018,01,02
204,Great location,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights and we very happy we could check in early after a transatlantic flight that arrived early in the morning.  The requested bed configuration wasn't available, but we were happy with the room that we ended up getting.  The best aspect of the Fitzwilliam is the location.  ",4,2018,01,01
204,Christmas in Dublin,"Returned to this hotel with my wife after spending a portion of our honeymoon there the previous year. The location is amazing, it's at the entrance of Saint Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. 
The hotel is very well run with an attention to detail from check in to check out. The staff are friendly and attentive. 
Be sure to choose a larger suite and a higher floor for a bit more room. Additionally, the rooms with a view of the park can be a bit noisy as the street below is busy.
There are some fantastic restaurants within walking distance and we chose to take advantage of those during the week that we stayed. We did eat in the restaurant a couple of times as we were in town During Christmas and the city shuts down for a few days, but I would recommend experiencing the food in the city rather than the hotel. 
In my two visits to Ireland, I've stayed at this hotel twice and will likely return for my next trip to Dublin. ",4,2018,01,01
204,Fantastic central hotel,This hotel is very well situated with fantastic friendly staff. Every evening you have a bedding service with little sweets. The bathroom products are very good. A modern but cosy room with comfortable beds.,5,2018,01,01
204,Recent XMAS  family vacation,"Bigger more complete gym needed. Better aerobic equipment and more free weights needed 

Upkeep of present gym should be better and serviced regularly. Replace water, towels and overall cleanliness. 
Thanks and happy new year. Overall great place and staff
",5,2018,01,01
204,EXCELLENT - no other word will do,"From check in, the bar and room service, concierge services and general attitude, décor and approach, this hotel is perfect.  Look no further.  They even manage to blend business, couples and family guests seamlessly; a true hotel work of art.  ",5,2017,12,30
204,Very good,Very happy with our stay in Dublin. Hotel is based in a excellent location and very handy for strolling around the main hot spots in the capital. Car parking was a bonus and not having to leave the building from the car to your room. ,4,2017,12,29
204,"Convenient Location, but not 5 star hotel","I wanted to give them 3.5 stars, but since you can't do that on Tripadvisor I gave them a ""3"". There are many pros and cons to this hotel, unfortunately there are more cons than pros, which is why they received the rating they did. 

The pros:

-Staff is friendly 
-Convenient location-right in front of St. Stephen's Green Luas stop, which now takes you into the city center. 
-Quiet hallways and rooms
-Wifi is strong throughout the whole hotel
-Family suite is great for families
-Nightly turndown service with chocolates

Cons: 
-Stand-alone shower was extremely small even for the average adult
-Fire alarm went off at 3am one night
-Breakfast is about 30 euro a person/per night (we were able to get breakfast for a family of 4 adults for about 30 euro for everyone). 
-There is no elevator to the 6th floor suites, so you have to carry your bags up the stairs
-Housekeeping turned off the lights/heater/ac everyday, which made the room too hot when we got back
-The front desk and turndown service didn't know where the temperature control was for my parents room. My parents ended up finding it when we were ready for check out. There was a remote in the desk drawer. 
-My parents reservation said they were to have a king deluxe room, but the bed was a queen. 
-The printer in the business center ran out of black ink. 
-I told the front desk, and they said thanks for letting them know. I came back the next morning and it was still out of ink. 
-Sofa bed wasn't comfortable at all.

They are trying to be a 5 star hotel, but they're not quite there. I probably wouldn't stay here again if I return to Dublin, just because of the issues listed above, and there are other 5 star hotels I could stay at.",3,2017,12,28
204,Excellent hotel in the heart of the city,"The hotel gives you easy access to all the good places to eat.  If you want to venture a little further out, you can easily hop on the train nearby.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  Wifi access is a bit slow but as long as your not streaming movies or taking video conference calls, it's bearable.  The breakfast is great.  You have the option of getting the traditional Irish breakfast or otherwise.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,12,28
204,A Fairy Tale Experience,"From the moment we arrived we knew this was going to be the Christmas to top ever other Christmas.  The reception staff were the most happy and attentive we have ever had the pleasure in dealing with. Our bags were promptly brought up to our room which was stunning, overlooking St Stephens Green.A present had been left for us and our son, that was such a sweet touch. The shower is definitely worth mentioning, It was a rainfall type with serious pressure. Pure luxury. You really would need to experience it to know what I mean. We had our Christmas dinner booked for the last sitting which was 8. Each course was sensational. Board games had been layed out in the bar and we enjoyed a few games after dinner. The breakfast the next morning was the best we have ever experienced and we would genuinely take the three hours drive to taste that again. We cannot say enough good things about this hotel, and we do not have a single negative. Everyone should experience this kind of luxury in your life.",5,2017,12,28
204,First class service,"The Fitzwilliam Dublin is a fabulously cosy, friendly hotel in a perfect location at the top of Grafton Steet right beside St Stephens Green.  The staff are amazing and go several extra miles to make guests feel welcome.  The atmosphere is warm, the food is gorgeous but it's the positive upbeat attitude of staff that is the most endearing element of the Fitzwilliam experience.  Kay",5,2017,12,28
204,Christmas 2017 at The Fitzwilliam,"My family and I had a very enjoyable stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel again this Christmas, it really is a magical time and we are looking forward to repeating this experience again next Christmas at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2017,12,27
204,fantastic christmas stay,myself and my husband stayed christmas eve and christmas day it exceeded all our expectations fantastic food fantastic service all the staff are brilliant will definately going to fitzwilliam dublin again thank you,5,2017,12,27
204,Creme de la creme of Dublin hotels ,"Where do I start? 

Walking through the grand doors into the amazing reception area being greeted by some of the most professional concierge I’ve ever come across! 

Having our bags taken to the room ready for us, being asked about our plans and having lots of recommendations shown to us and pointed out to us.

The rooms are simply beautiful, well presented & super clean.

We never ate here for dinner because we had other recommendations given to us BUT breakfast? WOW! The eggs Benedict we had made for us were second to NON! 

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone friend, family etc

So worth the money!",5,2017,12,26
204,Not a 5 star hotel,"I will highlight the pros and cons of this hotel. The pros are that is is very convenient to everything. The Luas station is just right out the hotel door. The staff is also very friendly as well. The cons are that the rooms are weird. My parents had a hard time finding their air conditioning unit and when they asked the front desk, they told them the wrong place to look. My brother and I had a suite on the 6th floor and there are no elevators up the 6th floor. You have to ride the elevator up to the 5th and then walk up stairs to get to the 6th floor. The shower was really weird in our suite because it was very  hard to try and get the water at the perfect temperature. Our room keys also stopped working several times during our stay. The fire alarm also went off at 3:00 am and when we called the front desk to ask about it, they did not even apologize for the incident. Breakfast is also not included and is very expensive so that is another down side.  We were supposed to have 2 rooms with king size beds and when we checked in they told us the beds were the same size in both rooms. Well they weren't, my parents bed was a queen and my bed was a king. It's not a five star hotel. ",4,2017,12,25
204,Christmas In Dublin,"The Fitzwilliam is in a great location on St Stephen’s Green. The staff are outstanding and couldn’t be more helpful.

Unfortunately the room was a little tired and could do with upgrading. 

The overall experience was very Good, especially with the hotel being so busy 
",3,2017,12,24
204,Recent stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay in Fitzwilliam the location was perfect, the view from our room on the 4th floor was lovely to see St Stephens Green, the food was excellent as was the staff we are coming back Christmas eve for dinner with extended family looking forward to that.",4,2017,12,23
204,Lovely setting,"Located at the end of St. Stephens Green in Dublin is the Fitzwilliam Hotel which is a 5 star boutique hotel, the main hotel ground floor is basically the lobby with a lounge bar off it, the rooms are well fitted out with the 2 top floors looking onto St. Stephens green having a balcony, the breakfast is first class far better than Brooks Hotel, the best part of staying here is its location next door to the main shopping area of Grafton Street.",4,2017,12,22
204,Amazing Hotel,Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Excellent location with car park. Breakfast was one of the best I’ve ever had and the display was amazing. Thank you to all at the Fitzwilliam for making our stay so comfortable. ,5,2017,12,22
204,Irish hospitality at its best,"My sister and I were attending a family wedding and needed one nights accommodation in Dublin to help us shake of the jet lag and refresh ourselves for the big day. The fitzwilliam was just the place to do this.  Customer service is top notch from the extremely accommodating front desk to the waitstaff at the restaurant.  Nothing was too much to ask and everyone had a smile while doing it.  Patrick, the head concierge, arranged for our driver the morning of the wedding.  He even called while we were en route to make sure we would be at the wedding on time.  My sister is already planning a return trip with her family and the fitzwilliam is the only hotel she will consider.",5,2017,12,21
204,Luxurious comfort in a perfect location,"My three night stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel could not have been more comfortable or relaxing.  From the welcome amenity to the excellent location, everything I needed was taken care of.  I highly recommend this lovely, welcoming hotel to anyone in need of accommodations in Dublin.",5,2017,12,20
204,One night stay in Dublin,"Great location, staff very polite, friendly and professional, rooms spotlessly clean with all the facilities one could need - very difficult to find fault with the staff or service so keep up the good work! I will definitely stay there again !",5,2017,12,20
204,Excellent," Great location and a very attentive concierge. Rooms are really nice, very clean and really well laid out. Power shower was amazing and breakfast was excellent. Overall a really great experience and would definitely stay again. ",5,2017,12,19
204,Definitely stay here!,"Had an excellent experience at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin. The hotel room was very clean and well decorated. Bathrobes, slippers, turndown service. The whole stay felt very luxurious. The hotel is centrally located and the staff were all very friendly. Highly recommend. If/when I return to Dublin, I most definitely will return to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Many thanks for a great stay! ",5,2017,12,19
204,"Great Service, Design a bit old fashioned ","I stayed for three nights and had an overall very good experience. Good service, a nice but unusual looking room with furniture that did not look brand new either. Despite the fact that there was no walk in shower it was an ok experience. Breakfast is good and also for people from the continent, not only British style.",4,2017,12,19
204,Staff are better than the location!,"We had an excellent experience during our stay. The location for Christmas shopping is obviously great but one could not be prepared for the friendliness of the warm staff.

We had a minor issue with losing an earring down the bathroom drain and the staff were so helpful arranging for its retrieval. Getting the earring was a bonus but far surpassed by how obliging the staff were.

I would definitely recommend. We normally stay in the westbury hotel for Christmas but the staff of the Fitzwilliam May swing it for us going forward.",5,2017,12,19
204,A great hotel in a very nice location,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a business trip to Dublin. It's in a great location, right on St Stephen's Green, and I had a very enjoyable stay. My room was basically right at the end of quite a windy corridor, but staff were in the main helpful and polite.

I didn't really get to check out all of the facilities here, but it was clean, tidy and well staffed. I'd probably go back if I'm in town again",4,2017,12,18
204,Very Good," Hotel was excellent warm and clean, will definitely say again. Breakfast was fast and tasty with no rush put on us.  Bar staff were excellent showing excellent knowledge of gin (my drink) the bar was very comfortable but in the evening I did experience it was quite cold and I needed to wear my jacket. ",5,2017,12,18
204,Great City Centre location,"Great stay and perfect location for easy reach of a large selection of bars and restaurants and of course the shops. Beautiful rooms and no noise from the Luas tram line from the bedrooms. I would rate this stay as very good, we will be back",4,2017,12,18
204,Great Hotel,A great stay right in the city centre. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The only downsides were we found the room too hot during the night and some of the other guests did wake me in the middle of the night drunkenly walking past our room. But the hotel can't control that! We would stay here again.,5,2017,12,18
204,Great hotel in very way,"My daughters and I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam.  From the moment we walked in  from our pre-dawn flight from the US, we were greeted by a warm, welcoming staff, ready to do whatever it took to make our stay perfect.  The concierge service was incredible, the front desk staff caring, and the bar and restaurant staff excellent.  The breakfast is beyond compare, try to the Eggs Benedict, the best I've ever had.  We had planned to try a different hotel on the last weekend of our  trip, but after two nights at this hotel, I canceled and booked here again.  It was just that good a hotel.  The location is perfect.  The St. Stephen's park across the street is a pleasant place to sit and people watch.   Everything is just about perfect here.  The Christmas decorations were just beautiful.   If I am lucky enough to get back to Dublin (who wouldn't want to go back to Ireland), I will always stay at the Fitzwilliam, truly a home away from home.",5,2017,12,17
204,a place to be,We went to Dublin in November for a short visit and the Fitz was such a nice host to us. The room large and very clean - thanks very much to the friendly housekeeping. The breakfast absolut fab and the staff was so friendly - a very big thanks to Maciej - people like you make a stay at the Fitz very special!!!,5,2017,12,14
204,Wonderful exerience!,"We loved the Fitzwilliam. The location is fantastic and close to everything. We had a very early arrival (5:00 a.m. arrival from US) and although our planned room wasn't available yet, the desk clerk found us another room and let us crash there so we could get some sleep before our regular room was open. Such a nice gesture and we were so grateful as we'd had no sleep on the flight the night before. The staff was beyond compare - so kind and helpful. We loved it and will return again.",5,2017,12,13
204,"Nice hotel, great location, very friendly service!","The hotel staff was extremely polite and friendly. All staff members provided excellent, warm and professional service. Our room was neat and spacious enough, but not very special, yet luxurious. If we wouldn't have expect the same five star standard as in other cities we have visited, we would have been happy about the room. Now we thought the room was not quite what we expected considering the quite high price. Also when arriving to the hotel, there was a little smell of mould in the room and in the corridor. The location of the hotel was great, near everything. The breakfast was very good with a lot of options to choose. It was not even expensive. All in all, the hotel was a nice one and I can recommend it, if you don't expect it to be a luxurious five star hotel.    ",4,2017,12,13
204,Exceptional service experience,Stayed here for one night after our departing flight was delayed and wished we had stayed here for more entire stay in Dublin. The staff delivered exceptional service from the moment we arrived until we left.,5,2017,12,12
204,Exceiient,"My husband and I stayed in your hotel as a present from our children .we had a wonderful night ,enjoyed our meal ,in the restaurant .The dining room was comfortable but lacking in atmosphere .Our friends also have stayed in your Hotel and advised us not to dine with you for the same reason However we had a lovely breakfast excellent service and friendly efficient staff .",5,2017,12,12
204,"Great location, room and overall stay!","The Fitzwilliam is an excellent choice for a stay in Dublin.  Hotel has a great location to many attractions.  Walking distance to Dublin Castle, Trinity College, Temple Bar and Grafton Street which has tons of shops and pubs.
Rooms were decent sized, clean, and had  extremely comfortable beds.  
hotel has a very small fitness center---bike, treadmill, elliptical and some free weights--just what you need for a quick workout before a day of sightseeing and adventures.
Staff was friendly and helpful.  Would absolutely recommend and return for a 2nd visit!",4,2017,12,12
204,Friends trip,"Would highly recommend, staff were amazing, they could not do enough. Location is fantastic, everything within walking distance.  Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice.  Foyer is very welcoming and warm.",5,2017,12,12

Fantactic location and clean bright rooms.",5,2017,12,11
204,"Great Experience, amazing customer service","I had an amazing experience, the hotel location is great near Grafton street. The breakfast was excellent a combination of continental and English breakfast.
The customer service was second to none this is the next level.
The room as decent, clean and comfy, however I found it a bit small compared to other hotels with the same rating.
I will definitely stay in the hotel for my next visit to Dublin.",5,2017,12,11
204,Good stay,"Good hotel, great breakfast and great location. Some minor issues with room service and minor repairs that are needed in the room, incl. soundproof (there is none). Staff were very nice, especially Majcek at breakfast and Mirna at check-out. Thank you!",4,2017,12,10
204,"Wonderful Staff. Clean, comfortable rooms.","The rooms are clean and very comfortable. It would be nice if they included a bureau with drawers of some sort, but there is nevertheless enough room to store your clothing outside of your suitcase. The staff is wonderful. If you need something they are there for you. The breakfast offerings were very good. My only knock on the hotel is that the ""gym"" is a small airless room with about three pieces of equipment. The location right off of Stephen's Green puts you near most of the major sights within Dublin. In terms of value I would rate the Fitzwilliam Hotel ahead of the Shelbourne Hotel. I have stayed at both and in the future will likely end up booking the Fitzwilliam.",5,2017,12,09
204,Lewis is a legend!,"In the cocktail bar in the hotel and we have had a wonderful evening. Lewis aka 'The Legend Mixologist' has just provided us with a fabulous evening of cocktails. 11/10 Lewis, the service, friendliness and fun in here is second to none!

204,Best staff ever,"The staff are the best we have ever encountered at a hotel. The rooms are spacious and the location is perfect. The food is of the highest quality, and the service is second to none. This is the place to stay when in Dublin",5,2017,12,07
204,Loved it!!,Great location. VERY friendly staff. Great bar!! They even packed us a small breakfast to take with us for our day tour. I know the Irish are friendly but this place tops it off. Would come back again. Lots of wonderful restaurants within walking distance.,5,2017,12,06
204,"Location, Location, Location","A very well appointed hotel close to shopping, pubs and attractions.   The hotel was very accommodating with a need to change rooms due to accessibility.  This hotel is walking distance to a great shopping area and has a tram stop right out the door.  I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone.",5,2017,12,05
204,Two day stay for family event.,"We stayed for for our daughter's graduation from university. The staff's helpfulness in accommodating our request for an early check in was excellent. All the staff were very cheerful and attentive which created a relaxing ambiance. The room was very comfortable and the bedding materials, particularly the pillows, were excellent. The hotel location is unbeatable for a city centre stay in Dublin. This was our first stay at The Fitzwilliam but we intend to return. ",5,2017,12,04
204,Excellent hotel,Stayed as part of our Late Late Show competition prize. It was just fabulous.  Would definitely stay here again. Every minute was so enjoyable. Friendly and professional staff and very comfortable room. ,5,2017,12,04
204,Brilliant Hotel in central Dublin,"We stayed for 2 nights at the weekend, and I honestly couldn't fault this hotel. Everything about it was excellent from the friendly staff at the reception desk to the always smiling doormen. Our room was large and comfortable and overlooked St Stephen's Green, and was surprisingly quiet for a city centre hotel. Breakfast was good, and although we didn't eat in the restaurant, we did in the bar and found the food enjoyable and the service good. You must try their gins, they are something else! I would recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone who wants a quiet hotel in a central location.",5,2017,12,04
204,Thank you to all the staff...,"... who have made out stay comfortable and memorable. Our room was kept in tidy and impeccable condition throughout the day by meticulous staff.  The concierge was very helpful with recommendations and reservations. Great location and quiet rooms, could not ask for more. Thank you!",5,2017,12,03
204,"Snazzy, modern downtown hotel wins with chipper service","The rooms at the Fitzwilliam are modern and well designed. The location at the top of Grafton Street and across from St. Stephens Green is excellent. The breakfast is well appointed.  But what really surprised us was when the restaurant host greeted us on our last day with a departing handshake, a sincere thank you for staying, and request that we please come back.  That type of personal touch makes all the difference when travelling abroad.",4,2017,12,01
204,Nice Hotel in a Great City!,"I thought the concierge workers were overall very helpful. There was one concierge who completely ignored me as I stood at the desk attempting to book a cab, which I have never experienced at a 5 star hotel. 
The room overall was very clean; however, I did find a few bits of debris on the bathroom floor one day after getting back to the room. The room was drafty and cold the first two nights as well, but eventually it warmed up. The front desk staff were very friendly, particularly a young lady from Romania (I can't remember her name). 
The food in the bar was a little below par. I did receive a bowl of roasted vegetables that included some of the hottest peppers I have ever tasted and eggplant that was still partially raw. I was offered  complimentary espresso by the staff for delivering my chips late to the table, which was a nice gesture. Additionally, room service had very fast delivery, which I appreciated. On one occasion I asked for two small bottles of still water and I received two large bottles, one still, one sparkling. 
Overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam and I plan to stay again! The location cannot be beat and the staff and amenities were overall very good!",4,2017,11,29
204,Great location,I wanted a hotel with a good location and this is for sure it. It’s a nice but not really modern hotel. Rooms are not big and are fine. The service provided is good and friendly. I think price is in the higher end all taken into consideration. Location will probably take me back,3,2017,11,28
204,Perfect spot for stay in Dublin,"My sisters, aunt and I went to Dublin for 5 days trip. We wanted somewhere that was close to Grafton street/ Temple Bar area and that we could keep a rental car at and take day trips from. 

The fitzwilliam is perfectly located on st stephen’s green... steps away from the top of Grafton Street.  The staff is tremendous, the breakfast that is included with rare is excellent and the comfort of the hotel rooms and beds is incomparable.

There are air of business folks that stay here so the hotel is nice and quiet at night, except for that bar if you are looking for some fun.  
The rate is higher than some of other hotel deals you will find BUT it is worth every penny more that you spend . ",5,2017,11,28
204,Great hotel in best location,"Stayed here for work and a bit of vacation before, and it was the best location to the City Center. Breakfast was great (and included) every morning so the upper cost helped out with that. Would definitely recommend. ",5,2017,11,27
204,Best place to stay in Dublin,"The best customer service we have ever experienced at a hotel! Friendly, helpful, genuine and high quality are words to describe it. The location was perfect for our trip! We were able to walk to so many sites, restaurants, bus stops, day trip pick-up spots, etc... We enjoyed coming back to our rooms each day as the housekeeping service always had our rooms so clean, organized, and comfortable. The staff knows how to make their guests feel right at home!",5,2017,11,25
204,Honeymoon,"This hotel was beautiful and the staff was amazing! The location is right near a large park, shopping center, and was walking distance to The Guinness Storehouse, Christchurch Cathedral, and Dublin Castle among other attractions. Highly recommended! ",5,2017,11,25

204,Staff are the stars,"Had a Fantastic time, the staff were exceptional and kept making our stay better and better with each contact. It was an anniversary stay and they made us feel so special. The restaurant may not be mitchelin star anymore but it was still great.",5,2017,11,20
204,Perfect weekend,"Thank you for your excellent service, food and accommodation. The room and the hotel in general was very charming and perfectly located in the heart of the city. The breakfast was beyond expectations!",5,2017,11,20
204,Bathroom issues,"Excellent reception staff. The room was disappointing small. The bathroom was the main issue - the bath didn't drain correctly, the shower handle leaked, grout was black around around taps, toilet took ages to fill up - you had to wait ages to flush it a second time, extractor fan very poor - the bathroom became a steam room very quick, large tile behind toilet loose and finally a dripping tap if you didn't close it tight. Usually go to the Davenport, was there weekend 10/11 Nov, but decided to give the Fitzwilliam a chance - paid a lot more for a much inferior room. It was a special 50th birthday occasion so I am really disappointed to be honest. ",2,2017,11,20
204,City Centre Break,"Travelled with wife for a night in Dublin. Location was fantastic, service really excellent. We had afternoon tea and really enjoyed that experience.
Rooms were perfectly comfortable and functional while not extraordinary.
Breakfast was really first class - very hard to fault it.
Overall would recommend the hotel and well done on the service levels in all areas.",4,2017,11,20
204,Best Staff and service in Dublin,"We spent 1 night in the hotel. From the time we arrived until we left, the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had the most relaxing stay possible. The rooms are perfectly appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay. We've stayed in several 5star hotels in Ireland and can honestly say the staff in the fitzwilliam are easily the best we've had the pleasure of meeting. 
Will definitely stay there again and recommend it to everyone looking for luxury in the heart of the city. ",5,2017,11,19
204,Great Hotel and Location,"I enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam.  Clean, friendly staff, modern atmosphere.  The location was perfect for shopping, enjoying the local night life, and accessing tours etc.  The only frustration for me was that my room key de-magnetized a few times which required me to have to get help to enter my room.  This is likely due to my cell phone but nevertheless an inconvenience.",5,2017,11,19
204,A great central location,"A great place to stay for accessing the historical, shopping and cultural areas of the city.
Our room was compact but clean with all necessary amenities. Any issues we had were addressed promptly. Breakfast experience was a little haphazard.

204,Excellent Stay,Had a great stay while in Dublin with friends. All staff were genuinely friendly. The conceirge staff were v helpful and recommended great restaurants. Rooms are Fab. Perfect  location on Stephens green. ,5,2017,11,18

204,Dublin Birthday Trip,"Fantastic Hotel.... its perfect for a Dublin experience. The parking was convenient although was not specific to the Hotel.... Hmmm?? so if I'd not got a slot when I arrived Hmmm??? However is a fantastic place to stay, perfect for us and the celebrations. Really close to great restaurants and Bars etc.",5,2017,11,15
204,Wonderful Stay!,"My fiancé at the time and I stayed from November 5th to the 12th —- during the week we got married in Dublin!

The hotel was fantastic and the accommodations were great. The location was perfect for us and the daily Irish breakfast was convenient. 

Because we were getting married on the 10th, our room had a fruit and chocolate platter ready in our room. So nice and thoughtful. 

Located right next door to Stephen’s Greene shopping center and across from a light rail for convenient traveling, although there was a rail strike during our stay, we opted to use the taxis instead. 

Everyone in Ireland and including our hotel staff were so nice and helpful. 

When we come back to Dublin, and believe me—- we will come back, we’ll definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam again. 

Thank you!

Bradley and Midori",5,2017,11,14
204,Magical stay in Dublin at Fitzwiliam!,"The Inn staff were warm and friendly. Front desk staff very helpful and assisting.  Food was good with decent variety.  Room was kept clean and tidy.  Overall, a very pleasant experience at Fitzwilliam, which made our trip to Dublin more special!",5,2017,11,14
204,Something a bit different....,"I originally booked to stay two nights in the nearby Shelbourne Hotel for my honeymoon and spent one night there. After the awful customer service there though I cancelled the second night and booked in at the Fitzwilliam and what a treat. I wish I had booked both nights here. The customer service was excellent from the moment I drove my car up and they couldn’t do enough for us. 

They really pay attention to detail here and while the rooms may not be quite as good as the Shelbourne they are still amazing and a bit more contemporary. 

They also made a nice touch of a decorated fruit and chocolate platter for us newly weds. 

Our room was overlooking St Stephens Green and had a outside balcony with table and chairs. 

Styling may not be to everyone’s taste but I quite liked it. And it was certainly better value for money than The Shelbourne. ",4,2017,11,13
204,Best service levels,"Title says it all, best service levels we have ever encountered, nothing was ever any trouble. Had afternoon tea, the homemade Ferror Rocher sweets were excellent. Great location for sightseeing, most things are withing walking distance.",5,2017,11,13
204,City Centre Stay,"The location, facilities and staff of this Hotel are excellent, however I was very disappointed with the room we had for two nights.  The room was very small and stuffy and and the furniture was shabby with scratches, water marks and scald marks and there were stains on the carpet and curtains.  The bed was very comfortable though and the pillows were perfect. We were unable to open the door fully when the luggage rack was open!  Bathroom was good and spotlessly clean.",4,2017,11,13
204,Nice stay,We had a pleasant stay in this hotel. The location is superb. Not sure if it deserves the 5* rating though. We enjoyed lovely cocktails in the bar. The rooms were comfy but a little on the small side.,3,2017,11,13
204,Nice hotel.  Just missing something ,The staff were friendly. The location was great.  The rooms are a bit small.  I also don’t like the 6th floor rooms since you have to take an elevator to the fifth and then Climb up a flight of stairs. The hotel just misses something that will make it a 5 star,4,2017,11,12
204,"Great location, great service, quiet","Not the first time I have stayed here on a mixture of business and pleasure. The reason I use this hotel mainly is its location, which is on St Stephens Green so close to the best shopping, restaurants and tram system. The staff have always been good and this time was no different. On arrival my room AC was not working so I made reception aware. They sorted it, moved my stuff and gave me a better room whilst I went about my business.

The rooms are also very comfy and quiet which is important when you seek a good nights sleep. They have a modern style to them and have most of the features you expect in a good hotel room. This a great mid-high standard hotel in a great location with good service and GREAT breakfasts!!",4,2017,11,11

204,"Great staff, great location, lovely hotel!","I loved staying at the Fitzwilliam.  The hotel has a more cozy feel to it, more trendy and sophisticated.  Staff is soooo helpful and friendly. Nice and quiet for restful night's sleep.   Location can't be beat, right on St. Stephen's green, directly adjacent to Grafton St shopping, easy walk to Trinity College, Temple bar, museums.  I only wish I'd had more time to explore, was there only one night.  I'd definitely return there.",5,2017,11,10

204,Excellent experience,Love the central location and the friendliness of your staffs. Very helpful especially one of the staffs managed to find us a portable heater when we feedback that the room was very cold to us. Thanks!,5,2017,11,10
204,Stay here!!!!,"So, having been to Europe before (not to Ireland) but having read other reviews of this hotel, my wife and I were expecting a lot - and they delivered!  Having arrived after an over night flight, I emailed to hotel manager in advance to inquire about an early check-in, and they gladly accommodated that request.  Everyone from those at the front desk to the cleaning staff to those at the bar were over the top in terms of their efforts to make sure that you were happy.  Rooms were great (we had room overlooking the street/St. Stephens that for some could be considered noisy); location couldn't be better; and I just don't have anything negative to say at all!  Will definitely be back!",5,2017,11,09
204,Dublin Hotel,"Close to anything you may want to do in Dublin.  Everything within walking distance and taxis are easily accessible if needed.  Door men were helpful with luggage, information and getting taxis.  Hotel staff were very friendly",5,2017,11,08
204,"Ok, but rooms too noisy","I'm on the second night of a two night stay. This is the second night I am not able to sleep. The noise above and next to me is just horrendous. I would class it half acceptable in a travelodge but given this is a ""5* hotel"" is quite shocking. 
Avoid room 228 at all costs. You are ground floor facing the courtyard. No privacy at all. The cleaning cupboard is to your right and if you're unlucky and have active guests above you you'll hear their every move. It's now 1am and it hasn't quietened down. I have called reception on both nights and whilst they said they would investigate I have had no call back, and the noise just continues. Very disappointing. ",3,2017,11,08
204,Another lovely visit to our favourite Dublin Hotel.,"Booked a family room and a double for a Saturday night last month. From start to finish our stay an absolute pleasure.We were checked in by Lisa who througout our stay was amazingly attentive. She made us feel that we were the most important guests in the Hotel. The rooms as always were spotless with very comfortable beds.
Breakfast on Sunday morning served until 12.00 was exceptional with an amazing range on offer. Next overnight stay or short break in Dublin will of course be in The Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2017,11,08
204,A memorable experience!,It's nice to be able to say that you can find such a lovely hotel within walking distance of Grafton Street at reasonable rates .....  Very handy if you want to take in a trip to the Theatre and soak up some of the atmosphere of the city! ,5,2017,11,08
204,Happy birthday stay,"Looking forward to a return visit to a lovely hotel. Situation is ideal for shopping, socialising, and sightseeing. Very safe area.breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Restaurant dinner was very good. We were all happy.
  ",5,2017,11,07
204,Best Service anywhere in the world in my opinion,"Everything was just perfect! the room, the service, the food.....no faults whatsoever. I loved it here. :-) The breakfast was so fresh and delicious. The service in all areas was second to none.. Cannot wait to return :-)",5,2017,11,07
204,Outstanding Customer Service!,"By far the BEST customer service I have received from ANY hotel!
The kind of service you always expect and hope for. 
Every time we entered the main lobby we were greeted with an open door. The reservationists, the concierge, managers, everyone was top notch and went above and beyond with their politeness, kindness and hospitality. 
We arrived at 5 AM in Dublin. We were able to store our luggage there as well as get a day room to freshen up until our room was ready.
The manager who checked us in actually personally took us up to our room and gave an explanation of all of the amenities offered.
When visiting Dublin we will definitely return!",5,2017,11,06
204,City centre stay.,"We were very impressed with the staff from the first contact to check out. Every detail is considered by the staff to ensure we had an excellent stay. 
We stayed on the 5th floor with balcony overlooking St Stephens green. The bath is large for a city centre hotel and the rain shower would give neck muscles a workout. 
This hotel is streets ahead of its famous rival and I look forward to staying here again. ",5,2017,11,06
204,Great place to stay,"The room was surprisingly spacious, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was very good, with the option of Continental or hot food options.  Everything about the stay was just right. ",5,2017,11,06
204,"Nice hotel, excellent service","Really nice hotel in a central area.  Easy to walk to most downtown locations.  The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and they offer turn down service.  Excellent breakfast included with the price. ",5,2017,11,05
204,"Great location, Great hotel","I had a terrific 4 night stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The location is fantastic, right near the action, but a bit away, so it is not so hectic.  My room overlooked St. Stephen's green and had a nice view of the city.  The staff was friendly and helpful and my room was clean and spacious.  I'd like to thank the concierge team for all of the help they provided throughout my stay from arranging transportation to giving expert directions and recommendations.  Highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,11,04
204,Poor breakfast,"Room was very nice, hot breakfast for both of us very unpleasant, staff were very friendly. The hotel mentions parking but not the fact that it costs €20 per night. Expensive no value for money would not recommend it.",3,2017,11,02
204,Best location overlooking St. Stephen's Green,"We very much enjoyed our one night at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.   It's convenient to the best shopping and pubs, and just across the street overlooking St. Stephen's Green.   Staff was very friendly, making it a most enjoyable experience.",5,2017,11,02
204,Small room,"Nice hotel but not worth the price, in my opinion. Room was very small with barely any room for moving around (and we weren't in the cheapest room category either). Little things that you expect to be done in a 5-star hotel weren't done (e.g. housekeeping didn't move the iron from the desk back to its place when they serviced the room). No replacement of complementary water in the room after the one that was in the room when we arrived. I will say the staff were great and the concierge desk was very helpful. Just expected more for the price.",3,2017,10,31
204,Pleasure ,"First time at a 5 Star hotel in Ireland, so I was expecting some luxury. Alas I got hassle! Checking in. Wanted 250 euros as a room deposit on a credit card. Understandable but steep. When asked will this be returned reception told me 3-4 days. Obviously not impressed they get my money and interest for almost a week. Well I prefer to pay cash so I don’t have a credit card. Unable to release my room without a credit card deposit or a full nights room charge. Had to pay 300 euros upfront in cash.
Room wasn’t ready so I asked them to call me when it was. This did not happen!
Staff friendly enough, food nice. Ambience average.
Would I recommend it... tbh I’ve stayed at better 3 star hotels.",2,2017,10,31
204,Best cocktails in Dublin!,"Enjoyed a really great evening at the luxurious yet timeless bar at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. 

The staff were very attentive and Tomas in particular is really great company and an excellent bar supervisor! You just have to come to see him in action, laugh at his silly jokes and taste the cocktails that he recommended and expertly mixed :)
Keep up the great work. 
Merv",5,2017,10,30
204,Ok experience.,The hotel was lovely n staff and all very nice but the room  was bit small n the bed for the price we paid I have stayed in bigger rooms for less the bed could have been a lot bigger and I am glad we didn’t have our 2 year old son with us he wouldn’t have been able to move it definitely wasn’t value for money,5,2017,10,30
204,Highly recommend,Excellent hotel great location and super staff. So quiet yet right in the heart of the city. Spotless rooms and the large bathroom with stand alone bath  make this a luxurious stay. Could not fault the hotel.,5,2017,10,29
204,business mtg,"good services, good location close to all city center amenities, excellent breakfast services and choice, small room, unacceptable gym (tiny, broken equipment), very gentle and professional reception attitude ",4,2017,10,29
204,A pleased client,A lovely property with very helpful staff..  The location is excellent.  There are a number of very good restaurants nearby and the Green is always a lovely place for a walk.  I regularly stay at the Fitzwilliam and look forward to doing so again soon.,4,2017,10,27
204,Perfection,"Service at it's finest, from the front desk check in, room cleanliness, full breakfast and most of all the wonderful concierge service.  Travis and another concierge with blue eyes and the nicest smile were so helpful.  The hotel itself is lovely and right by the famous Grafton Street, Molly Malone statue and the peaceful St. Stephens Green.  It's also within walking distance to the location pickup for many of the tours.  Taxi's are always available as well as the buses. We would definitely chose this hotel again.",5,2017,10,26
204,Great location,"As a regular visitor to Dublin for business this is my 'go to' hotel in Dublin. With friendly staff and some fantastic rooms with views over St Stephen's Green, it is ideally situated for both work and play. 
One small downside is the hotel is getting slightly tired around the edges but the overall experience makes you overlook this small detail.",4,2017,10,26
204,Birthday treat,A treat for my 40th birthday and did not disappoint. An amazing hotel in a fabulous location and the hotel bar is pretty good too!!! We were advised to try some of the side streets off of Grafton Street and were not disappointed! Great atmosphere and authenticity. ,5,2017,10,24
204,dublin 2017,"beautiful hotel/room, great location, priced for that.  my only issues were that the front desk staff at about 10pm had no idea how to help me get to my Airlink bus the next morning, and I had to struggle to find my way to the right spot in the rain.  I think this should be basic information that the front desk should have, accurately, about where to catch the bus (the stop is not far from the hotel but the online info from Airlink is quite confusing).",4,2017,10,23
204,One night stay,"My room was super and quite even though overlooking the busy St Stephen's Green.  My colleagues rooms were a little on the small side and the twin room beds were quite close together, but as it's a city centre hotel not unusual.  ",4,2017,10,23
204,Amazing birthday weekend trip away,"On a wet and wild weekend, we arrived at the Fitzwilliam hotel to a warm welcome, the reception staff were very friendly, readily offering hints about where the best cocktails could be had and suggesting fabulous restaurants to suit our taste.  Our room was fabulous and very trendy, with a wonderfully comfy bed and a superbly powerful shower in a beautiful bathroom. No complaints whatsoever, nothing was too much trouble and we will certainly be back! The location wa spot on - close to Grafton street to pick up whatever we needed and a short walk to Temple bar, but was also very quiet considering we were in the heart of everything - we ere very sad to be heading home, but our taxi driver was happy to regale us with soccer stories and let slip that apparently Beyoncé stays at the Fitzwilliam - can't be bad! Try it, you won't be sorry! S & G",5,2017,10,22
204,Very nice,"Very nice Hotel in Dublin, with good service, and especially I'd like to apprreciate an extraordinary, helpful and very friendly staff. Good location in city center, very nice, cosy room. I definitely recomend this place with a pleasure :) ",5,2017,10,21
204,1 night stay,"We did only stay one night so was not able to get the full feel of the hotel.  If you have any sort of handicap issues, you should let them know.  Some rooms only have very tall tubs.  The service was definitely top notch.",5,2017,10,21
204,"Peaceful Courtyard Room, very pleasant staff & smallllll Gymmmm","If you want to work out this is not the hotel you want, but for the rest, really nice environment, in the middle of town, quite space rooms (for Irish standards that is), and very polite and friendly staff!!",5,2017,10,20
204,Great Place to Stay in the BEST Location in Dublin,"Nice and moderately swanky hotel in the heart of Dublin with super people making sure everything is well taken care of! The bar is gorgeous and the Guinness is cold! Whats more, if you need something taken care of just ask and they will address it.",4,2017,10,19
204,Location and Service,"Checked in early this mornings after an overnight flight from Canada, checking in around 09:00.  Reception was first rate and although our room was not immediately available, we were offered a great hot/cold breakfast and baggage storage.  This permitted us time to clean up, eat, and wonder the area and gain some bearings.  Upon our return around lunch the room was ready.  This is a modern and new facility- rooms are spacious yet efficient, very clean, beds comfortable and street noise well controlled.  Staff were helpful and efficient.  Pricing is high but competitive in this location.",5,2017,10,18
204,Favorite Dublin hotel,"I've been coming to Dublin for 17 years and the Fitzwilliams is my favorite hotel to stay at, great location, perfect size wonderful staff. Rooms are understated but very nice, breakfast is excellent and fast.",5,2017,10,16
204,Excellent Stay in Dublin,"This hotel exceeded our expectations, which were high to begin with given what we saw from the website.  I've been to Dublin dozens of times, but this hotel was by far the best accommodations I've had in the city.",5,2017,10,16
204,Great d I wn town location.,"Great hotel, the staff was over the top w helpfulness. Patrick at the front desk went above and beyond to help us with plans for the three days we where there. There are so many pubs and restaurants within a short walk.",5,2017,10,15
204,A very special experience in an amazing hotel,"As experienced 5-star travelers we would highly recommend the FitzWilliam.  The rooms are very comfortable and luxurious, the service is impeccable and the location is perfect.  We would also recommend that you ask the concierge for dining recommendations because we had the best dining experiences through his wise suggestions. ",5,2017,10,15
204,"Location,Location Location","Just where you want to be for a trip to Dublin.  Walk to everything.  Not everything is great, (pretty low marks for the breakfast, and the bar lacks any kind of character) but  who cares.  Concierge service was pretty special.  ",4,2017,10,15
204,Staff were the highlight of our trip,"We stayed on two occasions on our trip.  The entire staff was amazing.  However, Josefina was the one who stole our hearts.  Her outgoing enthusiastic personality made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped inside.  She even left a cute fruit plate and note to help us celebrate my husbands birthday.  The bus staff were very gracious and efficient.  The rooms were were great with a big tub and a separate entry way.  They thought of everything, including an umbrella in the room.  

Great location to all the tourist locations in Dublin, as well as, shopping as it is right next to a shopping mall.  

Wonderful breakfast!  Hot made to order eggs and bacon.  Even a fresh honeycomb!  Loved it!

Loved this hotel and would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2017,10,14
204,Great location and professional staff,"St Stephens Green is a lovely location. Close to the main shopping area. The green is lovely and a running a few laps for your daily exercise is very picturesque. 

Rooms were well appointed and spacious. Nightly turn down service was lovely. So we're the chocolates. 

The first impression with the well healed doorman is great. Reception staff were friendly & professional. Restaurant & bar staff well trained & friendly. 
Most comfortable beds I had for my 4 stops around Europe.  Breakfast room on the mezzanine was a bit manic & loud but the eggs benedict was well cooked with runny yolks. 

Great hotel - I will be back.

204,An enjoyable stay at The Fitzwilliam,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwiliam Hotel Dublin. It was our first visit to Dublin, and the staff could not have been more helpful and knowledgeable.We were upgraded to a larger room which was very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious with lots of choices. The location is perfect for walking to the many historical sites and also good restaurants.",5,2017,10,11
204,Wonderful Place to Stay!!!,This is a lovely hotel in a great location!  Walking distance to so many things.  The concierge staff is amazingly attentive to every detail you could possibly need... even down to a special birthday surprise at a nearby restaurant!  Would go back in a heartbeat!,5,2017,10,11
204,The Very Best Place to Stay in Dublin!!!,"We were just in Dublin for the 4th time. We LOVE the Fitzwilliam. They totally go out of their way to make you have a wonderful stay from check-in to check-out. It was our 2nd stay there. The manager, the check in staff, the dining room wait staff, the doormen, the bartenders; EVERYBODY was awesome. Our room was great. This time we even had a little balcony; it was too cool to be out there. We can't wait to return!",5,2017,10,11
204,Fantastic Stay,We landed in Dublin at 6:30AM and were totally off kilter with jet lag. Words cannot describe our appreciation and delight to find our beautiful room overlooking St. Stephen's Green ready when we arrived at 8AM! The staff was warm and wonderful filled with suggestions for dining and touring. Everything about the hotel was beyond first class and the Fitzwilliam would be my first choice for a future visit to Dublin.,5,2017,10,09
204,Beautiful place to stay and great location,We stayed for three nights and had a great time. View from our balcony over the park along with a wonderful staff made this a wonderful experience. It has individual air and heat control in the room which was nice too. Beautiful bathroom!,5,2017,10,09
204,Super Location,This is the place to stay for having a good night in Dublin and a good days shopping if you have the time. Great location. Friendly staff and helpful  Good service Breakfast really good  Nice rooms did not spend too much time in them,4,2017,10,06
204,First class stay,"I stayed in the hotel during a business trip, the room was fantastic, staff and service equally so. I will use this hotel for work again (and again!). A highlight was the breakfast, which was cooked to order and a multitude of choices.",5,2017,10,06
204,Superb service,We were treated so well at the Fitzwilliam we would definitely go back there next time in Dublin. Great central location. Great breakfast buffet. Staff could not have been more helpful. A personalized welcome card invited us for complementary cocktails at the bar. When we returned after dinner there was a gift bag for us and another invitation for a whiskey tasting. Just wonderful!,5,2017,10,05
204,Great property and amazing staff,"The hotel is right in a very walkable part of Dublin.  The quality of the hotel was excellent.  Class A all the way.  You have to be willing to pay for it, but the value is there if you want convenience and a luxury experience.",5,2017,10,04
204,Fabulous Fitzwilliam,"The property, people, food, beverages, accommodations and location were nothing short of stellar.  Well located for restaurants, sight seeing, shopping and enjoying the area. Shopping right nearby and had everything that my bring interest to you. Local sights Guinness and Jameson tours, other local historical walks across the way at St. Stephens Green.  Many options for transport. ",5,2017,10,04
204,Excellent location and service,"Excellent location and service at the hotel. Had a standard room for 6 nights on a business trip. Each room comes with an umbrella to help you prepare for the weather of the city - which I thought was lovely!! Located in the heart of the city, and everything from Temple Bar to Trinity was 5-10 mind walk away. Breakfast was a little hit and miss - but there are some wonderful cafes around too. ",5,2017,10,04
204,Quick visit,"First impressions of the Fitzwilliam is the friendliness of the staff who understand the meaning of hospitality which sets it apart from the generic impersonal attitude of most city hotels. The foyer is light and airy with loads of informal seating in front of a burning fire and with plenty of staff to assist. Check in is quick and efficient with plenty of information to make your stay easy and comfortable. Plenty of information on entering your room, from places of interest to recommendations of places to eat and drink. The room was spotless and the bed extremely comfortable. My only very slight criticism would be that the bathroom needs a bit of tlc and updating. Breakfast was fabulous with a huge selection to suit all tastes and the quality of produce was first class. From the concierge to the bar staff and desk staff, everyone is happy and extremely helpfull and make a huge effort. Loved the little touches of chocolates left on the bed each day and the departing gift, all very simple but make a huge difference to the overall experience. Will definitely be staying here again on our next visit.",4,2017,10,04
204,Good mid-town hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is centrally-located for the tourist or first-time visitor.  It is well-appointed, clean and staffed with friendly Dubliners.  We were able to walk to all the major attractions in central Dublin.  We  enjoyed our stay here.",5,2017,10,02
204,Excellent hotel in Dublin!,"Kind and very helpful staff, cosy and comfortable room, very good bed with excellent pillows. Enjoyable breakfast with good    coffee and kind service. The hotel has excellent location. It is really a great place to stay!",5,2017,10,02
204,Top rate all the way,Stayed here one night prior to our departure from Ireland. Hotel is very nice and the staff are great. Hotel has a vibe of the Renaissance hotels before they became weird. Would definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2017,09,30
204,Beautiful Hotel Great Location,"The Fitzwilliam is a lovely hotel situated in the perfect spot in Dublin ! The decor

is modern,the size is of the room is average. The reception area and hotel staff 

are friendly and knowledgeable about places to see and eat. When you leave

the front entrance you can see the life of the city. Lots and coming and goings and 

whether you turn left or right you will arrive at either a place to shop or a sight to

see.

The only negative comment I can make is the height of the bath tub ! Because I

am of short stature I had some difficulty exiting after a shower. The only grab bar

is next to the shower head. One would be better located nearer to the towel rack.

 The girl at the front desk told me they were renovating some of the rooms. The

one we stayed in was fairly new but could definitely use an additional bar.  JH",5,2017,09,30
204,Knowledgeable and Friendly Staff,"Our stay was fantastic! The staff was very knowledgeable about our tourist questions and overly friendly! Really made you feel at home and welcome! They even when the extra mile to provide us with an adorable fruit plate that said Happy Honeymoon! 
Five Stars on the board! ",5,2017,09,28
204,A botique hotel that is not coherent,"If you are a ""clean room nice service and I am happy"" kind of traveler, then this would be a great hotel with a wonderful location. The issue is that there doesn't seem to be a coherent style, character, or theme with this place. It is not relaxing, it is not business, it is not family, and it certainly is not chic. It has a theme color, but other than that everything seem to be done at different time by different people.",3,2017,09,27
204,"Hotel, Dublin","We stayed here at the end of August for one night. I booked this hotel after seeing the location and reading reviews. I also saw a promotion through The Luxury Collection, service which I booked, which included free breakfast, 30 euro credit, and a welcome amenity. 

We had come to Dublin to spend a night with family after visiting other relatives elsewhere in Ireland. We arrived late afternoon and the front desk gave our toddler a pirate themed pack which was well received. We met with a family member in the lobby and, after discussing with the concierge found nearby restaurant recommendation. Staff, were professional and helpful. 

The room was fine. I wouldn’t call it luxury in any shape or form. Allegedly, we should have received a welcome amenity at our room – they did come in to do a room turndown and left a couple of pieces of chocolate on the bed and made up the sofa bed for our kid. We had one bottle of still water left in the room for us and didn’t receive any others. The welcome amenity never surfaced, or was mentioned by staff again. I was not offered any compensation for the missing items.

We returned to the hotel that evening (my birthday) as we had our toddler with us, knowing we couldn’t really go anywhere else. We went to the bar for a couple of drinks before bed. We sat in the pretty much empty lounge. There were maybe 2 to 3 tables occupied when we arrived. We were ignored. My wife had to go to the bar and get the attention of a bar staff member and asked for a wine list – he barked at her that it was on the table. She then had to go to ask for them to take our order. Throughout he was sullen and curt. We determined we would finish one drink and leave rather than spend any more time in a space we were clearly unwelcome in. We had some left over french fries from dinner which we gave to our toddler for a snack – suddenly the same bar staff appeared, taking great interest in us finally, admonishing us for breaking hotel policy and telling me I was in breach of health and safety regulations. This astonishing act of customer service seemed out of place considering the price of establishment we were staying at.
For note, the bar wine list is very underwhelming in this day and age. Maybe they have a better selection in their restaurant. 

The following morning took turns going to breakfast. The food was good, I had the full Irish. The service was decidedly substandard. The restaurant was 50% occupied and staff were slow and sullen. We swapped and my wife went for her turn and found the same. Very disappointing considering the large difference in quality between the food and the service. 

At this point our plans had changed and we were staying additional night in Dublin due to canceled plans elsewhere. We decided not to rebook for a second night here (mostly due to the unpleasant experience at the bar the night previous) and found a room at another, nearby hotel. I checked out and the staff member at the front desk was very professional and went out of their way to tag and take care of our luggage, and give me an umbrella. 

We returned to pick up our stuff a few hours later. The concierge desk was unoccupied so my wife approached the front desk and a different staff member than the one I had checked out with earlier told my wife to go to the concierge desk. They made no effort to actually help. The front desk staff didn’t have any other customers requiring assistance at this point. Eventually another member of staff came along in the lobby area and got our bags for us. My wife approached the front desk again and asked for a comment card, saying she wasn’t happy at the service on a few occasions. She was told to “go on Trip Advisor” (and here we are!). 

Just before we left, a staff member came over and said he had overheard us talking and asked if there was anything he could help us with. I gave him a rundown of the above. He did tell me that the bar staff was correct for challenging me (about outside food) and beyond vague platitudes didn’t seem that engaged with taking our complaints seriously. He asked if there was anything else he could do to help (as we were literally walking out the door) and I said it was a bit late for that. 

Overall, a very expensive and frustrating experience. The hotel is in an amazing location, at the top of Grafton Street, and across from St Stephens Green. The hotel is pleasant and clean, though workmanlike and a little dull. They charge luxury rates and deliver functional and mid-tier amenities. The service is at one extreme or the other – we were assisted by several competent, pleasant, and professional staff during our stay. We also encountered several sullen, unprofessional and difficult staff also.  I find it bizarre that an establishment with international clientele can have such inconsistent delivery.",2,2017,09,26
204,"Great Stay, Attentive Staff, Nice Room","We stayed here on two different occasions in September, and were so glad we selected the Fitzwilliam.  The location is perfect, and the staff attentive and professional.  We departed on a very early flight, and the front desk representative had coffee waiting for us!  How thoughtful and much appreciated by us!!

We enjoyed the Garden View room we had on our second stay somewhat more that the room facing Stephen's green.  The Garden View was somewhat larger, and the window seat made the room feel more open.  All rooms were very clean and well-appointed.  We would definitely stay here again!  

Breakfast buffet is offered, but we just prefer coffee or teas.",5,2017,09,26
204,"Great location, friendly and helpful staff.","This hotel was recommended by a travel agent and she was right, the location is great, the hotel is clean and upscale, and the staff was very accomodating. We were close to central Dublin, shopping, dining, and transportation.",5,2017,09,26
204,Excellent service at The Fitzwilliam,"amazing service at the Fitzwilliam.  
Great location too.  Only drawback of a room overlooking St Stephen's Green is that it was noisy - especially with the partiers coming back very late in the evening (early in the morning, really)",4,2017,09,25
204,Dublin City break,Good hotel in a great location. Staff were very helpful and attentive. Would stay there again as it's very central. Concierge staff were extremely knowledgable and helpful sorting out reservations and parking. ,5,2017,09,25
204,"Cleaners knocking on door from 8am, TERRIBLE breakfast","Shoddy breakfast, way below par for a 5 star hotel. Messy dining room, limited choice, not cooked to a high standard. You get what you pay for, unless you stay in the Fitzwilliam by the looks of it.

Cleaners knocking at the door from 8am, knocked again at 9am and 11am with them walking in twice. A complete invasion of a guest privacy and it should not happen under any circumstance.",2,2017,09,24
204,Perfect Central Location,"We spent four nights at the Fitzwilliam and were very happy with our stay.  The concierge was very helpful, and the cleaning staff did an excellent job!  Everyone we encountered was super friendly and helpful.  The rooms are not oversized, but they are very comfortable and contain a great deal of storage.  We loved that the train stop was across the street and that everything you need while traveling was within a short walking distance.....great restaurants, pubs, shopping, and sight seeing.  The only downside is that the gym is so tiny...they do offer a 10 euro per day use fee at a nearby gym, but it is not nice at all.  I went to Yoga Hub....a five minute walk instead.  Overall....very happy with this hotel!",5,2017,09,22
204,Ideal Dublin Location,"Located across the street from St. Stephen's park close to Grafton street this hotel is an ideal location for exploring Dublin.  As requested we were given a quite room in the back of the hotel so we could catch up on sleep after long flight from US.  Our room was more than adequate and a very good value for our two night stay before starting out on a 10 day trip to see the Irish countryside.  The staff was always, attentive, friendly and helpful during our stay.  Highly recommend the Fitzwilliam for your stay in Dublin.",5,2017,09,22
204,Amazing Staff and an amazing Hotel!,Wonderful staff! Made our first time in Ireland so special. Excellent advice on where to go and what to do around Dublin. Very nice staff and extremely helpful with any questions we had. Thank you!!!!,5,2017,09,20
204,Above our expectations,The service was wonderful the entire time we were there. The concierge had wonderful suggestions for places to go to eat and the rest of the staff was helpful and accommodating. The room we got was great with a great view over the park.,5,2017,09,20
204,Ireland & Scotland visit,"A perfect location for walking to all of Dublin. Very  clean, comfortable, spacious room & bath. The courtyard view is totally quiet and perfect for sleeping well.
Outstanding staff, delicious breakfast.",5,2017,09,20
204,Couples break away,My husband and I stayed over night we passed this hotel many times and liked the look of it so we treated our selfs to a night here could not fault thou hotel in any way from the reception staff to bar staff every one was so nice we stayed in a court yard room it was spotless and very cosy would stay here again. And recommend  to any one ,5,2017,09,20
204,Superb staff and customer service..,"Our stay was booked via Authentic Ireland and after reading reviews would not have selected this hotel of my own accord.
We were in room 508 which had a balcony and wonderful view over the park...you had to be very agile to get in and out through the window to get onto the balcony.,the room itself was very small with a very large bathroom that was in need of refurbishment with tiles that were discoloured and needing replacing and fittings that were well passed their sell by date...again you needed to be very agile to get in and out of the very high sided bath/shower.
The bed was like a slab of rock and the very pleasant reception staff requested an extra duvet cover to go on top of the matress which helped the sleep quality of the bed
However the saddest part and the reason why my rating is so low is that we had 3 sleepness nights at the hotel due to noisy/drunk/over zealous nocturnal habits of our neighbouring guests...it was like being in a Travel lodge or Premier inn....many of these noisy guests were visiting golfers who we can only assume had ladies of the night visiting them into the early hours of the morning.
The hotel is situated next to a TGFI and the smell of dirty oil and deep fat fried food wafted up to our room both in the evening and the morning.We walked in and walked out of the hotel bar as it was not welcoming and looked very grubby and also in need of refurbishment.
I am sorry I cannot be more positive with regards our room and surroundings.
On a big positive....
The Staff are superb and in particular the wait staff at breakfast were like a breath of fresh air....
The concierge also was fabulous and was able to make an advance booking for me in our next hotel in Killarney.
We would not return to the hotel and certainly found the cost we were charged for the room to be in excess of its value....there are certainly more high end hotels in the city and not a million miles away from this location.",3,2017,09,20
204,Luxury Hotel in good location!,"Loved the room, good size, very clean an the addition of cafetiere and coffee was a great bonus. Pillows very impressive for a hotel nice and fluffy, not too soft, i slept like a baby!! We received a warm friendly welcome upon and arrival and Concierge was very helpful with recommendations. Bar area is nice and is the standard prices for drinks, again service from staff was great. Location is central, located near the bus station making connections from airport easy.",5,2017,09,20
204,Great place ,"Really lovely hotel. Good food, comfortable rooms and friendly staff, who were more than helpful. There was a great  choice of food and all meals reasonably priced for s capital city.Would like to stay here again if business allows me !",5,2017,09,20
204,Lovely stay,Beautiful well located hotel. Our room was lovely facing the park. Breakfast was delicious with anything you could want.  The staff could not do enough to make our stay perfect.  My husband and I would stay here again.,5,2017,09,19
204,Very pleasant stay,"Stayed for 3 nights. Room is reasonably spacious and pretty clean. Friendly and helpful staff.  Breakfast was good as well.  Location is very good, right in the heart of the City. All sightseeings are in walkable distance. Certainly good quality hotel at reasonable price.",5,2017,09,19
204,Fitzwillian Hotel stay,"We rate the Fitzwilliam Hotel as EXCELLENT. All staff members were committed to ensure our stay in Dublin was enjoyable. Any assistance we required was pleasantly, efficiently and effectively provided. We cannot single out any particular staff person as all were exceedingly accommodating.  If you are going to Dublin do yourself a favour and book the Fitzwilliam Hotel, you will be glad you did.",5,2017,09,17
204,Fabulous Fitzwilliams,"Our flight from the United States arrived at the crack of dawn in Dublin and the Fitzwilliams Hotel was ready with a bright and airy room for us. Tony the wonderfully cheerful and helpful concierge greeted us at curbside and made our three night stay in Dublin most enjoyable. The darkening curtains allowed us to take a few hours nap before setting out to explore the city from a central location across from the beautiful park of St. Stephen's Green. The Fitzwilliams provides you with maps and/or downloadable podcasts for various sights in town. It's close to the shopping district of Grafton Street, amazing restaurants Trinity College, national museums, and the rowdy Temple Bar near the River Liffey. Tony and the concierge team arranged for our bus trip to the Wicklow Mountains, Powerscourt and the Gledalough Monastery.  They arranged for dinner reservations for the following week at hard to get into restaurants at the Delahunt and Matt the Thresher.  Whether it was a request for extra towels, a corkscrew or driving directions, the Fitzwilliams happily obliged.  The Continental breakfast and hot dishes were hearty, tasty and sustaining for the day. Dinner choices were broad and delicious. Restaurant and bar staff were attentive and efficient, as was Housekeeping. We wished we had booked our last two nights upon our return to Dublin at the Fitzwilliams.  Our room had a large king size bed, excellent lighting with windows that opened for fresh air and roomy closets and drawers. The bathroom was spacious with a spa shower and deep soaking tub.  It's a wonderful, modern luxury hotel in the heart of the city with a top notch team.",5,2017,09,17
204,Definitely not a 5 star hotel,"This is not a 5 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.  I'm not even sure if it's a 4 star hotel.  There were numerous problems during my stay, many of which were rectified, some of which were not.  Taken all together though, it was an unpleasant experience.  The room was also fairly basic.  This hotel holds itself out as a luxury property, which it is not.  If you are accustomed to staying at luxury hotels, you probably won't enjoy staying here.",2,2017,09,17
204,"Average stay, overpriced","The rates they are charging are very much out of line with the quality of the property and service.  Not a bad place, just average.  There were mix ups with various pick up and drop off times with laundry service, and my room was above renovation constructions ongoing at the hotel (badly needed - hopefully they are updating rooms).",3,2017,09,16
204,Best in Dublin,"wonderful room, great staff and absolutely the best location !! cant recommend enough. Everything is close to the hotel the concierge service is fantastic. Close to shopping and the famous paradise like garden right opposite, pop in for a walk and you will be in heaven surrounded with beauty !! ",4,2017,09,13
204,"the location is marvellous, but not worth the money","our room was small and dark and to be honest nothing astonishing. The only advantage the hotel has is the location. I found the mini bar 15 second charging rule very disappointing. Completely understand why the hotel would have to do it, but for me, i want to stay somewhere that feels more welcoming.",3,2017,09,12
204,Service is 5-Star.....,"We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 4 nights in a deluxe room overlooking St. Stephen's Green.

The best parts about this hotel are it's 5 star staff and location.  Every single staff member we came into contact with was absolutely helpful and welcoming.  When we had a few glitches, they were looked into and compensated for immediately.  Special thanks to Ross at concierge for booking us tickets to local attractions and great restaurants-your help was much appreciated.  The location is perfect-right next to Grafton street for shopping, close to fine dining on Pembroke, and a nice (sobering) walk back from Temple Bar/Fleet St area.  

We did have a few issues-mostly related to oversight and quality of the facilities. 

Our first night there, a screw fell out of the shower handle right into the shower drain-hot water running.  My partner called downstairs and within minutes we had a maintenance technician there to solve the problem-he was very apologetic and handled the issue professionally and immediately-making sure we opened the windows so as not to set off the fire alarm.  We also noticed that the handles on the sink were need of some maintenance as well.  As other travelers have noted, while the water pressure/shower itself is lovely, getting into and out of the shower is a bit challenging-if you have hip pain or any kind of mobility issue, this may be a problem for you.  The room itself was quite small compared to other rooms in Ireland that we have paid the same price for, but the bed was spot on comfortable.

Our major issue was noise.  We expected some street noise, but it was the thinness of the walls that bothered us.  We could hear with crystal clear quality every other patron, maid/turn down service member that walked through the hallways, even speaking in a normal decibel.  We happened to be right next to the linen closet, which we will avoid in the future (it is a heavy traffic area).  We did pass some other hotel guests who told us that they were moving to a different room (reading TA it seems this happens occasionally)-we assume it was for this reason, but who knows?

But perhaps our biggest glitch was a simple oversight/mistake by the staff, but we do understand that these things happen.  We came back from a lovely dinner around 10pm to our room-the door was closed most of the way but unlatched-completely open to anyone who happened to walk by.  We frantically searched everything to make sure that nothing had been stolen (we had been shopping that day..and thankfully nothing had) and immediately called reception to let them know.  They were very apologetic and within minutes we had a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar (unfortunately we did not use them).   We assume that turn down service failed to make sure the door closed all the way behind them, but all the same, we were a bit unnerved.

As a hotel described as a ""5-star hotel"" in Dublin city center, we thought that it fell just a bit short of that, especially at the price point.  We would stay here again in Dublin, but we will probably look to other hotels first.",4,2017,09,12
204,Recent visit,"Hotel location excellent... rooms tiny, uncomfortable sitting chairs. Staff excellent. Would not stay again due to small room size, price simply not worth the prime location. And I'm a multi-millionaire who travels internationally regularly.",3,2017,09,12
204,One of the friendliest hotels I have stayed,"I stayed at this hotel for my business trip.
As I arrived at the hotel, staff members welcomed me with a friendly smile, which warmed my heart; this really gave me an impression that the stay is going to be great- which it certainly was.
The room was perfect, comfy bed, with sophisticated interior. Box of chocolate on the bed every evening gave me happiness after a day of work. Situated in front of the Luas stop, the location was great, I also enjoyed the walk around St. Stephens Green, and shopping on Grafton street where there are different types of shops.
It was a little bit difficult to adjust the temperature of the shower but apart from that, I enjoyed my long stay, and would definitely want to come back again.",5,2017,09,11
204,Excellent hotel,"This hotel was outstanding. The staff are so lovely and helped with any questions we had. 

The location was fantastic, walking distance to all restaurants,bars, temple bar, Guinness factory. 

I have never experienced a breakfast like it. The choice for breakfast was amazing, lots of healthy options and lots of cooked options. 

We also had dinner at this hotel one evening and it was wonderful, so tasty and lots of it. 

The room was beautiful, bed really comfy and specious bathroom. 

Would recommend this hotel for couples travelling to Dublin who want a hotel that offers a bit extra. It is beautiful. ",5,2017,09,08
204,Absolutely wonderful,Loved this hotel. My trip to Ireland was just wonderful as i knew I had made the right decision on where to stay which I consider so important in the whole experience of my travels. Loved Ireland and Dublin. Thank you so much to all the staff at this excellent and friendly hotel in such a perfect location. If you choose to stay here you have definstely made the correct decision. ,5,2017,09,07
204,Perfect stay in Dublin,"I think we finally found our favorite hotel in Dublin. The room was lovely and well appointed from the furnishings to the fresh orchids. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. The location was an added plus with so many restaurants, shops and important sites within walking distance of the hotel. ",5,2017,09,06
204,Delicious,The food was certainly worth the money at this fine place. The starter of choice for me was pate and the main was fish. The delicacy of the prep really hit to convey the chef's visionary aim. This should be applauded. My family loved the wine too. Definitely one to aim for when looking at gastronomie.,4,2017,09,06
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel,The hotel staff were friendly and knowledgeable! Especially the conceige. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻Location was great - at grafton street and within walkable distance to most places of interest. Will stay again on my next trip to dublin. 😊,5,2017,09,05
204,Great Location and Staff,"I visited last week for a few child free days with my husband.  The room itself looked fab and a great view of St Stephen's Green.  Staff were very friendly and helpful though a few small niggles made this less than a 5* hotel for me.  The bed whilst it looked lovely was the most uncomfortable I have slept on i think as it was rock hard! As I was only there 2 nights I didn't complain but it was a shame as it definitely took the edge off my break away.  I'd recommend anyone to go have a massage with Ursula in the salon as she is excellent and a lovely lady to chat to also.  Breakfast was a vast selection but some of the cooked items were a bit bland which again I thought would have been avoidable in a 5* hotel.  Best location in Dublin I would say and you are obviously paying a premium for that.  We stayed at the Merrion last time and I felt it was definitely a cut above the Fitzwilliam in terms of the beds, food and upkeep of the premises.",4,2017,09,05
204,Superb staff,"Lovely oasis, beautifully convenient. There were a few disappointments that the staff compensated for immediately. The breakfast bar offered both made to order and a lovely variety of other choices, as sweet rolls and croissants.   ",4,2017,09,04
204,"Lovely spot, centrally located.","Worked out well. Nice rooms and staff were friendly.  We arrived from the US on an overnight flight so we were there before check in time. While the room wasn't ready, they did provide us with a complimentary breakfast and made it very comfortable for us.",4,2017,09,04
204,Last minute stay in Dublin,"My wife and I recently had some travel issues making a connection at the Dublin airport and needed to book an overnight stay. It was a Saturday and we knew finding a vacancy in the city would be difficult, but the Fitzwilliam staff was understanding and able to accommodate us. I can't say enough about the friendliness of the hotel staff; it certainly went a long way towards making the most of an unplanned visit. I would consider staying at the Fitzwilliam again in future.",4,2017,09,04
204,Good surprise...,"Entrance area too stark - concierge desk messy -
Bar area not warm
Description in Preferred brochure out of date ?
Dublin map not good - far too mich publicity...
Small faults in an otherwise great property",4,2017,09,04
204,Poor service at reception,"I had in general a good stay at the hotel. It is a great city center location. There is however one thing which went wrong. The hotel was unable to provide me at check-out an invoice with my company name on it. I asked when I checked in, Provide the details, the stappeld my business card with details on the checkin form. And the the problem started. I asked for the invoice the evening befor I left, I asked for the invoice the morning I left and subsequently I had to call once and e-mail three times to get the riht invoice. This takes too much time for a busy travelar, so I will not go ther again.",1,2017,09,02
204,First Class,"Superb hotel. Staff so friendly. Every one we were in contact with were pleasant and helpful.  Location is excellent close to everything , Breakfast first class and great selection to suit everyone .  Highly recommended ",5,2017,09,02
204,Superb,"First visit to the Fitzwilliam Dublin and hopefully not our last!  From beginning to end the experience was exceptional.  Everyone we came in contact with were smiling and genuine.  There was real warmth in their interaction with all the guests.

It was a Birthday celebration and we were given complementary breakfast , which was amazing, such a selection to choose from, and lovely chocolates were sent to the room.

The room was in a very quiet corridor and had everything we could possibly need. The turn down service was a lovely touch.  My only slight issue is with the height of the bath I had difficulty accessing the shower due to back problems ,and it was a bit awkward but other than that everything else was perfect.

The Location is unrivalled. Close to everything you would want to see or go to. We walked everywhere .

Thank you to all the staff who helped make our stay such a positive one.",5,2017,09,01
204,Enjoyed our stay,"Friendly staff, beautiful rooms, clean. I would say alone this hotel offers wonderful customer service, helpful nothing would be to much more over reception staff on check in and throughout our stay . Again thank you",4,2017,08,31
204,Fitzwilliam on the Green,"Excellent service from a very friendly and helpful staff with very good room amenities, but perhaps a little heavy on price.    Location is ideal.
It is a pity that the lounge area is not separated  from the entrance and the décor in that communal area is minimalistic. To my mind it does not reflect the warmth and cosiness of the rooms available to clients.   But that is probably a personal taste; I do not like sitting in corridors.    Overall however, a very pleasant stay.   Thank you.",4,2017,08,29
204,A very special experience,"The location, the quality, the rooms, the food and particularly the staff are all excellent. This was our second visit to Dublin to celebrate a special occasion and again the Fitzwilliam Hotel made it extra special.",5,2017,08,28
204,Solid hotel,"We stayed for two nights on a business trip. Positives are excellent staff, which in Dublin these days means they are drawn from a variety of nationalities, Rooms are tidy and if you get one with a balcony are nice. They are on the small side but well equipped,  The negatives - a soulless bar with limited offering and haphazard room service. We ordered the same dish two nights in a row as we were working and it looked different both nights. Better oversight of the menu preparation and food being delivered would help. We enjoyed our stay and I left ambivalent except the staff really make the day.",3,2017,08,28
204,Best service in Ireland and Scotland,"We had an excellent stay at their hotel in Belfast a week before and were in need of a quick reservation in Dublin for one night. The hotel accomdated us immediately and took excellent care of us. Their front door bellmen were fast, friendly, efficient and helpful with traffic advice. The front desk was also fast , courteous, efficient and full of good advice and recommendations. This was our best experience in a two week stay thoughout Ireland and Scotland and we stayed at four and five star hotels",5,2017,08,27
204,Australian visitor,Well located and  friendly helpful staff. breakfast top quality with fast service. Rooms well maintained and serviced. I would gladly stay here again on my next visit. My accomodation was booked by a third party so I cannot comment on relative cost vs value!,5,2017,08,27
204,Beautiful upmarket hotel!,"Beautifully designed hotel with modern finishes. The rooms were spacious, clean and updated with all the amenities you might require (including a much needed sewing kit!) Beds were very comfortable and water pressure was very good. Bath products were great! Staff were friendly and accommodating and the breakfast was excellent. I enjoyed my eggs royale! The location can not be beaten right across the park and a few minutes walk from many attractions. WiFi is free. The only negatives were that the noise does transfer into rooms so I used ear plugs, the carpet in my room was ratty around the edges and the gym is frankly pathetic. Tiny room with no windows with a treadmill, bike and crosstrainer. Two people barely fit! I'd almost suggest not having one at all....
This being said, I very much enjoyed my stay and would absolutely return.",5,2017,08,26
204,Nice Boutique Hotel,"The best thing about the Fitzwilliam is the location. It is across the street from Grafton Street and you can easily walk to Trinity College and the Temple Bar area. 
The service at the hotel was very good but our room was not the greatest. We were across the street from an office building so we had to keep our shades drawn. The bathtub was dangerous - way too high and difficult to get in and out and the water temperature was very difficult to get correct. We also had dinner here and although the staff was nice and courteous, the service was disjointed. Plan on a couple of hours if you wish to dine here. 
Still, the hotel was clean and comfortable and the location is excellent.",4,2017,08,25
204,Excellent,"Location and friendliness and helpfulness of the staff , couldn't have been better , couple of minor problems with room were quickly sorted and breakfasts excellent with again friendly staff, car parking also was safe and valet parking great",5,2017,08,24
204,Staff very friendly and helpful,"Very central location,  from we arrived until we left all staff were very friendly and helpful and were making sure we enjoyed our stay.  The food was excellent with a great selection for breakfast and great service.",5,2017,08,24
204,Great Hotel in Dublin!,The entire staff was beyond friendly and really made us feel welcomed. Rooms were very clean. It was really nice to arrive to such a nice hotel after an entire day of traveling to Ireland. I would definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin!,5,2017,08,23
204,Luxury in a great location,"Check-in was friendly & efficient, I arrived just after 2pm and while our room wasn’t ready I was offered a complimentary drink in the bar, which was most welcome after the drive up from Killarney. We came back to the hotel after damaging my credit card on Graffon St (the hotel is located at the top of the main shopping street in Dublin) and the Receptionist walked us up to our room, which was super luxurious & spacious, we especially loved the balcony. Breakfast (served until 12pm on Sunday, what a great idea!) was amazing, a great spread presented in a most appealing fashion and the service was immaculate. Again the check-out process was handled with efficiency and a nice friendly touch. All in all a fabulous hotel, with great staff in an amazing location.",5,2017,08,22
204,Top class hotel,"T.his is top class hotel. It is located very close to city centre. In a few moments one is on Grafton Street. It is ideal if one wants a night out _ walking distance of pubs and other prime locations. Luas stop across the street. 
  Top class food, service, rooms
",5,2017,08,22
204,Excellent ,Excellent hotel lovely decor great atmosphere great staff lovely views from the room big balcony to sit out on and look over Dublin food is good too have visited here twice and would definitely return in future ,5,2017,08,21
204,Great central location,"Brilliant hotel in a fantastic central location within walking distance of many great bars and restaurants. We had a 4th floor room looking onto the green which also had a balcony to sit out on, this was amazing. Staff are so friendly and very polite. This was a hotel we would definitely recommend! ",5,2017,08,21
204,Contemporary Luxury,"This beautiful, modern hotel is convenient to many attractions in Dublin. The rooms are spacious for European standards. There is a bar, 24 hour gym and 24 hour concierge. In addition, the hotel features two additional restaurants for finer dining. ",4,2017,08,21
204,Excellent hotel location and service,"My mother and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for several nights. I picked this hotel because of the positive reviews, location, and access to different places using a wheelchair for my mother. We had excellent service at the hotel throughout our trip. The hotel is in a perfect location to access shopping, food, and activities. If you need assistance, the concierge will help you arrange activities or assist you with directions. Brian, Ross,Tony, and Viktor are four members of the concierge who went out of their way with assistance during our stay. The service in The Inn of the Green and Citron located in the hotel were excellent. Rooms were quiet and I loved having the window seats to look over the garden courtyard. Room did have some wear and tear. If you have trouble stepping into a bathtub, ask for a room with a walking in shower instead. The hotel will be renovating this winter to upgrade the rooms along with the bathrooms. The housekeeping staff were very friendly and went out of their way if you needed anything as well. The Gaiety Theatre and St. Stephen's Green are right outside to your left of the hotel along with shopping on Grafton Street. Overall, the hotel was perfect for our visit and they treat you like family. I will be planning on visiting again in the future.",5,2017,08,18
204,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel in a location close to Grafton Street.. Very accommodating staff. Large and very clean room. Good and plentiful selection of food at breakfast and staff were very helpful in providing a vegetarian alternative to the Full Irish..Wold highly recommend,5,2017,08,18
204,Dublin Hotel,Good location with friendly staff. Close to many attractions in Dublin and has paid parking under the hotel. Nice breakfast in the hotel. Rooms are comfortable and clean thoughout with nice amenities included.,4,2017,08,17
204,Great location,"Ideally situated at the top of Grafton Street with easy access to shops, bars and restaurants. It is also across the road from the sanctuary of St Stephen's Green.
 
The hotel is clean and comfortable offering reasonable value with very friendly staff.",4,2017,08,15
204,happy time,I went to Dublin hoping for a good experience and was looked after brilliantly in the hotel. It was good for the things I wanted to see and in between I was able to entertain friends there and enjoy their company in the bar and the restaurant. Great.,5,2017,08,15
204,NOT 5 Star,"This property needs a total upgrade.  The staff need to know what I've booked and not try and lay blame for mistakes elsewhere.  The location was about all it had going for it.   Seriously overpriced for what you get right now.  Great location though.  The staff did try to rectify matters to give them their due, but you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear!",1,2017,08,15
204,Great Location! Superb service,"The hotel is located downtown, and hence close to everything from the train stations to the touristic sites.  Everything around us was a walking distance. The food in the restaurant was superb, the staff was very accommodating, and the wifi was excellent. Our flight back home was very early in the morning. The staff arranged for us to get coffee and a bag filled with water, pastry, and fruits. From the check in until the check out, you felt that they the staff went out of their way to make you happy. I would like to mention Paulina, who went the extra mile for us",5,2017,08,14
204,Another great stay at The Fitzwilliam,Great location and great staff. Hotel needs some updating though as rooms and corridors are showing their age and lack of upkeep - especially for the price point they operate in. Overall though will continue to recommend.,4,2017,08,14
204,Great Experience,"The hotel was located perfectly to everything, the rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was great.  The concierge desk was so helpful and gave us some great recommendation for both food and excursions. I have nothing but positive things to say regarding my stay.",5,2017,08,13
204,Dublin Horse Show,Very pleasant stay. Easy access out to the show by taxi. Good for shopping. Walking distance to a number of excellent restaurants. Very helpful pleasant staff. Thanks I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,08,13
204,Not a five star hotel,"a bad recommendation from our travel agent put us here versus the Shelbourne or the Westbury.  Many better choices in Dublin, so only stay here as your third or fourth choice.  Even the park view rooms simply look into the trees and the road construction (along with the homeless people).  The concierge was inept--could not make a dinner reservation.  And the restaurant is horrible--very low ceiling and located on a cramped mezzanine above the lobby.  Very expensive for what you get.",3,2017,08,12
204,Stay at Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We stayed at Fitzwilliam as a default location when we couldn't get into Merrion.  Although all previous comments are true that this is a centrally located hotel, there is no way this is a 5 star hotel.  This hotel is quite dated and in fact staff indicated there is a renovation scheduled sometime in the near future.  The breakfast, as well as breakfast location is mediocre at best.  Rooms are ok and as one previous guest stated, achieving the correct water temperature in the shower is a challenge and getting into the shower is a death defying feat due to the height of the tub. The reason why I gave this hotel a very good as it has an incredible staff.  From the front desk, housekeeping, wait staff in restaurant, everyone stands on their head to make this as best experience as they possibly can.  And their concierge staff is one of the best I have ever experienced in travel.  Hopefully they will embark on some renovation improvements in the hotel, and the environment will be consistent with their incredible staff.",4,2017,08,11
204,Nice hotel in heart of Dublin,"Weary travelers arriving in the morning from USA are greeted warmly, offered coffee and refreshments while our room is readied hours before check in time. We so appreciated this. The Fitzwilliam is modern and updated, but not lavish. Step out the front door and within steps you're on pedestrianized Grafton Street. The concierge booked Tickets for us to the Book of Kells at nearby Trinity College.  We ate a delicious early dinner at the hotel and walked 2 blocks to the Gaiety Theatre for Riverdance. Following a wonderful nights sleep, we enjoyed a substantial breakfast. Our experience at the Fitzwilliam was superior, and we highly recommend.",5,2017,08,11
204,Great location and service,"Not a 5 star hotel but very good... location is truly fantastic for eating, drinking and site seeing.  Service was tremendous.  Hotel is a bit dated, plenty of space in the standard queen room with a small sitting area and a large bathroom.  Shower is great but finding the right temp is like finding where track 4 begins on a record!  
",4,2017,08,11
204,Highly Recommend,"Wonderful staff -- knowledgeable and helpful.  Great location in Dublin -- near Grafton Street and all tours.  Kudos to the concierge staff, especially Tom (all were wonderful).   Breakfast in the mezzanine was a real treat.  Brought a horde of Irish cousins for a late dinner at the Citron Restaurant.  Food was good; staff was patient and courteous.  Would definitely return to the Fitzwilliam!

",5,2017,08,11
204,Excellent stay with superb friendly staff,"What a fantastic hotel!!
The location is amazing but too many times you book a hotel because of the location and that's all it has to offer. The Fitzwilliam, Dublin doesn't just stop at the front door - all the staff are extremely polite and helpful. I could see this by the reaction of other guest's who were visiting Dublin and possible Ireland for the first time asking question's and been given the time and attention supporting their every requirement. 
The food is outstanding using fresh locally sourced ingredients - try the Citron Restaurant then relax in the Bar.

Keep up the good work !!!!",5,2017,08,11

204,Wonderful experience!,"Our room was quiet and very clean with garden view. Excellent location. Staff was very helpful and extremely friendly. The breakfast was extensive with a great selection of various buffet foods as well as a la carte. The location could not have been better, right across the street from Steven's Green and a minute walk to Grafton Street.",5,2017,08,07
204,Birthday weekend,"Fab hotel, great location , wonderful staff  who couldn't be more helpful . We had a beautiful room lovely view, spotless hotel . Breakfast was delicious . Will be back in December . A wonderful hotel in a wonderful city . ",5,2017,08,07
204,Wonderful Hotel!,"We thought the Fitzwilliam - Belfast was great but their Dublin hotel was even better! Not to throw shade on Belfast, Dublin is just a bit more sophisticated. I was traveling with my two sons so we had three rooms and each was different. Beautifully decorated with all the amenities you'd expect from a 5 star accommodation, but each room with their own personality, if you will. Staff was top notch! The bar had an amazing selection of whiskeys and the bartender was well versed in his craft. The location was perfect! Central to attractions, shopping, and some great eateries. I'm relieved that I did not book a place in the very busy and overcrowded Temple Bar area. This location was busy but much less noise. I will definitely return to Dublin and to this hotel.",5,2017,08,06
204,Perfection is possible,"If you are staying in Dublin, this is the hotel to select! It is very clean, the staff is friendly the location is central to most anything, and in the evening when you go to sleep, it is quiet. This is truly a five star hotel. ",5,2017,08,06
204,Good location; poor breakfast service,"Good location. Seconds to Grafton Street. Very friendly front of house staff. Nice rooms, although my room was on the small side and the room and bathroom could probably do with a refurbishment. Very nice lobby area and bar. The letdown was the breakfast service with slow and (very) unfriendly service - especially compared to other hotel staff. On morning four I just got up and walked out after waiting 20 min to try and order (no hot buffet). Received an apology later and coffee in bar as compensation - but then drink was charged on checkout.",2,2017,08,05
204,Good hotel and very central,"We stayed here for a weekend - nice hotel , not quite sure about the decor of the rooms but it was OK. One excellent feature was the very powerful shower - really great though you need to leave the bathroom door open otherwise everything gets wet from condensation 
Very good central location - we walked to most places we wanted to see",4,2017,08,05
204,Where is the very helpful and friendly reception team?,"One night spent in Dublin on business and in all respects The Fitzwilliam Hotel met expectations. Nothing would have been too much trouble to the helpful and friendly team. If I had any suggestion for improvement it would be to provide a slightly less exclusive dining experience, without the need to spoon cereal into breakfast bowls using silver cutlery.

Secondly, the arrival experience could be tweaked as the check-in desk is tucked away in the corner of the lobby while a tourist information desk is most prominent in the hotel entrance.
",4,2017,08,05
204,Fantastic friendly service and great base to explore Dublin.,"All staff were very helpful, patient and friendly.  The rooms are first class and breakfast is excellent. Really can't fault the service and highly recommend the hotel. 

Dublin is a tremendous city and this hotel typified the friendly attitude we found all weekend. Nothing was too much trouble and whilst we knew that the bedrooms wouldn't be available until 3pm, when we arrived from the airport at 9am, the staff were excellent and offered our party of ten breakfast on the house. Definitely perared to go the extra mile to make our stay memorable.",5,2017,08,02
204,"Personalized service, great location","This hotel is located right on St. Stephen's Green, with easy access to all the main attractions in Dublin. What made our visit extra special was the assistance of Dane and Patrick at the concierge desk! From dinner reservations, to walking directions to Croke Park, to locating a driver for a trip up north at the last minute...all was handled with humor and ease! We received a super early check in after our overnight flight too. Small room, but fine for a few days. Dublin is a fun city!",5,2017,08,01
204,Very inconvenient start to ou rstay,"We had a very unfortunate start when the air conditioning in the room was broken, and it took several hours and a number of calls to service staff to confirm it was broken and convince management to move us to another room.  Other than that, the hotel was fine.",3,2017,08,01
204,Great stay,Unbeatable location. Great staff.  Small room and bathroom. It was a pleasant stay overall. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The bar area is very nice. The restaurant serves pretty good breakfast. ,4,2017,08,01
204,Great service and location,"We chose the Fitzwilliam Hotel for its location and we did not go wrong. You could explore the entire city on foot. There are tramway works going on in front of the hotel, which did not bother us at all. However, please make sure you pick the room carefully: more expensive rooms overlooking the park maybe exposed to noise. We were perfectly happy with our quiet, courtyard looking room (Superior Room). 

The room layout is modern and smartly done, I would have just preferred some extra storage space (a lot of space is taken by safe/mini bar), perhaps a little refurbishment one day would make it more practical.

But what makes the big difference in this hotel is the service and kindness of the team, from check-in until check-out. Concierge service was very efficient and proactive, porters tried to anticipate any needs, breakfast service was fast and impeccable (breakfast as a whole I would say) and prompt check in and check out. People made you feel at home and went out of the way to give you advice, approach you in your own language, etc.

The only negative I would have to warn against is the pricing policy. Their website advertises lower rates when booking in advance but in fact we should have waited and booked last minute. Prices in fact go down and by quite a lot. Since we stayed in June, I had time to do check this for other dates and it was the same thing... Well, when you get this through brokers you know it is part of the game, but when I it is the hotel itself... I wish they would have a transparent pricing policy. If they did, they would just be perfect!!",5,2017,07,31
204,Fell a little short,"We stayed in a twin room on a busy Saturday night in Dublin. The location is great and our room was comfortable and quiet. The bathroom could do with a spruce up and the bath has high sides when climbing out of the shower. We had booked a table in Citron for dinner on the strength of a website offer which was repeated on the hotel TV channel. When we went to the restaurant we were told only an early bird offer existed. The food was OK but with a bill in excess of 100 euro we would have gone elsewhere. The restaurant lacks atmosphere and as its a mezzanine there is a constant draught from the front door.
I have spoken to staff in the hotel but no resolution given. Not sure I would stay again given the room rates . There is better value available in Dublin.",3,2017,07,31
204,Great Hotel in Perfect Central Location,Enjoyed our stay immensely. Room was clean and modern. Service at the front desk and concierge desk were friendly and made great recommendations.  Central location on the Green allowed us to walk everywhere. ,5,2017,07,31
204,Great Dublin City centre hotel,"Quirky, but stylish, roof top room in a fantastic location. Great service and incredibly helpful people as we were travelling with a disabled relative. So close to all the good stuff. Can't wait to go back. ",4,2017,07,30
204,Beautiful hotel and lovely Staff,Stayed here with my wife as a treat with evening meal and afternoon tea highly recommend the room was excellent and the staff couldn't have been more helpful ..... will definitely be back it's also in a great location for many of Dublin's attractions and we were able to get to the Comedy Festival at the Iveagh Gardens which was just a 5 minute walk ,5,2017,07,30
204,super location,"location couldn't be better, walk out the front door to stephens green, grafton street and hop on the luas tram. staff are lovely and I regularly meet people for coffee in the lobby, its so relaxed and chilled out. the bedrooms and conference rooms are really good.",5,2017,07,29
204,Staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel,We enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The service was helpful and friendly. They lent us umbrellas when it rained. The location was perfect for visiting Dublin.Breakfast was delicious. the rooms were convenient and well appointed.,5,2017,07,29
204,Fabulous Fitzwilliam,"Fabulous in every respect is not hyperbole.  Centrally located across the street from St. Stephen's Green, within walking distance to most central Dublin points of interest (actually within walking distance to almost everything) and a near-luxury accommodation makes this a top spot in my book.  The breakfast buffet or menu is a very reasonable option also.
If you have the option, consider staying in the rooms with balcony overlooking the St. Stephen's Green; they are lovely.  Our internal view of the courtyard is quite nice too.
Not atypical of most European hotel rooms, space is tight; although, it is just fine!",5,2017,07,28
204,Excellent Introduction to Dublin!,"After just completing our first trip to Dublin, we can't say enough wonderful things about not only the Fitzwilliam Hotel, but it's staff. Prior to arrival, concierge was extremely accommodating with planning airport transportation, providing restaurant recommendations, etc. Upon arrival, they were friendly and warm, and continued this way for the entire week we were visiting. They provided amazing restaurant recommendations  (ex: Fade Street Social, Hatch & Sons), great Irish pubs (ex: P. Macs) and ""must sees"" in Dublin, many off of the beaten path and avoiding the tourist traps (ex: Temple Bar). They also recommended (and arranged for) a great round of golf at Royal Dublin, and suggested checking out Malahide Castle and getting lunch in Howth - all on the coast and wonderful! We can't say enough great things about this hotel or it's staff, especially Dane and Vicktor. We can't wait to return!",5,2017,07,27
204,Wonderful stay and Staff!,"We only got to stay one night, but it was a wonderful experience. The staff made our stay just perfect. Victor lined up our reservations for dinner, our car return and a cab to the airport before we even arrived - just made it so easy for us. I really liked our room and view too. Just a good experience and wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2017,07,27
204,Great retreat,"We loved our sense of safety, and the combination of the rooms overlooking the courtyard, the sound of the seagulls, the cosy room, the bar, the staff and all the help everyone gave us made us feel that we had a soft landing after a long and awful flight to Ireland.  We'd go back without even looking at alternatives next time we are in Dublin.  ",5,2017,07,27
204,"Ideally located, comfortable, and staff who are friendly and customer focussed","Dublin hotels are not cheap and Fitzwilliam no exception. However, this is a prime location, with lots to see and do within easy walking distance. Noise from work on tram system a bit annoying but it is almost finished. Management has ensured that its staff make the effort to engage with customers, be friendly, and smile. Simple stuff that is often forgotten but which makes an enormous difference to the customer experience, so well done!",4,2017,07,27
204,Excellent hotel,Wonderful staff and beautiful hotel. Easy location to good restaurants and the airport. The staff were gracious and helpful. The room met all our needs. My friend and I would like to stay here again when we visit Dublin.,5,2017,07,27
204,Perfect location,We picked this hotel for the location and found it to be a gem in terms of service and amenities.  The hotel is within walking distance to city sights.  Friendly staff and very helpful concierge.  We will be back!,5,2017,07,25
204,Perfect location,Perfect location - but very expensive - may have been because U2 concert was on and most hotels in Dublin were fully booked. Shower pressure was like a waterfall. Breakfast area was small but the staff were incredibly fast and efficient.,4,2017,07,25
204,Extraordinary Service,"We chose the hotel for its location and on the recommendation, ironically, of the Shelbourne.  We attempted to book the Shelbourne but it was sold out.  The Shelbourne is arguably the premiere hotel in Ireland.  We've stayed there and loved it.  However, our experience at the fitzwilliam hotel will have us returning here the next time we are in Dublin.  Their staff genuinely takes an interest in your experience and our extremely competent to assist you with anything at anytime.",5,2017,07,25
204,Super Stay,"Wonderful staff, exceptional room with a fantastic location. Welcome on arrival was a very nice touch and a great way to start the weekend. Well appointed rooms with lots of space. We'll definitely be back!",5,2017,07,24
204,Excellent hotel handy to Dublin shopping and Entertainment,"Great hotel and service for a long weekend in Dublin to watch U2 in concert. One of the best hotel breakfast offerings I have experienced and dinner was also exceptional.
Friendly staff and comfortable, well appointed room. 
Not cheap but competitive with other 4/5 star Dublin hotels. Recommended.",4,2017,07,24
204,Lovely place. ,"Conveniently located hotel. Great staff, nice service. Very American hotel - they even set up a tAke away coffee corner for the mornings if you don't want breakfast . Hotel was kind enough to hold our bags 2 days after our departure. ",4,2017,07,23
204,Perfect from start to finish ,"We love staying at The Fitzwilliam when we stay in Dublin , mainly for concerts .
This time we stayed for one night whilst seeing U2 , wish it could have been more.
The hotel is so stylish and comfortable . From the prosecco on arrival to pillow chocolates , every nice touch is there , including an umbrella. 
Great rooms and bathrooms.
Service is superb , such friendly staff. 
Can't wait to return. ",5,2017,07,23
204,"Fine, but issues","We stayed here on short notice, having had an AirBNB disaster. The staff were wonderful in finding us rooms next to each other, given we were two couples. However, one room had a heavy odour of cigarette smoke, so we needed to move. Otherwise was fine - expensive for what it is probably, but not outrageous.",3,2017,07,23
204,Excellent and gorgeous,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel was recommended to me by my clients when I went to Dublin on a business trip. The room was lovely, the bathroom was spacious, great food, fabulous location, friendly staff, I had a wonderful experience.",5,2017,07,22
204,Great Hotel in Dublin Centre,"I Only stayed one night and had an early departure, but the hotel was in a great location and very clean throughout. Room was nice and comfortable too. Staff were very helpful as well as efficient. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2017,07,21
204,All Good,It was all good. I have stayed here many times and always do when I stay in Dublin. I think the staff are very friendly and the location is splendid. I would highly recommend it to anyone. The rooms are clean and the beds very comfortable. ,4,2017,07,19
204,Dublin Stay,"Excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam - will recommend it to my relatives - staff was very helpful and the food and drink was great.  Room was comfortable and everything was centrally located.  Being near the green and shopping is a plus - Temple Bar, etc.

",5,2017,07,19
204,Fabulous hotel. Recommend a courtyard room,Stayed in the fitzwilliam hotel again to celebrate my husband's birthday.  Absolutely delighted with the room. It was fabulous with a balcony overlooking a quiet courtyard.  It was amazingly quiet for city centre dublin.  Highly recommended. ,5,2017,07,19
204,Dublin sojourn,"Dublin sojourn was magic. Loved the hotel fab location perfect for shopping, visiting the National Gallery and dining at restaurant in the evening staff hugely friendly and most helpful. We will return. ",5,2017,07,18
204,1st trip to Ireland,"Great location close to great shopping and restaurants/ pubs.
The front desk attendants & concierge are fantastic. Irish breakfast included is wonderful with wide arrange of choices. Rooms are very clean & comfortable ",5,2017,07,17
204,Riverdance break Dublin,"We came to Dublin to see Riverdance. The Fitzwilliam had the perfect location and was the utmost in style, quality and calibre of staff. First class hotel, first class service. Wonderful all round. From reception and porters, who were friendly and exceptionally helpful, to the stunning cuisine and marvellous surroundings, the level of attention to detail and service turned a short break into a memorable experience. We were treated with personal service as if we were the only guests and the food was of a level unsurpassed. Thank you to all the staff who were so warm and genuine. We will be back!!",5,2017,07,17
204,"Excellent location, excellent staff. Got upgraded on check in so that was a nice bonus, beautiful room, great experience","Got upgraded on check in so that was a nice bonus. Beautiful room, a little on the small side but very nice all the same. Location excellent to see the heart of Dublin and staff were so pleasant and helpful, a credit to the hotel.",5,2017,07,16
204,Fitzwilliam was amazing!,The staff here is excellent - so friendly and helpful. From the moment we pulled up to the front door they went out of their way to help us. The rooms are beautiful and clean. The breakfast was delicious! We will definitely stay here again should we ever come back to Dublin.,5,2017,07,15
204,A sausage in a sauage factory,"One of those hotels that if you don't ask you don't get. 
If you don't kick up a fuss on check in you will be given the smallest room on the floor as they try to palm it off on some. 
If you don't ask for your room to be fully cleaned you'll return on the 2nd night to find last nights mess still in your room.
Positives: Location is great, staff are very friendly as you walk about, and the rooms are nicely executed.  ",2,2017,07,14
204,Not a 5 star experience,"We stayed in a Superior room overlooking other rooms in the hotel.  There are only 8 rooms per floor that face Stephens Green.  The location is loud and rowdy.  Homeless people lay in front of the hotel.  The room was packed full of uncomfortable furniture that was painful to sit on.  They definitely were going for a look rather than comfort.  After 4 hours on a rather warm day in Dublin, we noticed our air conditioning was not working.  We were moved to a Signature room, as it was the only one available.  It was smaller than the first,  faced the room we left,and was equally uncomfortable. We were given free parking and breakfast for our inconvenience.  Because of a concert in town, our rate was 499.00 euros.  I can honestly say it was not worth half of that. If you are looking for a comfortable and modern place to stay in Dublin, go to the Marker and avoid the Fitzwilliam like the potato famine.",3,2017,07,12
204,Well Appointed Hotel in Great Location,The Fitzwilliam is in a great location and has a friendly helpful staff. There is easy access to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.   The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Check in was a breeze and the glass of prosecco was a nice touch.  ,4,2017,07,12
204,Smooth Perfection,A fantastic week in Dublin was made even more so by the superb staff at the Fitzwilliam who were so pleasant and cheerful that it put our minds at ease immediately. It made the city even prettier !!!!,5,2017,07,12
204,Not exactly the same.,"This was my third stay at this hotel and it wasn't exactly the same as my prior visits. That said, the location is fantastic and the staff was friendly and accommodating. An expensive hotel for what you get. ",3,2017,07,11
204,Very good value in Dublin,"Comfortable place for a stay in Dublin. Staff always very nice, breakfast room new and perfect to start your day, bedroom very comfortable and clean. Nice to have on the wall here and there explanations of the historic building and the life and families that lived there.

Bathroom need an update. Shower was new so the tiles but washing basin need to be replaced.",4,2017,07,11
204,Didn't live up to our expectations!,"Not as we expected given the costly room rate and reviews. We chose this hotel as it seemed luxurious and 5 star but it didn't live up to our expectations at all. Very noisy if you are located on the street side. Although we loved the glass of prosecco on arrival (nice touch) I couldn't really rate it above average as we had trouble with our room, and generally I didn't feel it was value for money.",3,2017,07,10
204,Best hotel and staff!,"Three couples stayed for two nights at hotel and absolutely loved it! Each and every staff member  was very helpful and friendly. We only had breakfast two days at dining room and one employee/waiter stood out among the rest! Cant recall his name but cheery,happy, and outstanding svc! Best hotel stay in Ireland ",5,2017,07,10
204,great location,"The hotel is perfectly located at the beginning of a pedestrian shopping and restaurant center.  The park was just across the street.  The staff is very guest oriented.  Easy to walk anywhere, from hotel.
",5,2017,07,10
204,"Good location, nice hotel","Great location -- right across St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  Staff was friendly, breakfast was great. Wifi was good. Clean, modern, updated rooms. Business center was great for when I needed to print a few items. The printer was out of paper when I was there but I called and a staff member came down in seconds to refill. I really liked this hotel!",4,2017,07,09
204,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location!","We usually stay in a different hotel when we go to the city but from now on we will be staying in the Fitzwilliam. The staff are extremely warm, welcoming & helpful. Valet parking is so handy. We ordered room service from the late night menu, it only took 30 minutes to come to the room. The food was hot & very tasty, honestly the best room service experience we have had.
The location is perfect! We were attending an Aslan concert in iveagh gardens so it was only a short distance from the venue. Perfect! 
We're looking forward to our next visit",5,2017,07,09
204,wonderful hotel and staff to match,Excellent hotel.   We would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin.  Our travel agent made the reservation and said it was the type of hotel we generally travel with and would love.   She was correct.   Staff are well trained and very service oriented. Nice hotel in every manner a traveler would expect.  Wonderful city and a hotel to match!!!,5,2017,07,07
204,Wonderful property - Highly recommend,"I stayed here for a few days at the start of my UK trip. I arrived early and was quickly checked-in. The front desk staff and concierge was attentive and prompt. Very happy with the check-in process. When I got into the room, everything was clean, warm and inviting. A lovely space. Loved the bathroom - and the bathtub.

I ordered room service for breakfast and dinner and received delicious meals. I was there during the July 4th holiday and received a gift from the chef - a cupcake with red and blue sprinkles on top of white buttercream icing. The cake was green, which was a nice touch. 

Everything was very thoughtful - the minor details made a difference.",5,2017,07,06
204,Highly recommend,We had a wonderful stay! The staff was friendly and helpful! We loved having a big breakfast every morning! The food was delicious! We dined as well and enjoyed our meal. The location was perfect for our needs.,5,2017,07,06
204,Excellent service,"One of the best hotels in Dublin when it comes to service. They tended to my every need, and every staff member in the hotel was amazing. Honestly I have not been to any hotel in any country that has better, friendlier staff than this hotel. It made the whole trip. Only downside was the room. Construction was going on, and it would have been nice to have been informed about it upfront. We had a terrace room overlooking st Stephens green. There really wasn't much to look at, and the construction was loud at night. The rooms overlooking the garden would have been a much better recommendation. Also don't expect to see the green at all. You only see tree tops. Not a great view in my opinion. ",5,2017,07,05
204,BRILLIANT HOTEL. EXCELLENT STAFF,"
I cannot possibly recommend the hotel more for value and service, 5 star all the way food was excellent, and staff from the door men to the wait staff superb. great location too, i will be back, best hotel experience in dublin ",5,2017,07,05
204,Beautiful hotel with modern amenities in the heart of Dublin,"If you're looking for a hotel that offers luxury and modern amenities this I your place. It is a beautiful space and the rooms are lovely, updated and well appointed. The staff were so friendly and treated us like royalty. I wish I could have had a couple more nights.",5,2017,07,05
204,Stay at Fitzwilliam Hotel,"Staff was excellent and extremely friendly and helpful. They can't do enough for you!   My sons birthday was the following day. Our flight was very early in the morning.  They heard it was his birthday and brought up a cupcake with a candle fruit and ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate syrup. So kind and unbelievably thoughtful.  He was so surprised! Rooms are beautiful.  Great location ",5,2017,07,05
204,Best hotel in Dublin,"Great location, right in the heart of Dublin and 10 second walk from Grafton Street, The Luas tram line and 10 minutes from Temple bar.   I've stayed at the Fitz 50+ times and I have never found any reason to be disappointed.  The staff are always extremely polite, helpful and efficient.  The rooms are consistently in good order, well presented, clean and well stocked.   I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin, it is worth the additional cost.",5,2017,07,05
204,Lovely Stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We just returned to the states from a fantastic stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The staff was extremely pleasant, the rooms were spacious and comfortable, and above all, the location cannot be beat. We were able to walk to everything! We had a great time and would definitely stay there again on a future trip. ",5,2017,07,04
204,Skip's Visit,"Excellent location, very friendly staff, large rooms -- the perfect storm! Our room was spacious and located in the garden area, thus a very quiet setting. Location can not be overstated as being ideal -- at the doorstep of Grafton Street. Tried the bar once and found the martinis and cosmos to be excellent. Staff could not have been helpful. We'll be back! ",5,2017,07,03
204,A luxurious experience,"I booked the hotel as a surprise for my wife's 40th birthday. Being a teacher, I wasn't accustomed to paying such a high rate for an overnight stay. The hotel and its staff exceeded both my wife and my expectations. From the friendly staff to the added touches they provided to help my wife celebrate in style, it made the day my wife's favourite birthday ever. Yay me and a big thank you to the hotel's incredible staff. As a tip, if you're all toured out and would like to enjoy a quiet and delicious meal, I would highly recommend the three course dinner at Citron, the restaurant on site.",5,2017,07,03
204,Excellent stay for business traveler,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a week; the rooms were nicely appointed and comfortable; albeit on the smaller side. I was impressed by the staff's helpfulness - I arrived well before check in time, and they did all they could to make me comfortable. The location is excellent - which helped fit in some wandering and sight-seeing even with tight business schedule. Thank you, and I will certainly want to stay here again! ",5,2017,07,02
204,"Arrives before 7am, they took care of us ","Very nice place, service with a smile. Arrived super early for a 4pm check-in and they got a room ready for us ASAP, like 10 mins. Very hospitable. Nice location, great room with terrace. Off to breakfast, more later.",5,2017,07,02
204,Outstanding and wonderful staff,Outstanding staff friendly courteous friendly knowledgeable great breakfast location spectacular a must near green we enjoyed the hospitality and found the room comfortable and the pillows and staff excellent ,5,2017,07,01
204,Great location for this Holiday Inn,"We stayed with 2 kids at Fitzwilliam Hotel. We had two adjoining rooms. The hotel is in a great location and staff is super friendly, but the rooms, furnishing, food at the restaurants reminds me of Holidays Inn in the 80th... need a major face lift for sure.",2,2017,06,30
204,Good location,This hotel is in the perfect location if you are visiting Dublin. Close to many attractions and the shops. Rooms quite good and breakfasts equally good. Atmosphere a bit lacking but the location is the big plus.,4,2017,06,29
204,Anthony's Review,The location was perfect to get a good flavor of Dublin. The staff was very professional and engaged in their jobs. I would recommend this location to anyone. The only thing i would do different is plan further ahead so we could get a bigger room. None was available when we booked this trip.,5,2017,06,26
204,Highly recommend,Thank you Fitzwilliam for a memorable overnight stay we will be returning.  The staff are courteous and professional and the breakfast was clean and fresh and complimentary which was a lovely surprise along with the chocolate and fruit plate and the bottle of wine...........little things mean a lot.,5,2017,06,26
204,Luxury and Convenience,"A quality hotel right at the heart of the city centre with excellent staff and well appointed rooms. My only complaint is that you have to shower standing in the bath tub. Perhaps to ease the pain in the wallet they could throw in breakfast ""for free"". ",4,2017,06,25
204,Decent conference venue,"Came here for a user group meeting. 

Good facilities (projecter, wifi). Lunch was good. Helpful staff. Nice bar with simple but tasty eats. 

Central location is obviously great if you're staying, but a bit of a 'mare if you need to get back to the airport in a hurry due to the roadworks for the tram: give some extra time at the moment.",3,2017,06,24
204,Noisy ventilation,Noisy ventilation required room change at 2am from 5th floor to 2nd floor which was perfectly quiet didn't get a lot of sleep staff very helpful hope the prob is repaired night staff offered to move my luggage took me to room 225 to inspect and listen for noisy ventilation perfectly quiet no droning from impellers thankfully bill reduced by 100 euros still very tired,3,2017,06,24
204,Posh night in Dublin ,Just back from our stay here. An amazing hot excellent location and very friendly and welcoming staff who couldn't do enough for you. The meal we had in the restaurant was beautiful and filling. The room we had had a balcony over looking st Stephen green park. The room was perfect and the bathroom was massive.  The breakfast was the best we've had  there was so much to choose from either the hot breakfast or cold buffet everything was beautiful couldn't fault anything. We will definitely be back.,5,2017,06,24
204,Robbie Tour,"Great location for our 25th wedding anniversary celebrations, with friends.  Super hotel, will hopefully return in the future. Short walk into city centre. Breakfast was great. Fabulous service. Mix a great Gin cocktail too!",5,2017,06,24
204,For this level of hotel,"Location-check, friendly and helpful-check, good room aircon-check (important to me as I was there during record heat). But for the price it is just an average experience. Citron offers average food for the price, but for those prices there are much better restaurants within a short walk. Rooms are a bit tired. ",3,2017,06,23
204,Trying too hard,"I realize newer hotels need to go ""over the top"" to be in the running against their competition.  This property is very interesting to visit and the bar areas are scattered throughout and popular with those staying as well as locals .  As for our room, we (and our young adult children who can figure out just about anything) could not figure out the lights-  if you got them on one way, they did not work another. They were simply ""too high tech"".  Our daughter told us she slept with the light on in he bathroom and just cracked the door.  The shower is in the tub- not just any tub but one that needs a step stool to climb over.  Great if you want to soak but for the rest of us maneuvering in and out to take a shower  was a chore.  The complicated hot and cold knobs were expensive I am sure, but they did not keep a constant temperature so I was continually adjusting it.  The bedding was great.  This room would look wonderful in a picture , but just not practical .",3,2017,06,22
204,Nice hotel with friendly personnel,"Good hotel with a very nice, friendly and helpful personnel. The 6th floor is a bit noisy probably because of some aircon on the roof.
Nice bar and good selection of food at breakfast.
I would recommend this hotel; just try to avaoid the 6th floor ;)",4,2017,06,22
204,Cleanliness,"Bathroom not very clean . Dripping tap .No extractor fan , if there was it was not working  Strong smell in lift from carpet (not a good idea )  Drinks very expensive . When asked for a cold Prosecco ice was added.",1,2017,06,21
204,Wonderful Hotel in Dublin,"The staff, the location, the amenities and the service at the Fitzwilliam could not have been better.  Our room had a lovely patio that overlooked St. Stephan's Green.  The bathroom was lovely as well.  I will be staying here the next time I am in Dublin.  ",5,2017,06,20
204,"Great location, super staff","in the midst of Dublin Centre so fewer than 15 minutes walk from most places I wanted to go and easy bus access to the rest. Pricey, but understandable for the location and quality of the hotel. The staff is exceptional!",4,2017,06,20
204,Top rate in excellent location,"Great service from the minute we arrived until departure.
All staff very helpful and pleasant to deal with. Will definitely return and recommend to others.
Excellent location - made our weekend so stress free.",5,2017,06,19
204,High price for average quality,"This is an expensive hotel with good location. 
The quality does not correspond to the price, however.
There were many waiters and other personnel, but most of them were unnecessary and just delayed the services provided.",3,2017,06,19
204,Taste of Dublin visit,"Fantastic location and staff.
Would be great all round if they could have some sound proofing on bedroom doors for the corridor as you may well be woken with people returning to rooms in the early hours",4,2017,06,19
204,Wonderful Fitzwilliam,"Everything was perfect about our four day stay. Suite 453 overlooking the courtyard was very quiet and private.  The decor was fresh and bright with  orchids all around the rooms and common areas. On St Stephen's Green, it has the perfect.  The concierge team are awesome.",5,2017,06,16
204,Perfect hotel,The location on St. Stephen's Green is excellent. Most everything is within walking distance. The staff is very nice. They did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. The breakfast was fantastic. ,5,2017,06,16
204,"Nice Location, friendly & hospitable staff","The location was excellent and the staff were kind despite our disheveled & jet lagged appearance. The ladies kindly took our bags and offered to text us when a room was free. There is no lift to certain floors but they delivered our bags to the appropriate room. Our window looked out onto a narrow alley and was very quiet. The rooms facing St. Stephen's Green may have a lovely view but I'm sure they are noisy with the construction areas, tourists, etc. If I remember correctly the bed only had a duvet, so you may need to bring a thin sheet if you get hot easily but want to be covered.",5,2017,06,16
204,Couldn't fault it!,"We moved here because our previous hotel was a shocker! We left that hotel ( we couldn't stand it any longer!)and rocked up to the Fitzwilliam at 9:30pm looking very disheveled and extremely tired. A combination of jet lag and a previously noisy room did not make us happy campers!
So it was lovely to find happy friendly staff. 
Very comfy, QUITE and clean rooms. 
The food was very nice too. Would stay again.",5,2017,06,15
204,Dublin,Staff were great and very helpful .Great to have the day room to freshen up when we arrived .The staff had our bags and room ready for us that evening.

204,Peaceful,"Continue to grow . I loved the little touches fresh fruit and flowers everywhere. I made a request after my translantic flight I was exhausted, I arrived at the Hotel about 6am  the staff made me a priority, I had breakfast, soon after, my room was ready, I was so very grateful . Thank you for helping me.",5,2017,06,12

204,JUNE 6/7 2017,"The rooms were clean and the service was good.  The construction noise was a serious issue that unfortunately cannot be addressed until the work is completed, but the hotel could have offered some sort of consolation for the incredible inconvenience. ",4,2017,06,08
204,Customer service at its' best ,"Well the hotel is one of the best we've ever stayed in! From our check in to our check out we had an unbelievable time with the staff that they're all willing to assist you, they know your needs and they do their best to offer you some unforgettable travel memories! We thank each and every single one of them! Congratulations to the human department for the wise choices of such a wonderful personell!! 
Now the hotel is also great, very modern and cozy close to everything you may need. The rooms are spacious, well decorated, comfortable and very quiet. We had a car but you can easily reach the hotel with the train where there's a station  very close to the hotel. 
All in all we loved our time there and we appreciate all the efforts that have been made for us so as to have an enjoyable stay!",5,2017,06,07

204,Excellent Hotel!,"We were in Europe for 2 weeks, our first stop was Dublin and the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  From the moment we exited the cab to the moment we left our expectations were shattered by the customer service this hotel offers.  Every staff member was kind, helpful, and willing to the offer any help and advice needed.  We saw no other hotel in Europe with this service.  We got spoiled on our first stop!",5,2017,06,06
204,Fabulous as always!,"The room was immaculate, the bed was super comfortable, the staff was very friendly, the location is perfect for visiting Dublin, right in the heart of the city, close to shopping and restaurants, will definitely come back!",5,2017,06,06
204,Perfect honeymoon,We chose the hotel for a couple of days away to relax after our wedding and it was perfect. The room (facing over the internal courtyard) was beautiful and one of the quietest we've ever stayed in. The location was great with everything within walking distance and the staff were lovely. We had a lovely stay and will definitely be back.,5,2017,06,04
204,Perfect hotel is beautiful city.,"Great location between lovely St. Stephens Green and lively pedestrian area. The rooms are large and comfortable with large TVs, lots of pillows, and the best bathtub ever. The staff, from the people at the door to the ones who cleaned the room, were always helpful, friendly, kind, and cheerful. Perfect experience.",5,2017,06,04
204,Five Star for European Standards,"The rooms were nice, very standard. Clean and spacious with robes in the washroom. This is definitely a luxury hotel but if it was an American hotel I would give it a 4-4.5 star. Stars and hotels levels in Europe are held to a different level. Compared to other European 4 stars this is definitely a five star. 

The staff was so so friendly! Just in general, in Dublin, everywhere we went, all staff were incredibly friendly. Very helpful. 

We ordered breakfast to the room - I would not recommend. Definitely go down to the actual breakfast area. The portions were very small and they forgot a few items. 

We were only there for 1 night but we really enjoyed our stay. Great location! Everything is a 5-20mins distance. And its right next to Dublin's famous shopping street with great restaurants too.",5,2017,06,03
204,On business,A great place to stay in the centre of Dublin for business close to good bars and places to eat.  Staff are very helpful and friendly and I would recommend it to anyone. I did not try the restaurant but the food looked good from the menu,5,2017,06,03
204,Dublin visit,"Our family had a wonderful stay as this was our first time in Ireland. The staff was so extremely helpful with tours, recommendations and always directions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going ",4,2017,06,02
204,Modern Luxury,"This modern, but comfortable hotel on the NW corner of St Stephens Green( a large park) is attached to a shopping mall. It is on the southern edge of Dublin's major urban shopping district and is in walking distance of innumerable restaurants, bars and museums. The rooms are spacious and despite night time work on a light rail system( jackhammers), the rooms are quiet.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had plenty of storage space, with a shower that kept the water temperature constant. This is the most expensive hotel we stayed in throughout our trip in Ireland, but we thought the quality of the facility and the attentiveness of the staff were worth it.
We took the bus #145  from the Dublin train station, which let us off at the northeast side of the square at # 50( Fitzwilliam is #7 St Stephens Green). We had a 5 minute walk to the hotel.",5,2017,06,02
204,"Excellent location, comfortable room","The location, right next to the St Stephens Green and the LUAS stop (light rail), and Grafton Street for great shopping.  Plenty of nearby places to eat and drink.  And just far enough from party central, aka Temple Bar area.

Nice and elegant hotel, decent rooms, spacious enough, comfortable beds.  The bathrooms were nice but the shower kept leaking over the tub near the fixtures, which was a pain.  Otherwise excellent location, highly recommend.  ",5,2017,06,01
204,Best Duty Manager Ever,"As mentioned above, Duty manager Josefina Armengol, was truly a delight. If she hadn't been working, we would have taken her out to dinner with us..The Concierge staff was extremely helpful; the wait staff were very attentive and responsive to our needs.",5,2017,06,01
204,Don't miss this experience,Fantastic experience all around. Can't wait to go back. Wonderful staff. Fantastic front desk experience. Central location across from st Stephens green. I love the Dublin fitzwilliam. Thank you staff. ,5,2017,06,01
204,"Great location, friendly staff, nice rooms, good food","I stayed here for 4 days with my family. No complaints whatsoever. There are tonnes of shops just outside the hotel. It's within walking distance of the castle, river and museums. There's also a nice green area outside. The tram line is literally at the hotel's doorstep. 
The choice of food isn't huge but still very good. The breakfast buffet wasn't massive but lots of choices of hot food that's prepared freshly so absolutely no complaints there.
The staff are very efficient and friendly. 
Would definitely recommend this hotel for business and pleasure.",5,2017,06,01
204,"Location, location, location","We were able to walk to pubs, park and shopping.  Staff were attentive and helpful.  Had a slow faucet drIp.  Reserved a stay with breakfast but had to leave early before breakfast opened and not offered a comparable room delivery.",4,2017,05,29

The staff were friendly and very accommodating, the included amenities were fantastic, the location was great for either staying in or going out for a night on the town, many of Dublin's best attractions are within walking distance, and all meals provided were great.  If you're looking for an upscale location during a vacation to Dublin, look no further.",5,2017,05,27
204,A wonderful hotel in a great location.,We stayed at this wonderful hotel two weeks ago and cannot wait to return. We had a room on the 5th floor overlooking the Park with a balcony to enjoy drinks. The staff was great and the hotel is located in easy walking distance to great restaurants and historic locations. One of the best hotels we have stayed at in years!,5,2017,05,26
204,"Smart hotel, friendly staff","Firstly, a super central location opposite the green and seconds from the main shopping street. 

A smart standard room at the back, quiet with an open outlook. Not the biggest, but very well kept, clean, with decent furniture and fittings and a modern bathroom with a good supply of toiletries. 

Good breakfast range of food. 

And very friendly and helpful staff. 

I was staying on business so can't comment on price/value for money. ",4,2017,05,26
204,The Staff Made All the Difference,"The location of this hotel is just perfect, the rooms are delightful, but what really sets it apart is how it takes care of its guests.  Every single person I encountered was nothing short of delightful.  From the check in experience to check out and the barman in between all were hyper customer care focused, professional, and charming.  ",5,2017,05,25
204,EXCELLENT HOTEL,"centrally located and very good service from everybody the room was very nice breakfast was delicious and breakfast a la carte was included as well, i would go back for sure. i used the gym and it was a plus",5,2017,05,25
204,Very comfortable stay; upper end of price range but you get what you pay for; everything in walking distance,"It was nice to not need a car.  We could walk to anywhere we needed in about 5-10 minutes.  Pedestrian shopping area is just around the block.  Many great restaurants and coffee shops nearby.

It is a little more expensive than we would normally pay; however, its location made it worthwhile.  Staff are very friendly and helpful, but I would do my own research for recommended restaurants than ask the concierge... didn't have much luck with their results.

Quiet and comfortable rooms.  They had a music console that you can connect your device and the speakers are in the wall (and in the bathroom)... so you can have your playlist going while taking a shower :-). It didn't support Bluetooth but at least there was a Line In to plug in my pod (as you have the male/male cable).  Plenty of outlets to charge devices, free wifi (pretty good bandwidth).  Very comfortable beds and good A/C.",4,2017,05,24
204,Perfect location and a lovely hotel.,"Everything about this hotel was perfect. The location, the service, and the room were wonderful. The staff will do anything for you to ensure that you have a pleasant stay. The location on St. Stephen's Green was beautiful. The room was immaculate.",5,2017,05,24
204,"Noisy,noisy,noisy.",Drunken partying on the street in front of the hotel until 5.00am kept us awake most of the night and it was week-day! Apparently there was nothing the hotel could do about it. Ask for room at the back!!!,2,2017,05,23
204,Central Location with Quiet Rooms and Good Service,"Located off St Stephen's Green in the heart of the city, the Fitzwilliam offers lovely quiet rooms with all amenities including free WiFi. The beds are comfortable, the lighting excellent, the bathrooms big and modern, and the service very good. Breakfast was excellent as well, with a wide variety in the cold buffet plus many options for a cooked breakfast. This came with the room and if you are hungry in the morning it is a great benefit. We only stayed one night but everything was well handled at check in and check out. The bell captain was cordial and gave excellent directions. I would return for a longer period next time.",4,2017,05,22
204,Excellent location,"The location is excellent.  Well within walking distance of many attractions, dining, and shopping.
Staff was attentive and friendly.
Rooms are modern and cozy.  The bathrooms are quite spacious relative to room size.
The food was a bit disappointing but there are so many great options nearby.",4,2017,05,22
204,Excellent Hotel - highly recommend anyone staying,"Took my wife to Dublin as a birthday surprise - the hotel staff made our weekend away very enjoyable and really looked after ours.  I would recommend anyone to stay there, great value for money, great location, great staff!!!",5,2017,05,22
204,Absolutely fantastic!,"Where to begin? From the moment we arrived at the front desk to the moment we left, our stay was spectacular. The staff couldn't have been nicer, everyone greeted us with big friendly smiles. Our room was spotlessly clean and we had a fantastic view of St. Stephens Green. As my partner and I were celebrating our 10 year anniversary, we had a small fruit plate with cakes delivered to our room courtesy of the hotel and a hand written note from the general manager. Such a small gesture from the hotel really made a difference in our stay.
I will most definitely be staying here again",5,2017,05,22
204,Short Dublin City Visit,"The Fitzwilliam was wonderful.  Lovely room, overlooking the park.  Extremely convenient to everything.  Front desk staff, concierge staff - all very welcoming and accommodating.  They did everything they could to make our short staff pleasant.",5,2017,05,21
204,Its not the merrion,Fitzwilliam is a fairly nice hotel and the staff is very pleasant and helpful. However I found them to be very very insincere when it came to assisting early arrivals. My flight landed at 5:30am and I was at the hotel by 7am. They claimed the hotel was full the night before so I should go have breakfast while I wait for a room to empty. As a I peered down from dining room a procession of business people were checking out all morning. I was told I was the first person on the wait list to get a room when it becomes available. It was clear they did not want to let me check in early without having paid for the previous night ....I eventually settled for a smaller room just to be able to lay down...my issue is don't pretend to be a 5 star hotel without doing your best to make your guests comfortable.....the merrion is a far superior hotel,4,2017,05,19
204,The very best hotel experiance in Dublin,The Fitzwilliam hotel met our expectations and we had a wonderful stay. Room 504 was fantastic with a view of the Park and a patio to enjoy breakfast or lunch. The staff was fantastic and took care of transportation and restaurant selections. The hotel is located within walking distance to all the major sights of Dublin. Cannot wait to return.,5,2017,05,18
204,Excellent Value and Great Location,"Convenient to city center destinations.  Very friendly and attentive staff. Rooms were small but well appointed.  A couple power outlets in the room didn't work, but that was the only flaw I experienced.",5,2017,05,18
204,Lovely hotel in Dublin,"Should you want to have a fantastic experience with great staff and services as well as with good food, go for it! the hotel is charming and lovely, with a real welcoming feeling.

204,Comfort and Quality,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin on a Saturday night earlier this month. I have to say that all our experiences here were exceptional. From the moment the checked in till the moment we checked out everything was perfect. Fabulously comfortable bed and Breakfast Buffet as good as we've ever had. Each and every member of the staff and management was so pleasant and eager to please. The policy at this Hotel is obviously ' Our Customer is our first and foremost priority'
Well done to one and all. We are looking to our return visit in the near future",5,2017,05,17
204,Needs some spiffing up!,"Great location. Staff was congenial and very helpful.

204,Great Hotel,"Wonderful Hotel in a fantastic location.  The room was a little dated, but very clean and cheerful.  The parking is accessed from the rear and a little hard to find.  The concierge staff is top notch and can help make your trip memorable.",5,2017,05,17
204,Amazing hotel with top class staff,"So glad we stayed a this hotel. The room was nice and spacious with a modern look. the rooms had built in air con which was a huge plus. Breakfast area was small but the selection was good and staff were super efficient. The staff were the best we have encountered on our travels. After arriving at the hotel early we were surprised to find our room was ready in minutes. Checkin was quick and the girl on the desk was very friendly. we were introduced to Alan who showed us to our room and was very helpful. he even helped us to connect our cell phones after they failed to work. this amazing welcome made us feel like VIPs! even stopped by the concierge counter to get us maps and adaptors everything we needed for our stay, excellent 5 star service. Would highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Dublin. Thank you to all the staff for making our trip so wonderful",5,2017,05,16

Will always use this hotel when in Dublin",5,2017,05,14
204,Centrally located hotel,"Hotel is centrally located. The tram is just in front of the hotel and shopping area is just beside the hotel. Rooms are a bit small but has a nice view of the city. The rooms even have a wall mounted air-con if it gets too warm. 

The breakfast area is small and busy during peak breakfast times, that's when the service goes down. The buffet section is for the cold breakfast, while the hot breakfast is ordered from a menu.",4,2017,05,11
204,Excellent hotel,"Hotel was excellent  staff very friendly , welcoming and  helpful. Location was good , central and within walking distance of everything. Room clean and spacious.  Breakfast was very good and lots of choices. ",5,2017,05,10
204,Jewel in the crown of Dublin!,"The Fitzwilliam hotel is fabulous for central location, friendly atmosphere & excellent service.

We had a couple of excellent restaurant recommendation's and they helped with travel & sightseeing. Would highly recommend this hotel when visiting Dublin.",5,2017,05,09
204,Colorful eloquent Hotel,I loved the decor of the Hotel. It was very eye appealing and the colors made me happy to be in the hotel.  The location was great also! Close to everything that center Dublin has to offer! It was alittle pricey but still would highly recommend this Hotel! Hospitality was very nice too!,5,2017,05,09

Great location and staff. Breakfast very good. Love the smoothies. Have not eaten in restaurants. Staff always very friendly and helpful.
Will stay again.",5,2017,05,09
204,Stay at Fitzwilliam,Fantastic hotel in a prime location.  I found the corridors a little dark but in hindsight this contributed towards the ambience of the décor.  Very traditional but trendy and the rooms are spacious enough to manoeuvre around with an attractive colour scheme.  I wanted to take the purple quilted headboard home but don't think that would have gone down too well :-) headboards ,5,2017,05,08
204,Great location in Dublin. Good Services.,"Extremely well located hotel, Right in front of St Stephen's Green and walking distance to almost all atractions. The rooms are nice and confortable and the staff is very helpfull. Breakfast is wonderfull with lots of choices and great quality. The bar is also good but lacks a touch of Irish charm. The TV sets are placed a little too low to confortably watch from the bed.",4,2017,05,08
204,Little disappointed,"The staff are extremely professional and friendly. 
Location is excellent for shopping, Theatre and bars.
The food experience however was very disappointing. Lamb was raw in the centre and side dishes arrived cold.",3,2017,05,08
204,RELAXING,"Stayed in the fitzwilliam for 2 nights . on arrival our car was taken and parked for us that was a good start . When we booked we had requested a room with balcony but when we were shown to our room it was beautiful but the balcony was on ground level and you were facing into a court yard were other guests were looking out from their windows into your balcony . So I requested a change of room and I wasn't disappointed . We were looking over st Stephens green where you could just people watch all day . There are loads of shops, bars and restaurants . The food in the hotel was first class and the bar staff were very polite and nothing was too much bother . Breakfast was amazing , lots of lovely fresh food and most of all a nice cup of tea !!! 

I would definitely recommend this hotel , you won't be disappointed .  I hope to return soon .",5,2017,05,07
204,Here again for my business trip in Dublin,"Excellent hotel in the center of Dublin.  Very nice rooms, cosy hôtel. This time I had a nice room with view over the park and on top was a sunny day. The pedestrian area is walking distance with a lot of shops and restaurants. Just in front you find a beautiful park. Taxi from Airport around 30 min and 27 Euro. You also have the tram stop in front of the hotel. ",5,2017,05,07
204,"Location, rooms and service all very good at The Fitzwilliam","I've stayed here a couple of times for work and overall like this hotel very much. The location is very good, as the hotel is within feet of numerous restaurants, shops and bars. If anything, the area is a bit touristy - it's that convenient and attraction-rich. St. Stephen's Green across the street is a picturesque little park for a stroll; just note the relatively short hours of 8am-8pm. My favorite thing about this hotel is the rooms. The decor is very visually-pleasing with a lot of dark wood and vibrant, stylish textiles; they are extremely comfortable and welcoming. 

There are three things about this hotel that I'd love to see improved (in order of priority) and would earn a 5-star review from me: 1) The gym: Honestly, why bother having a gym if it is going to be this small, with very little ventilation? One treadmill, one elliptical machine (that was broken) and one recumbent stationery bike, along with a weight bench and some weights - all packed into what I assume was once a storage room? There were three people in the gym when I visited it, and it was way too close for comfort. Nice that towels and water are offered, but seriously - expand the gym and bring it up to the level of the rest of the hotel. 2) The breakfast: I was disappointed to find that the breakfast buffet included with the room was only cold items. Eggs, breakfast meats, etc were all made-to-order - which is not particularly convenient if you are in a hurry. On my first stay at The Fitzwilliam, scrambled eggs and breakfast meats were part of the buffet, and it was a delight. Please bring this back! 3) Bathrooms: Now we are getting down to the very picky stuff, because the fixtures and tub/shower in the rooms are great, but there is not enough counter space in these bathrooms, the lighting in the bathroom is far too dim, you can't dry your hair in the bathroom due to lack of outlets, and there is no towel bar to hang a hand towel. Certainly not going to ruin your stay, but it does make it less convenient. 

Again, fixing all of these things would make the experience truly great - and really these are my only constructive criticisms for a really lovely hotel.",4,2017,05,06
204,Perfect location,"perfectly situated to explore the city, close to excellent restaurants and coffee shops, walking distance to Vicar Street music venue, shopping, galleries etc... 
staff are friendly and knowledgeable

204,Mayday in fitzwilliam dublin,Beautiful hotel and excellent friendly staff.. food was excellent..high floors with balcony best.the location is perfect for shopping sightseeing and so close to the bars and resteraunts... carparking on sight is also a great asset.,5,2017,05,02
204,Excellent in all aspects,"At an excellent location, with excellent professional and friendly and always smiling staff, very comfortable and clean rooms, delicious breakfast and food, Fitzwilliam is our hotel of choice for all our stays in Dublin.",5,2017,05,02
204,Dublin weekend,"Great hotel. Friendly staff and ideal location for seeing the sights. Breakfast was very good, as was the food in the restaurant. Would recommend strongly to anyone visiting the city. We plan to return in the near future.",5,2017,05,02
204,Boutique hotel,"Friendly staff, nice size room, decent restaurant.  Overall joyed 3 night stay...only downside -- pricey for what you get.  Good location, easy access, fabulous concierge staff that was very helpful.  We enjoyed... ",4,2017,05,02
204,good location,"location , location, location is what this place has
so close to great shopping 
suggested a good place to go for irish music and dancing plus food
great amenities in room and complimentary water in mini bar",4,2017,05,01
204,Excellent,"I had no idea how nice of a place this was beforehand and booked it mainly because a colleague was staying there at the same time while I was going there on business. I was blown away by how nice the place was, seeing how I usually am in budget hotels when traveling! Felt like a king for a week.",5,2017,04,30
204,3.5 stars more like it,"Spent 3 nights.  They gave me a room upon my early arrive from JFK which was great! Room itself was noisy. I could hear sinks and toilets in use next door. Small TV, I don't really care but someone else mentioned it on TripAdvisor, I agree. 
The bar and restaurant ate not particularly interesting or inviting. Both are somewhat sterile, not much character. 
In contrast, the Westbury has much more inviting public areas. FAR more atmosphere.  I did not sleep at the Westbury but have dined there several times.
The staff at the Fitzwilliam was great. Location is great. But actual rooms and public areas were nothing exceptional to give this more than 3.5 stars.",3,2017,04,29
204,Thanks,"We had a great time and very much appreciated all the effort the staff took to ensure that our trip was pleasant . From check in to check out it was great. We found our room clean and comfortable, quiet and always ready when we came back from our travels .",5,2017,04,29
204,Honeymoon,Our stay at this motel was awesome we could not have asked for better service or friendlier staff. It was nice to be remembered each morning at breakfast. The room we stayed in was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. ,5,2017,04,28
204,Review,"Spent an hour calling room service, reception and the operator and nobody answered. I ended up ordering food from deliveroo. Shocking service for a supposed ""five start"" hotel. Bulbs not working, not enough sockets. Very disappointed with this hotel and not worth the money.",2,2017,04,28
204,Great spot ,"A perfectly situated hotels opposite St Stephen's Green. Minutes away from Grafton Street and a short walk into City, Temple Bar and...restaurants and bars aplenty. 

The bar was great place to stop off for a nightcap with very friendly and helpful staff. 

Wonderful treatments @ the Spa.  I had massage and facial and both were excellent. 

Our room was on the top floor and had fabulous views from the terrace. 

Breakfasts were excellent. In fact our experience was magical and the hotel is thoroughly recommended. ",5,2017,04,28
204,"Nice night, great spot",Grand place to stay. Great front of house. Comfortable beds. A little on the pricey side...but what isn't in Dublin? Our room felt an absolute trek from the lifts! Super location to start your exploring from.,4,2017,04,27
204,Great location and great staff - rooms a bit overrated,"Booked in at last minute following Ryanair flight cancellation and stayed 2 nights. Fabulous staff on reception and very impressed initially. However the rooms are not really 5 star - broken furniture, very small bathrooms, no attention to detail. Were given another room with a balcony but you had to climb up to use it, then a bigger room with a 4 poster bed and a tiny tv you couldn't see. I would make all the senior managers stay in the rooms so they could see the faults -like paintwork, unfished grout etc. when we raised concerns we were told ""Ireland 5 star is not like Dubai 5 star"" - well having experienced both I beg to differ!!
Anyway the staff did try and put things right and threw in a free breakfast ( which should be included at this price!!) and knocked a few quid off the bill after I shared my observations all of which went part way to redeeming the hotel.
We would probably stay again if they had a good deal on. 
A huge thanks to the staff who tried very hard!",3,2017,04,26
204,Great five star hotel ****,"The Fitzwilliam is a Great five star hotel **** We stayed in a beautiful suite, well worth it. Excellent location... friendly staff and it was a very enjoyable trip overall. We will definitely be returning!",5,2017,04,26
204,Great hotel,"Excellent location. Great service and helpful staff, highly reccommended. Close to a lot of attractions.  Very comfortable and clean.  Rooms are small but comfortable and well furnished.  Concierge was a big help!",5,2017,04,25
204,Definitely return customers-great location,"We spent four nights in the Fitzwilliam. Great location, great service and an all round nice place to stay in Dublin. Downstairs bar was relaxing and staff were friendly without being pushy. Breakfasts were excellent. On checking out, doorman showed me that he loaded  all our luggage-nice touch. Definitely return customers.",4,2017,04,23
204,Excellent and friendly hotel,I regularly stay at The Fitzwilliam and it never fails to be a pleasure.  The staff are as friendly as you will find anywhere and are extremely helpful.  The rooms are comfortable and tastefully appointed.  Breakfasts are as large or small as required but always delicious.  I recommend it highly.,5,2017,04,23
204,"Location, Quality and Service","We stayed at this hotel for the last two nights of our recent Ireland vacation.  The location of this hotel was perfect! Right across from Stephen's Green and right at the base of Grafton Street.  This made it easy for us to walk to many of the sites/tours we had planned.  There is currently a lot of road construction going on in Dublin, we did have one taxi who dropped us off a block away because the construction would have meant going on a huge detour to pull up right in front of the hotel, but none of the other taxi's had an issue picking us up/dropping us off right out front.  The room was a great size and so importantly it was so quiet-no noise from the adjoining rooms or hallway.  We had booked with breakfast included, the buffet was nice, but the served food ordered from the menu was excellent.  If I had to pay out of pocket at breakfast it would be a steep price for breakfast so I was glad it was rolled into the room price.  The service was excellent from the front desk staff, the doormen, and the breakfast servers.  I hope we can return to stay here again on a future trip to Dublin, I would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2017,04,22
204,The Fabulous Fitzwilliam,The Fitzwilliam is the only place to stay in Dublin. The location is unsurpassed and the level of service and attentiveness of staff is second to none. The choice available at breakfast is breathtaking and the rooms are luxurious and spacious. My favourite place to stay in Dublin by far.,5,2017,04,21
204,Friendliest service,"If you are looking for a well located property with the friendliest service in Dublin, look no further than the Fitzwilliam.  From the moment you arrive until you check out, the staff will make you feel welcome.  The full Irish breakfast is delicious and the bar is a great place to relax after dinner.  Rooms are updated and clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",5,2017,04,21
204,Excellent experience,Wonderful hotel. Gorgeous room and beautiful food. Very friendly and helpful staff who couldn't do enough for me. I would definitely stay here again. I was sorry I was only staying for 1 night only. I would recommend this hotel. ,5,2017,04,21
204,Kitchen Closed,"I got in late from a meeting.  I was told I could get food at the bar at 9:30.  But the bar tender took so long to make my drink when I ordered food it was 9:45 and I was informed the kitchen was closed. They are a 5 star hotel.  When a guest wants something to eat someone should jump to serve.  However I was offered peanuts.

",2,2017,04,21
204,Nice Friendly Welcoming Hotel,"Spent a long weekend in Dublin with my Mrs and daughter, lovely hotel staff are really helpful.  Room was really good - will definitely be using the Fitzwilliam again when we travel to Dublin during summer",5,2017,04,21
204,Excellent Hotel In Fabulous Location!,If you are looking for a a beautiful hotel in a convenient location then the Fitzwilliam is the right choice. From the moment we arrived the staff accommodated our every need and went above and beyond what we could have expected!  We can't wait for the opportunity to return!,5,2017,04,20
204,In Dublin's Fair City,"Excellent service.  Staff very helpful and attentive.  We didn't have any meals in the hotel other than breakfast, which was excellent.  Location was great... just a minute away from Grafton Street shops.",5,2017,04,20
204,Made a special stay extra-special,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were treated to excellent, caring and efficient service from all the staff at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  A very comfortable and clean room provided a perfect base for the sights and sounds of Dublin. Can't thank the staff emough for making a special stay extra-special.",5,2017,04,19
204,Our Dublin stay,Great Hotel in a great location near Grafton street. Highly recommended. Great staff and friendly. Would definitely go back next time we are in Dublin. And the price point was much better than some of the other high end hotels in the area,5,2017,04,17
204,Best hotel experience we've ever had!,"Top-notch staff and service. Rooms are modern and beautiful. Request one with a view of Stephen's Green! Concierge was helpful in finding our way around and getting some hard-to-get dinner reservations. Everything is easily accessible from this location, just adjacent to shopping at Grafton Street and a few blocks from beautiful Trinity College. The attention to detail made our stay comfortable; my husband loved the nightly chocolates with turndown service.",5,2017,04,17
204,Poor service,"This hotel failed to provide even adequate, 2 star customer service.  The concierge on both occasions failed to return a message to questions we had concerning dinner reservations.  Front staff stated that we had paid for breakfast, however dining room staff had no record of this and stated we would have to pay 23 euros for breakfast.  Issue was never resolved and we were ignored in the dining area.  Management need to focus on customer service.  I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2017,04,17
204,"Great Central Location, Awesome Staff","Great place, right in the middle of everything. Staff is very friendly and the rooms are modern and clean. Completely worth the stay. They were very prompt in helping us out whenever we had any issues at all, but there weren't many to have :)",5,2017,04,16
204,Wonderful stay,"Our stay was short and sweet but we were amazed with the pleasantness and efficiency of the staff.  The location was great as was the wifi.   The rooms were fairly standard and clean. .......

204,"Nice Hotel, great location.","Great Dublin hotel, perfect location if you work anywhere near the Green.  

Service - good, but I would rate it a step behind the other top Dublin Hotels (Marion, Shelbourne, Marker).  I had to arrive a day later than anticipated due to flight problems, and I called ahead to make sure they didn't cancel my reservation.  They canceled it anyway after telling me they wouldn't.  They got me a room anyway, but it was a bit alarming. 

Room - pretty standard room, clean and neat, housekeeping was great. 

Location - right on the green which was great for me

Restaurant/Bar, good for a quick meal or a drink

All in all a good hotel and experience.",5,2017,04,14
204,Fitzwilliam in Dublin,"Very clean and modern-looking rooms. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Lots of construction going on in city right now, so if you are driving yourselves around it will make things difficult. If you're good walking, there's plenty of sights within 5 to 30 minutes, otherwise, taxis and buses are available o'plenty. ",5,2017,04,14
204,Great location,Good location and easy access for all tourist attractions. Staff pleasant and seemed extremely helpful when guests wanted advice about where to go and how best to get there. I was there on business so didn't visit any attractions this time but the amenities at the hotel were suited to a single guest.it was easy to eat in the hotel bar area of an evening comfortably.,4,2017,04,14
204,Excellent Facility and Service,Highly recommend hotel and staff.  Flawless stay.  Excellent location no matter the reason for your stay in Dublin and timely responses by staff to requests for items and information.  Excellent bedding and bathroom furnishings too.,5,2017,04,13
204,Good location. Great staff.,"Second trip back to the Fitzwilliam.  Great central location near Dublin shopping, attractions and pubs.  The front desk staff and concierge staff are excellent.  One gentleman even remembered our conversation from over 2 years ago.  Rooms are quiet. Would definitely return again.",4,2017,04,13
204,Great Location-Helpful Friendly Staff,"Lovely hotel in the best location.
We had a wonderful 5 night stay--the room was lovely, the staff friendly and helpful, and the breakfast plentiful and delicious. We arrived from the USA at 8 AM and had a lovely breakfast and our room was ready!!
Highly recommend this hotel-",5,2017,04,12
204,Absolutly fantastic hotel,This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in & the staff are fantastic. They look after everything for you. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to family & friends. The rooms are great & the food was good too.  Wfi was great.,5,2017,04,12
204,Birthday treat,"By John April 11th 2017.
We took my sister and her husband to Dublin for a birthday treat. The hotel was excellent - a great location in the heart of the city. Classy without being too formal, and all the staff were friendly.",5,2017,04,11
204,Good position,Picked this hotel as it was central and one of us is not good on his feet. The hotel is clean and amazingly quiet on a night. The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially front of house staff. The Polish waitress at breakfast was lovely. A couple of faults that slightly bothered me. We waited over 30 minutes in the bar for two Irish coffees and when they arrived they were barely warm and everyone else had finished their drinks. At breakfast I'm afraid the quality of the toast is not 5* and on the second morning I cut the rustic bread and they kindly toasted that and it was great. Otherwise a nice hotel,4,2017,04,11
204,Good location,This is a nice hotel in a good location. The staff are very helpful & polite.  The basic rooms are small and ours was a little tired in need of redecorating. We did not try the food. There are plenty of cafes in walking distance where you can get a decent breakfast for around 20 euro for two people.,4,2017,04,11
204,Wonderful welcome,"Staff were fantastic. We hope to return. A lovely welcome and very accommodating team. Location is brilliant for access to Grafton Street, Temple Bar and Baggot St. A lovely place to stay after a long flight",5,2017,04,11
204,A stay at the Fitzwilliam,"We love the staff at this hotel, they are friendly and knowledgable. We did have an issue with the air conditioning (it was a hot weekend) that remained until we left. I would point out that this was most likely a mechanical issue; I bring it up because I feel they should be aware.",4,2017,04,10
204,"Great location, great hotel and service","The hotel is in a great location, easy to walk to great restaurants, shopping, train, pubs and park.. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is very good.  We had 14 family members (in 7 rooms) come together to celebrate a special birthday. There is a cozy lobby with an open fireplace where we gathered  before setting out for our day.  The staff was very accommodating and professional.   One of us had a  problem with the hot water is our room.  The manager, named Will, resolved the issue immediately and compensated us for our inconvenience.  We were all very impressed with the hotel and the service.  We would definitely stay there again when we are in Dublin.",5,2017,04,10
204,Dublin Weekend,"Very pleasant. Room upgrade included terrace overlooking St Stephen's Green.
Room service for coffee on the terrace watching the sun rise over the city.

Otherwise as expected from a 5 star city centre hotel",5,2017,04,10
204,Best Business Hotel in Dublin,"Excellent location with great staff and well appointed rooms. The views from the rooms facing the park are charming.Quick to and from the airport. Good internet.
The bar is good especially on busy nights such as Friday - not too crowded.",5,2017,04,09
204,A Bit Too Purple,Perfect location for Dublin tourists overlooking St Stephens Green. The staff are amazingly helpful and friendly. The predominantly purple interior needs attention and revitalization. Just too dark and overpoweringly purple for me.,4,2017,04,08
204,"Dublin Fitzwilliam - Great location, very modern","After staying at the Fitzwiliam in Belfast, I had a certain expectation for the Fitzwiliam in Dublin.  My expectations were pleasantly exceeded!

The rooms are small, but very well appointed, clean and quiet.  Unlike the Fitzwilliam in Belfast, the quality of materials and craftsmanship exhibited in the rooms was very high quality.

I had a small balcony overlooking the interior courtyard (which was really nice!).  This was an unexpected perk.

The location for this hotel is great - within walking distance of Grafton and King Sts - a mecca for shopping.

I was traveling on business with 3 others - all of us had positive things to say about our rooms and our stay.  I'll definitely stay again when next in Dublin.",5,2017,04,08
204,Don't miss out on staying at The Fitzwilliam!,"This splendid high end hotel offers a boutique like feeling with endless personal touches. 
Perfect location, great generous breakfasts, and unbelievable staff. 
Highly recommend. 
We will be back for sure. ",5,2017,04,08
204,Good location & price but tiny rooms,"Good hotel but rooms are TINY and some are very far from the lobby. Gym is basically a closet with a treadmill. The staff generally speaking--especially the concierge--are very friendly. But the front desk staff was hit or miss. When I arrived (after my 7 hour overnight flight), they insisted that they didn't have my reservation and demanded to see proof of the reservation. After I showed the email confirmation, they didn't even apologize or offer to make up their huge mistake in any way (i.e. like by upgrading me). They seemed unfazed to have acted like I didn't have a reservation. ",3,2017,04,08
204,Great location,"Perfect location for tourists to Dublin. The room was lovely and the bed was exquisite. The food was 5-star...fresh, delicious, beautifully presented. But as other reviewers have stated, the staff make the visit unforgettable;  they were attentive to our every need. We would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.
",5,2017,04,07
204,Date night away from family,"Booked online prior to travelling to Ireland. Purchased the full package of dinner and breakfast and room in dlx.room. Easy and friendly check-in and room ready when we arrived. High floor overlooking St. Stephens Green with balcony. Room quite small and deff. in need of updating and furniture/paint touch-ups. Wifi good, a/c worked well, bathroom amenities plentiful, shower/bathtub combo, desk-top a little cluttered with all sorts of marketing and hotel info. Comp. bottles of mineral water and amenity available. Dinner was fine. Not busy at all but long delay with main course to arrive, Friendly staff member and manager and food was good. Breakfast in morning a bit of a disaster. We arrived at 10am and cold buffet station was in disarray as room was quite busy. Nobody really observant of this throughout meal. Hot food was ordered ala carte. It was again fine. Staff working hard to keep up but deff. friendly and helpful. Check-out was brief but noticed little add-ons such as cappuccino for dinner and charge for morning newspaper. Nothing underhand just gives the sense that not operating at luxury level. Location perfect for anybody visiting Dublin from afar. Room was quiet despite facing the main drag so to speak. For the price i just expected a little more refinement and room product to be more pristine and updated.",3,2017,04,06
204,Another Amazing Stay,"The Fitzwilliam is absolutely amazing, central location, lovely food in both the restaurant and bar, breakfast is superb. The rooms are furnished impeccably and the beds are like sleeping on clouds. While these are all great attributes it is the staff that make this hotel the 5* establishment that it is. I cannot praise them enough, you really feel genuinely welcome and having stayed here a few times, it feels like being greeted by family. Every need is looked after and nothing is too much bother. Special mention must go to Marisol and Ivona on the Front Desk, Grant the concierge, Aaron in the bar and Alissandra in the restaurant.",5,2017,04,06
204,Very Disappointing experience,"Having stayed in most of Dublins 5* hotels this is by far the least impressive on all accounts. We stayed in one of the hotels best rooms with a deluxe premium room overlooking st green and other than fabulous views from balcony the room itself was inadequate. It was too small, very outdated and in need of modernisation especially bathroom where shower head was almost hanging from wall. We got one bottle of water in our room for the duration of 2 day stay. I was promised a special VIP welcome amenity as part of my booking and a got a small plate of fruit left in room and a card from general manager on second day with my surname incorrectly spelt! The balcony had not been property cleaned as it was littered with dozens of cigarette butts! Check in was a calamity and I'll agree I may not have helped as wanted to pay for stay with a mixture of sterling and euro. I was promised an itemised bill to show how this was converted as there is no way the amounts I have could have exactly equalled my bill! This was never produced nor was the promised phone call to let me know when room was ready to check in which I finally discovered was ready after calling back into hotel at almost 2pm! Breakfast was very poor and shocking from a 5* hotel! I think you need to look at making cooked breakfast buffet because having it cooked to order certainly didn't improve any element of it! I went for cooked irish breakfast both days and at best it was ok - scrambled egg bit too congealed and flavourless! However my wife's experience was simply shocking! On first day she ordered pancakes for which a small folded crepe arrived which was inedible. The next day she decided to go for the waffles and what was presented was most bizarre waffle I've ever laid eyes on! it was basically pancake pressed with waffle maker shapes and cut into 4! Again not eaten! The only redeeming feature of that hotel is its location as it falls short by some distance on luxury and service! Unfortunately I wouldn't return again as there are far better options in Dublin if you want luxury and service with The Marker being a shining example of both! ",1,2017,04,03
204,Brilliant hotel with great srvice,"We had a great two night stay at the Fitzwilliam. There were 6 of us, two kids, two grandparents and us. Check in was seamless, the staff were very pleasant and helpful, the rooms very comfortable with excellent wifi. The bar was good with interesting cocktails and breakfast was very well done with a lot of choice. 

My only complaint was the very loud air conditioning in the rooms. We turned it off and left the windows open instead. 

Very central and surrounded by some great restaurants and the shopping is right on your doorstep. 

Would thoroughly recommend. ",4,2017,04,03
204,Disappointed on returning,"Myself and husband stayed at the hotel for two nights in one of the deluxe premium rooms overlooking St. Stephens green. Whilst the views are outstanding there are simple requirements of a premium room which are neglected. The room itself is small, the bathroom outdated shower didn't work, sound system in the bathroom didn't work, water not replaced as specified, no glasses to enjoy the mini bar goodies and the turn down service basically means a chocolate on your pillow! We have stayed in most of the 5* hotels in Dublin and this has been the worst for the little extras, customer service and basic room requirements. As I said at the start fab balcony but on a rainy day (which is often in Dublin) the room itself does not fit the expensive bill you will have on departure. Breakfast was disappointing with me sending back pancakes (which I never do) and my husband disappointed with his full Irish fry. Location is superb but I would definitely recommend other 5* hotels nearby",2,2017,04,01
204,Lovely stay," This hotel is really really good. It's in a great location, right near Grafton st. And across from St. Stephens Green. 

Top notch list: 
Wi-Fi
Staff
Food
Cleanliness

Their breakfast in the mezzanine is absolutely delicious. The staff was super helpful and knowledgeable. ",4,2017,04,01
204,Superb service and great location,"The Fitzwilliam understands what great service is all about. Each member of the staff was exceptional in responding to my requests. My room was well-appointed, clean, comfortable, and overlooked the garden. The hotel is well located on St. Stephen's Green and is within walking distance of many of Dublin's best shops. Recommend without reservation.",5,2017,03,31
204,Gem of a hotel where details matter,"The staff at the hotel were all terrific.  Patrick made us dinner reservations and we loved all 4 places he selected.  The ""to go"" breakfast was perfect for our day trip to see the Cliffs of Moher.  Little things like opening the hotel doors when you arrive makes you feel at home.  Breakfast was delicious - great selection.",5,2017,03,29
204,Very Pleasant Stay,Stayed for one night on a business trip. Hotel is in a great location. Rooms are on the small side but beautifully finished. Staff are very courteous and professional. All in all a very pleasant experience.,4,2017,03,29
204,Would rate this higher than 5 stars,What a pleasant surprise staying at the Fitz William.  The experience and attention from beginning to end was beyond 5 stars.  In fact our experience began with the doorman straight through to reception and concierge. You can tell there is a sense of pride and care in what they do for their customers and it shows.  It is what hospitality should be and somehow has been lost.  All 5 star hotels should take a page out of their books! Truly a pleasure and a warm thank you for making our short stay very memorable!  Thank you!,5,2017,03,28
204,Look no further,"For travel in Dublin, look no further.  The location is prime, the staff is friendly, and if you need anything (power converters, toiletry kits, umbrella's, etc), they will provide. Ex: When I arrived on Sunday morning they helped me plan my day touring Dublin - above and beyond",5,2017,03,28
204,Great stay and experience,"The friendliest staff I've seen in a while, great spacious rooms at a fantastic and beautiful location, with tasty and good breakfast. The concierge was so amazing and fantastic, such kind people. The hotel is walking distance from everything in Dublin, and was a great hotel all together.",5,2017,03,28
204,Very good hotel in Dublin,"My wife and i just returned from a three night stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel and have every praise for it. Firstly, the situation is absolutely perfect for enjoying Dublin. It is directly opposite St Stephens' Park which is outstanding for its flower displays and walking around. Within minutes walk of the front door are many shops and restaurants and pubs. From the minute we arrived to the time we departed the staff were so attentive and helpful. They all went the extra mile so to speak, whenever we had query. The room was perfect in every way.",5,2017,03,27
204,Oozes Class,"Stayed here for Saturday night for match.
Pros: Classy. Location. Staff and Food
Cons: Car park - The Hotel should seriously consider stopping providing a car park for non residents to the detriment of residents!!
We stayed on level 6 .Nicely appointed room not modern by any means. Lift access not really a problem.
Overall a great stay. You just cannot ignore the class that seeps through it 
 ",5,2017,03,27
204,"Shopping bag missing, room overheated, wrong directions to airlink","Disappointed:  room was too hot, my shopping bag went missing, and Martin directed us to air coach when I asked for airlink.  We ended up missing our flight by the time we found the correct bus stop. My bag must have been mistaken for rubbish but I lost my gifts.",3,2017,03,27
204,Fitzwilliam hotel,"Great staff, great rooms, great location. Could not have been better from check in right through to check out. Best place that I have stayed in Dublin City, walking distance to all the city's hotspots. ",5,2017,03,26
204,Great location and wonderful service,"Had a great stay at this hotel. Well within walking distance of all of Dublin's attractions and the staff was great. Super helpful, they really bent over backwards to help for the most minor things. We were treated so well here.  ",5,2017,03,26
204,Very pleasant stay in Dublin," We mixed a little business and pleasure.
Great location that was walkable to everything we needed and wanted to do. 
The staff was super helpful and kind. 
We even had warmer weather than expected which made walking on the green across the street most pleasant  ",4,2017,03,26
204,Wonderful Stay Beside St. Stephen's Green!,"I stayed for my 25th birthday in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin and I had the loveliest time. The staff are all top class- in particular Silvia (who delivered an amenity to my room for my birthday) and Kevin and Victoria (who looked after us at breakfast). The room was absolutely beautiful with a balcony that overlooked St. Stephen's Green and we even got a bit of sunshine before checkout so we enjoyed room service lunch al fresco! The bathroom in the room was one of the nicest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen- Fitzwilliam embroidered bathrobes and towels, a massive bathtub and a handy magnifying mirror to do your make up. Breakfast was, again, one of the best I've ever seen with plenty to choose from on the continental buffet and lots of delicious choices on the hot food menu. The complimentary Irish Independent to the room was a lovely touch and I also asked for late checkout and enjoyed an extended stay until 2pm. If you're looking for a little bit of luxury while staying in Dublin, I would certainly recommend the Fitzwilliam.",5,2017,03,25
204,Excellent Dublin Experience,I spent my first nights in Dublin at Fitzwilliam Hotel and the staff were extremely nice and friendly. Everyone seemed interested in helping and making my stay be as easy as possible. The location of the hotel is also amazing being so close to Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green.  ,5,2017,03,25
204,"Great location, and staff","While having a small sample size of 2 stays, these guys are batting 1.000! The staff is extremely friendly and attentive to your needs, very personable yet professional at the same time, and timely in everything they do. They gained a fan and each time I'm in Dublin for future business or personal travel, I hope to have the chance to stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel!",5,2017,03,24
204,Great Hotel ideal location,Close to lots of places to eat and bars.  Easy walk to bus stop.  Rooms were clean and very nice.  Breakfast was included and was really good.  The shower had amazing water pressure!!!Overall it was a great place to stay,5,2017,03,24
204,Great stay,"First time in Dublin, great hotel. We booked with Costco travel and I wanted to make sure the location was central. It was, plus the beds were comfortable, the people were helpful and the breakfast was outstanding! ",5,2017,03,23
204,Wonderful Welcome to Ireland,The staff at the FitzWilliam were extremely helpful and accommodating. The hotel's location right across from St. Stephens Green and adjacent to Grafton Street is ideal. We were able to walk to all of our destinations in Dublin. Like most hotel's located in cities the room was fairly small but tastefully decorated.,4,2017,03,22
204,Great hotel in great location,"Best location in Dublin!  All the staff took customer service to a new level - super friendly, helpful and efficient . Room fairly small but well equipped, great shower. Really nice atmosphere.  Didn't sample any restaurants, only breakfast but that was superb!",5,2017,03,22
204,The Gilbert's visit Dublin,"Wonderful hotel in a great location with the most friendly, relaxed yet attentive staff that reflect the positive welcoming vibe of Dublin.  A city more welcoming will be hard to find. Even the Buskers are great!",5,2017,03,21
204,Not a five star hotel,"I would love to give this hotel a positive review but sadly I cannot. This is not a five star hotel. Location is very good. The staff are friendly. After that I have to say that the overall impression of the hotel is one that shouts ""refurbishment needed"". It tries to be boutique, it isn't. It tries to be minimalist - mmmmn. The rooms have everything you need but the bathrooms need updating, the silicone around the bath has been removed and patched up. It was clean, the balconies overlooking the green are sweet but public areas were not kept clean. When I mentioned this I was just told some chairs had been delivered. That's fine but get the staff to clean up after the delivery!",3,2017,03,21
204,What a fantastic hotel!,"From check-in to check-out the FitzWilliam is a perfect combination of property, location, staff and service. Highly recommended for a great stay in a great city - the balcony room facing the park was great!",5,2017,03,20
204,First time in Dublin,"My wife and I were looking for a hotel in close proximity to city center for easy access to the sights. The Fitzwilliam was an excellent choice for us and we loved the comfort, quality and convenience. The hotel staff were superb!",5,2017,03,20
204,Fantastic Hotel,"Very well situated and staff very polite and well presented.
The bar and restaurant were exceptional, we had an evening meal which the service was excellent and the food was lovely.
The breakfast was fantastic and very well presented.
All staff were very clean and well presented at all time.
The rooms were lovely and clean.
The location of the hotel is excellent and near all the pubs shops that you would need",5,2017,03,20
204,Some staff let it down,Overall we liked staying here but some of the door staff were miserable and ruined the overall ambiance. Room cold and I could not get another duvet. Restaurant manager was excellent. Location excellent. ,3,2017,03,20
204,Great Stay in Dubin,"Brilliant Hotel.  Great Location, great rooms but the staff were excellent.  The concierge team couldn't have been more helpful. Food was excellent it the bar and for breakfast.  I would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Dublin.",5,2017,03,20
204,Great location,Fantastic place to explore the city from and very helpful staff. Nice extras and personal touches but a very small room and badly laid out. Shower into bath which was hard to get in and out of and broken toilet seat.,4,2017,03,20
204,Quite disappointing visit,"We were expecting a 5 star visit for our 3 night stay.
The hotel room was on the front overlooking St Stephens Green.
It was very warm and dated.
The bathroom was quite average.
The bed was quite small and the chairs were uncomfortable.
One of the best features was the balcony which was accessed by climbing up a moveable step then clambouring through the window.
But it rained most of the time.
So we did not get the benefit.In the summer this would be delightful.
Our breakfast experience was poor.
The fried eggs were like rubber and the bacon was not just well done ,t was burnt.
The breakfast selection was not of the expected standard.
Service was poor.
The tea and coffee was cold.
This was the day before St Patrick's day.
Service was worse on St Patrick's day although we opted for boiled eggs and toast...another bad decision.The soft boiled eggs were just runny!
So on our final day we just decided to skip breakfast altogether.We had even pre paid for this breakfast 
Probably one of the worst 5 star hotels we have stayed in
The concierge also forgot to book the nearby steak restaurant.No message was left for his collegue who took over when he finished his shift.We missed this restaurant,which was a disappointment.
£1500 for a very poor visit.,is not value for money ,even though the reception staff were very good and friendly.
The location is excellent,but the standards did not match the premium cost.",3,2017,03,19
204,A very warm Dublin welcome ,"We normally stay at the Intercontinental in Ballsbridge when we travel to Dublin but due to rugby it was fully booked so our agent suggested here instead.  Location wise it is just perfect. You are right in the centre next to the shopping streets and some decent restaurants and pubs  (Peploe's for food and Davy Byrnes for the black stuff well worth a go).

Check in was quite excellent.  Very friendly and efficient reception and door staff.  Concierge very helpful and knowledgable. Room also excellent- we were on 4th floor and had a small balcony with chairs which was nice to get some fresh air.  Other reviews mention it is warm in the rooms.  This is very true but the air con works well and we had the window open for a bit. 

Bed one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and we had 3 nights excellent rest.  Bath also lovely and deep.  

So why not five stars when it all so wonderful.  Well, I have to be fair to other 5 star properties we have stayed in recently.  The Fitzwilliam is starting to look a bit battered in the rooms, service in the bar slow, our water wasn't refilled daily and the breakfast (my hotel barometer) was a 3/5. Very average food quality and this needs to be brought up to scratch.  At €454 euros a night I expect a decent brekkie! If I could give it 4.5 stars I would.  

That said and done, we will certainly return here.  The location, comfort and friendliness of staff outweigh the small niggles.  

Thank you to all the staff. We will be back. (If you'll have us 🤔) ",4,2017,03,19
204,Great time during the St. Patrick's celebration,We can't say enough about the outstanding staff at the Fitzwilliam. They are incredibly helpful. The rooms are very nice and the overall property is fantastic. Very good bar and restaurant with excellent food.,5,2017,03,19
204,Very nice rooms and helpful staf,"The room was just great! A nice terrace, great bed, good bathroom. The staff is also very friendly but during the breakfast a bit too much... Maybe that's just me.  All my issues where solved in minutes (forgot toot brush)! There is also free high speed wi-fi, that's pretty good during business travel!  The airco in my room was a bit noisy and after stopping for minutes it came back on. but for the rest, great value!",4,2017,03,17
204,Best in Dublin,"My husband was booked at this hotel by the organizers of the DotMed conference. We decided to extend the trip and make a family vacation out of it. The hotel itself is stunning. The rooms are very large both by European standards and NYC standards and are very tastefully decorated. The bathrooms are also extremely well equipped. The breakfast choices were extensive and healthy and all of the staff from housekeeping to concierge were friendly and helpful. The location is perfect, you can walk everywhere, restaurants, shopping, theatre, etc. After heading to the coast for a week we were coming back to Dublin for one night again before our flight home. I had previously booked an upscale hotel in the Temple District. I have since cancelled that booking and rebooked with the Fitzwilliam for our final night in Dublin. One piece of advice if you like to sleep with the windows open ask for a room facing the courtyard, not St. Stephen's Green, as it can get noisy in the evenings on the weekends with the windows open.",5,2017,03,16
204,Yeh Dublin,I loved staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  It was in a perfect location on the park.  I was able to walk to wonderful restaurants in the area and always felt safe.  I was traveling for business and was alone.  Staff was super helpful and made our stay wonderful,5,2017,03,15
204,Very disappointing ,"A plus: This hotel is in a great location. The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was good but that was about it. The room that we stayed in was very claustrophobic, extremely warm and in need of some serious TLC. Apart from the fact that the bedroom was small the bathroom was no better. We went to the bar on Sunday night to have a few drinks, it was freezing cold with air conditioning on full there was no way we could stay. We left and walked down towards Grafton Street and went into bar there instead. I've stayed in the Fitzwilliam in Belfast and loved it....a far superior hotel. The Dublin Fitzwilliam is a big let down. ",2,2017,03,13
204,Amazing,"I do not have enough good things to say about my stay here.  My boyfriend and I stayed here for the Dublin Marathon in October.  Great location and easy access to get to the start and back from the finish areas. Very convenient to get around.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  The concierge was very helpful especially since we had very random checkin and leave times. Bar area was great and very friendly as well.

Additionally, I had left some items in the room by accident and not until recently did I have a chance to call and they still had them!!  They were more than helpful and patient on the phone and mailed them back to the US for me.

Top notch and classy establishment - will definitely go back and would recommend to anyone going to dubline",5,2017,03,08
204,The Best Hotel In Dublin!,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is by far the best hotel stay I have ever had. The staff was very professional and polite, and most importantly very friendly. When we arrived in Dublin at 8AM, my mother and I were very tired since we were just coming from an eight hour overnight flight. We wanted to try our luck to see if the hotel could check us in early at 9AM. Upon our arrival to the hotel the staff worked very diligently to help us get checked-in to a room as soon as possible. While we were waiting, the manager Will, greeted us and offered refreshments as well as recommendations on where to go and what to see in the city. This was just one of the many kind gestures of many more kind gestures given by the friendly hotel staff. 

The hotel room was gorgeous and spacious. We had a view to a nice courtyard and a little couch by the window to just sit down and relax. Breakfast was very delicious and I recommend everyone to add it into their stay. The staff was so accommodating that they even brought in a space heater to heat our room faster when we accidentally turned off the heat. 

My mom and I were always greeted with a smile during our stay and if we ever come back to Dublin we will make sure to stay at the Fitzwilliam again. Staying at the Fitzwilliam was very memorable and the highlight of our mother/daughter trip to Europe.",5,2017,03,07
204,THE Hotel to stay in Dublin,"Whether you are here for business or pleasure, The Fitzwilliam will make your Dublin trip that much more enjoyable. The service here was impeccable; from the doorman, to reception, concierge, and service staff every encounter was warm, friendly, and made me feel welcomed.
Bonuses: there is shopping literally around the corner, a beautiful walking park across the street, and it's really walking distance to the quays.",5,2017,03,06
204,"Nice room, central location, but service & food not 5 star","Spent a weekend here in February. While the room was nice and the location was central, the service and food were far below 5 star standard. For example, we dined twice in the bar and each time found the waiting staff to be inattentive and inept. Further, as a Coeliac I found the staff ill-informed and unhelpful and the menu extremely limited. A sandwich for lunch and sea bass for dinner proved unappetising. Certainly not the standard I expected based on reputation, rating and price.",2,2017,03,01
204,Cannot fault it,"Enjoyed a lovely minibreak at this well.maintained hotel.  Our standard room was plenty big enough and spotless.  The both room was very sleek.  The staff were all polite and keen, just what you want really.  We were happy with all the little touches like a good supply of tea in the room and the contolable heating/ air conditioning.  We ate out so cannot comment on the food but I am sure it's good.  The location is perfect and we were able.to walk to most places.",5,2017,02,28
204,"Central location, excellent staff and facilities",This is the second time I have stayed at  this hotel. The staff are super efficient and the location is second to none. To leave the hotel and step directly onto Stephen's Green and Grafton Street is a joy.,5,2017,02,26
204,Wonderful lodging in great location ,"Stayed here on a brief visit to Dublin. Located adjacent to St Stephen's Green near Grafton St and Trinity College. Tickets sold for hop on hop off bus and tourist attractions. 30€ from the airport probably less from the train station. 
Wonderful staff, elegant rooms and great breakfast. Worth the splurge. ",5,2017,02,22
204,"Great Location, Helpful Service","Centrally located on St Stephens Green, half a block from Grafton St.....very friendly, helpful staff, reasonably sized room, adequate bathrooms....breakfast was included and was very nice, only negative was staying on the second floor where our window seat was directly at courtyard level...could;ve been strange except weather kept anyone from being out there......",4,2017,02,21
204,Great Stay,Great value. Great location. Great hotel. I would definitely stay here! Clean rooms and very comfortable beds. Great service as well! Patrick the concierge was really helpful and accommodating. He had great suggestions.  ,5,2017,02,20
204,Fantastic location,"Spent 2 nights with a good friend from America on her first visit to ireland. Although I am from galway, I would not know Dublin as spent many years in America. I need not have worried as from the moment the valet took my car until we left 2 days later we knew it was a good choice. The room and beds were so comfortable. The breakfast had a large choice of fresh fruits and cold and cooked dishes and the afternoon tea was just amazing. The staff were all so helpful and based on their recommendations and booking places for us we got to see all the best sights during the day and in the evenings got to experience great Irish food and a variety of Irish music and great pubs all within a short walk of hotel. They say location is everything and this hotel offered that and so much more. ",5,2017,02,18
204,Home away from home,"Lovely property. But the five stars go to the staff. From the moment I checked in, everyone made me feel like I was at home. Concierges Victor and Travis were shining stars who removed every ounce of stress during my stay. (They also helped me get to the airport on time!) The Fitz is also centrally located, close to businesses, great shopping and famous pins. Without a doubt, this is my home away from home next time I'm in Dublin.  ",5,2017,02,17
204,Faultless!!,"Recently visited for my husbands 40th birthday so wanted something extra special and that's exactly what we got!  Great location, perfect service and beautiful room. Our room was ready upon arrival 5 hours earlier than our check in time and the staff couldn't do enough for us.  Close to shopping and bars and only a short walk from the temple bar area. Breakfast was also first class in the lovely restaurant upstairs. We can't wait to return to Dublin and this hotel - amazing!!",5,2017,02,15
204,Relaxing Break,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in early February on a girls night away. This is the second time I have stayed there and I love this hotel. It is at the top of Grafton Street and so convenient to shops, theatres, restaurants and pubs. All staff very friendly and efficient. Food and drink a bit expensive at the Inn On The Green, but then it is a 5 star hotel. Bedroom very nice and beds comfortable. Good selection of food to suit everyone at breakfast. I will certainly be back to this hotel",5,2017,02,15
204,5*,"I was brought to this hotel by my amazing boyfriend, the best in the world. The hotel was fantastic, the breakfast was the best I've had and we met a celebrity. The hotel deserves 5 stars, my boyfriend deserves 5 stars and the breakfast deserves 5 stars",5,2017,02,14
204,GREAT : hotel & location,"We really enjoy Fritzwilliam hotel : first very welcoming, nice atmosphere, location exceptional.
We had a room on the 5th level just in front of the garden : unique.
Also, every night, we've found on our bed, special present (even for Valentine day)+ special ideas to visit Dublin. We recommend highly this hotel.",5,2017,02,14
204,Modern Hotel in the Centre of Dublin,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel whilst on a business trip in Dublin. It couldn't have been in a more perfect location. Around 30 minute drive from Dublin airport and the hotel is right in the centre of Dublin with Trinity college only a 5 minute walk away and hundreds of high street shops and restaurants literally on your doorstep. Even though it was very central there was no noise at night which was great. The hotel was very modern and the rooms were spacious and very clean. The staff were very friendly and the concierge were very helpful and able to assist you quickly. The breakfast options at the hotel were great. With numerous options readily available and also a menu which you could order off too.
The only criticism I would have is that the shower was either freezing cold and scolding hot there was no in between. As we were only staying one night this wasn't an issue but would definitely need to have been sorted if staying longer.
I would definitely return to this hotel If I am to return to Dublin in the future.",5,2017,02,11
204,Wonderful stay!,"Loved staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin. The room was beautifully decorated and comfy. The staff was accommodating and friendly. Honestly, it was so nice that I had to force myself to go out and sightsee. The tub and shower were amazing - I could spend a weekend just enjoying them without ever stepping outside.",5,2017,02,06
204,Wonderful stay,"Just in Dublin for a weekend.  Wonderful, helpful staff enabled me to make the most of my stay by helping me with parcel pickup from local stores and instructing me on train travel.  Everyone was very friendly and personable.  Hotel is conveniently located, within walking distance to most of Dublin.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  ",5,2017,02,06
204,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here last weekend for one night.  The room was overlooking St Stephens Green Park and opened out onto a small balcony. Rooms were very clean, cosy and beautifully furnished. The staff at reception were very pleasant and so friendly. The concierge team were so helpful and very pleasant also. Staff working on the bar that afternoon might want to brush up on customer service skills as everyone else was friendly and pleasant. Breakfast that morning was lovely and I really liked it was served till 12pm. Overall we had an enjoyable stay.",5,2017,02,06
204,Brilliant,"Top Hotel, really impressed. 
I was staying during a business visit to Dublin and was delighted with practically all aspects of the hotel. Really enjoyed breakfast and the rooms in particular. 
Thanks for a great stay!",5,2017,02,06
204,"Great beds, great internet, great location","I stayed at the Fitzwilliam recently for business. The room was clean, the bathroom as well, there was radio in the bathroom which was a plus. General amenities one would expect from a classy hotel were all present and in order. The beds slept comfortable, there was airco/climate control in the bedroom which greatly improved sleep quality. Best of all, internet in the room was strong signal and ever-present. Open network, so no logging in with usernames and passwords. I've not used the restaurant(s), any meeting rooms, or fitness area. ",5,2017,02,06
204,"Afternoon Tea, fabulous feast let down badly by the pokey corner we were located. ","One bright afternoon in January was spent with friends in the Fitzwilliam Hotel enjoying the wonderful Afternoon Tea. I had never visited the hotel previously so I was really looking forward to my visit. Having read the menu in advance of the visit I was pleasantry surprised by the arrival of the selection of treats both savoury and sweet. 

To say not a boring sandwich was to be seen was an understatement. Our waitress was very present and described The varied range and blend of teas for the occasion.  The freshness of the smoked Salmon, the plump blackberry and cheese and the smooth goats cheese encased in a rich beetroot cone, are a few of the savoury options.  
 The sweet options included scones plain and fruit/raisin scone. Delicate and delicious Macaroons, wonderful Opera cake, light and with a rich coffee filling, Black Forest and milk chocolate mousse served in a kilner jar. Some of the treats. Refills of our selected teas through out the tea were welcome. However a reminder to the waitress to include the basic preserves and clotted cream did not go down well.....

Our tea finished off with a choice of cocktail, elderflower spritz or Nutella martini. A wonderful drink to finish off.

To rate the afternoon tea alone 5/5 
The location, very poor stuck in a corner of the Inn on the Green, it was like a booth crafted by the tradesmen during the construction of the bar area, a space left over.

Some made find this appealing, a place to meet a secret lover for a drink, but for afternoon tea. Sadly No, just no.

The perfect location is the foyer area to the right of the main entrance, it would entice more people in to eat who may only be coming in for a drink. 

Fab afternoon but very poor location. 
Works I be back ,hell yes both, don't offer me the corner booth.
",4,2017,02,05
204,Good Hotel option in Dublin,Good location and facility. good and comfortable 5 star hotel. a bit over priced for what i experience though. shower had issues around temprature of water and bath was not functioning well. i upgraded my room to get a view - and was on the Luas and a working site. staff nice and generally attentive.,4,2017,02,05
204,Gorgeous welcome to Ireland!,"This is going to be a very honest opinion!  The Fitzwilliam was our first stop in Ireland---we got there straight off the Dublin airport.  Let me just state that it was the most incredible experience we had.  We were a bit awkward at first---please excuse these 2 Americans...it was our first visit to Ireland!  The staff was absolutely incredible and easy to speak with.  We were received with a warm welcome, our luggage was taken to our room immediately, and we were accompanied to the rooms in order to provide an immediate assessment of the room (whether it was of our liking---IT WAS!).  We were celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary and this hotel was just the welcome that any girl would had hoped for.  The location of this hotel could not be topped by any other hotel (just my opinion).  We had a  beautiful view, the room was warm and cozy.  We loved our bathrobes by the way!  The bed, the comfort, the restroom, everything was spotless.  The breakfast was to die for, and I found comfort in seeing that we had a great choice of breakfast options. I personally chose the poached eggs--and they were EVERYTHING!  The location allowed us to go into town and experience Dublin first-hand with a curious and open eye.  We walked to the Guinness Storehouse (by the walk...it was far but we are hikers/walkers/runners so it was fine for us).  We also walked to the Temple Bar.  Again, a wonderful experience at this hotel.  Will return and have already recommended at our business, family members, and close friends.",5,2017,02,03
204,Exceptional service,"Thank you Fitzwilliam for a great stay with friends for the weekend. 
Excellent location, so central and super comfy rooms. The shower was great! 
I have to say the staff at this hotel are some of the best I've experienced. Nothing was too much. Great service from all from check in desk to the cleaning staff. So helpful and very friendly. Special thanks to Travis at the concierge desk and the young guy in the bar who was working Sunday morning (29thJan), you were brilliant and went above and beyond to look after us. 
Thank you Fitzwilliam for a great weekend! ",5,2017,01,30
204,Great hotel,"Stead here for two nights with my husband, and what can I say, great hotel and staff, great location in the heart of Dublin, within walking distance to all the main attractions, shops, bars. Taxis, bikes and tram at your door step. Hope to get back again.  ",5,2017,01,30
204,Great hotel close to shops,"Lovely hotel, very comfortable with very helpful staff. I was impressed to get towels changed twice a day. The bed was very comfortable I slept really well and the hotel was very quiet even though it was in a very central position. Breakfasts were very good with lots of variety and all the staff were friendly. It's not the cheapest hotel but it's certainly paying more for the quality of service, convenience and comfort.",5,2017,01,30
204,What a wonderful find!,"We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights during our first visit to Dublin.
We could not have been more pleased with our choice. Fantastic location, beautifully decorated and very warm greeting by all staff. Room was large and very comfortable as well as well appointed. Fantastic bathroom also btw. 
The breakfast is highly recommended. Fantastic attentive staff that caters to your every need and the is a menu and buffet setup. Great start to the day.
The location on the park is ideal for sightseeing as well as heading out down Grafton Street with a convenient hop on hop off bus stop close by. 
The concierge was extremely warm and very helpful in finding a fantastic restaurant as well as calling to setup the reservation. 
The highlight was meeting a staff member in the hotel on the way to breakfast the first morning who was so incredibly helpful in helping us adjust our spontaneous itinerary for other stays in Ireland. Her help went WAY beyond a suggestion, she procured a reservation at an amazing rate for a location on our last night in the country. She did this on her day off and it was a perfect example of the warmness and helpfulness not only of the Fitzwilliam, but of the people of Ireland as well. We would return to the Fitzwilliam without hesitation.",5,2017,01,29
204,Just what we wanted,"Very central, attentive welcoming staff, lovely room.
We arrived at 10.00pm and were too late to grab some food at the bar but when we explained that we hadn't eaten and just wanted a snack the staff arranged some chips for us.
Would use this hotel again!",5,2017,01,29
204,Perfect,"This hotel is perfect in every way.....Location, style, cleanliness and are treated exceptionaly well. From the time you arrive to when you leave. The location is in the heart of everywhere. The rooms are big enough and very clean. The breakfast is large. All you can eat, and high quality.
The down side was I paid an arm and a leg for parking. My wife arrived the night before, and I got there around 9am. Checked out at 2pm and was charged €20.
This is a great place to stay.",5,2017,01,26
204,Impeccale customer service,"The Fitzwilliam is a remarkable hotel.  The decor is beautiful, the customer service makes you feel like royalty and the location is the best in the city.  We will always stay at the Fitzwilliam when we return to Dublin.",5,2017,01,25
204,Decent hotel,A good hotel ideally situated on St . Stephens green. Was a bit expensive in the bar but staff were good and friendly. Dublin is not a cheap city and this is reflected in hotel prices as well. Nothing wrong with this hotel and does a job. Gym was a bit pointless in a very small room.,3,2017,01,22
204,Very nice and charming in middle of downtown,I was invited from the Ireland Tourism board to visit Ireland and it´s beauty. The hotel gaves me a warm welcome with all comfort I expected and I really appreciated the personal and dedicated service offered by it´s personal. So it was the perfect stay for me and I spent some marvellous days in Dublin.,5,2017,01,18
204,A hotel which justifies its five star rating.,"Not only is the Fitzwilliam in a perfect location but the quality of the accommodation, the excellent breakfasts, the politeness, efficiency and helpfulness of all the staff make it a hotel that one can recommend unreservedly.  Moreover, in Mr Grant Sarkisyan, the guest relations manager, the hotel has a unique individual whose thoughtfulness and genuine interest in guests' welfare is a model to be copied and an invaluable asset to the establishment.   Full credit must go to the management of the Fitzwilliam for the excellent team spirit among the staff and the five star quality of every aspect of the hotel.  It is a pleasure to experience its justifiable five star rating.",5,2017,01,14
204,Perfect Spot to stay in Dublin,"We stayed a night at the Fitzwilliam between Christmas & New Year. The rooms are clean & nice, the bed was super comfortable. The location is awesome next to Stephens Green with shops and great pubs on your doorstep. The breakfast was amazing with plenty to choose from and who could go past the Traditional Irish breakfast, the bacon & sausages are delicious.
The staff were very efficient & friendly and I would recommend a stay here.
One small comment, turn the heat down a little, we were roasting.",5,2017,01,12
204,"High standard, High Quality","This is an example of how a hotel should be. Clean, friendly, latest standards of WIFI and suburb staff. I have really enjoyed my stay and will be back next time. Don't forget to try the ""best in town""  breakfast!",5,2017,01,12
204,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Staff","We stayed at this hotel in December. The hotel is in a great location to walk and see all of the sites in dublin, very convenient. The staff is excellent very friendly, and accommodating. We had a medical emergency when staying here and the staff got us in to the local doctor in 15 minutes. They also checked on my husband after we went to the doctor, just to make sure he was feeling better. What a great experience especially when your so far from home. The rooms were comfortable, and the sitting are and lounge we very nice as well. Highly recommend",5,2017,01,10
204,Birthday surprise ,"This was are first stay at the Fitzwilliam  as from check-in  to checkout  that staff couldn't do enough to make enjoyable .The hotel was clean and very handy to grafton Street and are room was both very comfortable and clean. The breakfast had a very good  choice available and the cooked breakfast  was made to order. I would highly recommend 
",5,2017,01,09
204,Weekend break,"This was our first time at the Fitzwilliam and 1st impressions were excellent. The staff are extremely helpful and the hotel is in a great location We ate at the Inn on the Green on our 1st night, food was lovely and staff friendly. What did disappoint was that this is a 5* hotel but the rooms fall short of 5* standard. We had to move rooms after the 1st night as a spring had come through the mattress, the staff arranged a move to a different room without fuss and told us that if we packed when we came back later in the day they would help us move. It was an inconvenience and the room we were moved to had a view but it was a bit tatty in parts. The mirror in the bathroom was cracked, rust around the sink, shower tiles not cleaned properly and any maintenance that had been completed was botched. There were marks up the wall and the suitcase rack was broken. Whilst I have listed the faults and they in no way made our stay uncomfortable or spoilt our stay we expected far better for £200 a night (without breakfast). We did have drinks that we had at the hotel taken off our bill but if you are not fussy about having some of the services that a 5* hotel provides and you don't mind the room finishes not being what you would expect I would save money and stay elsewhere, which is a shame as the hotel staff excelled.",4,2017,01,08
204,Couldn't fault this hotel,"We stayed here for four days in Jan. The staff were amazing, friendly efficient and attentive. Would definitely stay here again if we came back to Dublin. The location of the hotel was excellent. I couldn't fault this hotel.",5,2017,01,08
204,Always amazing!,"This is our third stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for the New Year weekend. The staff are extremely helpful and kind, the location is excellent and our overall experience was (and always is) superb! In particular, the staff at the Inn on the Green are out of this world. They make the best cocktails and they're friendliness made our stay. I would most definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam. (The underground parking is an added bonus!) ",5,2017,01,05
204,"Great Location, Good Concierge, Average Hotel, Poor Room","We paid additional for a 'view room' on the park side.  What we got was a view of construction, waking us up in the middle of the night.  We paid additional for a top floor, and what we got was an extremely smelly floor as one of the rooms must have flooded.  The room itself was cheaply decorated (and I typically like modern decor), small and not well maintained.  The location, other than the construction, is hard to beat.  Breakfast was fine.",3,2017,01,03
204,Made to feel special,"Stayed at The Fitzwilliam to celebrate New Year's Eve in Dublin. From arrival to departure I couldn't fault anything with the staff or the hotel. A warm welcome by staff as soon as you arrive, a personal escort to your room and bags delivered to your room. We had the breakfast package and were once again given a warm welcome, seated quickly and looked after by very attentive restaurant staff. Rooms are spotless. We didn't have a room overlooking St Stephen's Green but maybe a bonus on New Year's Eve as it was so quiet. Another friendly farewell as we left. Would definitely return to the Fitzwilliam next time I'm in Dublin. A big thank you for a very enjoyable stay !",5,2017,01,03
204,Great stay and wonderfully rejuvenating beauty treatments - hot stone massage,"Felt truly taken care of - best Eggs Benedict away from home. Yes, I once was a food critic in Boston, Mass. USA :)  Unfortunately, I have since forgotten the name of the massage therapist who was truly amazing!  She even predicted a major moment in my life - very accurately - that is happening now... 2 years later! 
Love and blessings from Switzerland",5,2017,01,02
204,"Great location, Friendly Staff, and Clean and modern rooms","The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin is located right in the city center and offers lots of activities to do within very close proximity to the hotel. On a warm day you will have no problem or complains walking anywhere you desire within the city as your hotel is never far from the action of the city. From the minute after arriving the staff was very welcoming and offered helpful advice and services throughout our stay. The hotel management clearly has a very well trained staff and is always providing a world class service. The rooms were updated, spotless, quiet, and comfortable. The restaurant in the hotel also offered a nice list of food options and provided quality food. I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel to anyone visiting Dublin as it provides fabulous service and accommodations, as well as being in a great location. Based on my experience you will not be dissatisfied with your stay.",5,2016,12,31
204,Our stqy at the Fitzwilliam,My wife and I stay at the Fitzwilliam during the Christmas holidays Dec 23-27 2016. We couldn't have been more pleased with our wonderful stay here. I would recommend this beautiful hotel to all of my friends if they were looking for a place to stay in Dublin. I would also recommend a room with a terrace if at all possible. My wife love this part of our stay the most! Especially going out and having drinks/snacks during the day and night.,5,2016,12,30
204,Great location and wonderful friendly Staff,Great hotel in a wonderful location.  Had a family room with Balcony and views overlooking St. Stephens Green.  Room was beautifully equipped and so quiet for a city hotel.  Breakfast was excellent and car park an added bonus as we were able to park up and walk to all the attractions.  Staff are so helpful and accommodating.  Will definitely return.,4,2016,12,29
204,As First-class as they come,"We stayed in three five-star hotels during our stay in Ireland, and The Fitzwiliam had the best service of them all- by far. In fact, I don't think I have ever received better service at a hotel in my life.
From the minute the taxi stopped in front of hotel and the doormen rushed over to grab our bags, to the front desk, whom not only checked us in, but actually walked us to our room and showed us around, to the concierge who helped us when my husband's bag was delayed by the airport, the service was impeccable.
We stayed there for four nights and during our time there we had complimentary mineral water (both still and sparkling,) chocolates every night, Christmas cupcakes, gingerbread cookies, and a fitzwilliam candle! 
It wasn't the largest or fanciest room, but the location and service made up for that! ",5,2016,12,29
204,Excellent Hotel and Location,"Whatever one likes or dislikes about a hotel,  memories will always be centred around how you were treated as a guest and what the staff were like. The staff, and I mean ALL STAFF at this hotel exceed any I have ever encountered in all my travels. I applaud you for your friendliness, kindness and efficiency and for the attentive welcome given to my grandchildren. Our Christmas was made not only with this second to none treatment but with the lovely food, service, cleanliness, comfy rooms and decor. A BIG thank you to the chefs who supplied us with Gingerbread biscuits and festive cupcakes delivered to our rooms and the scrumptious mince pies after Christmas dinner.   Chose this hotel just for our Christmas break but based on all the above and its adjacency to Grafton Street, St Stephens Green,  and the Gaiety Theatre to mention but a few, we would definitely return again and will be highly recommending to extended family and friends. Well Done to All and thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2016,12,28
204,Great Location,"We will definitely stay at this hotel again on our next trip to Dublin as we had a wonderful stay..

The location is great and it is walking distance to a lot of sites, restaurants, shopping, and bars.  The staff was always friendly and accommodating.
One of the biggest selling points for us was the breakfast as it was very tasty and included in the room price.

It would have been nice to have a bigger room, but we booked the basic room so it was not a big deal for us. The room was comfortable and everything worked properly.  
",4,2016,12,27
204,Poor service,"Had stayed in this hotel on many occasions as it has very convenient location and handy parking, rooms are tiny unless you get an upgrade, service is very cold most of the time but till now I didn't mind because it fitted my needs. However on this occasion I had to change my plans and cancel the booking, even if I did it a day in advance, they still charged me full night's rate. I didn't realise that hotel changed cancellation policy to 48h recently. As I booked on Booking.com I even offered to pay for commission- but was very bluntly responded- sorry full charge will apply! Being a hotelier myself I know Dublin wasn't busy at all on Monday night and meeting me half way wouldn't have compromised any financial budgets or forecasts. Don't think I'll be returning anytime soon!",1,2016,12,20
204,A Taste of Heaven on The Green,"What a wonderful hotel, simply devine. We stayed for my birthday and enjoyed every moment. The staff, service and room were faultless.  I cannot recommend it enough.  The staff are friendly, helpful and very thoughtful. The location of the hotel, with parking, is perfect for a city break. It is ideally situated beside St Stephens Green for a relaxing walk, and Grafton Street for shopping. I will be back.",5,2016,12,16
204,Quite and Centrally located,The hotel is located right off the main shopping street and across from a major park. Easy access to quite good restaurants and shopping. The room was very quiet and very comfortable and was cleaned promptly after we left so that we could return to the room in the day for a rest. We had a courtyard room and it was very nice. WIndows that open were a plus too.The only issue was that the faucets (and shower) were very sensitive and a bit difficult to adjust to get the desired temperature. No big deal really.,5,2016,12,15
204,"Warm, friendly and welcoming staff","We had a wonderful night in this hotel - from our arrival to departure next day. All of the staff were very friendly and most helpful. Our room was spotless and very quiet - loved the piped music, very soothing.
The decor throughout the hotel is very striking, in particular for the Christmas season.
Thank you for a memorable stay.",5,2016,12,12
204,"First Class Hospitality!! Very Sophisticated, But Still Very Warm...","Stayed here last week for five nights while traveling alone on a business trip far from home in New York. Thanks to the the incredible staff and management at the FitzWilliam, traveling alone NEVER felt less lonely.  They took great care of me.                

Located right across the street from St. Stephen's Green, the hotel is close to most of the business addresses I had to visit, and a block away from Grafton Street, which was great for after work and some holiday shopping. The front desk staff greeted me warmly, and couldn't do enough for me over the course of my stay. The room was very comfortable - great bed, soft sheets, rainforest shower, deep soaking tub were all big pluses - and spotlessly clean.  I had dinner at the bar three nights, as it's just feels more comfortable while dining solo.  The barmen were engaging, and provided good dinner conversation, especially, Tomas, Aaron, and a Beverage a Manager Tom. Food was great - enjoyed sea bass and roasted chicken, but lamb stew was amazing. 

I'll be back to Dublin in January, and am delighted to have a new home to go to.",5,2016,12,11
204,"Great location, lovely staff but not impressed otherwise.","I stayed in the Fitzwilliam for one night a few weeks ago and found it very average. Certainly not 5 Star in my opinion!!

Given the hotels location, the carpark was incredibly full. We drove in and got stuck in the lower basement along with more cars. Eventually, someone left and we found a parking space. There wasnt any sign of valet parking being offered at the front.

Reception is nice I suppose but it doesn't have much of a wow factor considering its a 5 star hotel. 

Reception staff were excellent and couldn't have been anymore helpful.

The elevators felt like they needed a good clean. The carpets were dirty and the elevator was very dark. 

The room was very small. Definitely the smallest I have ever been in. I found it very claustrophobic. It was clean though. The beds were small - just a double bed. Don't think they were king sized. They weren't uncomfortable but they were on the hard side for my liking.

The bathroom was small but clean - however it was nothing to get excited about. The bath / shower was odd. There was a rainfall type shower with only a little water coming out of it. The water was cold too. However, there was also a handheld shower attachment that was incredibly poweful and hot. This would have made a great shower except that you had to hold it and it didn't attach into a holder on the wall. Sigh!! 

We ordered room service- 2 club sandwiches, fries and 2 cokes. The food was nice but very expensive. The sandwiches with fries(€5) were about €23/24 and it was €3.50 for a coke!! 

You can't beat this hotel on its location. Its located at the top of grafton st. Easy access to shopping, restaurants and near night life. Across from st stephens green. 

Overall, don't expect the hotel to be 5 star and you probably wont be disappointed.

",3,2016,12,11
204,Nice Hotel - Great Location,"The Fitzwilliam in Dublin is a nice hotel in a great location - on St. Stephen's Green. Rooms have all the normal features. Staff is very friendly and service is excellent. Breakfast is a buffet with choice of entrée included. Restaurant service is also excellent. We had our company Christmas party in a function room - great service and excellent food. Overall, a goof hotel for stays in the city.",4,2016,12,11
204,A PERFECT STAY!!,"Nothing can be improved on,with this hotel. If you want to stay in Dublin, stay here, it also will enhance your experience of Dublin, even putting aside the perfect location!!!
Staff were ALL very friendly, I have NO HESITATION in recommending this hotel to travellers!!",5,2016,12,07
204,great stay,It's a really nice hotel in a great location. Rooms are very nice.  Weak link is the gym which is just a few pieces of equipment. You couldn't ask for a better location.  I had a problem with lost keys at the hotel and Johnathan at the front desk went way above and beyond to help me out.,4,2016,12,06
204,Top Rate!  extremely convenient to city centre shopping,"stayed here for a Christmas party held in the hotel.  beautiful rooms, very luxurious.  top quality food.  really convenient to St Stephen's Green park and to the city centre shops.   25 minute wait for breakfast though.",5,2016,12,05
204,"Nice Stay, Great Location","The location was a selling point for this hotel. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We arrived early in the morning and were very happy that a room was available. Mixed feelings about the restaurants on site. Overall, we had a nice stay.",4,2016,12,04
204,"Great location, great service ","What else can you ask for. Very clean. Cozy. Great service. Breakfast included was good. Location, very centric. Would stay again. The mattress was a little hard for my taste but then again that could be a very personal taste. Keep it up Fitz! 😀",5,2016,12,04
204,Top Class,This is a brilliantly run hotel with every effort made to make you stay as enjoyable as possible. It is the small details that matter and they do exactly that. The breakfast is fabulous with the service equally as good. With the location and service level you cannot beat this in Dublin City Center. The only negative is the room heat and ease of using aircon.,5,2016,12,02
204,Comfortable and convenient stay,"Myh husband and I had a nice one night stay in this hotel.  The service was great and the room was clean. I appreciated the large bathroom, but the rest of the room was pretty small though expected. Our room was very quiet.  I don't remember hearing any noises in the middle of the night. Very convenient for exploring city-center.  Parking was very easy.  For a nice hotel, parking was pretty inexpensive. The construction around the hotel was annoying but there's not much that can be done about that. It was a little pricier than I wanted to pay, but with so many of the other hotels lower than this price range looking like total dumps, I was happy to pay it. I would stay here again. we didn't eat or drink at the bar or restaurant so i can't comment on that.",4,2016,12,01
204,Disappointing,"My partner and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam a few weeks ago for his birthday, so it was to be a special occassion. 
When we arrived we were greeted by a nice gentleman who told us we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe suite which was a lovely surprise. He then told us we needed to pay a deposit of 100 Euros, when we advised him we hadnt been made aware of this prior to our stay, he explained it was optional but if we wanted to use hotel services such as the minibar we would need to pay the deposit, so we agreed to do so. The gentleman then kindly showed us to our room, which was beautifully decorated with an extremely comfortable king size bed, bath and shower, and a heated balcony which overlooked St Stephens Green Park. Later that evening one of the hotel staff brought complimentary chocolates and a scented candle to our room, this really added to the finishing touch and made us feel the hotel had gone thay extra mile. 
The breakfast the next morning included a buffet cereals, fruit, juice, yoghurts and a selection of meats and pasteries which were well presented. There was also a large selection of hot food to choose from, we opted for the irish fry.
Before going to check out we both felt very pleased with our stay and talked of returning again. However the treatment didn't last. When we got to reception to check out we were greeted by a young lady who took our details, then advised she would refund our deposit of just 10 euros as they would be deducting 90 euros for our room upgrade. When we both explained the gentleman had given us a free upgrade( he was nowhere to be seen) and that we never requesed this. The lady was very hesistant said we had requested this, when we kept explaining we didnt(infront of a queue full of guests which was embarassing) she spoke to her colleague who advised her it was a misunderstanding and to refund us the full amount. The lady agreed to do so and that was it, no apology or remorse for the humiliation we had just endured.
To top it off the lady emailed me the following day and said that after our bconversation at reception, she would be taking the 90 euros from my account. I couldnt believe this after being given a conplimentary upgeade they had the audacity to try and charge us, even after admitting it was their mistake. After several emails of trying to explain, they finally agreed to refund us the full amount.
We left Dublin feeling very disappointed at the fact we were made to feel somewhat of second class citizens, after we believed the hotel to be of a high standard. It was supposed to be a special occassion, but sadly ruined by the service.",2,2016,11,30
204,Rooms getting a little tired,"We have stayed here a few times over the years, and on this trip we all commented the rooms are looking tired. The furniture is worn and marked, and needs updating. Coffee cup rings stained into the wooden desk tops, chipped and banged wardrobe doors, hot and cold taps barely useable and in need of repair. Not what you expect at this price level. Turn down service poor. Didn't happen at all on our first night, and second night, they didn't pull the blinds down and didn't close the curtains properly and left big gaps. Complimentary chocolates looked like they had been thrown into the room from the door. 

Front of House service was really excellent. Much better than previous visits. Nice cocktails too in the lobby next to the fire with the Christmas trees. Bar cold and anaemic with distant service. Probably would look elsewhere sadly next time in Dublin. Its an expensive Hotel, and isn't as cool as when it first opened. Location is superb though.",3,2016,11,27
204,Great hotel,"We had a very pleasant stay here. Staff were friendly, cheerful and helpful. The rooms were impeccable with trendy modern interiors. The hotel is in an ideal location for shopping around the grafton street area. This hotel met all our needs and was very comfortable. The only small negative thing that could be improved ",5,2016,11,27
204,Breakfast five star but rooms in need of a refurbishment,"Reception staff and bellboy were welcoming. However bedroom and ensuite are in need of refurbishment. The furniture was shabby and dated and the bathroom needed upgraded. The breakfast however was a real treat - truly 5 star! Choice, range and quality of food and service were excellent.",4,2016,11,27
204,"Nice Hotel, but I Expected More","I chose the hotel based on positive reviews and it's location.  The location was great - as expected.  The overall experience however was fine, but not as nice as I expected.  The lobby area is pretty small, as is the restaurant.  The room was fine, but maybe a little worn.  The heat is radiator based and cool air is through an A/C system.  I turned the radiator adjustment all the way down, but the room was still too warm.  The front desk suggested turning on the A/C, creating two competing systems, which was not a great solution.  (The windows open so I used them instead.)

My experience was also influenced by some bad timing that aren't controllable by management.  When I checked in, there was loud construction work going on in the lobby, though it did finish that afternoon.  The fire alarm then went off at 4:30 AM, and the elevators were out of service later that morning.  Lastly, there was road construction in front of the hotel that prevented my car to the airport from driving in front of the hotel.  Instead the driver had to come get me and we walked the luggage around the block, ironically in front of the Shelbourne.

Overall, this is a nice hotel, but I think for a similar price level, I would experiment with another choice in the area.",4,2016,11,27
204,Some highs & some lows which is a pity,"We had a return visit to the Fitzwilliam on a recent Saturday night. I tend to have mixed feelings about the Fitzwilliam. I really do not like the set up in the bar - the seating and lay out to me are cold and uninviting and it has zero atmosphere. As it transpired we had a few drinks after dinner up at the bar counter that night & we thoroughly enjoyed it & the staff were in good form. But the rest of the bar still does nothing for me.

There is also on-site parking at an overnight rate of €10 which is convenient and excellent value considering you are city centre. If travelling by car you do need to remember to approach it from the right (North) direction of St Stephens Green.

The bedrooms are colourful and nicely designed but they are also beginning to show a bit of wear & tear. Our room had a broken drawer, was poorly lit & had a missing bulb - not exactly what you expect from '5 star'. The wifi was poor and intermittent and a call to reception did not resolve the issue.

The breakfast room is a rather stark affair - looks more like a work canteen to me. We both felt the quality & presentation of the cooked breakfast was terribly poor and certainly not '5 star'. There seems to be an absence of any quality control and the bacon in particular should not have been served - it comprised bent over pieces of fatty bacon which looked as if they had been steamed rather than fried or grilled.

In my opinion the breakfast setting and offering needs some critical review - it really is sub standard particularly having regard to how the hotel promotes itself and the price level. Quality control would be a great starting point.",4,2016,11,26
204,Nice hotel....Bar poor,"Stayed for two nights.......Sunday and Monday......Nice hotel.  Staff excellent, room fantastic with view.  Hotel bar dreadful.  Very cold, constant stream of people, not guests walking through bar, carrying take away coffee, not what you expect in a 5 star hotel.  Breakfast very good, dinner in the restaurant awful. Cold, and microwaved.  Not as good as Belfast.  Room for improvement. Great location.",3,2016,11,25
204,Perfect,"Excellent location
Easy walk to many attractions
A bit pricy but worthwhile 
Staff and service exceeded expectations
Had 3 people in group and placed in a good sized suite
Washroom even large for Europe 
Will return",5,2016,11,21
204,Perfect Stay,"We had a very extremely reception at Fitzwilliam Hotel, the receptionist was very helpful. For me it is a great sign of good service when the guest is accompanied to his room and gets a short introduction to it.
Room 441 was very clean, bright and offered plenty of storage space. Particularly noteworthy is the excellent noise isolation.
The bathroom was a pleasure: long tub, strong waterpressure, helpful lighting and a make-up mirror.
Wide range of in-room dining.
Breakfast buffet is also generous and delicious. Highly recommended and perfect for a weekend-trip!",5,2016,11,20
204,Total Excellence ,"When you walk into the Fitzwilliam you know you will have an excellent experience. Our room was comfortable, the dining areas very good (note; the fine dining restaurant has closed) and the hotel is close to shopping, pubs and attractions. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. My wife particularly liked Ursula, from the spa.",5,2016,11,18
204,"Best thing, the staff","First impression was a good one the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. 
The room was comfortable.  
The bar was very disappointing for a 5 star hotel. It was more like a social club, very basic.  They did food there, but as it wasn't very inviting we decided to eat upstairs at the mezzanine restaurant 
It was a Monday night and apparently the restaurant on mezzanine does food  but the kitchen not open... so by the time food eventually arrived, it was tepid.  
Very disappointing evening.  
The next morning however, as kitchen was open, the breakfast was freshly cooked and very good. 
Could be improved overall.",3,2016,11,18
204,Really really lovely stay,"Fantastic room, fantastic bar, fantastic restaurant (Thorntons - separate review) and fantastic service.  The concierge was helpful and the complimentary umbrellas extremely useful!
We had breakfast which was very good and nice and relaxed.
A really memorable trip.  Just wish we could have stayed for longer!",5,2016,11,16
204,Friendly run hotel,"As commented elsewhere, the staff are great. Very friendly welcome from a very international team of staff. Even the door and lobby team maintain a friendly style.
The barman was not quite as friendly as the rest but hey it was a Monday night when I arrived. The top shelf is well stocked with good Whiskeys too if you fancy a digestif or nightcap.
The hotel has all the features I need and the rooms are large by Dublin standards with all the facilities you could need, including a 'brolly. The only (and I'm nitpicking here) was the bathroom taps in general need an overhaul as they dont open and close easily. 
Breakfast on the Mezzanine is grand and you can order off the menu. Full Irish, Omelettes or continental, all are well catered for and the service is quick enough. 
There was a problem with the alarm in the morning when I left but as I was on an early flight it didn't matter to me and was surely a one-off problem.
I stay in Dublin around four times a year on Business and will always stay here if its not full!.
Thanks to the staff.",4,2016,11,16
204,One night stand.,"We stayed 4 persons in two rooms for one night.
I am truely amazed by the very very friendly staff. Also to recive a welcomming e-mail before arrival I found nice and useful.
The Hotel is perfect central location for everything in Dublin.
The rooms is as expected in perfect condition, and all was working as it should.",5,2016,11,15
204,"Great location, attentive staff, wonderful breakfast","Boutique hotel with stunning interior decor. Very attentive staff - especially reception and door staff. Great central location with easy access to the Luas. I stay here often for work, but mostly don't have breakfast included in my room rate - it's a great day when I do - they put on a great spread and the juices in particular are to die for! The bar has a lovely quietly buzzing atmosphere in the evening and the bar food and cocktails are great quality.",5,2016,11,15
204,Perfect location for a weekend in Dublin,"Spent three nights here recently; friendly, hospitable staff.  A requested room change was quickly taken care of, no questions asked.  Large comfortable room on 2nd floor, facing the street.  Triple glass keeps it very quiet, despite hustle and bustle below.  Ate in the bar twice -- good food, friendly staff.  The staff is extremely accommodating, I can't stress that enough.  The hotel is perfectly located to explore the pedestrian streets that surround it.  I'd definitely come back here given the opportunity.",4,2016,11,14
204,Exceptional in every way!,"We have just spent a wonderful weekend in Dublin. I'm not sure I have the words to describe just how fantastic this hotel is. The staff are amazing and nothing is ever a problem, they are so helpful and really want your stay to be perfect. Breakfast is superb, an extensive menu of cooked breakfasts and a fantastic buffet with fruits, juices, smoothies, breads, pastries, meats and cheeses. We ate in the Citron restaurant, and the food was stunning. We loved the bar, fantastic G&Ts! I really hope we can visit the Fitzwilliam again one day.",5,2016,11,14
204,"Great hotel, great staff!","We had a great stay in Dublin, thanks to the hospitality at The Fitzwilliam! From an early check-in to dinner and travel suggestions. The hotel itself was beautiful and in the perfect location on St Stephen's Green. Highly recommend.",5,2016,11,13
204,"""Great Welcome""","Spent one night upon arriving from LA , our luggage had not arrived on our flight and we were tired and upset. The reception staff could not have been nicer, and also the concierge who kept reassuring us that our luggage would arrive (as it did 10 hours later)and went out of his way to find a local restaurant and book a table which suited us perfectly, keeping in mind we had no change of clothing.! Beds were great and bath is huge, just a lovely place to stay with easy access to lots of shops and restaurants.",5,2016,11,12
204,Superb city centre holiday and fantastic for breakfast,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam again. The stay was perfect! Really fast uncomplicated WiFi.  Breast was fantastic - try the porridge, which is just sublime. Also good at breakfast were the eggs Florintine. Just a perfect stay and can't wait to be back again!",5,2016,11,12
204,Nice and well placed hotel to explore Dublin,"Fitzwilliam Hotel met our expectations well! The hotel is of a good size, not toot big but sufficiently large to offer good service and facilities. Nice breakfast buffet and Quick service for hot dishes. Ver good location for most of Dublin's sights.",5,2016,11,06
204,Great central location ,"We just spent two night there upon arriving from The States. I was very impressed by the front desk. We came from Phoenix and had major flight delays and missed connection. Needless to say long flights and long waits at airports and we were exhausted. 
We were immediately tended to and they did everything to get us in our room to settle in quickly. 

The rooms are very well appointed. Clean and cozy. Also comfortable bedding and a very nice bathroom with a soaker tub.

Daily breakfast was decent. They served a variety of fruits, yogurts, cheese, meats and breads. Hot items were also available such a eggs Benedict and pancakes etc. 

We very much enjoyed our time at The Fitzwilliam.  They have set the standard high for our onward travels throughout Ireland!",5,2016,11,05
204,Very comfortable stay,"Spent a few nights here whilst in Dublin for a conference. The room was extremely comfortable, clean and spacious. WIFI connection is also good. Breakfast was also top notch with ample choice at hand. 
One comment however about the bar staff who took their time in serving guests.",4,2016,11,04
204,"Great Location, Staff but But Room with Abysmal Lighting & Seating","The hotel got the hard things right & the easy things wrong. You couldn't pick a better location. The entire staff was terrific. The room was clean. The breakfast and wait staff were superb. Those are the things that are hard for a hotel to do as well. 

The lighting in the room was terrible. There was no easy chair for reading if there had been enough light to read. The bench seats made it tough to get to the window and could not have been more uncomfortable. Comfortable furnishing and good lighting should be easy. If you don't like to sit comfortably and be able to see what you are reading, the hotel is perfect.",3,2016,11,03
204,Amazing stay at the Fitzwilliam,"The staff were so helpful and attentive, checking each evening if I had everything that I needed. The cleanliness of the room was first rate and the bath and shower were great quality. When I do come to spend a second time in Dublin I'l look to stay at Fitzwilliam.",5,2016,11,02
204,Wonderful Hotel,"My husband and I stayed in this hotel for four nights at the end of Sept., beginning of Oct.  I cannot praise it highly enough, everything was perfect from check in to check out.  Our room. as one would expect, was spotless and very comfortable.  Breakfast was excellent,  the food in the hotel restaurant was delicious.  The staff were efficient, courteous and wonderfully friendly.  We are looking forward to returning to the Fitzwilliam, Dublin.",5,2016,11,01
204,Dublin Marathon Weekend,"Excellent service.  All staff very helpful and the little touch of providing a goodie bag for the marathon runners was very thoughtful.  Also, even, though we had already checked out in the morning, the hotel provided showering and changing facilities for free after the marathon, which I considered very decent and respectful. ",5,2016,10,31
204,Anniversary stay,"We got married here 10 years ago so we had to go back for our milestone anniversary. We had our 9 years old son with us this time. A very friendly place if you come with children even at the bar - thanks, it was important for us and not always a given in a 5 stars hotel. Top location, excellent service especially from the girls at reception. Nice touch in our room when we arrive: plate of fruits and macarons, balloons and a lovely card. We couldn't have asked for more. Thank you to all at The Fitzwilliam for making it so special. ",5,2016,10,30
204,Just a Walk from the Green,"Across from St. Stephen's Green and essentially on Grafton St, unbeatable downtown location.  

We only had one night to spend in Dublin, so a central location for shopping on Grafton Street and pub hopping on Temple Bar was critical.  The Fitzwilliam fit the bill. 

Traditional, nicely appointed room with deep old school tub in the bathroom was a treat.",5,2016,10,28
204,Great location-lovely hotel,Just stayed at the Fitz-William last week. The hotel is located on the Green and at the beginning of Grafton St which is the main pedestrian area for shopping and restaurants. Our room was on the small side but very comfortable and away from the street noise. Nice bar and lobby area and fabulous breakfast. Excellent customer service. Interior is trendy and modern.,5,2016,10,28
204,Stay at the Clayton please,"Its a moral obligation to give a poor review.   I travel 150 night per year in Asia, Africa and Europe and never had such poor/offensive service than I have at Fitzwilliam Dublin.    Staff clearly views guest as punters and have no qualms letting guests know that they are not to be trusted, nor should they be looked after.    God forbid you ask for any assistance beyond paying for your room,  how dare you ask a purple coated staffed member for assistance.  They will say know and charge  you full whack for a room .",1,2016,10,26
204,good hotel in the city cdntre,"Exelent hotel. Easy to reach from te airport by bus. Good service. In the hart of dublin. Next to the st stephens green park. Park has a lot of history and so does the rest of the city. Easy to walk to temple bar area. Door man and tourist info in the hotel. Nice bar at the ground floor. 24hrs desk service. And good hotel rooms. Clean room. Bath tub, shower, tv, good bed, mini bar etc",5,2016,10,26
204,Great location,"Lovely rooms, short walk to Trinity College to see the Book of Kells and the Trinity College Library. Fairly heavy traffic and a longstanding public transportation improvement project make the route a bit circuitous, but not a major problem. Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,10,23
204,Stunning location - couldn't wish for better,"Stayed here on business for two nights, and as we were travelling to different locations, this was an ideal location.  It wasn't cheap, but then - with the current Sterling collapse - not many places in Ireland are.  But this is worth the money.  Levels of service were definitely five-star and the breakfast was excellent.  Kippers available at no extra cost - smashing!  More exotic tastes such as mine also catered for - a whole honeycomb to cut at, and a jug of beetroot juice if that sort of thing takes your fancy for breakfast.  Other - more traditional - versions of breakfast are also freely available (assuming you book breakfast in your rate, that is.  It's €22 otherwise.

The tram stop is outside, there's also a taxi rank and you're right by Grafton Street for the shops.

And finally, the beds are really comfortable so you shouldn't go home with a crick in your neck, although you could end up with a hole in your pocket!",5,2016,10,23
204,Very pleasant stay,"The team was very very friendly and made us feel welcome from the very first moment. The room was nice, facing St. Stephens Green. Good windows as we could not hear anything from the street above. Breakfast was good too. Location to explore Dublin is ideal, almost everything in walking distance. Would love to come back.",5,2016,10,23
204,Fantastic!,"My wife and I spent 3 nights here and absolutely loved it. Mentioned to the concierge Tony it was my wife's 40th birthday he went above and beyond my expectations in making my wife's birthday very special. From breakfast to dinner there were special surprises aligned along the way making my wife feel the most special woman in Dublin that day. He also helped us arrange day trips and recommended the citron restaurant located within the hotel and we weren't dissapointed the food and staff were fantastic. The accommodation, surroundings was nothing less than what you would expect from a 5 star hotel however it is the staff that who make the Fitzwilliam hotel. Everyone made us feel so welcome concierge, reception, bar, waiting staff even the chefs spoke to my wife after her birthday dinner to ask how her meal was and wish her happy birthday. I've never felt so well looked after even the resident manager Will approached us on several occasions to ask us how we were enjoying our stay. If your going to Dublin I thoroughly recommend the Fitzwilliam hotel even the location is perfect.",5,2016,10,23
204,Week long vacaation,"Fitzwilliam hotel
Oct 14 to 25 2106
Room 621

We first arrived and were greeted with friendly service and the doorman who escorted us to a day room allowed us to store our luggage with a have a shower use the restroom as we waited for short time. We were also told by manager Grant that we would be upgraded to a mini-suite which included a living room dining room area full bath comfortable bed.  

The rooms are very comfortable and everything works properly and there's not much in the way of views from our 6th floor suite #621 but there is a green roof outside.   This hotel is located near Grafton Street and on Saint Stephen's Green Square.  Grafton Street acts like a pedestrian mall most of the time of the shopping district that has interesting places to explore. From this location it seems like most of exciting Dublin is within walking distance even Trinity College.

The concierge and manager both took a personal interest in making sure that we were comfortable and delivered several amenities to the room including large bottles of water welcome chocolates and a sightseeing an information packet all of which was helpful.

The washroom is quite large with a wonderful but tight shower that is adequate size and well appointed bath amenities. If you are like me you will  certainly need a full classic a shower but can make this work.

Understand from a local chef we met at Sheehan's that Thornton's is closing at the end or 2016.  See our local food option reviews, there are several great ones close by.

This is a great location for a wonderfully walkable city.  Easy access to grafton street from which you can branch off left and right into the side streets and discover wonderful little shops and eateries.  Also to walk to St Patricks or the Guinness Storehouse learn the back way to walk it, it is only 15 minutes but not very scenic.  You can wander back throughout the Temple Bar area and up Grafton which takes much longer but has an infinite number of jumping off points.

Bottom line, a well appointed luxury property with friendly and helpful staff and in a perfect location as a base of operations for a Dublin visit.

204,4 stars only,"I went a full weekend with my family. I slept in a superior room with park views.
The hotel is simply. Is like a weak four stars.
The gym is so little. The room normaly and smart. The bathroom old.
The breakfast is normal, but the bar service excellent.
The employes are so good and kind.
I think it needs a big renew.",3,2016,10,18
204,Great location and fantastic staff,"This hotel is in a great spot for both access to the main City, good restaurants and is only about 20 mins from the airport.
The staff here are super friendly and amenable.
The rooms were clean, comfortable and as sold, however maybe slightly on the tired side. The hotel has a good bar, which has a good atmosphere for those not wanting to venture out. It also has parking availability which is only €10 for guests.
Only slight criticism is that you can hear the pipes and noise of other guests' showers.
",4,2016,10,18
204,Anniversary Visit,We choose to stay at the Fitzwilliam after starting here over 10 years ago and it didn't disappoint. The service was excellent both before and during our stay. The cocktails come highly recommended. Great location to access the city,5,2016,10,16
204,Great hotel - only let-down was breakfast,"I stayed here on business. The hotel is immaculate - the room was spacious with generous wardrobes, very comfortable bed and seating. The bathroom was beautiful with all usual mod-cons and the nice thing was it was warmer in there than the room, so I could snuggle in bed but going to the bathroom it was nice and toasty in there.

Room included tea & coffee, safe, iron and ironing board, proper hairdryer, all good.

So all in all it was great apart from one thing. The breakfast items out were lovely (fruit, and what tasted like freshly squeezed orange in the dispenser thingy) apart from the cooked breakfast. The fried eggs had pools of fat grease on, the bacon similar and it somehow managed to be bland which is quite a trick with bacon. Disappointing. 

So with that one reservation, a good review. But, I do like my cooked breakfasts, so that one thing was a real shame.",4,2016,10,15
204,"Great location, wonderful customer service and a contemporary, whimsical decor!","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for four nights and had a wonderful time! I'm a bit confused by other reviews who found it to be dated and worn. Our room was contemporary, warm, and inviting...I love the purple decor!
Service was outstanding!! the concierge and door men where always quick with a warm greeting and assistance and the pub and restaurant suggestions were always on the mark. Turn down service was great and the couple of times we ate and drank at the bar were great!",5,2016,10,15
204,Great Location & Staff but you pay for 5 star treatment and getting a 3/4 star hotel,"Just back from a 2 night stay at the Fitzwilliam Dublin. I booked a 'family room' for my mum and child, however when we got there the room was very small and so we had to get her a room of her own. We purchased the 'zoo package' which in total cost 1,506 euros for the 2 rooms for 2 nights. Although I had planned on us all staying in the one room.. but it was just too claustraphobic. 
Our room was at the front so we heard lots of ding dings from the trams and people outside through the night. 
I tried to have a bath but the water was cold I called to reception they explained the boiler had tripped. That was ok so i tried to have a shower in the morning the water was still cold. Apparently it was left over from the night before. 
The manager was very apologetic and offered our family a complimentary meal in the restaurant that evening. They also sent a scented candle and truffles which was very nice and they did try to rectify any inconvienience. I cant complain about the staff they were all very nice and accomodating. 
I booked treatments for myself and my mum which were spa prices.. therefore i assumed the hotel had a spa. When we got there we found a lady with a make shift beauty treatment room with a squeaky massage bed. Althought she was very good and a lovely lady the room was also small and claustraphobic and certainly not what we were expecting from a 5 star hotel. 
Overall great location and staff but for the price just not worth the money.",3,2016,10,13
204,Stephen's Wedding,"It feels like home to me, I love this hotel situated on St Stephen's Green just steps from Grafton St. walking distance to the theatre, with lots of fine restaurants and bars to visit. One of my favorites is Davy Byrnes. And don't forget to stop in to Thomas Patrick on Grafton street and buy some shoes. Brown Thomas is one of my favorite shops Great designer department.",5,2016,10,13
204,Worn...,We stayed here for two evenings. The rooms were very worn out. The TV's did not work. The dining room service was very slow. This hotel needs a definite revamp. I believe it lives off of it previous reputation versus the actual reality. It is used for a lot of tour groups.,3,2016,10,12
204,"Fantastic hotel, highly recommended","This was our first stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The hotel is in an ideal location for shopping, bars, restaurants and sightseeing . The only downside is that it was far from our favourite book store Chapters but then we cannot blame anyone but ourselves for buying too many books.
The rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable. Breakfast buffet and room service were great. The staff are extremely helpful, professional welcoming. We truly enjoyed our stay and can highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,10,11
204,Great location great hotel,This is our 4th stay at the Fitzwilliam and every year we look forward to our stay. The location is perfect. The hotel is modern but the rooms are comfortable. The sheets are at least 500 count and after a day of walking and touristing and shopping you look forward to coming back to the room for some relaxation. Not to mention the great breakfasts. Love this hotel.,5,2016,10,08
204,"Great location, perfect service",Our recent trip to Ireland was concluded by a stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin and it was a great way to end the trip. The service could not be better as we were made to feel like VIP's from the time we stopped our car at the curb till they tucked us into our cab for the airport. The location near Trinity College was perfect with great dining and shopping just steps from the front door.,5,2016,10,08
204,Wonderful warm and welcoming experience,"Over in Dublin for a family event and was highly recommended this hotel, but even so this recommendation did not do this hotel nor its staff justice!! What a wonderful and welcoming hotel, the staff so intent on making this trip a great experience, so helpful and the rooms really comfortable and quiet even when you are right in the heart of Dublin. So I can without a doubt recommend this hotel when visiting Dublin.",5,2016,10,07
204,Great location in city centre. Disappointed with service.,"We loved the location.  Service was good and the room comfortable. Disappointed that we had to beg for a corkscrew to open our wine bottle. There was no corkscrew available in the room, when we called room service they said someone would be right up.  They were but advised us he could open our bottle for us but he needed the corkscrew back.  If we wanted another bottle opened, he would came back up.  Cannot believe that we pay $500+ a night for a room and something like this would happen. I thought it was a joke, so I called the front desk.  The person was friendly, but still.... I would look for someplace else the next time.  Also, we were in the bar we could reserve dinner in the Michelin rated restaurant. However, we knew from a friend it had lost it's rating and we found this a little misleading.",3,2016,10,06
204,Unbelievable help during a difficult time,"The is a relatively new hotel located on St. Stephen's Green in Dublin.  While walking near the hotel my wife fell and fractured her elbow.  The hotel staff immediately arranged to get my wife to the best hospital in the area where surgery was done.  They extended our stay ""as long as necessary"" to allow my wife to be discharged and recover before leaving Dublin.  Everyone was incredibly caring.  I cannot say how strongly I would recommend the Firzwilliam Dublin.",5,2016,10,05
204,Modern hotel with traditional service,"My husband and I spent two nights at this hotel late September.  The hotel is a modern building beautifully situated on St Stephen's Green.  Our premium room overlooked the Green and the corner of Grafton Street.  It was very well appointed with high quality bedding, linens and toiletries and at all time was kept spotlessly clean.
The feature which distinguished this hotel however was the superb service from pre arrival reservations until our departure.
Our reservation process was over the Internet.  All of our inquiries were handled promptly by the reservations staff.
On our arrival we were met at the curb by the helpful door porter.  The reception desk
handled the checkin efficiently and assisted me to settle into our room while my husband returned our rental car.  While I was awaiting his return in the lounge the concierge staff were ever attentive.  They were also extremely helpful with restaurant recommendations and general advice about Dublin.  
Throughout our stay everyone of the Fitzwilliam staff tended to our requirements efficiently and with a smile.  This hotel is a class act .
I would like to make special mention of concierge Patrick who was exceptional.",5,2016,10,05
204,The heart of the Fitzwilliam,"From the moment we checked in, we experienced the Fitzwilliam way.  The staff, from the front desks, to bar staff,  to breakfast servers, to housekeeping,  to the concierge were, without exception, friendly,  extremely efficient and so very helpful.  Travis went out of his way to assist us several times.  And one night, after a discussion with the young lady at the front desk about getting up early, she called our room to suggest a wake up call!  The room is  very comfortable and well appointed, the location is great and the breakfast is generous, with many delicious choice.  But our first visit to Dublin was made special by the heart of the Fitzwilliam.... Its people.",5,2016,10,04
204,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam on our recent visit to Ireland.  It was one of several hotels that our Travel Agent gave us to choose from.  We now know why.  The rooms were impressive.  There was a sound system in our room as well as the largest bathtub we encountered in the five hotels we stayed in during our recent trip to London and Ireland.  The room had air conditioning, wifi, room service, and a mini fridge.  They went above and beyond, including writing us a note and sending chocolates to us because we were visiting on our anniversary.  From the moment you walk to the door of the Fitzwilliam, the staff is there to assist you.  The concierge stored our bags as we were several hours ahead of check in.  The front desk checked us in and took our number and called us when our room was available.  By the time we returned, the staff had placed our bags in our room.  The person who checked us in walked us all the way to our room so she could familiarize us with the room and the sound system.  They really go the extra mile at the Fitzwilliam with customer service and the small details like plants in the room and bathroom.  We truly enjoyed our time here.  ",5,2016,10,04
204,Very Comfortable and Great Location,"We only stayed a night and it was very nice.  

Good:
* The room was nice
* Staff was welcoming and gracious
* The location was really great
* Valets were great
* Breakfast was generous and fresh

Bad:
* The shower and tub drained slowly causing backups.  Maintenance tried to fix promptly but couldn't easily.  The hotel knocked 100 Euros off the bill (which was very gracious IMO).

I'd stay at the Fitzwilliam again and recommend it to others.",4,2016,09,28
204,Amazing experience ,An absolutely beautiful hotel. Rooms where very up to standard. Perfect for business or a romantic get away. Food was top notch. Had a very relaxing time whilst staying here. Staff are friendly and helpful ,5,2016,09,28
204,Convenient and with good service,"The hotel has an excellent location near Grafton street and mall. Rooms are properly equipped and service is prompt. I had a problem with the electrical socket and it was repaired instantly.  The interior garden is nice and well maintained.
Only remark is about the mirror in the room which does not fit with the rest of quite modern and austere furniture (see photo).",4,2016,09,28
204,Outstanding service and comfort,"Recently stayed in the Fitzwilliam while attending a conference at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland which is just down the block. Very friendly, knowledgable and helpful staff, especially the concierge. Breakfast is very nice with the option of ordering from the menu. Room, while not large was very comfortable. Excellent free WiFi.",5,2016,09,27
204,Lovely Dublin hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights in Dublin at the FitzWilliam while on family holiday.  Great location, helpful staff, very nice rooms.   Close to everywhere you want to be in Dublin.  Was there with my wife and two kids (15, 13).  Very nice breakfast.  Truly enjoyed the stay and would recommend to others.",4,2016,09,25
204,Excellent -,"WE stayed with friends for two nights.  we had fantastic rooms and the breakfast choice and quality was lovely.
Staff very helpful and accommodating - nothing too much trouble.  The concierge desk staff were fabulous especially Marcin.",5,2016,09,25
204,Disappointed,"We booked one year in advance for a 3 night stay in a premium bed/breakfast room. The compact room we got was a very long walk from the elevator. Moreover it overlooked a large construction site (no view and noise), the window was locked, and most importantly the air conditioning was centrally turned off at 1am for the rest of the night. The resulting high room temperature greatly hindered sleep. It took another day and some insistent conversation with the staff to get moved to a different cramped room with working air conditioning. Very disappointing. On our last day my wife and I were each offered a limited price bar drink to make up for our inconvenience. Really??? 

The room mix up also happened to at least two other couples who booked far in advance. Our stay happened to coincide with the Gaelic Football championship in Dublin. The hotel was full. We wonder if our original rooms were assigned to someone else willing to pay a higher price. In any event, the fact that this ""luxury"" hotel would as a matter of course automatically turn off the air conditioning all night long in portions of the hotel mandates an extremely low review rating from this affected patron. 

The hotel does have a good location and friendly staff. 
",2,2016,09,24
204,Nice location in downtown Dublin,"Top notch hotel, great service, great breakfast.  Room was very clean, bathrooms spotless.  Quiet location on the 5th floor. We had been given a room on the 6th floor but their elevator stopped on the 5th floor so stairs were not an option for us.",4,2016,09,23
204,Visit to Dublin ,"We were here for our 25th anniversary 
An expensive place for a mediocre amenities. There is a bad odour on entering the lobby. Too much construction just outside the hotel. 
There are no natives working at the hotel. 
Room is too far from the elevator. The thermostat did not work. ",3,2016,09,21
204,"Great Room, Great Location. Great People","Stayed at Fitzwilliam over a weekend - got a lovely room facing St. Stephens Green with a balcony where the tricky Irish weather let us have breakfast al fresco. 

Very central, lovely views, great and friendly staff. We are definitely staying there next time we are in Dublin.",5,2016,09,20
204,Awesome Hotel,"Stayed for just one night but the service was awesome. Went to the hotel a day before check in to ask some questions about an excursion. Very helpful even though we weren't staying there. Checked in early & they stored our luggage after checking out. Beautiful clean room & location couldn't be better.  
",5,2016,09,15
204,Mr.,"No A/C betwween 1AM and 6AM. Stuffy air. Can't sleep. It is centrally dissabled.
Otherwise is ok. Friendly stuff.
 Good concierge service.
Free bottled water is good.
Beds are comfertable.
Location is excellent.",2,2016,09,15
204,Comfortable and Central fora weekend away.,"A friend and I chose The Fitzwilliam for our girl’s weekend away; the hotel provided everything we had hoped for. On arrival we were greeted by the pleasant, helpful staff who ensured throughout our stay we were well taken care of.
 Our twin garden room was not quite ready so we were offered complimentary coffees and a mobile telephone number was taken to contact us as soon as the room was available. A simple gesture that we both agree made us feel valued not just a number. The room was well appointed with a large bath and shower and very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and at night there was a turndown service, who left two delightful chocolates on the pillow.
The hotel is within five minutes walking distance of the smart shops in Dublin and many public houses and restaurants. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but several guest recommended the food.
The Fitzwilliam will mostly certainly be the hotel of choice next time we visit Dublin.",5,2016,09,14
204,Where have the friendly Irish gone?!!,"A very expensive mediocre hotel. Didn't come across one native worker or customer either. I could have been in Japan for all I knew! €400 it cost for bed & breakfast. Breakfast was not of 5 star standard. No milk in container, no scrambled eggs. When I ordered the photograph shows what I got. A slop of hard egg. Toast was cold. Smoothies are delicious though, had 2 of them. Nothing Irish about this hotel whatsoever, where have the friendly Irish gone??? BTW...I have absolutely nothing against foreigners working, but please, this hotel is not geared for Irish customers at all. Totally lacked a good 'ol friendly red haired cailín to greet you. Just saying 😏 Definitely not worth the money!",3,2016,09,14
204,Weekend break with friends,"We had a lovely room on the 4th floor, with a 4 poster bed. The room was a nice size clean & tidy and we couldn't fault it. 
Location wise the hotel is at the top Grafton street right next to St.Stephen's  green. This was ideal for the ladies to go shopping and the boys to shoot off in the car for a game of golf. The hotel has an underground car park which was perfect for our needs.
We have now visited the hotel for the 3rd time, it was our friends first visit and we are planning our return trip already 
The staff cannot do enough for you and its always a pleasure to stay at the hotel",5,2016,09,13
204,"The total package - service, location, accommodations and dining","As other reviews have shared, the staff is absolutely among the best I have experienced.  Personable, helpful, and top notch. Plus they looked their role as professionals.  The concierge guided us to well-suited to us restaurants each night which resulted in memorable meals.  We also dined in the hotel our first night and I liked the cod so well I wanted to return, but we always want to experience different restaurants.  

We chose a terrace room overlooking the park, and at first, I was impressed with how small it was and had taken action to move to a different room for the remaining three nights.  But for whatever reason, we took a second look around and decided to stay with the terrace room.  The room was a bit quirky, as there were only three small drawers and absolutely no room for luggage storage. My husband lived mostly out of his suitcase, while I stacked items in the nightstand shelf and other strategic areas.  There is substantial hanging space. I stored my luggage under the desk as best I could. 

The bed was very comfortable, if a bit small, but the bathroom was efficient.  As others have mentioned, the water pressure in the shower is very strong and the water is hot - both positive details.  One has to use a giant step to get into the tub and a well-located handle might be a worthwhile addition as the existing handle in the tub is near the shower head.

Accessing the terrace was not via a sliding door but via a footstool that helped one step over the windowsill to get out.  The window opened as a door or window. Once outside I felt as if I were on a London rooftop. Each evening found us outside with a glass of wine.  A fun space.  This is a visually shared space as if our neighbor had been on his terrace, we would have seen him but we were always the only ones outside.  A table and chairs with cushions plus a heater complete the terrace.  Dublin is not a tall city, so even the 5th floor perspective over the park seemed higher than it was. 

While there is street construction in front of the hotel, it was a bother only to drivers. It did not affect us.

The hotel location is perfect for shopping and strolling. St. Stephen's Green is appealing and one can walk to many attractions and restaurants.  The lobby is nicely designed as are the associated restaurants and bar.  

The FitzWilliam is a great place.  We are glad we chose it and bet you will be, too!  We would return.",5,2016,09,11
204,Expensive- but you get what you pay for,"The staff at the Fitzwilliam are so good (and the location is so exceptional) that it you almost don't mind the room rates. The rooms are small (hardly a surprise given the location), but unusually functional (lots of plugs, including ones handy to the bed, for example - amazing how many hotels get that wrong). Best hot shower I've had in an Irish hotel in a long time.  Breakfast is outstanding as well.",5,2016,09,11
204,Warm and friendly ,"We loved our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Our room was fantastic with a view of the St. Stephens Green.  The staff was warm and friendly...in a uniquely sincere way, not phony and over the top just really really nice.  The location of the hotel could also not be better.  We could go out sightseeing or shopping and the convenient location allowed us to take mini breaks throughout the day.  I do have the say, however, I do agree with some of the other comments about the Fitzwilliam not really being a 5-star hotel.  It just lacks that little bit of extra luxury.  That said, I would rate the hotel a very high 4-star and will definitely stay there again.",5,2016,09,11
204,All Around Top Notch Quality and Service,"We had two stays  at the Fitzwilliam, before an eleven day Ireland tour and after returning to Dublin  The service we received from every area, including reception, food and bar service, housekeeping, and bell services was outstanding.  When we checked out the first time we were to meet our tour at a hotel a few blocks away.  The bell captain insisted on assisting us by taking our luggage to that location. His assistance was most thoughtful and appreciated.  Also, we enjoyed the high quality breakfasts which were served in the bistro each morning and excellent service we received in the bar.

It was evident that good service was a priority at this hotel and we would certainly stay there again if and when we return to Dublin.",5,2016,09,10
204,"Great location,friendly staff, unusual decor","I stayed here with a friend on a busy weekend, It was a last minute booking we made but thankfully was a lovely stay. Staff were helpful when we asked for advice about where to eat.Our room was clean and we really like the style and colours of the room.I would recommend, especially because of the location. :)",4,2016,09,10
204,Only Place to Stay in Dublin,"Great location. Great service. Great accomadations. Great rooms. Great! Great! Great!
Cannot be a better place to stay in Dublin!
Have been to many hotels, this rates among the best for the quality of the staff, service, rooms, restaurants, and location. ",5,2016,09,08
204,"Location and reception staff top class, felt a little rushed at dinner","stayed here recently for my birthday as a surprise from my hubby, we had friends come and meet us in the hotel for dinner.  The food was delicious however I felt we were a little rushed at dinner, tried to get us to order dessert with our starters and then by the time we got or first course everything slowed down... a lot.  But the food was great, and the front of house staff are second to none, will certainly be back again",4,2016,09,07
204,Wonderful stay,"We were booked into this hotel by our travel agent. It is perfectly located. Even though there is construction outside, you never hear a thing. There are additional windows in the rooms so the sound is blocked. We had a great life lunch at the bar. Staff is very friendly. ",5,2016,09,07
204,AG,"Excellent service, food, rooms and location. No complaints! Would stay again in a heartbeat. Ate in the hotel restaurant in the  mezzanine at lunch which was really good and in Thorntons in the evening. Excellent experience. ",5,2016,09,07
204,In the City Center,"Lobby is very open and airy, yet cozy.  Our room was large and light.  Bed was comfortable.  Had a sofa that was very hard and not comfortable.  An added amenity was a radio with great sound that we used quite a lot.  Staff was helpful.  We arrived several hours early and they were helpful in holding our luggage for us til rooms were ready.  Being in the City Center, attractions and restaurants were walkable in all directions.  We did not use the hotel's restaurant or bar, so can't review those.",4,2016,09,06
204,Fantastic location!  Lovely hotel,"We spent three nights in this lovely hotel right on St. Stephen's Green in Dublin.  The location was perfect for all we wanted to do in the city - we walked to the GPO, Trinity College, St. Patrick's and Christchurch, all the museums, etc.   Shopping and restaurants could not be more convenient.  It was a great base for the days we spent in Dublin.  The hotel itself is very modern, but with fun little touches like raised tubs and ""old fashioned"" taps and phones.  Purple is certainly the signature color and anything that could be monogrammed was blazoned with an ""F"" - which made you smile after a while (and made it easy to pick out your umbrella - which the hotel conveniently provides - from the pile at the door where you left it).  The rooms are nice size for a hotel in the center of a city - and everything is new and in great shape.  Lots of plugs - both US and UK types - in convenient places for modern travelers with lots of devices that need charging every day.  And lots of closet space to unpack and stash cases out of the way.  We didn't eat at the hotel (too many other good options nearby) but the breakfast buffet looks substantial and the bar seemed lively.   Every day we came back to lovely little touches - chocolates on the pillow, or a note and a little snack from the manager,  The staff were very friendly and welcoming, and the concierge desk was always manned and helped with information and booking our return to the airport at the end of the stay.   It was really the friendliness and little touches that made you feel that you were truly a ""guest"", not just a customer.  I enjoyed coming back at the end of each day and relaxing with a cup of team, putting up my feel for a few minutes before heading out to dinner or the pubs.  This is an excellent choice in Dublin if you want modern conveniences and charm too, with a location that can't be beat.",5,2016,09,06
204,Great location and friendly staff,"Located in a heart of City and offering great base for walking around and discovering the City. Construction works in front of the hotel were a bit disturbing but only until  entering the hotel. Room was well isolated and quiet.
Classy service and friendly staff. Great breakfast too.",5,2016,09,05
204,Great staff,From the time I phoned reservations all the way to breakfast the staff were so friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. Location is excellent so close to everything. Special thanks to Martina in reservations she above and beyond for us. Will be back again!,5,2016,09,04
204,"Very Nice Hotel in Heart of City, Convenient to Much","Very nice hotel with service-oriented friendly and very helpful staff....beautiful rooms (mine overlooking an interior garden, which was lovely....4 poster bed, very nice pillows and excellent amenities...housekeeping a bit slow but responsive when pinged....on St. Stephen's Green, so convenient to lots of things...1/2 block from Grafton Street, South William (renovated area with decent restaurants).",4,2016,09,03

204,Classy and amazing service,The Fitzwilliam is the epitome of a classy establishment. The staff was so helpful and they go above and beyond to make sure your stay is fantastic. The concierge helped make us a lot of reservations and directed us around the city with ease. Great breakfast too!,5,2016,08,29
204,Excellent,"Perfect hotel and great location
The staff are very friendly and well experienced.they answered all my questions plus they advise you with their recommendation which is great 
Would love to come back again soon

204,Our Wedding Anniversary,"We have stayed in the Fitzwilliam twice. Both times they never disappointed. Our last trip was our wedding anniversary, this year. It was absolutely beautiful, they had chocolates in our room on arrival wishing us a very happy anniversary. Rooms are always lovely and spotless. Staff are extremely friendly and very polite. Even checking if they could book dunner reservations for us, but we were already sorted with Saba right around the corner. Breakfast are always great. Lovely spot and would definitely be going back for another visit.",5,2016,08,27
204,Cozy and relaxing,"My stay last week was very peaceful and lovely. Very cozy and nice interior, door to door to the mall and the RCSI were my course was held and just infront of the beautiful st. Stephens green park. Would highly recommend the place.",5,2016,08,24
204,Great Hotel in a Great Location in middle of the Hub of Dublin,"This was a great hotel with great service. All the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. The location was fabulous, we could walk anywhere with ease. If we wanted to go somewhere not in walking distance there was always a taxi waiting outside to take us. Next time we are in Dublin, we will defiantly be staying here.",5,2016,08,24
204,Friendly central hotel,"Few days break with friends.Good clean rooms overlooking the garden. Breakfasts good and friendly helpful staff.
Central position to see the city.
Only negative the bathroom fan didn't work , we did mention it to front desk but nothing was resolved. 
The side of the bath was like climbing Mount Olympus not got if arthritic!",4,2016,08,23
204,Lovely weekend break. ,"We booked the Fitzwilliam hotel online from the UK.  Pre-arrival information and pictures were accurate.  Reception were very helpful. We arrived very early on friday morning, and were given two rooms on the 4th floor which were next to each other.
The hotel is perfectly situated at the top of Grafton Street with plenty of bars, the Gaiety Theatre and lots of restrauants a very short walk away. (Be careful however as some of these are tourist traps)
The rooms were clean and well presented, although some of the wood surfaces were showing their age. The bathroom was clean and tidy with fresh towels daily. The turn down service each each evening and chocolates was a nice touch. 
The bar was conveniently located next to reception. We had dinner in the bar one evening of our stay and all the dishes were well prepared and nicely presented. 
At the weekend breakfast is a buffet affair, coffee was quickly offered however we had a considerable wait for baked beans (available on request) and toast. The buffet cooked breakfast was well layed out and hot although by the time we were the beans arrived it was substantially cold. Undeterred on Monday we arrived and immediately ordered our beans and toast when it arrived we went to select our cooked  breakfast only to find that  during the week breakfast is served  a la carte. So today the cooked breakfast was hot and the beans not so. It did however explain why there had been menu's on the table (Our bad)! Throughout, the waiting staff were helpfully and attentive. Coffee and tea were hot and plentifully supplied. Overall the staff throughout the hotel were helpful and made our short stay very enjoyable.  Many thanks for a great long weekend stay. We'll definitely stay here again next time we come to Dublin. ",5,2016,08,22
204,Most Central Location for Overnight stay in Dublin,"This was my second time staying here. Once for a rugby match and recently for a business meeting. Staff are lovely, rooms are small but ok for a short stay. Large choice on breakfast menu, all cooked from fresh. 
Centally located in city, its a perfect base for shopping, touring or nearby Aviva stadium. Will be returning on my next trip. ",5,2016,08,22
204,Remarkable hotel and staff,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is simply beautiful and the service is exceptional!  We stayed for four days in a deluxe premium guestroom and the amenities are superb.  In our room was a handwritten note from the manager of guest services welcoming us along with cookies, macaroons, chocolates and large bottles of water.  The fresh orchids and freesias are a wonderful touch.  The doormen greeted us each time as did the bell captain.  Our flight was delayed and our luggage did not arrive until the next day; however, the staff had it waiting in our room for us after a day of sightseeing.  Our room had a view of St Stephen's Green and the surrounding area - being able to open the window for some fresh air was also wonderful.  If we are ever in Dublin again, we will be staying at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2016,08,21
204,Superb Location and Service!,One of the most friendly and accomodating hotel staff we have ever encountered.  We stayed stayed for a week and they could not have made our stay more enjoyable.  And the location is as good as it gets!  Easy access to Stephen's Green and a comfortable distance from the Shopping Centre!,5,2016,08,18
204,Not of 5 star standard.,"It's more like a middle of the road 4star. No wow factor, we were very disappointed. Bar food was just ok, breakfast was another let down. Staff pretty nice. Just no extra touches, eg. Paper promised to be outside the room but wasn't, instead the house keepers knocked on our door and actually came in at nine in the morning!! Our room was tiny, noisy and not 100% clean, it also seemed like it was a mile away from the reception! Would not recommend staying here to a friend.",3,2016,08,17
204,Superb Stay,"I chose the Fitzwilliam based on other reviews on Trip Advisor and my stay surpassed the excellent reviews I read.  I asked for a quiet room away from the elevator and stayed in room 626. 
I think furthest away from elevator possible !  Thank you for honoring my request. Please note    the Elevator stops on fifth floor, with steps up to sixth so perfect for us but might be tough for those with disabilities. The Room was perfect, bed so comfortable. Great showers and amenities. 
",5,2016,08,16
204,Excellent hotel,"Do you want very good experience in Dublin hotel? Go there!
 excellent  service, specialty in breakfast room, cleanliness perfect in the room 
Everyone try to help you for everything.

204,Excellent weekend at the Fitzwilliam,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights this weekend, what a beautiful hotel, great customer service, friendly staff and brilliant room. The bar staff were great and helped with good recommendations of where to go for our nights out. We will definately be back.",5,2016,08,16
204,Great stay in the heart of Dublin,"My first trip to Ireland has definitely started out excellent! Fitzwilliam has been part of the good experience. Extremely pleasant staff. Clean, comfortable modern rooms. A great hotel with perfect amenities. Would stay here again and would recommend it to others. I would agree with another review about the banging doors. All in all, a near perfect place!",4,2016,08,14
204,What an amazing gem of a hotel ,"My partner and I enjoyed a 2-night stay at the Fitzwilliam and the whole experience was a joy from beginning to end.

We arrived early due to our flight (9.30am) but despite this our room was ready and we were given a warm welcome. We were escorted to our room by a very pleasant member of the Reception staff - a lovely touch

We enjoyed drinks in the bar on our first afternoon and evening, and were again treated to very friendly and highly attentive service.

Breakfast was to die for - an amazing array of choice, with the offer of honey from a whole honeycomb something we have never seen before.

So, all in all, a truly fantastic hotel, in a great location!",5,2016,08,09
204,5 star boutique 😊,"From the moment we arrived they made all four of us really welcome.  They also let us check in an hour early.  They parked our car and we're shown to our rooms.   The reception staff and porters were super.

Our rooms were stylish and tastefully done.  Fresh flowers  in the rooms.  We had dinner in there Michelin star resturant which  was fab.   Breakfast was fine.  They also let us check our again later as we were getting the ferry.  Would def go back again if we were in Dublin ",5,2016,08,09
204,"Excellent location, great staff","Just got back from a few days visit. The hotel is extremely well located for shoppers and sightseers alike! Plus it is smack in front of a park which lending it a quiet and beautiful surrounding. Staff extremely friendly, breakfast delicious, rooms spacious and clean. The only ""remark"" is that the hotel has looooong corridors. I would probably ask for a room closer to elevators next time.",5,2016,08,08
204,Brilliant location,"One of the best hotels in Dublin. Friendly staff. The location is close to perfect. No worries about parking. Just arrive outside and hand your keys to the staff. A bit expensive, but you get what you are paying for. ",5,2016,08,08
204,The gem in the Emerald Isle,"From the first moment we arrived at the Fitzwilliam hotel we were made feel so incredibly welcome, like our stay there was important to the manager and staff. In particular Fergal the General manager, Patrick the Head Conceirge and Niamh on reception made it such a pleasure. We went for a very much needed R&R and without question this hotel treats every aspect of this. The hotel, surroundings and professionalism of the staff are all second to none. Oh and the breakfast was superb with our 6&8yr olds very much enjoying it! The 'afternoon tea' was something to experience for all you foodies out there, it was an incredible fusion of flavours some with an unexpected twist! An amazing time in an amazing place that came at the perfect time for our family and we cannot wait to return! ",5,2016,08,08
204,Simply.The.Best.,"First, I have NEVER had an hotel email me prior to my stay to welcome me and ask if there is anything they should know before my visit.  The Fitzwilliam did and started our wonderful stay off on the right foot before we even set foot in the hotel. They asked when we would be arriving and if we were celebrating anything special.  Well, we were.  Our anniversary and my birthday.  Our flight was late from the states and yet when we finally got to our room around 10:30 p.m.Polina made sure that we had cold champagne and a fruit platter to celebrate.  Our room was lovely, clean and all the finishes were spot-on.  Our room was quiet, and not only had powerful A/C (it was warm in Dublin) but coffee and tea makings ready to go.  We had breakfast included and it was delicious, cooked to order and with a large selection of breads, cereals--even a honeycomb with fresh honey dripping into a bowl. The front desk (Polina again, did she ever get to go home?) helped us find a pharmacy and then allowed a late checkout so we could see the city and experience the Guinness Storehouse.  Yes, there is construction in front of the hotel, but we never heard it.  The location is perfect--right next door to the shopping mall, close to the HOHO bus and Grafton Street.  We were thrilled with our one night stay and wish it could have been longer. And, the purple décor is certainly memorable.  I hope this is your choice too. ",5,2016,08,05
204,Perfection! ,"This perfect hotel sits in the heart of this friendly and delightful city.

Gorgeous rooms, impeccable and delightful service and with nothing too much trouble - especially sorting out visits and best places to visit.

Don't be too put off by the building of a new Luas (tram) line - a minor blip for a time!

Good outstanding and simply outstanding.

Go!

204,Lovely hotel in the heart of Dublin city,"My husband and I were at a concert and booked a deluxe room. It was beautiful. We had a huge 4 poster bed which was ridiculously comfy. The bathroom was lovely. Our room overlooked St Stephens Green. We took advantage of the valet parking, it was very convenient to be able to drive to the hotel door and leave the parking to someone else. 
Breakfast was delicious, and the service was excellent. 
Unfortunately with our room being at the front of the hotel and Dublin being such a lively place, we were kept awake by a club a few doors down from the hotel. As the hotel was full we couldn't switch rooms. 
At check out the manager apologised for our inconvenience and offered us a free upgrade to a suite next time we stay. At check out we also discovered that some horrible person had charged over 100 euro of drinks to our room! The staff were able to sort this fairly quickly, after removing the drinks bill we were given an extra discount on our bill as an apology. 
I really enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam and will definitely be back, I'm especially looking forward to my free upgrade!",5,2016,08,04
204,A very expensive 4 star at best,"Im really not super how this Hotel managed to get a 5 star rating. The best thing about the Fitzwilliam Hotel is the location. Just off St. Stephens Green its perfect for a first time visitor of Dublin. Beyond that this is a very average Hotel with simple rooms, small lobby, restaurant and breakfast areas. Dublin has much better 4 or 5 star hotels than this with more character and higher levels of service.",3,2016,08,04
204,Great Dublin Hotel,Good central location with easy access to Dublin highlights. The service from all the staff was excellent. We did not have dinner there but the breakfast buffet is exceptional. Room was very clean and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed the three days we spent at this hotel.,5,2016,08,03
204,Long weekend away ,"A long weekend in Dublin with friends, having arrived at the city as we've a wedding on Bank Holiday Monday. The hotel reception staff were so friendly as are all the staff in the hotel. Nothing is too much and wifi is free. Very central to the town centre. Asked for marmite for my toast and by Sunday they so kindly brought it for me. Went on the red route hop on and hop off bus on Saturday, Gerry was the compere, very entertaining and informative made the whole ride so funny. Went to The Bank for lunch and a pint of the famous Guinness. Jameson Tour is a must as is the Guinness Museum. Would definitely recommend the hotel to any family and friends who mention they will be visiting the city.",5,2016,07,31
204,"Noisy, fake “five-star” hotel with no clue about proper service or breakfast","Although it bills itself as a “five-star luxury hotel,” the Fitzwilliam was actually faking. It was my mistake not to dig deeper into the true nature of the Fitzwilliam Hotel before committing to spend several days there this summer. The decision was driven by factors (wanting to be close to the city center etc.) that were overpowered by the stunning mediocrity of this hotel. As I post this, I have written nearly 40 TripAdvisor hotel reviews. In more than 75% of them, I have given the hotel four or five stars. Most of the rest got three stars. Hotels have to work very hard indeed to earn less than three stars from me. The Fitzwilliam earns two stars in my view. Why? Let’s consider two types of factors. 

FIRST TYPE: Aspects a hotel has little control over. 

Physical aspects of a hotel building may be difficult or impossible to fix. Noise inside the rooms, for example, can come from other rooms or from outside. Some hotels are simply constructed in such a way as to allow guests to hear all sorts of goings-on in neighboring rooms. At the Fitzwilliam, we heard nearly everything: water rushing so loudly through the bathroom pipes that my wife and I could no longer hear each other speaking in a normal voice in the bedroom. I actually had to double the volume on my computer so that I could hear the speaker while this colossal rushing sound was going on. It felt like the washing machine was on the spin cycle and I was inside. This was followed by a gurgling sound from the shower drain that was so loud that it again interrupted our conversation in the next room. When I asked the hotel to send someone up, a concierge arrived who professed to have never encountered a problem like this in the hotel except once, in a different room, a long time ago. That may or may not have been true but it was a good way to speak to a guest – respectfully. I wish others had taken his example. 

I had multiple other issues with noise, one of which – a TV blaring in a nearby room for several hours – caused me to call the management. A manager and a concierge both came to the room. The manager said there was nothing he could do about the noise. The concierge – a bit more training might have helped here – said “It’s a hotel! You can’t expect the walls to be thick!” In my world, I do. I guess that’s just my bad. One star off.

The street noise was intense as well, to the point that I was awoken at about 3am on a weekend night despite keeping the windows closed and wearing noise-blocking earplugs. What woke me was drunken shouting and singing. But if you leave the window open – and the window does open – and the room faces onto the street, you will hear the incessant “ding-ding!” of the streetcar from 5:30am until 12:30am; construction noise; groups of passers-by; and street musicians. Sometimes the cacophony was pleasant. Other times I had to close the window. 

Another aspect the hotel cannot really control is the plumbing. It is unlikely that a hotel will close down so that the plumbing can be repaired. The reason I would recommend that the Fitzwilliam look at the plumbing is that I found it nearly impossible to adjust the temperature of the shower and the stall was so small that there was nowhere to escape when the water alternated between too hot and too cold. In fact, the stall was so narrow that it was almost impossible to even bend over and pick up the shampoo. The reason one would have to bend (aside from a woman shaving her legs – also an issue, I heard) is that there is no shelf for the amenities. There is a soap dish which is fortunate given the lack of one by the sink. But the soap dish is curved and, if there is soap in it, it is slippery. No place to put the shampoo. Another star. 

SECOND TYPE: Aspects a hotel has a lot of control over but, despite that, may not give a toss about

Assuming that a prospective guest at the Fitzwilliam is not deterred by the unaddressable issues like noise from nearby rooms, there are many issues that the hotel could directly address if it bothered. Inside the room, there were multiple physical faults that added up to the feeling of staying in a non-five-star hotel. The shower door did not fit properly on its frame. There was no soap dish next to the sink. A five-star hotel cannot afford a soap dish? Apparently one is supposed to leave the wet soap on the glossy counter next to the sink, where it leaves a sloppy mess. Or one can leave it on a small elevated glossy pedestal on that counter, where the staff places fresh washcloths and amenities every day – and where the soap leaves a sloppy mess. Really?

Much worse than these little nits was the service. The staff placed a premium on being friendly – until I actually needed something. I was returning from a seven-hour guided outing in the surrounding countryside. I emerged from a Range Rover heavily loaded down with gear – camera, binoculars, camera case, jacket etc. As parking was very tight in front of the hotel, my host approached the two doormen on duty and said that he was only stopping briefly to drop someone off. As I emerged from the car, I realized that the paper bag in which I had stored the wrappings from my snack was still in my guide’s car. I reached in and grabbed it and promptly had no hands left to reach in my pocket and pay my guide’s fee. I walked up to a doorman named Dane and asked him politely if he could take the paper bag off my hands. I told him it was garbage. He pulled back. He looked uncomfortable. Clearly he was not going to help. He then started to indicate something across the street. “Oh, is that the nearest trash bin over there?” I asked, saying to myself, there is no way I am delaying my guide and walking across the street festooned with all this gear just to throw away a paper bag. I crammed the bag under my chin and walked back to the car to pay the guide. I heard Dane asking me if I was a guest at the hotel. What did it matter? Even if I wasn’t, how much trouble was it going to be to throw away a paper bag? Walking away, I said “Yes, I am staying at the hotel and don’t bother.” So he didn’t. Seeing me juggling all of my items, he made no move to come over or to help at all. He just watched me while I paid the guide. This behavior is so far below the standards that I have come to expect from staying at five-star hotels around the world that it left me speechless. Unless Dane is really in the wrong job (I cannot really judge that), I cannot imagine how ineffectual and inadequate the training is that the Fitzwilliam provides its staff if this is the end result. Dane could have easily attempted to rescue the situation by apologizing – by saying most anything at all, in fact – and by offering to relieve me of some of the many items I was carrying. But he didn’t. I still can’t understand it. Two stars. Look out below.

The other element that pushes the Fitzwilliam into the two-star range is the breakfast. In the days before my arrival, I had stayed at a different hotel in Ireland that truly earned a lofty TripAdvisor rating. So I know from recent experience that breakfast can be done much, much better than this even in Ireland – especially in Ireland, the land of scones and Irish breakfast tea. I am not judging the Fitzwilliam only against real five-star hotels I’ve stayed in such as Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons hotels. I am comparing it to one of its Irish peers. In my view there is no excuse, none at all, for this:

•	Porridge so weak it tasted like flecks of oat floating in a sea of milk
•	Porridge again, this time following a request not to put any milk in it, served drenched in so much honey one could not taste the porridge
•	Eggs ordered “over easy” that came out congealed on both sides with a hardened yolk
•	No edible cereal from a US point of view – just “shredded wheat” in 4-inch logs, something that looked like Weetabix and the most generic knockoff Corn Flakes imaginable. 
•	A “bagel” that was not even a poor imitation of one – more like white bread – Wonder® bread! – in the shape of a bagel. I did not manage to get past the first bite before sending it back.
•	Scones not as good as one would get in the supermarket (the “real” five-star Irish hotel had the most amazing scones I have ever tasted – what a letdown to arrive at the Fitzwilliam)
•	No fresh fruit in the heart of strawberry and blueberry season, just cut-up melon and grapefruit and other fruits shipped in at great distances (again a big contrast to the “real” five-star hotel) 
•	Brown bread that was literally impossible to cut without it crumbling
•	Tasteless cheeses, especially cheddar – no flavor at all
•	A draft through the middle of the restaurant so powerful that even with multiple layers it was hard to withstand
•	Tea served in random canisters with random numbers of tea bags (usually too few). No excuse at all for this in the country that originated Irish Breakfast tea, which is excellent when made properly.
•	Coffee so bitter as to be undrinkable
•	Servers who were well-meaning but inattentive, repeatedly getting orders wrong

From the guest perspective, breakfast is a make-or-break meal. The Fitzwilliam made me want to stop visiting hotels entirely, or to bring my own oatmeal and go out for a proper cup of tea or coffee later. Incidentally, both tea and coffee tasted fine at Irish supermarkets like Supervalu and convenience shops like Spar. There is no excuse for not monitoring the quality of food and drink at breakfast. I fault the management for this, not the servers. 

These are blatant and annoying issues that should shame any hotel. They far outweighed the positives at the Fitzwilliam – the comfortable bed, down pillows and comfortable couches; the location; the reasonable room cleaning and other services. I caution potential guests to adjust their expectations.",2,2016,07,31
204,Didn't quite meet our Expectations for a 5 star Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights Friday and Saturday at this hotel picked due to good location and 5 star status. Our room faced out to St Stephens Green Park but the view of the Tram works going on outside the front of hotel were quite ugly and noisy.  On Friday evening we ordered a basic pizza from Room service at 10.30pm it took 45 minutes to arrive when if finally arrived it was cold so we refused it , they did offer another but at 11.15pm we thought just forget it as it was too late. Our room was ok quite small and the fixtures and fittings could of been in better order also it was so noisy outside we were unable to open our bedroom window having to use the air con which was quite drying. The bar is quite uninspiring for the hotel the only bonus was drinks were no more expensive than anywhere else in Dublin. On Saturday evening our next door neighbours room 304 were so loud banging doors and talking loudly that at 12.15am I decided to call reception I called twice although the noise did go down for a short while it started again at 1am when it woke us up. I know this is not the hotels fault but I've never experienced this in a 5 star Hotel before just rude and inconsiderate. Upon checking out we did address all our concerns with Johnathon one of the Managers who was very nice and did deal with things to our satisfaction. Would we choose this hotel again sorry to probably not very good location and the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful but unfortunately it just didn't live up to its 5 stars I'm afraid.",3,2016,07,31
204,great stay,"booked a superior room and had one on the 4th floor.
The view is really nice and the balcony outside is a nice feature if you want to sit outside first thing in the morning or after a walk around the city (pity that during my stay there was huge road works with consequential noise)

Staff is very friendly and very helpful. 
Concierge was able to book a great restaurant for saturday night with almost no notice, and his suggestion was really good.

Small downside: shower was a big temperamental, not sure if because at the 4th floor the pressure of hot water is not enough or because in that moment lot of people was opening it, but we had few time of burst of cold water while showering.",4,2016,07,30
204,The Best Hotel in Dublin,We booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel through our travel agent and couldn't have been happier.  The rooms are solid and quiet even though it is perfectly located just opposite St. Stephen's Green and is just steps away from from a vibrant and interesting shopping and street scene.  We were able to walk to many attractions including Trinity College from here.  Service was impeccable with the traditional Irish charm.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin and neither would my wife.  We hope to return soon.,5,2016,07,30
204,Excellent service and accomodations,Felt immediately welcomed and attended to by the staff.  Allowed us to stay in the hotel lobby until the room was ready for us.  Special thanks to Ray (driver of pickup car at airport) for allowing our cousin to ride with us back to town.  Would stay here again and recommend to others visiting Dublin.  ,5,2016,07,30
204,afternoon Sunday tea,"A gem, booked on line.A very unusual tea-no bread, no sandwiches. Savory choice -various bits such as asparagus, tiny salads, cheese, wantons
Scones delicious as were the macaroons, opera cake, choux buns
In the price was tea but also a cocktail that was delicious.
Check menu as contains fish/shellfish. However they give alternatives if pre warned.
Staff were lovely

204,2 Night stay,"Stayed last weekend on an organised package . From arriving until we checked out was an absolute perfect stay . Friendly staff , luxurious rooms , beautiful full Irish breakfast in the mornings !! Perfect location at the top of Grafton Street next to a park. 
Would definitely stay here again ...Thank you for a wonderful stay .",5,2016,07,27
204,Our time at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin,"We love the hotel itself. However, we had a group with us and had made a dinner reservation earlier which was confirmed, but when we got to the hotel they could find no record of it. It was a Saturday night and we were told the dining room was full for the evening. They did eventually seat us and half the tables were empty and the food was a six on a scale of ten. That said, the staff and especially the waiters were all very friendly and service was good. The hotel is very convenient to downtown and there are excellent restaurants nearby. Confirm and reconfirm reservations!",4,2016,07,26
204,our Dublin hotel for the past 5 years,"perfect location, extremely helpful concierge team (love you Patrick:)), good value for money. to bad the bar next-door got closed (wink). if you do not see the reason to waste your money on Merrion, please look into Fitzwilliam. I go there every year for my birthday(May), I get a birthday cupcake at breakfast without asking for it and this year we stayed 3 days here and moved for 2 nights in Marfield house. I shed a couple of tears when I saw that a bottle of wine and a letter from Fitzwilliam concierge was waiting for me there. I can hardly wait for next year!!!",5,2016,07,26
204,Perfect,The hotel Fitzwilliam is a luxury hotel. You are greeted by a doorman who is very friendly. We arrived early and though our room was not ready they secured our luggage while we walked around Dublin. Upon our return they had brought the luggage to our rooms. The rooms were very upscale. We stayed in 3 other hotels during our time in Ireland but they had the most comfortable beds!! I would have to rate this hotel a 10!!!,5,2016,07,25
204,Excellent Hotel,This was our first visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin & from the moment of arrival  it was a five star experience. The friendship of the staff was excellent nothing was to much trouble.Our room was a family one as we like a lot of space & it didn't disappoint. We loved having the bath & shower separate & the power shower was brilliant. Breakfast in the Citeron restaurant was amazing  with a wonderful choice of hot & cold foods. We had a wonderful stay & can't wait to go back again next year. Well done!,5,2016,07,25
204,What a lovely stay,"Me and my daughter stayed here for my birthday treat. We arrived very early on our first day, and decided to take a chance and ask reception if our room was ready. It wasn't but we were able to store our luggage with the concierge and go for a stroll along Grafton Street. The hotel kindly called when our room was available, and the chap on reception took us up to our room. It was bliss to be able to get in early and relax!

The room was a good size and overlooked a courtyard. The bath was huge - I'm quite tall and could lay down full length in it easily. Nice range of toiletries supplied and lovely fluffy robes to wrap ourselves in, along with a pair of slippers for our tired feet.

Little touches mean a lot; when we got back to the hotel to change for our evening event, not only was there a little box of chocolates on the bed - and the bed had been turned down - but there was another box on the side with a card wishing me a happy birthday. Very nice!

Breakfast was OK on the first morning, although the bacon had been standing under a heater for too long and was quite tough. I mentioned it to the waiter, and on the second morning the same waiter served my full Irish with a smile and perfectly cooked bacon.

A fab hotel with truly lovely staff. What a birthday treat!",5,2016,07,25
204,Amazing hotel,"Stayed there for a weekend away for an early birthday celebration, on arrival we were met at the door by the concierge who took our bags and offered to park our car, checking in was very swift and friendly, the rooms were of very good standard, really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return, thank you for a lovely stay ",5,2016,07,25
204,Another great stay at the Fitzwilliam,"This is my regular location in Dublin but first time with the family.  As usual, it met expectations.  Rooms are good size and clean.  Breakfast option was enjoyed by all.  It is a great location for lots of good activities.  The standout this time was the service level, especially from the concierge team.  We were a large group and they were incredibly helpful on a number of different things.  That level of service makes things go so much smoother.  Well done again.",5,2016,07,24
204,Golf Trip - 16 friends.,This is a great central Dublin hotel. Good rooms and a very good breakfast served. Also great porters for luggage who actually arrived quickly and were friendly. We played 2 golf courses in Dublin and the unique shower in the bathrooms were like a hot massage at the end of the day. Great place to stay.,5,2016,07,24
204,Great location but rooms were small,"Very courteous staff.  Location is right across from St. Stephens Green and within walking distance to many locations.  Armed with a map, I was able to make my way back from St. Patrick's Cathedral in about 20 minutes.  The Gaity Theatre was right around the corner and I was able to see Riverdance.  I never knew that feet could fly!!",4,2016,07,23
204,"Nice friendly, clean hotel & conveniently located in the city","Great place to stay when in Dublin. It is within easy walking distance to city sites and just around corner from the sight-seeing bus (Stephen's Green) to sites a little farther away. The staff was helpful & friendly and even one employee, Paulino showed us to our room & described how thing worked, etc & tips for seeing the city, she remembered our name & came to wish us good-bye when we left (3 days/nights). I hope I remembered her name correctly because she was the hotel's great ambassador! We enjoyed our comfortable stay there.",4,2016,07,21
204,"Great Room, Great Location","Our room was amazing and the bathroom even better. There was amble space for the two of us, and the bathroom was huge. The bed was comfortable, and our room faced the courtyard so it was quite peaceful. The breakfast was ok for the price.",4,2016,07,14
204,Great location,"This hotel is in a perfect location, right at the St. Stephens Green and in the center of town.  Rooms are great too. If here on business without companions for the Grafton Street pubs, Tom and Luke in the hotel bar will make you feel a local hanging at the pub.  ",5,2016,07,13
204,"Really good, traditional hotel in city center","Nicely built, old and traditional 5 star hotel right in the heart of the city. Next to Grafton street and St. Stephen's garden. Walking distance to majority of the attractions. 

Rooms were neat, not too spacious but not too small. Have all the amenities and services. Staff was extremely polite and helpful throughout. Special mention for the service quality.",4,2016,07,12
204,Very good city centre hotel,"Good location - very well positioned in the middle of things and within walking distance of major attractions. Really comfy bed. Terrific breakfast. Concierge really helpful. What's not to like? Oh and Dublin was great fun. 
",5,2016,07,11
204,Visitor comes first,"The last week in June my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting Dublin and to double that pleasure we stayed at the Fitzwilliam. Upon entering, a smiling member of the staff took my hand, asked my name and expressed his desire that we enjoy our time in Dublin. For all he knew, we might have simply walked in to ask directions.
It doesn't stop there; professional courtesy, service comfort, cleanliness and the simple act of greeting with a smile is given by all. Special thanks to Ursula at the Fitness Center, you gave my wife a massage that made her day. 

Thanks,
Al Hammond",5,2016,07,11
204,Getting worn,"No Irish staff on the front desk, disappointing since it was mostly tourists staying here. They couldn't understand my (Irish) accent. The room was very worn - holes in the carpet, damaged furniture - not the standard you would expect in a 5 star hotel. Get a double room as the twin was two singles pushed together! On the plus side the breakfast was exceptional and the hotel is in a fantastic location.",3,2016,07,10
204,Beautiful and comfortable,"This hotel is in a great location, near St Stephens Green and all the shopping. Short walk to Temple Bar as well. Beautifully decorated, great service, comfortable beds. The main two things that stood out to me were the amazing water pressure in the shower and the quantity and variety of outlets. They even have one for an american plug incase you forgot your adaptor. Also, free wifi!",5,2016,07,09
204,Birthday treat,"First visit to Dublin for a birthday treat. We arrived early but did ask for an early check in, didn't have to wait too long for the room to be ready. The hotel is in a great position for shopping, and sightseeing. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We went out on the Saturday to eat and down to Temple Bar for few drinks. We had a meal in Citron restaurant on the Sunday and disappointed that several choices were not on the menu which didn't leave us much choice it was okay but not great.
Breakfast was good plenty of hot and cold food.
We had a room overlooking St Stephens Green, room was fine everything we needed. 

Slightly  disappointed we got home my husband told me he had emailed the hotel to inform them it was my birthday and had an email back to say they would let guest relations know to do something but they didn't do anything.",4,2016,07,09
204,"Friendly Service, Great Room in a Great Location","Upon checking into the hotel, we were greeted by a lovely young lady at the front-desk who showed us to our room, explained the workings of the hotel to us, and overall was very kind and inviting. Made for a very nice welcome. The rooms are nicely decorated and all equipped with an umbrella which is great given the weather in dublin. Located across the street (under construction) from St. Stephens Green which is a must visit for a walk through. Centrally located, this is an excellent hotel that is a must visit if looking for luxury in Dublin!",5,2016,07,09
204,Check out the hotel bar,"My family stayed in 2 rooms for a total of 2 nights. There was a lot of construction around the hotel because they are putting in a new railway, but we never heard it in our rooms. The hotel is a quick walk to so many pubs, restaurants, shopping, and landmarks. We added the breakfast onto our bill so we did not have to go out and find a breakfast spot each morning. The breakfast was good, but nothing stood out as amazing. Continental breakfast was offered with ability to order Irish breakfast, traditional pancake (like a crepe), porridge, etc. All the food was pretty good. The Inn on the Green (bar) was great. We enjoyed coming here each evening to have a couple drinks before bed. The bartenders were knowledgeable and made excellent drinks. We felt well taken care of during our stay. I do feel the hotel is a bit over-priced, but the quality of service, amenities, and location were worth it!",5,2016,07,09
204,"Nice Hotel, but not a 5 Star...","We visited Ireland June 20th - July 8th, 2016. Travel Days + 7 Days in Dublin, 7 Days traveling southern and western coast and the final 5 days back in Dublin. Ireland is amazing. So we had booked the  Fitzwilliam for our two time frames in Dublin. 

First I want to say the staff is amazing... Polina checked us in and helped us throughout our visit. Viktor the concierge booked us into 6 different restaurants. As foodies, we found all 6 very good to great.. So this review is not about staff... They were all amazing.

This review is really about the hotel. It is a standard 3 star hotel. The location on St Stephens Greeen is awesome. But, when we walked into the lobby I have to say it does not look like the pictures... It is much smaller. The sleeping rooms were decorated ok, but they are tiny... There were two of us and we found ourselves constantly navigating around the furniture, each other, our luggage while there. The bathroom was exceptionally small. The toilet was literally wedged between the door and a small sink with no counter space. There was a shower stall but, you could not even bend down in the shower to wash your legs and feet without opening the shower door.

The bar and restaurant spaces were underwhelming... Designed with no character and basically purely functional. The food for breakfast was average. 

Though we enjoyed the staff, we opted to cancel the Fitzwilliam and switch to the Westbury for the second leg of our visit... We got a deal on a suite for roughly the same price that we paid at the Fitzwilliam... Our room was huge! (See my review) Great space... Great staff... 

So if you want good value for your money and to stay in a top hotel... I would not recommend the Fitzwilliam.",3,2016,07,09
204,Amazing Hotel!,"This hotel is wonderful!  We didn't even have reservations we just walked in and they gave us there last 4 rooms 2 of which were beautiful suites on the top floor.  Location is perfect right next to the train station, as close to walking distance as possible.

The rooms were perfectly clean, room service and breakfast were both included in the rate.  The staff were so friendly and even arranged rides to the Guinness factory for us, there were 9 of us and we got 2 cabs within 10 minutes.  Definitely not the cheapest hotel around but $350 Euro for a top level suite w/ room service & breakfast included in the center of the city was well worth the splurge for 1 night.  Hotel is 5 stars across the board would highly recommend it!",5,2016,07,07
204,Amazing hotel!,"We were delighted with the Fitzwilliam during our stay last week. We chose it because it was highly recommended on Trip Advisor and it lived up to its high praise. Our room was spacious, beautifully designed and very comfortable. The staff was excellent and always happy to help. The breakfast was excellent. And we loved the location even though there was construction going on in front of the hotel. It was close to everything we were interested in. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2016,07,06
204,"Sumptuous & impeccably clean, but bring your earplugs","Beautifully decorated & comfortable hotel. Some of the best attention-to-detail housekeeping I've ever come across - absolutely impeccable. But the building is n-o-i-s-y: I can only assume it was a cheaper hotel or building made for another purpose that's been aesthetically upgraded. I was in a quiet side-of-building room (so it's not street or reveller noise I'm talking about) - but floor noise from above, door noise from the corridor, squealling plumbing. Sorry, but I won't be back.",2,2016,07,06
204,Overwhelmed by the Friendliness!,"Lucky to find this hotel after another hotel double booked us and had to sleep in the car for the night. Tried to get a room early (7:00 am) and the staff was incredible. Gave us the room and offered breakfast for free when they heard our story. 
Further I had parked in the building and didn't know that the hotel had a special rate for guests so after paying the full fee the hotel deducted the difference. 

After such a treatment and service this is the one and only hotel I will ever consider when going back to Dublin!",5,2016,07,05
204,Excellent choice!!,"This hotel is exceptional. We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. The staff is professional, very warm welcoming and make you feel very important. Great restaurants and service. The rooms are very clean and comfy with efficient house keeping.",5,2016,07,05
204,Never again.  A total misrepresentation.,"Our so-called ""upgrade"" room on the 4th floor of the Hotel Fitzwilliam in Dublin may have faced the park called St. Stephen's Green, but the room itself tiny, and was wholly misrepresented online with tricky photography as a deluxe ""upgrade,"" and very cramped.  How could this room be rented as a queen deluxe “upgrade” when there is no closet, but only a cheap cabinet less than one foot deep, which could only hold a couple of suits or jackets, and maybe a coat.  And, in that ""upgrade"" room, the door cannot even be fully opened when the X-shaped luggage rack is in use with a suitcase on it.  How “upgrade” is that?  You would also find that the ""deluxe"" access to the narrow balcony is simply a joke, even tho the owner calls it ""sizeable.""  You must roll a cheap stool over to the window, climb up on that same stool, contort your body through a hinged window (not even a proper door) to step out onto (what we found was) a loose and unsafe step, onto a minuscule balcony that is barely two feet wide.  We couldn’t even use the balcony owing to the safety issue of a loose step.  The furniture was totally out of scale, over-sized, clunky and uncomfortable with little space for normal walking.	The Queen bed, on one side, was so close to the wall that the gap is barely one foot wide.  There wasn’t even enough room for the porter to bring the room service cart inside, and no table for us to eat from.  Our one room service food meal was inedible, ill-prepared, and sloppily served in an unsanitary manner with no cover, meaning it could have been breathed on or coughed on by anyone from the time it was brought out of the kitchen, up on the elevator and down the hall to us, the sign of an incompetent kitchen staff.  I also will point out that making a 100 Euro holding charge on a guest’s AmEx card at check-in should never be done without prior authorization by that guest, but they did so anyway, greet us at check-in, with a cashier brusquely saying, it’s a charge being made “in case you break something.”  How insulting!!  We did enjoy the breakfasts and breakfast service, and the concierges, but our overall experience was terrible.",1,2016,07,04
204,The best hotel in Dublin,"Everything is stunning every time - the service, the rooms and the location! It is right next to the tram, which is one of the fastest ways to move around in D. Perfect for a business trip or vacation. And the breakfast will leave you speechless! ",5,2016,07,04
204,Great place to stay,"Loved this hotel!! Excellent location within walking distance of everything Dublin has to offer.  Staff was wonderful, rooms are beautiful we stayed in the penthouse on the 6th floor and it was worth the price!!  Would absolutely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,04
204,Great Hotel,Great central location on St. Stephens Green and steps from Grafton Street and walking distance to many fine pubs and eateries.  The St. Stephens Shopping Center is at the corner.  Museums are walking distance and most are free. Rooms are very modern and large.  We are now at a highly rated London hotel and the rooms are half the size.  Staff at the Fitzwilliam is very helpful.  We booked on Costco Travel and had a very good full Irish breakfast included.  We wanted to be close to our daughter so they gave us connecting rooms which we really liked.  Would definitely stay here when in Dublin again.,5,2016,06,30
204,Most amazing staff & Atmosphere ,"Fantastic business stay! 
Got an amazing room on the 6th floor pics of 627.. which had a lovely bathroom with joint shower / bath. 

Enjoyed having extra fancy features like dimmer switch in the bathroom and main room. 

The interior of the hotel all appears very rich and luxurious feel in the corridors bathrooms lobby etc. 

Only minor drawback was the blackout curtains don't completely close but the light didn't bother me / wake me. 

They have excellent staff who are all very polite and offer a high level of customer service. I left an important item behind and all the staff worked together to get me back my item that had been safely stored for me. 
Also they have Barry's Tea!! ",5,2016,06,30
204,Beautiful Hotel,"Very kind and helpful staff. There was a slight mix-up with our room request but they were very obliging and rectified the mistake quickly. The room was a little smaller than expected but the furnishings were unique and everything was spotless. Location is really excellent and although the hotel is quite modern, it is still cosy and warm. Not exactly the warmth of the Westbury but would definitely be a second choice in Dublin.",5,2016,06,28
204,If your looking for an average hotel in Dublin...,"I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam in downtown Dublin and would say that its a pretty average hotel--not five stars or luxury. When we arrived, there were  a lot of people in the lobby and the staff appeared overwhelmed. Our room wasn't ready so we went upstairs to get breakfast--which was also very crowded for the small area. The rooms were decorated nicely but some areas of the room appeared to look old or worn. The City of Dublin also has a lot of construction currently going on--which was all around the hotel and obstructed the view of the park. If I were to return to Dublin, I'd most likely stay at another hotel.",3,2016,06,28
204,Right at the heart of the city!,"The location is very handy and central. I liked the room, it was very clean and organized. Breakfast choice was plenty, I enjoyed the food. The staff are helpful and friendly. My room was very quiet witj a comfy bed for a good night sleep. I really enjoyed my stay and I definitely suggest this hotel!",5,2016,06,27
204,Awesome Stay!,"Great Hotel in the Heart of Dublin. Awesome staff very helpful and friendly. We will be back! You can walk everywhere.....close to Bars, Pubs, Shopping....etc. Very quiet Room overlooking courtyard very spacious.",5,2016,06,22
204,Delightful central Dublin!,Several nights here and delighted with staff. Rooms are on the small size but usually one is sight-seeing all day. Bathrooms do not vent or have electric outlets per Ireland code. Breakfast is an expensive buffet- a surprise as most European hotels include breakfast- but offers good choices.,5,2016,06,21
204,Service at its best,"Stayed one night.  Everyone on staff was very accommodating and kind.  Bed and pillows very comfy!  I was on the 3rd floor, and the water pressure was unbelievable!  I love when that happens!  Location can't be beat - Right across from St Stevens Green and next to Grafton St shopping and restaurants.",5,2016,06,20
204,In the middle of things but still quite,"We had a room on the 5th floor with a terrace over looking the park. Although there was construction going on in the streets below, it was still quite and peaceful. Service and comfort is to my best satisfaction although the room was a bit small given the price-tag. Nevertheless, if you are looking for an excellent hotel in the middle of Dublin, right where the action starts once you walk out the door, this one is highly recommendable. ",5,2016,06,17
204,Great hotel,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Our room was very clean and fairly roomy. Nice, clean bathroom with a good shower. The service was great. The concierge helped us book daytrips and answered all of our questions. There was free bottled water in our room, although they did not replenish it daily, as promised. Location was perfect right on Stephen's Green and close to shops, restaurants etc. definitely stay here!",5,2016,06,14
204,Excellent location and even better service!!!,"I am a Virtuoso Travel Advisor and visit many 5 star properties on a regular basis. This property is one of my top five favorites... the staff is beyond excellent. They are at your every disposal should you need anything while in town and they truly care about the ""experience"" of each guest, not just a room to stay in. There is a difference. Fergal, Grace and Bronagh (to name a few) go above and beyond to make The Fitzwilliam extra-spectacular! The rooms overlooking the park have a fabulous view, the breakfast is fantastic, The restaurant is a culinary experience in and of itself (if you are a foodie, this is a MUST!) and the afternoon tea is the best you will find anywhere, hands down. Their sales staff knows no limits and is there to provide the best for each guest that walks through their front door. I cannot recommend this place enough!!  Choose it for the location, love it for everything else!",5,2016,06,09
204,Staff Excellent,"Excellent time this was our 3rd time staying here and all been excellent.
Our room was spotless and very comfortable,shower also excellent,only down side was we ordered breakfast to our which was delivered on time but food wasn't up to standard.",5,2016,06,06
204,...of all my travels....,"I travel all over the world for my business & this has been my second trip in 6 months to Dublin; I chose the fitzwilliam hotel because I wanted to host dinner meetings at the Michelin star Thornton's. I am still raving about my stay at the hotel. Thornton's was simply magnificent; the passion of Chef Kevin Thornton is so contagious, you cannot but sit back and enjoy the culinary delights. The room which we had was spacious but had a number of imperfections. It was such a joy that within 24 hours, everything was sorted out. The concierges are among the best I have ever experienced anywhere in the world.. and I am lucky to have stayed in a number of iconic and world famous hotels. The hotel Resident manager, the Guest Relations Manager were just fabulous in demonstrating genuine sense of hospitality. The Fitzwilliam is the ONLY hotel I will go to when in Dublin. 
",5,2016,06,05
204,"Excellent service, location and food - who needs more!?","I took some time over this trip because my 83 year old mum was travelling with me, indeed, my Mum was the reason for the trip. The Fitzwilliam was an ideal choice due to its central location and proximity to where my mum was born and grew up. However, it's the staff that make this place 5 star... each and every one made us both feel we were special (unlike some other establishments who seem to think we should be grateful we're allowed to stay). I must mention Lena on the desk, and Alexandra in the restaurant.. Both these women are a credit to the hotel and their profession... They were kind and caring and professional and efficient... Grant too made his presence felt and we appreciated his care and generosity. Together, they made our stay a small joy. This was particularly wonderful for my Mum, who said she felt like the Queen! And I agree... If you want first class service, look no further.

Having read the reviews here, I plumped for the hotel and booked a half-board deal. Our first room didn't have a shower for mum, who can't manage a bath, and we were re-accommodated in a room with both, efficiently and more importantly, graciously... particularly as the hotel was full. Both rooms overlooked the Green and were spacious and fresh. The bathrooms, particularly in the second room, were lovely... Lots of 5 star touches: robes, fresh flowers, complimentary bottled waters. An excellent mini bar helped with the munchies. First class room service too, booked and delivered in 15 minutes.

We ate each night in the Citron Restaurant. Excellent 'fine' wines by the glass, and a good seasonal menu offering a range of  local produce. I particularly liked the fact that on the third night I wanted a simple steak, chips and salad and was cheerfully accommodated... This is, again, what sets this place apart... Nothing seems too much trouble for them. 

As for the breakfasts... Certainly the best I have had in such a large (and full) hotel... Thinking about it, probably anywhere...  Pastries, freshly squeezed juices (including vegetable  'juice of the day'), Continental cheeses, hams and meats; cereals, smoothies, a wide range of fresh fruit cocktails, individual fruit compotes, yogurts etc. and then a wide range of hot breakfasts including porridge and kippers... we had the 'Irish' and it didn't disappoint... Behold a kitchen who can make eggs in any form and keep the yolks blurringly soft... Well done.. 

So, all in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. If you're interested in 5 stars, you'll know they aren't a cheap option, but this hotel was worth every euro.",5,2016,06,04
204,Girlie shopping trip to Dublin,"Myself and 3 girls headed to Dublin for a little overnight shopping trip. We got the NIR Railbreak which included 1st class rail from Belfast to Dublin and back with an overnight including breakfast in The Fitzwilliam hotel. We received a lovely welcome at the hotel and despite our early arrival at 10 am our rooms were ready.  We were able to freshen up before hitting the shops!!  We lunched in Deane and Crescenzi on South Fredrick Street a lovely little authentic Italian a little of the beaten track but a real fav. Reenergised after a delightful lunch, more shopping which hit a frenzy when I realised Arnotts had 20% of everything!! Back to the hotel for revival and a cocktail in the bar before heading out to Luna, Drury Street, another Italian oops, hadn't read the menu before, Mega expensive but amazing food. Top tip go for the pre-theatre menu it's 30 euro for 3 courses. We missed this unfortunately and when we got our bill we thought we had bought the restaurant!!! Back to Fitzwilliam for an night-cap before bed and a good nights sleep on comfy beds and crisp white cotton sheets.  Breakfast the next morning was a feast, didn't need to eat the rest of the day yummy pancakes and don't miss the museilli pots.  We finished off our little trip with a visit to some art galleries and a real must to get a few groceries for home in Fallon and Byrne, Exchequer St also good for lunch but no room after our breakfast.  Sadly time for home, bye bye Fitzwilliam and all your lovely staff time for train back to Belfast. What a lovely 36 hours!!",5,2016,06,02
204,So many favors of trainwreck,"It's remarkable how many things went wrong in a mere 16 hours - considering at least 9 of those I spent sleeping.

There was no one at the door when I arrived and was left with the option of leaving my stuff on the street in Dublin or trying to wrestle in the heavy doors myself; I opted for the latter which resulted in me getting hung up on the door and ripping a bag containing a rug I'd purchased.  And yes I got inside to see the concierges goofing off.  

Keep in mind that the room costs approximately $600 US a night.

The room was on the 6th floor, but the elevator only goes to the 5th floor then you wind your way up the hallway to find your room.  Sadly it does not come with a map so actually finding my room came with its own challenges of walking the 5th floor like a lost tourist looking for the stairs.

The hotel bills itself as a ""style"" hotel, but chipped, broken and in need of repair is the best way to describe it.  The sink was cracked, the desk wrecked by water stains, the tiles chipped and buckling, and the pretty ugly portrait on the wall crooked and the frame broken.  It seems like it's trying to compete with a W hotel but oh man does it miss the mark.

The service was the most chaotic.  First, they agreed to give me a late check out, and I really appreciated this gracious gesture.  However, then I get a call asking ""do you plan to actually check out?""  Clearly there was no communication from person a to person b, even though they were standing 4 feet away at the front desk.  The staff apologized for their miscommunication when I checked out, but their special kind of magic continued.

The final, best note of incompetence came when the front desk woman said, ""sorry we can't change any money for you but since you need a cab we will Flag One Down That Takes Credit Cards.""

So she makes a big deal of finding me a cab That Takes Credit Cards and taking some of my luggage, but she apparently forgets to ask if he takes credit cards, unbeknownst to me.  And she doesn't seem to notice that the cab driver wasn't ready to actually take another customer because the driver was waiting for a fare to come back from the bank machine.  It was only after all of my luggage was loaded, and I was sitting in the car for several minutes that I said, ""Sir, are we going to go, I need to catch a train?""

""It'll just be a minute,"" he says.

And then it was longer.  

Only when we eventually drive away does he explain what happened, which was ""the man expected to give me a credit card.""

""I said, Sir, I don't have cash either, you're going to have to let me out.""  He keeps driving.  

""You're going to miss your train,"" he says.  ""Very few cabs in Dublin take credit cards.""

The traffic slows and I open my door to get out and say, ""I need to get out.""

He starts yelling at me for ""slamming"" his door.

It was a train wreck.

I flagged down another cab and made it to Dublin Heuston.

The craziest part is that I paid close to $600 for the room.  Don't make the same mistake I did.

204,Weekend in Dublin for fun and relaxing ,"Spent the weekend in Dublin - visiting the city for the first time. I was traveling solo and in between business trips so wanted someplace centrally located where I would feel safe and also be able to relax. I was willing to spend a bit more than usual but also didn't want to break the bank. This was the perfect choice. 

Location is amazing! On the green. Steps from Grafton street. Dublin is an amazingly walkable city but still I would say this was a really wonderful location. 

Given it was my first time to the city I spent my first morning touring in a 'hop on/hop off' sightseeing bus. The stop for it was half a block from the hotel. Also - the airport city bus - check the hotel web site and they name the precise one - let's you off half a block from the hotel. I didn't take it because I was concerned it would be a long walk or hard to find the hotel and I regret it. Would have been easy and a great way to save about half of the cost of a taxi. 

The staff at the hotel were wonderful. Extremely helpful. Couldn't get me into my room immediately but did get me in ahead of official check in time. They printed some things for me. Stored my bags and gave me directions to happily send me on my way my first day. They also made me a reservation at the restaurant: Thornton's. Molecular gastronomy. Beautiful experience. Exquisite service. Highly recommend it. 

The hotel web site is great. Even has two podcasts with walking tours. I downloaded and listened to them. So fun! 

Gym isn't great to be honest but being on the park and so centrally located, I ran outside instead of working out in the gym so in the end it wasn't a big deal. 

The room wasn't large but was comfortable. Clean. And well appointed. And the bathroom was awesome with a large soaking tub. I even took a bubble bath! 

The furniture has some wear - some scratches on wood surfaces - but honestly everything else really made it the perfect choice for this trip. 

I'd highly recommend this hotel especially for first time visitors to Dublin. Really enjoyed my stay. Fit the bill with everything I needed. ",4,2016,05,28
204,Modern Hotel with little charm,Modern hotel which I frankly would rate alongside a Doubletree or Holiday Inn.  Rooms were fairly small and seating area restricted to a long window bench with rather uncomfortable cushions.  Decent bathroom.  Breakfast area was fine and served a nice buffet and food to order.  There are several more charming hotels to chose from in Dublin at the same price.  I found this place dull.,3,2016,05,28
204,Pleasant stay,"We had a 2 day stay. Clean, fresh and perfectly adequate. Staff were welcoming and efficient. Our room faced St Stephen's Green. Fantastic location. 
Breakfasts were nothing to rave about, this could be improved.",4,2016,05,22
204,Under par!,"Having stayed at the Belfast Fitzwilliam in October 2015 we had high hopes for the Dublin branch, the reception is impressive and the staff are friendly and efficient! The rooms were lovely, it's the bathrooms that let them down, there were a little tired and old fashioned, breakfast was unexceptional - it's a great location but for the price there are other options.",3,2016,05,20
204,Excellent,The hotel and service were excellent. The location is in the centre of Dublin and very close to grafton street. The only issue in the hotel was the Internet. However when I raised the issues the staff were excellent to assist. It's pretty pricey but worth it if you want to treat yourself.,5,2016,05,19
204,Fantastic location and fabulous staff,"We loved our stay here. Not only was the location amazing but the staff, and especially the conceirge were fabulous! We would stop by the conceirge desk each morning and they would give us wonderful ideas of things to try in the area or while we were driving about. Then in the evening we would stop in for a local recommendation of where to eat. We were never sent anywhere we didn't love. One pub we were sent to still remains as some of the best food we had on our entire holiday!",5,2016,05,18
204,Business hotel right in the center,"Comfortable nicely decorated room, great service, very tiny gym. Very small breakfast room (really small), but great variety and quality of food. Location is right in the center.  Great for business or city break. Friendly and well trained staff.
Highly recommended.",4,2016,05,18
204,Beautiful place right in city center,"Great food, courteous staff and gorgeous rooms. Loved our soaker tub and view of the park. You can walk right out your door to grafton street - no need for a car. About 10-15 walk to Trinity College also.They will take good care of you.",5,2016,05,17
204,Let down by untrusting check in 'welcome' and breakfast ,"Lovely position and excellent rooms.  Good power shower and plenty of shelf space in bathroom. However not a drawer in sight for shirts etc. Why not? Kind of basic hotel requirement. Separate radio which was a nice touch.  Ask for rooms in the centre of the hotel overlooking the garden.  Avoid the street side as I expect that it would be noisy. 
Hall Porters excellent and very helpful.  
The bad news was the greeting on arrival, to be told that before we could given our room it is their policy is to take prepayment for the room and 100 euro for extras. Made it feel like all their guests were potentially dishonest and likely to leave without paying. When quizzed about this the only response from the reception  was 'it's hotel policy' and the staff were not able to/interested to see the situation from the guest side. Hotel policy was mentioned again. Left a bad taste for a five star hotel. The other disaster was breakfast. Never have we had such a bad experience at breakfast. Everything that could go wrong did. The saving grace was the Manager, Kevin, who did what he could to put matters right but still inexcusable in such a 'high standard' hotel. Take care should you wish to stay there. ",4,2016,05,15
204,Perfection,"From the moment we booked this hotel, and through checkout, nothing was left to be desired. Extremely friendly service in every detail. Our small room was very comfortable, and being that we like our room to be very cool at night, we were so happy that the air conditioning worked well. Upon check-in we were early, and the staff efficiently served us tea and coffee while we waited just a short time. Breakfast each morning was served promptly and efficiently and came complete with a variety on the buffet, along with wonderful choices from the menu, all included.  Our 3 night stay was perfection! Absolutely the most customer-satisfaction-oriented hotel we could ask for! Hope we can return as we depart Ireland next week! The location is ideal. The room clean. The staff welcoming. ",5,2016,05,14
204,"Chic, contemporary, memorable stay in a historic city","We recently stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel and we were simply soaked in luxury the entire stay.  The room was just astoundingly beautiful, threaded with touches of purple, we were pleasantly surprised to have had a balcony with a heater that overlooked St. Stephen's green.  The balcony became a lovely respite late at night after a great day exploring all that Dublin has to offer. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, and the staff was just amazing!  We will definitely stay here again, and I'm sure it won't be too long until we return.  We've traveled to Ireland 3 times in the past 6 years, and our last visit was September of last year.  We love our time in Ireland.

My husband and I have to give a very special and HUGE thank you to Dean, the Concierge, and Dermott, our Taxi Driver.  We had the misfortune of leaving our backpack in Dermott's taxi, and we discovered this loss after we were 3 hours from Dublin on the West Coast in Clifden.  The backpack had our passport and an iPad in it!  Losing these would have really ruined our holiday.  While I was feverishly trying to determine the awful process of getting a temporary passport, my husband called the Fitzwilliam and was connected with Dean.  He immediately helped us, reached over to Dermott (our cab driver) who was kindly protecting and keeping our belongings safe until we resurfaced.  They both connected to keep our items at the hotel until we could get back to Dublin.  Thank you both and bless you for your kindness! 

Again, loved this hotel and all of our experiences with it!  We will definitely return!",5,2016,05,14
204,Great location and services,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. 
Location wise it is perfect as it is right on the Stephens green square. 
It is facing the park and there is a courtyard for the other rooms to look onto. 
The reception is very well positioned.  Its staff are very good. The concierge is quite good and efficient. 
Housekeeping are good. 
Breakfast is lovely with good choices of cold and hot food. 
Rooms are nicely decorated and of good size",5,2016,05,13
204,Oops slip down scale to sub par,"As a very frequent traveler, I view my patronage at hotels as a partnership, often I know much of the staff by name.   I recommend, send guests, dine in and return.   In exchange I do hope, when in need the hotel will make a modicum of effort.   The Fitzwilliam did not. 

After a long day,  I came in exhausted, late and ordered room service and hoped on to a conference call.   Mobile was at 7% and I'd left my charger at the office. Doh....A Quick call to the front desk and one of the staff said no problem we will send on up.  Splendid.  Sorted.   Thank you Fitzwilliam..Not.   

Hop on the call at then my battery dwindled 7%...6%....5%....4%.... Still no charger.   I pop downstairs to pickup the waylaid charger to be told by the concierge, ""We don't lend chargers to guest."" Dinner now getting cold and call in hand....I ask the front desk who had offer the charger for assistance,  they said they could not help. Concierge relented and gave me what he said was the only house charger.   Back to room at 1% plugged.... in safe....

Oh no, not so easy at the Fitzwilliam.  Still on call, recovered to 5% about, 10 mins later and house phone rings....""could you bring charger back.""   Stuff it. Much to do about nothing, clearly I am way out of line asking the Fitzwilliam staff for a favor.   I abandon my conference call, as the greater demons are working against me to have a undisturbed  call.   I take the charger down stair and the concierge now tells me to keep it.    

Next morning at breakfast I ask for a charge at the desk at which point the scarce  single charger now turns into two discrete, individual and unused chargers.  

The desk clerk tell me that he did not want to lend as this is personal property.  

I come in the next evening and have a kind note of apology and boxed up the house charger, aka clerks personal property as a gift.  The last thing I want is to take a house charger or an employees personal property.     

At the rates the Fitzwilliam charges I would expect customer service to be better than a travel-lodge.   Twice I asked the front desk for assistance and twice I had someone at the front desk tell me, ""what would you want me do or Seems like you made a decision so their is nothing I can do "".   The City West sells chargers to guest....

I know this is a true first world gripe,  but I went from feeling like a was a welcomed frequent guest to be being just another punter and a bother to a pleasantly bored staff. I have left the gifted charger at the front desk with the unhelpful night manager.   Hopefully they will make it available to another guest in need.   

The Clayton has raised its game, has newer rooms, has better price point and has a helpful front desk.   ",1,2016,05,13
204,Perfect hotel with amazing staff!,I spent a week recently at the Fitzwilliam and the hotel staff made the stay absolutely wonderful! Tomas and Craig took care to provide excellent service and on point recommendations for things to see and do while in Dublin. I will definitely be making the Fitzwilliam my home for future stays in Dublin.,5,2016,05,11
204,Excellent hotel,"great location staff so polite and considerate very helpful.  i have mobility issues and they did accommodate me.  while i was waiting in the lobby for my taxi they asked me if i needed anything. i said a glass of water, please.  they brought it wow",5,2016,05,10
204,Business trip,"Friendly, attentive staff, excellent customer service. Guillermo was amazing( Concierge) as well as the rest of the staff. Breakfast staff was also ready to greet you with a smile. the only thing that did disappoint is the scramble eggs and omelette. It's really unfortunate the cook/chef cannot cook an omelette!! really bad. He could learn from a you tube video/ cuisine.  I may sound harsh but it doe not match the rest of quality being offered in the hotel.",5,2016,05,09
204,Put this hotel on your priority list ,"Fabulous room, bathroom, staff and great lounge to sit in.  This hotel oozes quality and professionalism.  Reputation for  attentive service is well deserved.  A very authentic hotel with a genuine desire from staff to go the extra mile for you.",5,2016,05,07
204,"Great service, well appointed rooms","We spent two nights at the Fitzwilliam March and had amazing service from all of the staff, nothing was too much trouble. Our room was very comfortable and we enjoyed the breakfast on both days.  Fabulous cocktails in the bar with some live music thrown in for a real treat.",5,2016,05,05
204,Great location,"Great location, but trying too hard to be trendy. The lobby was loud and busy and not somewhere you would want to hang out for a coffee. My room was on the 6th floor, but the elevator only goes to the 5th floor, so you have to carry your bags up a flight of stairs. I had the equivalent of a carry-on bag, so no big deal; but for someone with a lot of luggage, or a disability - kind of crazy.  The room was nice, attic style, with bright furnishings, facing the courtyard - so was quiet, but it was very small for a 5 star hotel. The check-in staff were friendly, welcoming, and helpful, as were the doormen, it just didn't all stack up to what one would expect from a 5 star hotel.",3,2016,05,03
204,lovely hotel!,"stayed here for a couple of days around new years eve, friendly and very helpful staff, breakfast was excellent although we didn't get to sample any of the evening menu's as we dined out for the duration of our stay.. excellent room too just the place to kick back and relax after a hard night on the town ;)",5,2016,05,02
204,Excellent stay,We stayed here for one night during the bank holiday weekend.  It was a most enjoyable stay from start to finish.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The cocktails from the bar were delicious!!  The hotel is in a perfect location for a lovely break in Dublin.,5,2016,05,02
204,wonderful hotel,"CLEAN, spacious rooms, excellent service. Will stay again. Front desk and concierge service was top notch. Bedding and linens were clean and fresh. I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the rooms and on my second stay was upgraded to a room overlooking St. Stephens. Wonderful experience. ",5,2016,05,02
204,Super,Stayed here with my wife for the cancelled ELO concert on my birthday. Warmly greeted at reception and indeed nearly all the staff we met were very pleasant. Our room was on the 5th floor and very well equiped with facilities you would expect for the price paid. I was a little disappointed that we faced directly across from other buildings meaning we had to have curtains closed. The breakfast buffet was good value at 15 euros featuring a huge selection and freshly cooked options to order. I did find it slightly difficult to regulate the temperature in the room but a minor quibble. All in all a really pleasant stay with excellent customer service.,5,2016,05,02
204,Hotel with Character and Charm,"I spent a single night at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin. My stay included a breakfast as well. I found the hotel to be a standout in terms of the friendliness of the staff, the location, and the choices for Breakfast. 
The rooms are very traditional with loads of wooden panels cabinets filled with assorted with Hotel accoutrements such as mini-bar, safe, closets, etc. Unlike all the ultra modern minimalist hotels of other EU members, my room has a huge bathtub with shower, and excellent lighting integrated into the mirror. 
I loved the bar near the lobby. I was able to get a Guinness, properly poured, and with a clover drawn in the foam.",5,2016,05,02
204,Central but certainly not tacky,"As the hotel is smack bang in the middle of the action on St Stephens Green, you could imagine that the hotel would be full if stag and hen parties (like the rest of Dublin) but thankfully not.
From the moment I stepped in the reception was well appointed and the Staff polite and impeccably well turned out.
Marie on the reception was extremely helpful and even took me up to my room to show me how everything worked.
Room was large and the bed was comfortable. I had a great nights sleep.
Bar was also good. Great staff and an eclectic mix of customers, from golfers from the US to older couples enjoying a romantic weekend away.
All in all, a lovely hotel that I would certainly revisit.",5,2016,05,02
204,great hotel everythink you need,won acomppetion with 20 other people were put up in the the fitzpatrick hotel was every think you dreamed about in aluxuary magazinestaff were friendly nothing too much trouble the breakfast was everythink you needed to start your day off so much to choose from,5,2016,04,30
204,Very happy,"I stayed in room 301, which has a view of the square. Having read other reviews, I was concerned about noise so I mentioned this to the front desk when I checked in. The from desk said it shouldn't be an issue, but if any noise bothered me, they'd be happy to move me. I tried the room and had no issues with noise. If you were to sleep with the windows open, they'd you'd have a LOT of noise. I sleep with the windows closed and had none. The most I could hear was a faint sound of the luas (tram) occasionally, but it was so faint I had to carefully listen for it. The windows are very thick and it's well insulated for noise. If you are ultra sensitive to noise, then ask for a garden view room.

Two of my big concerns anytime I stay at a hotel are bed comfort and shower pressue being decent to get a good shower. The bed was quite comfortable and I slept well. The shower had a rain shower head, so not amazing pressure there, but good enough to take a shower. The bottom faucets could also be switched to a hand held shower head and the pressure there was intense. I was happy with both.

Location of the hotel is fantastic. Immediately out front is the Luas (tram) heading south. There's actually a lot of construction in the area right now because they are merging the north and south trams, which will put the hotel pretty much dead center. Fantastic for exploring Dublin. Nearby is also the Temple Bar area, which is a popular tourist exploration and eating area. Certainly no shortage of places to eat. Almost immediately next door is also a small multi-level mall, so any supplies are quick to find as well. Just past the mall are rows of stores for shopping.

Across the street is St Stephen's Green. It's a very nice park and pleasant stroll.

Breakfast: You have the option of continental breakfast or a full hot breakfast. The continental breakfast has a nice number of options, plenty of fruit, juices, and breads.The hot breakfast options are smaller, but there's a good variety. My hotel package included both and I was satisfied. I ate at the restaurant for dinner once. The dinner was not amazing, but satisfactory. I chose to eat dinner elsewhere the rest of the time because there are tons of options.

Any questions I asked were promptly met with a reply and as much assistance as possible. The only time I was steered wrong, I asked one of the door men how to use the Luas. I was confused when to badge and he said only when exiting the Luas. This is actually incorrect, you have to badge when you get on and then badge when you exit as well. I bought a weekly visitor pass since I'd be riding it every day and it was worth the money. Sometimes the passes are paper, in which case you don't badge. I'm not going to hold this against the hotel since it's not their service, but information should be accurate since you can get in trouble/fined for not badging properly.

Wifi was free. You had to authenticate every 24 hours on every device. Minor annoyance, but the wifi worked quite well.

If I were exploring Dublin, I would gladly stay at this hotel again.",5,2016,04,29
204,Nice hotel,"Very nice welcome by staff, receptionist went out of her way to give us lots of information, Also recieved an upgrade which was fantastic.
The room was very comfortable, had a balcony too overlooking the park. Lovely bedding and comfortable bed and pillows.  Nice bathroom with lots of hot water, rebes and slippers.
Breakfast was lovely I had an omlette, they went out of there way to get you what you wanted.
Overall a very good experience, would return.

Only thing was a bit of noise from the next rooms shower.",4,2016,04,29
204,"Great hotel, centrally located","This is a very nice hotel, located right on St. Stephens Green.  The location makes it easy to walk to anywhere in the city easily.  Guillermo at the Concierge desk was extremelly helpfull with very good recommendations.   

Highly recommended for pleasure or business trips. ",5,2016,04,28
204,It's true.  Great staff!,"I went out to get an early morning Starbucks, returning with my hands occupied.  The butler not only opened the door for me, but then ran (literally) passed and ahed of me to hit the elevator call button and then press my floor.  That just doesn't usually happen, but that's what the service here is like!!",5,2016,04,25
204,You won't be disappointed but avoid the top floor,"The location is great, the service excellent. Rooms are not the biggest but very comfortable. Breakfast is really good, wonderful juices and sausages! Our only complaint was about our room. We asked if we could check in mid morning so we were very happy to be given a room well before the usual check-in time. However, the room was on the top floor and during the night we were woken up by a lot of noise, felt like a vibration. We called reception at 3.45am and within 10 minutes the noise had ceased. Seems that it was an air conditioning fan on the roof. Our room was changed next morning and after that we had no problems at all. Shame that this issue prevents me from giving 5 circles.",4,2016,04,25
204,You'll need nothing else from a 5 star hotel!!,Where do I begin... Rooms decor is moderne and fresh. Breakfast room is 5🌟quality. Whether your an irish fry up or a healthy granola person there's something for everyone here. BUT what makes this hotel somewhere worth visiting is their highly trained extremely courteous and friendly staff. Well done to all👏👏👏 I will be returning here...,5,2016,04,25
204,Fitzwilliam Lovely Hotel,"Our first impression of this hotel. Was warm, friendly staff that are willing to assist day or night. We did a 12 day tour and this hotel was at the end of our vacation. I have to say it was very welcoming. Some of the other hotels we stayed in were pretty, but just not as comfortable. We stayed here only a few days and had a great experience. Beds are very comfortable and you are in the center of everything with-in a short walk. When I'm back in Dublin, I will be back.",5,2016,04,24
204,Fantastic location!,"This is one of the best locations in Dublin, so central to everything! 
There is valet parking so you just arrive and hand over the keys! 
The staff are very friendly too!
We had dinner in the restaurant only €38 for four courses, I had the crab and fillet steak! 
We stayed in a standard room, huge bath too!
Only problem was we got breakfast to the room but had to have it on the bed! 
",5,2016,04,24
204,Superb location and superb staff,"We have just spent 6 nights at this lovely hotel. Our first time in Dublin and we found it to be the perfect location. All the staff we came into contact with were friendly and professional , but there were several staff members that we had more to do with that made our experience in the hotel, and in and around Dublin, a better one. Thankyou to Kevin, Gosia, Heather and Craig for your warm greetings, attentive service and great recommendations for tours and activities- these suggestions enhanced our Dublin experience enormously , for which we are very grateful. We will recommend you to our friends back in Melbourne - and we hope to get back in the future.",5,2016,04,21
204,Lovely location and surroundings,"Visited a couple of weeks back with my mother and loved it here. 

The check in and concierge staff were amazing and so helpful.
The rooms were spacious and spotless, I was especially impressed with the soundproofing as we were facing out onto the busy street below and couldn't hear a thing. 

The restaurant was being refurbished which was a shame but the hotel had done a great job of creating a makeshift breakfast room in a function room downstairs. 

Would love to return! ",5,2016,04,21
204,Will return ,"First time staying here and well impressed from start to finish. Valet parking and concierge very prompt and very welcoming, check in staff likewise, real 5 star service without being OTT. Room was nice, bit on the small side but modern and clean, think the addition of a Nespresso machine to the rooms would really complement them as the tea/coffee facilities are a tad out dated for this type of hotel.

",4,2016,04,20
204,Faultless Fitzwilliam,"Our 3 day stay was a celebration of a friends special birthday, the staff at Fitzwilliam were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are spacious, tastefully decorated and beds were super comfortable. Breakfast menu was comprehensive and very well cooked and staff friendly and informative. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel",5,2016,04,20
204,Nice enough but rather sterile,"We stayed here for a weekend. We booked it as it was a great location and close to the areas we visited.  The rooms were comfortable, well appointed and we both slept very well.

I've always found the Irish a very friendly bunch, however the staff here had an aloofness and weren't terribly friendly.  I appreciate that hotels of this standing are expected to be professional but the lack of friendliness compromised our stay.  In my opinion they haven't got that balance right.

I'd recommend it on facilities, style and comfort but not if you're looking for the Irish charm.",4,2016,04,20
204,Super friendly,"What a great place. Went for a friend's 50th and would love to go back. So convenient for most of Dublin's city centre, within walking distance of major attractions. Staff were always pleased to help and gave us great tips, from restaurants to how to get around. The bed was so comfortable, it was really hard to get up. But the great breakfast was always a good incentive.",5,2016,04,19
204,SUPER Hotel in Dublin,"Getting off a long, unpleasant overnight flight from the States -- arriving in Dublin in the rain on a Sunday morning -- our trip quickly made a 180-degree turn the moment we walked into the Fitzwilliam and were warmly greeted by the superb staff.  Our room was ready and was a real treat -- smartly furnished and comfortable.  We had a room on the third floor with a small balcony and a great view of St. Stephen's Green.  We were given a tasty hot breakfast -- and everyone could not have been friendlier.  We've stayed in many great hotels around the world, and the staff at the Fitzwilliam really cares about the guests and goes the extra mile to make sure that everything is done perfectly.  The hotel location couldn't be better -- a short walk to Trinity College, shopping and the sights.  The Hairy Lemon, a fun pub, is also a short distance away and worth a visit and a pint.  The Fitzwilliam made our stay in Dublin memorable.",5,2016,04,17
204,"Comfortable, convenient and hospitable","This is well located on St Stephen's Green, close to the centre, taxis and trams. The staff here are very polite and helpful. The room, whilst not large, was clean and comfortable, and looked out onto a peaceful garden. The breakfasts are varied and generous. To be recommended.",4,2016,04,17
204,Great location and service,"The hotel was in a great location and we walked to all areas of interest. If you are not up for walking, the taxi ride would not be far. The service was impeccable with all the staff members very helpful and friendly.  Their are umbrellas in the room and lobby for guests to use if you don't have one. If you need extra water in your room you can also get some for free at the bar.  Our refrigerator was not consistently restocked so this was helpful. The mineral water is the one thing that is free. Please be aware that the website states that you can exchange money, but you are limited to $100 a day per room.  If you need money sooner do not wait until you check in.  Exchange some money at the airport. Did not eat at restaurant or go to the hotel bar so I cannot comment.  The bar definitely does not look Irish. It's more modern. Again, I would recommend this hotel just be aware of the few small things I noted. I would definitely return. ",5,2016,04,14
204,"great location, good service","The Fitzwilliam could;t be in a better location--facing St. Stephen's Green, within walking distance of everything in downtown Dublin.  Very friendly and helpful staff, nice lobby bar, great breakfast.  Room was modest sized, but nicely done in contemporary style.",4,2016,04,12
204,Afternoon Tea,"Stunning.
Brought my mother here for a ""different"" type of tea; as in not the traditional finger sandwiches etc...
Range of teas fantastic.
Food was gorgeous and, yes, very different.
Choice of cocktails included; try both!
Staff are really lovely.
The Fitzwilliam had its own aesthetic, which is also quite different; quite avant garde.
Will definitely be recommending & returning for this experience.",5,2016,04,12
204,5 STAR GEM,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is not only an upscale hotel w/great location in the heart of Dublin, but should be commended on their outstanding customer service...From start to finish, the employees at The Fitzwilliams were kind, courteous and extremely helpful in my daily planning during my stay there....In particular, Dane and Patrick...the best!",5,2016,04,09
204,Great Jazz & night out!,"We visited the hotel bar on a Saturday night at the end of March, and we had a great night. They had some lovely non intrusive live jazz music which suited the 5 star venue just perfect. We were served at the bar counter by a friendly bartender (Matt) who helped us choose a great wine, Gecko Ridge, an easy drinking fruit driven red. All in all a great experience and the service was a credit to the bar manager and team there, we will certainly return.",5,2016,04,09
204,Honeymooning at the Fitzwilliam,"My husband and I got to stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel for a few nights during our honeymoon. Everything was wonderful! Amazing service from friendly, helpful people. Felt spoiled. Good food. Rooms were lovely, quite enjoyed the bath. Comfy beds, quite warm. The area was great, near all. Can walk to shopping, food, museums, transportation. Across from beautiful park, St. Stephen's Green. Would love to stay again. ",5,2016,04,08
204,Ageing!,Great location. Little bit impersonal throughout. Rooms are clean - but small. Very thin walls - so you hear every little move both sides of your own room . Needs a facelift too. Breakfast is ok - but nothing special and the bar area is pretty dead. ,3,2016,04,08
204,Fab Hotel,"Recently had an overnight in this lovely hotel.   We were going to the Adele Concert in the 3 Arena and as a treat my daughter booked the hotel for us.    We were checked into the hotel very quickly and were taken to our room by the Guest Relations Manager (Grant) who was very courteous and friendly.    The room was really lovely overlooking a very peaceful courtyard.   
After the Concert we returned to the Hotel and had a couple of drinks in the Lounge.   The staff were very pleasant and helpful.    
The Restaurant is really lovely and airy.    The breakfast the next morning was out of this world.   There was plenty of breads and pastries, juices, smoothies and lots on the continental table.     The hot food was really nice too.     On checking out we were offered coffee/tea before our journey, which I thought was a lovely touch.
I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in the City Centre.",5,2016,04,07
204,Very good but not five star,"I have replied directly to the Manager via email expressing my views with no response but I note he does respond to comments on TA, so thought I would try this option.My partner and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam to enjoy the commemorative Easter Weekend, arriving Good Friday, departing Wednesday 30th March.

The purpose of our visit was to celebrate the 100 year rising, the location was perfect for our purpose and the main reason for the choice of hotel.

Generally the hotel is very good, but I’m not sure how it has managed to achieve 5 star status?

We opted for the deluxe Premium room and at a cost of £1681.55 for 5 nights, I have to say I was very disappointed with the room size and in particular the layout, which I found to be very impractical and not what I would expect from a five star establishment. (Room 502). My expectations from the description of the room were much higher, in my experience a room with a four poster bed is usually spacious and palatial.

Observations as follows:

The television was situated in a recess and was impossible to watch from the bed as it was obscured by one of the posts from the four poster bed
There was very little space to maneuver between the bed and the wall which was problematic, particularly during the night if one needed to use the bathroom.
The wardrobe housed the ironing board, iron, safe and trouser press, leaving very little room for hanging any clothing inside, we had to use the doors instead.
To access the balcony was also quite dangerous although the view was very good.
The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was a nice size, if a little dark and when using the shower became very steamy
The room generally I felt was almost a single room and not appropriate for two    grown adults.

The other disappointing factor was the breakfast area and the actual breakfast itself, again not what I would expect to see for a five star hotel. The hot food was not really hot and no variation from day to day, I asked for an omelette one day, very strange mess on a plate appeared. The attentiveness of the staff was very good but quite unorganized.

I visit Dublin on a very regular basis, mainly on business and based on this experience given the actual cost versus value for money and expectation I wouldn’t be recommending the Fitzwilliam.",4,2016,04,07
204,To celebrate the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising,Very good service all around. Outstanding work from Josefina at reception on our final day. The food was very good and all matters were dealt with efficiently. We plan to return for our third stay at the Fitzwilliam the next time we are in Dublin.,4,2016,04,06
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel bar,"The Fitzwilliam is one of our favourite hotels. We've stayed several times in recent years (usually with the children) and have nothing but good things to say about it. This time (Mar 2016) we just popped into the bar for some early-evening food. We had tried the Shelbourne first but it was bursting at the seams (great if you're up for a lively night but just not what we were looking for), in comparison the Fitz was just right.

The food was very good and reasonably priced. The staff are always very professional yet relaxed and the bar area itself was calm and comfortable.

There's not much more to be said - it's a great option to think about if you're looking for somewhere a little bit different to eat in the Grafton Street area.",5,2016,04,06
204,Luxury boutique style haven in central Dublin,"We stayed here one night on Good Friday as we had a whistle stop visit prior to connecting to the US. The hotel was a real surprise - the room was beautifully designed and appointed with an incredibly comfy bed. Little touches like the mongrammed carpets made the place feel classy.

Breakfast was delicious - great selection. Thank you!",5,2016,04,05
204,5* Service!!,"Location

Perfect. Across from St.Stephen's Green and literally at the top of Grafton street. So many great restaurants and shops within walking distance. There is also a covered shopping centre next door to hotel. Can't beat the location. Taxi from airport is approx. 30 euros. 

Rooms 

We had specifically booked interconnecting rooms, which for reference are at the end of the hallway for what felt like a 1km walk from the lifts! We had water temperatures issues and they had to move us to non-interconnecting rooms, which we were disappointed about but it all worked out. The rooms are pretty modern with a super comfortable bed and good linens but are on the smallish side. The room and bathrooms are very clean.  

Breakfast 

Breakfast was fullsome with lots of options including an egg menu. Try and book a bed and breakfast rate because otherwise breakfast is €22 euros! 

Service

This is where the hotel differentiates itself. To be honest, the hotel is probably more of a 4* star but the service is really 5*! From check in to check out, everyone was friendly and incredibly accommodating. 

A big shout out to Grant who truly went above and beyond to make sure that our room issues didn't impact our trip. From personalized messages to macaroons in our room to dinner and drinks etc. He was incredibly apologetic and tried to make us feel special. Much appreciated! 

Dane at concierge was also amazing...nothing was too much trouble and he was so pleasant to deal with!! 

Look, everyone from the bellmen, concierge, front desk, breakfast staff (esp the hostess), bar staff, and management, are making sure that you have the best experience. All amazing. 

Great hotel, would definitely stay again !!",5,2016,04,05
204,Top notch service & beautiful hotel ,"Really enjoyed this hotel! The service was amazing. My wife and I have stayed all over the world and this was about the best service we have experienced. If we needed anything for our room; another towel, more shampoo it came quickly. We had a bad experience with a taxi that we got from the hotel. Rude driver, who charged us for waiting when he was early, etc. We mentioned the bad service to our hotel and they were so nice about complimenting the taxi and offering a drink at the bar. The Fitzwilliam Hotel prides itself on good service & made sure we experienced this on our stay. The room was spacious, nicely decorated, big tub, comfortable bed, & nice seating area to read or relax. If we come back to Dublin we would definitely stay here again! ",5,2016,04,03
204,Wonderful Stay And Great Location,"The Fitzwilliam is in the center of Dublin and is within walking distance of several attractions in Dublin like St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin Castle, Trinity College and St. Stephen's Green. We arrived at the hotel around 10 AM and our room was ready which was fantastic.The front desk was very friendly and informative. Note** They will charge your credit card 150 Euro's for incidentals at time of check in and charge will be removed at checkout if there are no additional charges. Our room had very nice decor and was in good condition. The bed was comfortable and there was ample closet space. The concierge desk was fantastic with giving us directions to points of interest. I would highly recommend this hotel for people visiting Dublin.",4,2016,04,02
204,Excellent Hotel,"Brilliant thank you, my friend Ann & l had a super stay excellent room service. Could not fault anything look forward to seeing you soon. A special  “Thank you ” to  Anne for the commentry on the City Tour Bus tour. Visited lots of places, Guiness Brewery, Jameson Whiskey  & The history of Irish Whsy thoughly enjoyable ..........",5,2016,04,02
204,It's expensive but still nice to pop in for a calm midday drink,We popped in here to get away from the madness of the 1916 celebrations on Easter Monday and it was surprisingly quiet. Yes drinks are expensive but it's lovely and relaxing here. Toilets are quite a distance from bar.,4,2016,03,30
204,Excellent Service!,"We chose this hotel because we were only going to be in Dublin for two nights and we wanted a convenient location.  What we didn't realize was that it was going to be very difficult for us to get out of the city on Easter Sunday morning to make our flight to Edinburgh, due to road closures for the observation of the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising.  When we checked in, the staff alerted us to the issue.  Patrick, the hotel's excellent concierge, took charge of the situation and worked with our transportation while we explored Dublin.  Our thanks to Patrick and the entire Fitzwilliam team for taking such good care of us.",5,2016,03,30
204,Quality food,"Excellent food, elegant bar and restaurant, awesome location.
I visited this hotel while attending a company party.
Particularly loved the bar,  the staff was professional and helpful as well.
The 3 course dinner was absolutely lovely, excellent food.
Hotel was very clean as well, definitely a lovely place to visit/ stay/ eat.",5,2016,03,29
204,Excellent Hotel and Service,"The hotel is located in the center of Dublin, from there you can walk anywhere and lets not forget that you have an amazing park right in front of it. The rooms are very comfortable and the lounge is perfect to meet up with your family and have a talk. The concierge service is excellent and they are multilingual (which is really helpful if you are Spanish and don't know how to speak English). Also, if you have any doubt about anything like what excursions to take or where to eat ask they will kindly help you.",5,2016,03,29
204,"excellent location , and service","We decided to stay at the hotel due to its location. the team at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. 
a good size of the bathroom and bedroom, lots of light. Bathrooms are also very nice and spacious. ",4,2016,03,28

204,Excellent,"Stayed at this hotel for a business trip which happened to also coincide with Valentines. The atmosphere in the hotel was fabulous. Underground car park which is great. The reception staff were very friendly and couldn't be more helpful. The decor in this hotel is quirky and the rooms are spacious and comfortable, also extremely clean. Didn't eat here but the bar area was nice. Location is excellent, within walking distance of city centre and all attractions. Would return!  ",5,2016,03,26
204,Absolutely wonderful experience,"Our family of four was warmly greeted despite showing up at 10 am after flying in from the US.  The room was still occupied by the previous guest. The front desk clerks and concierge were great. They told us they would prepare our room as soon as it is as available, offered to store our luggage and suggested nearby sights that we might enjoy. The service was stellar throughout our two day stay. The recommendations for food and music were all great. The breakfasts were delicious with lots to choose from. Very personalized service. Importantly, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the location was perfect, walkable to many of the things we wanted to see. ",5,2016,03,25
204,"Great staff, good beds, rooms clean but dysfunctional","While the staff was terrific and the rooms interestingly decorated, there was no cold water on  the taps in either room(ouch) and in our new rooms the fridge didn't open and in both rooms air conditioning was necessary as the rooms were stifling even when we turned the heat off. For a hotel this pricey the facilities should be top notch.",3,2016,03,25
204,Great staff but not a 5# hotel ,"I have taken a while to decide to write this review but as the hotel is charging 5# prices but you aren't getting a 5# hotel, it seemed only fair to let other people know , especially if choosing for this year. This was our first trip to Dublin for a long time. We had chosen this hotel due to its reviews & pictures of the rooms but depending on what you are used to this is NOT a 5# hotel. 
We have stayed in many 5# establishments around the world & we are sad to have to say this is not one of them. 

You are welcomed by the hotels concierge who were excellent at their job. Their greeting is very warm & welcoming. 
The reception team are exactly the same, professional ,polite & professional.  
In fact all the staff are brilliant at their jobs. They need to be to make up for the shortfalls of the hotel itself. 

It is the quality of the rooms that let this hotel down. It is obvious that no reinvestment has been made into the hotel in a long time. It has been a make do & mend policy. Which is clear for all to see who use the hotel. Carpets are tired & grubby in the bedroom. The first room we were issued with the carpet was actually thread bare at the joins. - not 5# 
The next room was bearable - carpet could have done with a steam clean, the furniture was dated and patched up - in some cases not even patched up - so not 5# 
We were so disappointed at the quality of the level of maintenance that had been evident in 2 rooms, not just one, that we took photos to show you. 
The MD & his policies have a lot to answer for. You can not continue to trade on an old rating and not upgrade the rooms. 
We did accept the room, due to reason for our visit. If it had just been up to us- we would have checked out that same day but as family members recommended it , it would have been awkward to move hotels. 
The price for a four night stay was over €1200 
For bed & breakfast - 5# prices. 

One small point - the hotel offers a ""Turn Down"" service. What they actually do is place chocolates & the hotels Room Service & ""Do Not Disturb"" on your bed. They do not ""Turn Down"" your bed, fold back your sheets to ease your entry into your bed - so, why do it ? 
It seems a waste of time, effort & money , when it should be spent on the furniture in each room, that needs proper repair, or replacement. 

As I said at the beginning - lovely , lovely staff - it's the quality of the furniture and the regular upkeep, (not the housekeeping as they can only work with what they have)of the rooms that let this hotel down. 
They are charging 5# prices for average rooms.

204,Great Dublin hotel,"I spent 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel on St Stephen's Square, Dublin (March 2016). It's am excellent location with great views over the park.  I had a garden room with a lovely view and my own personal orchid!  The facilities in the room were excellent and high spec. The hotel has a cosy reception area with open fire.  ",5,2016,03,23
204,Great location and superb staff,"Stayed in this hotel for the rugby at weekend with 3 other friends. Location was ideal and the staff were very accommodating. 
The overnight parking for 10 euro with valet service was an added bonus.
Rooms not the largest I have stayed in but all in all highly recommendable albeit expensive hotel. ",4,2016,03,22
204,Great stay,"Arriving after midnight on St Patrick's Day, our stay at the Fitzwilliam was excellent from start to finish! The staff were all very pleasant and engaging. Rooms were to a very high standard with nice amenities. Room service prompt. Very accommodating of our early check-out very helpful with a follow-up call to make sure we were awake, a pre-arranged airport taxi and final bill ready to go. Can't beat the location. Hope to be back soon!",5,2016,03,21
204,Great hotel in superb location,"6 of us shared 3 twin room at the Fitzwilliam during our trip to Dublin for the rugby international. It is a spacious, modern, upscale hotel built around a central contemporary courtyard. It is brilliantly situated opposite St.Stephen's Green and within strolling distance of Dublin 2's best pubs and restaurants. The lobby and bar areas are spacious and nicely laid out and the rooms are comfortable and nicely appointed.  From start to finish the staff could not have been more professional- they all had a lovely service-driven attitude and are an asset to the business. The hotel has a hugely helpful concierge service which is also a great asset.   Out room rate was expensive but the hotel is very good, brilliantly situated and not overpriced. I'll definitely return when next in Dublin.  ",5,2016,03,20
204,Weekend Rugby visit,"What a great hotel in a fantastic position.
Staff are really attentive and there are a number of them, from the door thru reception to the bar and every one took the time to greet you.
Rooms are good, very clean and well presented, the fire in the lobby is perfect of a cold night and what did catch my eye were the flowers - fresh and colourful in all areasand our room.
Would highly recommend.",5,2016,03,20
204,Stunning hotel and staff,"Stunning hotel with a quality of service I haven’t had for a long time.  Every staff member, from check-in – to breakfast – to check out was exceptional and uber-professional.  Breakfast wasn’t the typical buffet set-up but a-la-carte and all food cooked fresh.  Very nice.

Location is second to none and directly opposite the Luas (tram) stop – handy if travelling out of the city towards and beyond Leopardstown.  I stayed in the first week of January and was exceptional value.

The rooms are absolutely beautiful.  I would happily stay here for leisure reasons as well as for business.  One downside was that the rooms seemed very thin and I could hear a lot of noise from adjacent rooms with immense clarity, fortunately this was just phone conversations and some coughing and sneezing before I headed out rather than anything that may be found at bedtime!  My colleagues also staying during this visit also commented on the noise from adjacent rooms.",5,2016,03,15
204,Pampered at a Friends Home,"This is where you want to stay if you want to be pamper and be surrounded with people who are more your friend than a hotel employee.  Everyone from the doormen to the bartenders are beyond professional, kind and fun.  This is not a snobby hotel and that's what makes it so great.  No attitude just great service and it shows.  The rooms are amazing with a rotary phone, bar claw tub, and four poster bed. - you can't go wrong with the Fitzwilliams. ",5,2016,03,14
204,Absolutely 5* Experience,"The best hotel I have ever stayed at! At first sight it looked a bit stiff but the ladies at the reception desk - so nice and welcoming, immediately changed the atmosphere. And I must notice that it is not for the facility itself which is perfect and luxurious but comparable to other, 5 star hotels, but it is the people who work there that make such a difference! And they constitute such a mixture of nations from true Irish to North Americans, but they are all very professional, very nice and attentive at the same time. Thank you to Patrick - the concierge so knowledgable and helpful and who treated us to marvelous Guinness that we would never be able to try, to Natalia who was especially great assistance at breakfast, and the beautiful girl from Argentina at the reception desk (I'm so sorry don't remember the name). Nothing for the staff there is a problem, each request is like a wish. You drop your shopping at the reception and when you come back it's already waiting for you in your room! You ask to print the ticket and e-mail it to the reception - a moment later it's slipped, nicely wrapped in an envelope, under your door as not to disturb you. You just want to spend your money on such a service! But to be fair I must acknowledge the hotel itself - splendid and luxurious with absolutely wonderful breakfasts (both served and buffet) hot and cold, full Irish if you want, less attractive for a veggie like me but there was such a variety of fruits and gorgeous coffee that it all made up for it. And the location - in the centre of Dublin, next to the famous Grafton Street but opposite the park at the same time. Loved it all, will come back, and recommend to everybody.",5,2016,03,13
204,Excellent,"MY first time at this hotel and I will definitely go back again.Great location for Grafton street and the hotel interiour is lovely.How ever what made it such a great short stay were the staff.Helpful,friendly and even cleaning staff in the corridors gave a genuine smile,one lady even helped me with my shopping bags without asking her.Great food and worth the money for the stay.Lovely bathroom and huge bath.I have stayed at other hotels in Dublin but this is the best so far.Plus the Luas is just outside the door!",5,2016,03,12
204,Great location,"This is lovely hotel in a great location just off the main attractions but close enough to walk to everything.

204,Awesome service,"Awesome service. I would give a 5-star review if the beds would have been more comfortable. The bed was too small (too short even) for me and my girlfriend. Also, the comforter didn't seem to be the same size as the cover, so only haft of the covers actually had some comforter inside it. Weird. ",4,2016,03,07

Beautiful modern hotel with striking colours that proclaim you're in a haven of modern luxury. Room was comfortable and had all the good amenities I required. Bathroom was clean and ""well-stocked""

Excellent and friendly staff and promptly respond to all queries and make you feel special and very welcome. The guys at the front door are particularly respectful to a point of courtesy one barely sees these days. Breakfast at the Citron was lovely and attentive. Unfortunately I did not  get to sample Thornton's Michelen star restaurant - but I know I will one day revisit !! ",5,2016,03,07

The hotel itself is decorated in a contemporary style.  The rooms are well equipped and well decorated with some offering a view of a roof top garden.  Staff in the hotel are very friendly and helpful.  Umbrellas are available from the concierge should it happen to be raining on your visit.

I would most definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2016,02,22
204,Stylish hotel in great location,"Spent just the one night here visiting a friend in Dublin and on the whole enjoyed our stay. Modern boutique hotel in the perfect location just a few seconds walk from the top of Grafton Street and the beautiful St Stephens Green.
Comfortable bed in a well furnished sizeable room with view onto the Green; large bathroom with both separate bath and shower. Perhaps our only complaint about the room was that it was too hot during the night and the balance between getting the aircon right and having the window open (with the passing late night/early morning revellers) was difficult.
Staff were helpful and friendly although at check-in it was not explained that we had breakfast in a room rate (so ate outside) and only found out at check-out.
We enjoyed a post-dinner drink in the buzzy bar and enjoyed relaxing in front of the fire in the lobby area, although it was a bit cool when sitting away from the fire.
Overall a good hotel and we'd consider staying there again (though didn't think it was as good as their sister hotel in Belfast).",4,2016,02,21
204,"Fantastic hotel, great location","My friend and I visited this hotel a couple of weeks ago and it was amazing. The staff could not do enough for us. Very attentive and friendly. Our room was spotless with beautiful decor. There was even a real orchid on the table between the window seats and a single real flower in the bathroom. The breakfast was amazing and plenty of choice. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin, it's just perfect. Overlooking St Stephens Green, it is in a good location to walk to all the attractions but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar late nighters.",5,2016,02,21
204,Cosy luxury,Thanks to a Christmas present from the family we were treated to an overnight stay . We checked in early & we upgraded . Everything in the room was fine although the bed was surprising small for a deluxe room. The walls are a bit thin as we could hear our neighbours & a conversation in the hallway late at night. We had a good breakfast & checked out around 11 but we could have waited until 12. We ate in BANG restaurant ( also part of our treat ) which was excellent if a bit pricey €190 for two but we did indulge .,4,2016,02,21
204,Comfortable quality top of the range hotel,"A hotel of high quality, which ticks all the boxes of a 5 star hotel. Staff were professional, a few really lovely. My room was of high standard and faced St Stephens green. Which was lovely. Other rooms faced a nice internal courtyard garden. I just felt that the customer's take on things came second eg no overhead light in room, so was a bit dark, and a fixed shower head, whuch vetoed the shower. But these are just my personal preferences not fulfilled. Also, I was there on business and had tried to book my room for a second night. But they preferred to leave it empty than offer me the same business rate. The visitor rate they quoted was well beyond my means. (€206)",4,2016,02,19
204,Returning customer,"Each time I need an overnight stay during the work week, I phone the hotel and I am always well looked after. I don't have to go through address/ personal details each time. It's an efficient and easy process. Concierge team has superb memories and remember your last trip, quality of service is excellent and it's because of this I continue to return. Very easy access, car parking facilities all make it an attractive city centre choice. ",5,2016,02,18
204,"Beautiful, friendly & 5-Star!","We had a wonderful trip to Dublin this last week and the Fitzwilliam was completely perfect! The service was impeccable with every detail thought out. This hotel goes down as one of my favorites with service, bed comfort, the staff went way above and beyond anytime you asked a question or needed something, and the location was perfect-- St. Stephens Green was close to everything and so lovely. Can't recommend enough!",5,2016,02,16
204,A good boutique hotel,"This hotel is centrally located, is quiet for business meetings and is well run. Breakfast is very good. The bar, located at the back of the hotel is ideal for a quiet business meeting or lunch or both. ",4,2016,02,16
204,Underwhelmed,Small and noisy rooms. It is in a good location and we had 3 rooms so had to choose a reasonably priced hotel. Bar was without atmosphere and the whole place seemed to lack charm. I would not put it on my recommended list.,3,2016,02,15
204,Nice stay in downtown Dublin,The Fitzwilliam is directly on St Stephens Green.  The rooms overlooking the green have great views.  The other rooms have a pleasant view of the garden.  The rooms were very nicely decorated and the staff friendly and helpful.  The open fire in the lobby is a pleasure to sit by after a long day's walking.  ,5,2016,02,14
204,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic location","Went to Dublin for some pre christmas shopping, couldn't believe how convenient the location was. Right in the heart of the city, right beside amazing shops and fab restaurants . Rooms very comfortable, food great. Definitely recommend if you're heading to Dublin.",5,2016,02,14
204,Mature Couple Valentines weekend,Excellent hotel with clean tidy bedrooms and good bathroom facilities and most of all a comfy bed!! The staff were a credit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. A nice touch was the two delicious chocolates left on the bed each night to go with the tea and coffee making facilities available in the bedroom after a long exciting day and night out in Dublin!,5,2016,02,14
204,Service is the key...,"... to a hotel's reputation, and the service at this hotel for our short stay this weekend was second to none. The reservation desk staff dealt with a minor confusion particularly well and we enjoyed our visit no end. The location, quality of accommodation and above all the staff, played their part. We will be back.",4,2016,02,14
204,Six nations weekend,"Great two night stay. Lovely rooms, perfect central location, staff could not be more helpful. 
The meal in citron bistro as part of the package was slightly disappointing. Only a minor point. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay again ",4,2016,02,09
204,Great breakaway,"Fantastic hotel, great location, high standard of decoration.  The staff were excellent, especially the concierge team and the staff in the breakfast restaurant.  The room was well equipped, clean and comfortable.  The breakfast was excellent, the choice was exceptional and staff couldn't do enough to ensure you had everything you wanted even if it wasn't available on the buffet.  The staff make you feel welcome and special, thanks to Will Woods for his help both before and during our stay.  I would recommend this hotel to everyone I know and would come back again.",5,2016,02,09
204,1st trip to Dublin,"From the start of our trip when we were checked in very early to the end of our trip when checkout was the most relaxed of any other city hotel we have stayed in we were made to feel very welcome.  The staff are amazing, nothing was too much trouble from sorting out travel to the Gold Cup to providing tips on the racing form - still didn't win! Staying at the Fitzwilliam made our first trip to Dublin something special and we would certainly recommend it to anyone planning a trip.  Thanks to all the staff for helping make it a fun and romantic break.",5,2016,02,09
204,Friendliest hotel I ever stayed at,"I just spent 2 nights at this hotel. Loved it. Amazingly friendly and professional staff. Great rooms, good food, great location. Also the breakfast was super! This is the only hotel I will stay in if I ever go back to Dublin.",5,2016,02,09
204,Great stay,"Superb hotel, great service and location. Quality of decoration, very central yet quiet.
Breakfast was excellent and staff extremely helpful and cordial.
I would come back and strongly recommend this hotel",5,2016,02,07
204,Perfect location for business and leisure,"Very well equipped rooms and bathrooms. They are all quiet. Very nice bar and the staff here are all exceptionally helpful and courteous. The breakfast room is a little on the small size for such a large hotel, and although this was not a problem at the times I had breakfast, it could become a problem at certain times.
Location is perfect. The Luas is outside the door and most destinations are an easy walk away.",5,2016,02,03
204,romantice weekend,"What a wonderful hotel in a great location. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel special. The staff are wonderful and the ambience relax. The rooms are not huge but very very comfortable and if you get one overlooking the Green it is even better. You are spoilt for choice when it comes to dining, either stay in or visit the hundreds of local paces",4,2016,02,02
204,Great stay!,"When I come to Dublin, the Fitzwilliam is at the top of my list.  Friendly and cordial staff greet you after a busy day of work or sightseeing. The rooms are decorated nicely and I have yet to hear any noise from outside. As it is next to a St. Stephen's Green and close to shopping and buskers, noise could be an issue, but not at the Fitzwilliam.  ",4,2016,02,01
204,Practically a 5-star,"Great, clean, modern room.  Comfortable bed.  Great Hotel Bar.  Great Location.  Housekeeping was good but it was hard to communicate small important details due to language barrier.  Nonetheless the rooms were very clean and my laundry was done in 8-hours, not the 24-hours as I expected.",4,2016,01,31
204,The best five star in Dublin.,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam for my mums birthday and had a beautiful experience from the moment we stepped inside. Everything was just perfect. Staff were very professional, friendly and helpful. Our room looked over St Stephens Green, was luxurious, stylish and comfortable. Had a lovely dinner in the Citron Restaurant where once again the staff, menu and food were excellent. Location is ideal for shopping and sightseeing. The extra touches and excellence of this hotel made our weekend very special. I have just booked my next visit and cannot wait to return to the Fitzwilliam. Would definitely recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,01,25
204,Great location for short break in Dublin,"Perfect location for a weekend in Dublin - short walk to many of the local sights, bars and restaurants etc.

Our room was quiet and comfortable - staff were very helpful and friendly. 

Couple of remarks/tips - Sunday breakfast was really busy - we were lucky to get in as a table of two - other larger groups had to wait 15 minutes or more to get seated and then hot food was slow to arrive - can't blame the staff here, as they were working really hard to deal with a packed restaurant - hotel really needs a larger room to cope with demand. 

Linked to this - there was no hot water at 09:00 on Sunday morning! Demand exceeded supply - no easy answer to this, but either get in the shower early or stay in bed!",4,2016,01,25
204,Lovely visit,We had a lovely visit to this hotel on new years day to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Great surprise to be upgraded - hotel has everything you need for a luxury stay in Dublin and we will most definately return soon,4,2016,01,24
204,Fabulous Stay,"We stayed in a deluxe room with a balcony overlooking St Stephens Green.  Everything about the room, the hotel and the staff were fantastic.  It was a 1\couple of weeks before Christmas and the atmosphere and happiness of the staff just radiated through the hotel.
I can't wait to stay here again when I am next in Dublin.",5,2016,01,20
204,Poor Nights Sleep,"Stayed here before Christmas, location couldnt be better. Really nice clean room but walls seem to be paper thin. We could hear the people chatting in the room next door and night time was crazy hearing so much noise from people passing on the corridor. The door staff were so friendly and polite  offering to carry my shopping bags each time i came back in. ",3,2016,01,20
204,60th Birthday Celebration,"Chose the hotel as our base for a weekend to celebrate my 60th. Room was situated about 100 metres from the lift, well appointed although corporate and characterless.  Breakfast very good and bar prices reasonable. Had asked in advance to be considered for an upgrade given the occasion....received a note from the manager acknowledging my birthday and saying they would do everything to make our stay memorable. No room upgrade but it was accompanied by a packet of four very small macaroons....which, of course, was indeed the highlight of our stay.",4,2016,01,18
204,"Outstanding service, great hotel","We spent three days on New Year's Eve onwards at the hotel and the only thing I can say it is that it was a superb experience. From the concierge that sent us a list of restaurants for the dinner on December 31st, to the reception (Polina checked us in and out and I want to praise her for her friendliness, smile and readiness to help).
Following some of the advice here, we requested a room at the back of the hotel. We got room 529, with a queen size bed. The room was of decent size with vibrant colors but yet inspiring a sense of calm.
We had complimentary mineral water, coffee and tea and the newspaper in the morning.
The room has a decent desk (even though the lighting might be a bit soft to work if you are there on business), the Wi-Fi worked very well and there was an iron and ironing board (another must if you are on a business trip).
The bathroom needs a special mention as the shower is the best shower I've ever experienced in my life... I wish I had such a great water pressure at home. it is just perfect (slippers and bath robes were also available). The toiletries were really good.
The bathroom light was very good and there was a vanity mirror that helped when dealing with make up.
Breakfast was another superb experience just because the service was so good. The gentleman at the reception of the breakfast room (whose name unfortunately I did not catch but I would like to praise for service and professionalism when it seemed almost everybody intended to have breakfast at the same time on the 1st of January). The offering is good, not too much but excellent quality (I recommend the smoothies, the omelets and the pancakes).
The hotel is well located near the shops and most of attractions, which allows to walk almost everywhere.
If I were to return to Dublin, I will not even consider any other place to stay!",5,2016,01,18
204,Wonderfull place to stay,"After a recent 5 night stay at the Fitzwilliam - I understand why it gets such great reviews. It deserves it. You can't beat the location - right in the heart of Dublin City. My room was spectacular overlooking St. Stephens Green with a very comfortable bed - which is very important to me. The food in Le Citron , Inn on the Park  and room service breakfast was great. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff  - they really seem to enjoy their jobs and taking care of guests.
",5,2016,01,15
204,Nice hotel,"Very nice hotel
Comfortable bed and furnishings 
Bathroom products very good and lovely deep bath
Breakfast staff very attentive and good overall very good - would probably stay again
Great location next to st Stephens green and Grafton street ...",5,2016,01,14
204,Beautiful hotel,"Great location in the centre of Dublin.  fantastic staff, always so helpful and professional. . Rooms are beautiful., really a little bit special. Beds are ultra comfortable. Food is great. Love this hotel.",5,2016,01,13
204,A fabulous Christmas experience.,"I stayed again at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin during the Christmas period 2015 as a result of the superb time i had experienced there the previous Christmas.  The hotel in itself is lovely and the food is top class - but the attention to detail and the friendliness and commitment of all staff shines above all else. They are a superb team of people - totally professional, kind and caring and they treat each customer as though he/she is their one and only concern.  
I was extremely impressed with the service afforded to me and am delighted to highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel as THE place to stay in Dublin!  
Kay Looney",5,2016,01,10
204,Christmas drinks,"My friends and I came for late Christmas drinks to Fitzwilliam Hotel. We were kindly greeted by professional gentleman, bar Manager Tomas, who made us feel very welcome. He made us amazing cocktails and we absolutely fell in love with pornstar martini, the best cocktail in the world...amazing experience!",5,2016,01,09
204,"Lovely Hotel, great location and best of all..great staff","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam over the Christmas period.  Probably not the best time to experience Dublin at its best as most things were closed, however our trip was made special by the friendly, efficient and personable staff at the hotel.  The hotel itself had good facilities, lovely rooms and is in a great location for everything.  As most of the bars were closed Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing day we made the most of the hotels facilities, in particular the bar!  Tomas (I think he was the bar manager) was there most nights and looked after us serving us delicious cocktails. He is a great guy and made us feel very welcome and looked after us impeccably.  What an asset to the hotel!  Craig who worked with him was great too.  Overall a nice relaxing trip and I would certainly have no hesitation in returning.",5,2016,01,09
204,Best cocktails in the city!,"I have always loved The Fitzwilliam on every level - Amazing rooms with the best views, fantastic restaurants with cool staff, but for me The Inn on The Green bar is where it's at. If you're looking for superb cocktails ask for Tomas - he knows more than a thing or two about creating top notch cocktails. The fact he is possibly the best looking barman in the city only adds to it ;-) #mixology",5,2016,01,09
204,Worst Christmas ever,This is not a 5 star hotel. It felt more like a 3/4 star hotel. We had a unhappy stay here over Christmas. It was unclean and tired. The service was very poor. I would never return. Very disappointed.,2,2016,01,07
204,Dublin is a bubblin',Dublin was Irish to the highest standards of Irish. The leprechauns were out in force. Guinness flowed from the armpits of river dancers lining every sidewalk. To be sure to be sure. I loved Ireland. Shamrock.,5,2016,01,06
204,High-end accommodations and service,"This hotel was stunning and the service was impeccable. Our room wasn't quite ready at check-in and the front desk offered a complimentary meal and beverage while we waited. Fluffy robes, chocolates on the pillows and turndown service were extra nice touches.  Many  Dublin sites are within easy walking distance including Grafton St., Temple Bar, and a little bit longer walk to the Guinness factory",5,2016,01,05
204,"Very lovely hotel: clean, well located, nice rooms (and large for Europe).  Great stay.","Truly enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin.  It is very well situated, outstanding room and bathroom, nice bar and restaurant, quiet room, and pleasant lobby.  The only issue would be with the staffing, which most of the time seemed confused and very new.  That said, they were all very nice and pleasant, so it made up for the lack of knowledge or memory.",4,2016,01,04
204,"Christmas night stay in the Fitswilliam hotel on the Green, Dublin","It was a pleasant stay for one night over the Christmas break away from the kids and dog, the staff were fine but nor overly friendly but attentive and courteous.  We did not use the amenities so cant comment on this part of the hotel. There just wasn't much of a buzz to the place..........",4,2016,01,04
204,Superb service - definitely a cut above the rest!,"What made my stay special was the helpfulness, courtesy and professionalism of all of the staff that I encountered : a lovely team of people who are extremely good at meeting  the needs of their guests. 

Breakfast dining was top class, and a real pleasure. My food was freshly cooked - and to perfection. Likewise with dinner in my room. I also took some friends for a quick lunch in the hotel bar - again the food was very good, as was its presentation.

My room was OK, but not five star. Lighting was very poor - and it was almost impossible to read comfortably.  Bedside lights particularly inadequate in this respect. The room overlooked a courtyard - and unfortunately was directly overlooked by some offices opposite. No easy chairs, and room safe almost at floor level - in an unlit wardrobe. Overall decor was tired. Sound insulation from rooms above could be better. Hotel room doors slam, which is very unpleasant - particularly at night - and could easily be remedied with simple design modifications. On the plus side, my bed was very comfortable, and my bathroom was well equipped ( and well - lit ) with an excellent, deep bath. Nice room touches included a CD player and FM radio, as well as a complimentary umbrella. The room WiFi was excellent - and unlike some other Dublin hotels, it was free.

Lots of delightful sweetmeats left in my room every evening - and a lovely handwritten Christmas card from the hotel manager, signed by various members of staff. A very thoughtful gesture indeed - and much appreciated.

I stayed here for five nights over the Christmas period, having been rebooked at the Fitzwilliam by British Airways when my usual hotel - the Dublin Conrad - failed to deliver on the terms of my original booking with them.

Despite my criticisms about my room, I will certainly stay at the Futzwilliam in future when I visit Dublin - if only for the exemplary guest service provided by the staff, the food, and the excellent location of the hotel!",4,2016,01,03
204,Wonderful stay,"We made an excellent choice in the Fitzwilliam. The location and 5-star rating were our prime considerations and we weren't disappointed. The staff went out of their way to accommodate us, our son and daughter-in-law and their two little boys and were unfazed by little mishaps. The room was quiet and clean though on the small side, perhaps because of the addition of a single bed. I missed an armchair but it was probably the one outside the room. Breakfast was divine, plentiful and one of the best selections we've had in comparable hotels. Smiling Alexandra and her equally ever smiling staff bent over backwards to supply the boys with tailor made combinations of their own breakfast choices.
Loved the complimentary umbrellas😀
We'll recommend this hotel and hope to return.",5,2016,01,02
204,"If you can, you MUST stay here!","What is so special about it? Its fantastic location, a few minutes' walk from shops, theaters, tourist attractions incl trinity college, temple bar, yet beautifully quiet right in front of the Green. It's staff are incredibly polite, efficient and nothing is ever a problem for them, from wet beds and broken plates, courtesy of our young kids, and hiring cars (a 6-seater) at short notice. The breakfast is amazing: the continental spread is so varied, with fresh smoothies, veggie juices, pastries, donuts, so many varieties of fresh and dried fruit, cereals, etc etc and then, they take your order for a breakfast that is cooked especially for you - no tasteless, watery rubber passing itself off as scrambled eggs or reheated sausages in schafing dishes here!! It's topped off by Alexandra who is the most attentive b'fast hostess ever - a real managerial gem, whose team are so helpful and charming, even giving us boxes to pack b'fast pastries into for elevenses on our outing in the car! So thoughtful!! The rooms are modern, comfy, spacious and quiet and the toiletries are yummy too. I must also mention Victor, the concierge who was instrumental in helping us make our family stay one full of child-friendly attractions, delectable dinners and provided other practical advice. You won't regret it - stay here!!! Only problem is your kids might never want to leave!! :) ",5,2015,12,31
204,Fantastic customer service in a great location,"My family of 5 (2 adults 3 children ) and my siblings and parents recently stayed for a week. We were all very impressed. The location is perfect, the rooms are modern and clean. Delicious breakfast included in the rate. Best Christmas dinner we have ever eaten, small touches in the room made a difference, the hall way to hang coats and store shoes and luggage was great. what really stands out was the customer service, every one was so pleasant and helpful which really added to the whole experience. Also one of the quietest hotels I have ever stayed in. Hope to be back again soon. ",5,2015,12,30
204,Quality!,"Really nice hotel by the green. Great service, good food and relaxing. Only stayed for 3 nights but has still left a good impression. Comfortable beds, clean bathrooms and good service. Easy access to the town for shopping etc. Would recommend.",4,2015,12,28
204,A plush business hotel in an ideal location,"The location of this hotel, at the top of Grafton Street, opposite the beautiful St. Stephen's Green with the Luas tram stop on its door step, simply could not be better.
I had a standard double room, it was modern, clean, comfortable and well equipped but not luxurious.
I would categorise the Fitzwilliam as a plush business hotel.
On the down side, I had a courtyard view, which meant when I opened my curtains I had a clear view into the room across the courtyard, and likewise they had a clear view into mine.
I might go back on business, but not for pleasure - the hotel lacks character and atmosphere  - but it does somewhat make up for these with its location.
Faultless customer service.
Good value by comparison with other similarly graded hotels nearby.",4,2015,12,28
204,One of only two Hotels in Dublin I consider truly Five Star.,"Another amazing stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel , this time with the family.  I have to complement the Fitzwilliam  on the way the kids were treated from the time of arrival to departure, nothing  was too much trouble. During the night one of the girls  was very sick and had a mishap and within minutes staff were up to our room and helped in every way, thank you to the night porters and housekeeping team.  Dined in the Hotels own restaurant which was superb , had my usual Eggs Benedict for breakfast, again a triumph . We also dined in Thornton’s, the latter lost its Michelin star recently, for me the experience was even better than last time, the braised pigs head, celeriac purée and poitin sauce, it appeared to be , squid ink & poitin with the celeriac puree on top , looked like a baby Guinness, but was so divine.  Also I noted the Kevin Thornton himself serving tables.  For the life of my I cannot understand these Michelin inspectors, they must surely have off days as well. They certainly got this one wrong.   Again the Fitzwilliam , along with the Merrion are the best two Five Star Hotels in Dublin",5,2015,12,28
204,Thoroughly spoilt at Christmas!,"We're just back from a wonderful Christmas stay at the Fitzwilliam where we were thoroughly spoilt from the day we arrived. Everyday, chocolates and petit fours (including mini mince pies!) were placed in our room and our Christmas Day lunch at the Citron restaurant was the best Christmas lunch ever! 

This hotel does not live up to a 5 star standard though - a 4 star would be more appropriate. Rooms are wonderfully spacious but decor throughout the hotel could do with refreshing a little and the Inn On The Green looks and feels dated. Websites offering this hotel do a good job of making it seem grander than it is in reality. 

Reception and restaurant staff were lovely, kind and caring - ensuring to make for a perfect stay at Christmas time. Door and bar staff seemed unhappy and tired but we absolutely appreciate they were working over Christmas, which may have not been what they had wanted to do.

Excellent location.",4,2015,12,28
204,Amazing Location,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam. Our room overlooked St. Stephens Green, which was nice. I liked to leave the windows open to hear the musicians playing outside. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were a little flat.

We had trouble with our shower draining. We asked for 3 days for someone to come fix it. Each time the person we spoke to (a different person each time) was very friendly and said it would get fixed right away. But we would return from a day of sightseeing and it wasn't. On the third day we finally spoke to a manager, who made sure that it was fixed.

Everyone who works at the hotel is very friendly. On our last day we were supposed to have a taxi at a certain time. When we had been waiting for 5 minutes with no taxi, Tony went down the street to a taxi stand so we would not have to drag our luggage to get us one. It was very kind of him to do that.

The hotel was located within walking distance of almost all the major sights. We walked almost everywhere.",4,2015,12,27
204,"Quality city centre ideal, ideal for short break in Dublin","Very friendly and helpful staff, lovely quiet room, excellent breakfast, location right beside Grafton Street and on St Stephens Green, convenient basement car park: the perfect place for a stay in Dublin!",5,2015,12,22
204,Weekend Away ,"Hotel was beautiful and staff could not have been nicer and an excellent location especially for shopping trips away.However for a five star hotel the rooms were not up to standard and the wifi was very poor, good wifi is an essential for all modern hotels. Other than this could not fault had a fabulous weekend ",4,2015,12,20
204,A little didappointed,"Had read a few reviews that said this hotel was not really 5 star but I took this with a pinch of salt & booked anyway. However now I've stayed I tend to agree. 
The staff were very friendly & that's a def plus. Everyone made you feel welcomed and at ease. 
The reception area was very cold and check in was busy so you def felt cold by the time you were checked in. 
Not sure what the difference was between my deluxe room and a standard room. The room was very small as was the bathroom- def not enough for two in the bathroom. I had expected a free standing bath but didn't have one. 
Thought we'd have a drink from the mini bar but no glasses to drink from. Basic tea n coffee provided- UHT milk, no biscuits or shortbread. 
Ate in the citron. One of 3 tables at 7.30 on a Saturday night. No atmosphere. Had emailed during week to change booking to thorntons but never received a reply. Also emailed enquiring about canapés in bar- again no reply. 
Breakfast service was haphazard, buffet not kept well topped up. Hot food lacked presentation or imagination. Nothing above the ordinary. 
In summary this hotel is more 4 star standard. Perfectly adequate but not 5 star and not worth €400 a night ",3,2015,12,16
204,Mr C,"Stayed here 1 night great location for shopping & Stephens Green. But the walk to our room was further than Grafton St from the lift. Staff are very polite and helpful.
Good bar.
breakfast could be better bacon not great but a great selection of everything.
I noticed the complementary Bottled water is discontinued what a shame.",3,2015,12,15
204,One of my ll time favorites,This hotel had far and away the best food we had on our entire trip!  The breakfasts were spectacular. So many healthy choices. Our room was gorgeous and we were right on the park. There were musicians and entertainers along the shopping way. It was so festive.,5,2015,12,15
204,Glitz at the Fitz,"Ideal location in the heart of Dublin on St Stephens Green. Easy walking distance from shops, restaurants and traditional Irish pubs. You can expect a friendly welcome from staff who will be keen to ensure your stay is ideal. Rooms well appointed and recently refurbished and an Irish breakfast to remember. What else would you need??",5,2015,12,15
204,One night stopover,"Stayed here for one night on the way to a wedding. Everything you would expect from a first class city centre hotel. The staff were extremely friendly ( as you would expect in Ireland) and the atmosphere was calm and welcoming. The fact that it is only 100 metres from Grafton Street, and therefore handy for a ramble around the city centre, is an added bonus. ",5,2015,12,15
204,Quiet Genteel vibe,"I've been here many times over the years, and it's reassuringly predictable. Good if unobtrusive service, good cocktails and the restaurant is excellent. More recently the beer selection has improved greatly which is good. A fine place to meet up in town for a few quiet ones before the madness begins.",3,2015,12,13
204,beautiful hotel centrally located,"The fitzwilliam front desk staff were impeccable. The breakfast staff were amazing and friendly. The rooms were lovely, modern design. I have to say this hotel was above and beyond what i expected. There were always front door staff available. I especially enjoyed the fresh flowers everywhere.",5,2015,12,12
204,Great Hotel,"So many great things about this hotel: Friendly staff, morning breakfast was good, awesome water pressure in the shower, very comfortable beds, beautiful facility, very little noise in rooms, they give you power adapters if you need them, great location. 

The only negative thing I could say is the temperature in our room was really hot and we had to open our window quite often. 

I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again!!",4,2015,12,09

Very courteous.",5,2015,12,09
204,Comfort and location,"Excellent hotel in great area.
The only gripe is the price.
The staff are spot on with their ready smiles.
The car park is horrid in that it is too busy.
Breakfast was served with a smile and plenty of choice

204,"Wonderful location, friendly staff",This hotel has so much to offer a nice understated entrance and such a brilliant location with fantastic staff members. It was a flying visit for me this time but the rooms are well appointed there is a street view of the park which is rather pleasant. The bathroom is also great offering a separate bath freestanding and shower so very nice if you like that which I do. Thanks for a lovely stay and look forward to returning on anothe occasion.,4,2015,12,07
204,"Good location, So so hotel",The hotel is in a good location.  And the staff are all VERY nice and helpful.   However if you are looking for a 5 Star hotel I would not recommend.  We had to change our room as our first room was quite run down. We were very shocked at its condition.   I think the hotel owner/owners need to take alook at their property.  And the bar area where we had intially planned to have a drink reception with family was not as nice as we had hoped.,3,2015,12,06
204,Great hotel and good location,"Attended a conference in Dublin and was booked into this hotel. Rooms are very comfortable The staff is very friendly and the food was generally quite good. I especially enjoyed the breakfasts. Wi-Fi was also free and quite decent. The location of the hotel is where you really score, the shopping in this area is fabulous and you are just over the road from the famous St Stephens Green 9 hectares/22 acres of beautiful green park in the centre of the city. A really great hotel and one I would highly recommend.",4,2015,12,01
204,Perfect stay,"Second time staying at the Fitzwilliam and it won't be our last. Staff make you feel incredibly welcome and important. Their friendliness and professionalism is second to none.

Gorgeous hotel in a great location. Can't fault it.",5,2015,11,30
204,Accidental Stumble into a Fabulous Hotel,"After delayed flights and missed connections, my friend and I stumbled into this hotel lucky that they still had a room available on a Saturday night so last minute. We were greeted by two very handsome young men who assisted us with our heavy bags. After a horrible day of traveling, this gesture MADE OUR DAY! The girl at the front desk was kinder than any hotel personnel I have come across before. She chatted with us about the amenities at the hotel as well as things we should see in Dublin. She then walked us to the lift and got us all set up to go to our top floor room, followed by the men with our luggage. The room was beautiful and clean and the shower was amazing! We really enjoyed the hair dryer and the slippers! The next day they allowed us to use their business center to download and print our Ryanair boarding cards for the next leg of our trip and they stored our luggage while we got breakfast. Situated in a perfect location, you are not too far from anything here. Will without a doubt be back to this hotel in my future travels to Dublin. ",5,2015,11,29
204,Pre-wedding stay,We stayed here with friends the day before we departed for Wexford for a wedding. What a great stay. The staff was friendly and nice. We asked to stay in the bar late due to American Football game starting and they were able to accommodate us. We will stay here again!,5,2015,11,28
204,Unbelievable Service!!,"I find great joy in doing research for our big vacations. After extensive research, picked the Fitzwilliam for two reasons 1) Location-Walkable to the best of Dublin and right on the beautiful St. Stephen's Green park and 2) Love a sense of humor, watch the video on their website of the guest that forgets his anniversary. The hotel met our high expectations. The unbelievable part comes after we returned home. Dublin has awesome street performers. Just down from the Fitzwilliam, we came upon a young man playing a guitar made out of an oil can. He coaxed amazing sound out of the tin can and fit the mold of a streetwise Irish lad with a hanging cigarette and some clear liquid in a bottle behind his portable power plant. After returning home and watching the video, I regretted not buying his CD. I emailed the Fitzwilliam his picture and asked if they would take my credit card, track the musician down, buy a CD and send it to me in the states. They readily replied that they would take care of it and did not need my CC. Two months went by and I received an e-mail from Patrick at the Fitzwilliam that they had checked for the musician regularly and even inquired with other street artists, but no one had seen the musician. Patrick said they would keep trying. Two weeks later (Three months after our visit) I receive a package from Ireland with guitarist Brian Lea's CD and a nice handwritten note from Patrick. Stay at the Fitzwilliam! Keep and eye out for Brian (Youtube him) and enjoy Dublin! Thank you Patrick!",5,2015,11,26
204,Weekend break for shopping,"This hotel is located at top of Grafton Street in an ideal location for doing a bit of shopping or just taking in the great Dublin atmosphere.  From the moment you arrive the staff are courteous and attentive to detail.  The lobby area is somewhat limited, but if you book here you probably intend to spend your time out and about!
The only word of warning was on the Room Service breakfast - €25 per head, for 1 sausage, 1 rasher and small sides.  There was also no milk or butter supplied, so by the time this arrived (15 minutes later) the breakfast was cold anyway!",5,2015,11,24
204,"""Excellent service""","We loved this hotel. It doesn't look much from the outside, but inside it's lovely. All the staff were very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. Fantastic breakfast choice. Great bedroom with lovely large bathroom. Good central location. Would recommend to anyone and would definitely stay there again if visiting Dublin.",5,2015,11,23
204,Stellar Location,"We stayed three nights in a modern room on the second floor overlooking Stephens Green.  We opted for the king four poster bed with a beautiful soaking tub in the bathroom.  

The location couldn't have been better and the concierge was eager to assist at every turn.  

This is definitely a boutique hotel with a trendy edge.  I loved the color scheme and non pretentious feel.  

Breakfast was ample with made to cook hot items.  

One of our highlights of the trip was dinner at Thorntons located within the hotel.  This restaurant deserves a review of its own.  

I would definitely recommend the hotel and return. ",4,2015,11,22
204,Very average,"My room was pre-booked for business purposes. 

The positives:
1. Great location
2. The room interior is well designed
3. Staff very welcoming especially at the reception and restaurant
4. Good breakfast

The negatives:
1. Room is small than expected
2. Room needs updating
3. Nothing outstanding
4. Everything was very ordinary. Definitely not a 5-star experience",3,2015,11,22
204,A very good hotel -- but fix the paint work.,"A lovely hotel in a great spot but there were big dirty scuffs on the bedroom wall -- really? At five stars? Come on now, up your game. That's the kind of thing that matters when you're paying quite high rates. Lovely bar, though.",4,2015,11,21
204,THIS is how every hotel should be,"I've never stayed in a hotel with service quite as good as this - From the concierge at the front door to the waiting staff, everyone here seems to be determined to make your stay special. Even if it's just a genuine smile from the receptionist or a chat with room service it really makes a difference. More of an experience. This is a medium sized hotel but it's right at the top of Grafton Street so you could not be more central. The bar is good and the food is great - the restaurant has a Michelin star for goodness sake. Everything you need is nearby - all the famous bars, theatres, shops, restaurants - everything. I'm really glad to see the art of five star service is still alive in Dublin, albeit with a modern, super-stylish twist. Stay here, you'll love it.",5,2015,11,20
204,Top notch.,"Check in friendly and welcoming, but at 3'oclock our room wasn't ready. Offered upgrade to a suite which naturally I was very happy to accept , escorted to the suite by our receptionist which was a nice touch . 
Fitzwilliam management all the staff we encountered are a credit to your Establishment. 
Now back to the suite it was very modern with all the necessities that you would expect from a high end hotel , two rooms with TV in both rooms , bosse radio that piped though to bedroom and bathroom. 
Breakfast was top notch with lots of choices in the cold buffet and a hot menu cooked to order. I can say the Eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine that my wife and I ordered was delicious.
Thank you Fitzwilliam for a wonderful nights stay , I will be back.",5,2015,11,18
204,Great Location & Service but too much street noise,"Super location and great service, but Superior room was a bit small and avoid rooms overlooking Stephen's green as we were on the 3rd floor and found it difficult to sleep with street noise into the small hours ~4AM",3,2015,11,18
204,The Fitzwilliam - How to discover Dublin !,"Ive been to Dublin on business many times and always felt Ive never really seen the real City. Sure - Ive done the pubs etc but never got to grips with the real Dublin - until yesterday!! The Fitzwilliam is a great hotel, with very friendly staff, good food and an excellent standard of customer service. It has a famous park across the road, the shops are literally round the corner and the nightlife a short step away.

My earlier impressions suggested that Dublin , as an old city, was a bit ""tired"". I am a happy boy - this trip totally changed my mind. The Hotel is a great place to have a short city break - its reasonably priced, the rooms are very comfortable.",4,2015,11,17
204,Relaxed service,"On arrival at hotel the receptionist was very welcoming and firendly. All the staff are very relaxed and easy going. The rooms are well furnished and the beds are very comfortable. Close to the centre of Dublin

204,Great stay in a very comfortable bed room,Stayed again at the Fitzwilliam for work purposes. This time the experience was 1st class. Rooms was very comfortable and breakfast excellent again! The location is simply excellent and the super helpful staff always on hand to help!,5,2015,11,15
204,Always enjoy my stay!,"You can absolutely not beat The location of this hotel.  It's right in the center of town, walking distance to all tourist and fun sites. Tons of restaurants and shopping are close by. And important to me – it's right in front of the luas station, which takes me easily to work.
The rooms are really nicely decorated. The bed is super comfortable and the bathroom  it's small but  nice.
 I usually have a bed and breakfast rate – and the breakfast is wonderful. Lots of options available and everything tastes great! For a small fee, it can be delivered to the room as well.",5,2015,11,14
204,proper hotel,"I have stayed at this hotel about three times a year since 2007,service is as it should be,rooms ditto,as a smoker I like the little balconies! Food excellent and Thorntons were good . Going over the road for afternoon tea is recommended but russian security guards tend to be irritating(!) Overall this hotels stands comparison with the best of Europe, one of the few who can park my Bristol nearby.",5,2015,11,14
204,Good for a short business stay ,"Location is great - you are rigging easy reach for everything in Dublin, everything is very well maintained. Nice fireplace in the lobby is a bonus especially for this time of the year. I found the water pipes being extremely noise when someone next door is taking shower. The building itself us old so I did not complain as I doubt they can do anything about it. Hotel staff is up to standard. If you travel from uk make sure you Hsbc adaptor as they do nog give them out to the rooms and you will have to wait in reception if you need to charge. Breakfast was good as well. I think I will stay again next time. ",4,2015,11,14
204,Quiet comfortable hotel close to park and shops,"I stayed recently for a few days for business. Nice quiet hotel with all amenities.  Nice and close to everything, restaurants, shops and the park.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  

Lounge was a little quieter than I would like.  Would be nice to have some sports on TV to watch when having a few drinks. ",4,2015,11,12
204,Loved it!,"What a lovely hotel... Enjoyed every minute from check in to check out... Friendly efficient staff, good sized room, fabulous food, lovely bar and a location second to none... Have stayed in many Dublin City hotels and this would definitely be up there with the best of them!",5,2015,11,11
204,Great stay,"My wife and I spent one night at the hotel.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating, the room was very clean if a bit on the small side, the view over St Stephen's Green was fabulous. The location is great, very central.  Overall a great weekend.",5,2015,11,10
204,"Good hotel, friendly staff, great location","We spent three nights in the Fitzwilliam in October and were very happy with the experience. Staff were very friendly and helpful, receptionist showed us to our room which was towards the back of the hotel. No view aside from offices from our bedroom window but absolutely no noise either. Turndown service each night with tasty chocs! Usual extras expected in a 5 star hotel such as fluffy robes, slippers, complimentary bottles of water. We were on a relaxing break so did not make it to breakfast any morning, (served until 10:30) but did get room service twice and had a bite to eat in the bar, everything we ate was delicious. The only thing we did not like about the whole place was the bar, it was utterly charmless, needs a redesign as there is great space. Also the wait staff in the bar were quite slow and forgetful. By the way no residence bar either. We found it a little too warm at night, we requested an extra sheet (bed only had bottom sheet and heavy comforter/duvet) which was provided and made for a more comfortable sleep as we could sleep under that.
 Lovely hotel, good staff but by far the best thing is the location, it is excellent for a visit to central Dublin literally steps from Grafton street and a short stroll from sights like Trinity college, St Patrick's cathedral, the National museum etc., We would definitely stay here again",5,2015,11,10
204,"Good location, lacks atmosphere","This is a good place to stay if you want to be in the centre of Stephens Green, however there isn't much Dublin charm about the place. The reception staff and the Concierge staff are fine, but the bar staff don't have much to say, and the breakfast staff don't have english as their first language. Its relatively expensive with two decent restaurants apparently, although they seemed a little detached from the main hotel. The rooms are small, even if you go up a couple of grades from the basic room. Overall there are much better and friendlier places to stay in Dublin",3,2015,11,10
204,My Noisy Stay in Dublin at a Wonderful Hotel,"This hotel was great in every respect, with one significant problem.  Street noise!  Be cautions, DO NOT accept a room facing the street (the front of the building) or you will hear the trolly and the constant yelling, cheering, clang-clang of the trolly and just people talking very loud because they have been visiting the wonderful pubs in Dublin.  The trolly stop is a big problem, as many people wait there for the trolly and, yes, are drunk and are talking and yelling.  All in good fun as they should, I cannot complain about their fun, but the hotel needs to improve the sound insulation of the windows.  ",2,2015,11,09
204,Really comfortable and warm,"I was surprised by the gift that hotel gave me every night, I slept so well and feel so comfortable with the entire environment, if I'd return Ireland one day, I will  definitely come back to Fitzwilliam hotel.",5,2015,11,09
204,Best breakfast,"Has to be the best breakfasts available from the fresh fruit and vegetable juices to the breads, pastries and cooked breakfasts ordered not buffet
Great staff and a warm and welcoming atmosphere.
Centrally located with easy access to the key areas of the city",5,2015,11,08
204,October 2015 Ireland Trip,"First of all I can not say enough about all the people who work there. They were so kind, helpful, polite and caring. The room was very nice. The location could not have been better as all Dublin has to offer is minutes away. Oh and breakfast was great. Would stay there again. Thank You Fitzwilliam Hotel employees because you deserve it.",5,2015,11,07
204,Good value - very friendly,"I spent 1 night at the hotel, my first - the Web Summit in Dublin meant my usual hotel was full. I was very impressed. Very welcoming staff, room slightly on the small side but a very comfortable bed, good shower/bath and free wifi throughout the hotel. Most importantly - good value!",5,2015,11,06
204,"Lovely hotel, great location","We stayed here for the Dublin Marathon, the hotel was a superb location and the staff amazing, nothing is too much trouble.  Breakfast was served early for those running the marathon and a gift bag with fruit and water given out which was a lovely touch.  Cn't recommend this enough.",5,2015,11,04
204,This Hotel has everything,"The check in at the reception set the tone for a great weekend in a fabulous hotel.We were greeted by the friendliest most competent receptionist that I have have come across in a long time.Not alone was the greeting friendly and warm but we were brought to the list and of floor number button pressed.
The room we were in was excellent and was everything you would expect for a 5 star hotel.Robes and slippers in the bathroom full mini bar etc.
The bar was and staff were very friendly and the bar food at lunch was very good.
The main restaurant was excellent with a good menu this is the room where breakfast was served.
The breakfast menu was excellent and not the usual run of the mill.
The location of this hotel couldn't be better.Would highly recommend this hotel.
This was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in",5,2015,11,03
204,Overnight for show at Gaeity,Stayed in this hotel as it's literally footsteps from the Gaeity. Staff were very friendly. Room was surprisingly small but very tastefully decorated and comfortable. Breakfast was nice but selection on buffet table was not as good as other hotels. Bacon was overdone. Overall great location and we enjoyed our stay. ,4,2015,11,03
204,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"We've stayed here twice, most recently in October, 2015. I can't say enough positive things about this hotel. The staff is very attentive, the rooms are comfortable and quiet, the location is perfect. Everything is just right. One of my favorite hotels anywhere. Highly recommended.",5,2015,11,02
204,superb,"superb staff , centrally located . Had a family suite with pull out bed settee and a cot in our room . Only small gripe was lift finished at 5th floor and suites on the 6th so had to carry the pram up . Was always offered help though . Will definitely be back",5,2015,11,02
204,Fitzwilliam Above all Else,The Fitzwilliam was amazing.  First of all the location was excellent and was surrounded by everything and anything you needed.  We celebrated Halloween with our Son who is 3 at the Fitzwilliam.  Days before we called the Concierge to line up having our sons costumes in the room when we arrived and Patrick made sure that it happened and we are so blessed that we were able to give our son the Halloween that he wanted.  Those costumes made his trip and the Concierge team was amazing because every day on our way out our son would stop at talk with them and tell them all about what he was doing and to show them his costumes.  Thank you to The Fitzwilliam team for making this trip so memorable for my family!  We will be back again just so that we can stay at The Fitzwilliam.  ,5,2015,11,02
204,Beautiful Hotel,This hotel is beautiful!  We decided to splurge for a couple nights and this was a great choice!  The rooms are nicely decorated and the bed was so comfortable!  Nice size bathtub in the bathroom too!  And the staff at the hotel were so nice and helpful.  They didn't even blink an eye when we walked in with our backpacks.  And the location across from St. Stephen's Green and right by Grafton Street was perfect.  I would definitely stay there again.,5,2015,11,01
204,Marathon weekend,"My husband was running the Dublin marathon and chose this hotel based on reviews and location. We were not disappointed. 
On arrival, our cases were taken from us and we were escorted to reception. We were shown to our room ( we had been upgraded but reception were subtle enough not to mention it). We had a 4th floor room with a terrace overlooking the green. Not enormous but well appointed and what is to be expected for the fantastic location. A great and deep bath which was very welcome after a 26 mile trot around the city!Splendid views in Autumn. 
We were so looked after. My husband went for breakfast early on marathon day and came back with a goody bag given to all runners. I ate my breakfast later and was made to feel so welcome as a ""marathon widow!""
The lobby area was tastefully decorated for Halloween and was a lovely place to sit and enjoy a drink. 
The breakfast staff were so friendly, professional and accommodating. Concierge were professional, knowledgable and friendly.
We ate in the hotel bar on the first night of our stay. Good food although a little disappointed that they had run out of bottles of Pinot Grigio. A minor chink in an otherwise perfect experience. 
Thank you and we hope to return to stay with you.",5,2015,10,31
204,"Perfect location, great service, great room","My wife & I spent a Friday & Saturday night in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin.  The location is perfect, the staff was outstanding, and the room was quiet and nicely appointed.  We'll definitely be back!",5,2015,10,29
204,Third Visit to this hotel,"Could never go to Dublin and not stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The location is perfect right across the street from St. Stevens Green.  Everything is in walking distance. Not a historic hotel, very modern but the rooms, beds and bathrooms are wonderful.  You couldn't ask for a better breakfast.  Expensive but convenient and delicious.  The staff is great.  The concierge, Victor is terrific. He knows all.  The hotel bar is very comfortable.  Good for a late night drink.  Now the restaurant, Thorntons is very upscale.  If your really hungry pass, but if you want some delicious and beautiful food this is the place. The beet salad and lamb were out of this world. Picked the cheese plate for desert and when they rolled over the cart I was shocked at the selection. Love Ireland.",5,2015,10,28
204,They don't value loyalty,I stay at this hotel around 10 times each year for the last 5 years and they generally give a reasonable  corporate rate. However I have noticed of late that they always quote you a significantly higher rate than you can get from sites such as Trivago. This time the hotel quoted me £460 and I got the room from Trivago for £180 so my advice to everyone is not to book direct with the Hotel. ,3,2015,10,28
204,Another great stay,"Stayed here for the marathon. Truly a 5 star hotel with friendly staff, turn down service, and exceptional accommodation. Breakfast is a great value and always a delight. I enjoy the cleanliness of the room and the quiet accommodation. Can't beat the location. ",5,2015,10,28
204,Great location and helpful staff,"A great location, couldn't fault the hotel. Rooms smaller than anticipated but tastfully decorated. Breakfast freshly made and plentiful. A little pricy for the room but set in a prime location off St Stephens square and pretty much in walking distance of the major attractions.",5,2015,10,27
204,"Great Location, Great Staff","The Fitzwilliam is in an excellent location for walking to most, if not all, of Dublin's main attractions.  It sits across the street from St Stephen's Green, a beautiful 22 acre public park, is adjacent to Grafton Street, a pedestrian shopping area, and steps from the Liffey.  In addition to the location, the Fitzwilliam staff is extremely attentive, cheerful and helpful.  From the door men to the wait staff all were very well trained.  The room was clean, quiet, large and had a big bath.  There were plenty of outlets for charging devices and bedside tables on both sides of the bed, which i really appreciated.",5,2015,10,26
204,First Class Hotel,"Not sure what to expect from the outside of the hotel as it has a very discreet frontage ,opposite St Stephens Green.
The receptionist took us to our room and although it wasn't huge it had everything that we needed.
The staff were all very friendly and helpful and really made the hotel for us.The breakfast was so good and they cater for all  tastes not just full Irish.The hotel is situated at the start of Grafton Street within easy walk of Trinity College and the City Bus Tours.
When we visit Dublin again this is the hotel we would choose.",4,2015,10,25
204,Friendly,"Very friendly and helpful staff from the check in all the way to the check out. Great at providing restaurant reservations and making some good recommendations. Good breakfast, attentive and a wonderful location.",5,2015,10,24
204,"Very nice hotel, great location on St. Stephen's Green",We stayed two nights at the Fitzwilliam and the room and rest of hotel were very nice and what I expected from the description and reviews.  All of the staff was very friendly and the concierge was very helpful with much simpler directions to reach the motorway than our GPS.  It was a surprise being from the US to find real candles and not LED candles in the room.  The candles and live orchid were nice touches.  This was the only hotel that we stayed at on this trip in Ireland (out of 5) that had wash clothes; something that I've found interesting while traveling in Europe (usually not supplied).  The location can't be beat--right across from St. Stephen's Green and near the pedestrian street that you can take to get to Trinity College (Book of Kells) and to catch the tram to the Guiness Storehouse.,5,2015,10,24
204,First class throughout,"We had an excellent stay here for three nights in Dublin. The location is as good as you can get right across from Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Family room was very nice, staff was extremely accommodating for my family and the breakfast is excellent. Great value for a hotel of this quality.",5,2015,10,24
204,Perfect ,"I've been there just for a night but I felt a warm sensation both in the hall and in the room. Kind people and very special infrastructure were making my stay a very good one. Breakfast very good, position very Strategic, just in the Middle of Dublin.",5,2015,10,23
204,Worth the splurge!,"Fantastic hotel, very clean, lovely staff (Especially Polina on reception and Magorzata in the bar)

We stayed from 20-22 October in room 351 which was of a nice size with a balcony overlooking the gardens. No disturbances at night despite the Central Location. 

Breakfast was AMAZING, excellent choice of hot dishes made to order.

Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2015,10,23
204,Fantastic hotel excellent staff,This hotel has an excellent location.  The concierges are incredibly efficient and polite one of them has worked there 25 years.  i had them confirm my airport transfer they got a recording saying that number was wrong.  i booked a taxi and sent an email to booking agent. when i went out concierge told me they had call and would be there on time and that he had cancelled taxi.  They are so friendly and polite it makes you want to stay forever.  the hotel is very nice.  I highly recommend it.  Carmen C.,5,2015,10,22
204,"Comfortable, convenient and stylish","We enjoyed a deluxe premium room here which was spacious and well appointed. Check in and check out was quick and efficient. It was quite noisy outside (we had a view on St Stephen's Green) but to be expected in the city centre.  
Staff were welcoming and hospitable, great location. 
Recommended. ",4,2015,10,18
204,Mid Week Break,"My husband  and I stayed here for 1 night in September.  Staff very friendly at check-in, the receptionist took us up to our room.  Our room was at the front with a great view of Stephen's Green and was also quiet at night.  We had a great nights sleep, bed was very comfortable.  The room, though small had everything we needed.  It was spotless, we really enjoyed their music system as it was piped into the bathroom.  Lovely to relax in the bath and listen to classical music.

We didn't have an evening meal, but we had breakfast in our room which was good.  

The hotel location is brilliant for shopping, restaurants, bars, etc.  I would recommend this hotel to family and friends.  We will stay here again when in Dublin.",5,2015,10,18
204,"Great location, modern upscale, pleasant staff","The location of the hotel was what appealed most to us. It is across from St. Stephen's green and on Grafton St. Easy walk to history sites, top restaurants and stores. Trinity College is about a 5-10 min walk depending on your pace. It could get a little loud because of proximity to things, but the noise outside died down after 1 am-ish.
The staff was lovely and helpful. I had tried to make reservations at the restaurant, Farm (very good, btw!) through their email form while I was still in the USA. However, the restaurant never responded with a confirmation. Luckily as soon as we arrived at the Fitzwilliam on check in they asked right away if they could help with dinner arrangements. 15 minutes later they called up to our room with a reservation for that night!
The rooms are nice, but the basic rooms are small. This didn't bother us so much as we aren't traveling to stay in our room. There is a coffee and tea maker in the room as well as a mini bar with complementary bottled water. Though, it's an automated mini bar, so if you move a bottle of something you pay for it! That tends to annoy me as sometimes you pick something up on your travels and would like to put it in the frig, but can't as of fear of getting charged for something.
Breakfast is very good. A spread of meats, cheeses, breads, cereal, fruit and yogurt, and they will pretty much make you anything you want eggs wise.",4,2015,10,17
204,1 night stay in Dublin,"We had a very nice stay at the Fitzwilliam!  Beautiful hotel and very friendly reception and concierge services.  Very clean and aesthetically pleasing hotel!  Highly recommend!
This is hotel is close to everything and within walking distance Stephens Green.  
",5,2015,10,16
204,Good location fast wifi ,"Don't know if it is the best hotel, but room was comfortable. Only one receptionist at noon but she was fast and took time to explain and point out places to go on their map. Fast free WiFi. Put them to the test. My room had a broken toilet seat and blood on the shower curtains. Complained and returned to the room and everything was changed. Located close to shopping area and lots of restaurants. Extra little touches seen throughout the hotel. ",4,2015,10,15
204,A must stay,Best location and among the very best staffs. Concierge service outstanding. Hotel well kept and with full amenities. Well worth the money. We would have no problems returning to this hotel on subsequent visits to Dublin. Highly recommended.,5,2015,10,15
204,Wonderful Service,"Very nice hotel, rooms are pretty with window seat and modern bathroom. What separates it is the service, truly exceptional. Patrick was great giving tips where to go and where to eat.  The desk staff got reservations at restaurants and rescheduled tours when our plane was delayed.",5,2015,10,14
204,Perfect,"A perfect place to stay right in the middle of Dublin city. A very comfortable hotel, and you are made welcome from the minute you set foot in the door. It's luxury all the way, from being shown to your room to bath robes and slippers in the room. The view over St Stephens Square is lovely. Overall the perfect place to stay",5,2015,10,14
204,Ideal central location in Dublin,"The Fitzwilliam hotel has an ideal central Dublin location on Stephen's Green, at Grafton Street. It was about 25 minutes drive from the airport during mid-day and ~10-15 minutes to the Hueston train station in Dublin. Staff is friendly and efficient. They are well prepared to advise you about restaurants and sites in the immediate area, and there are a multitude of excellent restaurants in easy walking distance, not to mention the 1 star Michelin restaurant, Thornton's, right at the hotel.
We had 2 stays at this hotel, both times in a Deluxe Premium room on a higher floor. One room looked into the central garden and the other looked out on the street facing St. Stephen's Green. The rooms and beds were comfortable with a 4-poster king bed, but overall I would not consider these luxury rooms. The bathrooms were small, with a single sink, and although they were adequate, the bathtub showers were poorly executed resulting in water covering the bathroom floor with each shower. Our first room had temperature control problems, but the second room was fine. There was little noise, even with the room that was facing St. Stephen's Green. Wi-fi speed was excellent, but we had occasional problems getting connected. TV's were adequate, with an acceptable choice of Irish and European channels.

We ate once at the hotel restaurant, Citron, and cannot recommend it. We had breakfast which included an average buffet as well as hot items ordered through the waitstaff. For the quality of food, they were way overpriced - over €20 per person for a mediocre meal (and watered down coffee). Breakfast at other restaurants in the neighborhood was much better and less expensive choice.  We did not eat at the other hotel restaurants - Thornton's (the Michelin starred restaurant) or the casual dining bar, Inn on the Green.

The hotel room prices were consistent with the other centrally located luxury hotels, but I'm not sure I would consider this a true 5 Star experience. However, the location cannot be beat!",4,2015,10,14
204,Weekend Break....,"Excellent hotel.  Staff were friendly and helpful ay all times, especially those within the Citron Restaurant at Breakfast.  Clean throughout and was provided with room overlooking St Stephens Green as requested.

Would definitely return to this hotel in the future.",5,2015,10,12
204,Great location,"This was a good find.

Location: very central, good transport links, quiet enough.
Rooms: pleasant, comfortable, individual touch (not too corporate), good selection of TV channels!
Service: good
Good wifi connection (top marks!)

Would certainly consider staying there again, when in Dublin.",4,2015,10,11
204,Paul,"A very enjoyable stay at this 4 star hotel in Dublin.  A great location and with friendly (but professional) staff. The rooms are everything you would expect in a quality hotel. The shower is is to die for with a shower head that is more like standing under a waterfall. Finally, the breakfast was probably the best I have had in a hotel. The chef cooked Eggs Florentine was absolutely divine. ",5,2015,10,10
204,"As always.... Excellent Service , Ideal Location and will keep on coming back",This was my fifth time staying at the Fitzwilliam over the last few years. My husband and I  always come to Dublin for one night during our trip home to visit family.  We have stayed in other hotels in the city but keep on going back to the Fitzwilliam.  It is the Perfect location in the city center.   The staff are knowledgeable and very helpful.  Rooms are clean and well decorated.  We always enjoy the breakfast  buffet and our cocktails in the bar each night.  We will definitely be back .,5,2015,10,09
204,"Great location, helpful staff, and comfortable rooms","Directly across from St. Stephen's Green (similar to NYC's Central Park), the Fitzwilliam Hotel is the ideal setting for a first-time visit to Dublin. The staff are extremely helpful, the breakfast is delicious, and the beds are comfortable.  Just a few steps off Grafton Street, you can walk to the Temple Bar pubs, the Tara train station (which takes you to the small villages along the Irish Sea), and to the central shopping district.  Wonderful location.",5,2015,10,08
204,Delightful in everyway,"The Fitzwilliam is a gem of a hotel near St. Steven's Green. Lovely rooms, fabulous staff, great food and outgoing service for all their guests.
This hotel made our stay, a wonderful warm welcome from check-in to departure.  The staff is exceptional and we will always remember Dublin fondly due to their genuine care for guests. Great value too!  ",5,2015,10,04
204,Really great stay!,"We had stayed at the Fitzwilliam 4 years ago and loved it, but after reading the poor reviews on TripAdvisor, I was worried.  So, I can emphatically say: dismiss them!  We had a great stay.  Our rooms were facing St. Stephen Green, which is noisy when the windows are open, but in a friendly kind of way, and with a great view of the park and its lush trees. (As compared to 4 years ago, the nightclub next door is closed down.) The huge bathtub was a delight, especially since I've had an injury that requires lots of hot soaks.  The internet was fantastic - reliable and fast, always available.  The concierges (especially Patrick and Martin) were truly outstanding and great at booking everything for us, including a rental car delivered to the front door of the hotel. The free breakfasts were pretty darn good with lovely coffee. And we loved sitting in the lobby reading, either by the fireplace or in the reading nook. In fact, our daughter was stuck in Dublin an extra night at a subpar hotel she booked last minute, but she went back to the business center and lobby of the Fitzwilliam to work the entire next day - because the internet is great and the public spaces inviting. The location also is fabulous: ten minutes to everything!",5,2015,09,30
204,Right off Grafton St.,Nice business hotel...downtown.  spent 3 days in Dublin. nice staff. Staff gave us very good recom. for pubs and dinner. Super housekeeping service. Easy to everything in Dublin.It has parking garage attached [tho I would not drive in Dublin. :),5,2015,09,30
204,Excellent hotel in perfect location,My wife and I stayed 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam hotel and it could not be faulted. From the moment we arrived the service we received from every member of staff was first rate. Coupled with its excellent location this is definitely a hotel we will use again on next visit to Dublin.,5,2015,09,28
204,"Excellent Place, Excellent Location","On entering this hotel we knew immediatly it was going to be an excellent stay. The front of house staff were very welcoming and attentive to every detail we had requested, of which there were a few! The rooms and the facilities were all very relaxing and we were not at all disappointed with any aspect of the hotel. Food, Drinks and 
Service was to a very high standard. These coupled with the perfect location on St. Stephens Green made our trip to Dublin exceptional. ",5,2015,09,24
204,Not a five star experience,"We have visited this hotel a lot over the last 15 years.
We have noticed a deterioration recently . The service was hit and miss. The bar area was disappointing .. More like an american sports bar. 
The rooms are many and varied , some with tired decor . 
Breakfast was  spectacularly average . 
",2,2015,09,22
204,Impeccable Service,"This hotel is sublime! It is very apparent that all staff throughout this hotel are very well trained and continually retrained, as they are all extremely attentive yet understand to respect the rule of space so as not to be invasive. From check-in to checkout hospitality is abundant. Hotel rooms are well appointed, have all the required amenities, are extremely clean and well maintained. Terrific breakfast provided and a friendly bar. The property is perfectly located in Dublin to access all areas of the city with ease. All ground transportation options are available right outside of the front door which the very attentive doormen will coordinate without needing to ask.",5,2015,09,22
204,Nice hotel,"Great rooms, courteous staff & great breakfast. In a central location in dublin. Close to lots of fine dining establishments, with a very reasonable rate. Proximatey to coppers is also a bonus for the match day reveller. 
",4,2015,09,22
204,Perfect central location,"This is a great hotel in a perfect location. It's really central for shopping and all the sights. Loads of great eateries close by too. Staff are friendly and helpful. It was really busy when we were there so a glitch or two but mostly quick to resolve so no complaints. The decore is pleasant, rooms well equipped with free wifi. A little pricey but a good option in Dublin.",5,2015,09,22
204,Perfect,"This hotel was perfect in every way... location, price, service, food, business center, rooms, etc.  This hotel is in the perfect location for business and pleasure - and right next to the relaxing St. Stephen's Green.
      ",5,2015,09,21
204,Helpful beyond words,"I arrived here with an injured knee. They were so helpful with my room placement and my luggage. I was to meet my husband in three days time and was basing myself for 5 days at the Fitzwilliam.  As a solo injured traveler they could not have been more accommodating to begin with and then they surpassed themselves.  I don't know how I did it but after the first day I threw out my back. Really badly. (I know I sound like a traveling mess :)) I could barely move from a horizontal position on the bed. Here is when they stepped in. They went to the pharmacy for me! Got me some pain cream and an ice bottle/bag. The old fashioned screw top kind! They then kept me in ice for the next two days and considerately looked in on me. I got room service and surfed the internet. Not the way I usually travel but it was so appreciated. Yes they also have a great breakfast and the rooms while on the small size are not micro. They have a nice window bench a beautiful orchid plant, tea pot with tea and coffee. I had a lot of time to examine the room! Oh and the tub nice and deep with plenty of hot water (to soak my back). Yup ice the first two days and hot water soaks for the next three. OH and I splurged the first night at Thorntons, which I can also recomend.",5,2015,09,20
204,"Great location, very good restaurant, rooms clean but a little noisy.","Excellent location across from St. Stephen's Green with a really good, Michelin-starred (but casual) restaurant in the hotel. Hotel is not phenomenal in terms of amenities, but clean and modern. Only two complaints: a little noisy (room doors all seem to slam) and some issues with the shower, ran out of hot water for some reason.",4,2015,09,19
204,Perfect in Dublin,Excellent service from the moment I arrived by cab when my car door was opened as soon as the cab pulled in front of the hotel. That set the tone of the entire visit. Concierge was always enthusiastic & accommodating. Drinks from the bar were excellent. Breakfast was delicious. The beds were very comfortable and rooms were designed in a Irish contemporary style. Great value. ,5,2015,09,16
204,ALWAYS SO RELAXING,"We have stayed in the Fitzwilliam on several occasions on a night away and it never fails to please. From the gorgeous cocktails in the bar, to the beautifully appointed rooms and the excellent breakfast, it never disappoints. The staf are among the most friendly and welcoming that we have ever encountered. All in all, we could not recommend this highly enough.",5,2015,09,16
204,I wanted to love it...but I can't,"booked this hotel due to close proximity to city center and also wanted a nice refuge from the trad B&B one finds in Ireland.  It was the most expensive hotel stay we had over two weeks - and the bed was the most uncomfortable one ever.  It was so bad I actually slept on the floor instead of the bed. in hind sight, I should have said soemthing - but it is hard to work up the courage to do anything at 12am when you finally realize how mad the bed is.  It literally sagged in the middle.  on the positive side, room was exceptionally clean and the staff was helpful.",1,2015,09,15
204,"Psychedelic decor, cramped rooms","Really very poor supposed five-star showing by the Fitzwilliam.  Tiny, dark and ugly rooms with bizarre decor.  Adequate service, but wildly overpriced - in spite of the excellent location.  Lousy gym offering too.  Disappointing compared to its direct competition.",3,2015,09,15
204,Central Dublin Gem!,"Tucked away off Grafton Street on St Stephens Green is a gem of a hotel called Fitzwilliam! Stayed on the recommendation of my travel agent Kathi Sheridan and I was not disappointed. This property was the last stop of a 12 day jaunt through Ireland for 5 adults.
Wonderful experience from the time we pulled up in front of the hotel. Every need was attended and the property was home for two nights. The front desk and door crew are the best. 
One recommendation is to enjoy the afternoon tea! Absolute wonderful experience.I would stay again!
",5,2015,09,15
204,Best hotel in Dublin,"Stayed here many times on business. 

Staff are lovely, rooms are great and peaceful.

Only downfall I think is the food which is hit and miss. Burgers often come out soggy and sandwiches are always coated in mayo. If they could improve the food it would be the perfect place to stay.

Very central being on the green.",4,2015,09,12
204,"Expensive,but well worth it!","Stayed 2 weeks and the hotel and staff were great.In the center of Dublin,it's near(within walking distance) much of what you want to see. it is near transportation and tourist offices if you want to book tours.Staff exceedingly helpful and competent, and the hotel has a very classy, quiet and elegant atmosphere. Wish the rooms were better lit and the lobby more spacious, but these are not major drawbacks. Robes and slippers provided, and large umbrellas available at front door, which are especially required in Ireland.And it's adjacent to a very nice indoor shopping center as well as a T.G.I.Fridays for American food.Free WIFI in rooms and business center.Even chocolates in the evening delivered to your room.",5,2015,09,09
204,A detour to Dublin,"That's how it felt as we did not have enough time in Dublin. The Fitzwilliam was superb and located opposite the beautiful St. Stephens Green. Within walking distance to Trinity college, which I am sad to say we did not get to see due to lack of time and close to the hub bub of Dublin's thriving city life, we had as good a time as we could, given the rain and our poor planning! The staff at the hotel were friendly, helpful and efficient.",4,2015,09,09
204,Last night in dublin,"We stayed here our last night in dublin. The location is very good right off of grafton street and across from St Stephens green. You can walk anywhere you want to go. Our room was clean, up to date and good size. I only have two complaints.
1. Walls are thin- our neighbor woke up at 5am and we could hear toilets flushing, water running and hair dryer blowing.
2. The bar staff is very rude.( see further review there)
We would stay here again though, and would recommend to friends.",4,2015,09,09
204,Fabulous hotel in central location,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel for a night to celebrate our silver wedding.  From the friendly welcome when we arrived to the helpful concierge when we left it was a most enjoyable experience. The room was comfortable and peaceful - hard to believe that you could step out to the middle of a bustling city.  Breakfast was of good quality.  Overall, a very good experience and would recommend the hotel for a luxurious city centre break.",5,2015,09,08
204,Great Stay!,"Family of four (teens). Great hotel and close to everything. Breakfast was great daily and excellent people all around. A few issues with wifi that staff corrected asap. Would recommend that anyone stay here - close to Grafton, St. Stephen's Green, etc. and a short walk or cab from most Dublin attractions.",5,2015,09,05
204,Urban Gem,"A funky but comfortable hotel in a superb location at the top of Grafton Street. Despite it's central city location it is quiet and relaxing. The food was very tasty in the range of restaurants. Lobby area's cozy with fires and beautiful flowers and art. Lovely toiletries in the bathroom, along with tea-coffee making facilities, robes and slippers, iron and ironing board and really comfie bed and pillows. We will definitely stay again.",5,2015,09,04
204,Beautiful Hotel,"Very nice hotel from the outside which carries on throughout.Upon arrival very efficient ,helpful and friendly staff.
Rooms are decorated to a very modern high standard with VERY comfy bed.
Food and staff in The restaurant fantastic. 10 out of 10 
Not too far from main shops, 10 min walk .",5,2015,09,03
204,Lovely hotel on St Stephens green in Dublin,"The Fitzwilliam is in the perfect location if your visiting Dublin and looking to walk to restaurants, shopping and pubs.  The hotel is not very large compared to American standards, but just the same it is very pretty, its clean and modern.  The staff could not possibly be any nicer or more helpful.  We were not familiar with the city and arrived after 9:00 PM on a Thursday, the concierge called several places looking for a reservation for us for dinner and due to his relationship with a restaurant he was able to get us a table for 10:30PM, and when we arrived they were expecting us.  I recommend staying at the Fitzwilliam if your in Dublin, you will love it.",5,2015,09,01
204,a 5 star memorable experience,"After spending 12 days on a tour of Ireland, I had booked 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel as the grand finale. It was the highlight of my trip.
From the time you are greeted at the front door until the time you leave, the staff will make you feel that you are the only guest that matters.
You can tell that everyone takes pride in being a part of an exceptionally run, first class hotel.
We had breakfast at Citron and some meals in the Pub. The food was excellent and the waitstaff were professional and friendly.
The rooms are very comfortable and nicely appointed. The location by Grafton Street/St. Stephen's Green makes it very convenient to get around.

If you are planning a visit to Dublin, I can highly recommend the Fitzwilliam.
It is a very special place to stay.",5,2015,09,01
204,Amazing!,Great service and luxurious and clean room. very big selection for breakfast and the food was good. The hotel is in a good location but it is not too noisy in the room. I love how every single detail was taken care of. I will definitely be back.,5,2015,09,01
204,"Fabulous place to stay - well situated, warm and kind service in all belongings and rooms in which you can happily relax","We spent three nights for our visit of Dublin city and could not have made a better choice - modern, kind and friendly service in every respect - abundant breakfast buffet - outstanding service and food at the Thornton Restaurant - all in all contributed this place to a wonderful holiday trip! We shall return to The Fitzwilliam for another visit to Ireland!",5,2015,09,01
204,Again simply outstanding in every respect.  Only place to stay in Dublin,"Back for a weekend at the Fitzwilliam.  It never fails to impress.  Outstanding in every respect, courteous and very professional staff, great facility, amazing room with view over the Green.  Excellent location.  Only place to stay in Dublin.",5,2015,08,31
204,"Great location rooms, exceptional service","We stayed at the FitzWilliam our last night in Dublin. Its location on St Stephens Green at the head of Grafton is perfect. We found the room, pub restaurant, and breakfast area to be welcoming and excellent. The hotel has a modern and contemporary feel. What distinguished this hotel, however, was the service. Josefina checked us in at the front desk in the lobby. She then escorted us to our room, explained its features in detail, and was friendly and helpful throughout our stay. She knew us and made us feel valued as customers. We have never experienced this level of service from a person behind the check-in desk. The conciereges were friendly and helpful--especially Victor. We stayed earlier in the week down the street at the Shelbourne and had a far better experience at the FitzWilliam.",5,2015,08,30
204,Fantastic!,"Stayed for a night in the Fitzwilliam on our way back from touring south and west Ireland. It was a fabulous last night choice. First class service from the concierge team, sumptuous room and excellent location.  The beds were so comfortable and just had to have a bath in the beautiful bathroom. The also managed to get us into Sophie's restaurant that night as well after my attempts had failed!  A top hotel - will be back.",5,2015,08,30
204,Amazing location and great stay,"This hotel was lovely!  Right on St. Stephens Green and walking distance to great shopping and eating.  The rooms are beautiful and the staff is so nice.  When my US electrical adapter broke, they actually went out and got me a new one so I could charge my phone and computer.  Fabulous place!  ",5,2015,08,28
204,Hotel Location ,Great hotel. The rooms are a bit small but overall it is an amazing hotel. The staff here are very friendly. It's right beside St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. Ideal place to stay for a few days visit because of all the available services nearby. A bit expensive but that's understandable due to its strategic location.,4,2015,08,28
204,Wonderful purple style and comfort in central Dublin,"We recently spent two nights at the Fitzwilliam.   The room was very stylishly decorated, roomy enough for two people and very quiet as it overlooked an inner courtyard. The bathroom was well appointed, spotless, with a great shower.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and responded to all requests promptly.  There was a good choice at the breakfast buffet and room-service breakfast was good as well.  I would definitely return to this hotel for it's location, the comfort and the efficiency of the staff.   I loved everything purple about the decoration!",5,2015,08,27
204,Disappointed :-(,"When you boast 5 stars, you have to step up to the mark, if you disappoint your customers, you'd better make things right and I'm afraid they didn't even try! When I arrived there was no one at the door to help with our luggage, even though there was three door people when we went out, there was no valet parking available, our room wasn't ready until 3.45pm, all easy to recover if they wanted to?
However the reception staff were lovely, the hotel is lovely and the food we had in the hotel was very good. We did get a note off the manager asking if we wanted to ""discuss the problems?"" However we were there for 1 day, they'd already eaten into our shopping time, so we didn't take him up on it. No comments at check out, we didn't  pursue it further, however if the manager had came out, that would've been the perfect opportunity to put things right, however, he didn't, sounds petty maybe, but when you pay those prices, you expect what they advertise. Well I do anyway, I won't be back. Plus the blog we are writing on our tour of Ireland won't be advertising staying in this 5 star accommodation, as so many other hotels do it better!!!",3,2015,08,27
204,A modern little gem off St Stephens Green,This hotel is in a great location. The concierge was extremely helpful and the rooms were nice. You're not going to get a large room but they are well appointed. Breakfast in the morning was also very nice! The H20 bath products were good! We all talked about how soft our hair was! Again this hotel for us was all about Victor at the concierge desks recommendations. He just nailed it for us and went above and beyond to be helpful!,4,2015,08,27
204,"Great Business Hotel, Superb Location","The Fitzwilliam is located on Stephens Green just off Grafton Street, The main shopping district id Dublin.
Superbly located. Nice size rooms. Great Service.  As in all 5 star capital city hotels the world over, the bar and restaurant are a little over priced especially for those travelling on a restricted budget however if that isnt a consideration for you then The Fitzwilliam is an ideal base for a Dublin break.",5,2015,08,26
204,Great rooms and staff,"We only had a single night stay in Dublin, but we are very happy we stayed here. I can't really fault it on anything. However, we did not eat in the restaurant so I cannot review the food or experience there.",5,2015,08,25
204,Great Location,The Fitzwilliam Hotel is a lovely hotel in a great location.  Rooms are well decorated and a good size.  The breakfast was very good with a great selection and the food was an excellent standard.  I would recommend this hotel and can't wait to return.,4,2015,08,25
204,Fantastic Stay Heart Dublin,"This is my second time staying in the hotel. Last time was work, this time with my wife. The rooms are always of a high standard. The staff are exceptional and welcoming. Restaurant food is very good. I always feel my visit to Dublin is special when I stay in this hotel. The locations is perfect for my needs, shopping, meeting friends, etc. Will book this hotel again next time visiting Dublin. ",5,2015,08,24
204,value for money,"No elevator to the small 6th floor rooms. This rooms are very small for a five star hotel. Parking for extra money. Staff wanted to leave us - 5 people - with all luggage in the lobby with rain outside. We had to ask for help and valet parking.
      ",3,2015,08,24
204,Great Staff,"The staff were very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. The first time we stayed there, at the beginning of our trip, our room was on the fourth story, with long staircases. We requested a change to a lower room for the end of our trip. The staff helped with luggage and providing other things we needed. The rooms were very small and crowded, though they were clean. The location is close to St. Steven's Square and many tourist sites. Overall, the value for the dollar/euro was less than average. There's a good restaurant just around the corner for breakfast.",3,2015,08,22
204,First class,"This was our first visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel and we were not disappointed, I had rang earlier in the week to check regarding parking and to order a bottle of bubbly for my partners birthday and our room was surprisingly upgraded. The room was fantastic, spacious and well appointed. Check in staff were great, concierge parked the car for us and brought cases to our room. Hotel is in a great location at the top of Grafton St, great for shopping, restaurants and bars! Hotel breakfast was fantastic and all staff were very attentive. We will definitely be booking here again!! ",5,2015,08,20
204,Location Location location,"My wife and I stayed for one night on 17 August . I had  alerted the hotel  at booking stage that it was my 64th birthday.  In my room was a welcoming plate with Happy Birthday  in white  chocolate plus some complimentary chocolates. Nice touch! Had requested a quiet room which was  assigned to the 5th floor overlooking inner court yard. Room was not overly large but was of the standard  advertised and more than acceptable for the money.   Room had  a mall mini bar fridge  with complimentary  mineral water. Staff were  particularly friendly , helpful and attentive. Breakfast is served on the M  floor. Waiter had noticed that my wife had not finished her egg benedict  because the egg was slightly runny. He  appologised  and offered to serve a replacement explaining that eggs will be cooked to order.  My wife  thanked him  for the offer  of a replacement but  respectfully declined. The hotel scores on location  at the top of Grafton Street with the abundance of shops and pubs. Under ground parking at the hotel costs 10 euro and represents excellent value. Downside with the one way system in Dublin getting to the car park takes a bit of determination! ( not the hotel's fault)",4,2015,08,19
204,First Class,"While touring Ireland, my wife and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for 3 nights.  Two at the beginning of our tour and one at the end.  The hotel is conveniently located near shopping and restaurants.  The entire staff from the desk personnel to the concierge are very customer service oriented and made us feel so welcome. Breakfast is included and includes a nice selection of breads, muffins, cereal, fruit and juices. A full breakfast menu is presented upon your arrival and is complete with a variety of breakfast selections. The room is well furnished and very comfortable. Our bathroom was very clean with modern fixturing.  We would definitely consider staying at the Fitzwilliam again upon returning to Dublin.",5,2015,08,18
204,Good Location ....and a few other recomedations,"Good standard hotel - not your plush 5 start experience , more of a comfortable modern business hotel with some very good staff but the location was great. Room was perfectly reasonable on the second floor with a view of the neighbouroghing building. Breakfast was excellent and service staff there alway very welcoming and proficient. Bar staff not quite up to the same but concierges were very visible and prove which I found very good. A room overlooking the park/St Stephens green would be most pleasant Im sure.

The ""Dandelion"" cafe bar next door was deemed "" a bit young fro us "" by the taxi driver that dropped us off but as it turned out it was a good crowd ...Sinnics round the corner was a bit more boisterous and had more of an edge to it so may one to avoid. I won't list all the pubs we tried as that is very much a personal preference but if you aren't sure then a wander down to temple bar, ideally running parallel to grafton street rather than just trapsing up and down it all the time, might be worth considering as there are lots of areas  and side streets we found this time that we hadn't seen on previous visits just by actively looking to wander a bit off the main thoroughfare.

Best day by far though was the trip to Howth on the Dart/Train. Loverly spot by the sea, superb Seafood restaurant (s) we went Aqua and had stunning lunch of super fresh well cooked Seafood and a view to die for.....worth a trip back to Dublin and the Fitzwilliam alone.",4,2015,08,18
204,Great location in the heart of dublin,"Can't say enough great things about the Fitzwilliam.  It was in the heart of Grafton street and convenient isn't to public transportation.  I came here with my daughter for a special trip and they made us feel special.  Our room was a welcome oasis after each day of sightseeing, with a deep tub and relaxing atmosphere.  I will be recommending this hotel to many.",5,2015,08,18
204,Outstanding Hotel,"Loved this place.  Friendly check in and check out. Front office team were brilliant in responding to small requests such as extra towels  to room etc.
Every single member of staff encountered was exceptionally friendly and professional.
Had dinner and breakfast included included in rate, availed of both and found the standard of food and service to be excellent.
Bedroom was very plush, in particular  the bathroom. Very comfortable bed, black out blinds and a very quiet room. What more could you ask for!
Wifi was free and fast
Felt the bar and restaurant looked a bit sterile and did not match the Cool/plush factor in the rest of the hotel, however, this probably just a matter or personal preference.
All in all, great hotel, will definitely be back.",5,2015,08,16
204,Very helpful staff,The hotel was very comfortable and the staff was extremely helpful.  They suggested places that we ended up being very happy with.  We were more interested in going where the locals go instead of ending up in tourist traps and they helped us achieve that!,4,2015,08,16
204,Nice hotel in a great location,"I picked this hotel for its location and its high customer service ratings.  It is within walking distance of many Dublin tourist attractions and is adjacent to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street.  We were only at the hotel 2 nights and didn't really give the hotel an opportunity to show us the 5 star service they were known for because we literally used them for a bed and shower which were both great.  We had already planned on having breakfast at Hatch & Sons and we hit all the famous pubs near the hotel as well as the Temple Bar district for lunch and dinners.  I feel like we dumbed-down the Fitzwilliam experience when they have a Michelin Star rated restaurant at the hotel and we chose pub food instead.  Regardless, I will stay at this hotel again for its location over any other reason.",4,2015,08,15
204,Terrific Hotel,"We booked two rooms for two nights as part of our family tour of Ireland. This is a terrific hotel that we all enjoyed. The hotel staff contacted us in advance and was very accommodating for our early check-in. They were most pleasant and professional throughout our stay. The rooms were spacious, clean and very comfortable. Our breakfast and dinner at their restaurant were excellent as was the waitstaff the atmosphere and the bar as well. The hotel is centrally and conveniently located with easy access to all of Dublin's major attractions. Will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2015,08,14
204,Boutique luxury,"Welcoming, friendly staff. Comfortable rooms, complimentary tea & coffee, well equipped ensuite with the best power shower! Breakfast was well worth the short wait in the busy restaurant. Only down side was tea and coffee in the restaurant was weak and tasteless. Ask for a cappuccino or a latte instead - at no extra cost - not shown on the menu!
      ",5,2015,08,13
204,Enjoyable stay,"Nice modern hotel in a fabulous location. All the things you need, a good comfortable bed, good quality linen and towels and bathrobes, a good sized bathroom with both shower and a large bath with nice toiletries.
We were on the 6th floor and the lift stops at the 5th so if you cannot manage stairs that is something to bear in mind when booking.
As mentioned in a previous review, the corridors are quite dark but no more so than in a lot of hotels and lets face it you don't spend any time in them other than to get from A to B so hardly a deal breaker.",4,2015,08,13
204,"Great location, very nice hotel, wonderful rooms!","We flew in to Dublin at 8:30AM. Got to the hotel before 10:00AM. Oh, well, the room was not ready.
They offered a gratis breakfast (excellent) and ""a day room"" to refresh.... We were so looking forward to a shower and stretch. We were taken to a ....bathroom! No windows, no ventilation, very hot. Not exactly what you are looking for after a long flight. Granted, we came before check-in time.
So, we took a shower still sweating:))... and went on the town. Managed to see Trinity College and the famous book before our eyes started to close... went back to the hotel, checked in (very nice room, no view of the park) and collapsed on bed and slept for a couple of hours. The service was excellent, friendly guys from Eastern Europe manned the lobby, reception and concierge. The location of the hotel is so great that you don't have to take a taxi at all. Hop-on-hop-off bus is around the corner. The St. Stevens Green (Park) across the street. We loved being there, just don't come in too early:))",4,2015,08,12
204,First Class,Stayed here for 2 nights and booked two other rooms for family as my wife's new book was being launched nearby. Hotel is very clean and the room we stayed in is one of the best I've had in Ireland. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and I cannot fault any part of my stay here,5,2015,08,12
204,Great option for Dublin stay,"Stayed here with a friend for two nights at end of week-long stay in Ireland.  Could not have been happier with location and overall experience at hotel.  Friendly, professional staff.  Nicely appointed room with comfortable beds and large bathroom.  Breakfast was good with friendly, courteous staff.  Only complaint was room was small and awkward for two adults.",5,2015,08,12
204,Disappointing ,"I had no intention of writing a review until I learned the high cost of this hotel for a very poor experience. The corridors are poorly lit to the point of being dingy and as we were on the 6 th floor meant having to walk up as the lift stops at 5. The room was small but clean. The lobby is tired and was not very clean with the hotel having no decent area for breakfast. This is in a very dull mezzanine space which overlooks the reception area. I had an omelette, probably the worst I have had served, as it was pancake flat, chewy, tasteless and lacking any springiness. I nearly marched into the kitchen to tell the chef to read up on Auntie Delia's methodology.  My husband's scrambled egg was stringy and overcooked. His first pot of tea was like dishwater but was apologetically exchanged when pointed out. The coffee was ok! At 370 Euros for the one night this was altogether very disappointing. ",1,2015,08,10
204,Unbeatable,"Impossible to fault the staff at this excellently located hotel. 
From the warm welcome on arrival to friendly farewell our expectations were met and exceeded, a huge factor in our enjoyment of the visit. We spent five nights here, dined at Thorntons once and the very helpful concierges, particularly Marcin Jura, recommended other great places to dine.
Had a good bedroom, very clean, lovely comfy bed with quality bed linen. We overlooked   St Stephen's Green, as requested. It is noisy out there at night, lots of party  animals, but we expected that so no complaints.
The only irritation in room 401 would be very squeaky floorboards outside the bathroom door. 
Cannot recommend this hotel too highly. ",5,2015,08,10
204,Fabulous hotel,"We won a night away here so I was very excited to stay. We were warmly welcomed upon check in and walked us to the lift which was a nice touch, The room was very contemporary and elegant similar to the rest of the hotel, the bathroom had a luxurious feel with the bath and the Paul Costello products. the bath robes and slippers were a nice addition! We had the yummy late afternoon tea in the inn downstairs, Matt served us and we were very impressed with his professional yet friendly attitude, he is a great asset to the bar and has an impressive knowledge of whiskey and the cocktails!   The hotel is in the middle of everything so we went for a walk down Grafton st.  Breakfast was included the next day, the selection and quality was delicious very much a boutique brunch",5,2015,08,10
204,Great stay,"My friend and I had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam. The location and service are excellent.  Our rooms were comfortable and well-appointed, though small.  It was fine for us as singles, but it would be tough for a couple.  
I was incredibly impressed with how quiet the hotel is - the only noise I heard was from the seagulls, which was lovely.
I really wish the curtains completely covered the windows - brutal when you have jet lag, and it's light outside from 5am-10pm. All else was great, including the value.",4,2015,08,09
204,Excellent Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Excellent service, well appointed room.  We really enjoyed our stay and the staff were helpful and assisted us whenever needed.   We were especially touched when the front desk staff actually escorted us to the room to make sure all was as we wanted it to be.",5,2015,08,03
204,Nice but no pool,It was very nice but there was no pool and breakfast was not included. I think that all hotels need to have breakfast included. The wifi was okay. It was surrounded by shops and had easy access to the city. Overall a really nice hotel,3,2015,08,02
204,Great Hotel,"I went with my wife for a one night stay. She loved it so I was happy. The food was nice and ALL the staff were so nice to talk to. Anything at all we wanted was not a problem. We will be back again, my only regret was not having more time to spend in the hotel.",5,2015,08,02
204,DO NOT STAY HERE FOR BUSINESS!,"I've stayed at this hotel multiple times for business. Although beautiful and located in the heart of Dublin, basic essential needs of a business traveler are beyond poor. I've had to stand at the door of my room just to get wifi. With top pricing the room should have amazing lightning fast wifi. How is one suppose to work without simple Internet? The hotel staff at best are apathetic to any and all concerns including basic requests such as more towels and pillows. I travel to Dublin multiple times a year and finally after a few stays here, I will be taking my business elsewhere and also telling all of my colleagues to avoid the Fitzwilliam like the plague. Five star hotel, I think not - more like two stars based on the lack of quality for guest concerns and for not accommodating even the simplest request such as having functioning wifi in the guest rooms.",1,2015,08,02
204,"Great stay, superb service","We spent 2 nights here, having flown in to Dublin from Philadelphia. They were able to accommodate us immediately, which was wonderful after an overnight flight. The room wasn't really big, but it was comfortable and well provisioned. The one negative is that the Wifi in our section of the hotel was poor- we were all the way at the end of the hallway. We sometimes needed to go to the lobby to get good connectivity.

The location could not be better. You can walk almost anywhere south of the Liffey with no trouble, and there's all kinds of public transit available. It's across the street from St. Stephen's Green, which is lovely.

Breakfast was excellent, but what really made the hotel great was the service. The concierge staff was superb. They were helpful in every way possible and made our entire stay more enjoyable.",5,2015,08,01
204,Glad we stayed,"The Fitzwilliam is a very nice hotel in the heart of Dublin.  Location was great, staff was very helpful, breakfast was really good.  Only thing I would say is that the rooms are little on the small side.  Other than that we really enjoyed our stay.",4,2015,08,01
204,Great place and ideally located for a good stay in Dublin,"I enjoyed my stay at Fritzwiliams! location is awesome as its close to shopping and work. Great facility for decent price. Recommend stay as its a good place!

Rooms are good, a bit tight though but considering how much you spend in the room when on a business trip. Rooms may be tight for more than one person in a group, but good for single person.
      ",5,2015,08,01
204,Fantastic,"Lovely hotel, very good staff. Really enjoyed our stay. Room was small but well decked out and quiet. My mother arrived early and they had the room ready by noon, even brought her up and showed her the radio etc so she had a nice rest before I arrived. Breakfast was excellent.",5,2015,07,29
204,"Fantastic staff, lovely boutique room","Well located directly on Stephens green. Room small but beautifully designed. Bathroom stunning. Nice of cute features. 

Breakfast nice but not a huge selection. Staff were very helpful and gave me a nice box and bag so I could take some breakfast away with me as I was in a rush",4,2015,07,28
204,Well priced and good location ,"Stayed here as the Shelbourne was booked out. The Staff were friendly and room price was good. The room was an ok size and quite modern. Check in and check out was fast.
Worth staying for a night to go shopping as its on Grafton street so central.",4,2015,07,27
204,"Superb, great place to stay","My wife and I visited the Fitzwilliam on Friday for a 50th surprise visit. We had a fantastc stay at the hotel. The staff and surroundings were simply fantrastic. We loved the hotel and were made to feel extremely welcome. 

The staff could not do enough. The hotel retains the charm and friendlyness that one would expect from Ireland whilst maintaining the professional attutude that one would expect from a 5* hotel.

During our stay we ate at Thorntons and it was faultless! Best resteraunt that we have eaten in. In fact we are thinking about flying in again just to eat with Kevin and his team soon.
",5,2015,07,27
204,"Great location, solid building and rooms",The hotel is across the street from the park and within walking distance of many Dublin attractions.  It's also adjacent to both the city bikes self-service racks and green line of the LUAS light rail.  The hotel has a touch of chic to it and the staff seem enthusiastic about helping guests (although often tourists do wait a bit for attention).  The breakfast is quite good.,5,2015,07,25
204,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel, walking distance to all the sites in Belfast. The rooms are amazing and the staff are very helpful with any questions. I would not stay any where else if I were to return to Belfast. The breakfast is very good, the concierge service is amazing, they are helpful and very friendly and answer all questions no matter how small.",5,2015,07,25
204,Superior Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is a modern hotel in a GREAT location at the foot of Grafton Street, a major shopping destination.  It's within walking distance of all the major Dublin City Center sites (e.g. Trinity College and the Book of Kells, Christ Church, and Temple Bar).  We were greeted warmly by the staff who answered questions and provided information on how to navigate in the city.  The concierge went the extra mile to try to get us good tickets to Riverdance on a last minute request which is emblematic of the kind of service the hotel provides.  When we had trouble logging in to the internet at 11:00 p.m., staff came up and resolved the issues within fifteen minutes.  This would be our first choice for a hotel in Dublin and we would be very happy to clone it and stay in it in other cities.",5,2015,07,24
204,Best Location to do Dublin,"On the edge of St Stephen's Green, this is an excellent location to explore Dublin.  Walk out the door and just go!  The park, museums, Grafton Street with all of its Pubs, restaurants, and shops.  You cannot go wrong if you stay here.  Well maintained, 5 star rooms, a great staff and a Michelin Star restaurant right next door!",5,2015,07,22
204,Spectacular Property & Location!,"Our stay at the Fitzwilliam was absolutely perfect. It was our first stop on our visit to Ireland.  We arrived from an overnight flight at 8:30am and were thrilled to learn our room was ready! Luke (he was awesome) checked us in, familiarized us to all the amenities and personally walked us to our room.  The room was stunningly appointment--very modern, but warm.  A fresh orchid even adorned the space...and the bathroom was truly a gem.  Even the TP was of superior quality! Great breakfast options, absolutely perfect location--right on St Stephen's Square and directly beside Grafton.  Right in the heart of the action, but not busy as it's neatly tucked around the corner from the main thoroughfare.  Staff were friendly and welcoming.  I would not stay anywhere else upon returning to Dublin.",5,2015,07,21
204,Great Hotel,"Having stayed at the Fitzwilliam previously, it was our obvious choice of hotel again for our 3 night stay last week.
A lovely hotel in a very good location, close to restaurants, shops, theatre and St Stephens Green.  
The concierge at this hotel are outstanding.
We will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,07,21
204,Superb modern style,"This is a classy modern 5 star hotel overlooking St Stephen's Green which is perfect for a morning stroll. Location is spot on, close to every attraction in the city. We visited to celebrate our anniversary and the staff left us a note and chocolates in our room. Excellent service and very cool decor. I will return here for sure",5,2015,07,21
204,Afternoon tea,We came to the fitzwilliam for afternoon tea and it was fantastic. Staff were absolutely lovely and friendly.... One of the poshest afternoon tea experiences I've had and I certainly will be back... We had our own private booth and we felt as ease and comfortable while there.,5,2015,07,20
204,Weekend stay,I have to say we couldn't fault our stay in the hotel. We stay regularly in 5 star hotels and the service given by all the staff was at the higher end. Only negative was the size of the room that we had over looking the park but this was mentioned to us upon booking. Overall very satisfied.,5,2015,07,20
204,Wow! Just great!,"The Fitzwilliam was a perfect place to stay in Dublin!  It is located right across from St. Stephen's Green, and at the top of Grafton Street! It was a very special hotel! What a treat! We had a beautiful room overlooking the lovely roof garden! The staff was wonderful! Fun, informative, and so helpful! Loved staying there!",5,2015,07,19
204,Stylish and central,"This is a lovely place to stay in Belfast. The hotel is very cool and originally decorated and our room, a superior room, was gorgeous with a great view over the city.  
The hotel is also in a great position, a short walk to all the sights.   I would stay here again. ",5,2015,07,19
204,Just brill,"Our stay at the Fitzwilliam was for my partners 60th birthday.
We arrived early afternoon and parked the car. As we got out a very friendly Concierge was there to assist with the bags.
On arrival to check in a very pleasant girl called Lena dealt with me. As our room wasnt quite ready she gave us a complimentary drink from the bar. This was very welcome after 2hrs driving and just started our celebration off on the right note. 
When we arrived to our room there was a personal note left with chocolates wishing us a great stay for the occasion. Lovely touch i thought.
We went out for dinner and on return there were chocolates left on our bed and the room had been tidied.
The breakfast was amazing and something to suit every palate. The staff once again were extremely friendly and helpful.
From the moment we arrived till we left the whole experience was great. 
Well done to everyone. Lena you were wonderful. Thank you. Everyone deserves a huge thanks for making our celebration special for us.
Well done.",5,2015,07,19
204,A Truly Five-Star  Experience,"Perfection realized: the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin.

From the receptionist who walks you to your room, to the chambermaids' cheery greetings as you pass in the halls each morning.

The attentive bartenders, the breakfast staff who make everything just perfect.

Viktor, who with his fellow concierges can get you into a restaurant:  chic, or royal elegant, or point you at a pub offering delicious Irish stew and a pint for nearly nothing.

And avuncular Tony who can instantly get you a replacement personal tour when the original car has an accident.

Yes: it is walk-out-the-door close to shops, buskers, St. Stephen's Green, and Trinity College.

But it's the staff who make the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin truly a five-star experience.",5,2015,07,18
204,Great service and Location,"Spent 3 nights in July. Very efficient and helpful service. We had a deluxe room overlooking the park. Other than the fact that you have to climb out the window to access the balcony (safety concern?), it is nice to have outdoor space. It was very noisy in the day due to street performers on the corner and the tram bells, but at night we shut the windows and it was very quiet. Nice little seating area, a modern bathroom with nice toiletries and a safe, minibar/fridge rounded out the lovely accommodations. Breakfast was good with a decent choice of buffet and hot items. We had room service one evening and it was very tasty, although some creative type decided to put ice cream on a slate slab so it melted all over everything. The bar staff were very nice. We would stay here again.",4,2015,07,17
204,Great location and style,"Stayed here a number of times, held company meetings and dinners, family and friend functions and lunches. Consistently good service. The bar is my favourite. Citron restuarant maybe more 4star than 5. 
Fantastic bedrooms, cool purple and dark wood combo.
The best is the location!",5,2015,07,16
204,Great location!,"The location can't be beat if you want to get out and see Dublin. It is within walking distance to everything. Staff are very friendly and will make sure to get you anything you need. We had the balcony room and while the rooms are pretty small, it's worth it for the location. ",4,2015,07,14
204,Excellent Hotel in an Unbeatable Location,"My wife and I stayed here for one night recently as part of an anniversary trip (our third visit). The location really is the best in Dublin; St Stephens Green is beautiful and there is a good selection of excellent restaurants very near by.

We were upgraded to a really stunning room with a balcony looking out over St Stephens Green - very nice of the staff. They also left us some congratulatory petit fours and a card; a lovely touch. The room (a Deluxe Queen) was a great size, very comfortable bed and generally excellent amenities.

I had a couple of perfectly served pints in the bar, and the staff very accommodatingly whipped up some strawberries and cream for my wife (no on the menu). 

We had a slightly questionable restaurant recommendation from the concierge, but both he and the manager dealt with it very professionally when I spoke with them about it.

The other quibble was that our breakfast failed to arrive, despite our having telephoned room service the night before to specifically explain that we had an early flight to catch so needed it to arrive on time. It arrived around 10 minutes before we had to leave for the airport so we only had time wolf down half of it (the half we ate was delicious and the front desk removed the charge for breakfast when I mentioned the problem at check out).

The hotel is really lovely, and we will certainly stay there when next in Dublin. There were a couple of service hiccups but the way the hotel dealt with them impressed me. Every establishment occasionally gets things wrong – they way they handle it says a huge amount about them and the Fitzwilliam could not have dealt with them more professionally.",4,2015,07,14
204,Home in the City,"When travelling to Dublin, we were looking for comfort and location in the heart of the city.  The Fitzwilliam, delivered both in spades.  The accomodations were wonderful, and the location could not be any better to see Dublin in style.  The staff were the most helpful and cheerful we experienced on the entire trip. ",5,2015,07,13
204,"Nice property, great location","The location simply cannot be beat. That said, I found the hotel a bit pricey for what you get (a smallish room) and for what you don't get (a continental breakfast). 

I would probably stay again for the location, and for the spa service (great massage, check it out).",4,2015,07,10
204,Fantastic hotel,"I recently stayed with friends at the Fitzwilliam and it is a fantastic hotel. The location was just awesome, right on St Stephens green and round the corner from Grafton street so you couldn't ask for a better central location in Dublin. The hotel staff where very helpful, especially when we came in at 3am after AC/DC concert. They sorted us out with some food and more drinks, could ask for more. The rooms where lovely, my only complaint was that I didn't really have time to spend more time in the room as I had an early start. Breakfast was very good and it's served in a very nice area just above reception. I was worried that being in central Dublin the hotel might be noisy at night but this was not the case. Would definitely stay again.",4,2015,07,10
204,We were sad to leave,"We enjoyed Fitzwilliam Hotel, very good breakfast (although a bit loud in the low room) nice rooms and very good service. The location is great (for shopping and visiting and you have a nearby park across the road.",4,2015,07,10
204,Great hotel,"Great location, large room for European hotel, very clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good, but gets crowded at peak hours (to be expected). Very good coffee. Really enjoyed the bar at night and the friendly bartenders. Would definitely stay here again and recommend for this price range.",5,2015,07,09
204,Engagement,I have just returned from an overnight stay in this fabulous hotel on Monday 6th July 2015.  During this stay I got engaged. The hotel staff were amazing! They're professionalism and kindness where second to none!  I've never wrote a review for a hotel before but felt compelled to write this following the excellence of service from the fitzwilliam hotel.,5,2015,07,09
204,Great location and service.,"The service from the minute you walk in to the time you leave is 5 star. The room decor was perfect and the fresh tray of desserts waiting for us upon check-in was simply delicious. The bathroom was spacious and full of useable toiletries. Breakfast was included in our stay. They offered a small buffet of fresh fruit, meat and cheese and had a full menu to order from.",5,2015,07,09
204,Most Enjoyable Stay,"The Fitzwilliam exceeded our expectations! The location was ideal and very centrally located. The rooms were lovely - updated, quiet and comfortable. The breakfast (not included in our room rate) was very good and well worth the price to start our day! We are very happy we chose the Fitzwilliam for our stay in Dublin.",5,2015,07,08
204,Excellent hotel in great location,"We stayed here 3 nights in Dublin.  The rooms were excellent, the location was great (right next to St. Stephens Green 1/2 block from Grafton street and about a full block to Trinity Collge) and the service could not be beat.  Cant say enough of how comfortable we were at the Fitzwilliam.   We arrived early Saturday and toured till we got a a call that our room was ready at 12pm.   Took a nap and when I woke up I noticed the bathtub was huge, so I took a great big bath that was awesome.   I am a bigger body so it was great getting such a comfortable tub.   We had breakfast included each morning and it was buffet and you could made to order eggs.   You cant go wrong here.",5,2015,07,07
204,Smart and central Dublin hotel with great service,"We loved our two nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in June. This is a smart, modern and classy hotel with a boutique feel and great decor. The location is superb, overlooking St Stephen's Green and very central. Terrific bar and restaurants. The standard of the service lived up to the hype on the hotel's website and could not have been friendlier. The wifi wasn't great but concierge went out of there way to try and sort it out for us. It wasn't cheap so loses a point for value and would have been nice to have access to the outdoor space upstairs but no complaints.",4,2015,07,06
204,perfect location,"We stayed for 5 nights in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin. We chose it for its central location and it was just perfect. Trinity College, shopping and nice restaurants just a few minutes walk and St Stephens Green at the other side of the road.
Even though we arrived slightly earlier than the official check-in time, our room was ready, check-in was very quick, our suitcases arrived immediately. 
We had specially asked for a room with a balcony and views to St Stephens Green and that is what we got. The room was clean, modern and nicely decorated  quality materials, including a 4-poster bed. It had all amenities one might need plus free WiFi, ironing facilities, waterboiler for coffee and tea, trouser press. On the negative side, the room seemed a bit smaller than promised on the internetsite, even if the small balcony would be included in the square meters. Furniture and glass items were slightly chipped, which does not give a 5-star feeling. Entrance to the balcony is a bit surprising: one has to climb onto a stool to get through the window and has to mind his head as there is no normal balconydoor. Definitively not suited for persons with balance disorder. But still, the small balcony is a nice place to sit and overlook St Stephens Green.
Breakfast was included in our room rate and we really enjoyed it. All fruits were very fresh and the choice of hot items more than sufficient. The breakfastroom does not seem very large, but even though the hotel was more or less fully booked during our stay, it did not feel overcrowded. Most of the waitstaff was very smiley and helpful.
Same goes for the congierge and reception, everybody really seemed to enjoy his work. A problem with internetaccess was quickly solved.
One thing to note : we were extremely lucky with the weather and therefore wanted to sleep with open windows. As our room was overlooking St Stephens Green, we heared people partying outside in the street almost all night. If noise bothers you, choose a room at the courtyard. Normally we never take courtyardrooms as we had very unfortunate experiences with that type of room in the past (plain wallsight, aircons in front of the window, hardly no daylight), but this hotel has a lovely large courtyard with trees and plants and lot of light, so in this hotel we would not mind having a more quiet room on that side.
Although the hotel is not really a bargain for what it offers, we had a very pleasant stay and would choose again in future.",4,2015,07,06
204,Disappointing Room and Stay,"We had a very small room that was directly on the front of the building.  As the front of the  building was a main thoroughfare where all of the young collegiates collected and drank all night long at the bars, our room proved to be a very noisy one.  If you go to this hotel, please ask for a room not overlooking the front of the hote.",3,2015,07,06
204,Disappointing,"The wifi was very slow. They did not restock the minibar. The breakfast is not very good and room service breakfast was greatly limited. The outlet did not work. The service was good. The rooms and lobby nicely decorated. Overall nice, but not exactly what you would expect for the price. ",3,2015,07,05
204,Lovely contemporary hotel by St. Stephen's Green,"The hotel is lovely.  Decor is contemporary - very pretty although not breathtaking.  Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped.  Staff is extremely attentive and helpful.  Breakfast was included in my rate, and the breakfast served was very nice.  The location is just off Grafton Street, so an easy walk to great shopping and sightseeing.  Parking garage is underneath and easily accessed.  Hotel charges extra if you are parking a vehicle.",4,2015,07,03
204,Great location in the city centre,My husband and I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel. The location is great just a short distance from Graften street and overlooking St Stephens green. The rooms are comfortable and quiet. The decor is chic with very comfortable bedding. The staff are friendly and polite. Breakfast has a good choice of healthy options with a choice of hot food available to order,4,2015,07,01
204,Very Nice Stay,"We stayed for three nights in this lovely hotel.  All the staff was friendly and helpful, and breakfast service was fast and efficient.  My husband enjoyed the pants press in the room.  Absolutely no problems with the WiFi, which is always a good sign.",4,2015,06,30
204,Lovely one night stay ,"Had quick trip to Dublin for my partners birthday and chose here to stay 

Stayed on a Sunday night , room not ready when arrived earlier in day from airport but left our bags with concierge and  they called us when room was ready - great service 

Room wasn't huge but modern and comfortable , my request for champagne in room on arrival was all sorted and a platter of birthday chocs were delivered shortly after we got to room 

Turn down service was unexpected but added a nice touch as did delivery of complimentary newspaper in the morning 

Staff all very friendly and efficient ",4,2015,06,29
204,Perfect for a short stay,"I stayed here for one night before flying out of Dublin. Check in was quick and easy, the room was a good size, very clean and modern, the bathroom was also very clean, the WiFi was quick and free and the staff were very helpful with an early morning check out. It was very quiet and the location was right in the middle of everything.",5,2015,06,27
204,"Not 5-Star, but still very good. ","This is a small hotel with a simple facade. There is only one floor for guests. On the day we visited, there was no doorman, but efficient concierge and quick check-in helped smooth things out. 
The room was smallish, but tastefully done and well equipped. The free wi-fi was fast and stable. Interestingly, unlike our hotels in London, this place has a complimentary mini-bar with an electric kettle, a trouser press and an iron. The bathroom was clean, with all the amenities we wanted. Staff left some chocolates in the room after turn-down service. All very good then! 
But, on closer scrutiny, the hotel shows plenty of signs of wear and tear. Worn and stained bathroom tiles, fraying carpet, chipped and dented mini bar cabinet, etc. In short, it's due for refurbishment. 
The staff were good though. Fiona, who checked us in was friendly and efficient. Patrick and Ross were the nice chaps from concierge who helped us with our luggage. And finally, the lovely Lucia at check-out who made me fall in love all over again (and possibly migrate to Slovakia). 
Finally, the location of this hotel is excellent (it's surrounded by numerous shops and dining places). St. Stephen's Green is right in front of the hotel, while the River Liffey is a short walk away. Indeed, many of the main attractions in Dublin are located very close to this hotel. 
An excellent choice if you're in Dublin. ",5,2015,06,25
204,great location,"just accross the street from the park

seems like a new hotel

rooms are well decorated, but smallish

wifi is very spotty

air conditioning only worked for 20 min at a time- we talked about this, but no difference

staff is eager and helpful",4,2015,06,25
204,Top Notch!,"The Fitzwilliam is a fantastic hotel located on St. Stephens Green near the shopping center of the same name and the Grafton Street. The staff is some of the best around, especially the concierge Patrick who was extremely pleasant and very helpful. If you stay there definitely utilize Patrick and the gents at the concierge desk. They will not steer you wrong!  The rooms were well appointed with quality features, such as stereo sound in room and the bathroom. The Fitzwilliam is a marvelous hotel and we'll be back on our next trip to Dublin!",5,2015,06,25
204,Disappointed ,Arrived on Saturday. Reception Upgraded us to a suite which was nowhere near the quality of the original room I had booked. Went to the bar ordered something quick food and 2 cocktails. Food arrived 30 mins from order.  2 burgers. Still no drinks. Asked bar man. They were in middle of making them. 15 mins wait to the bar again. No drinks. I then asked for a bottle of wine at the bar. Barman says no problem we will bring it to the table with the cocktails. 20 mins went by. At this stage we were waiting over an hour for 2 cocktails and a bottle of wine. Got fed up complained to bar manager and left. They refunded food and offered an extra night. Terrible experience all together for a top quality hotel. ,1,2015,06,22
204,Short Stay,"We regularly stay in another Dublin Hotel at the opposite end of the park but on this occasion it was fully booked. We we not disappointed with the Fitzwilliam Hotel and I am sure that we will return.
It is very well situated for Grafton street and the many restaurants and coffee shops on the South side of Dublin. Th room was comfortable and well equipped. The small business room is air conditioned. The staff from Concierge, checkin, and dining room were superb. A first class Hotel.",5,2015,06,21
204,Great Central Location,"The team really look after all your needs and the rooms are well appointed. Central to all that Dublin has to offer the Fitzwilliam is a great place to stay. The breakfast has a large selection to cater for everyone's needs.
      ",5,2015,06,20
204,Perfect Service and Staff Tomas Kreml,"We started our trip to Ireland in Dublin, and we checked in and decided to get a drink and the bar.  We loved the quaint and comfortable bar, and we were immediatly greeted by Tomas Kreml.  He was a very professional and provided the best service we had ever seen.  We were so impressed, that we visited him multiple times during our stay.  We ended up touring the South for a 5 more days, and return to the Fitzwilliams Hotel mainly because of Tomas.  The Hotel is perfectly located to shopping, landmarks, placing to eat.  Tomas was amazing, and helped us find places of interest.   He makes the best drinks I've ever had.   I highly recommend this Hotel, and don't forget to meet Tomas, you won't be disappointed!",5,2015,06,19
204,Excellent Hotel in Dublin,"From arriving by taxi and being greeted by Patrick at your door was like welcoming us home again.
We first stayed at this Hotel in 2014 and liked the staff so much we decided to stay again on our next visit to Dublin.
Keep up the good work Patrick.
The breakfast is also of a very high standard Kevin and his team are very friendly and the service is very great and efficient.
The bar at ground level which we have enjoyed both times for light meals and drinks is excellent, Jenny who we have been lucky enough to be served by on both occasions is wonerful she is always so happy it rubs off on you, we are looking forward to seeing her again.
Our next trip from Australia to Dublin will include another stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel keep up the good work team.",5,2015,06,19
204,"Great location, great staff.","Very pleased with this hotel and staff. The rooms were a bit small but very comfortable.
Concierge service helped me with contacting my cell service provider in the U.S. to gain international service.
Breakfast was great at this hotel.
I would recommend this hotel to friends and family",5,2015,06,17
204,"Lovely hotel, good location.","Staff were friendly and professional. The room, although it only had a view of the internal courtyard, was spacious and well appointed. The location of the hotel is central to most things Dublin. Breakfast was very good with a good selection. It was raining and the hotel even had umbrellas ready for guests. its nice to see a hotel that thinks ahead. I'd stay here again.",4,2015,06,16
204,Just enough room to swing a cat!,Well having spent one night at the Shelbourne and four at Powersourt on this my first break following 4 heart attacks and open heart surgery I was looking forward to sampling the Fitzwilliam. Met by lovely helpful and courteous staff the room brought me down to earth with a big bump.Had dinner in the room but nowhere to eat it so had to rest tray on bed. The smallest double room I have stayed in so won't be rushing back!,3,2015,06,12
204,Constantine saves the day!!!!,"Recently, six weary travelers from the USA enjoyed our last two nights in Ireland at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin. I want to say first that every facet of our stay was lovely, we were so very well taken care of! Our early morning departure for the airport on May 30th found us there on time, but I had accidentally left my cell phone in the hotel lobby. Constantine to the rescue! After my initial panicked call to the front desk to investigate how I could retrieve the phone prior to my flight, Constantine handled the entire situation with calmness and aplomb! He whisked outside to find a super honest cabbie, and handed over the phone with instructions as to how to find me at the airport! I had that phone back in my possession in just 23 minutes and Constantine even called it afterwards to confirm its delivery. Constantine is a truly dedicated employee and a real asset to your business. Thank you for a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin.",5,2015,06,10
204,Nice accommodations in great location!,"The Fitzwilliam is a boutique hotel with sleek modern decor. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were beautifully decorated, with a spa like bathroom. Everything is clean and well maintained. Being in the heart of the city, you might expect lots of noise, but double windows kept it quiet inside. Daily turndown service includes chocolates!
The front desk staff was friendly and accommodating. The gentlemen at the concierge desk were so helpful. We were a group of 26, so I spent a good deal of time sorting our dinner plans and Viktor was terrific!
The location is good, at the heart of Dublin and short walking distance to shopping and tourist centered Grafton street. Trinity College is about 5 minutes walk from the door.
The restaurant provides good service and pretty good food, but I would not give the restaurant itself 5 stars. Jack, the head waiter, was a standout, while several of the other servers would rather have been elsewhere. The food was okay, but there's better to be had during your stay in Dublin.",5,2015,06,09
204,Superb Stay,"I stayed one night absolutely loved this hotel!! The room was small but the views over Stephens Green were stunning. I found the staff most helpful, the night porter was a little grouchy but it was after 4 when we arrived back. The breakfast was delicious, I am only sorry I choose to go elsewhere for dinner.",5,2015,06,09
204,Favorite hotel ever,"first greeted by the jolly doormen, and the reception actually took us up the room to acquaint us with the specifics.  Breakfast one of the best of our 2 weeks through Ireland and Scotland. All employees went out of their way to be friendly and paid attention to every detail in a jolly manner, making us feel so welcome that I never want to leave !!  The bathroom is the best planned in our trip so far, from the small details like placement  of the makeup mirror and the Kleenex box.  The rain shower like a waterfall in a fantastic way. Can't wait to come back and stay for a week. Best location. Shopping and gelato right outside door.",5,2015,06,08
204,Two nights in Dublin,"Solid and reasonably priced choice for higher end accommodation in expensive Dublin. Spent two nights here in a signature room. Comfy with nice sized bathroom. Staff were welcoming. Concierge seamlessly handled two dinner reservations for us without having to check up on them. Location is super convenient to tourist attractions and day tour busses. Wifi is fast and reliable, bar has all the local stuff and is efficient. Went for a quick run around St Stephens Green early Sat morning. About 0.8 miles for each outer  loop for runners or walkers out there. ",5,2015,06,08
204,Good choice in the heart of Dublin,"Overall: very friendly staff (concierges!) with 1 or 2 exceptions, very well exquiped rooms, great location to explore the city, good food (breakfast!).
Reservation, room size and gym could do better.",4,2015,06,08
204,Lots of greats...,"Perfect and beautiful location. But a short amble from the Luas stop outside and a slightly longer amble to retail, bar and restaurant heaven. The staff are super friendly and the hotel is very well presented. 
Breakfast in the hotel was easy-peasy. Lots on offer: continental, as well as cooked. They did an omelette pretty well too. 
The room was nice: all the mod cons, sockets well placed and everything worked, including the shower. Only mildly annoying thing: the curtains were not wide enough to meet in the middle so I was woken each morning at 5am to beaming sunlight. I did mention this to the reception desk. 

All in all, definitely stay here if you can.",4,2015,06,08
204,Great location,"Next to a huge Park  and close to Trinity College this Hotel was ideal to visit Dublin.
Easy walk to the temple bar area . Rooms were small. Good wifi. The staff were helpful and efficient. It is next to Grafton street which is filled with stores, places to eat and no cars. We took a walk in the park-Stevens Greens-reminded me of Central Park in NYC.",5,2015,06,06
204,Lovely hotel in fantastic location,"We stayed 4 nights at the Fitzwilliam.  My husband had a business meeting for a couple of days and we later learned that the rest of the group stayed at a less centrally-located hotel.  I was so glad we stayed at the Fitzwilliam instead.  

The location was perfect:  right in the middle of the city (or at least in the middle of the things a tourist might want to walk to), and across from the lovely St. Stephen's Green. Even though the hotel was in the middle of the action, it felt quiet and peaceful on the inside. 

Our rooms (we had two because our adult son joined us for the trip) were stylish and impeccably maintained -- including the daily maid service which I thought was excellent at this hotel.  The decor was more interesting than the usual and quite nice -- a couple of the reviews on TripAdvisor have said that it was tired, but that was not our experience at all.  Our room faced the courtyard and our son's room faced the Green -- both were quiet.  Next time I would ask for a room that is closer to the elevator -- our room was quite a distance down a long corridor.  The wifi service was also not the best -- sometimes it was fine and sometimes it wasn't.  But these minor inconveniences did not detract from the fact that the rooms were wonderful to come back to every day after our outings.

When I booked the rooms, I got a package that included breakfast.  The breakfast was lovely (the best items were off the menu) and the service excellent, but next time I might opt for having breakfast at one of the local spots.  There were so many options in that corner, and I got a little bored after a couple of days.

The service was incredible.  When we checked in, the person who checked us in walked us to our room and showed us around -- even waiting while we greeted our son  (who joined us in Dublin from the city where he lives -- he got there a few hours before we did).  The concierge team was fantastic.  We had wanted to go on a tour to Newgrange, and when the tour was full, they recommended a cab driver who did an amazing job -- a less pricey option than a typical driver.  There was always at least one person at the concierge desk, and always someone free to help us -- including running down the street and around the corner to find us a cab if there wasn't one sitting in front of the hotel.

We have stayed in so many good hotels over the years, but the Fitzwilliam, which is perhaps  slightly less over-the-top luxurious than others, is one of my favorites ever.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,06,04
204,"Wonderful staff, great location and large bathrooms.",Right near the green and near Grafton street. Very convenient location. During the weekend it was noisy from the bar (plus we were only on 2nd floor). Quick room service. Comfortable bed and nicely decorated. Would stay here again!,3,2015,06,03
204,In the Heart of Dublin on St. Steven's Green,"We had three (3) nights left on our family holiday in Ireland and what a great way to finish this memorable vacation then at a memorable property like the Fitzwilliam Hotel! The staff, accommodations and location could not have served us any better. When we come back to Ireland, we will definitely make it a point to spend some of our time, in Dublin, at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Everything about this property was spot-on, but the most important aspect was it's central location to everything in this great city!",5,2015,06,03
204,"Excellent service, decent rooms & great events team","I stayed here just last week for two nights for business. I actually arranged a conference to be held there and the team were great. Very helpful Events team (specifically Aoife) and everything went very well.
Hotel is in a good central Dublin location - shops a 2min walk and plenty of restaurants and bars nearby
Service was fantastic at the hotel.
Rooms were nice, good size and typical of your usual 4 star hotel I would say.
I would stay again and will definitely use this hotel again for an event.",4,2015,06,01
204,"Average value, good location","The hotel is well located. Service was mostly good although be careful having important documents delivered to the hotel. They are left in full site of everyone with the concierge desk often unattended...not at all secure. Even worse was that our documents weren't registered in the concierge system when delivered several days prior to our arrival so, other than my physical search through they would not have been found. 

The wifi was inconsistent. A lot of the time we had to keep re-logging in on the same devices.

Rooms were small for the price. Overall it was okay but  I would stay at the Merrion or Shelbourne next visit.",3,2015,05,29
204,Amazing place for rest...recuperation....sightseeing.......shopping.......and nightlife,"I booked into this hotel when visiting family in Dublin and thought be a very good base and it is for sightseeing...shopping...nightlife etc etc all walkable.
I was pleasantly surprised from the start...........friendly welcoming staff from the moment I arrived and continued throughout my 4 day stay.  
After a long drive I decided to have  a massage with Ursula....highly recommended I felt so much stress and shoulder ache just disappear.........so decided to get a facial the next morning too and again it was fab....definately be back for more:-)",5,2015,05,29
204,Met up with friends here,"Friends were staying here so I joined them. Great hotel. Fantastic location. When we needed to hire a car, one of the companies delivers the car right to the door of the hotel. Very convenient. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,05,28
204,Charming hotel with outstanding service,"From the moment we walked in the service at this hotel was exceptional.  We arrived early.  Jonathan found us a vacant room that was being cleaned and then took our luggage up to the room.  He called my cell once the room was ready.  Housekeeping came twice daily and did a thorough job.  The staff in the restaurant and bar were excellent as well.

Our room was a decent size with a tempting window seat for reading or viewing the courtyard.  The bathroom was spacious with a nice shower.  

The hotel is in a prime location...on St Stephen's Green within steps of Grafton St.",5,2015,05,27
204,My Home in Dublin,"I've stayed at the Fitzwilliam during various business trips to Dublin over the last 8 years.  

I have tried other hotels but prefer the Fitzwilliam because of the central location, excellent service, and modern, well lighted rooms with comfortable beds.   

St. Stephens Green directly across the street is the perfect refuge from the city or after a busy day.

",5,2015,05,27
204,Excellent luxury hotel - great service,"Stayed in a suite at the fitzwilliam the night of and the night before my wedding (we married at a non hotel city centre venue). The hotel, the room and staff all helped make the occasion extra special. Highly recommended.

The room - the suite has a bedroom and separate lounge. It is located facing a courtyard / garden and so was quiet and private (the alternative would have faced St stephen's green). The room was ideal, providing enough space for getting ready for the wedding. The room is really well appointed with high quality furnishings, in room entertainment and a really comfy bed. The hotel had chocolates and a fruit platter waiting for us. The bathroom had a nice standalone bathtub and separate shower - all the high quality furnishings, bath products, robes and soft towels you would expect from a five star hotel.

Breakfast was a mix of made to order cooked foods (really nice full Irish) and buffet foods. Everything I ate was delicious.

The service was excellent from a very efficient and friendly checkin to the speedy check out and arranging of taxis. The staff were always great at recognising and acknowledging us as guests which makes you feel valued and welcome. They were also great to arrange light snacks for my wife and family while they were getting ready - I missed out there as I had to return home to do my own preparations.",5,2015,05,27
204,Amazing Hotel,"This was my first trip to Dublin and I experienced nothing but greatness from this hotel.  The food, the staff, the location were all perfect.  Highly reccommended if you are going to be in the area.  It was 5 star for sure.",5,2015,05,27
204,"Great service, perfect location, beautiful decor","One of the most pleasant experiences on a hotel stay. Location couldn't have been better, right next to the St. Stephen's Green, within walking distance to shops, theaters, museums, pubs, restaurants. The staff was welcoming, very courteous, and always available to provide the high class service. The decor is very cheerful and modern with a very refined choice of colors, with fresh flowers and green apples offered not only on the main lobby but also on each floor. The room was sparkling clean when we checked in and that's how it was maintained through our one week stay. The restaurants on the premises are first class. Not to be missed is the Michelin starred Thornton's restaurant.  We highly recommend this hotel to savvy travelers. Congratulation to the staff and the management for providing a great place to stay and fully enjoy!",5,2015,05,26
204,50th birthday getaway weekend,"A surprise 50th birthday escape for my wife and I, was made absolutely brilliant by the hotel and staff that is the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin.A central location in the heart of Dublins many great attractions this 5 star hotel cannot be faulted and is a must stay place for any visit you make to the emerald Isle.",5,2015,05,26
204,Comfortably friendly luxury,"I can't say enough about the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff here. Made us feel like visiting friends, not ""just"" customers. Rooms aren't huge by any means, but comparable to any city hotel (bigger than most in NYC for sure!). Nice touches, like truffles at nighttime turndown and free bottled water, made our stay even nicer. Loved the included breakfast.",5,2015,05,26
204,Excellent location good service,"Fitzwilliam hotel is very central and located beside the main shopping street Grafton St
Rooms are ver spacious and the 6 th floor ones overlooking St Stephens are excellent.
Top standard hotel and high season can be quiet pricy.Bar is basic and lobby small good for a couple nights stay ,breakfast very good and healthy",5,2015,05,26
204,Lovely Hotel in centre of City,"Had a lovely stay in Fitzwilliam Hotel. Staff were top class right and most helpful from minute we arrived to we checked out. They were also able to accommodate us checking in early. Our room was located on the 6th floor and although it was quite a small room it was big enough to move about. Bed was very comfortable but I felt the room was a little rough around the edges for a 5* Hotel. Curtains did not close properly - I notice another visitor had also made this remark in their review. Breakfast was beautiful and good variety of fresh products to choose from as well as option of a fresh cooked breakfast, but the table we were gave was badly stained with tea and coffee - not something I would expect from a 5* hotel. Overall a nice hotel in great location with exceptional staff.",4,2015,05,26
204,"Great city location, helpful service","We stayed here recently on a Friday night.  The hotel is modern and perfectly located on St. Stephen's Green with restaurants, shopping and good bars closeby.
We arrived and availed of the valet parking which was great.  Our room was bright,  absolutely clean and comfortable.
The staff were very helpful on check-in and on departure, in fact we were allowed to leave our suitcases and car for a few hours after check-out before we were ready to leave Dublin in the afternoon which was a very nice touch.
Breakfast was great, a lovely selection in the cold buffet and hot breakfast was cooked to order which we sampled all and were certainly set for the day!
I would certainly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel to others and would stay there again.",5,2015,05,25
204,"Defined by ""Location, Location, Location!"" with wonderful energy","If any hotel can be defined by its Location, its this hotel.  Bang opposite Stephens Greens and at the start point of Grafton Street,, you can't ask anything more on Location.

As soon as you enter the hotel you are hit by the inimitable energy and enthusiasm of the Irish.  Their positive attitude towards life on a day to day basis is contagious.

The check in becomes pleasant with energy lifting conversations and your travel fatigues are quickly lost.

The rooms are clean and beautiful.  

The room service is quick and breakfast is wonderful.

The Donahuges Pub is just a 10 minute walk. the Temple Bar district is 10 minute by taxi.

The staff is very helpful and the concierge is very knowledgable.  

Lovely place will choose no other hotel when I visit Dublin again in August this year.

The only sad point is there are no Smoking Rooms or Balcony......",4,2015,05,24
204,Fantastic First Class & Prime Location,"From the moment we arrived at the Airport in Dublin we were collected by taxi arranged by the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Once arrived greeted by Concierge who took our bags to our room. The room was bright & comfortable with a great view of St Stephens Park. 
Waiter brought us cocktails to the room. Reception booked us taxis, Restaurants & shows without any delay. Walking distance to the famous shopping Grafton Street infact just outside the hotel and turn left! It was everything and more We loved our stay here and wouldnt go anywhere else! Thank you Fitzwilliam",5,2015,05,24
204,Excellent Visit,"Arrived early in the morning and the room was not quite ready, they did however have a day room that provided a shower and the ability to freshen up. They also helped set up a Whiskey tasting experience at their bar which was excellent and given by Michael it was a new venture that they set up just for us. The staff was very pleasant. We had a wonderful stay and hope to be back in the future.",5,2015,05,24
204,Excellent hotel,Only stayed here for a night but wish it was for longer! Our room got upgraded because our room wasn't ready yet which was fantastic as the room was the best I've ever stayed in! The receptionist brought us up to the room to show us everything there which was really kind of her. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly our whole time there and with a view over St. Stephens Green it was a day well spent! Would definitely come back again!,5,2015,05,24
204,"Good location, friendly and professional","Stayed 1 night arrived very late, up early, had a fabulous breakfast. Staff extremely efficient and courteous without over familiarity, all of which you would expect from a hotel such as this, all in all a great stay. Bedroom comfortable and not overly stuffy, my car was taken and returned efficiently. Good value for prime location.",5,2015,05,23
204,"Good location, nice staff and good service","The hotel is located very close to the shopping mall and shopping street (Grafton street), it has St stepehens garden in front of it and a railway station too. The location is very good, nature lovers will like it due to the proximity to the garden. The shopping mall is very close by and there are restaurants adjacent to the hotel as well (apart from the in house ones)

The staff are very friendly and provide a good service. Even though I dont know much about other hotels in this area, but this hotel is worth visiting once. One different thing I noticed is that they provide chocolates everyday when they clean up the room :)",4,2015,05,21
204,"Lovely welcome, lovely room,really comfortable bed!",Booked as a treat for my birthday. Didn't have the breakfast as with all Dublin hotels too expensive. Staff were lovely had lovely garden view room. Very quiet & great having everything on the doorstep.,5,2015,05,16
204,"Good hotel - great restaurant, but rooms could be better","Stayed here for a couple of nights on business. The concierge staff were very welcoming and helpful. We ate in the hotel bar for the first night. The food was just average. I had fish and chips which were very greasy. I was in a room on the 6th floor which was  little noisy owing to some sort of machinery. The room itself was little worn. For example the curtains didn't close together, the blinds didn't go fully down. A tad disappointing for a 5* on the Green Hotel. On a brighter note, the breakfast was superb and one of the best breakfast meals I have ever had in a hotel. Would consider going back",4,2015,05,15
204,"Not cheap, but good","Good value for money - decent size rooms, clean, with good beds and en-suite audio system that makes a difference in the morning. Good breakfast, too, with plenty of choice above the crap standard brekkie. Even gluten-free options are available. Staff are polite and very helpful. My only negative comment is about how thin the walls are - I was able to hear literary everything that was happening in all rooms around me, including toilet activities. Surprising for the hotel of such standard. Still, hard to find something better in central Dublin, I think.",4,2015,05,15
204,Excellent hotel!,This hotel was very nice.  We stayed here two nights...the beginning of our trip and the last night of our trip.  They are extremely friendly and helpful.  The room was beautiful!!! Beds super comfy and centrally located.  We arrived early and they let us keep our bags there and even delivered them to our room when it was ready.,5,2015,05,13
204,It really Fitz!!!,"Really nice hotel and ideally located! We staid there 3 nights, the staff was really nice and helpful, they gave us nice advice, the room was perfect (they could add Apple compatible music devices though). Last but not least, Thornton's was delicious, the waiters were great, it really deserves its Michelin star!",5,2015,05,12
204,Anniversary celebration,"Fitzwilliam hotel was a memorable way to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. I had booked the hotel the day before , with a seamless booking by phone, and really went above and beyond to accomodate the occassion. 

Check in was a pleasure, we left the desk feeling very special indeed. The room was amazing and we were greeted with some special greetings and chocs. 

Our overnight stay was rounded of with a late check out, and a newspaper for our short journey home, we would recomend the hotel to anyone looking for  special stay.",5,2015,05,11
204,Leisure break in the centre of Dublin,"Myself and my wife wanted to go to Dublin for a break. We have stayed in Dublin many times and like the city. The one thing we did not want, was to worry about taxi's and we did not want to take a chance on our room. After a lot of searching on-line I was fortunate to get The Fitzwilliam Hotel. The parking was very convenient (we literally parked under the hotel!). We were met by a member of staff and he very kindly took our bags to the reception. The service was immaculate like the hotel. The room was exactly the same as pictured on the website and as for location; we were able to walk everywhere...at our own pace. If you can, stay here for a true Dublin experience. Location, location, location  ",5,2015,05,11
204,"Great location, fabulous room & exceptional service","We stayed here last night & the service was exceptional from start to finish. On arriving, the doorman took care of our car parking and the check-in was prompt & professional. The room itself was beautifully decorated (albeit not as modern as the Fitzwilliam in Belfast) and whilst it was on the small side it was perfectly designed. Location was perfect. The hotel was happy to facilitate a late check-out free of charge and check-out was as efficient & professional as check-in. Room service was the fastest we have experienced in any hotel. We will definitely be returning.",5,2015,05,10
204,Fantastic,"My husband and I celebrated our Wedding Anniversary with an overnight stay here on Saturday. From the moment we entered the car park we were greeted with a smile and a welcome from every member of staff we met.
Our 5th floor balcony overlooked St. Stephen's Green and the room itself was stunning.
We enjoyed a relaxing drink in the bar downstairs and my breakfast the following morning of Pancakes and fresh fruit was delicious.
We enjoyed a most memorable visit and will hopefully return some day.",5,2015,05,10
204,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed here on the last night of a week long girls trip.  Staff was exceptional and professional.  Room was clean, neat and well appointed. Location is perfect for exploring and hitting up Grafton Street.  Will stay here next time I am in Dublin!",5,2015,05,10
204,"Disappointed in this ""5 star"" hotel","On arrival, no porters in sight, taxi driver had to carry our luggage into reception and still no-one to assist. The ""Signature"" twin rooms in this hotel are so small you cannot walk past each other without one person stepping aside. The wi-fi is very poor and the connection keeps dropping. You can hear every single word being said in the passage outside your door, and when the shower or bath in the room above you or beside you is being used it sounds as if the water is coming from your own bathroom. I got up twice to check that it was not a burst water pipe in our bathroom, it was extremely noisy and loud. The beds were very comfortable and the location absolutely perfect, but we won't go back to this hotel - attention to detail is needed.",3,2015,05,10
204,Not quite 5 star hotel,"We had a Premium Delux double room on the 5th floor. However, the room was not what we had expected in a 5 star hotel. The room was small and cramped, the double bed had stupid poles on each end that we stumbled into going to the bathroom. We had a private terrasse but entering the terrasse was through the window! The location was excellent with a nice view to the Green Park. Service was very good. Breakfast ok.",3,2015,05,06
204,5 star staff 4 star Hotel,"We arrived late in the evening. Our 'superior' room was small, with a grubby carpet, mismatched furniture, water marks on the furniture, a cracked sink and a plug that would not raise.

The following morning we checked that we'd been allocated the right class of room at the desk and were assured that it was. However, moments after we got back to our room the phone rang and the guy at the desk offered a different room of the same class. The new room was a bit larger - enough to make it comfortable and the plug worked! The other issues were much the same as the first room.
Full marks for moving us to a better room so quickly and without us needing to ask (it pays to be polite).

The breakfast was a pretty standard breakfast buffet, nothing special, although the poached eggs from the menu were pretty good. The problem was that the space the breakfast is served in is far too small for the hotel when it's busy. This resulted in the staff rushing to clear tables at the expense of service to the seated customers and at times a queue built up at the restaurant entrance.

It's also worth noting that there's a nightclub adjacent  to the hotel. We could just hear it from our room one night, but I'd imagine the noise could be an issue in some rooms close to the front of the building.

Just to be clear, ALL the staff were always very friendly and could not do enough to help - but the hotel building and facilities were a disappointment.",3,2015,05,06
204,Great Location,"We go to Dublin a lot and have stayed in many hotels but booked this one last minute for the location.

It really is in a great location for shopping and restaurants, st stephens green etc. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the valet parking is great. 

The lobby is nice and modern with a good seating area. We had a drink in the hotel bar which was great but its not the nicest hotel bar in Dublin. Our room was on the small side and it really was in need of some maintenance. But the bed was very comfy and it was quiet. 

Breakfast was great, so many options so would definitely recommend it. 

All in all it just wasn't 5 star standard compared to other Dublin hotels such as the Marker or the Dylan. But we still had a great stay.",3,2015,05,05
204,Location and service 5* hotel overall not quite 5*,"The Fitzwilliam is in an excellent location on St Stephen's Green, close to Grafton Street and within walking distance of lots of attractions and restaurants. The staff of the hotel are an asset. Without exception we found them helpful and courteous. Unfortunately one or two things let the hotel down when compared to other 5* hotels we have stayed in. Furnishings could be refreshed especially carpets and the bathrooms need some attention. Towels could do with a dose of fabric conditioner - they were rather hard, not fluffy.  Breakfast service is rather chaotic although the excellent staff do their best. Mineral water in the mini bar is complimentary - a nice touch, but on our first night we had to call for some as the minibar had not been re-stocked. We did not eat in the hotel in the evening but the bar was pleasant enough and prices very reasonable.",4,2015,05,05
204,4 days in Dublin,"We stayed in this hotel and the best of it was its location. It was in front of St. Stephens Garden and a minute from Grafton St. (a great shopping area of Dublin). 
The rooms were nice and the breakfast was excellent. The only thing that was not so good was some noise at night in the corridors that could be heard in the rooms.",4,2015,05,04
204,Wonderful stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for the last 3 nights of our honeymoon trip to Ireland and we had a wonderful stay! We were always greeted by the doormen, and had great experiences with the concierge and hotel staff in general. Our room was quiet (as I had requested - on the inner courtyard, so nice that they were able to accommodate my request!) and a lovely size. The bathroom was also very nice, great shower pressure and nice amenities. The location can't be beat - we walked almost everywhere and were able to catch the Hop On Hop Off bus right around the corner. We played the Portmarnock golf course and the hotel arranged us a great transfer to and from the course. We absolutely loved Dublin and our stay at the Fitzwilliam was a perfect end to our trip! We wish we never had to leave!",5,2015,05,04
204,Great overnight stay with breakfast service as highlight.,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel on an overnight before a business meeting.  Check-in was smooth with my bags picked up straight away coming out of the taxi and swift check-in. All of the staff I dealt with were friendly in a sincere way, not the exaggerated kind you get sometimes.  They all looked as if they really enjoyed their work, even the junior staff and believe me, that's where you will notice how a hotel treats their staff.

The room itself was nice and clean and had a great shower in the bathroom.  Easy to do some work in except for the flaky WiFi as detailed below (that's the room, not the shower...).  The highlight was definitely the breakfast.  A warm welcome, great choice of foods and superb service by the staff.  I'd return just for that alone, as it sets up your day.

Overall positives and points for improvement:
+
*good working desk
*comfortable reading sofa
*great shower
*breakfast choice and service
*friendly staff all around
*power points close enough to the bed to plug in phone overnight
*effective, quiet air-con

- (all minor except the first one)
*WiFi in the room was not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. It would show a good connection, however after some time (10-15 minutes) would go slow and I'd have to reconnect for another period of decent speed.  I was on other WiFi networks throughout the day with the same computer, so not down to that.  
*No power point close to the wardrobe.  This contains the ironing board, so you have to awkwardly take the ironing board all the way to the other side of the bed for ironing.
*Entry hall coming into the hotel is a bit weird, with concierge/bag hold in the way between entry, reception and lifts
*Light switches in the room slightly confusing with one apparently doing nothing
*Stereo system in the room was ok, with cd's available from reception, but these days need Bluetooth to stand out
*Not really a point of improvement, more of a fun quirk, but the taps in the bathroom turn counterintuitively to the left to open.",4,2015,05,01
204,Very nice boutique hotel on St. Stephen's Green,"Came for just one night, on a business trip.  The Fitzwilliam is a very pleasant, professional hotel, in an unbeatable location.  I loved that you can walk out, turn left or right, and be in the heart of shopping, pubs, and restaurants.  

Excellent check-in service, with very friendly staff.  

I also went on a morning run, past St. Stephens Green and Merrion Square, to the path along the Grand Canal.  Great 4.5 mile out-and-back.",5,2015,04,26
204,Every aspect of this hotel was superb!,"Beyond the warm welcome at the door by each doorman, the concierge (Patrick) was truly the most engaging, caring and knowledgeable service provider I have ever met in a hotel in my global travels.  Joorka and Josefina were exemplary as service providers also.  If you want to tour the city, ask for Eddie (the hotel's recommended, very reliable driver).  He provided wonderful stories about Dublin en route to our entertaining meal at Johnnie Fox's.  A must-do restaurant experience!  Great value for the price also and the hotel is centrally located to lots of fun bars and restaurants.  I was sad to leave!  

Thanks, Fitzwilliam Team.  I will return again!
Leslie",5,2015,04,23
204,"Great location, tired room decor","I had high hopes for this hotel. Was listed as one of the trendier hotels. You cant beat the location in central Dublin. Walking distance to pubs, restaurants and shopping. Overall, the food was excellent and two good choices for lunch and dinner on premises. I only had breakfast and lunch. Lobby was nice and inviting however my room suite was draped in dark carpet and an overall dark atmosphere with poor lighting. It was in some bad need of updating in terms of furniture and carpets. Clean room, no issues there but a serious buzz kill and ask for their reco for a local Gym if you want to work out. Both Concierges were fantastic though! Incredibly helpful and attentive.",3,2015,04,23
204,Great hotel in an excellent location,"Excellent location, right in the city centre within walking distance from the main sights. The rooms are much nicer than the reception which is a bit gloomy....but you won't be in reception for long. The breakfast was good and there was a good choice. It's cheaper to book the breakfast the nice before rather than just turning up.",5,2015,04,23
204,Good central location,"Stayed at this hotel for a few days last week.  On the plus side the location is perfect but I certainly wouldn't call it a five star hotel.  Our room was fairly small with a view of an office block.  For the price we paid I would have thought breakfast would have been included as it always had been in any hotel we have stayed in Ireland.  The staff weren't overly friendly except for the nice young bar man.  Will I stay there again, probably not.",4,2015,04,23
204,"Great hotel, excellent location! ","Had a great stay at this hotel! Staff were very helpful and gave us excellent service. Loved the room decor, very clean and modern. Hotel is in a perfect location, right beside Grafton street and St Stephens Green. We will definitely stay at this hotel again! ",5,2015,04,19
204,Weekend break,"Very central, convenient and well-equipped comfortable room. However I feel it is more 4* than 5* due to the atmosphere and while the staff are attentive other hotels in dublin frankly offer a sharper more attentive service. ",4,2015,04,19
204,Excellent location and attentive staff,"This hotel is in the center of Dublin, a block from Grafton Street and directly across the street from St. Stephens Green. City attractions are within walking distance. While in Dublin consider day trips to Howth fishing village, Malahide Castle and Kilkenny. Book your train tickets online and get a 10-15% discount (and to make sure the train to Kilkenny isn't sold out).  And make certain to enjoy a Guinness or two at any of the many Dublin pubs. The hotel is nicely appointed but the rooms are a bit small. And I was surprised that you could only get breakfast in the hotel if you ordered room service!  However the bar area was nice (though the menu is somewhat limited) and the staff was exceptionally attentive (particularly the concierge and maid staff). I would stay here again. ",4,2015,04,16
204,Irish charm at the Fitzwilliam,"We had 2 ooms at the hotel both overlooked the Courtyard which was v quiet. At around 6pm on both eveninga a noisy drilling started up but stopped later in the evening.
The rooms are v warm so needed to use the air con but that is noisy of course.
Lovely toiletries complimentary of course, bathrobe and slippers and chocolates and a turn down service were lovely touches. 
My only grouch is the fact that only the suites and higher priced rooms have a walk in shower. It's aways a big step down out of the bath which is not good for the average 80 year old. I did know bout this and chose the hotel mainly due the location and the fact that we paid for an Easter Break  which was a good offer. 
Valet parking is only €10 a night.  
Breakfast was nice but the full Irish is pre cooked and kept warm so a Little dry. The staff are all v nice and helpful without being pretentious-  beds were comfy and the overall stay was lovely. 
I would stay here again as the other comparative hotels in the area are not located opposite St Stephens Green  Well The Shelbourne is but that's much more expensive !!",4,2015,04,14
204,Excellent location and informative staff,"The location is key for this hotel, right on St. Stephens green. The concierge is incredibly knowledgable and helpful. We didn't get to try the delicious restaurant since we were with the kids, but the menu is drool worthy. I would have given 5 stars except that we were placed on the 6th floor which doesn't have elevator access. This was a schlep multiple times daily with our stroller. I wish someone had forewarned us so that we could have requested a lower floor. When I mentioned the inconvenience to a staff member I was told it was because I had a suite. If there really are no suites on lower floors, then I actually would have taken a regular room to avoid the issue. Regardless, its a very nice hotel and the room was lovely and the price is definitely right.",4,2015,04,12
204,Great Location,"This was a last minute break, the Hotel is ideally located for shopping and sightseeing ,the rooms well furnished but the room we were allocated was facing an inner court yard and our view was lifeless and you felt as if you were being watched as the Hotel was built around this inner court yard. The most disappointing feature of this Hotel is its Breakfast , I ordered Eggs Benedict and my Husband Full Irish when served they were so dry it was obvious they had been left to stand under the heater lights it was so bad that we didn't bother having Breakfast on our second morning .

Would i visit again NO I'm sure there are nicer Hotels in Dublin",3,2015,04,11
204,"Great location, Fabulous Staff",Spent a week in Ireland using the Fitzwilliam as home base. The hotel staff are great - very helpful and friendly. Will definitely come back when I am in Dublin. Very quiet room with courtyard view. Very close to most things ,5,2015,04,10
204,excellent hospitality,"Coming from the US, the flights always seem to land at a most inconvenient time to check in at a hotel and coming off a red eye, all you want to do is rest.The staff at the Fitzwilliam were so accommodating. The rooms were quite large and clean. I must say the beds were the most comfortable of all the hotels we stayed at in Ireland. Great Location too!",5,2015,04,10
204,"Great location, nice room, shame about the breakfast","My girlfriend and I stayed for one night at the Fitzwilliam hotel in March, as I was sitting an exam the next morning. The location is excellent, as it was right next door to the exam hall. We were greeted with a friendly welcome on arrival, and the checking-in process was swift and hasslefree. The room itself was nice, although quite small for the price. The bed had clean linen, and the view was fantastic. However, the bath and sink had obvious limescale marks, and the tiling around the bath and shower had clearly seen better days. The furniture in the room, especially the wardrobe, looked particularly dated and had numerous deep scratches in the woodwork. We had paid for breakfast the next morning. We arrived promptly at 07:10 and were shown to our table. There was no obvious vegetarian option, so I requested a meat-free version of the full english. The breakfast consisted of scrabbled eggs, toast, sauteed potatoes, mushrooms and grilled tomatoes. However, the scrabbled eggs had no herbs/chives and no seasoning whatsoever, and neither did the sauteed potatoes. In addition, the mushrooms tasted out-of-date, and also lacked any seasoning. Considering the price of the breakfast, and the fact that it was pointed out to us that the hotel has a michellin-starred restaurant, I was really quite surprised at how poor the breakfast was. Overall, I was quite disappointed, and feel that the value for money at this hotel was particularly poor.",3,2015,04,09
204,Lovely hotel with exemplary servic,Stayed one night at the Fitzwilliam - a lovely hotel - stylish well appointed rooms with really comfortable beds - great location and exemplary service from staff. Wish we had been able to stay longer and will definitely visit gain. Thankyou for looking after a pair of weary jet lagged travellers on a freezing night.,5,2015,04,08
204,Excellent find in Dublin!,"We loved the location, atmosphere, and style of the hotel. From the moment we arrived all the staff we dealt with were lovely and helpful. 

The rooms are well appointed, very nicely decorated, and comfortable. The only thing I'd improve about the decor/furnishing would be the bedding, but it certainly wasn't uncomfortable or cheap; I'm just a fan of fine linen. I also loved the purple, green, and gold colour scheme in the room and  the wooden trim and furnishing. 
We stayed at the hotel to see if would be a good option for our wedding hotel. The staff were helpful in showing us the different room options and all the different types of rooms we saw were lovely. We are definitely thinking of using the Fitzwilliam as our hotel for the bridal party and wedding night. 
Really great stay. ",5,2015,04,08
204,Great base in The city,"This hotel has a great location on St Stephens Green. You can easily walk to all the main attractions. The rooms are on the small side but functional. They have a contemporary feel.  A nice touch is the seating by the picture window . Beds are comfortable, plenty of storage and a very good over bath shower. Nice toiletries too. Our room was on level 3 and we found it very quiet even at Easter weekend. The staff we encountered were all extremely courteous and helpful.
I would definitely stay again if I return to Dublin",5,2015,04,06
204,Nice hotel but missing atmosphere,"From our booking over the phone to the check in the staff couldn't of being more helpful and friendly however this hotel is missing atmosphere and attention to detail, for a 5star a lot needs to improve, the lobby is void of personality and mood, we sat at the fire at 9.45pm one Eve and the cleaning lady was zooming around with the hover!! Rooms are very humid, if this was a 4 star I would of being happy but not impressed but as a 5 star I'm disappointed!! Staff are super but it ends there!",3,2015,04,06
204,Lovely hotel and great location,"Arrived in a taxi from Dublin Airport which took about 25 minutes. Great location, on the St Stephens Green. 

The hotel is rather discreet however a lovely entrance and welcome, quickly i was checked in and my room located on 4th floor. The room was lovely and was luxuriously comfortable.  The view out the window into an office wasn't but this did in no way spoil my experience.

We hosted a meal at Shanahans which is a fine steak restaurant and this was less than a minutes walk.  All shops and tours of Dublin started nearby.

I will stay here when I return to Dublin.",4,2015,04,06
204,Amazing ,"What can I say only amazing from the moment you walk in the door . Got upgrade to room over looking Stephens green fab . Didn't want to leave the room , lovely chocolates a little bag off Easter eggs such a lovely treat , normally stay at the westbury but think Ill be moving . Staff so helpful and friendly a truly amazing stay .
will definitely be back 😃
Can't fault a thing some lovely touches . 
Well done to all . ",5,2015,04,05
204,I'm jealous of your Upcoming stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel!,"I chose the Fitzwilliam because of its location, across the street from St. Stephen's Green, and a short walk to everything else in Dublin. It lived up to its Rating! The very friendly staff, especially Phillip in Concierge, gave us excellent advice and directions for seeing Dublin. Large room, comfortable bed, and a wonderful bathroom made our first night in Ireland perfect! We even had a small balcony overlooking St. Stephen's. Stay at the Fitzwilliam as long as you can!",5,2015,04,02
204,birthday treat,stayed at this hotel for 1 night in March and i must say we were impressed from the moment we arrived until we left. The service we received by the staff was excellent very friendly and helpful and the hotel decor and faciilities were excellent. The location was superb for all the attractions and shops and a short walk to the temple bar region. I would definatley recomend astay at this beautiful hotel,5,2015,04,01
204,Close to the heart of Dublin,Great location and quiet . The only drawback was parking and cost of parking . However thats city living and life . There are loads of shops and restaurants nearby and coffee shops. The canal is a short walk from here as is Stevens green and shopping center an easy walk . We spent a week end here then went to Co.Mayo to visit family . We landed in Dublin airport and we had to wait til the following day to hear a local accent that belonged to the tour bus driver . Just a sign of the times and a more open Europe.,4,2015,03,30
204,Oops,Mains served before starters! White wine served when red had been ordered and a hair decorating my desert!! Not quite what I expected however staff tried their utmost to minimise the impact on whAt should have been a lovely Mothers day meal !,4,2015,03,28
204,Awful customer service,"Stayed at this hotel before and liked it as it is close to my office and I travel for work - however this time when I checked out and was heading to airport I noticed a no-show charge when I inquired what this was for I was told that I was originally booked to show on Monday - I confirmed with them that was incorrect and regardless of who I spoke with I was told they were ""sorry"" but there was nothing they could do as that's what their system had recorded.  Needless to say I'm now stuck with the charge and I'm frustrated that no one told me when I checked in that I would be charged for an extra night when I could have contacted my corp travel office but instead it just appeared on my bill with no explanation and I'm stuck with the expense - needless to say that on my next business trip to Ireland I'll stay at the Weston which is the preferred hotel for my company, I guess I know why now...",1,2015,03,27
204,Wonderful hotel,"We recently stayed at this hotel at the recommendation of a relative and were extremely pleased. The location was fantastic, the breakfast was wonderful and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Every detail was perfect and I have no doubt that if there had been any issue that the staff would have taken care of it immediately with a smile. I would recommend this hotel without reservation to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,03,26
204,great find in the city center,"The Fitzwilliam was a first class experience from the moment we arrived.  The staff are universally helpful and friendly and the location cannot be beat.  We needed to adjust our reservation on arrival, and this was handled in an efficient, friendly manner with no mix ups.  Also, Phil at the front desk escorted us to our room, offering helpful advice on the amenities and the local area.  The concierge was also excellent and very pleasant.  My friend left her glasses in the car that was valet parked, and he cheerfully and quickly retrieved them for us, as well as offering to go back to retrieve an ipod that had also accidentally been left in the car.
The casual dining restaurant at the hotel has excellent food (we did not try the fancy restaurant), and the breakfast buffet had many options.
The room was comfortable with lots of storage, great beds, stereo, nice bath.  
But the best thing about the hotel is the location.  Right across from St Stephen's green, at the top of Grafton Street for great shopping, people watching, and many dining options, and walking distance from Trinity and many tourist sites.  
I will try to stay here whenever I visit Dublin!",5,2015,03,25
204,Dublin for beginners,Perfect place to start your discovery of Dublin.  Just at the edge of St. Stephen's Green and the top of Grafton street for a great shopping experience.  Within easy reach of the upper market end of town for bars and restaurants.  The Fitzwilliam has friendly professional staff. The longue area and bar are ideal for winding down after a long day.  Rooms are well equipped and spacious.  Very reasonably priced hotel for the location.  Also quiet and clean. Fluffy towel rating = 8.  I stay here every time I visit Dublin.,5,2015,03,25
204,"Chic, Cozy and Classic. Best Hotel in Dublin!","Flew into Dublin on a red-eye and failed to book a room the night before.  Arrived at the Fitzwiliam at an ungodly hour only to be met by the most welcoming and efficient Joanna from Poland. 

Eclectic.  Warm.  Cozy.  Buzzy.  Not a guest in site (note ungodly hour).  And miss Joanna received my annoying earliness like a champ.  After chatting about the high Tatras, her boyfriend, and Poland she sent me up to Citron (their restaurant) for breakfast (comped) while I waited for my room.

Greeted by Lucian, a charming and attentive young man from Romania, I felt right at home.  He made me a delectable cappuccino, talked to me for a bit and kept trying to feed me more.  Hi hello, the BEST.  My jetlag hangover was quickly subsiding.

Not long after I arrived, my room was ready  (I kiss the ground Joanna walks on). The room dons rich purples and greens.  Very Scandinavian (upscale Ikea). Nestled up against a very random garden set in between the hotel and an office building.  Note: office building cannot see into the hotel. Magic curved glass apparently has a super power that keeps peepers from peeping. 

Bathroom is beautiful.   My room was perfect. 

My stay there was epic overall. Patrick, one of several amazing members of the concierge staff was also rad. Josefina, another front desk gal was fantastic as well! Actually – the ENTIRE staff was rad.  

The Fitzwilliam in Dublin exceeded my expectations.  Not at all off the beaten path, but feels like you are and I love the international feel of the hotel.  I felt like I was at a Kimpton property - my favorite of all.  I really can’t recommend this hotel enough!",5,2015,03,22
204,Great Location,"The Fitzwilliam is in a great location on St. Stephen's Green and at the end of Grafton Street, within walking distance of all major attractions and museums yet far enough away from Temple Bar so as not to be bothered by its noise.  Although the rooms are a bit small, they are modern, very clean and generally comfortable.  Do take advantage of one of the best restaurants in Dublin, Thornton's, in the hotel.",4,2015,03,18
204,It doesn't get any better!,"I absolutely loved this Hotel. The decor, room, location, restuarant, service, staff and little touches throughout my stay, made for a perfect way to enjoy the best of Dublins city area. If you want to treat yourself or a loved one then don't hesitate in staying here.",5,2015,03,18
204,Great for business and pleasure,"Stayed here a week for business and found the amenities quite good: rooms were clean and spacious, free wifi, laundry  service quite efficient and very helpful and pleasant staff. The conference room was adequate. Breakfast had a good variety of hot and cold choices. And the best part of this hotel is its location. Right in the center of the city where you can walk to anywhere!",4,2015,03,18
204,"Excellent hotel, good service, good location","Really beautiful rooms, large bathrooms, great quality sleep. Excellent customer service. Very good location, close to a park as well as shopping. Breakfast could use an upgrade - hot part of the breakfast is upon request/order and therefore not idea if you are in a hurry. In general not the best buffet I've even seen. Other than that, I definitely recommend.",4,2015,03,17
204,A great weekend treat,"A lovely hotel in a lovely location opposite St Stephens , great service, lovely room. Knowledgeable concierge helped make for a great weekend. The bar was great giving options  of lively or quiet sections. The restaurant was excellent - well worth a treat!!",5,2015,03,17
204,Great location and gorgeous rooms!,"Loved my stay at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin! It's right across the street from St. Stephen's Green and walking distance to pretty much everywhere on the south side. Tons of restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, etc. - truly everything you need is right there. The rooms are gorgeous with plenty of room - the only ""complaint"" is that that like many hotels in Europe no plug for hair dryer in the bathroom, so had to find a plug behind the bedside table to use to dry my hair. But that's a minor inconvenience... in fact, might be better because then bathroom doesn't get stifling hot after showering, etc. Onsite restaurant was very good - quick service, great food. Would definitely stay here again anytime and wish I had stayed at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast as well during my stay.",5,2015,03,16
204,Amazing!,"The best hotel me and my sister could hope to stay in on our holiday treat!
The breakfast was delicious and the staff was extremely friendly... felt like I always been there even if was our first time...
Hope to come back 1 day... Love it xxx",5,2015,03,14
204,"Great location, comfortable beds and fantastic concierge","I have stayed here before several times and it is consistently good. The rooms are comfortable and nicely furnished. However, on this occasion I had a very small shower room, rather than a bath with shower, it would have been nice to be given the option upon check in. Another small point was a waitress at breakfast whipping away some cutlery on the table for another guest, without asking; and so I had to say that I was waiting for a colleague rather than being asked first.
Very small points that stopped this trip from being otherwise perfect.
The concierge who has been there on prior visits is really helpful.",4,2015,03,14
204,Nice room.,"That was very nice to be there once. The hotel is very good and it is in the nice area. I recommend the place for your relaxing time. Also you can go to everywhere in the city. Enjoy the Dublin night, there are a big variety of pubs, restaurants around that hotel.",4,2015,03,09
204,Smart modern hotel. Very comfortable,"This hotel is very modern and comfortable. The rooms are quiet and comfortable with a lovely bed, but a little on the small side. Beautiful bathroom too. Great cosy bar just off reception and super friendly helpful staff. Highly recommended. ",4,2015,03,08
204,Fabulous as ever,"I recently stayed twice at this wonderful hotel. From the welcoming reception, to the efficient staff, to the perfect room. The location is perfect for all needs. This is definitely my go to hotel in Dublin and I hope to be back many more times. 
My only complaint is the noise. It is always a noisy experience staying in the fitzwilliam and sleep quality is poor. Given its location I understand. ",5,2015,03,08
204,fantastic hotel and service,"stayed 2 nights, have stayed in other hotels in Dublin but chose this for its location to what I needed to do and what a great choice it was.
Met by Tony the concierge great guy just like the rest, then by Josefina at reception really was a warm welcome.
the room, 308 was first class the service is truly five star and the food here as well.
Will most definitely stay there on my return, plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. great place, you will not be disappointed",5,2015,03,06
204,First class hotel,"Stayed three nights Excellent hotel. Very central location. Shops are within walking distance.
Opposite St Stephen,s Green and tram line.which makes it easy to travel around the city.
Staff and food was 5star. Would stay there again.",4,2015,03,05
204,Fabulous ,"I stayed here on a Saturday night, I have to say everything from arrival to departure was top class. The room was very cosy not over big but I had no problem with that, the bed was very comfortable and that's all that mattered. Breakfast was top class nothing was a problem for the waiters/ waitresses, they were very helpful and friendly. I will be back again next time I'm in Dublin for a weekend. Location is perfect for luas and shopping in Grafton street. Well done to everyone involved in this beautiful 5 star hotel. This hotel would leave any other 5 star in the area sitting. ",5,2015,03,04
204,Dreamed a dream by the old canal,"Lived/worked in Dub for a few years but recently went back for a weekend for the Rugby and stayed at the Fitz. Centrally located by St Stephans Green so easy to find and get around Dublin from a great central location. Good hotel, nice rooms, good food and very helpful staff. Plenty of bars restaurants within easy walking distance wether you head into town or anywhere off the square. Right on the end of Grafton Street if you want the shopping.",4,2015,03,03
204,Dublin,"Stayed for one night because we were going to a concert.  It was a lovely hotel the room was lovely with view of Stephens green extremely comfortable bed and pillows, room was nice and warm.  Staff were very helpful.  The breakfast was excellent with a menu for the hot choice of breakfast.  I enjoyed this hotel very Central would stay again.",4,2015,03,02
204,"Best Hotel in the World, probably","The Fitzwilliam is a little gem in the heart of Dublin. A 5 star hotel that feels like a family run establishment. Whether you are there on business or for leisure you will be welcomed and made to feel at home. Every staff member has a 'nothing is too much trouble' attitude which in my opinion is hard to find but a joy to be on the receiving end of. The beds are amazingly comfortable, the food fabulous and they serve a delightful elder-flower martini. What more could you want?",5,2015,02,27
204,Excellent stay in Dublin,"Wonderful hotel with very comfortable beds, great service and perfect location. The concierge set us up with a driver one day so we could tour the midlands. His name was Eddie McBride-he was fantastic. Highly recommend this hotel and Eddie!",5,2015,02,25
204,"Outstanding service, right in the heart of town","I had an outstanding stay at the FiztWilliam this summer and just remembered I didn't do a review. Well, it was truly an outstanding visit. As usual, I worked the concierge staff to the bone. I had them arrange two different tours for me, including the Wild Wicklaw Tour and another one for several days around the country. They were simply outstanding, outstanding, outstanding!!!
The hotel itself and the room in particular were very comfortable and convenient. The location is hard to beat, being on St. Stephen's Green and literally out the door to outstanding shopping and down the road from so many historic sites including Trinity College.
I had a really lovely, relaxing time, and if I go back to Dublin soon, I'll be sure to stay at the FitzWilliam again!",5,2015,02,18
204,Central location,Fitzwilliam is a clean and convenient hotel near Grafton Street. Staff is super friendly and provide good advice on things to do. The breakfast is very good and you can either eat and run or linger over your coffee.,4,2015,02,17
204,"Luxury rooms, very quiet and comfortable","This hotel lives up to expectation, the beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms a good size. The service is very good and attentive, check in/out rarely took more than 2 minutes.

The location is right in the heart of Dublin, and St Stephens Green is lovely to walk around.

The breakfast is very good. The selection of restaurants and bars are very good too ranging from normal hotel food to the Michelin star in house restaurant.

Note the Wifi is not the strongest, so I would recommend staying in a room near the lifts if this is important. You can get a signal all around the hotel, but it is slower the further from the lifts that you stay.",5,2015,02,16
204,Boutique Style in central location,"Hotel is on top of St Stephens Green, which means you can reach all central attractions easily. Rooms modern and clean. I liked the special touches like real flowers in the room. Luxurious shower gels and shampoos. Free morning paper. We had a signature Queen room, which was spacious and had all necessary amenities. Very comfortable bed. Room was facing the courtyard which means it was very quiet at night. I will definitely stay again. Thanks Fitzwilliam, really enjoyed my stay and hoped I would have booked for longer.",5,2015,02,16
204,Great breakfast!,"Arriving on a Friday evening, we were very pleased to both have our car parked for us & get a reservation in the restaurant for dinner. Both staff members with whom we dealt up to this point were friendly & welcoming. Our room was deliciously warm & we were happy with its facilities, the flowers, candles etc.
The waiting staff could perhaps do with a little more training. Despite our reservation for dinner, we were told our greeter would have to speak to the manager before we could be seated. We asked if there was a problem & were assured there wasn't. We never saw him again but a few minutes later, another waiter requested that we sit in some armchairs under the chilly aircon while a table was laid for us. After another few minutes, he returned with some menus saying our table was almost ready. Several minutes later, he returned & brought us to a table that we could quite clearly see from where we had been seated, no staff member had been to while we were waiting. The kitchen may have been under pressure although the restaurant was far from full, perhaps some wait staff hadn't turned up for their shift, I don't know. I do think though, from the hotel's point of view, an opportunity to upsell, an aperitif for example, was lost.
Anyway, we did enjoy our stay but ate off site on our second evening.
On the upside, breakfast was a triumph with the chef displaying an understanding of providing a hard fried egg that seems to defy most! And the tomatoes, wow!",3,2015,02,16
204,"Great location, fantastic service, overpriced","I stayed here for one night on business. It is located in the centre of Dublin on Stephens Green. The staff were exemplary, polite, helpful and very pleasant. The room for the price was a bit small but comfortable, especially the bed. Despite facing Stephens Green it was quiet at night. I ordered breakfast for room service in the morning and I have got to say I was disappointed in the quality of the food. But overall a nice hotel, expensive but you are paying for the location. Would I stay again? Doubtful. I will probably stay in a hotel a bit further out, cheaper, larger rooms",4,2015,02,16
204,"Great for business, super team still doing a great job!","Most recent trip was for three nights. As ever, no complaints and the usual high standards are being maintained. Wifi could be quicker but that really is a minor issue. Room service was a tiny bit of an issue given the price/value ration but once mentioned to the team things were taken care of.",5,2015,02,13
204,Fantastic location.,Stayed here for our wedding anniversary. Hotel is beautiful. Rooms are a little on small side but very comfortable and beautifully appointed. Staff were so helpful and pleasant. Location is second to none. Wld definitely recommend for a night away.,5,2015,02,09
204,Superb location and pleasant hotel,"Upgraded on arrival to room on 5th floor overlooking the green. Comfortable room .. Just slightly small and tiny double bed but all else good. Breakfast was fine .. Not 5 star and portions of bacon, sausage ordered small .. But still nice! Would stay again as location is wonderful and parking a great deal at Euro 10 for 24 hours. Very very pleasant staff ...",4,2015,02,09
204,excellent hotel,"The hotel is very well situated for the park,tram,museums, restaurants , pubs and shopping. The staff were willing to help with a friendly attitude the interior decor was pleasant and the bar areas welcoming.The bedroom was well appointed and the bed comfortable,with breakfast being of a reasonable quality.",5,2015,02,09
204,Couldn't fault it!,"We have just returned from 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, we had a lovely time. The staff were great & very knowledgable, they couldn't do enough for you! Special thanks to Efa for helping us with our reservation.

The rooms were lovely & spotless with all the facilities you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

Lovely breakfast highly recommended 👍",5,2015,02,08
204,Attention to detail from all the staff .,"We were on a short break to Dublin and we really had a wonderful stay, the attention to detail from all the staff,particularly the young lady who served at the bar and also the gentleman at the front. ",5,2015,02,08
204,Not great,Great location. Very helpful staff. Very small rooms. No working taps in bathroom. No hot water. Bar area too small. Windows don't open in bedrooms. Overall very disappointing stay recently. Wouldn't recommend this hotel. Have stayed in several 5 star hotels and most definitely wouldn't class this a 5 star. ,1,2015,02,02
204,"Great location, great staff","If you want a location right in the city centre of Dublin, walking distance to everything, this is a great choice. Merrion, Shelbourne, Westin & Westbury are other 5 star hotels equally well located right in the city. 

You'll get a slightly better price at the Fitzwilliam than the above, including valet parking. 

Luas (tram) is right outside the Fitzwilliam entrance & will take you right to Dundrum shopping centre (balally stop) for extra shopping if needed...

Hotel is slightly quirky & very pleasantly colourful with great window seats in rooms

I have stayed here twice over the last few years. The first time I had a nice room overlooking St.Stephen's green. I was staying the night before a career-defining interview & needed a good night sleep. Unfortunately there was some buildings work outside, even late into the night. The Fitzwilliam kindly moved me to a quiet room away from the main road - I didn't have to waste time packing up & moving rooms - just slept in the other room & went back to my original room the next morning -was extremely grateful to their being so accommodating - had a great night's sleep & got my dream job. 

Staff very pleasant & helpful. 

Fitness centre is practically non-existent - small room with 3 cardio machines - not acceptable for a large 5 star hotel. 

I think it would be difficult to choose the Fitzwilliam over the other city centre 5 star hotels (the great buzz of the Shelbourne & pool & gym & fabulous breakfast, the 'everything is thought of' & perfect attention to detail of the Merrion) - but having said that the Fitzwilliam will charm you & will always leave you smiling...

Rooms that don't overlook the green are much more spacious ",4,2015,02,02
204,Not up to five star expected standard,The location is excellent and very central but this was the only benefit of the hotel. Given the cost and advertised 5 star standard it did not meet my expectations.the room could do with being repainted and overall didn't meet a 5 star standard.the breakfast was at most poor being almost cold and not great tasting.the staff however were friendly and helpful and the lady who brought ro service was  deserves a specific mention,3,2015,02,01
204,Excellent location,"This hotel is very well run. Staff are fantastic and the service is excellent. Worked on a corporate event here recently and out of all the hotels I work and stay in this is defiantly in my top 5. Cost, parking, quality of meeting rooms was all excellent for its location ",5,2015,01,27
204,Better second time around!,I posted a review before on trip advisor about this hotel stating that everything was lovely but the room was exceptionally small.  This time I was offered a larger bedroom.  Everything that was positive about the past room was still excellent but the extra space makes it really feel like a 5 star property.  Will definitely return.  ,5,2015,01,25
204,Very welcoming reception and comfortable rooms in central location.,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Great staff, very welcoming and excellent and efficient concierge. The room was spacious, comfy bed and quiet. The location was perfect for a weekend trip. Really close to good bars and restaurants. Tasty breakfast too, which is available until 11 on Saturday and 12 on Sunday - perfect if you've been exploring the bars of Dublin the night before. Would stay here again.",5,2015,01,25
204,pleasantly surprised,On one of our many visits to Dublin this was our first time to stay at The Fitzwilliam .   The price quoted was good (great offers available in January in Dublin) and the location is ideal for Grafton Street/Stephens Green.  The room was overlooking their garden/courtyard and was very peaceful.  The bed was extremely comfy and (very important) the pillows were lovely too! the breakfast was one of he nicest we have had in a 5star hotel.  We ate in the bar in the evening and the fish and chips were just incredible.  Sometimes we find that the well established 5 star hotels in Ireland can be very stuffy and the staff full of their own importance but the Fitzwilliam was an exception.  From the friendly staff at check-in  who then escorted us to our room and went through the layout with us to the bar staff and restaurant staff we were most impressed.  We will be back.,5,2015,01,20
204,Exceptional service,I stay in this hotel around 6 times per year and I think it's the best in Dublin and I have stayed in most of the 5 star hotels there. All staff are incredibly efficient and friendly but a special mention has to go to the Maître D in the Citron Restaurant called Kevin outstanding in his job and an absolute credit to the hotel. ,5,2015,01,17
204,A Genuine 5 Star Hotel,"From the moment I checked in to the Fitzwilliam hotel, I was made to feel welcome. The people are what really make it special and at every interaction, the hotel staff were kind, knowledgeable and personable. 

The decor is lovely. It's stylish and also comfortable and I felt right at home. Their in-room dining was delicious too and it had a creative menu that was a cut above most hotel restaurants. Breakfast was lovely as well there and, honestly, better than most options around that area!

Location wise, it's ideal if you'd like to be close to a ton of tourist attractions.",5,2015,01,14
204,Birthday stay!,Stayed here for my birthday. Received an upgraded room and welcome surprise of chocolates and card from staff. When I arrived I was shown to my room while my car was being parked. Breakfast was outstanding with a beautiful omelette freshly made on request. The location was so good we did not move the car for two days. Parking was much cheaper than expected at €10 per 24 hours most hotels were charging €20. Had a really enjoyable time. Staff were really wonderful to me. Couldn't have picked a nicer hotel in the centre of Dublin.,5,2015,01,12
204,Amazing overnight stay,Stayed here with my husband on the 12th of December. It was amazing! The staff were all so welcoming and friendly. Room was Spectacular overlooking the green! Best night away👍 would love to return Valentine's Day for our wedding anniversary,5,2015,01,09
204,good location & a very friendly staff,has a very good location close by crafton street and RCSI collage ( its surrounded by many restuarants and shopping stores). The hotel is like no other. It is by far the best european hotel i have stayed at. It is very clean and spacious. The staff is very friendly and hardworking. Unfortunatly if i could name them i would but i have forgotten their names.,5,2015,01,08
204,5Star all the way!,"We were in Dublin to celebrate my wife’s ? Birthday. The Fitzwilliam Hotel’s location on St Stephen’s Green made it a perfect location in which to stay. Across the road from the Green, adjacent to the shopping mecca that is Grafton Street, near the Tour Bus stop and numerous pubs and restaurants  it would be hard to find a better location. 
The check-in was easy and quick. Our room which overlooked the inner garden/courtyard was spacious, clean, well-appointed and pleasingly decorated. The bed was large and very comfortable. The toiletries were high quality. Complimentary Wi-Fi, in-room safe and mineral water were provided.
We ate dinner in the hotel’s Citron restaurant and found the quality and presentation of the food excellent. The breakfast was likewise with both Continental and cooked breakfast available.
Throughout our stay all the Staff were professional, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. There was genuine warmth to their welcome.
We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 day stay and highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2015,01,07
204,"If service defines a hotel quality, then we would rate it a 7 star hotel.","Location of the hotel is great, with the Luas just at its door step and Grafton Street just a stone throw away. Breakfast is also great. Staff attentiveness makes every breakfast most enjoyable.
Special commendation to the concierge team. Their attention to details makes us feel most privileged and welcomed. And we would like to especially thank Viktor, who has served nearly 14 years at the hotel. If you need any recommendation for good food, he is the man. His recommendations are better than the ratings in trip advisor. ",5,2015,01,06
204,"Lovely, Contemporary Hotel in a great location","I was impressed initially with the purple in the pictures when I made this reservation.  The staff made us feel so welcome from start to finish.  The bar served delicious cocktails.  The room was spacious, clean and well-appointed, and the bed was one of the best hotel beds I've ever slept on.  The view of St. Stephens Green was beautiful.  The FitzWilliam is in a great location, walking distance to lots of great food and sites.",5,2015,01,06
204,My favorite hotel in the world,"We loved, loved, loved this hotel. Great location near St. Stephen's Green, pubs, shopping, and Trinity College. The concierge and front desk staff was amazing.  Rooms were large, comfy, and much better than any other rooms we had in Europe. Make sure to get a package with breakfast to start your day right since it included omelets, eggs benedict, pancakes etc. Staff in the restaurant (thank you, Peter!) was helpful with recommendations for touring, eating, and pubs. Free Wi-Fi and free water in room. We felt comfortable hanging around the lobby and bar while we waited for friends. You cannot find a better hotel in Dublin.",5,2015,01,05
204,"Rooms were small, but cozy. Front desk and bell staff were truly steller!","Overall, a great hotel in a spectacular location at a very reasonable price. My only complaints were that the beds are very uncomfortable, not the sheets, but the actual mattress. Also, we were in an upgraded room and it felt very small even by European standards.",4,2015,01,04
204,"Location- Fab, Rooms-clean, staff- wonderful: Great Stay","Stayed for 3 nights after new year- best location in Dublin, everything in walking distance, great restaurants and bars nearby. Best rate suggested here on Trip advisor. Receptionist Joanne was fab- fixed our booking (bookings.com error), gave us a great room and drinks voucher for the bar. Room and bathroom was very clean and inviting. free wifi, thank you! reasonable overnight parking rate for city centre at 10 euro/night . Bedding and towels were rough, I hate feather bedding and pillows but they had non-feather pillows in the cupboard-thumbs up!  Staff in bar and front of house friendly and helpful. Tried to have breakfast on last morning but after sitting for 20+ minutes with cold toast and tea we gave up- apparently our order was lost- it was very quiet and staff werent busy. pity to end stay on that note. Would recommend and stay again but will get breakfast at Sister Sadie's, only a 10 minute walk and its the best we had in Dublin.",4,2015,01,04
204,Great hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam. The staff were especially friendly, genuine and attentive. Unfortunately our stay was so short and we didn't get to try the restaurants and bars, but they looked excellent. Great location, beautiful rooms... We'll definitely be back, thank you! ",5,2015,01,04
204,Always satisfied...,"I want to thank the staff and hotel with the exceptional service during our last visit.  We have stayed at the Fitzwilliam every time we are in Dublin from the states and they never fail to exceed our expectations.  For example, we arrived very early from an international flight (7:30 am) and while we requested an early check in I never thought they would be able to accommodate us at that hour.  Thank you again and we'll see you again soon.",5,2015,01,03
204,Great location,"I overnighted here before an early morning flight. My room overlooked St. Stephen's Green, lovely view, and no traffic noise due to excellent sound proofing on the window. Checkin and checkout were fast, friendly & efficient. Door staff were genuinely welcoming and helpful. Great location for Grafton Street shopping.",5,2015,01,03
204,Poor Night's Sleep,"Stayed here with my wife for some Christmas shopping.

Hotel's location is excellent, and is ideal for a shopping trip in Dublin.

Room was a good size. However, the walls were very thin, and we could hear everything next door. The a/c in the room was poor. I did report this to the receptionist when we went for dinner, only to return to find the solution was to leave the window open.

Apart from the issues with the room, the staff were very attentive and the breakfast was very tasty.",3,2015,01,01
204,Great Hotel,Wee decided to go to Dublin for a little break between Christmas and New Year. The hotel is in a great location the staff were fantastic. Our room was clean and the facilities excellent. Really great hotel.,5,2014,12,31
204,Christmas treat,We decided to have an overnight stay in Dublin. The hotel was really central and the staff were very pleasant and very efficient. Our room was on the 5 th floor and we had a pleasant enough view. The room was very nicely decorated and very clean. Nice toiletries. I was pleased tea and coffee making in the room. All in all an excellent hotel.,5,2014,12,31
204,Lovely Hotel,"This is my second stay here, its a lovely hotel in a great location. Staff on check in were efficient and concierge friendly and helpful. Room was lovely although the heat hit us as we walked into it. It was very cold outside, but this heat was overbearing. We couldn't see radiator in room to turn off. It was only next moring I saw vents behind and underneath couch that was blowing hot air which made for a very uncomfortable night.  
Shower was good but quite hard to regulate temperature.
Hate to rate so low as I like the hotel, but felt horrible after spending night in such a stuffy warm room. I did mention to the guy on reception as I checked out but he said we should have turned off radiator..",3,2014,12,31
204,"Breakfast service, what service?","arrived last night at the hotel and the reception staff were very efficient, our room over looks the garden which is pleasant and very quiet, if a little on the small side for the room rate. Breakfast was a buffet style plus a la carte dishes. We were seated by a chap in a suit who then walked away with explanation of how the breakfast serviced worked, so we sat and sat, as waiting staff rushed about clearing tables and ignoring people seated. Eventually grabbed the same suited chap and asked if we could order tea he said we could. He then walked away wiped a table and came back and asked what we would like! We then had to ask another waiter as nothing arrived. By the time the tea came we had eaten our breakfast and then had another wait for the toast to be told they had ran out of marmalade.
Can I suggest that tables are allocated to a waiter so everyone knows who's who and what's what.",2,2014,12,30
204,TERRIFIC !,"A great hotel with superb staff who were very helpful.
Rooms generous in size and immaculate.
Great location. I found the bar v good for a late night meal in a friendly atmosphere.
Breakfast was very good.
will return!",5,2014,12,20
204,Excellent Hotel in City Centre,"Great stay as always. Excellent staff and very comfortable rooms. Perfect location for a city centre stay. Breakfast is a little pricey but overall it's such a fabulous hotel that the bit extra that you pay really makes a big difference.
              ",5,2014,12,19
204,Good rooms but dull public areas,"Full marks for reading my booking profile.  I am a light sleeper and they helpfully gave me a very isolated room.  However it hacked with rain (well its Dublin after all) which drummed on the mansard window all night.
The bar is deeply dull, but its Dublin, so why would you not go out.  Breakfast is OK, but the coffee is truly horrific, but that fault isn't confined to the Fitzwilliam.
Polite and helpful staff throughout the hotel.",3,2014,12,18
204,Dublin’s Premier Five Star Hotel by a mile,"I seem to be visiting Dublin a lot recently and so for this latest trip I was booked into the Fitzwilliam on St Stephens Green.  Now this was a treat. Taxi right to the door and the very affable Tony greeted me ,  seamless check in and off to my room on the fifth floor ( bags were already there )  overlooking a sort of internal garden.   The room itself was luxurious to say the least and also quite large by five star city centre standards. It had a fabulously comfortable faux four poster bed, a good sofa two arm chairs a lovely window seat and a good working desk.  It had all the other extras one would expect of a five star, stacks of towels, great toiletries and very good, and free, wi fi.  The latter is important to me these days as so many International  five stars still charge for same, ridiculous.    The Hotel has a lovely intimae bar , very relaxing and the booths provide areas for quiet and private conversation.  Afternoon tea was a delight and service prompt and unobtrusive.  Later that night I got to sample a wonderful selection of Irish Craft beers before being taken out for dinner.  Even though this is a city centre Hotel, and without ear plugs this time , I slept like a baby, honestly you could have heard a pin drop, very impressed with this aspect of the Hotel.    Breakfast the following morning was fantastic, I had in room dining and ordered the Egg Florentine ( my fav breakfast ) and for the 2nd time this month in Dublin another superbly executed hollandaise. I did not get the change to dine in their  Michelin Star restaurant Thornton’s , I am told its only superb. One of the most impressive things about this Hotel were the staff from the concierge team to reception to room service all the way up to the lovely Fergal  (looks very young to be the GM)  and of course the gorgeous Bronagh.  I am sold on the Fitzwilliam, so well done to you all and a very  Happy Christmas.",5,2014,12,18
204,Great service great hotel,"From the moment we pulled up in our car, the great service began. Car was valet parked, luggage delivered to room, and prompt check in service. Room overlooked Stephen's Green, was plush, warm and clean. Ordered room service who catered very well for our 6 year old twins. Breakfast was fabulous and the smoothies were a big hit in the miniature milk bottles. When we checked out they were happy for us to leave our car while we did some shopping. This was our second stay in the Fitzwilliam, and we can't wait to return.",5,2014,12,15
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel,"I have stayed many times in the Fitzwilliam hotel, from you walk in the door you are made feel very welcome, door men & bar staff go the extra mile to help you. This was the first time I had my grandson with us (3 yrs) and all the staff went out of their way to help and be extra friendly towards him. I would not hesitate to recommend the Fitzwilliam hotel to anyone,

204,"""Attrocious Service""","Visited with my sister and elderly mum to finish off a perfect afternoon shopping.  On sitting down relieved to find a nice table, we ordered 3 Cocktails (€12.50 each). 30 minutes later, still nothing arrived.  After several requests, we asked for the Manager.  A young lady who we subsequently discovered was the Quality Service Manager, arrived and apologised for delay which she said was due to new staff.  Totally inexcusable., certainly for a 5star Hotel.  
We eventually got and unfortunately, they were of such poor quality, we returned and were offered 3 new drinks.   Saga continues..... Gins were about 15minutes arriving..... just not acceptable.    Couple beside us preceeded to also   complain due to such bad service.  They were staying In the Hotel.  Staff were mostly young and inexperienced.

Manager was overwhelmed totally with her setup in the Bar.....she gave us the drinks FOC at the end of it upon us paying the bill.... hard to recommend after our terrible, frustrating experience. .",3,2014,12,14
204,Terrible service ,"Stayed 1 night in this hotel. Service is appalling. Gangs of waiting staff at bar/breakfast. No body taking any responsibility for orders drinks etc. v poor management. Didn't have a problem with it otherwise room were lovely, location was great, girls on reception very helpful & friendly. But I have to say my bad experience of the waiting service here makes me wonder about their 5 star status. They are certainly charging 5 star prices. I for one will be staying elsewhere next time. ",1,2014,12,14
204,Great Location,"We stayed here with friends in Dublin in Nov for one night, It was a fabulous location for shopping & within walking distance to great bars & restaurants. Our room was lovely , spotless & nothing was too much trouble for all the wonderful staff.  The breakfast was excellent --lots of great options.We had some cocktails in the bar which were heavenly but unfortunatey we didn't get time to eat in their top restaurants. We can't wait to return .",5,2014,12,12

204,Christmas Shopping,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel when on a Christmas shopping trip to Dublin. What a lovely hotel located next to Grafton Street. Staff very friendly and efficient.  Rooms average size, but with everything you could want in them. Food lovely. Hope to return there on my next overnight stay in Dublin",5,2014,12,10
204,Ideal for Christmas Shopping,Stayed last weekend  with my daughter. From valet parking   to check in to concierge  service the staff couldn't  have been more helpful . Location was perfect for shopping  on Grafton  Street  as was a 2 minute walk to shops. Room was lovely.Breakfast  cooked to order  so no overcooked rashers sitting on a tray. Will definitely  go back again.,5,2014,12,09

The room was nice sized, and well decorated.  The bed was large and comfortable.  Huge pillows.  Nice bathroom.",5,2014,12,07
204,Staff is incredibly attentive and friendly,"Yes, the location is super convenient and the room is comfortable.....but what really differentiates this hotel is the staff. From the front desk, to the concierge, to the wait-staff, every staff member that we encountered was incredibly attentive and friendly. When we asked ""where can we get a taxi,"" the concierge literally walked us down the street to the taxi ramp! And, soon after we met the friendly Sales Manager in the elevator, two glasses of wine appeared at our room.  And when we asked about directions, or restaurant recommendations or suggestions on what (and what not) to do, everyone jumped to help us....and followed up the next day with ""how'd that go?"" and ""what can we help you with today."" 

If I could, I'd give the staff 6 stars!",5,2014,12,05
204,Quality hotel in convenient location,Stayed a night at this hotel and would recommend it.  The location of this hotel just on the edge of St Stephen's Green at the top of Grafton Street is ideal for city centre activities.  Highly recommended.,5,2014,12,03
204,Excelent Location,"This hotel is very chic and trendy.  Hotel is very clean and next to a shopping center and all area attractions just with a little walk.  Excelent service, breakfast is very good with many options.  Very quiet.",5,2014,12,03
204,Great all round experience,"Living in Asia you tend to get spoilt by service which seems secondary elsewhere, however the Fitzwilliam was a shining light for European hotels.
Booking was handled efficiently and all was in order upon arrival. We did however arrive quite early and whilst they couldn't cater for an early check-in they were only to happy to make arrangements for our comfort.
The Concierge services were excellent, friendly and very helpful - some good suggestions and made arrangements for us at a dining venue that we wanted to eat at that evening.
The hotel staff are all very friendly and attentive.  The rooms were very clean and well appointed, it was a very comfortable stay.
The only issue we had were that there were guests arriving into the early hours of the Sunday morning (there was a big sporting event in Dublin on the Saturday night), the hotel doors tend to shut easily but very loudly, so you tended to hear patrons returning. In addition, the shopping centre next door seemed to be preparing for Christmas as there was quite a bit of noise coming from there during the very early hours of Sunday morning. Having mentioned this to the staff they were only too pleased to arrange an alternative room for us, a slight inconvenience but extremely well handled.
If I had to criticize anything, it would be that the apples in the lift lobbies are only green apples and I prefer red.",5,2014,12,02
204,Best Spot in Dublin,Recently had the pleasure of staying at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights.  From the moment we arrived we were treated great. The front desk staff and all members of the concierge staff are the best.  They go head over heels to help you in any way possible.  Though the hotel was filled it still remained a very quiet comfortable hotel. The location across from St Stephen Green and a few short steps from Grafton Street cannot be beaten.  Definitely will return to this top notch hotel.,5,2014,12,01
204,Staff made this place ,"I travel a lot. Came here for an event I was running at the venue. 
Stay here for the exceptional staff. Attentive anywhere I went. Getting rid of a drunk woman who was annoying us. Special request at breakfast. Putting up with my change of mind through the event with grace and a smile. Best ever event staff person. Migle. She should be promoted. Immediately. 
Why 4 stars? Bar was lacking in atmosphere and room service menu a bit boring.  Exceptional room staff and amenities. Restaurant variety with a Michelin star on site. Close to good shopping. ",4,2014,11,30
204,Exceptional - Luxurious and Welcoming,"I have stayed in the Fitzwilliam on numerous occasions - it is the only place I would consider staying in Dublin. The location is the best in Dublin, the decor is so chic, the rooms spacious and comfortable, the staff are unbelievably accommodating and welcoming. The breakfast is delicious as well - I would recommend the french toast. I can't recommend the Fitzwilliam highly enough.",5,2014,11,29
204,Amazing!!,"Upon arrival we got upgraded from a queen room to a suite; and it was amazing!!! 
The facilities, staff, and overall hotel experience was definitely 5* 
A lovely stay and cannot recommend highly enough this hotel! ",5,2014,11,29
204,Exceptional Hotel,"This is my third time staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin.  The location is excellent - easy walk to all sites throughout the city.  Luxury hotel that maintains a warm and welcoming atmosphere.  Beautiful rooms and amenities.  Great staff.  Three great restaurants - food exceptional - wait staff are knowledgeable, friendly and provide great service.  I would not think of staying anywhere else the next time I am in Dublin.",5,2014,11,26
204,Christmas shopping,"Excellent location, all staff very friendly, beautiful hotel, lovely bar/lounge area serving beautiful food and beverages, excellent selection. Rooms very comfortable, although were very warm, had to leave air con running overnight, excellent facilities in room, though a biscuit would have been nice to have with the tea/coffee. Would highly recommend.",5,2014,11,24
204,"Excellent service, location and facilities","Stayed a 7 nights with my wife and 15 mth daughter. We received excellent service from everyone in the staff! The staff felt genuinely friendly and caring! 
The location is great within walking distance of many of Dublin's sights. Being close to St Stephen's Green was a big bonus, especially for our daughter.
The room was good size and we never felt that anything was missing.
The breakfast is one of the best we've had with lots of nice items that you can order from the kitchen.
Will definitely return!",5,2014,11,22
204,Excellent service,I stayed here on business for one night and the staff went out if their way to ensure I had a good experience. The food in the citron restaurant was also excellent. I would definitely return to this lovely hotel. ,5,2014,11,21
204,An absolute keeper.,"This is one of my favorite hotels, worldwide. One of my favorite things to do is to wake up first thing, get in a great run through the City, grab breakfast, and head into St. Stephen's Green ... right across the street from this wonderful hotel. The staff simply could not be better - the facilities exactly what I need and want. Thoroughly recommend this hotel; some things in life are simply worth a little extra.",5,2014,11,19
204,Fabulous experience,"while this is not a necessarily cheap place to stay, the staff and how they treat you definitely make you feel as though you're getting a bargain.  couldn't be happier with the experience and the courtesy and helpfulness of all of the staff regardless of who it was, it didn't matter.  Had a great stay and experience.",5,2014,11,18
204,Many thanks to the staff of this truly delightful hotel for a memorable stay for my daughter's 18th birthday!,"Our two night stay was a pure delight;  The staff were kind and competent and always there to cater to our slightest whim or produce a giant umbrella so it didn't matter that the rain never stopped.  Room was quiet and relaxing overlooking inner garden.  We had room service for dinner and breakfast the following morning and both were excellent.  Staff always had a smile!  Loved the decor of the room with the low sofa set in front of window complete with orchid.  My daughter loved the chocolates and note so thoughtfully delivered to wish her a happy 18th!  Great location too both for shopping, culture or sightseeing.  We had dinner at Citron on our second and last night and this was excellent too.  I shouldn't say any more or there'll be no room left for us next time!  Many thanks to you all including Tony at the door who mistook me for an American actress!  You're doing a marvellous job!  See you soon, I hope!",5,2014,11,17
204,Fantastic Location and Staff,I loved this property.  I stayed here in June of 2013.  I have stayed at the Clarence and the Hilton nearby but this location was amazing.  The staff and facilities were nothing short of fantastic.  We enjoyed the bar and the shower in the room was incredible.  I will return anytime I find myself in Dublin.,5,2014,11,15
204,Modern hotel in Dublin,"The hotel is very well located and has great commercial areas around to visit and shop. Public transportation available at the hotel door, which is most welcome to increase mobility at a reduced cost. The hotel staff are very hospitable and very polite. The hotel has a friendly bar to have some drinks before dinner. The room was European sized and comfortable, with a large window. Bed and linens of great quality makes you sleep like a baby. Breakfast is well served with hot breakfast available on demand. A good choice.",4,2014,11,12
204,Fantastic hotel,The level of professionalism and friendliness in this hotel is overwhelming. The fitzwilliam truly understand how to treat their guests. I cannot recommend their accommodation enough for both it's comfort and proximity to everything in Dublin.,5,2014,11,10
204,Great Hotel would recommend ,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night, the hotel is clean, friendly and has an amazing location.

All staff were welcoming and friendly.

The rooms are very clean and the bath was enormous, nice dressing gowns, good toiletries and soft towels.

The hotel is at the end of Grafton St so in the middle of everything!

",5,2014,11,09
204,Awesome trip,"Can't say enough about the staff at Fitzwilliam.  We arrived from the US at the buttcrack of dawn after flying all night.  Did not expect to have our room available to us that early in the morning and sure enough it was not.  But a very kind young man at the desk provided us with a room to catch some sleep and shower.  That really saved us from walking the streets all day like zombies.  Rooms were a bit small but nicely appointed.  We were greeted warmly each day by the concierge and doorman.  We spent 7 nights here and thoroughly enjoyed your wonderful city.  Each day we ended with a nightcap pint in the hotel bar.  Location was superb, staff except for one aloof bartender was very friendly.  Highly recommend!",5,2014,11,07
204,Lovely short stay,"Stayed here for just one night after flying in from Australia. Wish we could have stayed longer! Lovely quiet comfortable hotel, very well finished, right in the heart of the city. Bed was comfortable and all staff we came across were friendly and helpful. Loved it.
      ",5,2014,11,07
204,Well worth It,Love everything about this hotel. We arrived in the city on a super early flight and while we id make arrangements for an early check in the hotel accommodated us right away and we were given a room. The hotel itself is beautiful and has everything to offer. The location is ideal for shopping and exploring. Well it is expensive all the bonuses make your stay well worth it.,5,2014,11,06
204,Poor customer service,"Appalling bar service. The staff were completely disinterested in serving us. The hotel itself is in a fantastic location and the check-in was quick. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I will not be returning to this hotel.

204,World class,We booked two rooms beside other top floor balcony overlooking the green amazing views attention to detail baloncy heaters rugs great waiter service    breakfast couldnt fault  staff professional and inviting bar really good  decor ambience everthing first class   i just mention how nice the bread was and on checking out recieved a few fresh loafs to take home wonderful  will go again and again,5,2014,11,03
204,"Great location, excellent hotel","We chose this hotel because it has such an excellent location.  The staff at the Fitzwilliam were more attentive and friendly than any other hotel I have stayed at.  There is definitely a focus on service.  The rooms were clean, attractive with very comfortable bed and pillows.  ",5,2014,11,03
204,Faultless!,"Stayed here last month for one night whilst on business. Staff were very friendly and welcoming, couldn't do enough for you. Room was spacious and extremely well appointed. Everything was spotlessly clean. Breakfast catered for every taste (they make a mean bowl of porridge!) Hotel overall was well decorated and had a real quality feel about it. Would book again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,11,02
204,Beautiful ,"Lovely hotel, great location for grafton street. Room small enough for price but comfortable with lovely shower gels and robes etc. 
Breakfast was amazing, best I ever had, gorgeous smoothies, full fry and we were greedy with pancakes afterwards too! Lovely stay. ",5,2014,11,02
204,"Elegant, Quiet, & Well-Located","Located across from St. Stephen's Green, at the end of Grafton Street shopping, around the corner from the Gaiety Theatre, and within easy walking distance of Trinity College and museums, it would be difficult to find a more convenient place to stay. But that is only the beginning. The rooms are comfortable, functional, and attractive. The bathroom is well lighted and has a combined tub and shower, large sink, storage space for your own toiletries, and nice soap, lotion, shampoo, and conditioner. Our 2nd floor room looked out onto a green lawn that was not accessible and therefore quite private. Wi-fi service with a strong signal was included in the price. Breakfast (also included) was varied and delicious, and staff were very willing to make accommodations for some dietary restrictions. Room service was prompt and tasty. One day when I was staying in because of a cold, the room service waiter brought peppermint tea with my order saying that he thought I had a cold and this would help -- charming. It was easy to find a snack in the downstairs bar/restaurant, and there were always fresh apples by the elevators. Although the desk clerks seemed a little hazy at times, the concierges that we worked with were excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed our 6-night stay and would highly recommend the hotel to others.",5,2014,10,31
204,"Wonderful Hotel, Exceptional Staff","The rooms were very nicely appointed, everything - including the bed - was extremely comfortable, and the staff really could not have been more helpful. In particular, the concierge Victor really made heroic efforts for us on everything from securing crazy glue for some eyeglass repair to getting reservations at the restaurants we wanted to getting business documents printed for us when we needed them. The breakfasts were delicious, and the staff very tolerant of our jet-lagged late arrivals. Location can't be beat. Excellent experience overall.",5,2014,10,31
204,Great hotel in prime location,"We stayed here during our first ever trip to Ireland. The hotel is fantastic, in a prime location just across from St. Stephen's Green and close to great shopping. It's walking distance to many hot spots and tourist attractions. We'll definitely stay again!",5,2014,10,31
204,Superb location,"This five star hotel is directly across from St. Stephen's Green and the south end of Grafton Street, Dublin 's trendy shopping scene. The Temple Bar district is within a few blocks for anyone looking to immerse themselves in the traditional Irish pub culture.  Rooms are spacious by European standards and kept spotless by friendly and attentive staff.  We had no difficulty acquiring an early check-in and were served a complimentary beverage in the bar as baggage was taken to our room.  Arrangements were made by a cheerful concierge for taxi service, tour recommendations, rail tickets on the day of our departure, and much more.  The Green Line of Dublin's light rail system lies just outside the front door for fast access to O'Connel train station.  Our five day holiday was made worry free and utterly fantastic by this wonderful establishment.",5,2014,10,28
204,Convenient solution,"The hotel looks like an expensive one with people opening the door and offering to help with the luggage and stuff, a mantelpiece burning on one side of the hall. But we had a good bargain in a busy bank holiday weekend. Just on the brinks of St. Stephen's Green, it is at a few steps from central shopping streets.

Friendly and competent staff at the reception, clear instructions were given, everything was quick and smooth. The rooms are not very large, let's say decently sized, but the bathroom is well equipped and has a nice bathtub and shower. Complimentary wi-fi is nowadays a must, and the hotel has it, details have been provided without asking (very good!).

Maybe at the reception the offers for extras (paid) were a little bit too many, but all in all it was very reasonable and not overdone.

Under the condition to find good prices, this hotel can offer a lot to the casual visitor to Dublin who wants to stay in the center of the city without being ripped off.",4,2014,10,27
204,Genuinely lovely staff,"Lovely, luxurious hotel right in the centre but still very quiet but the staff were the best selling point of this hotel, genuinely lovely and so helpful! We had an amazing meal in the Citron hotel and the breakfast was AMAZING also! Comfy beds and really nice smellies in the bathroom!",5,2014,10,26
204,Nothing to worry about,"The place functions in every way. It is nice, well situated and has a friendly staff. A good place to stay at and recommend. The breakfast serving was good as well! It would be hard not to consider for my next visit.",4,2014,10,24
204,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff",We were in a room with a balcony overlooking St. Stephen's Green -- high enough that the street noise wasn't troublesome and lovely to sit on and watch the autumn trees in the park. Staff was marvelous.,5,2014,10,23
204,Super hotel and reservation,"A wonderful hotel in great location just by Grafton Street. Really well trained and helpful staff, superb restaurant for breakfast and dinner (Citron) and the option of a Michelin starred Thornton restuarant also. We have previously stayed at the Shelbourne but the Fitz is one we will return to. Note - parking is integral to the hotel in a secure and cheap private garage in the basement. Driving through Dublin can be an interesting experience unless you plan ahead!",5,2014,10,22
204,spot on,"As mentioned by some others the staff were fantastic and the extra mile they went to make my partners 60th birthday a even more memorable one made the price worth while.
great location for the shops and bars along Grafton street and about a ten minute walk from the expensive Temple Bar area.
We didnt try the breakfast as we went to Bewleys in Grafton Street, which is worth a visit.
The bar is well stocked and is comfortable to sit and chat till the early hours as it is open 24hrs to residents.
Getting to the hotel from the airport takes around 30-45 minutes depending on the time of day but be aware  the prices vary from the modes of transport available so check them out first.

A comfortable hotel which I plan to re-visit some time",5,2014,10,21
204,location location location,"The Hotel is in an excellent location 
The hotel staff offers impeccable service 
Nice rooms although a little small 
Generous breakfast with a rich selection 
Substantial disadvantage is the very high cost",4,2014,10,20
204,WONDERFUL,From the moment we arrived the staff made us feel so welcome they were friendly and so helpful nothing was too much trouble for them.We stayed in room 204 which is a deluxe premier room it was fab it had a huge bed and a massive free standing bath.The breakfast was lovely there was lots of choice so there is something for everybody to enjoy.The hotel is situated near all the sites so everything is in walking distance which is great.All in all i have nothing bad to say about this hotel it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in we will certainly be going back.,5,2014,10,20

The staff are amazing and The Citron restaurant serves excellent food at a reasonable price.
Happy to recommend to anyone looking for a luxury break in Dublin.",5,2014,10,19
204,A Gem,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin,in all categories, is exceptional in every single respect. Accommodations and  service is flawless, and delivered with the warmth and charm as Dublin itself and and their wonderful people that make a visit a lifetime memory. Perfectly located with every detail attended to, and not by accident.  ",5,2014,10,19
204,Great location,Had a signature room on the second floor overlooking the garden. Room was very nice but the bathroom needed some TLC as around the bath and sink were slightly grubby. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Located just by Grafton Street and only a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar. Roughly 30 Euros for a taxi to/from Dublin Airport. Nice hotel.,4,2014,10,18
204,Great Dublin Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is a great place to stay. Located close to the center of the city it was within easy walking distance of many attractions--Grafton Street is steps away. The staff is fantastic and the rooms are comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.
      ",5,2014,10,17
204,Not 5 stars in my world !,"This 4 star hotel is very well located but with very small rooms.  Its outdated and there are no amenities, the gym is very poor located in a small room and no spa.  Again, who rates this hotels trying to trick customers that they are a 5 star hotel ?!?!  I will go back to Dublin is a fun and happening city but I will look for a true 5 star.",3,2014,10,17
204,Old world style hotel and service,"Fantastic comfortable hotel, great bathrooms and central to the best area in Dublin. Service from the staff here is best in class. Really enjoyed my stay and would bring my wife back for a holiday.

I got a room at the back of the Hotel overlooking the central courtyard which was incredibly quiet. May try the noisier front rooms looking over St Stephen's Green next time. ",5,2014,10,16
204,Great Hotel,We had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam for our final leg of our Ireland trip. We were there for 3 nights and had a very lovely room. We had stayed in quite of few B&B's along the way so it was nice to have a bath tub to soak in for a change. They do a lot of little extras (e.g. chocolates at night). The hotel is reasonably priced and is right in the downtown area. The staff are also very helpful.,5,2014,10,15
204,Best Hotel in Dublin!!!,"Can not say enough about our hotel experience at the Fitzwilliam !  Comfort,service,location,food,and most of all the friendliness and welcoming engaging attitude by all.  Attention to detail in every aspect.  This ""is"" the place to stay in Dublin!",5,2014,10,10
204,Perfect!,"This hotel is the embodiment of quality service. At each interaction with the staff, we knew we were their top priority! A bit of background... We'd been traveling most of the day - in the rain - and arrived in Dublin during rush hour. There was some road construction and we actually got a bit confused and stopped at this hotel thinking it was where we had our reservation. Not so. But, they took care of changing the reservation, got us safely into a beautiful room and made all sorts of wonderful recommendations for our walking exploration of Dublin. The entire experience - accommodations, food, staff, location - all just lovely!!",5,2014,10,07
204,Best of the best,Great hotel to stay in - this is a 6 star hotel. The rooms are gorgeous with so many free-bies and nice touches like hand made chocolates and candles.  Brilliant location for shopping and dining.  Modern Ireland.,4,2014,10,07
204,Loves this hotel!,"The Fitzwilliam in Dublin is an excellent hotel. It's nicely decorated and we got a great room with a little window sitting area. There were chocolates waiting for us in the room, and they brought chocolates every night when they did the turndown service. I enjoy nice touches like that. My only complaint is that the water temperature fluctuated a lot during one of my showers. It only happened once and that just happens sometimes. Not a huge deal. 

We ate dinner in Citron one night and it was very good. We also had our breakfasts there in the morning. Unlike the other hotels on this trip, you ordered your hot food instead of getting it at the buffet. We enjoyed the freshness of that. 

The location is great. It's right off Grafton Street with a nice park across the street. We walked to all the places we wanted to go. Trinity College, Temple Bar, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin Castle, etc. 

We highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. ",5,2014,10,05
204,Very nice stay!,"This hotel differs from the other 5-star hotels in area by having stylish design choices rather than the traditional, classic decor. The location is perhaps the very best for enjoying Dublin City Centre if traveling on holiday.  It overlooks St Stephens Green and is close to Grafton Street, restaurants, nightlife, museums, etc.  The rooms differ by type and can be a bit small so check the hotel website.  I have no problem with a small room if it has a comfortable bed and has some style, and we found our room and the entire hotel to be chic and stylish.  We had a deluxe room on 4th floor with a small balcony overlooking Stephens Green which we enjoyed each morning.  The bathrooms need a bit of updating from wear, but extremely clean and well appointed.  The staff were outstanding and very welcoming throughout our 5-day stay.  Will definitely visit again when in Dublin.",5,2014,10,02
204,Effortlessly classy,"Just spent one night at the Fitzwilliam and it is one of the finest hotels I've ever came across. It exudes class yet with the right balance between friendliness and formality. The location is superb, right on St Stephens Green with an abundance of shops, restaurants and bars close at hand. From the moment you arrive, you will be bowled over by the efficiency and manner of the staff. Valet parking for 10 Euros a night, immaculate fixtures and fittings, huge, plush corridors and beautifully appointed rooms. It's the little things in hotels that separate the good from the great. And so it is the plants in rooms, monogrammed towels and robes, in room music systems with speakers set within the walls, huge bath, super comfy beds, window seats and vintage telephones that set the Fitzwilliam apart. The bar is again classy but not aloof that Sky Sports wouldn't feature. The breakfast (food and service) also wonderful. It was a pleasure from arrival to departure and I will seek it out again when I return to Dublin.",5,2014,10,02
204,Excellent,"Stayed 3 nights for our wedding anniversary.  Couldn't fault it.  Inner courtyard facing room on the second floor.  Comfortable bed, great bathroom.  Only had breakfast one morning (in-room) as we were room only and there are plenty of cheaper coffee shops and eateries nearby.  Location perfect at the foot of Grafton Street right opposite St Stephen's Green, a lovely park for a stroll in the sunshine.  Planning our next trip to Dublin already and will probably stay at the Fitz again.",5,2014,10,02
204,The Very Place To Stay in Dublin,Wonderful hotel and great location to everything.  Close to Trinity and right across the street from St Stephen's Green.  Our room overlooked the beautiful park.  Rooms were very comfortable and the service was excellent,5,2014,10,01
204,"Great location, a few things were disappointing","We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam and absolutely loved the location.   It is a boutique hotel or seemed to be so the rooms were small but manageable.   We dealt with the Concierge a few times during our stay and they really didn't seem very knowledgeable, more so the younger gentlemen.  I don't think our inquiries were that difficult, but I would say that when ever we had a question about the area, we didn't really get a 'confident' answer from the Concierge.   Because you can't check out on line, you had to go to the reception desk to get your bill and check out.   There was only one person working the desk when I got in line.  There were two gentlemen who had obviously been standing there for a long time as they were both grumbling and when the first person finally got help, the phone rang and the person working the desk (alone)  answered it, continuing to assist the person on the phone making the already unhappy customer stand there to wait again.  He finally walked away.   A second person finally came running to Reception to assist the now four waiting customers.  Overall, I would say the location is really the best thing about the hotel.  Seems like the staff needs more training to be rated so highly.  Additionally the internet was basically useless, even though you could log in to it, it was virtually unusable.   We needed it because that was our source of inquires of the area due to the Concierge not being super helpful.   I hate writing this because I loved the people, the area etc.   But these were observations that I think need attention to keep future customers wanting to come back.",3,2014,09,29
204,Great Service,"Nice hotel with great staff; the bathrooms are tired and in need of upgrades but the room was clean and the staff did there best to make our stay as best as possible. The quality of the TV and available channels was an issue.  There during Ryder Cup which was not available in our room
      ",4,2014,09,29
204,Charming Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Our flight got us into Dublin mid morning, too early for check in.  We were warmly received by the bellman as well as the reception staff.  They held our bags and asked housekeeping to rush the preparation of our room. While waiting, we wandered out to Grafton Street in search of a traditional Irish breakfast which we found at a local pub called Bruxelles...delicious! The room was ready by the time we returned and we were personally escorted  by staff and given information about amenities.  Our bags were delivered shortly after.  The room was beautifully decorated, warm and cozy with a box window seat overlooking a small courtyard...very quiet, no street noise.  Impeccably clean.
Great location for shopping, dining, and transportation.  Walking distance to Temple Bar,  Trinity College, Liffey River, across the street from St. Stephen's Green Park and Grafton Street.
Although we made our own tour arrangements, we requested taxi service for early am travel to the train station. They were always on time and some of the friendliest people we've ever met!
Only issue we had was spotty WI FI, but overall, an excellent choice for accommodations in  Dublin.  Friendly, helpful staff, beautiful hotel!  We would stay here again!",5,2014,09,29
204,You get what you pay for,"Just back from a weekend in Dublin and found the Fitzwilliam the perfect place to stay both for the hotel itself and it's location. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for and we were very impressed with the hotel. From check in where we we taken to our room by the receptionist and shown all the facilities, to the excellent food available. The room was lovely with complimentary internet that worked and was speedy, well decorated and spotlessly clean. Thornton's restaurant was excellent and we're still full from a lavish breakfast. Lot's of little extras around the hotel like fresh fruit available and welcoming cold water in the lobby. We would highly recommend this hotel and will be our first choice when we return to Dublin.",5,2014,09,28
204,Boutique hotel,"We loved our stay at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin. From the porter unloading our car and taking it away to a safe park; the friendly and welcoming reception staff; the cosy bar; the modernly furnished rooms; and the delicious dinner served in the restaurant, it was a great place to stay.",5,2014,09,28
204,Great location and very helpful staff,My husband and I were thrilled with the location in the heart of activity. Loved being so close to Grafton street. The room was nice and the concierge staff was awesome. The concierge booked a day tour for us and the tour company made a mistake. The concierge staff went above and beyond to rebook us and for us to receive a complimentary tour. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.,5,2014,09,27
204,"""Lovely meal,good value!""","We dined in the Citron Restaurant last night. We had been here in June of this year, so we knew to expect a good menu..
 The food was lovely, I especially liked the crab starter, with flavours of carrot jelly , orange and fennel . It was deliciously light and refreshing. 
The salmon mains was very enjoyable,served with stir fry vegetables , noodles and miso soup.
 I had the pineapple dessert , this was really great, grilled pineapple with a rum caramel sauce and warm sponge .. also some chilled pineapple with a sorbet, delicious , the contrast between the warm and cold was really nice. It felt like two desserts in one... With a nice glass of wine , a lovely meal. The staff as always were attentive and friendly and very efficient. Definitely worth a visit!!!",4,2014,09,26
204,Great location and great service,Heading to Dublin?  You would love staying here.   Rooms were very comfortable and a very convenient location. We walked our the door and we were right on Grafton Street.  Just a short walk from anywhere!   Love it!  Thanks for taking great care of us.,5,2014,09,24
204,Very nice hotel in a very central location,"Lovely room, helpful staff, and the perfect location -  quiet but easy walking distance to everything you could want to see or do in Dublin: Trinity, Temple Bar, Grafton St, the cathedrals, shopping, dining, drinking, you name it.",5,2014,09,23
204,Extremely disappointed,"
Myself and my wife stayed recently in The Fitzwilliam hotel on 11 September for one night. This was a special treat to celebrate our tenth wedding anniversary and we were really looking forward to our first stay in this hotel.
However, from the minute we arrived we experienced embarrassment. There was confusion at checkin regarding our booking. We were told that our booking did not include breakfast. We then proceeded to produce a copy of our confirmation stating that we had booked and paid for room and breakfast. This confirmation didn't seem to satisfy the hotel who then stated that the booking was our problem and the issue was between us and the website. We requested that she consult the manager as we assumed that there was nothing wrong with our booking.At this stage we were quite embarrassed as several guests were waiting to check in.
Later that evening we received a phone call to our room from Hotel Manager Maria who apologised for the communication error at reception. A bottle of wine and was sent to our room along with an apology.
We assumed that this would be the end of any issues only to face more embarrassment the following morning at breakfast. Yet again we were told that we had not paid for breakfast and would be charged accordingly. Luckily we had  brought the letter from Maria with us and had to produce it to the lady at the breakfast reception and explain over again that we had actually paid for breakfast with our online booking. We were both really annoyed at this stage. 
We spoke with the manager before we checked out and asked us to give the hotel another chance as it had failed to live up to its five star service during our stay. 
The following week we were shocked to find a charge on our credit card for two breakfasts. We contacted the hotel who agreed to refund the charge and apologised again for the error.
We cannot understand how a 5 star hotel could not sort out something as small as breakfast which was already paid for!",2,2014,09,22
204,Wonderful hotel experience,"We splurged and had a room on the 5th floor, which included a view of St Stephen's Green, and a private patio.  The room was large, spacious and very well appointed.  The location was excellent, and staff were great.  The concierge staff was very helpful and patient with explaining how to get around, and as well made some great recommendations to things to do while we were there for only 2 days.  Highly recommend staying here!",5,2014,09,22
204,"Great Hotel, Professional Service","We really enjoyed this hotel. Very clean, wonderful staff, and very close to the city center and directly across the street from St Stephen's Green. We didn't need a cab most of the time, everything is really within walking distance. Would definitely stay here again ",5,2014,09,21
204,Great Stay in Dublin,Our family just returned from a 2 week Ireland vacation to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday.  Our travel agent booked us at The Fitzwilliam and it was wonderful.  The staff (ask for Corah!) was amazingly attentive and were accomodating to our request of being put in rooms near each other.  The rooms are not large but very attractive and comfortable.  Excellent breakfasts!  Location couldn't be better...right on St. Stephen's Green and close to all the Dublin attractions.  Highly recommend this lodging if you're in DUblin.,5,2014,09,20
204,Great property with a wonderful staff,"I scored a very good deal on Expedia for the Fitzwilliam Hotel, and could not have been happier with the property and its customer service-oriented staff. Not only is the hotel situated in a perfect position, near Saint Stephens Green, and within walking distance of most of Dublin's city centre, but the hotel staff went above and beyond to make my stay wonderful. I arrived in Dublin at 5 a.m. Obviously, when I arrived at the hotel, no rooms were available. However, the hotel staff did their best to have me in a room as early as possible and even accommodated my request for a quiet room.

My room was quiet, almost too much so! I'm a light sleeper, but here, I was comfortable and had absolutely no noise in my room. The room itself was well-appointed with a comfortable bed, multiple pillows and a great deep soaking tub that's nice to come home to after a day on your feet. I loved the nightly turn-down service and I'll admit that the chocolates on the pillow spoiled me during my stay and were such a nice touch.

The staff, from the front desk to the waiters to the concierge to housekeeping were absolutely wonderful and helpful and went out of their way to make my stay enjoyable.

If I'm ever back in Dublin, I will not hesitate to stay at the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2014,09,18
204,lovely stay,"Seamless check in, really helpful concierge and staff. Great room, lovely bathroom and amazing shower! We were celebrating and were very chuffed to receive chocolates and a congratulations note. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!",5,2014,09,18
204,Good hotel with friendly staff in great location,"My first stay here. I am an Irish man living overseas. The staff are very helpful. The rooms are good although maybe a touch smaller than I expected. It has a really good feel. Breakfast is good.
Great restaurant attached; see review.
Only down side is the gymn as important for me when travelling to exercise. It is very small with just a few machines and some dumbbells. 
Location is great.",4,2014,09,13
204,Fitzwilliam in Dublin is very well located and delightful as well.,"We arrived in the lovely city of Dublin on August 21st after a flight from Chicago which had been delayed by 4 hours.  To our delight our room was available.  The room we had was a standard room with twin beds and a strange little couch arrangement under the large window.  I wish I had taken a photo of the room but if you go to their website you will see what I mean.  It was contemporary in decor and very neat and clean.  The included breakfast was delicious and the location of the restaurant was appealing.  We were treated courteously and everyone was very kind and friendly.  I would slip a coin under my plate after breakfast and was assured that it was appropriate and most welcome.  The concierge arranged for two dinner reservations for us which was appreciated and helped up with directions and recommendations for pubs and things to do and see.  There was an electric kettle complete with makings for tea and coffee as well as hot chocolate in the room.  That was delightful after a day of walking all over town.  There were very nice amenities in the bathroom but beware...if you are short or not very agile, it will be difficult to get in and out of the tub to bathe or shower.  The lip of the tub is very high off the ground.  We paid $317 per night including breakfast which was as enormous as you wanted it to be.  We stepped out of our door and walked 1/2 block to the pedestrian streets of Dublin.  Full of shops, churches, museums, buskers, pubs, restaurants and very friendly people.  The four of us took a cab from the airport and it cost 30 pounds, which we didn't think was bad as a bus would have been 7 pounds each and we would have had to lug our bags for 10 minutes to reach the hotel at the closet bus stop.  The cabby was full of useful and funny information too.  I'm sure you could find a nice hotel for less money but we wanted to be sure to stay at someplace nice and within walking distance of many places.",4,2014,09,12
204,Well done.,"Howdy, first of five elite hotels and it more than held its own against all of the hotels. The location was just a stone throw from all the action. The concierge was helpful, the room was clean, and the breakfast was amazing. All basic ammentities included, highly recommend this hotel. Only con was the valet was a little forward but that's their job so its understandable. 5 stars",5,2014,09,11
204,Great staff and central situation,"Very kind staff especially the concierge group, rooms not enormous but very clean and well looked after. Good breakfast and very central location make this an excellent hotel for visiting Dublin. We went to the theatre close by and had an excellent evening. Don't forget to take the Viking tour on the amphibious vehicles, a great laugh and you really see lots of sites around Dublin and the staff are a great laugh and at the same time very knowledgable of local history.",4,2014,09,11
204,Nice Hotel-City Center,The Fitzwilliam Hotel is right in the city center of Dublin-an easy walk to good shopping and restaurants.  City tour buses are right across the square.  The hotel is well appointed and the rooms are very nice.  The restaurant and bar area serves good food in a pleasant atmosphere.  Staff is very responsive to any concerns and the concierge service is outstanding.,4,2014,09,11
204,Excellent hotel,"The four of us have stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel in two adjacent rooms. In short the experience is great. The excellent location is a good starting point as it provides easy walking access to many of the Dublin's attractions. Next is the concierge. Describing them as helpful would be an under estimation. Genuine interest in our preference, top notch recommendations, and of course making reservations. I just wish having this everywhere. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, equipped with all kinds of goodies, large window seat, CD player, speakers in the bathroom, fancy phone, and alike. Umbrellas are provided both in the room and the hotel's door. Useful indeed. Last but not least is breakfast. It may be somewhat expensive however it is an absolute must, at least once. Buffet style with reasonable selection is the obvious part. Hot dishes like eggs are prepared to your order and are excellent. No doubt I would like to come back.",5,2014,09,09
204,"Definitely five star - ""This hotel was a great find"".","This hotel is an oasis of warmth, comfort with great hospitality where you can indulge in stylish surrounds.  We stayed here last weekend and have stayed here a few times ,  When you arrive you are met with such friendly welcoming staff from the concierge who park your car to the lovely friendly professionally Brid , Victoria and Jonathan to name just a few .... We made our booking with Jennifer in reservations - she was so friendly and helpful  and allocated us such a nice room with a balcony just because from previous notes she knew we loved this room. This is good customer relations . The room is so luxurious and  peaceful ensuring a good night sleep.
   Breakfast is a feast traditional table service for the hot food is becoming a rarity in Ireland , great to see it still exists here, what a choice of hot food as well as cold - Gastronomic delight food fit a King , Dinner was equally nice , good dining experience with warm and friendly service. Delicious gourmet food made with the finest local ingredients. 
  Overall Management and staff thank you all - its the ultimate destination in Dublin , I'm sure going back. . .",5,2014,09,09
204,Disappointing not 5 star,"Went for a night away with my mam shopping and for dinner. When we arrived we were allocated room 625. Had to get a lift to the 5th floor and then up some stairs and wall through a few corridors to even get to the room. On arrival we were disappointed with the size of the room for the star and price. Nice bathrooms but rooms an average 4 star standard. The noise in the room was unbearable from an aircon unit from the shopping centre next door which hummed and broke into rattling every few minutes. The only solution they had was to move us because the security in the shopping centre didn't know how to turn it off!! 
The new room was of the same standard but at least both taps worked in this room even of the main bathroom mirror was damaged in three of the four corners. 
We had breakfast the next morning in citron restaurant. We were politely shown to our seat and explained the process. But nobody came back to take our order we approached one of the waitrons to order. We got the food but the tea coffee never arrived so we had to ask again. There were 2 guys in suits maybe a host and a manager doing all the work with 4 other employees leaning against a wall enjoying each others company. This hotel is definitely missing the personal touch. Nobody was friendly or quality checked us at any stage. We were looking forward to a relaxing break but all we got was stress having to ask and chase everything instead of being looked after in a luxury hotel. Would not recommend a stay there are much better 4 star hotels in the area. ",2,2014,09,07
204,Don't use the safe!,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for three nights in September 2014.  The hotel location is perfect for seeing Dublin's sights.  The concierge was spot on with their restaurant recommendations and their reservations were helpful.  
We arrived on a Saturday morning, and despite having requested an early check-in, no rooms were available until around 2pm.  The staff was extremely apologetic and took care of our bar bill while we waited, which was a nice gesture.  We paid for a ""deluxe"" room which was quite large and had balcony overlooking St. Stephens Green.  The room was in good condition and seemed well cared-for.  
We immediately had two issues - the in-room safe was inoperable and the TV didn't work.  Both items were addressed while we were out sight-seeing.  On the evening before we were to depart we discovered that the safe was again inoperable, but this time with our passports and extra cash and credit cards inside.  The manager on duty was unable to open the safe and informed us that we would have to wait until the maintenance man arrived the next morning to open the safe.  The next morning, after 45 minutes of drilling and hacking at the safe, the maintenance man took the unopened safe from the room and said he'd leave the contents with the front desk.  The whole affair left us to check out a few hours late without much of an apology or acknowledgement from the staff on hand.  Luckily we weren't catching a flight that day, but it did delay the next leg of our trip.",3,2014,09,06
204,Anniversary ignored!,"We booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel (having stayed there many years previously for my birthday weekend) to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary.  I mentioned this on the online reservation form  (Booking.com) as our stay was on the day of our anniversary itself.  I emailed the concierge about 5 days beforehand to ask if he could suggest a good Italian or Asian restaurant for our 10th wedding anniversary dinner.  He made a few suggestions including the hotel restaurant, but we chose another one, which he made a reservation with.  I also emailed a day or two later to ask if he would make a lunch reservation with another restaurant for the day after our stay, for us to meet up with friends.  He did this for us also.  So far so good.  I was impressed with customer service as we hadn't even got there yet.  

When we checked in the receptionist asked if we were staying that night for any particular reason.  Obviously the fact that we mentioned on our booking form and also in correspondence with the concierge that it was our 10th wedding anniversary that day, had not been passed on to reception.  It wasn't as if we had expected a fanfare, but having stayed last year for our wedding anniversary at Lough Eske and having been wished a Happy Anniversary on check in, and had a slice of cake left in our room, and also again at the bar, I had assumed that this was pretty standard in a 5 star hotel.  Apparently not!  Our anniversary was not marked in any way by this hotel.

Anyway, the hotel carpark was a nightmare to find with poor signage, so we rang the hotel and having followed the concierge(?)'s instructions, managed to miss it altogether. the road in front of the hotel is blocked off with bollards, as the trams (Luas) go to and from there.  The hotel car park is below the hotel and the entrance to it is accessed from behind the hotel.  The entrance is right next to the St Stephen's Green Shopping Centre Car Park entrance.  The sign for it needs to be made larger and placed in a more obvious place, and be warned the parking in there is pretty tight!

Our room was nice, overlooking St Stephens Green as requested (and paid for!) but seemed to be smaller than the room that we had stayed in last time (which had overlooked the internal courtyard garden), with a much smaller window so it was little darker too.  The dark wood of the furniture didn't help to lighten up the space, which also made it feel smaller.  It wasn't cramped, but was a much smaller room than the 4 poster deluxe garden view rooms at Lough Eske, and the room we stayed in previously in the Shelbourne which had both cost much less than this room.  We realise that city hotels and country hotels have differing space issues but we still expected a little more space for the cost of the room.  The 4 poster bed took up much of the room.  The room was nice, but it is obviously the location and view that puts the price up.

The bathroom was good.  It was well laid out and a decent size, with a freestanding bath and a separate walk in shower cubicle, and there were plenty of toiletries and towels for 2 people.  The music centre was a nice touch too, with music piped into the bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable, and we had a great nights sleep.  We had anticipated that being at the front of the hotel there might be a lot of noise from outside, but as the area at the front is pedestrianised, and with two separate layers of windows (one of which slides across for air), we were not disturbed by any partying on the street below.  The air con in the room was fine - not too noisy!

We like a good hotel bar, but we weren't tempted to have a drink in this one.  The bar is beyond reception, towards the back of the hotel.  It didn't look particularly inviting.  The style and layout of the wooden tables and chairs were very utilitarian looking, like a breakfast room.  No deep cosy armchairs or sofas in this hotel bar so just not my cup of tea. Reception seating looked a little more inviting but was not connected to the bar in any way, so I am not sure whether you can order a drink to this area.  The cigar bar/club next door, which may or may not belong to the hotel (we weren't sure as it appeared to be totally separate, with only an entrance from the street, but I think the hotel might have rooms above it?) was heaving when we returned to the hotel at about midnight (on a Saturday night), so it must be very popular.  

The hotel restaurants (of which there are 2) cannot be seen from reception, although you can see waiters heads if you look up to the level above the bar.  Having eaten in one of them when we had stayed a few years ago, we were in no rush to go back as Dublin has so many brilliant restaurants to try ...  On that occasion dinner had been included in the weekend rate that we got for our room, and we remember that it was ok, but not amazing, so we weren't tempted to give it another go.

Our room rate did not include breakfast so we didn't bother having any.  Having had a pretty late night, and with lunch booked for 12, we had a lie in, and checked out just before 12.  We were allowed to leave our car in the carpark whilst we had lunch, at no extra cost (as parking was included in our room rate).

Before we left we helped ourselves to a glass of iced water in the seated area to the right of reception, which was refreshing.  Having stayed at the Croke Park Hotel 3 months previously, and been given bottled water for our journey, this seems to be standard practice in hotels now in Dublin.  Not quite as impressive as the free handmade cookies offered at reception in the Shelbourne though, but you can't have everything!?

Overall I would describe this hotel as a functional, business-like hotel rather than a romantic setting.  I didn't see any children whilst there, and can't imagine taking our kids to stay here either.  As a base, it's location is very good as it is opposite the park, next to a huge indoor shopping arcade, just a stones throw from Grafton Street with its shops, close to many theatres, restaurants and bars, and within walking distance to most attractions or places you might want to visit.  There is something a little utilitarian and uninviting about the hotel itself though.  

The hotel staff at reception and particularly the concierge were friendly and helpful, but I just felt that there are no frills about this hotel.  That's why I have given it 3 stars, as apart from location it feels just average!  At the price I would expect more from it.  We felt that the Shelbourne was much better value for money, and had much more atmosphere.

And it would have been nice to have been greeted with a ""Happy Anniversary"" when we checked in (or indeed at any time).  We didn't expect a red carpet reception, or a free upgrade to a suite or anything, but having mentioned it so many times prior to arriving, it was a little disappointing that our very special occasion was not acknowledged at all.  After all, we chose to spend it here, and not somewhere else.  It made a difference to our enjoyment of staying here as I felt like we were just another number to them, which all being said and done is exactly all we are to such a large established hotel.  Some hotels realise the importance of special occasions, and mark it is some little way, and others don't.  This one didn't for us.  It's the little things that can really count, and make a guest feel special, and wishing us a happy anniversary without prompting would have cost nothing at all but would have made such a difference.  This stay was our second special occasion which the hotel didn't bother to acknowledge, so we won't give it a third chance.  There are so many hotels to choose from in Dublin ...

Next time we decide to splurge for a special occasion in Dublin, we will possibly try out the Westbury ...  As unfortunately I can't see us returning to the Fitzwilliam in a hurry.",3,2014,09,06
204,Great location and service,Staff at the hotel are welcoming and seem genuinely interested. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony (and a balcony heater) and view over St Stephen's Green  which really enhanced our stay. The bathroom was enormous and the room and bed comfortable . The concierge was helpful with appropriate restaurant recommendations and bookings. The location is brilliant. It doesn't look much from the outside and doesn't have Georgian charm but were ally enjoyed our stay and would recommend it.,5,2014,09,04
204,"Fantastic stay, lovely details.","Our family of 4 spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel to wrap up our Ireland trip. 

We were greeted warmly and quickly shown to our rooms, (we had 2 adjacent rooms). The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. Our rooms were spotless with modern amenities and plenty of space to relax. 

Here are some of the details that I particularly loved.

The large window seat, The tea and coffee ""drawer"" (complete with tea pot, hot pot, various selection of coffee and tea and china cups) Another nook had a CD player with a note to ask for a cd to borrow from the front desk (speakers in room and in the bathroom!) Throw pillows and small blanket on the bed, umbrellas to borrow (both in the room, and by the front door of the hotel). I fell in love with the HUGE bathtub and shower- I've never seen anything this size in Europe. 

Breakfast was divine- served in their restaurant buffet style but with the addition of a made to order hot breakfast that we ordered from the menu. At the buffet, we were able to pick from mixed cold cuts and cheeses, various breakfast breads, smoothies, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, juices etc. Our server took our hot order (pancakes, french toast, omelets, full irish breakfast were some of the offerings) and also brought us hot toast and hot drinks. It was amazing! 

Our second morning we had room service, and our food was free since we had a package that included breakfast- we just had to pay the service charge to have it brought to our room. Amazing! 

We had a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again when we return to Dublin!",5,2014,09,03
204,Impressive First Stay,"This was the beginning of our touring Ireland.  We were greeted warmly and attended to professionally.  Our check in was quick and we were set off to our room which was clean and fresh.  The concierge team was always helpful and informative. We enjoyed eating on the Mezzanine and had fresh food choices each day from both the buffet and the menu.  One morning I left my handbag behind and a lovely gal came to our room to return it.  Had she not everything important to me would have been lost, I thank her again.  We also used one of the umbrellas that is located near the door and nearly 2 weeks later I returned it and they were so gracious that we had come back with it.  We had a nice stay here and would recommend it to anyone.",4,2014,09,02
204,We should have booked here first!,"We had a chance to spend two nights away from our kids and had (mistakenly) decided to stay somewhere else the first night and the Fitzwilliam the second.  

We are kicking ourselves that we did not spend both nights in the Fitzwilliam.  OK, the rooms and general surrounding are showing signs of wear and tear, the rooms are also tight, but the view and location is absolutely superb.  It does not end there either!

We had been asked if our stay was a special occasion, it happened to be an anniversary and we were given a voucher for two free cocktails.  The room that we were given was on the 4th floor, had a balcony and great view of Stephen's green.  That night - having eaten earlier in Dublin - we found ourselves at the bar (enjoying the cocktails - which were delicious, made and extremely well presented) but could not decide on anything from the bar-food menu.  The menu was great but I just felt like a BLT or club sandwhich.  The barman checked with the kitchen and without any quibble they delivered a club with chips (for me) and chicken wings for my wife.  The Club was absolutely delicious.  Few places make a good club sandwhich (the old Berkley Court Hotel in its prime was one) but this was a very very close second - and streets ahead of anything I have had elsewhere.  The price was also very reasonable (€10) which we found out on check out.  

We retired to our room, which was very comfortable and had breakfast the next morning.  Breakfast has a real WOW factor.  From the delicious smoothies (served in cool small bottles), selection of fruit (pre-served for you in small glass cups), and the usual selection of cereals, pastries, etc.  But the GREAT thing about breakfast is that they make hot food to order.  It is worth going to this restaurant for breakfast even if you don't stay overnight. 

The breakfast to order is absolutely delicious and I hate to admit that we pigged out!  

The waiting staff (two people) worked flat out, had a great attitude and made the experience very very enjoyable.  A really nice touch also is that the food and services manager discretely checked in on almost every table to make sure that all was OK.

Now for the best bit.  Because our baby was sleeping late the hotel agreed to a late check out (1pm).  From about 10.30 to 12.30 we sat on the balcony looking down at the world below.  We had coffees and pain au chocolat and - it was so warm - we were sunbathing - I had shorts and my wife had a bikini.  Crazy but true!

If you are thinking of booking this Hotel, go for it.  Great food, nice rooms, great view, super location, good service, good, good, good....",4,2014,09,02
204,3 annual visits to The Fitz. ,"I have visited The Fitzwillam for the past 3 years for 3-5 days. The check-in process is quick and orderly with personal care to your current agenda. Rich colors welcome you to fireplaces and a lovely sitting area. Equipped with umbrellas and news papers. Location is easy to find and central to everything from shopping to breweries. 

After check-in I ventured into the hotel bar. Met with gentlemen who could speak multiple languages, fluently. Some incredible drink and food suggestion were made. Not only for the hotel itself. But a few signature bars within 10 minutes walk. Great craic with Tomas and Alex. Keeping my glass full and spirits high. Professional and quick with attention to detail. The bar itself is a huge selection of spirits, wine and Irish beers. Large bar area and plenty of intimate booths or high tops for drinking groups. Either way, the service is impressive.

Come check out the Fitz for a drink. If considering to book, it's top quality with excellent rooms and service. A short walk away from everything.

204,Wonderful Place to Stay,"Stayed there for work and had a wonderful experience. Friendly service, comfy rooms, and great location. Really enjoyed the personal touches in the room and great breakfast was offered in the morning. 
      ",5,2014,08,30
204,Fun decor but erratic service,"Great location on the Green with excellent concierge service.  However, since they bill as 5 star they should step up in all areas.  The 'new' tea was absolutely scrumptious but the service was a bit dismal; over thirty minutes after the tea was served to have the food tray delivered to the table.  Then we went to the bar late night for an Irish coffee and the server said they were out of cream.  Really, in Ireland??  Not to be deterred, we called room service and had two yummy Irish coffees delivered to room.",4,2014,08,30
204,Very nice hotel with great service,"We recently stayed three nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The service is pretty top notch. We were greeted by very friendly staff at our arrival and felt immediately welcome. The bed was nice and comfortable, and the bathroom was nice. The rest of the hotel is also very nicely decorated and everything looks fairly new. The location is also hard to complain about as the hotel is right next to St Stephen's Green.

The first morning though we were awoken by really loud noises coming from the pipes of the room next door where somebody was showering – so loud that we both woke up startled and wondering what was going on. When we confronted the staff with it later that morning though they acted immediately and moved us to another room within 30 minutes, and even upgraded us to a slightly bigger room. We had no noise issues in the new room.

Although there is free wifi, the quality is pretty poor. It was not really useful for anything else than e-mail (and in the first room it barely worked).",4,2014,08,25
204,A Great Location in Dublin:,"Spent a few days in the glorious city of Dublin. We stayed at the glorious Fitzwilliam Hotel. Nothing was too much and we were made to feel very welcomed with the usual Irish spirit and hospitality. 

The Hotel is located on St Stephens Green, yes, you are in the hub of Tourist area but as a visitor to the city for a few days, it was perfect to visit the many attractions and great restaurants and bars in the area, only a short walking distant to all that you could possibly need. 

The hotel interior was designed and curated by Sir Terrance Conran and is spectacular throughout. The rooms are spacious and thoroughly comfortable offering free wifi on premises. 

We didn't eat in the restaurant but ordered breakfast in bed which was lovely. The concierge was really helpful and nothing was a problem. Free chilled water and apples (nice touch) for consumption. The bathroom was particularly comfortable, great shower and soft hotel towels. 

I would recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It's a great place, located right next to the shopping and other stand out hotels. 

Thanks very much",5,2014,08,25
204,VERY DISAPPOINTING,Having previously stayed in this hotel I could not recommend it enough - fantastic room . However this time the room was more expensive and tiny. I was told the hotel was fully booked but then told they would look and see if they could do something - then nothing . I booked well in advance ( 4 months )  to Thorntons Restaurant for the Tasting Menu only to be telephoned the day before to say we had to be away from our table for 9pm from a 7pm booking for a tasting menu which has at least 5 courses. This was a very much looked forward to trip for a 40th birthday and was very disappointing.,2,2014,08,25
204,Fantastic!,"This is the best hotel in Dublin that we have stayed at. We have previously stayed at the Merrion & The Gresham and we found this hotel to be much better.
It has the perfect location right at the top of Grafton St and next to Stephens Green Shopping Mall - opposite is Stephens Green Park. It is a short walk to most attractions.

Our room was small but lovely - we had a view of the roof garden and as we were at the back of the hotel it was very quiet.

Breakfast was amazing - great selection of anything you'd want attractively presented and freshly cooked to order.

The staff were very welcoming & friendly. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they were very keen to help.

We had a very relaxing stay & will certainly be back.",5,2014,08,22
204,2Night Stay,"This Hotel is situated right in the centre of Dublin,within walking distance of Trinity College, Grafton Street , You can catch the open top City Tour Bus just round the corner by St Stephens Park.
We were very impressed with the food in the Citron Restaurant. If you book in on the Stacation Deal you receive a complimentary dinner .
The staff were efficient & friendly. Would stay again & recommend.",4,2014,08,22
204,The Best in Dublin,"Booked via hotel website then rang to request a room on the top floor with balcony (not the penthouse suite) facing St. Stephen's Green park. 

Excellent service throughout.  Friendly staff. Room is small but tastefully decorated with step to climb out onto balcony.  Large well designed bathroom also with balcony access. Great heater on balcony for cool nights.

Lovely treats sent to room within minutes of checking in. Turn down service every evening. Had breakfast in bed every day there and menu was great. Room has cupboards,  umbrellas, robes, slippers, hairdryer,  iron and ironing board, complimentary water X 2 daily, complimentary newspaper daily, tea/coffee making  facilities,  shampoos/shower gels, minibar, safe, CO player and TV! Everything basically.  Just brilliant.  

EXCELLENT LOCATION at the top of Grafton Street and adjacent to St.  Stephen's Green shopping centre.  Shopping is brilliant here - something for everyone. Westbury Hotel on Grafton Street is also nice but I prefer this modern chic hotel, especially if you can get balcony room to peer out over Dublin City. 

Will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,08,21
204,Great Location and Service,"This is our first trip to Dublin..so happy to have booked our room at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Located right in the heart of a lively neighborhood on Grafton Street, across the street from St. Stephen's Park, Trinity College, and many other worthy visitor sites.  Many restaurants, pubs, and stores are only a few steps away from the hotel.  

Service is warm and friendly..excellent breakfast, will definitely return..",5,2014,08,20
204,Excellent service,Nice hotel in a great location.  Staff across the board provided excellent service and attention.  Being in a new city for a short time the concierge desk could not have been more helpful in providing information and making arrangements.,5,2014,08,18
204,everything was perfect and just a step away from everything..,"What a great way to start and finish our vacation in beautiful Ireland. After literally driving the wild atlantic  we came back tired yet looking forward ""to coming home"", Joanna at the reception remembered us from our first day of our vacation- her warmth and help was just fantastic! The hotel rooms AND bathrooms  are stylish with a zest in them that makes even the wet weather outside  insignificant. The hotel is so centrally located we just had the best time jumping in and out of the city. 
This is the place to be if you are staying in Dublin.. Great job !",5,2014,08,17
204,Excellent hotel,"My daughter and I stayed 3 nights and enjoyed our stay very much. The staff was very friendly, especially the concierges. They made us two ""ladies"" feel welcome and cared for!
The room was very nice, and clean, with comfortable beds and a very nice bathroom. The restaurant had very good food and the waiters were friendly and polite.
The hotel is ideally located for a stay in the city. I can recomend it for anyone staying in Dublin.",5,2014,08,17
204,Outstanding Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel was part of a package we booked with Costco and we are so happy we chose the hotel over the other options.  The hotel was absolutely beautiful and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We had a beautiful room that looked out to the main street.  The location was wonderful and close to everything we needed.  Very easy to get around.  We booked the hop on hop off bus tour online before going to Dublin, next time we would just wait and do it from hotel.  The concierge (along withers of staff) were very helpful.  We got an excellent recommendation for dinner the first night and then they were always willing to help with other questions we had. We wanted to do the Guinness tour and the concierge did that for us at the hotel and printed out our tickets.  The breakfast at hotel was great.  The presentation was super nice.  Breakfast consisted of the usual hot and cold items, eggs, Danish, fruit, juices, coffees, tea, juices, cereals, etc.  You could get omelets as well along with bacon, sausage and other meats.  The morning we left was prior to breakfast and they packed us to go bags with fruit, Danish and water.  Nice touch!  The hotel is close to all the shopping area--perfect location!  I would recommend this to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2014,08,16
204,lovely,"We stayed 6 days recently and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is grand and the room was spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful each and every time we spoke with them, which was every time we came in or out the doors. The concierge staff was excellent, right on the mark with reservations and taxis whenever we needed, and with a smile every time too. The only glitch was when we first checked in, we had requested an accessible room and when we arrived the bath had a deep tub that I was unable to use. I had to pay for an upgrade to get a shower, although they did give us a deal for it. An annoyance, but hardly a deal breaker. The location was great, close to most attractions and St Stephens' Green was a wonderful surprise, a quiet retreat just across the street. We would love to go back already, and for a longer stay too.",5,2014,08,15
204,Ireland Golf trip,The staff is very outgoing and helpful especially the concierge/valet folks. Tony was a standout and all went out of their way to make us feel welcome on our first trip to Ireland. The hotel rooms were very nice as was the restaurant. I highly recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel to all visitors. Great location as well.,5,2014,08,14
204,Concierge service at Fitzwilliam Hotel,"On our recent trip to Dublin we had the good fortune to meet Victor at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. On our first night in a new city we asked  for advice and dinner suggestions. He was not only so gracious in talking to us and answering all of our touristy questions, he suggested a fabulous restaurant, made our reservation and gave us directions. We went back the next day to thank him and he gave us a few more restaurant suggestions and made another reservation. We enjoyed talking with him and appreciated his great dinner ideas. How nice to meet someone who enjoys his job and does it so well!",4,2014,08,12
204,Bobcohen,"Wonderful hotel. Wonderful experience. Patrick,the concierge was awesome from start to finish. Highly recommend. The room was very nice, the breakfasts were delicious, and the location was perfect. Great choice.",5,2014,08,11
204,"Great hotel,  excellent value, perfectly placed!","We got a really good rate for this hotel by searching different sites.  We know Dublin quite well and knew that the Fitzwilliam is right in the centre where we wanted to be.  We were not disappointed, the hotel was welcoming from the start and didn't disappoint throughout our four day stay.   We received a upgrade on our room which was delightful and had everything we needed.  The other four rooms allocated to other members of our party were equally good.  We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis so didn't experience the restaurant in the evening, however the food on offer for breakfast was definitely five star as were the very attentive staff.  Thank you Fitzwilliam for a great stay - would definitely consider returning.",5,2014,08,11
204,A very enjoyable stay at the Fitzwilliam,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam and thoroughly enjoyed it. We were met with a friendly welcome and after checking us in the receptionist showed us to our room and explained all to us. The room itself was comfortable, spacious and tastefully decorated. We ate lunch in the hotel bar and once again we were met with very friendly and accommodating staff. The food was delicious and also very reasonable. The concierge couldn't have been any more accommodating and helpful when we needed our phones charged but had forgotten our charger. Breakfast was outstanding, fresh and tasty foods and once again very friendly staff who made sure we were being very well seen to. We cannot rate the Fitzwilliam high enough, it is an outstanding hotel and the location and friendliness of the staff along with the quality of service would definitely encourage us to recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a break away in Dublin. Many many thanks to all in the Fitzwilliam, we look forward to returning again in the future and keep up the fantastic work.",5,2014,08,08
204,Comfortable and centrally located,"We spent 7 nights at the Fitzwiliam on a business trip. My room was a courtyard garden-facing room on the 5th floor. Our check in was quick but the person checking us in early in the morning merely had us complete the necessary forms and then handed us our keys. No assistance offered proactively at all. We had to ask him if there was someone to help take up our luggage given that one of us was headed to a room on the 6th floor (only accessible by stairs from the 5th floor!). The room was comfortable but felt small and apart from the work chair at the desk, the only other seating was a window panel with two cushions which were actually not that comfortable to do much with. The space was quiet except for when my neighbors were showering in which case the extremely loud sound of water in the pipes was audible and disturbing. Breakfast options were diverse but the service was hit or miss. Some mornings the staff were attentive and responsive and other days it felt like no one was responsible for our table. We had to stop random servers to ask them for something we needed. The location of the hotel cannot be beat really and I hope that the hotel can address some of these short comings to really achieve its full potential.",4,2014,08,08
204,Great hotel and staff. Will return.,"We love this hotel. A great place to base yourself with easy access to everything. A real treat. Staff are very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge; nothing was a problem. We will definitely return. ",5,2014,08,08
204,Great stay,"My fiancée and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel 1-3 August. This was our first time staying and we found the staff both friendly and approachable. We stayed in an executive suite which was spacious and well equipped with mini bar, tea/coffee and ironing facilities. The room was made every day and clean towels supplied. Very central to the busy City centre and within easy walking distance to both shops and bars/restaurants. Thoroughly recommend anyone to stay and have an enjoyable stay",5,2014,08,07
204,Excellent.,"We arrived in Dublin early but there was no hesitation from the staff and they allowed us to check in. The room was immaculate, the bed was very comfortable, Stephen's Green is literally on your door step, the shops are 5 minutes away and most of the main tourist attractions are 10 mins away. I cannot fault this hotel at all!! ",5,2014,08,07
204,Great stay at a wonderful hotel!!,"My husband and I spent a week at the Fitzwilliam and could not have been happier. Beautiful décor, spotlessly clean and in a perfect location. The food was outstanding and there were many special little touches--fresh orchids in the room, big fluffy bathrobes, free sparkling water.  But what really makes the Fitzwilliam stand out is the service. Every single person--from front desk staff to concierge to doorman--went out of their way to make our stay special. Thanks to Tony and Patrick, we saw some of the most beautiful sights in the area (and never got lost). Thanks to Viktor, Martin and Jorkka, we had some of the most memorable meals of our lives. And although the place was bustling with activity, the staff always took the time to assist us. We hated to leave--we will definitely be back!",5,2014,08,05
204,Great to return three years later to see the rooms have been renovated,Great rooms very comfortable bed in large room. Free wifi   Good size bathroom a good four to five star hotel. Great position also very close to everything. Good bar with food. Conceirge were excellent and very funny.,5,2014,08,04
204,Best hotel in Dublin,"My husband and I spent 5 nights at Fitzwilliam Hotel.   It is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in during our trip to Scotland and Ireland.  The rooms are well appointed, and look exactly as shown in the pictures.  The food was great.  The service at the hotel is second to none, from the front desk staff, to waiters and waitresses, to the concierges.  If we are ever back in Dublin, we will definitely stay at Fitzwilliam hotel again.",5,2014,08,04
204,One of the best,"I stayed here earlier this year and can say it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.

The rooms are spotlessly clean, the staff are attentive and the location is brilliant, right outside St Stephens Green. 
I informed the hotel I would be proposing to my partner, they made an extra effort and when we returned to the room there was champagne and cake waiting for us. 

Overall an excellent elite hotel and I will be returning.

Thanks again.",5,2014,08,04

204,fitzwilliam hotel holiday,Hi I'm Ruairi and I'm 7 but I'm  turning 8 in 24 days.I went to the fitzwilliam hotel on the 31'st of July .It took 1 hour and when we got there the butler brought our bags to our room. We checked in and we had to wait for our room to get ready. So we went to a cafe on Grafton Street. There were a lot of buskers on Grafton Street. When we went to the hotel we went to our room. It was room 304 on the third floor. The butler had hung up our coats. He left a note saying to have a nice time and left cookies for us. The room had a very big bed and a sofabed. There was music in the bathroom! When my mummy went in the bath she didn't realise it was going to be very deep and she said she almost drowned! There were bathrobes and slippers and you could see the train going to Sandyford out of the window as well as the park and shops. In the hotel there was a bar and a restaurant. The bar man made me a cocktail and the flavours were orange and pineapple. The hotel was very fancy and I enjoyed it. ,5,2014,08,01
204,Excellent service,"Modern hotel, quiet, fast free wifi, superb location in the middle of the city centre overlooking St. Stephen's Green. Service was of the highest quality and very accommodating. Highly recommended hotel.",5,2014,07,31
204,over the top service,"location is fabulous-centrally located near grafton street shopping and on st stephens square; rooms are very modern, well maintained and nicely furnished (best bath water pressure ever); and staff is unbelievably accommodating- from front door greeting to check out and everyone in between!

204,The place to stay in Dublin,"Letter written to General Manager of this hotel:

Dear Mr. O'connell.
 
Although I'm not checking out until tomorrow morning, I wanted to thank you and commend your staff for such an outstanding stay.  From our check in on Tuesday afternoon through the day today, it has been a first rate experience.  
 
My wife and I have been on an 18 day golf holiday in Scotland and Ireland.  The dinner we had at Citron last evening was the best we have had in both taste, texture, presentation and service in the past two weeks.  I would like to especially thank the two young women who served us (Migle and ?).  And this morning, we expressed our thanks to Kevin and he was most courteous in our exchange.  And the two gentlemen you had at the concierge desk, Tony and Jakko (I think) were exceptional as well.
 
Congratulations on having such a superb, well trained and attentive staff.
 
Steve
 
P.S. I have copied our travel agent as well on this email.",5,2014,07,29
204,Outstanding Service,"great location in the middle of the city within minutes to the busy streets but away from the noisy parts (if one wants to be) & the service of the hotel staff could not be better. we had a fantastic weekend in Dublin & thanks to the Concierge team one of the best dinners in years! looking forward to our next visit.
      ",5,2014,07,24
204,Amazing Hotel,"This is a very nice and extremely beautiful hotel and the location can’t be beat.  I took the bus from Dublin Airport, and I got of at Trinity College.  It was about a ten-minute walk down Grafton Street south towards St. Stephen’s Square, and because it was a nice day everyone was out on the streets.  I passed many shops and restaurants along the way, so I knew I had places to go that were nearby.

The lobby of the hotel is beautiful.  There was a nice roaring fire with comfortable couches in the front, the concierge desk by the elevators, and the front desk back by the bar.  The hotel staff was extremely friendly.  The doormen always smiled and said hello when I walked in and out of the hotel, and the front desk staff always went above and beyond.  I asked for dinner recommendations for later that night, and they were able to get us one at a very nice restaurant at a reasonable time.

The rooms are decorated very nicely.  We had a nice view of St. Stephen’s Square with large windows.  There were purple accents everywhere, which made the room modern, yet classic.  The bed was comfortable, there was a small sitting area next to the desk, there was music playing when we walked in, and the bathroom had a green tub in it.  My only complaint is that the shower was a bit small to move around, but the toiletries were amazing.

We had drinks at the bar before dinnertime, and the bartender was very friendly.  Of course we had beers, but there were a lot to choose from.  Later on in the evening, around 1:00AM, the bar was still open, even though there were two other people there.  He gladly served us and chatted.  We decided to move by the fireplaces and sit on the couches by the fire, which was very comfortable.  It was a bit annoying that the front doors were locked and the only way to get in was to ring the doorbell.  But at least we know the place is secure.

Overall, the hotel had a friendly staff and great location.  We definitely recommend staying here during your next trip to Dublin.",5,2014,07,23
204,"Back room, weak view & wifi signal.","Rooms are decent & comfortable. Nice as long as you don't look too close. If you do happen to look close, you will notice shoddy workmanship. As if the contractor got tired 3/4 of the way through installing the ___________ and just slapped the rest together as quickly as possible. I noticed this a lot in Dublin, so maybe that's just the norm. Wifi is spotty, at least in the back of the hotel. Our view was a small garden area and offices across from us, the occupants of which could see into our room.

If you can afford it, and don't mind street noise, I would strongly recommend a room facing St. Stephen's Green. The park and street are bustling with activity and would make for excellent people watching from your room.",3,2014,07,23
204,"Central Hotel, lovely rooms but lacks atmosphere","We stayed here while in Dublin and found the location to be excellent, a very short walk to Grafton Street. All staff were courteous and friendly and the rooms were excellent. Car parking was extra though we were able to leave the car in the space late into the next day which was much appreciated. 

I normally like to read the paper and lounge in the lobby or bar area but found them to be without atmosphere and the bar area was quite dark, even during the day.

We did enjoy our stay however.",3,2014,07,21
204,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel ""Fitz""","My wife & I were in Ireland for 12 days, & stayed in 5 different hotels. The Fitzwilliam was the last place we stayed in on our final night in Ireland. From the time we pulled up in our rental car, we were warmly greeted by a doorman who helped me relax after our harrowing drive from Waterford! The check in process was easy, & our room, 526 was wonderful: modern furnishings, comfortable bed, clean bathroom, & a nice view of the back courtyard which also faced an office building which was pretty cool architecturally. The hotel location is just excellent, as straight out the front door is St. Stephens Green, & if you go left out of the hotel, you hit Grafton Street with all the shops, restaurants, street performers, & so on. Also, if you walk on Grafton St, you are minutes away from Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, & would w/o a doubt book here when we return to Dublin. We recommend it!!",5,2014,07,21
204,Fantastic,"Fantastic hotel..Could not get anythink better. Rooms out of this world....Staff more than helpfull. In great location, close to the most wonderfull bars. Would recommend to all. Will definitely vist this hotel again. Just love Dublin......",5,2014,07,20
204,Very pleasant experience,"From the moment we arrived till the moment we left we had first class treatment. The lovely lady who showed us to our room gave us complimentary cocktails as it was our anniversary. Room service was unbelievably fast. The service in the bar was of a high standard and the food we had in the bar was very tasty. Our car was looked after so there was no worry of having to pay a high price for parking in Dublin. 
When we arrived back to our hotel that night, there was an Easter egg on our bed along with 2 chocolates and a note wishes us a ""Happy Easter"" from all at the Fitzwilliam hotel. We had a very pleasant experience that was created by the efficient staff. 
We would recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel to anyone who is visiting Dublin. ",5,2014,07,20
204,"Boutique, Great Service and Location","The hotel is well located across from St Stephen’s green, a nice inner city park. The Grafton street shopping area and its great side streets full of original pubs is just at the hotel’s door. It is a 10 minute walk to Trinity College, and 15 minutes to the river. The décor is muted funky purple and beige giving the hotel an edge over some of the more traditional top end offerings in Dublin.
The rooms are situated around an inner garden courtyard. Some rooms face St Stephen’s Green, but these are noisier. Try for a room above the garden floor as the view of the ornamental garden is lost as seen from higher floors. 
We stayed in a larger room with fold out couch. Our initial booking was a signature queen, and with an extra child’s bed was inadequate in size, necessitating an upgrade.
The room was nicely decorated with a minimalistic four poster bed, great mattress and bedding, nice décor and room tones with purple accents and a pleasant window box looking out over the courtyard garden. The bathroom was spacious, and the shower over bath with shower curtain was only a mild annoyance. The room air conditioner was excellent. A separate unit that actually had an influence on the air temperature, a rare thing indeed in Europe, but much appreciated on a warm humid day.
The service was excellent. The lovely Irish disposition of the staff was added to with a professionalism that saw them try to satisfy every guest need. 
The hotel gym was unfortunately a token appalling effort. The elliptical trainer was a cheap model that had not been serviced, one treadmill and one bike in a small room with poor air-conditioner and a TV remote with no batteries. Two in the gym would have been a crowd. Exercise is clearly not a priority for this hotel.
A nice bar, breakfast and dinner casual restaurant and Michelin starred fine diner were not sampled.
Try the Pig’s Ear and Winding Stair for a great Modern Irish feed. 
This hotel is boutique, with great service and in a great location in a great capital city.",5,2014,07,19
204,The Best of the Best,"Took a chance on this hotel and it turned out to be the Best of the Best for our trip to the UK, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.  Looked at locations, hotel reviews, accessibility, transportation, all that we travelers research, and here it was.  Our room, #353, with a balcony overlooking an enclosed garden area, the amenities, room-service, closet space, comfort, all exceptional.
Sent a request to the hotel before our arrival that the duvet on the bed be replaced with a light-weight blanket - all taken care of.  Escorted to our accommodation after an easy, wonderful, friendly check-in.  Could not have been better.  Across from St. Stephen's Green Park, easy walking down Grafton Street with shops, entertainment, bus, tours, and  taxi service, entertainment, St. Patrick's Cathedral and many others not far away, a wonderful place to be.  
From check-in to the wonderful Concierge Jarkko, we could not have asked for anything better.
Only one little flaw, and that got corrected immediately - we did have to ask 3 times for coffee and tea at breakfast served on the 2nd floor on our first morning and had finished our meal before it was delivered.  But a brief conversation with the Maitre d' got that straightened out and for the next 4 mornings there was not a problem.  
The bar/restaurant excellent - food and service.  You will love this hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay at The Fitzwilliam.",5,2014,07,17
204,Perfect Place to Stay,"Just returned from an 8 night stay and loved everything about this hotel (July 2014). It's perfectly located in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to the Gaiety Theater, Grafton St., and  St. Stephen's Green is just across the street. We loved being near all the city excitement, with none of the noise. We were helped tremendously by the gentlemen working the Concierge. Patrick, Vicotr and Marcin were all fabulous. They arranged early morning taxis, a black taxi pick up at the train station in Belfast, a mountain biking adventure in Ballanastoe, and a number of other details that took the stress out of our travels. We loved the thick bath towels and comfy bed and appreciated the chocolates left on our pillow each evening. I usually worry about making recommendations because we travel a lot and have received bad 
advice in the past, but you simply can't go wrong at The Fitzwilliam! Many thanks especially to Patrick and his masterful team!",5,2014,07,17
204,Great Accommodation!,"Great location, staff very friendly and willing to help at all levels.  Beautiful rooms and across the street from St. Stephens Green park.  Grafton St. (shopping district) a block away.  Trams right outside the door to get around town.",4,2014,07,17
204,FANTASTIC STAY,"Just returned from the most amazing weekend break in Dublin. The hotel really is in an amazing spot overlooking St Stephens Green and just round the corner from Grafton St. After looking at reviews we decided to book this hotel for my husbands birthday treat, everything from the beautifully appointed rooms, gorgeous bathrooms with all little amenities and a lovely view over the green to a wonderful Irish breakfast and the most helpful staff. We even had a little birthday message with some chocs for my husband on arrival and chocs on your pillow in the evening. Also must say the umbrellas are a lovely touch too both in your room or in the loby. Didn't eat the hotel apart from breakfast as such an array within Dublin, recommend you try FX Buckleys steakhouse within Temple Bar...superb.
All in all had the most amazing time and this is coming from a very fussy travel agent!!!",5,2014,07,16
204,Outstanding Hotel In the Heart of Dublin.,"On the Fringes of St Sephens Green.  A Lovely Hotel, dripping with Quality. If youre lucky, grab a room with a view over the Green, watch the world go buy.  Grafton and Dawson right there, St Stephens Green just a roll over the Tram Tracks..",5,2014,07,16
204,Nice Hotel in GREAT Location!,"The Fitzwilliam is a nice hotel in the middle of City Centre.  Very close to Grafton Street, and walking distance to many of the major attractions in the city.  We did have to take a taxi out to the Kilmainham Gaol (jail) because it was a little far.  Had a nice signature (standard) room on the courtyard side.  Nice accomodations, but a little different that what I have experienced in the states.  They had 2 twin beds instead of 2 double beds.  No top sheet was provided, and the bath tub went up past my knee, and I'm pretty tall. Very clean and of course, the employees were very friendly and helpful.  As we left, the doorman gave me a big hug goodbye!  

We had a very nice continental breakfast on the mezzanine which was included in our stay.  Great money saver as EVERYTHING in Dublin is expensive.  Had a great time, would highly recommend this location for your next trip in Dublin.",5,2014,07,16
204,Great stay in Dublin,"Having stayed in numerous 3 to 5 star rated hotels over the years, the Fitzwillliam stands out as one of the best. There are only two in my book.

Great location, the most accommodating staff, and extemely clean & comfortable rooms gives this hotel top marks and repeat business in my book. Can hardly wait to return.  ",5,2014,07,16
204,"Location, accomodations, warmth and so much more","We are not too long back in the US from a 2 part stay ( 9 days in all) at the Fitzwilliam ( with a three day run over to London in between) and all I can say is we will be back.  From the first moment we arrived til our departure the staff (actually felt more like family) were warm and oh so helpful.  Our room, overlooking Stephen's Green very comfy with a divine view.  The location is all that and more, but it is really the staff and service provided that makes the Fitzwilliam a standout-- and this from a very particular traveler.....",5,2014,07,13
204,Absolutely Loved the Fitzwilliam,"We stayed for five nights and loved the accommodations, location and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful, especially the concierges who gave us great ideas for local must-dos and must-sees.  We could walk just about everywhere we wanted to go.  They were always glad to see us when we walked through the lobby.",5,2014,07,12
204,The most excellent service,"The hotel is very nice, but what is extraordinary is the staff service and the quality of the bed and pillows!.. I slept delicious!.. The food was also very good and the location it excellent! I truly recommend it!
Would love to go back!",5,2014,07,12
204,Exceptional Property,"Single night stay with wife, first time in Dublin and we could not have selected a better location and property. Steps to central shopping, restaurants, clubs, gardens, Trinity College. Superb location. Greeted by name upon arrival, escorted by reception host to our room, provided all room amenities and called soon after to make sure all was well. Standard size room as is the norm in Europe, well appointed with our room overlooking a roof-top green space in the center of the property. Concierge recommended a great dinner spot a 10 minute walk away. HIghly recommend as a first-time visitor to Dublin with a short stay to see the best sites in central town.",5,2014,07,10
204,Excelent location and comfy room,"We stayed for one night in July and after having been to two other hotels in Dublin we really enjoyed the comfy Fitzwilliam. 
The main point is the location, right by the main attractions for Dublin, I walked out and within 2 minutes I was doing all the shoppings and so on, it is so central and the tram stop is just outside the door.
The room was comfortable though a bit little. All the amenities were good and a complimentary umbrela was quite useful due to typical Dublin weather.
Excelent place for a weekend escape to Dublin or for business!",5,2014,07,10
204,Could not have been better!,"From the moment our group of three golf buddies arrived at the Fitwilliam until the moment we departed we were treated to Irish hospitality that exceeded any expectation.  This was from EVERY hotel staff member we encountered: doormen/concierges, reception, breakfast buffet servers, and the bar staff (special award to bartender, Alex).
The rooms were contemporary, nicely furnished, and clean. Beds very comfortable.
I have no negative comments.
You will not be disappointed if you book here.",5,2014,07,10
204,Great location!,Stayed for a night in this hotel. Great location. Drove up to the front door and car was parked in car park for me. Had a wonderful experience in hotel michelin star restaurant. Location perfect. Walked to local bars nearby. Highly recommend. ☺,4,2014,07,09
204,Business stay,"Stayed mid week , staff were very welcoming and friendly. Room was good but had a few minor scuffs here and there. Nice touch turning the bed down, chocolates were loverly.  Breakfast service was average lots of staff but they lacked attentiveness . Location is excellent and close for shops, bars and restaurants.",4,2014,07,09
204,great location,"The Fitzwilliam's location was perfect for us, just across the street from St. Stephen's Green.  The service was friendly, efficient and professional.  My only complaint was the price which seemed a bit high, but as they say, you get what you pay for.",5,2014,07,09
204,Wish we had stayed longer,"I had not been to Dublin in years and thought we would make a pit stop on our way west.  Now, in no small part due to the wonderful Fitzwilliam Hotel I wish we could have extended our stay. But we will be back. 

The lobby is so lovely and modern with nods to the past; the large portraits harken back to an earlier time but the color palate evokes a more modern Ireland. Gracious but not overbearing staff  welcomed us and helped us to our room, which fronted St Stephen's Green. The street car noise didn't bother us.  We are New Yorkers and used to street sounds. The view was lovely. The room was comfortable and the green bathtub was divine. Irish breakfast was plentiful. Wifi was excellent.  Location was great for sightseeing and well located for business travelers. Loved it and hope to return soon for a longer stay!",5,2014,07,08
204,Super Stay,"I can highly recommend this hotel. The location, at the top of Grafton St, is excellent.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Definitely a five star hotel without the pomp & ceremony of other five star hotels. I can also recommend a cocktail from the bar, The Inn House Special, delicious!
The beds are the most comfortable I've ever slept in.",5,2014,07,08
204,Weekend with friends,Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights reception staff where friendly  our room was small but very nice the bed and pillows where so comfortable the breakfast was very nice also the bar staff where great can't wait to return ,5,2014,07,08
204,Love this hotel!,"We got a great rate at this hotel and were excited to try it. The location is superb! Right across from St Stephen's Green and easily accessible to all attractions in the City. The hotel room is very quiet and beautifully decorated. It even has live orchids in it. The toiletries are lovely and the bed very comfortable. Also a big surprise was that the air conditioning actually worked beautifully! We've had several weeks in Ireland where the hotels we stayed at advertised air conditioning but miraculously the air conditioning seem to be malfunctioning when we arrived. It was delightful to have a quiet, dark, cool sleep in this lovely hotel. The fitness room is very small so don't plan on working out. Enjoy the city & the lovely service here.  Complementary bottles of water are supplied each day as well. Fresh apples are available as you exit the elevator.",5,2014,07,07
204,Nice place but rooms quite small,"Very well situated on St Stephens's Green and close to all the amenities of Dublin.  Comfortable hotel but room was rather small although very quiet and situated away from the main street.  Ideal to relax or work in. Very friendly staff.

Breakfast area over looked the reception area and was cramped and noisy. Disconcertingly the floor moved when you walked across - it seems to have become detached and anyone with difficulty in walking may find the sea going motion uncomfortable. Breakfast and dinner were disappointing considering fine foods Ireland has to offer.",3,2014,07,07
204,Excellent Quality,"This hotel is beautiful. Upon arriving the staff unloaded our luggage and brought it up to our room while we checked in. Our package included breakfast which I would suggest to anyone because the Citron restaurant was lovely.  We were located very well near St. Stephens Green, Grafton, and Suffolk Street, which allowed us to walk several places without issue.",5,2014,07,07
204,"Great location, great staff, great hotel!","We stayed here for 1 night and really enjoyed the experience.  From check-in to check-out the staff were brilliant (especially Ailee on the front desk and Kevin and Olesea in the restaurant).  The room was lovely and the hotel facilities were amazing.  The location is wonderful, right in the heart of everything and close to all you could want, yet the hotel is serene and peaceful.  Will definitely be recommending this to family, friends and work colleagues and will hopefully be back myself!! 
      ",5,2014,07,07
204,"Great hotel, great staff, especially when the roof falls in","It's in a perfect location. you can walk just about anywhere from the hotel. A warning if you drive there - if you get in the wrong lane on the square you can go round in ever decreasing circles and miss the hotel. Mark its location well. The room was spacious and had all the amenities. For us the highlight was the concierge staff. They were very helpful with directions and with recommendations for restaurants and points of interest. Unfortunately I was pickpocketed on Grafton Street and they got my wallet. That was credit cards, driving licence, ID card etc. etc. And that's when the hotel staff went the extra mile. They helped make calls to Canada, to card agencies and assisted us with police reports and the like. I'm sure some of you know how devastating it can be when you get robbed. You need a friend and the hotel was right there for us. In summary a first class hotel and first class people. Thank you.",5,2014,07,05
204,Amazing,"Just back from the nicest hotel ive ever stayed in. Reception staff could not have been any more helpful, room was spacious overlooking the courtyard, lovely comfy bed and pillows. The bathroom was filled with toiletries and lovely gowns and slippers. The ambience of the hotel was lovely, staff so friendly. 
The breakfast layout was exceptional ranging from pastries, special coffees and fruit smoothies and the cooked breakfast was outstanding.
Will definitly be returning.",5,2014,07,05
204,Early lunch,"We went to the fitzwilliam for lunch yesterday it was the start of fantastic day , my wife's birthday. The girls started with cocktails black jack , and a raspberry concoction delicious . We only had mains the girls had a fish butty served with fries and dill mayo , the dish of the day tagattelli with asparagus very rich and creamy , I had brisket on a floury bap. . Overall presentation very good service excellent , the cocktail waiter was on a day shift which helped . Will return . We'll done",4,2014,07,04
204,Short stay in Dublin,"An extremely comfortable stay in a great central location. The hotel is expensive but probably quite typical for its star rating. Staff were helpful and courteous when we required advice on a close by local restaurant, albeit the result was a bit disappointing (the Hairy Lemon was over priced and really basic). Good wifi connection, cocktail bar and breakfast restaurant. The courtesy umbrella is also very helpful for the Irish rain! Only minor frustration was the lengthy checking out time but it was a minor issue and nothing to worry about if you're in no rush.",4,2014,07,02
204,Modern hotel in the heart of Dublin,"Very centrally located, right next to the shopping district and just across from St Stephen's Green. Trinity College is just a short walk away. 

Rooms are fairly spacious and we got one with a balcony overlooking St Stephen's Green which was lovely. Beds are four poster which don't do anything for me. 

The only drawback is that the hotel is above one of Dublin's most popular clubs and we could hear their drunk patrons singing and shouting late into the night. If you are a light sleeper, best to ask for a room facing the back of the hotel.",4,2014,07,01
204,"Excellent service, great location","My husband stayed here on business, and I tagged along.  The location is AWESOME - close to everything.  The front desk staff, the concierges, the wait staff, the housekeeping staff - all were excellent - good at their job and exceedingly polite.  I did find it quite expensive, and the decor was appallingly bad.  I don't know who chose the chairs in the room, but they have hopefully turned their design expertise to fast food restaurants.  The bed was amazingly comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed.  Our room rate had breakfast included and it was excellent.  We also had drinks in the lounge in the evening, and dinner at Thornton's, and all was exquisite.  I would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,06,30
204,Good... but,"Whilst the hotel room experience is very good - there are some very dissatisfying and disappointing elements that will stay with me, and outshine the quality of service and general amenities.  

4 things annoyed me:
1. When I arrived into my room - I needed to borrow a charger for my iPhone - and whilst the concierge handled everything perfectly - there was no way I could keep my phone with me (very frustrating - as I was expecting a call which I need to take) - and therefore I had to leave my phone downstairs with the desk.  I would suggest the hotel take some time to (a) increase budget on purchasing more phone charges in case of emergency for guests or (b) change the process on the limited amount they have - whereby a guest could leave €20 with the desk whilst they re-charge their phone for 30 minutes.

2. Breakfast was very disappointing.  It looked good from afar - but turned out that everything was overcooked and dry

3. Upon check out (only!) I was advised via my bill that there was a €10 charge for parking my car in the hotel car park! I have never heard of this in my entire life - especially for a hotel who claims to have a high level of service.  Not only that - but upon departure... it turns out that the overnight charge to the public is LESS THAN €10.  

4. And the final gripe I would have unfortunately is that there is NO area in the hotel where smokers can enjoy their cigarette/cigar except for direction outside the entrance of the hotel - which is a very busy thoroughfare - and requires long trips from your hotel room, into the lift and through the lobby to undertake. 

Outside of those items - the quality of the amenities and the service from staff was very good - but when paying a high price for a stay - that should be standard.  The other items are what I am left putting me off staying in the Fitzwilliam again.",3,2014,06,30
204,"A tired, noisy room in great location","I heard many good things but finding ourselves in a small room on the 6th floor , which has no lift access, made me feel like a second class customer. The furniture needs updating and having curtains that fit would be good. Decisive reception staff who know the locality would help. Overall a disappointment for the money",3,2014,06,28
204,Dublin's Most Friendly and Best Hotel,"This is my second trip to Dublin, and the second hotel I have stayed in -- and it will be the ONLY hotel I choose in the future.  Quality of the hotel, rooms, food, wireless, and service are all top notch.  However, I cannot overemphasize the excellent and friendly service we received from all employees which was outstanding and sometimes unexpected!  A doorman even asked to take our garbage for us as we were entering the hotel one day after touring! Every server in the restaurant and room service was friendly, and we especially loved the superb helpfulness and friendliness from the concierges. We did have a question about were to get water as the hotel does not provide an in-house store to buy water or incidentals; however, a bottle of free water is available every day and hotel is close to many other shops and venues.  Speaking of location -- we were especially pleased with how close we were to many of the sights and how it was not on a busy congested traffic street.  I rate the hotel 5 stars and would come back tomorrow if I could!",5,2014,06,25
204,The Citron Restaurant/ Excellent food,"We had a meal last week at the Citron Restaurant. It was the first day of the summer menu. We had been here before, so we had high expectations. It definitely did not disappoint. It was obvious that a lot of work had gone into each of the dishes...
 Crab for starter, Duck for mains and Chocolate pannacotta for dessert.
 Each one was really delicious and a lovely combination of tastes and flavours. The staff were efficient and friendly. If you manage to get one of the vouchers that come online now and again , you will get excellent value for money. An excellent meal !!!",5,2014,06,23
204,"Elegant Hotel , good location","Stayed here on business, really elegant Hotel. Rooms are well equipped for a business traveler & spacious considering city location. Hotel is very well positioned / located. Food was good although breakfast was very 'basic' and for the price & 5 star rating you would expect a bit more

Only grumble was trying to check out , long ques , 2 desk clerks and staff milling around rtaher than helping customers pay & get going",4,2014,06,23
204,Wonderful Hotel,Just had a lovely three night stay and have to say that we were treated exceptionally well.  The person who checked us in actually took us to our room and was most helpful showing us how everything worked.  Location was excellent within walking distance of many good restaurants and the theatre.  We would definitely return to this hotel when we're back in Dublin.,5,2014,06,23
204,The best cocktails!,"We usually have a pre dinner cocktail here and last night was no exception. Thankfully Peter was on duty as both himself and Alex make superb cocktails! They both provide excellent customer service and are truly excellent at their job! I usually opt for a Patron Margarita and my husband has a half and half manhattan on the rocks, no simple syrup or cheep booze here, pure alcohol. Totally recommend it for drinks!",5,2014,06,21
204,Hugely overpriced,"Had we paid half what we did I would probably have given the Fitzwilliam Hotel 5 stars but it is horrendously expensive for what we got.  The location couldn't be better and we enjoyed our stay but for that price expected so much more.  The room was small and the decor definitely not my taste (in fact I can't imagine it would be anyone's taste) and although the bed was very comfortable and the bedlinen quite sumptuous it was just a normal sized double bed - not acceptable in a five star hotel.  The air conditioning didn't work and the bathroom flooded, both of which problems were fixed as soon as we reported them but surely someone should check these things before rooms are allocated.  I was only able to find two power points in the room which was very inconvenient.  The staff couldn't have been more pleasant and helpful and they do deserve 5 stars.",3,2014,06,20
204,Very good but w deficits,"good, very central location with well appointed and stylish rooms. the bathrooms are particularly good. the hotel's greatest asset bar the above is it's staff. across the board they were superb  - particular note of Viktor, one of the concierge team.
my only complaint was the breakfast - we went to this hotel having had two great visits to the Belfast version. in this latter Dublin instance, the vegetarian breakfast option had vanished and an additional payment was required for certain dishes. some of the ingredients also looked less than premium, and at odds with the premium price paid. if you want breakfast however it may be cheaper to purchase at check in rather than in advance - double check.",4,2014,06,20
204,good but small rooms,"We stayed there for 3 nights during a holiday in Dublin. The hotel is good; the location is excellent rooms are very nice though (the deluxe rooms which are more expensive) are quit they small so I can't imagine the size of the standard rooms. Service are good and friendly. The air-con, if you have to use it, and we had to due to the warm weather is very noisy and disturbing as it blows the air directly on the bed.  This was the main disadvantage of the room and of the say.",4,2014,06,19
204,Wonderful place,"It is very rare in this day and age to walk in a Hotel you stayed at one time and be received like family. This Hotel not only cares about the details of making a stay comfortable with great beds , perfect location, and beautiful design, they are focused on the core value that most of us seek when traveling which is the human kindness experience. My daughter goes to College in Dublin and when traveling there she meets me at the Hotel. I found her embraced in a conversation with the concierge who help plan our time together with thoughtful restaurant choices for her to enjoy as a student as well as those restaurants to enjoy with me while visiting . I had not stayed at this Hotel since October of last year but was greeted by name by all those who work there. Followed by, ""How is your daughter enjoying school here?"" Well, we had drinks in their lovely bar after a wonderful dinner that they recommended at Il Volete in Temple bar , and we love the little coffee bar next door called the bald barista where the cashier gave my daughter a gift card for her birthday. I missed my wake up call on my departure day and they sent someone up to knock on my door to make sure I was up. The details of the room are great , comfortable sheets , nice showers . I had brunch on Sunday at the Hotel and the design of the mezzanine dining area is beautiful with perfect attention to the guests dining . I can not say enough about how welcoming and nice this Hotel is. Highly recommend it. One small detail is that the bathroom shower is in a very comfortable bathtub that I would not suggest for someone like my parents(83 years old) as the depth could present a relatively high slip risk for someone . Outside of this...perfect!",5,2014,06,17
204,fitzwilliam hotel dublin,"We booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin due to its location and as we had stayed in Belfast Fitzwilliam Hotel and had loved their breakfast options. We were escorted to our room by the gentleman at reception but at the rip old age of 40 I believe my husband and I could have made the trip alone! But my biggest grievance would be breakfast -€22 5star hotel - so once I order scrambled eggs I expect  to have the chief crack the eggs on receiving the order - but no I believe these eggs were cook earlier that morning - my husband also ordered porridge and a full irish - they both came together -he had ordered a poached egg but it came hard - obviously made at the same time as my eggs!!! I also ordered French toast which had a €5 supplement - is this additional cost due to it being made fresh! The hotel is comfortable but really nothing special but the food really let it down - more of a 3star! 
      
      ",3,2014,06,16
204,fab city hotel,"Excellent in almost every respect. The porter knowing that our feet were killing us as we walked up Grafton street to the hotel very kindly walked to meet us to collect our suitcases …. how good is that?? 
Reception staff were amazing and unbelievably helpful. 
We couldn't believe how quiet the hotel was for a central city centre hotel …. 
The room service was excellent and very quick ..
The complimentary newspaper was much appreciated as were the apples in the corridors (useful when skipping breakfast)
The only down side was the poor quality hair dryer in the bedroom but was IMMEDIATELY replaced for a better powered one when we phoned down and the lighting was poor quality which because of the hotel being eco friendly didnt give out much light. 
All in all I would highly recommend this fantastic contemporary hotel.
      ",5,2014,06,16
204,Great Location,"You can't beat the location of this hotel. It's right across the street from St. Steven's Green which is an amazing park.  It's very close to Trinity College, Grafton Street, etc.  The rooms were small but comfortable.  The staff was great...they went out of their way to help us find places to eat and recommended some really charming pubs.  I would stay there again.",4,2014,06,15
204,One of the best decisions I ever made.,"After traveling around Ireland all week by car, I decided to pick a luxury hotel for two nights in Dublin, no matter the cost.  In other words, my goal was to splurge and not to look for a good bargain.  Our suite was wonderful and very comfortable.  The bath tub was huge.  Sometimes it was hard to pull ourselves away because we just wanted to relax in our room.  The hotel is in a great location and the staff was very helpful to a couple of neophytes.  I felt safe and new we could find someone to help us if we ever had questions or needed advice.  Our room was spacious but there was not view to speak of.  I was able to ditch the rental car early and take a taxi to the airport.",5,2014,06,14
204,Budget hotel with a luxury hotel rate,"Starting with the positive - the location was simply amazing. Right in the heart of Dublin, walking distance to all the great places to visit. However, this is not a hotel I would stay at again. Nothing was terrible, but everything was less than satisfactory - the room was nice but small, the bathroom was clean but the faucet leaked, the in-room hot beverage was instant coffee and cheap teabags (beautiful cups and teapot, though), and the minibar malfunctioned. The worst part of the experience was being charged 10 Euros for one local phone call, which the check-out staff wasn't able to resolve. If this were a budget hotel, I would not have complained, but it was definitely not worth the luxury hotel rate we paid for.",2,2014,06,12
204,Beautiful hotel - great location,This is a beautiful hotel right beside the main shopping area in Dublin (Grafton St. etc.) and also many attractions. Staff really friendly and helpful. Lovely atmosphere in the lobby. Room was not as spacious as I would have thought but plenty for 2 people. I liked the seated area beside the window. Bathroom lovely and clean though I noticed quite a bad crack in a tile which took away from the presentation. Didn't have breakfast included which was fine since there are many beautiful places for breakfast nearby. Parking facilities and price was superb. Would definitely stay here again.,4,2014,06,11
204,Family trip to Dublin,"Great hotel and location. We were in walking distance to many attractions, and the location is safe.    Service was outstanding and our plan included breakfast which offered many options and was delicious.  Someday we plan to return",5,2014,06,10
204,Much of a muchness,"Would not say there was anything particular good or bad about the Fitzwilliam. It was just pretty averagely nice! Staff friendly, rooms clean, breakfast ok. I had a problem with the shower temperature which was a tad annoying - mentioned it to the check out staff who were very understanding.",3,2014,06,09
204,Rather a ****-Hotel,"I was three days / three nights in this hotel. First the positive aspectes: I have rarely encountered such friendly, helpful staff at the concierge desk or at the front desk of a hotel. The people there deserve an Oscar. The room was large and spacious, the bathroom as well. The central situation of the hotel may also be mentioned on the positive side.
Unfortunately, I cannot  say same for the infrastructure. I did not get the quiet room with ""panoramic views of the courtyard"" as ordered and promised. Despite the thick double-window the noise of the street musicians could be heard. As a bonus, I could hear all night an irritating sound that I believed to come from the engine room next to it. The breakfast buffet is approximately equal to that in a three, maximum four-star hotel. The TV probably came from the nineties, foreign language programs unavailable. Unfortunately, I also had bad luck with the free Wi-Fi offered: it worked simply not in spite of the amiable and energetic help of the staff from the concierge desk and the reception. The Gym consists of three units, one of which did not work, and a pair of dumbbells. Reading at night in bed was impossible; the lamps spread an extremely dim light. Under these conditions no longer disturbed the rather uncomfortable seating.",3,2014,06,09
204,Great Hotel in great area for sightseeing,Recently stayed and had a great time. Short distance to Trinity and Templebar area. Only stayed one night but was very pleased to have chosen this hotel. Room décor was nice and it had all the amenities that you needed. Wish I had the time to stay longer and if I go back to Dublin I will be definitely be staying there.,5,2014,06,09
204,European elegance and service,We were delighted from beginning to end with the Fitzwilliams.  The location is perfect - close to everything but off to the side enough to be serene.  The staff is well trained and attentive.  The room was well appointed and had many lovely extra touches like chocolates on the beds each evening.  We recommend it without hesitation.  ,5,2014,06,09
204,Bad of both Occasions,"Booked room and called hotel to book room for colleague. Told there was no rooms available so asked to cancel my room and hey presto a room was available. Corporate rate includes breakfast but was charged and booking didn't state fact. Allocated room on 6th floor and curtains were broken, asked to be moved as no way of blocking light out of room. Moved to another 6th floor room and curtains whilst not broken were too small for window. Got moved to 3rd floor. On checkout I got charged for breakfast, complained and quite rudely told it wasn't included. 

Second stay the following week, only as colleagues were staying there. Checked online booking that breakfast was included, it was. Called hotel to clarify and also to request room not on 6th floor. Assured breakfast was included. On check-in was given larger room on 5th floor, and told breakfast was not included. Said I had personally spoken to reservations to clarify, and asked to ""Prove it"". On check-out charged for breakfast, so asked for reservation staff to come to reception. Supervisor Receptionist then removed charge straight away.

The rooms on 6th floor are tiny, slightly better on the 3rd, and the deluxe room on the 5th better again. Will not stay here by choice again. 

The only good experience is that the check-out receptionist, who had a trainee badge, was the most pleasant I had met during both visits.",1,2014,06,08
204,"Great location, excellent service!","This was our first trip to Ireland, so our travel agent recommended this hotel.  We loved it!  Even though we arrived earlier than expected, we were immediately escorted to our room.  Due to issues at the airport, we were 1/2 an hour late for the massages we had booked at their spa, but Ursula was very gracious and understanding.  The massages were fantastic after getting off a long flight, as was the facial.  What a great introduction to Dublin! 

Loved the accommodations, and like many other reviewers, the location.  We enjoy walking and exploring, so this was perfect for us.  Although we didn't spend a lot of time in our room or at the hotel, we do have to say the breakfast choices were good, the food was delicious, and all of the staff we interacted with were very nice and helpful.  We would definitely return.",5,2014,06,07
204,Not a five star experience,"We selected the Fitzwilliam on an Irish friends recommendation and the position on St Stephens Square was excellent with shopping nearby and superb restaurants within easy walking distance.
Our room was comfortable and well equipped although our used drinking glasses often were not replaced.
We arrived with significant luggage after a month away but there was no- one Kerb-side to help us bring in our cases until we manhandled them into the lobby, when one of the concierges assisted us.At Checkin at the beginning of a Bank weekend, we enquired about laundry and were told it would be available over the weekend which subsequently was not the case. This necessitated my wife needing to buy some more clothes to attend various social functions.
Breakfast was satisfactory but on one busy morning we were not offered a cooked breakfast and required two requests for jam for our toast.
Some of the concierges were unhelpful, even arrogant, while others were helpful.
We expressed our disappointment on checkout and to give the hotel it's due, the very concerned Manager Mr Fergal O'Connell discussed our experience with us, apologising for it not being as expected.As the majority of our issues were staff related, further training might improve the situation.",4,2014,06,07
204,GREAT CITY BREAK,"Stayed last weekend on 2 night City Break with the family. Excellent service, very friendly staff, dinner in Citron Friday night was great, special dishes for fussy kids no problem, breakfasts wonderful and strange requests for pancake with bacon did not cause any problems. Wonderful location, very comfortable and quiet rooms. Thanks to all the staff for a lovely weekend.",5,2014,06,07
204,Perfect birthday treat,"As a family we chose this excellently located hotel for a birthday celebration. From check in to departure taxi the 90 year old birthday boy was treated like royalty. The stylish, well equipped rooms were clean and quiet. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant which was ( surprisingly ) good. They willingly provided separate child friendly choices. Throughout the admittedly expensive, short stay the staff showed the best side of multicultural Irish hospitality. Specific  praise to the restaurant manager during the breakfast rush, who rescued the birthday cake!",5,2014,06,05
204,"Excellent Hotel, Perfect Location","We couldn't have asked more from the Fitzwilliam. Perfect location for exploring the city by foot. Great shopping, restaurants and sights nearby. Very impressed by the hotel amenities and staff. The concierge gave a great recommendation for a nearby restaurant.",5,2014,06,03
204,The best location in Dublin,"When you walk out the door you are right across the street from St Stephen's green and just around the corner you get all the great shopping and dining of Dublin. The location of this hotel is fantastic, but that is just the beginning. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The room was really superb, a large room with lots of amenities, a large bathroom with a smart design, everything was top notch.

The breakfast was incredible! Every imaginable breakfast food is included and the service is great - very helpful and friendly staff. We had dinner at the hotel one night and it was delicious too.

There are so many incredibly good restaurants in walking distance of this hotel, and in fact we didn't have a car in Dublin - trust me, you don't want a car. We love to walk, so we even walked all the way to the Guiness Storehouse and Kilmainhain Goal from here but the public transportation from this location looks convenient.

The only bad thing I have to say about our stay here is that it was too short - we had only 3 nights at this hotel but we would go back in a heartbeat!",5,2014,06,02
204,very disappointing,"My friend and I were very disappointed in the Fitzwilliam and it did not live up to its 5 star rating.  There was not one major thing but a catalog of small problems.  The room was fine but the beside tables and bathroom door showed damage and wear and tear.  When standing in the corridors you could see a massive gaps under some doors which suggests that the doors were not fitted properly.  House keeping left no water in the room and when we called down for some 2 lots arrived within 5 minutes of each other.

The main problem though was the level of customer service, not at all what you would expect from a 5* hotel and after all that is what makes the real difference between and 4 and 5 star hotel.

The concierge although friendly and helpful recommended a tapas bar but sent us to the wrong street so we never found it until the following morning  We were also inquiring about tickets for a tour and were told we would have to book it on the Monday (they were closed over the weekend). Fair enough but come Monday morning it was sold out and we found out subsequently that it was possible to book online over the weekend.  The door man was extremely rude when we asked about all the crowds outside the hotel (a band was apparently staying)  and the barman was also rude  when we went in for a night cap!

I logged my complaints with the night manager and he put it on the system.  But what really annoyed me was when we checked out the following morning the receptionist did not check the system and had no idea about my complaints.  When I made her aware it was then escalated to another receptionist. I was told that the other staff member had just started her shift and had not looked at the complaints system yet!  Hardly my problem and she should have been fully aware of all issues before dealing with the public.  The 2nd receptionist then escalated it to the duty manager and asked me to wait whilst she could be found.  

So after having been through my complaints twice the duty manager turns up 20 mins later.  She was very aggressive with us, again we had to explain everything and again she said the same things as the 2 previous staff had, adding nothing nothing new.  At this point I was very annoyed as had been polite and patient all the way through this long drawn out process!  When we pointed out that her attitude was poor she became even more hostile and finally offered to refund 1 drink off our bill!!!!  It took us over an hour to check out in the end. 

Customer service is what makes a good 5* hotel.  It was definitely lacking during my stay and the duty manager's attitude was appalling.   I would not recommend this hotel.",2,2014,06,01
204,Don't Hesitate to Stay Here,"The sign of a great hotel is not just how it feels initially, but how they respond to inevitable glitches during a longer stay.  The Fitzwilliam passes this test with flying colors. We stayed here for a total of six nights at the recommendation of our travel agent (who clearly has some kind of relationship with the property).  Although we got off to a rocky start with a noisy room and other nuisances, the hotel manager, Fergal O'Connell,  corrected these problems in spades.  He could not have been more apologetic or less defensive.  His entire focus was on turning around the experience...and he did.  If you're the type to do a slow burn and say nothing, then don't expect too much here or anywhere else for that matter.  A simple statement of our concerns were addressed more than to our satisfaction.  With all of that said, the property is well situated across from the park and near shopping.  You can easily walk to Trinity College, the Hop On/Hop Off Bus, and good restaurants.  The rooms are reasonably sized and well appointed.  The staff wants to serve you well and is friendly without being phony.  We loved eating and having cocktails in their ground floor pub. Service was good and food great.  I recommend the prawns on baquettes.  The inclusive breakfast was delicious.  More than ample with choices ranging from the continental fare to hot food prepared as requested.  Don't expect perfection, nothing is perfect, but do expect complete satisfaction.",4,2014,05,30
204,Great Location in Belfast,"A group of 30 of us from our church took a 10-day tour bus vacation around Ireland. Our second stop was the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast.  Location was perfect.  We could walk to many shops and restaurants.  It's located right next to the Opera House, where we saw the play Cinderella.  Lots to love about this place.  Rooms had all the modern amenities.",5,2014,05,29
204,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location","The hotel and staff was wonderful. We were afraid of the language barrier but there was none. They directed us and gave us pointers. St. Stephen's Green was right across the street. We had fantastic morning and evening walks. The room was neat and clean, very comfortable. It was located in the middle of all the places we wanted to go by walking. Place was stylish and very welcoming. ",5,2014,05,28
204,wonderful service,Rooms are clean and comfortable. Service is great and the concierges can't do enough for you. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choices and the dinner deal for was amazing. The only complaint I have was the parking fee. They gave us a pass to get out and it didn't work. Stuck at gate and had to go back to desk to repay. Should have been in room bill.,5,2014,05,28
204,Disappointed here of late,"Have stayed here on business countless times but for the past 5 or so trips have tried other hotels as I feel their standards here have dropped. 

This review summarises previous trips to the Fitzwilliam in the past 6 months:

I went to get a towel down and a half used bottle of shampoo flew out from between the 2 towels, it gave me concern about whether both towels were actually clean.

My colleague did not have as nice a room as I did on our last visit, we unexpectedly had to stay another night, when we asked for a room change so that my colleague could have a nicer room for the second night we were told there were no rooms of that type left, as soon as we were heard talking about moving hotels ... surprise ... suddenly there was a room.

It is an absolute disgrace to be charged an additional 5 € for pancakes for breakfast to be given a quarter of a pancake only.

We have a corporate rate with this hotel and spend thousands with them per annum, I was booked in by a new assistant using an agent without realising we have to email the hotel direct. This meant breakfast was not booked and the room was more expensive. Whilst this was an honest mistake on our behalf, I was truly surprised that the hotel were not prepared to at least include breakfast without charging extra, but they absolutely were not prepared to make this concession. This meant that my colleague who had emailed the hotel directly was staying with breakfast at a cheaper rate than I was staying without breakfast. I do accept this was not the hotel's fault but it surprises me that they were not prepared to compromise for the sake of keeping regular customers happy. 

The mattresses in this hotel (and I have slept in a large number of the rooms by now!) are often lumpy and feel as if they need to be replaced. If you remove the duvet you can often actually see 2 body indents in far too many of their mattresses especially on floor 4.

On the positive side, the staff are generally pleasant, we have always had good service and enjoyable meals in the bar and it has to be said that the Fitzwilliam is in a prime location.",2,2014,05,28
204,Convenient location and excellent service,"We recently stayed at this hotel through a Delta Vacations trip. We arrived early in the morning and were pleased our rooms were ready. The bed was comfortable and bath very nice. The breakfast was outstanding with many choices of hot/cold items. But the high point was the customer service: upon checking out of the hotel, we headed to Heuston station for an early train to Galway. With just 20 minutes to boarding, we realized we had left our passports locked in the safe at the hotel. With much help from the customer service desk at the train station, we were able to contact the hotel concierge who was then kind enough to get the passports and have a reliable driver bring them to us at the station. Within 15 minutes, we had the passports in hand and were on our way to Galway (with just 2 minutes to spare!). So thanks to the Fitzwilliam staff, who went above and beyond in helping us out!!",5,2014,05,28
204,Excellent Centrally located hotel,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for one night. I have to give top marks for everything. The porters were very efficient with our bags and parked our car in the parking lot below (which is very reasonable at €10 per day). Our receptionist was a delight, very professional, friendly and thorough. The room itself was spacious with a modern feel and one of the most comfortable mattresses we've ever slept on. This is a very quiet hotel which was a worry as it is very central. All in all we will stay at the Fitzwilliam again, and the barman does a whacking Margeurita.",5,2014,05,28
204,Super location for Dublin,"Have never visited the hotel although I've been to other 5 star hotels in the area. This is far better. The room overlooked St Stephens Green but the insulation was super and no street noise disturbed at night. However, waking up and looking out at the greenery was refreshing in the middle of a city. Thorntons restaurant was an experience. Although the acoustics are not great and a rowdy group was a bit disturbing, the dinner was exquisite.",5,2014,05,28
204,just OK,"My husband and I checked in while the band One Direction supposedly was staying there, so we were greeted by a mob of teenagers out front.  We stayed in a ""suite"" however it was no bigger than any average hotel room, so not worth the extra money in my opinion.  The doors slam VERY hard, making it difficult for a light sleeper to get a good nights rest.  The bathrooms are amazing, large with gigantic tub.  The hotel is in a perfect location for walking around Dublin.  Having stayed at the Merrion as well, I would recommend that hotel over the Fitzwilliam if you are looking for a quiet classy stay in Dublin.",4,2014,05,27
204,Very Comfortable,"Stayed here recently while attending a show, the room was comfortable, clean and all slept very well. As it is centrally located it's the ideal base while touring or shopping in the city.
Breakfast was very good with plenty to choose from.
The only negative was when we ordered a hot chocolate at 11:00pm the staff member was not happy as he had cleaned the machine and made sure we were aware of it, however it was served and was delicious.",4,2014,05,27
204,Still my top choice ... but,"My wife I stayed at the Fitzwilliam only 3 months ago and were pleased to make return trip.  Everything that I said before stands - generally speaking.  Three factors should be noted.  Not all of the rooms are as spacious as the one I reviewed on the last occasion!  More crucially, the bathroom fittings in the room on this occasion need attention; the basin plug had to be replaced - how this was not noticed by staff or previous visitors escapes me; the taps dripped badly and the shower reminded me of the old style house shower where a warning had to be given, ""Don't use the hot water -I'm having a shower!""  Lastly, the safe could not be locked and was not repaired during our 2-day stay.  The bed was extremely comfortable as were the pillows.",4,2014,05,25
204,Best customer service ever!,"The concierges, front desk and owner (manager?) of this hotel make it their business to help you with whatever little problem you have!  They were incredible.  The room was comfortable and nicely decorated, pleasant view of the courtyard from big windows.  My only suggestion: more shelves and drawers for our clothes.  Fabulous location in a pleasant, bustling area, right on the park.",5,2014,05,22
204,Loverly time,"We spent 4 days in Dublin in January 2014, it was very clean and very modern. Right in the middle or next to Stephens green, walking distance to pretty much everywhere.

The bed was very, very comfy and the bath could have bathed an elephant it was brill. The hotel offered some great tips where to eat out and where to drink in the evening! Which was really nice and all the staff were very helpful. 

Overall our stop here was loverly.",5,2014,05,21
204,Citron restaurant,"I recently returned to the Citron Restaurant for an early dinner. 
It is situated on the first floor of Fitzwilliam Hotel which is centrally located on Dublins Stephens Green.
The staff were exceptionally friendly and our starters of Caesar Salad and Pear Waldorf were beautifully presented.
We followed with Beef Cheeks,melt in the mouth ,washed down with a delightful Proscecco. 
Desserts were state of the art presentation ,panna cotta for me and cheese cake for my daughter.
The new chef there needs to take a bow .Simple food prepared so well and presented with aplomb.
We will be back and thanks to Aafke and Sigitas for making our visit so memorable.",5,2014,05,20
204,4 star at best!,"We booked a one night stay b&b on a flying visit to Dublin. On arrival the concierge took our car and parked it in the underground car park, a nice treat and a good start to our stay. Check in was fine with minimal fuss. Room was small and bathroom basic enough for a 5 star hotel. Shower was difficult to work. On returning to our room at pros 1pm, load music from the nearby bar was very audible in our room. This went on until around 2:30am. Again this was something you wouldn't expect from a 5 star hotel. We didn't complain about the music that night as we were never going to move rooms at that time in the night. We did mention it to the receptionist when we were checking out and to be fair to her, she did not charge us for the parking given the issues we had from the night before. It wasn't a huge issue for us as we were a young couple and did get a decent sleep when the music stopped. Have to say the breakfast was very nice with a good selection of hot and cold foods. The toast was perfect, something that always let's us down in so many hotels. Location of the hotel is probably then best for any hotel in Dublin and is its major selling point. In summary, we had a nice stay, friendly staff and is a hotel we will consider when looking to spend a night in the centre of Dublin.",3,2014,05,20
204,Great location,Great location and helpful staff. We were only there for one night but wish we could have stayed longer to explored St Stephens Green. Room was comfortable and quiet. Enjoyed the breakfast which was part of our package. Would like to return and stay longer.,5,2014,05,20
204,Made up for by the competence of Elge,"I stayed in The Fitzwilliam on the 10th May and assumed that the service would be informed and helpful. I did presume that at £155 breakfast would be included. Unfortunately Jonathan, the receptionist who booked us in, didn't advise of that. Neither did the breakfast manager (who, incidentally was the only helpful and moderately pleasant member of staff on duty on the Sunday morning)
We had difficulty, (at least Jonathan did) with the passes for our room.  We had to report an odour in the corridor on our way out.  It was cleared that evening. 
We went down to breakfast the next morning.  Found it incredibly difficult to be attended to. The breakfast manager explained all very clearly to us and welcomed us but the staff were dreadful. We had to get up on 3 occasions to seek attention and order food/toast/hot water, we were given a pot of coffee by mistake when we had already had our tea. It was incredibly intimidating.  We stopped speaking to each other and just wanted to leave.
The shower didn't work properly either so we had to use a hand held appendage.
On check out I went to reception to check out and mention about the shower.  I had a conversation with the pleasant female receptionist  about the shower and she advised that there are continuous problems with it.  Nothing else...until I was on my way home when I received an invoice from he Fitzwilliam requesting payment for breakfast of 44 euros!!! What really freaked me was that on the invoice, on their records was that I had left without checking out!!! A total breach of information and totally untrue, so how would that affect my credit worthiness?? I hope I have this sorted with management but only time will tell......would you go back!!!!",4,2014,05,18
204,Exellent location and service,"Stayed here for Easter weekend.  The hotel is located right in the centre of town and my stayed started with a lovely concierge helping me with my massive suitcase and it being delivered to our room.  The rooms are really nice. We had a room which overlooked an inner courtyard so it was really quiet. The bathroom was quite large and really clean. 
The hotel is really close to Wexford Street and George Street which have loads of really nice restaurants and bars.
We went out for dinner but had a few drinks in the bar when we got back which was quite nice.   
A big surprise on coming back to the hotel room Easter Saturday night was a lovely easter egg waiting for us in our room. 
We only had breakfast in the hotel one morning but the staff were very accommodating even though we literally arrived at the latest time possible.
Definitely a lovey hotel for a romantic weekend away.",5,2014,05,18
204,very solid place...great location,i got a deal on the rooms -- i paid about 300 per night in connection w a promotion...at that price it was a very good deal.  the location is incredible --right off of stephens green in the heart of dublin.....and the staff is so nice.  marcin the concierge in particular made sure that i was all set and made some good suggestions for pubs and restaurants.  he also suggested the jameson tour which was fun.  The rooms were clean and fine...this is definitely not a 5 star hotel but it was ideal for business.  i would not stay here w my wife...to me it wasnt that kind of hotel.....the lobby is tiny and basic....no spa and the gym is tiny,4,2014,05,17
204,Perfect Spot,"This was our first stop, after an overnight flight.  Staff were friendly and accommodating.  Rooms are very nice and comfortable. Location was perfect for our only day in Dublin.  Grafton St. is interesting with restaurants, shops and music.  St. Stephens Green is directly across the street from the Fitzwilliam, and was a beautiful spot to take a walk.",5,2014,05,14
204,Good central location,We stayed here for two nights in May. Prior to arriving we were called to confirm our booking so I was able to inform the hotel that we would be arriving after 10pm. We were lucky enough to arrive before 10:30 so were able to eat in the Inn on the Green bar. The room was well appointed and the bathroom and toiletries were very nice. Our one grumble was that the wifi was very temperamental with both of us losing access and then having problems reconnecting on a number of occasions. ,4,2014,05,14
204,"Convenient location, comfy beds","While I really enjoyed the service staff and my stay in general, there were a couple items that could be improved for a more comfortable stay:
-the neighbors next to me were VERY noisy at unusual hours. They need to work on a sound proof door.
-another noise challenge was a consistent humming noise beneath me while I was trying to sleep. I finally realized that staying in room 352, I was directly above the 24/7 workout room. 
-the lack of sockets in the bathroom requires that you dry/curl your hair in front of the small mirror in the dimly lit bedroom.
-to note: if you are serious about your workout, go outside. The ""gym"" is tiny and 1/2 the equipment is broken.
On a positive note, I LOVED my private patio and the great breakfast buffet.",4,2014,05,14
204,Terrific Hotel & Service,"Was on a business trip with a colleague and we loved this hotel.  Wonderful service - from the front desk, to the concierge, to the cleaning staff, bar and finally at the restaurant.  The rooms are smaller than the usual American hotel rooms, but it has all the amenities (shampoo, conditioner, nice towels and soaps).  The staff even loaned us a converter for our powerful hairdryer and curling iron as we brought the wrong ones!  The evening concierge gave us a wonderful recommendation for local places to eat (and he was spot on). The hotel is centrally located and across the street from Trinity College.  We paid a bit extra upfront and online to get a daily hot breakfast (the usual pastries, fruit, yogurt plus wonderful Irish sausage or bacon and eggs)  - so glad we did as it made our mornings much easier.  Dublin is such a walkable city - we were next to Grafton Street and the hip fun Temple Bar area.  We didn't need public transportation as we just walked everywhere.  The hotel even has free loaner umbrellas!",5,2014,05,13
204,"Good hotel, Great location.","We found this hotel has a great location with very friendly staff with the Concierge standing out.
The room was a little disappointing for the price, we found the room was very warm and small,
when you turned on the air conditioning it was very noisy. Bathroom was small with a shower in the bath. Shower gel and Shampoo could be better quality and the hotel could do with been
a little more generous with same. The Bar in the hotel is very nice and we were given a voucher on check in for a free cocktail, this was very thoughtful and kind. The lobby area is a little worn especially the leather seats which need attention. Overall great location, room a little small but the
staff are very helpful and are always willing to help.",4,2014,05,10
204,Central and high quality.,"All in all a very good night in a hotel: Very central, great staff, spacious and clean rooms.

Breakfast not included in normal room price, had it anyway, it was ok, not great.

Point for improvement:
A bit of a queue on check-out, which is always annoying.",4,2014,05,09
204,Great Dublin Location - Excellent Hotel,"Just returned from a three-night (May 4-6) stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin.  It's located in the heart of Dublin, just across the street from St. Stephen's Green - up from Grafton street.  We (my wife and me) came to the Fitzwilliam after spending three days on tour, arriving mid-day on Sunday.  We were greeted by Cora Caples, Service Manager, who took another of our group to her room personally. She told us our room was not ready yet, so come to the bar and have some tea and talk. When our room was ready in half-hour she escorted to our room, showed us all - AC controls, lights, TV, Wi-Fi, mini-bar, safe, etc.  She was our first of many delights at the Fitzwilliam.  The room was very good - clean and quiet. The costs reasonable for the room and location.

The next morning my wife and I came to downstairs to find that a hot breakfast was included with our room stay.  Two of the waiters, Peter and Olesea did an outstanding job on service refilling our coffee/tea, bringing toast while it was still hot, checking in often to see if there was anything else we wanted.  We were so impressed with the service (unlike a recent experience in the US) I talked to the department manager, Ivan, telling him about the excellent service and quality of the food.  He asked us where we were from, had we been to Dublin, where else had we stayed.  In our discussion he found that we had an early (5:30AM) cab ride to the airport and arranged breakfast to-go, three hard-boiled eggs, rolls, two sandwiches, and two bottles of water.  That all arrived on time the day we left.

We arranged with the Dublin visitor center to have two tickets for a Dublin Green bus tour sent to us at the Fitzwilliam, on Sunday, but only one ticket arrived.  It was a Sunday so no one answered the phone at the tourist office.  We then spoke to concierge, Tony, who said ""no worries""  I'll call them tomorrow to get your tickets.  He was not able to get them (Monday was a bank holiday), but he got us Dublin Red tour bus tickets and we were off for the day as planned with no delay.

We were also trying to see a play while staying in Dublin, so asked Patrick (the other concierge) and Tony if they could arrange two tickets.  The next day they had good news - two tickets in the best seats in the house had been arranged.  They also booked a cab for our airport trip.

So our first experience a the Fitzwilliam was excellent!  Excellent location, room, and staff. They all went beyond what we expected to make us happy with the hotel.

Ross.",5,2014,05,08
204,Steps Away From Everything,"I booked this hotel for a HS graduation trip for a niece, so we would be close to shopping and other activities in Dublin.  It couldn't have worked out better.  We were steps away from Grafton Street and shopping; great food; theater; park and more.  

Every room is wonderfully designed by Sir Terence Conran and perhaps was one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in -- largely due to serene park/grassy views.  

Although we didn't stick around much to use the hotels restaurants, we found the service to be warm, friendly and with great suggestions.  You feel a little like home.  And one of the doormen even hugged us goodbye.  What more could you want?",4,2014,05,08
204,Outstanding Location & Good Choice for Dublin,"Our stay at the Fitzwilliam was very nice; overall I can't complain about the hotel which was extremely modern and beautifully appointed. They seemed under-staffed during our stay with them which caused some delays with the concierge and check in process. The hotel is extremely convenient and provides a great central location to all sites in Dublin. There were just a few things missing to make this an outstanding 5 star experience in my opinion and that simply may be a mismatch in expectations on my part. My minor complaints were simply that there was nothing special that stood out to welcome guests upon arrival or a desire to go above and beyond on the service front. The corridors were long and dark, the rooms were fairly narrow (though fine for the few days we stayed there). Overall though great location, extremely clean and modern chic hotel, just not quite in the world class 5 star level. Solid 4 stars though and definitely worth a stay at the right price.",4,2014,05,08
204,A poor 5* Hotel,"Stayed here at the start of May.
I have experienced other 5* hotels in Dublin and have to say that the Fitzwilliam is not near on par with them. Its more akin to an average four star hotel.
I ordered room service at approximately 02:30 asking for a ham sandwich only to be told that ""We've no ham !"" ok how about a cheese sandwich ? Nah sorry mate...no cheese. so what have you got. I can give you chicken. Now a chicken sandwich should be fairly straight forward but it still took 40 minutes to get it. I thought being a 5* hotel butter would be included in the price of a sandwich however I was wrong, Two pieces of dry bread and a few ""lumps"" of chicken constitute a sandwich here apparently ! - 
Two glasses of milk and a miserable chicken sandwich I found myself relived to the tune of €18.50. Seriously ! 5* prices for a 2* service.
Would I recommend the Fitzwilliam......
The location is excellent however, It shouldn't be a 5* and when compared with the competition. it falls far behind.",3,2014,05,07
204,What a fantastic place to stay,"Stayed in this lovely hotel for 5 days just before Easter this year with my sister. The staff were fantastic especially the boys on the concierge desk, they deserve a big pat on the back, nothing was too much trouble and their advise on where to eat/drink or what it see never missed the mark. Beautiful rooms and the location is great, right near the shops and pubs, everything within walking distance. Loved this place and would stay here again. Lisa and Karen Bermingham",5,2014,05,06
204,What a wonderful Hotel and Staff!!!,"I choose this Hotel because of the wonderful reviews I read on Tripadvisor. Oh boy, I was NOT disappointed at all. The Hotel is literally in the center of all the action that Dublin Center City has to offer. All the best restaurants, shopping and site seeing opportunities are right outside their doors. And, they are about 50 feet away from St Stephen's Green. Dublin's very own Central Park. 
As for the Hotel, the second we walked through the doors we were treated like VIPs. We arrived very early in the morning (around 6:30am) and they had a room available for an early check-in (and, without charge)! That is unheard of in all my travels. After taking a nap, The concierge, Marsin, completely planned my entire 2 days in Dublin and it was amazing! I'd also like to commend Jarko who made sure our stay was everything we could ask for. For, Jarko went above and beyond daily to meet our every need. I recommend the FitzWilliam",5,2014,05,05
204,Awesome location,"We really enjoyed the hotel, staff and rooms, but location is the best feature. Roll out the front door to St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Temple Bar about seven minutes on foot. Would definitely recommend this boutique hotel.",5,2014,05,02
204,Nice hotel,"Really nice hotel with warm hospitality all around which make you feel very welcome. 

Opposite the beautiful greens and right in the heart of city the hotel is well served by number of shops, pubs and restaurants with nothing being too far away. 

The rooms are nice and upgraded although in peak times the hot water in the shower is a problem so every time someone next door starts their shower then mine would go cold and I had to increase the hot water flow. Minor issue though

Overall a good hotel though a bit on the expensive side. 
",4,2014,05,01
204,Heavenly!,"A four night stay at this 5* hotel did not disappoint!  From the moment we arrived, every attention to detail was apparent and well presented.  The rooms are tastefully decorated, the beds uber-comfortable and the pillows sumptious ... a good nights' sleep is a cert in this hotel!  Spacious bathrooms, powerful showers and a housemaid coming in twice daily to ensure everything is in tip-top condition.  Complimentary water in the mini bar daily, along with toiletries in the bathroom, fluffy white bathrobes and matching slippers with a lovely window seat on which to sprawl and relax ... we could have stayed here forever!!  Although we never ate in the bar or the Michelin starred Thorntons Restaurant, we did enjoy an excellent pint of Guinness in the bar on more than one occasion.  When cramming in a large amount of sightseeing, a hotel that is comfortable, central and discreetly cares for all your needs is essential ... this hotel is a superstar and meets all those needs ... would highly recommend!!",5,2014,05,01
204,Heaven!,"We stayed for one night recently for a special event, and were not disappointed! Everything was spot-on, from parking to the room and the restaurant, and all the little extra touches. The room was perfect, the heating controls were simple and effective, and all the extras added up to a great night. The staff were friendly and efficient, and helped out with all questions (not that there were many!). The location is perfect for night life, yet the room was the quietest I have ever stayed at. Would love to go again soon...",5,2014,04,29
204,another wonderful stay at this hotel,This hotel is the best located 5 star property in Dublin. The staff are so professional and well-trained. We stayed this time in a standard room which is small but very well equipped. Bedlinen and pillows are top class. Turn down service with superior chocolates. We got lovely complimentary sweets on arrival in our room because we were returning guests.,5,2014,04,28
204,5 Star hotel??,"We have just returned from a night stay at Fitzwilliam hotel, really disappointed!! I would not rate this as a 5 star hotel. Concierge staff were very helpful on arrival taking care of our bag and parking our car. We had booked a superior room but I don't think it was superior, I even wondered had we been given the wrong room type by mistake. The room was tiny felt cramped don't even think it was a queen sized bed. As for the bathroom there were two tiles about to fall of the side of the bath. The house keeper arrived to do the turn down service at 6:30 did not even give me time to answer the door just barged in and said here handing me the chocolates!! So disappointed it was our wedding anniversary an thought I would book us a luxury hotel, do not feel that we got value for our money.",3,2014,04,27
204,No sleep,"We have just returned from a two night weekend stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Generally we were treated quite well and courteously by the staff and our deluxe premium room was clean and spacious. Only by reading other reviews do I now realise how big a problem the noise from the nightclub below must be. Unfortunately this overshadowed all the good points.

We stayed a Fri and Sat night, obviously busy for the club, and we're treated to thumping dance music late both nights. A patience-stretching 3:30am finish on the Sun a.m when the occupants spilled out onto the street below our window, who shouted, fought (and even got arrested) until well after 4am. I think some revellers were staying on our floor, lucky us, as loud conversations and lots of door banging went on in hallway for another half an hour.  I think around 5ish I fell asleep for an hour or so until the days work began for the maids (who's store cupboard was beside our door). We were offered to move rooms at 1:30 am, which we declined as my husband had felt unwell for most of the evening and didn't want to get up and move rooms at that time, and we were told it should be over at around 2:30.

If there are quiet rooms available to move people to in the middle of the night, why aren't we put in them in the first place? It would seem to make sense to give guests and staff as little grief as possible in this seemingly ongoing situation. If you value your sleep as much as I do I would not recommend a weekend here, not sure if weeknights are as bad. We have returned home feeling extremely tired and dreading Monday morning!  😞",3,2014,04,27
204,Amazing hotel!,"Great hotel in a great location! Staff is amazing! We approached the front desk just to ask if all rooms and beds were the same size as we got a queen size and my husband is super tall and Joanna took it upon herself to move us to a king size bed room free of charge! She went above and beyond and we were not really requesting an upgrade but just asking! Will definitely come back and recommend this hotel!

204,"Location, comfort, service","We only stayed one night at the Fitzwilliam on a mid-April weekend in a 5th floor room facing the back court yard.  From the minute we arrived outside the door of the hotel, bags in hand, we were helped by attentive, engaging and professional staff. It had been a long day traveling so being relieved of all concerns immediately upon entering was much appreciated. Standard but adequate size room for a downtown hotel with very comfortable queen bed and lovely, well equipped shower/ bath. It was quiet as well for sleeping. Breakfast offered a huge selection and abundance of food.  They also kept our luggage in storage while we visited Dublin the next day.  For its convenience, well trained and professional staff and for its comfort, we are very happy to have chosen this hotel. All downtown Dublin hotels are pricey and this is no exception. I give it a 4-star only because of the briefness of our visit.  Otherwise, wonderful place to stay in Dublin.",4,2014,04,25
204,???,"Extremely Disappointed. Ordered food in the bar that took ages to come. The experience was like Faulty Towers, saw one guest open his own bottle of wine as bar man was unable to open it.   Other guests did not receive expresso after asking for them three times.  Don't know how this is a five star hotel",1,2014,04,23
204,Easter break,"Wonderful hotel,Excellent staff. Our stay was enjoyable from start to finish. From our daughter coming home to an Easter egg on her bed to the bar staff making her her own apple martinis.  Staff couldn't have been more attentive to all our needs we couldn't have asked for more. Will definitely be back.",5,2014,04,22
204,High quality hotel in a great location,"Pro's - location, cleanliness, excellent staff
Could improve - room was very nice, had a balcony facing the park but ultimately it was pretty small. We kept tripping over each other. We also we're expecting a lot more from the full Irish breakfast, this was very ordinary and no better than my local cafe which is half the price. Was also expecting a grand dining room but instead it was a rather sterile cafe style room. ",4,2014,04,22
204,Great Hotel-excellent location.,"Great hotel. The staff members are so friendly especially the concierge. 

Close to shopping, trains, buses parks and the pubs and restaurants. 

The rooms are larger than we expected. The decor is beautiful. ",5,2014,04,21
204,Lovely hotel and staff needs some improvements,"I have just returned from a two night break here, I found the staff to be excellent and the rooms were lovely and very quiet which was great. 

The location was also excellent.

Unfortunately I found the wifi to be horrendous, not ideal when you are trying to work. Also I found the breakfast to be extremely overpriced and not of a good quality, 22€ for breakfast is to be blunt a rip off. Do yourself a favour and walk 2 mins into Grafton street and grab a better start to your day!",4,2014,04,19
204,Brilliant location,Lovely hotel in a fantastic location. Staff on Reception in particular were excellent.  Breakfast was very good. Rooms small but very well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable. Will be back!!,4,2014,04,14
204,Modern Design Hotel on St Stefens Green,"For the last two nights we choos the Fitzwillam in the Southern Centre very conveniant for Shopping and Museums. The Hotel is modern, stylish. We had a signature room, as most of the rooms with  no view to the Green of Saint Steffens, but very quiet facing to a courtyard.  Room was luxury, WiFi worked excellently, Small bathroom but very nicely decorated. Limited number of free TV channels. We did not try the Pay TV which is offered too. Tea and Coffee fascilities with good products. As our room was at the end of the aisle, long distance to the elevator. Excellent beds and high Quality duvets and Linnen.  Breakfast was excellent (one of the best in Ireland) we had, Buffet style , except of the very modern design of the Restuarant at Mezzanine Level  overlooking Lobby and reception. No tablecloth! Service was very friendly and very effective. Verry friendly staff, especially Concierges. Parking only € 10.--/day, cheeap for Dublin. 
Valet Parking  Staff is very attentive and assist you with all your Needs.",5,2014,04,11
204,Excellent stay,"This place comes highly recommended. Not the cheapest hotel- but for central Dublin far from the most expensive too.

Possibly the best I've ever been looked after by staff. The concierge had my case out of the taxi before I was out, check in was very pleasant and I was guided to my room and shown around the room by the receptionist. My case arrived 5 mins afterwards and having my 'bed turned down' with a couple of chocolates left on my pillow was a nice touch.

The rooms are perfectly adequate- although the curtains don't quite fit- and let light in- maybe something to consider in the summer months.

Avoid the 6th floor (there is no lift to it) if you aren't mobile or don't want to waste 15 mins in a morning with the trek down for breakfast and back.",4,2014,04,11
204,5 star hotel?,"Other may think this is a 5 star hotel, but it's not. More like a 3 star in a 5 star location. Rooms are small and cramp for 2 people. Dark rooms and halls. Food is mediocre. Breakfast overpriced. Mini bar fridge in room too small and too warmTelevision in room is too small. Lobby is small. Mystery charges on hotel bill. You have to check before you leave.",3,2014,04,10
204,"Nice hotel,great location, but get the right room","Booked a de- luxe room for three nights. Lovely room with a view of St Stephens Green, all as requested, until returning later to retire, we heard the noise, thump, thump...yes a night club two floors below. Not capable of sleep phoned reception who replied ""they would ask the night club to turn the music down"" Dohh!! Are you kidding. Not acceptable I replied ,would like a room change to some where quiet. This was done quickly and efficiently about midnight. A lesser room but quiet, until later in the night every plumbing noise, lift noise, extractor fan and lord knows what else started. Not much sleep so went to reception to sort it out. Happily a very efficient girl, (Egla) put is in an excellent quiet room and offered us a meal in compensation. So a good resolution to the problem. Pity it had to happen in the first place.

204,"Value, location & breakfast hard to beat","Not my first visit by any means but this hotel is consistently excellent. Central location, quiet & comfortable rooms, free wifi, an excellent shower and the best hotel hotel breakfast anywhere I've stayed.",5,2014,04,06
204,Top Quality hotel in the perfect location,Stayed here for one night last weekend. We got upgraded to a deluxe room looking over the park with a four poster bed! Room was fantastic. Staff were very professional and friendly. Location is fantastic right at the top of Grafton Street. Only negative I have is that I didn't find the pillows very comfortable. Would certainly stay here again.,4,2014,04,04
204,Best Hotel in Dublin,"Friendly staff, amazing location just off Grafton road and tram , quality services, very clean rooms.
I will definitely visit it again. 
I find it the best hotel in Dublin , highly recommend to everyone.

204,Ugh.  What a disappointment.,"What a disappointment.  Especially after staying at the Fitzwilliam Belfast before visiting this property.  We were saving this for the end of our Ireland and N. Ireland trip to celebrate my partner's birthday.  I reserved a deluxe room and was told by the front desk manager that we were upgraded to premium deluxe (a perk for booking directly according to their webpage).  Not sure if we were but the evening manager said our room was the deluxe we reserved.  This is fine  and it did come with a small balcony. We were on the 4th floor.  It was room 408 if I remember correctly.  No way would this qualify for a three star or even two stars by most standards.  Hallway leading to the room was shabby as the carpet was worn and old.  Inside, the there was thick chalking and black molds around the tub and sink/ bathroom floor.  The furniture in the room was well past it prime.  Bed was comfy though.  The biggest disappointment was how thin the walls were.  We tried to rest and heard our neighbor talking and their tv the whole time.  We went out for a few hours and came back to the same noise.  They were not excessively loud, the walls were just thin.  And when they were on their balcony talking and drinking, it sounded like they were in our room.

I went down and the evening manager said we can move to a third floor courtyard room.  I took a look and it was dark with little privacy as it faces neighboring rooms so we would have to have the curtains closed.  She also said she ""can't guarantee neighbor noise if we moved room"".  While true, not a comment I'd expect from a 5-star hotel manager.  We went out and when we returned, the neighbors werer still loud, this time with louder talking and stereo base going.  I couldnt find the air control so I called and the bellman came up.  He finally located one in another room.  When he turned it on, the individual air unit above the bed made a very loud rattling and humming.  Loud.  Even the bellman said it shouldn't sound that way.  He asked the duty manager to come up and she did.  Same woman, the evening duty manager.  She said that's how the individual air con sounds.  Which doesn't seem right.  I understand that air con hums.  But really, not an air con that rattles loudly like something was loose or  broken.  Worst it wasn't a constant rattling and humming so that we can use it as white noise to drown out the neighbors.  It turned on and off which made the rattling more disturbing.  She heard the neigbors and stereo and said there's nothing she can do about it.  Really, not what would be expected from a manager of a 5 star hotel.  She explained that all the rooms facing St Stephens have the individual air con unit.  And that the courtyard rooms are newer and have central air.  She suggested I take the courtyard room on the third floor.  I said I will and would like to check out the next day.  At this point, she offered a one bedroom on the 6th floor for the rest of our stay.  I was so put off about the noise, rattling air con, shabby furnishing, and how the night duty manager handled the situation that I declined the offer.  We did move for one night and checked out the next morning.  While the second room was better, we heard the kids and neighbors in the morning in our the second room.  The walls are thin folks.  

That said, I do have to give them credit for charging us only for the one night we stayed rather then the full four nights we had originally booked.  (We did book a non-cancellable rate on their website.)  

If you read my other reviews, I'm really not a hard to please traveler or a complainer.  TA have helped me select quality accomodations that resulted in great trips throughout.  This hotel just turned out to be a huge disappointment, especially as we timed our Ireland trip to celebrate my partner's birthday here.  It's day and night if compared to it's sister property in Belfast.  This hotel doesn't even compare to the inns we stayed at during this trip.  

I just don't want to have fellow TA users to have the same disappointment and hassle we experienced as I contribute and rely on TA for my travels.  Really, I wonder if I and the other reviewers stayed at different properties.",1,2014,04,02
204,5 star Concerige ,"I stayed here last weekend with my girlfriend. The staff in the hotel are extremely friendly and professional. The Concierge staff are a great asset to the hotel and I saw they way they interacted with other guests, nothing was too much for them. The hotel is in a great central location, jus 10 mins walk from o connell street and close so many good restaurants and trendy bars. Unfortunately the bar is not a 5 star standard. The menus are set in hard cardboard with visible tatters on the menus... I think the menus should be encased in soft leather. On the Friday night before we ate in Thortons we had a cocktail in the bar and there some type of ""house or Dance music playing"" I did not feel this was appropriate  music. But again, very friendly staff with great location. ",4,2014,04,01
204,Overnight Stay,Lovely comfortable hotel.  Staff extremely friendly and appeared to enjoy working at the hotel.  As it was a special occassion the hotel (without requesting it) upgraded us.  This was a lovely surprise and made the stay very special.  Hotel is very central.  I would without question reccomend this hotel.,5,2014,03,31
204,"great hotel, great location","such friendly staff! hallways are a little dim,  but the rooms are amazing.  they upgraded my room for free, without me even asking.  front facing rooms can be a little loud on a saturday night, but excellent quality hotel.  concierge was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and gave tailored advice for my very short dublin trip!",5,2014,03,31
204,Excellent special occasion,"We had a fantastic night away at this hotel. When I booked I mentioned on the reservation that it was our wedding anniversary. They upgraded our room and gave us lovely chocolates on check in. The room was gorgeous if a little small, valet parking for just €10 and location is amazing. I would highly recommend for a hassle free stay with high standards and very friendly staff.",5,2014,03,31
204,Incredible!,"We started our week in Ireland at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and it was just perfect!  Our flight got in at 8am and our room was all ready for us!  Additionally- when we returned after exploring the city that afternoon, a personal note and chocolates were waiting for us for our wedding anniversary!  This hotel is DEFINITELY worth every cent!",5,2014,03,30
204,Perfect location,I am a big fan of TripAdvisor and previous reviews of this hotel proved correct. Great location - we walked everywhere and room was good if a little less roomy than I had imagined. Car park under hotel at very reasonable rate. Staff were most helpful and professional at all times and breakfast I thought was great. ,4,2014,03,30
204,Lovely stay,"I stayed here in Nov 2013 with my wife, who had business at the RCS, which is right next door and therefore for us, it was a great location. The check-in was smooth, even though we came in at 1 am; the room was facing the inner-courtyard, presumably because we had asked for a quiet room. I don't know how old the property is, but the room was really well done inside - contemporary, smart. We did not dine at the hotel at all, but they were just generally super nice, even bringing up free steamed milk for my wife, who brings her own coffee everywhere. 

It is walkable to Temple Bar, Trinity College etc but at the same time away from all those. The park across the street was very nice, and probably will be nicer in the spring. The mall at the corner of the street (as you turn left from the main hotel entrance) had a comprehensive supermarket, if you need anything. 

The only shortcoming -and this is a nit, which is why I'd still give this hotel 5 stars - was the shower. It was very difficult to control the temperature, and the shower head pointed vertically downward but had such a large radius of spray that some of it would bounce off the wall and dribble down the side of the tub, eventually making the bathroom constantly wet.

That aside, loved the place and would stay again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,03,30
204,Avoid room 513,"We were looking forward to this trip for ages and there is no doubt that it is in a great location. 

But room 513 is very small for a premium price and our small window looks out to a concrete wall, we have to stretch to see the courtyard downstairs and there is a questionable stain in the toilet. 

We have spent most of the night awake because we are in the same corridor as a hen party and finally  the room seems to be next to the main water pipes as that kicked in at 6:30am as people started having showers.  ",1,2014,03,30
204,Luxury without the stuffiness,"We stayed one night on the 27th March and it was well worth the added expense. Great staff, beautiful rooms and immaculately kept. The hotel is very central, around 100 metres from the top of Grafton Street. We are looking forward to our next stay. ",5,2014,03,28
204,Lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for there nights in March and loved it! It's a beautiful hotel with very clean rooms, friendly staff and close proximity to city center. I would definitely recommend for anyone going to Dublin whether on business or for pleasure. ",5,2014,03,27
204,Good location near the walking street,Location is quite good near the park and the walking street. Nightlife center Temple Bar is also in walking distance - quiet and non-noisy surroundings. The level may not be anymore 5 Starlevel - but anyway quite ok. Breakfast was faraway from 5 Star breakfast and water was tapping in the rooms toiletroom.Doormen / barmen very polite.,4,2014,03,26
204,great stay and location,"Great location, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. Would stay again, will have to check out the restaurant the next time.  the lobby bar restaurant doesn't have a ton of appeal, but late night food service and drinks made up for all that!  Would recommend this hotel or stay in their other locations",5,2014,03,25
204,A lovely hotel in the best location,"We had a lovely stay in this very beautiful hotel. The location couldn't have been better, right in the thick of it. We had a superior room overlooking the park. As mentioned on here before, a bit noisy but only when the windows are open. And even the noise from the street wasn't too disturbing. The room is very nicely decorated and the bed of excellent quality.

Staff at the reception desk were welcoming and very accommodating. Breakfast was perhaps one of the best meals we had during the entire stay and especially the filter coffee: truly delicious. 

If there is one reason to go back to Dublin, it is the Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2014,03,25

A huge thank you to Joanna who really went out of we way to look after us. ",5,2014,03,24
204,"Beautiful, but expensive","Beautiful hotel, wonderful location.  Right across the street from St. Stephen's Green, and half a block from the shopping streets.  The staff was excellent.  I was able to request adjoining rooms online, so my children could be close.  There were even chocolates in the room on our arrival, and additional chocolates left on our pillows when we turned in for the night.  Staff was helpful in getting us a taxi to the airport, when we discovered that St. Patrick's Day had the bus routes out of wack.",5,2014,03,24
204,How to see Dublin,"A very comfortable, high quality hotel, with impeccable and attentive staff.  The concierges and bellmen are extremely friedly and helpful.  The rooms are very comfortable and clean.  The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing, shopping and restaurants in Dublin.
      
      ",5,2014,03,24
204,Just about perfect,"Couple in their 50s and adult daughter stayed a week at the Fitzwilliam over St.Patrick's Day.   We received the best service that we have ever experienced at a hotel.   The concierge desk was outstanding in all ways, attending to car rental, restaurant reservations, umbrellas, etc.   We had problems with our phones and safety deposit boxes (more on that below) and they apologized repeatedly, gave us drink vouchers, and did not charge for a breakfast or the mini bar.  All of the concierge and front desk staff knew us by our last name.  Wow is all we can say.

The hotel is beautifully designed with several associated high end bars and restaurants.  Room were reasonably sized, very good heat, hot water, high quality furnishings.  A desk lamp was needed, though.   Bathroom was bright, big, high quality fixtures.  Bed very comfortable.   Only downsides were the phone and safety deposit box; the phones never did work and looked at least a decade old.  Definitely in need of replacement.  One safety deposit box never worked, and another stopped working after 4 days,   As mentioned above, they were highly apologetic. 

The location is perfect.   Directly across the street was St. Stephen Green, a gorgeous park with flowers, swans, nooks and crannies with benches, great people watching.  100 feet away is basically the center of the city, bustling with people with two of the main roads turned into pedestrian walkways.   Street performers everywhere, shopping to meet anyone's interests.   A nicely done 4-story shopping complex is very close by for groceries, wine, drug store, etc.   This is definitely a walking city--no need for a car.  Uncountable restaurants and pubs.  Dublin is a very cosmopolitan city.

The Fitzwilliam is pricey but we would highly recommend it for its service, location, and quality.",5,2014,03,23
204,The Fitzwilliam brand is my new favorite ,"I travel to Ireland every March to visit my father's family in Northern Ireland and routinely stay at the Fitz in Belfast. This was my first stay with the Dublin location but it surpassed any experience I've had at the Belfast property. The hotel is absolutely spotless. The staff from the front desk to housekeeping are 5 star quality. The rooms are chic and decent in size. The location of this hotel cannot be beat. I often when describing this hotel to friends compare it to a W hotel here in the states. One thing they do not up sell is the size of the bathroom even in the basic room. The tub is a garden deep soaking tub which I appreciate when traveling. Surround sound was built in the bathroom as well. I stayed on the courtyard side and it was very quiet and relaxing. And to end you can usually get a pretty good deal
With the Fitz if you book ahead. ",5,2014,03,23
204,Location location location,"Stayed last last Saturday St Patricks weekend , ideal hotel very friendly staff . Room was ideal with a room terrace over looking the green .perfect  location to walk around Dublin and enjoy the sights & sounds  .",5,2014,03,22
204,WOW!,"I don't know where to begin, ok, I'll start from the beginning. When we pulled up to the hotel (amazing location) the street was crowded and there was no parking in front. While double parked and cars honking a nice man came out and said, ""don't worry, leave the car, go inside, I'll take care of the car and luggage"". The checkin was easy and the woman was very nice, I think she was a manger cause she wasn't wearing the uniform (which were cool looking). After checking us in she literally walked us to our room!! Who does that?!? I know this probably sounds like a fake review, but this happened. The room and hotel are beautifully designed, amazing decor with a lot of style (think boutique NYC hotel). 
It was Thursday night of St Patricks weekend and we didn't have a dinner reservation (yikes!). The concierge was amazing and wouldn't give up until he got us into a ""cool restaurant"". Actually, I don't even think we was a concierge, I think he was a doorman (younger guy, red hair). Anyway, after many phone calls to different places he got us into Fade Street Social (awesome place) and have us great recommendations for drinks after. 
Great job Fitzwilliams, Definitely going back! ",5,2014,03,22
204,Lovely rooms at the fitzwilliam hotel.,"We stayed here early January.  The hotel was very nice, the room was very comfortable, bathroom gorgeous, the tub was huge, perfect for 2. 

Service was excellent - concierge gave great directions and suggestions. Location was good too, but we were hassled a bit by aggressive local youth in front. 

We'd recommend tho. ",4,2014,03,20
204,Great stay great location!,Check in was smooth and quick. Found all staff to be extremely friendly and nice. Bed was to die for comfortable. Little touches were appreciated. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that. Overall we had a nice but short stay. Would defo stay again!,5,2014,03,20

204,Great location!,"Great experience at the Fitzwilliam.  It's in the perfect location - across from a small park and right next to a pedestrian walking street filled with stores and restaurants.  What our taxi driver referred to as ""the best pubs in town"" were just a short walk away.  We were on an upper floor with a small balcony - great views.  One word of caution - there was a bar/night club right next door and we could hear the crowd fairly late into the evening.  We would stay here again.",4,2014,03,19
204,Great location and good hotel,"This hotel is in a great city centre location, yet the rooms remain relatively quiet.   The rooms are also very comfortable, with some really nice touches - a superb tray of chocolates on arrival, for example.

The bar is more of a ""sports bar"" and the Citron restaurant is quite small, but both offer a nice atmosphere and decent food.  There's also a Michelin restaurant, but i didn't go there.

We got a really good deal to stay here and I was very pleasantly surprised how nice the hotel was. ",4,2014,03,19
204,Excellent,We stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel for 2 nights march 11th to 14th. The hotel staff are so helpful and friendly. We have stayed at hundreds of hotels all over the world mostly 5 star. I would say the staff at the Fitzwilliam are up there with the best.  ,5,2014,03,18
204,Courteous staff,"The front desk , concierge and door tenders really made this hotel feel warm and welcoming.  The room was large, with extra seating (albeit pretty uncomfortable); the ameneties were lovely.  The restaurant is very limited and the breakfast was not anything special.  Location next to the train is perfect, and also it is close to a large park and the shopping district. Overall,  a nice hotel and I would return.",4,2014,03,17
204,Avoid At All Costs,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam this week and I have to say in terms of the level of customer service and care, it is the worst experience I have ever had in my life, so much so it has left me deeply upset to the point where I felt I had to write this review - and I never complain. I work in the customer service industry myself and I know what it feels like so I am normally very forgiving and understanding, but not this time. 

I was in the hotel the day before I checked in with 2 friends who were staying there as we had a night out planned together, the idea was for me to meet up with them and have dinner before heading out. Immediately the staff were on guard with our presence as if I was trying to sneak my way in, despite the fact I had no bags or luggage with me. Whenever one of us emerged from the room there was a staff member not far away who were literally following our every move - and I mean literally. We would get into the elevator on whatever floor we were on and there would be a member of staff hovering around, when we were getting out of the elevator the staff member from the floor we were on would emerge from the stairs having ran up or down to track our movements. They would often make no secret of whispering behind each other's ears about us. It made us feel very uncomfortable and we could not be at ease and enjoy ourselves. At one point I was in the lobby waiting on the lift to come and when I turned around there was a concierge right behind me watching me and he pretended he was shuffling papers or something as I turned around. Their treatment of us was disgusting, when my friends returned that evening they had the same problems. 

When I checked in to the hotel the next day I was handed my room key and told to find my own way - however every other guest was being chaperoned to their rooms and shown where everything was inside. One of the receptionists made a cutting comment about my friends from the day before so I had the immediate impression I was once again being watched, despite being on my own. After finding my own way to my room I was left feeling so upset and uncomfortable with my being in the hotel I actually hid in my room for an hour before my friend shouted at me on the phone that I was a paying customer and did not deserve to be treated that way and to get out of my room. So I decided to venture down and book an appointment to get my nails done. Again immediately having the feeling that all eyes were on me. 

I got my nails done at the salon - only a file and paint for my night out, and I have to say it is the worst manicure I've ever had in my life, don't get me wrong the lady who did it was absolutely lovely and I couldn't fault her personality, she was fabulous but the job she did on my nails was terrible, so much so I wouldn't have paid for them if I had the guts to complain to management at the time. The lady in the salon is a trained psychotherapist and she told me she normally does the massage etc in the beauty salon so I don't think nails were really her thing to be honest. 

Later on in the day I was down in the lobby having a drink before my night out and there was a commotion of some sort going on outside the hotel, I made a casual chatty comment to the manager on duty as a polite way of making conversation and the man actually IGNORED me and turned his head away. I was so shocked and embarrassed. If I treated my customers like this I wouldn't have a job! 

Well this treatment carried on throughout my stay and it really ruined my last night in Dublin. When I was checking out the man behind the desk at reception gave me the entirely wrong directions to get to the Aircoach to the airport, I had to give up and flag down a taxi and pay €30 to get there so I didn't miss my flight. 

All in all I was left feeling like scum for want of a better word. I was treated throughout the entire visit like I was a lesser human being than other guests and like I didn't belong there. I paid a lot of money for my stay in the Fitzwilliam and it was one of the most upsetting experiences of my life, to be made to feel like you are not worthy of a stay in a hotel where you paid just as much as anybody else to be there. The fact that the staff did nothing to hide this either makes it even worse. I am in Dublin quite often and this was a beautiful hotel, had it not been for the staff I would have gladly stayed again, however their icy treatment of me has ensured I will never come back again. To treat other human beings this way is downright disgusting in my book. The customer may not always be right... but they are always the customer.",1,2014,03,14
204,Quiet hotel in the city centre,"Beautiful modern hotel opposite St Stephens. Remarkably quiet for such a central location.
Outstanding and helpful staff.
The only negative comment I could make is the lights in the room are a bit dim for reading and applying make up.",5,2014,03,14
204,very uncomfortable over night stay,"I booked a deluxe double room in this hotel for Tuesday the 11th of March as I was attending a VIP event in the City with a friend that night. Check in wasn't too bad and the lady was  polite and friendly. Our room was beautiful and I have no complaints with regards to the room at all. From the moment we checked in I noticed a female staff member who happened to be everywhere that we went. At fist I thought this was a coincidence but then she started speaking about us to other staff members and I clearly heard her telling a male staff member to watch us. I looked at my friend at this stage and said it must be down to the fact that somebody famous was staying in the same hotel and they were just being cautious which is perfectly normal. I would of said nothing had it ended there but it didn't. For the rest of the afternoon anywhere We went in the hotel we were being watched and spoken about. We returned to our rooms due to the uncomfortable feeling we had being down stairs. We headed off to our event and returned to the hotel at around 11.30pm and were asked to produce our hotel key before we were allowed in the hotel, this I think is perfectly normal and a very good security precaution. We sat in the lobby and asked for a pot of tea so we could relax for a moment as it had been a very long day. I then spotted the same female staff member from the morning time coming towards us, she spoke to a male staff member and he then came over and asked me for my room number and hotel key again! By this stage I had reached my limit and asked to speak to the manager. With in minutes the manager came over and I expressed my utter disbelief at the way we had been treated since we arrived and that it was totally unacceptable. He told me there was a high profile celebrity staying there and that was the only reason for what was happening and he had an idea who the staff were and would speak to them. As I explained to him I have been in this hotel several times for lunch with my cousin who is a model/TV presenter here in Ireland and she had highly recommended it for our overnight stay. I have also stayed in hotels before who had ""celebrities""  staying on the same nights and I have never been treated or made to feel like I was Tuesday night in the Fitzwilliam. The best way to describe it is being made to feel like you didn't belong there! I woke up the following morning and went down stairs only to receive the same treatment and felt so uncomfortable I checked out at 9.45am and left the hotel. I walked a short distance down Grafton street and met my cousin for brunch in a different hotel where I was treated as you should be when your in a hotel. I am so disappointed with the treatment from the staff during my 265.00 euro over night stay. Regardless of who was staying in the hotel they should still value their customers  and everybody should be made to feel welcome and comfortable when they are staying in a hotel and certainly never have to over hear staff member talking about you. And may I just point out that I am a mature married mother of two who works in event management not a 18 year old night clubber who just fell in off the street! I can not express my disappointment enough especially as myself and my husband were going to stay there in April for our 8th wedding anniversary. I can only hope for other travellers that the staff were all slightly on edge due to who was staying there and that they have all returned to normal today.",2,2014,03,13
204,overnight stay for concert,"My daughter and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam over night on Sunday 9 March.  We had a fabulous experience in the Fitzwilliam.  The staff were so personable, friendly and nice, and couldn't not do enough for us.  As my daughter is young we were not in any bars or restaurants, but going on what we experienced with the staff and the accommodation, I have no doubt that they are top class also.  I live in Ireland and travel to Dublin a few times a year, and have stayed in many Dublin hotels, and I will definitely be going back to the Fitzwilliam.  Location also second to none!!!",5,2014,03,12
204,Full marks for this hotel!!!,"Our stay at the Fitzwilliam was wonderful. We visit a lot of hotels from time to time but this hotel is at the top of our list for relaxation and comfort, customer service and fabulous food! We will be back
      ",5,2014,03,11
204,Excellent,One of the best hotels in Dublin. Staff are brilliant and very friendly! Rooms are comfortable and beautiful. Breakfast was excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely be back in the future!,5,2014,03,11
204,Another great stay,"We stayed this past weekend in the Fitzwilliam,going down for the Six nations rugby match, it was our second visit to this hotel. It was another enjoyable experience. The staff cannot do enough for you, from being personally shown to your room on arrival, the concierge seeking you out on departure to see if you need a taxi, it's little things like this that make all the difference.
 Even the staff in the bar impressed, the girl who served us on Friday night and Saturday was so friendly and welcoming (unfortunately I can't remember her name, a young dark haired girl). We stayed in one of the rooms on the second floor overlooking the courtyard, it was a nice room, but didn't compare with the room overlooking the green we had on our last visit, but I think Beyonce and her entourage had taken over the upper floors during our visit.
The location of the hotel is second to none. I can't wait until my next visit to the Fitzwilliam, Highly recommended.",5,2014,03,10
204,not five star experience,"Well where to begin, when booking our stay on the hotel website, we phoned the Fitzwilliam after to make sure our booking was complete, the lady I spoke with said she would phone me back when she received the booking, (I thought her name was Caitriona, but the hotel said it was Maria ), well she did phone me back and took great time with me as I had explained that recently good recommended  hotels were slipping and these packages that were offered seemed to be the worst rooms in hotels, so I asked for a nice room, Maria was lovely and told me about the rooms that were available, so we decided on a room to the front of the green, Maria did explain about the noise, (which by the way was not bad at all) I did request a room with two double beds as I was taking my mum which I was told would be no problem that she would give us a family room with two large beds.

When we arrived to check in the receptionist Manuel was giving us a twin room two single beds in the back of the hotel, I explained my phone call with Maria, but he was clearly confused and did not know how to deal with the situation, we asked him questions and he just did not answer us, so finally when we were starting to get some what annoyed and about to leave, he said he had a deluxe room available facing the green he would up- grade us to, at no extra cost( €150 extra if paying ) he showed us to the room which I have to say was a standard double room, definitely not the five star as it states on website This five star environment will provide you with a relaxing and stylish retreat for your stay in Dublin ... 
Great location if you want to explore the city, lovely staff, dinner menu very limited if you on a package, dinner ok not what you would expect from five star, breakfast was cold on both mornings, the first morning we did not say anything but the second morning we did, on our second day we put the clean our room sign on the door in the morning but when we returned late that evening our room was not cleaned so we had to ring looking for towels, toiletries etc,  overall very disappointed with our stay,",3,2014,03,10
204,"Great location, stylish & modern","We stayed here over New Year. The hotel is in a fantastic location, right on St Stephen's Green and adjacent to Grafton Street, just a stone's throw from many great bars, restaurants, shops and tourist attractions.

The hotel itself is modern, stylish and welcoming. All staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone was ready with a smile and friendly greeting.

The bar situated beside the reception was great. Good food, lovely staff and fabulous chocolate martinis! Always a bonus. The bar serves food throughout the day and is a good choice for a later breakfast if you have missed the restaurant breakfast due to over-indulging in Guinness the night before!

The room itself was very chic, with  a stylish and practical window seat/table arrangement.
However, a major disappointment (and for me, a loss of the 5th star) was the bathroom. It was small, but this is not the reason - we have stayed at other hotels with similar sized bathroom have have been both stylish and functional (Hotel Indigo in Glasgow for one). The poor tiling, leaking bath tap, mouldy grout & silicone, shower curtain (in a 5 star hotel?!) and general poor design and lack of maintenance resulted in a less than luxurious bathing experience. It was particularly incongruous with the modern and stylish bedroom and the plush carpet in the hallways. The shower itself was really powerful (perhaps too much?) and combined with the flimsy curtain, this was most likely the cause of the previous water damage. It was in stark contrast to the high standard of the rest of the hotel.

Overall, I would stay here again - the location, staff and (most of) the design make the hotel a great choice. However, I can only hope they are re-modelling the bathrooms before my next visit!",4,2014,03,09
204,"Great hotel, so friendly!","I stayed here in March of 2014. Great location, beautiful hotel, very comfortable, and beautiful rooms and with super comfy beds and a variety of pillows (I love that). And they also provide a nice big white cotton robe!

The staff is incredibly friendly and nice. My travel agent booked me in the wrong day (thanks), but the hotel made it all better with very little fuss.

I really can't find anything negative to say - if I had to say something, I think they need new big bath towels because they are starting to feel a bit thin - but if this is the worst thing about this hotel, then there is nothing wrong with this hotel.  I do wish they had a mini-fridge for personal use so I could put in my lovely gluten-free food-neurotic stuff :)

My favorite moment was getting into the cab, and the doorman was getting me a cab - as I left, I guess I dropped my sunglass cloth inside the hotel, and he actually saw it and rushed back to give it to me! It's those little things that make an impression of the type of people who work at a hotel. 

Would definitely stay here again when I am back in Dublin.",5,2014,03,08
204,Reasonable and decadent,"I am just astonished that such a lovely hotel is found in such a perfect location, and the price was very reasonable too! Hotel room was very modern in design, the bath was just luxurious, staff were so friendly. Will stay again for sure!",5,2014,03,07
204,Wonderful fabulous !!!,"I booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a party of 7 ladies to celebrate a 70th birthday . Having stayed there previously I was aware that the hotel standard was very high and it would be the ideal venue for a special treat. Although we could have chosen a less expensive hotel, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for and I would have no hesitation in paying that bit extra as the service is second to none. The location of the hotel is also perfect ,being as central as you can get for the main shopping areas, Dublin sights and restaurants & nightlife.  From the moment you arrive at the hotel you are treated like royalty. The staff make you feel so special and cannot do enough for you. After pulling up outside the door , we were greeted by the welcoming smile of Jarko, who could not  have been more accommodating and helpful. Special thanks to him as being a party of 7 ladies who had also been shopping in the morning we had a considerable amount of  luggage! We had 3rooms booked and initially we did have a issue with one of the rooms as we were not aware that the “third” bed was a pull out couch. However, what was initially an issue was resolved quickly and efficiently by Cora Caples. Cora was most helpful and actually exceeded our expectations with how she dealt with our complaint. This was no mean feat, as we were expecting very high standards, especially as one of the party is a Hotel Manager herself. Thank you Cora and Jarko for making our stay a very memorable occasion and giving us a lot to talk about on the way home in a very positive way.  We had such a fabulous stay that I have this morning booked the same party of 7 for another stay in November for another 70th birthday. We are so looking forward to experiencing the wonderful hospitality again, not forgetting to mention the fantastic breakfast which again was served to us by staff who were friendly, welcoming and make you feel that nothing is too much to satisfy their guests. Well done to everyone and thank you. There are enough stars to rate our stay. Fantastic.  ",5,2014,03,03
204,"Excellent Hotel, Location, Staff and Outstanding Customer Service!","Stayed at the hotel for two nights (Friday and Saturday Night) on a visit to Dublin having stayed in the hotel before I was aware of what to expect thou this time I was just overwhelmed by the excellence in every department, We arrived at 1am Friday Morning and had a hassle free check in to a very well-appointed deluxe room with nothing to fault. Breakfast was great plentiful and the staff where very attentive. Louiz from the night staff was simply excellent his customer service is brilliant and always greats you with a smile, the highlight of my stay was his attention to detail and eagerness to help at all times nothing was too much.",5,2014,03,02
204,Stayed here in Jan '14,"Stayed here at the end of Jan 2014.

We booked the hotel only the night before we went and we rang the hotel directly to get a better price.  They definitely beat any price that was available on all the last minute hotel booking websites so I would definitely recommend trying this if you find yourself in a similar position.

Pros:  hotel itself is beautiful just as you'd expect from a (city centre) 5 star hotel.  The location is perfect if you're aiming for South Dublin City interests. Restaurants, shopping etc all within walking distance.
Parking is a big pro for this hotel, in my opinion. For 10E we parked for 2 days at the hotel and just walked to where we needed. 

Cons: breakfast was not good... for a 5 star hotel I definitely expected (and have experienced) better in other hotels.  Not much choice really which would normally be fine but if your'e going to offer such a limited breakfast menu it really needs to be cooked a lot better.  My partner had sausages/bacon that was well over cooked.  The toast was served about 10 mins before the hot breakfast ever arrived.
If your'e just after a continental breakfast - it's OK but comparable to 4 star hotel quality. 

The other thing that caused me to rate this hotel lower was the heat in the bedroom. Though it was the end of January and temperatures were cold enough the bedroom was roasting even with the air con turned on.  We rang reception and they suggested turning off the radiator which we did but maybe it was the heat from the rooms next to us but really, really too warm.

For a 5 star modern hotel I would have expected a separate bath and shower in the bathroom, but there is only a bath tub in a relatively small bathroom.",4,2014,03,02
204,Fitzwilliam,Right on St Stephens Green and very central to Grafton Street. Staff were great. They worked hard to get me the type of room I needed and were very helpful. The breakfast was really good! Was just disappointed I didnt have time to avail of all of the hotel had to offer.,5,2014,03,02
204,As fabulous as ever,"I recently stayed twice at this wonderful hotel. From the welcoming reception, to the efficient staff, to the perfect room. The location is perfect for all needs. This is definitely my go to hotel in Dublin and I hope to be back many more times. ",5,2014,03,01
204,48 hours in Dublin,The Fitzwilliam Hotel was perfectly located for our visit and did not disappoint on any level.A problem with the mini bar and air conditioning was sorted out efficiently.The Full Irish breakfast is superb although you will need an hour to lie down after it.,5,2014,03,01
204,Dublin Visit,"What  lovely friendly staff they could not do enough  to help  found where I needed to be, got me there in time and checked route for me and the friendly  welcome from the receptionist when I arrived was lovely .I would stay there again when I come to Dublin but next time it would be nice to include breakfast as this I found was a little costly but overall  a great central hotel with fab front of house staff aiming to come back at easter if they have room for me ",5,2014,03,01
204,Excellent location,Really lovely hotel. Room was funky but yet cosy. Room was slightly small but it is to be expected for such a centrally located hotel. It was surprisingly peaceful stay considering the location. Only let down (and it is a small thing) was quality of tile patch up job in the bathroom and towels that had seen better days. ,4,2014,02,24
204,Location and quality,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for two days, mid-week.  The B&B accommodation was quite competitive, given the quality of the hotel and its location.  Step out of the front door, cross the street and you are at the end of the Luas Green Line (Charlemont, Dundrum, Sandyford, Brides Glen).  Walk a few more paces and you in St Stephen's Green.  Out the front door, turn left, walk 1 minute and you are in Grafton Street.  The room was large, very clean and well apportioned with all the usual facilities.  Breakfast was excellent in the restaurant with a good selection available.  If you are like me, you will ask for the tea/coffee and toast to be held back until your hot food arrives!  Check-in and check-out were seamless.  We parked in the underground hotel car park for €10 per day.  I know where I will be staying on my next Dublin visit!",5,2014,02,23
204,Luxury,"Luxury all the way  for my birthday .I spent my birthday with family and friends at the Fitzwilliam. we had a beautiful room overlooking st Stevens green the birthday meal was excellent  fantastic service at all times, staff very well trained in customer care will be back again",5,2014,02,21
204,Great location and experienced staff,"Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights last December. Great location, right in the city centre, few steps from Grafton street, Trinity etc. Plenty of places to visit. 
The room was very cosy, quiet and clean.
I was  looked after very well. ""Good night"" chocolate was a nice surprise.",5,2014,02,18
204,an excellent Dubin hotel,"Second time staying at The Fitzwilliam.  Stayed for 5 nights.  People working there are truly friendly and helpful, both in the hotel and at all three restaurants. Would definitely stay there again when in Dublin.

Be sure to ask for a non-smoking floor if that is important to you.
      ",5,2014,02,18
204,Great hotel and helpful staff,"I work for a large corporation and am constantly on the lookout for great hotels for our off-sites. We used the Fitzwilliam for a 2 day event and we couldn't praise it high enough. My colleagues were looked after so well, staff couldn't be more genuinely helpful and the hotel itself is outstanding. The rooms are so chic and fresh, and everyone commented on the sleek décor. The food and presentation was spot on. In the run up to the meeting, the staff in reservations could not have been more helpful (or patient - I had so many questions, given the top level execs who were going to be in attendance). I'd recommend this hotel highly - whether it's business or pleasure, it's a great place to stay. A credit to Dublin city, and the hospitality industry in general!",5,2014,02,17
204,Lovely hotel - fantastic location,"Stayed for four nights in July 2013. The hotel is lovely, but the location is fantastic. We were staying with our 1 1/2 year old son, so it was really nice to be able to take a 30-second walk across to St Stephens Green to dander about rather than being stuck in the hotel, particularly useful first thing in the morning when we were waiting on each other to get ready. Again, it's a very short walk to the shopping areas.

Staff were friendly and helpful, e.g. parking the car for us on arrival.

Food was good - we ate in the hotel bar two evenings and really enjoyed it.

Rooms aren't huge or particularly plush, but they are clean and comfortable.

Hope to be back soon.",4,2014,02,16
204,Overpriced.,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer, the staff and service are generally 5 star but the room was not as expected. Having booked as a post Christmas treat from my husband we were quite disappointed. The room was small and a bit worn around the edges.  Again like the previous reviewer we had a problem on our final morning with the water temperature which we reported to reception. Unfortunately after being asked several times were we sure we had let it run long enough (we had) it was not rectified in a timely manner and resulted in icy cold showers for both of us. Reception did apologize on check out and gave us a voucher which could be used on our next visit. This is a bit of a cop out as it is unlikely if we do decide to spend that amount of money again we will be back here. That said location is perfect if you can overlook some minor flaws and the price tag.",3,2014,02,13
204,5 star service but not 5 star hotel,"We stayed here for a weekend with friends. To say we were underwhelmed would be an understatement. It is listed as a 5 star hotel but there is little to merit this. 
The staff and service are definitely 5 star. I requested feather free room and this was noted which was appreciated. I also asked that my husbands 40th be acknowledged but it wasn't. Not a big deal. 
All staff we met were very polite, welcoming, friendly & efficient. The servicing of the room twice daily was to a very high standard. 
However, the room was very small and very ordinary for a 5 star hotel. The queen size bed was small. But most disappointing was the bathroom. The water temperature was very hard to regulate in the shower. One minute a lovely warm shower, next minute icy cold. Also the water somehow poured onto the floor, not sure how. But stepping out onto a soaking bath mat was not pleasant. 
We paid a significant nightly rate, as it was a birthday treat & a premium rugby weekend and unfortunately I did not feel the Fitzwilliam lived up to it. There is no ""wow"" factor when you walk in. There is no atmosphere in the very quiet bar. 
The staff, service & location make this a very good choice but not a 5 star choice. ",3,2014,02,10
204,A genuine 5* hotel,"Could not fault this hotel one bit.  

Any minor issues, the concierge team went more than out of their way to address and go beyond what was needed. 

Would deffinately stay again. 

After staying in many 5*hotels around the world that do not deserve the rating, it is very refreshing to stay in places that really do deserve the status.

Thanks

Paddy & Natalie",5,2014,02,10
204,"John, the  Best Manager in the World!","We arrived at the hotel past midnight , the Chef has left for the night....  I was starving .... John, the Manager at the time, went out of his way (because it was not in the menu), to serve me the best and freshest shrimp cocktail in the world (no salt!, because most hotels and restaurants actually kill the food with too much salt! They kill me too! Ugh!). Hence,  I was able to savor the natural sweetness of the shrimps in its purest state, as if just caught from the ocean! He served it with a mild tomato based sauce that has a slight fruity tinge to it.  Whatever it was, it was  so delicious!  Please put that on your menu?

John, Thank you so much again, from the bottom of my heart!  I hope to see you again very soon!  :)***",5,2014,02,05
204,Very enjoyable stay will return,"Location excellent, service great. Room was a twin no space between the beds,  but the decor was lovely, room was spotless, breakfast was lovely. Wil return. Chocolates on the pillow a nice touch, great quality shampoo etc",5,2014,02,04
204,So glad we chose this hotel for our first trip to Dublin!,"I spent hours reading reviews on Trip Advisor to select the right hotel for my husband and I, as it was our first trip to Ireland and am so glad I settled on The Fitzwilliam. When we travel we definitely don't like to cut corners on our accommodations. The Fitzwiliam did not disappoint.

We arrived from the US on early Saturday morning, January 20th. Arriving at the hotel around 10:00 we were expecting to have to wait to check in. Instead, smiling Brid (pronounced ""Breed,"" short for Bridget) literally showed us to our room immediately. When I noticed the bed looked more like a queen than the king size I had booked, without hesitation she switched us to a room at the back of the hotel with a king sized bed. That room was SO QUIET that after walking to Brawleys' for breakfast we returned to the room and slept until about 5:00. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room, thankfully, had its own thermostat. I had read other reviews about hotels in Dublin (5 star) being too warm and having no temperature control so we appreciated this.

The shower/tub was excellent. Good water pressure, great towels, robes and slippers. The breakfast buffet was excellent quality and prompt service. 

Our trip was planned for three nights in Dublin before moving onto Belfast and we would be returning to Dublin for the last two nights. Since I didn't know what to expect at The Fitzwilliam, I had only booked it for the first three nights. While we were out in the city the first few nights, we stopped by some of the other hotels I had considered staying at, but as far as cost, location, friendliness, room (yes, we even inspected rooms at the other hotels) we just couldn't beat The Fitzwilliam, so we booked it for the final two nights before we left, requesting the same room upon return (552) as it was so quiet. Checked back in when we returned and, as promised, they had reserved that room for us.

We spent five days in Dublin, getting to know the city and found The Fitzwilliam to be ideally located. Right on St Stephen's Green, it is in walking distance to The Temple Bar District and other attractions, and a short cab ride to just about anywhere else we wanted to go.",5,2014,02,01
204,Fantastic!,"We stayed in this hotel last weekend. Everything about our stay was fantastic! Beautiful room with lovely décor. When we arrived classical music was paying in our room and chocolates were left out which we felt were lovely touches! The room was lovely and warm, beds so comfortable, and room was very quiet. Breakfast was fantastic- one of the best in the hotels we have stayed in. Staff were fantastic- so friendly and helpful. An added bonus was that breakfast was served until 12 o' clock- very welcome of a Sunday morning!! This is our third time staying here. We have stayed in many other hotels in Dublin, but this is the best hotel in the area, in our experience. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,02,01
204,"Sadly, not what it used to be","We loved this hotel.If we were planning a special break this was our preferred hotel by a distance. Unfortunately on our last stay 28th Dec '13 we were very disappointed. Although the staff were excellent as always the room (228) was not good. We could hear the person next door as if he were in our bathroom. Coughs, phone message alerts, general movement etc were crystal clear. The room looked like it needed updated also. The bathroom had badly cracked tiles & grout missing in places. At breakfast my wife's breakfast arrived promptly however she was long finished before mine arrived with a simple ""sorry"". We passed on our concerns the following morning to reception & they give us free parking in compensation.
At £180 a night I expect better. As we have a baby & one on the way, this was planned to be a special night away just the two of us. We were looking forward to a good nights sleep in a beautiful room and a stress-free breakfast but we were let down on all counts. Such a shame as we never had any problems before here.",2,2014,02,01
204,First Class!,"Stayed in this hotel for the weekend just past.  To our surprise we were given a room upgrade as a result of our stay being due to my husband's birthday celebration, lovely comfortable room with balcony overlooking st stephens green, really appreciated.   
Staff pleasant and helpful at all times. Good parking facility available.",5,2014,01,29
204,Disappointed,"We stayed at this hotel in August 2013. Unfortunately we were let down badly both by the quality of rooms but more importantly the way we were received at check-in.

I work as a medic and had just worked a 14 hour night shift before arriving at the hotel at 12:30pm. My colleague politely asked check-in staff whether they could possibly accommodate us by allowing me to check in early to sleep in one of our rooms despite check-in being 2pm. We were greeted with a sigh and gruffly reminded that check-in was 2pm - we wouldn't have enquired had we not known this but were asking a favour from a 5 star hotel. This was followed by a lengthy wait in which the receptionist reluctantly sought a room  and ignored us. I could only laugh to myself at the absurdity and appalling manner in which the staff member conducted herself - perhaps the service industry was not her calling. A minor inconvenience but I think unacceptable behaviour when we were paying £180/night/room. I realise that this should be viewed as a subjective comment but I cannot emphasise how rudely we were treated. I accept this in rare occasions at 3/4 star locations but I think a 5 star hotel should never speak to guests in this manner. 

A smaller matter but again no less important were the rooms. The carpet felt like I was walking on plastic bags possibly betraying a previous serious spillage and the view was of a concrete garden and other parts of the hotel despite being this hotel being situated over St Stephen's green. 

I felt short changed by the Fitzwilliam Dublin for the money we paid. It is certainly not 5 star in service and fell short in the room décor. I have had the pleasure of staying at other 5 star hotels in Dublin and while I would possibly pay £120 to stay at the Fitzwilliam, if you want a true 5 Star experience stay at the Westbury off nearby Grafton St. or The Marker at the Bord Gas Theatre - 5 mins by Taxi from Dublin City Centre.",3,2014,01,28
204,Fantastic experience.,"From the moment I checked in everything went to perfection with the friendliest employee at the reception ( I think her name was Maisa), I had previously told them it was my partner's birthday with that in mind they treated us with an upgrade and upon entry to the room there was a happy birthday sign handcrafted with chocolate and a note to thank us for spending the special occasion with them. The room was spacious and  the view from the balcony looking onto Stephen's Green was stunning and it showed me a side to my city I had never seen before. I highly, highly recommend this hotel. Oh and it also had the most powerful rejuvenating shower I have ever experienced.",5,2014,01,27
204,Super experience in the heart of Dublin,"Amazing hotel right in the heart of Dublin. The staff are what make the hotel really special, they were lovely from before we even stepped in the door, as booking was made so easy by their quick response to all sorts of questions.

Would highly recommend anyone to stay there, even though it's not the cheapest it is worth it. Also, make sure you enjoy a cocktail in the bar, they're special! The whiskey sour especially is one to try!",5,2014,01,27
204,"Great hotel, great location.","I am a hotel snob. The Fitzwilliam lived up to my  standards. Great central location, safe area, can walk to nearly everything from here, clean facilities and room, no funky smells. Rooms are not as big as American standards, but European and UK hotel rooms rarely are. Staff was courteous and helpful. Overall, if I came back to Dublin, I would stay here again.",4,2014,01,26
204,Good 4 star,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam when it first opened & again last month. It was a last resort due to a big rugby game that weekend. As I 5 star it was distinctly unimpressive. The bar is internal so there's no outlook ( as is in the Shelbourne) we upgraded our room & found it to be no bigger than the standard size of other nearby 3 star accommodation. Breakfast was fine if you had a deal, greatly overpriced as a stand alone buy there are so many alternatives locally.If you want a St Stephens Green 5 star experience the Merrion & are the Shelbourne are your only real choices.",4,2014,01,24
204,Wonderful!,"It's taken me a while to get to this review ... we visited Dublin in late August ... at the end of a two week walk in the Dingle Bay/Killarney region.  The Fitzwilliam Hotel was wonderful ... the rooms are small, but nicely appointed with lovely bathrooms.  The staff was very friendly, always ready to give directions, advice or a helping hand.  The location is ideal for walking the beautiful city of Dublin [just across from St. Stephen's Green].  We especially loved the bar & friendly staff.  We will definitely revisit.",5,2014,01,23
204,Quite possibly the best hotel i've stayed in,"Just came back from my first Europe trip and stayed in the Fitzwilliam in Dublin for 2 nights. It's hard to know where to start- the location of the hotel is central to everything (close to beautiful Stephens green), the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the breakfast is extensive and delicious- as for the lunch i had in the hotel one day- the best risotto i've ever had (parmesan and truffle)! Like said in other reviews the bedrooms are well equipped and very modern, have a great shower/bath and the cleaning staff do an incredible job. The only bad thing? Not getting to spend more time there! Will definitely be returning.",5,2014,01,22
204,overnight stay,The hotel is in a great location just beside St Stephens Green and a short walk to  Grafften Street. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. The hotel is very modern and is kept to a high standard. No complaints.,5,2014,01,20
204,My Favorite Dublin Hotel,"I've stayed at the Fitzwilliam twice in the past year, and I must say that it is an outstanding hotel.  The service is absolutely stellar, the rooms are well appointed and very comfortable, and the breakfast is extremely good.",5,2014,01,17
204,Great Hotel,"A modern stylish hotel in a great location on St Stephens Green, Dublin.  I booked with the hotel web site which was just as well priced as the 'discount' sites.  On arrival we were upgraded to a beautiful deluxe room with a 4 poster bed, sitting area and a balcony overlooking the green, a very nice gesture.  The staff at all levels were very welcoming, polite and helpful.  Parking is simple, just park the car at the front and staff will take it to the underground on site car park ready for an easy departure. The 10 euro parking fee is good value for Dublin. The Inn on the Green pub in the hotel is modern and comfortable and is sympatethic to to the hotel style.  Breakfast was great, the full Irish hard to pass but if you had to there was plenty of choice of fresh fruits, yoghourt, cereals, cheese and breads.  On top of all that the location is perfect for walking access to the bars, restaurants and attractions of central Dublin.  There is even a top rated Michelin star restaurant on site, Thorntons........maybe next time!",5,2014,01,17
204,Great location,"Good hotel with a very central location overlooking St. Stephen's Green.  Staff were very friendly, courteous, helpful and very welcoming.  Good staff add to the experience of enjoying the hotel.  Rooms are good with very comfortable beds.  There is no stand alone shower so you must request a bath mat if you wish to shower in the bath.  Tea/Coffee making facilities, iron/ironing board and hairdryer available.  Would return and would recommend this hotel.",4,2014,01,17
204,Perfect accommodations in Dublin - good value,We had a really nice stay at this hotel and thought it represented a very good value relative to other places in town.  The rooms were great and the hotel is very conveniently located.  We will definitely return here if back in Dublin.,5,2014,01,16
204,Good Hotel & central,"Wonderfully located on St Stevens Green , near everything in Dublin. Very comfortable rooms with TV , Mini bar & fridge , kettle & coffee & tea making facilities. Just a pity that there is no stand alone shower , one has to step into a rather deep bath to shower.. The staff very helpful. A delightful bar and an excellent restaurant complement to Hotel very well.",4,2014,01,14
204,Brilliant hotel and good value,Great hotel in an excellent location. Rooms tastefully decorated with quality fittings and food and drink were delicious. Hotel staff were courteous and welcoming and made the whole stay faultless. I would recommend!,5,2014,01,09
204,A wonderful expiernce,"I had the pleasure to stay in the Fitzwilliam in November and I must say it was a fantastic experience.  The property is warm and beyond comfortable, the location is fabulous and the people who work there are some of the best I've had the pleasure to experience.  I could not me more delighted in referring people to this hotel as they will only love me for it.  I simply can't wait to go back and spend more time.",5,2014,01,08
204,Lovely weekend break,"My husband and I are very much the independent traveller types and when we go on city breaks we often like to 'live like the locals' and rent an apartment, we decided on this occasion to treat ourselves to a hotel in Dublin and managed to find the Fitzwilliam at a pretty good price considering it's location and star rating.

I'll start by saying we had a fab trip, but the hotel is not like the 5 stars it bears but more like a good 4 star hotel. The lobby was really stylish and the rooms also good looking with a view onto a peaceful courtyard although a teeny bit tatty round the edges i.e. a few chips on some of the woodwork etc. The toiletries could have been a bit fancier too :) The bed was extremely comfortable.

There is a spa but we didn't have the time to try it out.

The location is excellent and pretty much all of the bits of Dublin you might want to see are within walking, and probably stumbling (it is Dublin after all) distance including the area around Dame Street which had lots of nice and unpretentious places to eat.

Staff were all helpful and super friendly but not overbearing and we ate in the restaurant one night and despite it being completely deserted and having as much atmosphere as a doctors waiting room the food was actually delicious.

Overall I'd say this is a good 4 Star hotel at a 4 Star price; not truly luxurious but an excellent choice and we enjoyed it very much.",4,2014,01,08
204,honeymoon hotel,"arrived at lunch time just before check in, was shown to the bar and given complimentary prosecco, bar manager was great and the bar staff all lovely.
shown to our room which was nice and over looked the green, tho really not sure the room was worth the money and we were told we'd been upgraded as it was our honeymoon, wudnt have wanted to seen the room if wasnt. above a nightclub which played loud music to the early hours, on check our we were not asked if we enjoyed our stay and i am annoyed i never ementioned the noise. ate in thorntons, unreal.",4,2014,01,06
204,Wonderful New years trip,"We stayed six nights at the Fitzwilliam over the New Year's Holiday. It was an anniversary trip with friends and family, so we had a total of six rooms. The service was spectacular and we used the concierge for all arrangements both before our arrival and during our stay. The rooms were all lovely, the breakfast delicious and the bar a welcoming spot to warm up after a day of sightseeing. I would totally recommend the hotel for its location, accommodations , and spectacular service. Such a convenient spot for visiting all the attractions in Dublin. Don't miss the Beatty museum while there!",5,2014,01,05
204,Couples weekend in Dublin,"I spent a weekend at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by super friendly staff who couldn't do enough to help us. The concierge Patrick is great - he booked our restaurant for us that evening. The bed is the most comfortable I have ever slept in, the room was really quiet, and the location is just the best - walking distance to all the major sites. The only let down (and the reason I have not scored the hotel as ""Excellent"") is that on checking out the concierge suggested we collect our car from the car park ourselves as ""it would be easier"". We were annoyed at this because we paid EUR 20 for valet parking!! And it certainly wasn't easier for us as we had to search for our car spot dragging our bags with us. Also, not knowing Dublin, when we exited the car park we hadn't a clue where we were. Other than that, I would definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam.",4,2014,01,04
204,New Year,"The staff were a great credit to the stay. From concierge to reception to room cleaning : very well looked after. Recommend trying the SPA for excellent pampering. Hotel location terrific. Shops , hop-on hop-off , park , public transport. All in all recommended.",5,2014,01,04
204,Central Dublin Gem,"Fabulous hotel from which to explore Dublin for New Year's Eve 2013/2014.
Very helpful and friendly staff. Wonderful location at bottom of Grafton Street on St Stephen's Green. Adjacent to Stephen's Green shopping centre.

204,"fitzwilliam , dublin","hotel facilities were great, upgraded on arrival , food was excellent . all staff were very helpful and friendly.everything in our room was perfect,good central location will definately be staying here again.",5,2014,01,03
204,New Year's Eve 2013,"We have stayed in this hotel on a number of occasions and would highly recommend it due to the helpfulness and attitude of the staff at every level. The rooms are spotlessly clean with all the mod cons, the foyer is modern and trendy with a relaxed atmosphere, the hotel is ideally situated and there is a secure car-park which is rare in city centre hotels.",5,2014,01,03
204,It's the little things...,"Overall our stay in The Fitzwilliam was enjoyable but was let down by poor maintenance in one of the pricier rooms and the attitude of one member of the bar staff. 

The gentlemen on reception greeted us warmly and was very helpful with both check in and out. His name was Jonathan if memory serves and he was a credit to the hotel. 

The room, number 303 could benefit from a deep clean and maintenance.  There was mould growing on the roof of the bathroom and one of the electrical light fittings right above the shower was loose, which is quite simply just plain dangerous. 

We were greeted coldly by one particular member of the bar staff who made my wife feel quite unwelcome. Still, we stayed and spent over €150 on food and champagne. Settling up the bill with the same member of staff proved slightly troublesome. 

Overall, The Fitzwilliam is a nice hotel but not worth the price tag and it is unlikely we'll return. ",3,2014,01,01
204,Awesome hotel in an awesome location,"The hotel facilities were great. But, the biggest benefits are the staff and the location.  i made my resveravtions for my 2 rooms, Elisa was responsive to my questions and very professional. Jarrko at the concierge desk was amazing. Via email, he recommended several restaurants and made reseravtions at the ones i chose. His choices were spot on and everything was set before i arrived. Now, the location, spent 5 nights at the fitzwilliam and walked everywhere i wanted to go. When i needed public transport, it was close by. Perfect location for shopping, sites abd restaurants...and oh yeh...pubd.",5,2013,12,31
204,Couldn't fault it,"I stayed at this hotel on a two night business trip in December 2013. I honestly could not fault the service and hotel - from the efficient check in, the concierge, the room and restaurant experience I really can't think of any possible improvement. Yes it is expensive but the location could not be better in the centre of Dublin. I would certainly return.",5,2013,12,31
204,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"I spent a week at the hotel on a business trip and really enjoyed it.  The staff were great, food was great, and the room was nice and clean.  Overall it was very pleasant.  The room was spacious and the chocolates left on the bed every night was a nice touch.  The breakfast was fantastic.

Lastly, the hotel is very close to Grafton Street and all the restaurants you could imagine.",5,2013,12,30
204,Great hotel in brilliant location,"We stayed in this hotel recently. Brilliant location at the very top of Grafton Street with parking which is great in the city centre. Staff were excellent and very friendly. Great room and bathroom with a modern feel design wise. The hotel bar does lack a little atmosphere but the lobby of the hotel is so welcoming that it was nice to sit and have a drink there. Cant beat the location of this hotel for a break in Dublin, great for dining, entertainment, shopping etc. Will defiantly be back again.",4,2013,12,30
204,What a special place to stay,"We stayed her for one night, a special night away before Christmas. This hotel was amazing, from the minute we arrived until the moment we left we were very well treated, we felt like nothing was too much. All the staff were attentive, friendly and seemed to be happy in their work. The room was well equipped, we had a view of St Stephens Green and a small balcony, the room was a good size for a city centre room. The bar was good and the lobby area had a lovely welcoming fire. Breakfast was excellent, all wrapped up with 24 hours parking for €10, we will definitely be back.",5,2013,12,27
204,"Brilliant hotel, maybe a little expensive but it's 5* central Dublin....","Stayed here with my wife for her 30th birthday last January ( I know it was a while ago!).

It was supposed to be one of those memorable trips, a lovely relaxing weekend in a lovely city. It was memorable alright....

Very long story short; Set off nice and early and by Monsterboice the car had almost expired, some running repairs go us a few miles, ( thanks to the Monsterboice hotel who provided lots of jugs of water for the car and zero thanks to the extremely grumpy car garage down the road from the hotel who barely could hold a conversation. The world owed that guy a favour! By Balbriggan it was dead completely. So like any normal person would do, (it's now about 6pm) we ditched the car and got a train to Dublin!! 

Into the hotel looking like a pair of drowned rats, with my hands covered in oil, we had a good laugh at the Reception desk with very friendly staff who were probably glad it hasn't happened to them! It did manage to get us a room upgrade though! 
The room was lovely, not huge but sufficient, there was a nice big 4 poster bed, super cool bathroom with built in speakers etc and a good size tv at the end of the bed. Bath had a massive rain shower over it, good pressure and loads if hot water. There were 2 big windows looking out over the Green and what looked like a balcony but it was too wet to try and venture out! 

Down for dinner and it appeared the restaurant manager felt sorry for us too! We had originally booked a dinner, bed and breakfast package, but we had missed the set menu..... Not to be deterred, the manager basically told us to order 3 courses off the a la carte menu and after the day you have had it would be the least they could do!! 
So feeling a little embarrassed that the world knew our story, we had a really really fabulous meal, topped off by the kind of strange but very very tasty Strawberry & basil soup. You have to try it! 

There is a good cocktail menu in the bar downstairs, it wasn't very busy when we were there and there was no entertainment either but that was not a real issue for us.

It's in a pretty good location for shopping & sightseeing etc and really handy if you have a car as it has its own car park. I did not get to try this as mine was in Balbriggian waiting to get towed home, grrrrr......!

Give it a go. Dublin's great, so is the Fitzwilliam, there are cheaper hotels out there, but you do however get what you pay for! 

",5,2013,12,27
204,Superb!,"Booked to stay Christmas period! Great location right at the city center, very clean with excellent quality of service. What really makes this hotel different and special apart from the 5 star rating is the great attention on details and at the same time the unique decoration of the rooms. Very clean and fully equipped. I recommend this hotel with no hesitation.",5,2013,12,27
204,Excellent Service,"Excellent hotel with amazing service.
The rooms are good and quite large. We were there for a conference and the service was perfect with all involved. 
Breakfast and lunch we very good. 
The location is very good right across from the park and beside Grafton St. with all the shopping.",4,2013,12,26
204,Superb stay,"Booked a stay here for a special occasion and was not disappointed.  Warm welcome and great service, right down to the little things such as chocolates with the optional turn down, door men opening the doors, porters calling the lifts, and more.  Car parking was conveniently located in the basement.  The central location gives you lots of options for going out.",5,2013,12,24
204,5 Star in Dublin's BEST location!,"Can't imagine a hotel in Dublin with a better location?  The FitzWilliam is really in the best spot and  the rooms, service and personnel are really nice. My only concern was the access on St Stephens Green, as there are major road works currently in progress, installing a tram or something, and finding the hotel with all the temporary one way roads was a bit confusing.  But if coming in by taxi absolutely no problem!

On the bright side, I thought the front desk staff were extremely helpful and the pub was fun.  Did not eat in the famous Michelin star restaurant but will save that for next time!",4,2013,12,19
204,Not as good as the Westin,"We stayed here for 2 nights this December having stayed in the Westin in Dublin last Christmas. Although the service is probably 5 star, the rest of the hotel definitely isn't - the rooms are just ok (not much better than a Jury's and incredibly warm) and the bar is awful! It's like a 3 star cafe! Back to the Westin next time...",3,2013,12,17
204,Faultless,"I am truly astonished that anybody could review this hotel badly.

My boyfriend and I have just returned from our first weekend in Dublin, and I can honestly say we were extremely impressed with the Fitzwilliam Hotel.

From the moment we arrived, the door was opened for us, we were greeted with warming smiles and treated like royalty. The lobby area was very inviting with a lovely fire and Christmas tree. The receptionist was very welcoming on our arrival and assisted us to our room on the third floor and made us feel instantly at home. We were also given two vouchers for a complimentary glass of mulled wine in the hotel bar - a very nice touch.

The decor was beautiful, unique and modern. Also, the room was very clean.

I loved how flexible this hotel is with breakfast - they allow you to have a long lie, with Saturday's breakfast finishing at 11am and Sunday's at 12. The choice at breakfast was great - continental and Irish (sausages, bacon, eggs etc). I had poached eggs made for me both mornings, and my boyfriend had porridge. Despite rocking up both mornings 5 minutes before breakfast was due to finish, we never felt rushed and the selection was still available (unlike some hotels where you only get food if you get there early!).

Other nice touches were the turn down service in the evening with chocolates, and the fact the hotel gives you shampoo and conditioner rather than just shampoo (definitely helpful as a girl!). Bottled water (still and sparkling) complimentary in the mini fridge. No hesitation in looking after our bags the whole day Sunday as we were flying very late in the evening. The central location is perfect as well - everything is walking distance.

For the price we paid, I was very happy with the Fitzwilliam. It really was smiles from start to finish. RECOMMENDED!!",5,2013,12,16
204,Do not stay! Not 5 star rooms!,"A truly awful hotel unless you have no need for sleep. We live in a London so used to noise but this is a constant loud plumbing/air conditioning noise, like a fan in a bathroom that when it stops it's a great feeling but this does not stop! I am certain this is not isolated to room 414. Made a complaint but they could do nothing, concierge tried to assist but what could he do in reality? He looked surprised but it seemed an act of a man who was well used to this issue.  No room change offered as apparently full - offered a night cap to help us relax not so useful for a pregnant partner. Hotel states 'our world revolves around you' this applies as long as you do not have an issue.  To be honest from the very start I was not impressed as the hotel has an obsession on getting all your credit card details so you do not take anything even though the mini bar automatically charges you for anything you may touch.  An Iceland supermarket of the 5 star world of hotels. Trip advisors please take this seriously as I am normally a positive reviewer, so if I say it is bad it is! I have asked for a complaints log when I leave so the hotel cannot deny these have been made as they have apparently so in the past!",1,2013,12,14
204,Great place to stay ,Never stayed here before but will be back quite possibly the nicest hotel in Dublin I have stayed in had Dinner in citron restaurant which was a great place to dine the food was great and atmosphere was fantastic well worth another visit I will be back ,5,2013,12,13
204,A Gem in the heart of the City,"Stayed recently with my husband & son for an overnight city break ,very family friendly , superb location,the concierge were excellent and overall the staff & facilities were top class. Will definitely stay again .",5,2013,12,12
204,Fully capititalizing on it's prime urban location.,"For those who spend minimal time in their rooms, & who can sleep through anything; this might be an acceptable lodging choice.
What a dreadfuly horrid place to get some peace & quiet, though. 
Every door slamming reverberates around the floor.
Each coat hangar clanging next door- is audible.
Almost every sound transmits from adjoining rooms. 
My room size is relatively tiny- but not as small as a hotel room can get.
There are ample electrical outlets, & the lights all work.
A couple good highlights worth noting; are the monogrammed towels & the distinct stationary set.",2,2013,12,11
204,Nice comfy hotel,"Hotel was very nice and comfortable. The rooms were nicely decorated and had all of the essentials. The aircon was easy to use and was effective. 
We are in the citron restaurant at dinner. It was a set menu with 3 starters, mains and pudding to chose from. The food was nice and waitress was attentive. 
The concierge were very friendly and helpful. Probably the nicest concierge  I've ever seen. 
The hotel was in a fantastic location- right off grafting street so perfect for shops, restaurants, bars or even just a stroll. 
Would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure

204,Weekend Break,"Stayed in Fitzwilliam 7th and 8th december 2013, Checked in room wasnt ready, so had a drink in the hotel bar, staff a bit unfriendly. When we got to our executive room it was a bit on the small side so upgraded to superior room, which wasnt a lot bigger for extra 60 euros, wonderful bath and shower in room and ordered room service in the morning, tea and toast, which after 45mins hadnt arrived , so rang reception and was served in 10 mins, for 18 euros, 1 pot of tea and 3 slices of toast, very overpriced and over rated hotel, rooms very well sound proofed, great location but overall for a 5 star hotel i would have expected a lot more for my 400 euro bill...",3,2013,12,10
204,"Accommodating, great location","When reserving our Dublin hotel this year, we had a couple of choices.  We stayed at Fitzwilliam last year, and their accommodation toward weary travelers is what made up my mind to go back there, along with the great location.

On both occasions, we arrived early in the morning after flying all night, and we were exhausted.  The hotel staff got us a room right away so we could rest.  They could have made us wait, legitimately, but they went out of their way to find us a room ready so we could catch up on some much needed sleep.  The concierges and bell men are very helpful as well.

The rooms are really nice, comfortable & attractive, great bathrooms.  And the location couldn't be better, right on St. Stephen's Green, in the midst of all sorts of shopping and good restaurants.",4,2013,12,09
204,Great Experience,Travelled to Dublin for a work training course and was really pleased with the accomadation. The facilities are up there with the best and the staff were always willing to please. The early morning runs around the streets of Dublin were really great and the gentleman just up the corner between the Fitzwilliam and the mall is a wealth of knowledge of the locals abd area in general.,5,2013,12,09
204,great stay,"great staff. comfy beds. In the heart of everything.
Very friendly and accomodating staff. we slept 12 hours after long flight. Stumblimg distance to many pubs, shopping, and everything else. Food and drink at hotel was quite tasty as well.",5,2013,12,08
204,Fantastic location,"Have stayed a few times here. Staff are always friendly and helpful. The location is fantastic. Breakfast was good too. The small bedroom was  a little overheated for our taste but very nicely appointed. The wee gym is handy too. Yes, we would and have returned.",4,2013,12,05
204,"great staff, great location, great hotel","From the moment I arrived late on a Friday night to the time I left on Monday morning we couldn't have been better looked after. The front desk staff at reception were friendly, professional and helpful. Indeed, so were the concierge staff and the chambermaids. All of them greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome.

 The room was extremely comfortable and the bed was superbly comfortable.

 Its location on St Stephen's Green was perfect for evrything from Lansdowne Road to Temple Bar and Trinity.

 I would definitely stay in the Fitzwilliam again.",4,2013,11,29
204,stay for Dublin marathon,"We stayed four nights over the marathon weekend on room basis.  The hotel room was spacious but on the first night we could hear the ventilation unit above our bedroom and it kept me awake. So at midnight they moved us to another room and relocated us to permanent room on the following morning. That was quiet and great.  
The room was spacious and all you would wish for.  The service was excellent; especially conceige  service was excellent.
we did eat at the bar area one night and food was very good.",5,2013,11,24
204,"Location Great, Staff Great, Atmosphere OK","I liked this hotel overall, I would rate it highly if it was a 4* hotel, but it was lacking a little as a 5* hotel.

Here are the good bits:
Fantastic location
Lovely room
Great staff - naturally nice, friendly and helpful
Great breakfast

Some bits that need improvement:
Difficult to improve due to the footprint, but the lobby was small and lacked a welcoming atmosphere - the reception is tucked away at the back.
Our room was the last in a looooooooong corridor, bit of a trek.  An alternative was offered, fair play to the staff, but this was smaller and stuffy, so we declined.
One of the lifts was not working, leading to some congestion, I'm sure this was a temporary issue though.
The bar seemed (with just a brief nosey in the door) to be more of a restaurant, not somewhere you'd wander in for a pint and the read of a paper.

Would I go back?  Probably not, it was a nice hotel alright, but next time I would probably go for a high-end 4* hotel - something with a bit of luxury alright, but more atmosphere.",3,2013,11,22
204,Wonderful stay in Dublin!,I can't praise this hotel enough.  The staff are so friendly and extremely obliging.  The rooms are a good size and very clean.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in - I've spent many nights in different hotels over the years.  We arrived as a party of 13 females and enjoyed a fantastic weekend at this hotel.  Shops and nightlife are all within easy walking distance.,5,2013,11,21
204,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Just spent a weekend at the Fitzwilliam and once again had a fantastic stay. Beautiful room overlooking Stephens Green, wonderful staff, terrific breakfasts and a great friendly relaxed vibe that you just dont get in other 5 stars, and as for the location, its the very best !",5,2013,11,19
204,Alright only!,"Stayed there Saturday nite with my fiends for her 30th Birthday treat!

I expect something more special from 5*! Beds were prepared for 3 people in room alright, but everything else was like for 2 people: 2 robs, 2 slippers, and only two welcome sweets.. its those small things what matters.. and just didn't felt right when everything is set for 2 people!
And especially for the price what we paid, which we didn't mind, because expected 5* level..

And at breakfast I was never offered toast nor coffee! I was seated and I nobody approach me. I went and ask for coffee myself. 

Service wasn`t great at all. I wouldn't stay there unless they drop the star and price! Because our experience was only average..",3,2013,11,17
204,Perfect,"Staff are just wonderful, breakfast gorgeous, location perfect and rooms modem clean and some have great views of the city. 

The rooms are more modern over luxurious (if you like old world luxury go to the shelbourne) and there are no facilities really as in the hotel could do with a bigger gym area/hot tub/steam room so the business's traveller or those on longer stays can enjoy their stay but for a long weekend trip this hotel is perfect.

We stayed here for our wedding and the staff were just so thoughtful and helpful. It couldn't have gone any better! ",5,2013,11,17
204,If only we could have stayed longer?,"With hotels, the adage is usually quite true: you get what you pay for. With the Fitzwilliam Hotel, we got every penny's worth! Our room was comfortable, luxurious, and impeccably clean. Hotel staff were courteous and helpful, and dinner at Thorton's was the best meal I've ever eaten. Truly the stay of a lifetime--if only we could have stayed longer! ",5,2013,11,16
204,Perfect location for shopping and enjoying city nightlife,"We stayed here recently on a Saturday night. We got a lovely friendly welcome, beautiful 4 poster bed in our room which had a lovely view of St Stephens Green. The room was so quiet considering the city centre location. Its location for shopping is second to none, we could easily return to the hotel and drop off our shopping. The staff were exceptionally good from the front desk to the barman. Special thanks to Egle and her front desk team for their care and attention. The location of the hotel mean we could easily walk to some amazing restaurants and enjoy the city without the hassle of taxis. We will definitely be back.",5,2013,11,14
204,Near Perfection,"By far the most pleasant surprise in my many trips to Dublin. After traveling nearly 18 hours and arriving at DUB at dawn, I was rather exhausted and in need of a shower. The friendly and welcoming staff had a room ready for me, having anticipated my arrival time. I was taken to my room by a front desk staffer who was lovely and gave me the run-down of all the bells and whistles, including a fantastic stereo system with speakers throughout the room, bathroom and foyer. It was nice to have a foyer to simply keep my suitcase on a stand, as I was only staying in Dublin for a couple of nights. That said, there was plenty of storage space and a safe. The ""garden view"" was really unimpressive, but it's Dublin! You're not going to be in your room much. 

There was a lovely seating area next to the window, complete with an orchid. The room felt very modern, yet warm. The bed was absolutely delightful, as were the pillows that you can select from a pillow menu! The bathroom is quite modern for an Irish hotel, but short folks should be forewarned – The shower/bathtub is quite deep, and I can only imagine how difficult it would be for someone shorter then say 5'8 to climb in and out. I'm 5'11 and was cautious. This is typical of any European hotel, though. I really enjoyed the little things like arriving back at the end of a long day to find chocolates on my bed with turndown service, and candles in both the guestroom and bathroom.

Located directly across from St. Stephen's Green and a mere block off Grafton St., the location simply couldn't be better. There's also a Luas stop practically at the doorstep. Additionally, Thornton's restaurant located above the hotel is one of the finest restaurants in all of Dublin. I highly recommend the chef's tasting menu and wine pairing. I did pop into the hotel's lounge/restaurant, and was rather unimpressed. I just didn't like the vibe. This isn't a big deal, as there is always Thornton's upstairs or a plethora of other fantastic pubs and restaurants right at your doorstep.",4,2013,11,13
204,FINALLY,"There are not many high standard hotels that I have not staying in in Dublin, but finally I got to stay here.............it's one of the best at what they do, from the second you get the car parked for you to the minute you check out that whole experience is fantastic, the rooms are fresh modern and clean with all the amenities one could need for a comfort stay, the bar is of the same standard, breakfast is one not to be missed as they carry everything you might need to satisfy every palate.
I am already looking forward to my next stay",5,2013,11,11
204,Amazing hotel with all amenities,"Enjoyed my nights at fitzwilliam.  Staff and hotel are lovely and comfortable.  Rooms are impeccable however a bit small with long long hallways to get there. However bathroom is delightful, clean and full of great amenities hard to find in Irish hotels.  Candles in bathroom and bedroom are a lovely touch. Curtains are barely big enough for privacy and early morning light... However all else at Fitzwilliam hotel  is divine. Comfortable bed, lovely linen and great lighting choices.",5,2013,11,09
204,"This Hotel would Fitz anyone, not just William.","A lovely clean, central, friendly, outstanding hotel.  Beautifully decorated room, upgraded upon arrival and parking included.  The concierge ""Jacob"" from Finland is very helpful and nothing is a problem.  All requests from room service were very prompt and never a problem.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,11,06
204,"Ideal Location, Nice, Modern Hotel","We were bumped from the Shelbourne at the last minute and placed in the Fitzwilliam, just a few blocks away. While it wasn't our first choice, it turned out to be completely fine. It's in an unbeatable location, across from St. Stephens Green and in walking distance to most attractions, like Trinity College. The rooms are comfortable. Service was perfect. Breakfast was tasty, too. It's a modern/chic hotel. While our preference was for a historic/venerable hotel like the Shelbourne, Firzwilliam turned out to quite nice.",4,2013,11,06
204,Nice location and comfortable,"No complaints at all about our stay - it was very close to things we wanted to see downtown, and the room was clean and nicely attended to.  Next door was a nice club for drinks, and Grafton Street shopping was only a few steps away.  I would recommend this hotel when staying downtown.",5,2013,11,06
204,Super city location if you can get out of their divine beds!!,"Cool, sophisticated hotel in super central city centre location.  I booked the hotel for it's central location right at the top of Grafton Street overlooking Stephen's Green.  Hotel Staff were friendly and helpful.  Room was gorgeous - fab decor well laid out with ample space.  But the bed was simply divine - so comfortable with the most exquisite pillows and bedding. Definitley the best bed I've ever slept in.",5,2013,11,06
204,"Great hotel, excellent location","Great hotel. Nice rooms, good service. FIne breakfast. Very nice location in the middle o the centre. Overall: excellent hotel which i would recommend to friends, family and collegues. Personal service at the frontdoor and quick service at check in and check out. The hotel is located very close to a tram station.",5,2013,11,05
204,Wonderful service and beautiful rooms.,"My stay at the Fitzwilliam Dublin was extremely enjoyable! The location --  across the street from a lovely park and an easy walk to many restaurants and shops. My room was spacious and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was large and well stocked. The staff was attentive, helpful and friendly. While I was there, the restaurant, 'Citron' had a special  ""taste of Dublin"" menu. The food was excellent and the staff amazingly attentive.",5,2013,11,05
204,Fantastic design hotel with great service,"Booked upon recommendation from colleagues.What a great place!
Location couldn't be better for seeing the city,shopping and dinner/drinks (St Stephens green area had everything we were looking for-medium/high end food/entertainment,target 25-40).
The hotel itself was great-friendly and professional service,great room(comfortable bed,silent,great design,delicious welcome chocolates,hotel guide to the city),high end services(nail salon,gym,several restaurants,good/varied breakfast).
Would highly recommend for both business or pleasure trips!
Tips in vicinity: Peploe's restaurant,37 Dawson cocktail bar,O'donahues pub.",5,2013,11,03
204,"Nice Hotel, Good Location","Not too much to say here. Overall a good hotel. Nice modern rooms, comfortable bed, above average breakfast (extra). 

Wifi is slow but free. Staff are friendly and the location is perfect. 

My water pressure for the sink was terrible and the drain stopped working. The doors are thin in terms of noise so I woke up to door slams in the morning all the time. 

But overall good. ",4,2013,11,03
204,"Stylish luxury, large rooms","Our stay at the Fitzwilliam Dublin was nothing short of spectacular! 

The location -- right across the street from St. Stephen's Green -- is perfect. It's a very short walk to the high street (Grafton) and well positioned for walking anywhere. 

The standard rooms are spacious and stylish. Our entryway had hardwood floors, a large bathroom and plenty of room to stretch out.

The staff is attentive, helpful and friendly. Our requests for local restaurants led us to great places with a wonderful vibe. 

The hotel's bar is open 24 hours (bonus!). While we were there, the restaurant Citron featured a special prix fixe ""taste of Dublin"" menu. The food was simply wonderful! 

Our room's amenities included:
- Hard-wired speakers for music throughout the room
- Typical iron and board, hair dryer, safe, TV and minibar
- Trousers press for that perfect crease
- Robes, slippers, umbrella",5,2013,11,02
204,"Nothing to complain about, but no wow-factor either","Stayed here for a weekend in October.  Hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating, hotel is really well located (as are many hotels in a city that is so easily walkable).  We probably didn't spend more than 8 or 9 hours in total in the hotel - we were out all day and night on the Saturday so literally slept there and then checked out the next morning, so really not much to say.  I was expecting a bit more in terms of the decor because of the reviews I had read, but it was fine overall.",3,2013,10,31
204,Must do it again.,Across from a beautiful park which has swans and ducks. Convenient to shopping large mall and all tour sites.  Staff was able to help with Irish shows in all of Dublin.  Reservations for the citrateon restaurant is very limited so suggest you make your reservations as soon as you get there once you are there you will love the staff and food.,5,2013,10,30
204,In the city's heart with heart,"Wow! A lovely hotel with super friendly and helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble, from charging my iPhone, getting drinks brought up, getting movies for 2 young children to printing off a map of Dublin City Marathon. Concierges Marcin and Daniel were super attentive with pleasant relaxed demeanours. Brid in reception was very pleasant and had a huge smile that covered the reception desk. I loved the experience. The duty manager even opened the service lift so we wouldn't have to wait long on the guest lift. The breakfast was outstanding and there were cookies and a personal note on arrival. My only regret was that we couldn't stay longer. I hope next time I ring, Martina in reservations ( also extremely helpful) it is to book a longer stay!",5,2013,10,28
204,"Eccentric and amazing, this place stands out!","The Fitzwilliam is located very centrally with a short walk to the main centre of Dublin. It also sits in front of the beautiful St Stephens Green, which I advise you walk around as it is a lovely walk.
Myself and my boyfriend actually walked everywhere and couldn't have been happier with the choice of hotel. 
The breakfast buffet was by far the nicest breakfast buffet I have ever experienced with mini pastries to delicious banana and strawberry yogurt/smooties. On weekends they have a Full English out including black and white pudding.... yum! There was soo much option when it came to dried fruits etc.... The staff were very sweet and always offered us a coffee or a tea every morning on weekdays we also got asked if we would like any eggs as only pastries and fruit were available.
The decor was fantastic, but this is all taste, as you can see from the website and pictures it really stands out. It has its own identity entirely.
The staff were always on hand to help, offering to take bags up and they have a great knowledge of the area so make sure you speak to them!
If you want to go somewhere a bit special I suggest you choose here, you will not be disappointed.",5,2013,10,27
204,Luxurious stay ,"As we searched for hotels in Dublin the Fitzwilliam was our third choice since the others were booked.  I am glad they were! My husband stated this was his favorite place out of 6 places we stayed on our trip. The location is perfect.  Just across from St Stephens green and just down from Grafton St.  The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept on. The biggest plus for me lots of pillows! Breakfast was fabulous and the waitstaff were excellent.  The maids deserve a big shout out because the room was immaculate. Last but not least the front desk,  concierge,  doormen and other hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating.  I can't think of a single criticism for our 2 night stay.  This was the first stop on our 2 week honeymoon and they gave us a warm Irish welcome!!",5,2013,10,24
204,Excellent location and a couple of small negatives,"I spent one night on a business trip at the Fitzwilliam. The positives: excellent location overlooking St Stephen's green; good breakfast; good service. However, my overall rating is only average, given the twin single beds, the weird sound when walking on the carpet, as if there were plastic bags under it (yes I am very serious about it, what is wrong with your room carpet Fitzwilliam? tell us more about the plastic layer under it) and finally, a real shock when I am told the hotel would take a £15 deposit for lending me a plug adaptor. Of course I returned it and was not charged the £15, but wow what a mentality!",3,2013,10,23
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin,"This is a wonderful, top rate hotel, located overlooking St Stephen's Green. The bedrooms are large and the service is exemplary. Several restaurants to choose from with professional, yet very friendly staff. There is a fun bar on the ground floor where we had drinks and a bite to eat late in the afternoon. Just steps from Grafton Street, this is the best hotel in Dublin. The people at the concierge desk, and those who work at reception are cheerful and most helpful. This is where we will stay on our next visit.",5,2013,10,22
204,Excellent staff and locatiom,"Top notch place. Classic Irish with an au current twist. Staff are engaged, concerned and take action. Bit of a delay getting to room but i did request a particular room. However i was kept up to date. Showers are great and 'proper' tea in their rooms.",5,2013,10,20
204,Very Pleasant Surprise!,"My husband and I have traveled all over the world and we tend to stay at top-notch hotels.  We were disappointed when, while planning a last-minute trip to Dublin, all of the major ""5-star,"" hotels in the city were completely booked.  We found the Fitzwilliam through Trip Advisor and in all honesty, we didn't have very high expectations.  Boy, were we wrong!  This is a 5-star hotel by any standard.  Granted, we're not fans of modern decor (we prefer, when visiting old cities, to stay in grand, old hotels), but aside from the decor not being to our taste, the Fitzwilliam hit all the 5-star marks.  The beds are extremely comfortable, complete with luxury linens and great (and plentiful), pillows.  The rooms are well thought out and every luxury is provided and to say that the place is clean is a vast understatement.  There is turn-down service at night.  The morning breakfast is terrific.  I highly, highly recommend this hotel and upon returning to Dublin, would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The hotel staff go out of their way to be helpful and accommodating.  This is a terrific hotel.",5,2013,10,17
204,dublin delight,After a long day of delays and finally arriving at the Fitzwilliam we were greeted by the most wonderful staff.  Anything we needed they were right there to help with! After long days of sight seeing returning to our rooms to find our beds turned down each night with a chocolate on the pillows was lovely!  We were told by fellow travelers to try a pub they had enjoyed but when we inquired about it we were told it was really a younger crowd and for a true Irish experience we might want to try one on the local pubs.  It turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Gogherty's Pub was truly as authentic as they come! Thanks Fitzwilliam for not steering us wrong!,5,2013,10,15
204,Great location,"I stayed here for three nights recently as I was getting married in a church nearby. I had booked 9 rooms altogether for our group and Lorna, the Events Manager, was extremely helpful dealing with the booking. The rooms were all very nice although the standard rooms are somewhat small. All of the staff were very nice during our stay although I found the service at breakfast somewhat disorganised. I was told by one staff member on one morning that as we were on a B&B rate all items on the menu were included. The following day I was told I had to pay a supplement for certain items. I think if you have been quoted a B&B rate then you should be able to have any item on the menu. Other than that the breakfast was very good. We also had the bar food for lunch one day which was lovely. The location of this hotel is perfect for anyone visiting Dublin and I would recommend it. ",4,2013,10,15
204,Style in the heart of Dublin!,"I spent a week in this great hotel in June after it was recommended by a friend with similar taste to my own. The location couldn't have been better as it's a 2 minute walk from Grafton St with it's charming shops, cafe's, pubs and world renowned buskers. It also stands opposite St Stephen's Green, is a short walk to Trinity College and the night life of the Temple Bar area. It may surprise some with it's minimalistic decor in the lobby, but the rooms are quite lovely and a good size by Irish standards. My king size bed had fine linens and good quality pillows and a charming sofa/window seat beneath large windows. There were all the usual amenities that come with a 5 star hotel. The bathroom products were especially good. The bathroom was quite large with a huge tub and shower above. I didn't have breakfast in the hotel but we went to the bar quite a few times where one could have a snack, light meal or something more. The staff couldn't be faulted and the concierge was especially helpful in regard to making helpful recommendations and booking trips, train tickets etc. There is a tiny gym with a few machines. I only went in a couple of times and was the only person there. The same occurred at the ""business centre"" which was very small and always empty. I will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2013,10,14
204,nice,This is a nice place. The room was great. I am not a big fan of big-city hotels because you end up paying for parking and having to tip for every little thing. That being said this place is nice. It is very close to everything. We were able to walk about the center of town very easily from the hotel.,4,2013,10,14
204,Nice hotel but wouldn't say 5*,Nice enough hotel. Room was quiet but quite small. Expected a bigger room for 5*. Nothing special compared to other 5*. Would say a good 4 star. Location great though. Didn't eat there so don't know about food. Would stay again but wouldn't necessarily be excited about getting back to it.,3,2013,10,12
204,Great location and great service,"The Fitzwilliams was a wonderful place to stay in Dublin.  As others have stated, it is in a wonderful location - across the street from a lovely park and walking distance to almost everything in Dublin.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Our room was spacious and nicely outfitted.  The bathroom had one of the best bathtubs I've ever encountered - deep, long, and big enough for two people.  If you have time, get a message from Ursula - she was really really good.",5,2013,10,12
204,The Fitzwilliam is wonderful,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is perhaps Dublin's most conveniently located hotel if you've come to see Dublin. It's walking distance from many of the city's most popular attractions and also just across the corner from where the buses park for Dublin's 'jump-on, jump-off' bus tours. 
The rooms are beautiful and we found the staff friendly, helpful and gracious. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel but the breakfast offered was wonderful.
It has a very chic decor, very moderne but hardwoods throughout and a few lovely old portraits give the sense of Dublin's historic past. The Fitzwilliam is a wonderful combination of a lovely New World hotel with gracious Old World manners and service.",5,2013,10,10
204,Basic problems: Dining Quality/Space & Noise,"I've had a great trip through Ireland, staying and many diverse castles and B&Bs, but as I'm writing this review I'm in our room at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin, I'm regretting that we're booked here for another two nights.

Dinner the first night was OK, but I won't rave about the food when I can prepare a better salmon dish than they do (I don't cook much). It didn't taste fresh, either. Breakfast the next morning was a flop. I waited for the eggs at the buffet to get restocked so I could enjoy a hot breakfast. I waited some more but they never came, so I grabbed some cold food and sat down, only to be told by the hostess that I needed to move to another table (despite the empty table and open seating). Because the dining area is way too small for the size of the hotel, there wasn't another table, so I left my plate of cold scraps and went to the coffee shop next door. 

I see in another review that someone praised the hotel for being quiet. This is actually my bigger complaint: The plumbing (or something) makes all sorts of noises, which is why I'm up writing this review two hours before I planned to wake up, with a steady sound of a pipe rattling in the wall like someone softly tapping a hammer. I would expect a hotel of this stature to work things like that out. If they move us to another room, then I'll know there is some other poor sap listening to the noise.",1,2013,10,05
204,Luxury Hotel,"A FANTASTIC Hotel situated in the heart of Dublin! Close to all Pubs and Shopping! The back rooms are beautifully peaceful and the rooms quite charming with modern accents...The four poster bed was so comfortable! We had service at the snap of a finger! 

The concierge staff was knowledgable and booked us tours and rest reservations upon request! They promoted the Wild Wicklow Tour and we LOVED it! 

The Hotel restaurant was beautifully done and the food delicious! Ivan the Bartender kept us entertained on the last night with Irish Wiskey Tastings!..the Lobby is quite inviting and green apples on each floor welcomed us and kept us healthy..""AN APPLE A DAY""...haha",5,2013,10,04
204,Almost perfect,"My BFF and I just returned from a week in Dublin, all spent at the Fitzwilliam. Pros: it is a gorgeous property (just my style and color palette!) and is in an amazingly central location. Our room was surprisingly quiet and had wonderful amenities, including the fabulous tub! On the downside, we found the staff to be inconsistent. Some were incredibly helpful and kind, while others were indifferent, perhaps even rude (e.g., the doorman who was busy texting on his mobile phone as I struggled to enter the rather substantial doors while saddled down with bags and an open umbrella). Also not appreciated was the eternal uttering of ""just another 10-15 more minutes"" when we tried to check in early after our long overnight flights. Although we fully understand the definition of check-in time, it was frustrating to be told this repeatedly over the course of several hours while we watched others being checked in early. Either stick to your policy or not, but please don't try to buy time while saying ""just a few more minutes!"". Having said the above, I would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay here again should my travels bring me back to Dublin. Cheers!",4,2013,09,29
204,"Wonderful, modern hotel","A marvelous hotel, beautifully located in the heart of Dublin shopping and tavern scene. The rooms were spacious and nicely maintained. The concierge staff was most helpful and their recommendations were spot on. Ask for a room that does not face the street. It can get quite noisy in the park across the street (until the very late hours).",4,2013,09,29
204,great location!,"we had stayed at the belfast fitzwilliam, so stayed here as a result. location is great. it's actually remarkably quiet in the hotel, which is nice considering the activity outside. staff were very nice and accommodating. concierge was very helpful. would definitely stay here again on my next trip to dublin!",5,2013,09,29
204,Waiting an hour for cold soup,"We arrived into the hotel late on Sunday night, in preparation for a business meeting on Monday morning.  The room was very nice and the powerful shower and big bath were very welcome.

I pulled out the trouser press, and out fell the previous resident's pornographic magazine.  That was, er, unexpected.  Perhaps forgiveable - I doubt the cleaner's checklist includes ""check appliances for porn"".

Tired and hungry, we ordered room service.  We called reception, who greeted us by identifying our room number, and put us through to the kitchen.  We gave our order carefully and were told it would be with us in 20 minutes or so.

An hour passed - we called back and were told they hadn't taken our room number, and so our food had just been sitting there!  As a gesture they said there would be no charge for the food - they brought it up immediately, but nobody gave thought that soup sitting for an hour will be stone cold.  We phoned back and got another delivery of soup.

The rest of the food wasn't quite what we ordered, either - we had to pick out the ingredients which we had specifically requested not be included.  Salmon served on Jamaica ginger cake rather than bread was unexpected, too.

If we had popped out for some food instead of room service, I would be giving my stay a much higher review - the room service experience really left a dampener.

Earlier in the day we had got a cup of tea in McDonald's, with a request to only half-fill the cup - the server made the tea and was at pains to check that the water level matched what we wanted.  A far better service experience for a much lower price!",2,2013,09,28
204,wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night in July. It is in a perfect location. The hotel is very modern. Our very quiet room was on the top floor facing the inner courtyard. The room was wonderful, comfortable bed, lovely bathroom and great towels.",5,2013,09,28
204,The start of our week long trip through Ireland,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights at the beginning of our week long trip in Ireland.  We loved this hotel!  Great  service at the front desk and at the restaurant.  The Concierge team were the best we encountered through out the four hotels we stayed in during the week.  We got spot on recommendations from the Concierge folks on restaurants, pubs and places to visit.  This hotel is really centrally located and easy walking distance  to pubs, sight seeing spots, tours to catch and shopping areas and to the Temple Bar area.  Would go back there in a heart beat!",5,2013,09,27
204,Overnight Stay,"Good Hotel would stay again - Mostly there is always something with a hotel I dont like or feel needs improvement however on this occassion I could find no real fault. Staff were pleasant and professional.  Valet parking good, room good with a window seat overlooking the courtyard. good breakfast with tables all cleaned and tidied promptly. The only downside for us was late on the friday evening loud music in the distance although this was probably outside the control of the hotel. We hope to return to the hotel with the family next time. the hotel did provide a lovely touch for our anniversary of chocolates and a message from the manager in our room.",4,2013,09,26
204,Great weekend,"Fantastic hotel and staff. The Concierge team couldn't do enough for you as a customer and recommended a top restaurant. 
Definitely a top choice for the heart of dublin. 
Special thanks to Egle for her warm welcome and friendly smile. ",5,2013,09,23
204,Wanted to Love it,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 2 week journey through Scotland and Ireland.  We booked a 5 star hotel as a treat for the last few days of our trip.  The hotel itself is in a great location, within walking distance to nearly everything you'd want to see and visit.  The staff is friendly, professional and what you'd expect of a 5 star experience.  We were on the street facing side which we loved, great view of St. Stephens Park and beautiful with the lights at night. You can hear and see people & the small rail system below, but with the windows closed the noise isn't bad. 

The rooms are quite small and the beds not so comfortable.  There is almost too much furniture in the rooms for the size of them.  There was a wall air conditioner but it was so loud and clunky, it was a toss up as to whether to be warm or sleep in a quiet room.  The bathroom was great!  Very roomy with lots of shelves and space for your bags and towels, etc. and the shower was equally good, with good pressure, etc.

The quality of the bed linens, the towels and other amenities didn't align with a 5 star hotel and  we felt it was a little underwhelming for the price which was quite high. 

I think with more looking, one might find a better value for basically an equivalent experience &  hotel grade.",3,2013,09,23
204,Excellent location and service,"Our taxi driver from the airport had a difficult time getting to the hotel as they are working on the streets. The hotel is in a perfect location, across from the park; Grafton Street is ½ block away and Dawson St. is a 3 minute walk. When I first entered the hotel it gave me a cold sterile feel with contermporary furnishings and a gray color, but the doormen were warm and welcoming as was the reception check-in. We had room 315, which was located on the inner courtyard and we could look into the rooms on the other side, which didn’t feel very private. This felt like a businessman’s hotel. The room was on the small side, but the bathroom was a nice size and the shower was great! There was enough shelf space (which is rare in Europe) to put your bath kit and anything else! In front of the window in the bedroom area was a built in seating area with no backing and a lot of wasted space. We used it for our “stuff” as it was not comfortable to relax on. The thing about this hotel is the friendly and helpful service. The men at concierge were always ready to assist with a  smile. They loaned us an adaptor and it came immediately. We had a quick bite to eat in the bar area and the Albondogas meatballs were wonderful, served with some sourdough-like bread. The room rate was expensive and for what the room was we didn’t think the value was really great, but the service and location made up for it.",4,2013,09,22
204,Disappointing 5 star experience,Deluxe room overlooking St. Stephens Green. Nasty sewage smell on entering the room. Room had not been prepared as I discovered a gent's toilet bag in the bathroom and an opened bottle of water sitting on the bedside cabinet. This was a Wednesday night and the noise from the nightclub/bar below continued until approx. 2.30am. Not a restful experience.,2,2013,09,21
204,Such a great find,"Location, service, decor, food & drink - this place has everything.  The hotel is right in the middle of everything, but without the noise being heard in the rooms.  The concierge service was top notch - from securing theater tickets to printing out train time tables.  The turn-down service was an especially lovely touch.",5,2013,09,18
204,Hope to get to visit this hotel again SOON!!,Celebrated my 50th birthday and my 4th wedding anniversary in Dublin.  The staff couldn't have been nicer.   Tony the concierge couldn't have been nicer.  He checked with us every time he saw us to make sure things were the best they could be.    He made our trip more special by arranging dinner for us on our anniversary.   LOVED this hotel.  Breakfast in the morning was wonderful and the staff was extremely nice.    The location is perfect.,5,2013,09,18
204,More for business travelers,"My husband and I were here in the spring for our honeymoon. They upgraded our room and it was on the top floor with a balcony overlooking St. Stephen's Green, the view was beautiful.  The room was small. Very tight with bed, dresser, tv, desk etc.. The bathroom was nice and big. Unfortunately the walls are paper thin. The only reason we found this out was that our neighbor was taking a bath every night at 2 am. Staff was okay. They seemed to favor more towards the business folk not a tourist or five-star hotel. I will be returning to the Wetbury next time in Dublin",3,2013,09,16
204,"Perfect location, modern decor, great staff","We had booked a flight/hotel package through Orbitz, which normally never results in any problems arriving at the hotel. Well, when we arrived at the Fitzwilliam after a long/horrible day of traveling we discovered they didn't have our reservation! They had no idea we were coming. I actually broke down in tears at the front desk because we had just had the most frustrating time getting to Dublin from DC (no thanks to American Airlines). But one of the front desk workers was the sweetest girl, and took me into their bar and had the staff make me a cappuccino while she and my boyfriend tried to figure out what had gone wrong. 

After 15 minutes of searching their computer, it turns out the hotel had received our confirmation from Orbitz, but somehow it never got into their reservation system. Yes, this was a mistake on their part, but the front desk was extremely apologetic and upgraded our room. They even gave us vouchers for free cocktails for the bar. Although our stay had a rocky start, I felt like the staff at the Fitzwilliam went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time. 

And the rest of our stay was nearly perfect: the room was spotless, the concierge was helpful, the food and room service was delicious, and the location across from St Stephens Green was a great jumping off point for exploring the rest of the city. We had a room overlooking the courtyard and it was very quiet. The tub was HUGE. I loved the room. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2013,09,13
204,A great hotel in a good location,"I had a great time staying here, the staff were very good - friendly, competent, organised - they couldn't be faulted.   Well done to the Fitzwilliam for employing and training such good staff.  The room was good, 
The hotel was in a great location for Dublin, close to everything you need to be close to :)
The hotel itself was nice, everything was great, there were just a few quirks and things in the room which didn't make it perfect.",4,2013,09,11
204,Queen suite with garden view,we went the extra mile as it was our wedding anniversary thjought this room would be out of this world the room was on the sixth floor the lift only went to the fifth floor so we had to get off at the fifth walk down the corridor up the stairs down another corridor to our room couldnt wait to see the garden view the room was small the garden view was window boxes with boxed hedging stuck onto the back of the other side of the hotel had to keep the blind closed as u could see right in very dissapointing after paying €400 for 2 nights with no breakfast,4,2013,09,11
204,When in Dublin,"Lately, we've been staying at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin (3 years running now). It's lovely, modern and right across the street from St. Stephen's Green, on of Dublin's most beautiful and accessible parks, right in Central Dublin, or ""An Lar' in the Irish. Gotta love this place, modern, comfortable rooms, seems they all have a flat-panel TV across from either a settee, or 2 comfy chairs and spacious bathrooms. The barroom, always my 2nd most important feature is very cozy, despite being big enough to embrace close to 100. Prices are actually rather reasonable and service is excellent (they bring your change on a stainless steel charger). Food at the bar is exactly what you'd want, casual, familiar and delicious. Best thing about 'The Fitz'?... location, at the foot of Grafton St., across from St. Stephens, and walking distance to Trinity College, the bridge over the Liffy to O'Connell St. and little gems like Doheny & Nesbitt. Worst thing?...simple, the décor in the dining room , you gotta get your (included) full Irish breakfast there. Now the 'full Irish breakfast' is a thing of legend, sunny-side up eggs done perfectly, those lovely Irish sausages, and bacon strips ('rashers') plus juices, cereals and about a dozen other things, served all you care to have. I just hated the color scheme, steel and orange plastic chairs, burger king tables and kinda harsh lighting for anyone feeling 'delicate' in the morning. But we love it anyway.",4,2013,09,09
204,Lovely anniversary weekend,"Travelled to Dublin with husband for anniversary. Hotel was in a fantastic location opposite st Stephens gardens and within walking distance to shops, bars and restaurants. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a fab room with a balcony, very big room, lovely décor, really big bathroom, they had also left us some cake with icing writing saying 'happy anniversary' also gave us complimentary cocktails as there was a delay in our bags reaching our room. Staff were lovely and very helpful. No bad things to say - would definitely stay there again",5,2013,09,06
204,This is a nice hotel,"I stayed here for 3 nights in August 2013.  Great location, within walking distance of great night life and shopping.  Nice rooms, awesome bathrooms.  Very nice bar.  No gegatives as far as I am concerned.  I would stay here again in heartbeat.",5,2013,09,04
204,A very welcomed guest!,"I had a delightful stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin. My husband & I where given a fabulous room with an amazing balcony over looking Steven's Green.
I felt like a princess, the front desk staff were extremely helpful & welcoming & couldn't do more for you.
We had a great night out, close to all the great entertainment places, lovely food, wine bars & to top our evening off we finished our night, at the resident's bar.
We really had a pleasant stay, with an amazing breakfast to end our wonderful time at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.
Defiantly we will stay again!",5,2013,09,04
204,Great Location to everything,Recently spent two nights and this beautiful property in downtown Dublin.  Easy access to everything you want to reach in the city.  The rooms were spacious for european city standards and furnishings were contemporary and beautiful.  The bar and restaurant at the hotel were excellent with quality food and drink.  There was a excellent nightclub next door but be forewarned very young crowd.,5,2013,09,04
204,"Excellent location, staff and value.","Stayed three nights at the Fitzwilliam in July and loved it.  Convenient location just off St.Stephen's Green and grafton st.  The rooms were comfortable and very stylishly furnished.  The staff are the true standout!  Check-in was friendly and efficient.  One staff member, Bronagh Kelleher, was particularly great, and sat with us a few moments and welcomed us and provided us with excellent recommendations for restaurants and shopping.  Loved the funky stylish lobby!  Good value for the money.  ",5,2013,09,03
204,fantastic stay at the fitzwilliam hotel dublin,"the location is great being right in the heart of dublin with numerous places to visit within walking distance from the hotel.
room was very comfortable and quiet.the decor and ambience were pleasing and peaceful.
we didn't the food but there were a number of restaurants to eat out in and the location helped again.
we tried the gym located on level two and found it to be good.
we would stay again if there is an opportunity.",5,2013,08,30
204,Great location and comfortable room,We stayed here for three nights. The hotel is located in a very convenient part of Dublin. The staff was very helpful regarding sights and restaurants. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The beds were turned down in the evenings with chocolates left on our pillows - nice touch!,4,2013,08,29
204,One of my top picks,"I have only stayed in a couple of hotels in my life that I remember as really a comfort. This is definitely one of them. I arrived as one always arrives from the US in the early morning. Totally confused and disoriented by the time change. Upon arrival I was greeted by a really nice man at the check-in who was totally professional and friendly at the same time. The room was perfect.
So now I am in the perfect location in Dublin in a perfect room. Then I need to get some help from the Concierge. Mr. Fitzgibbon is my absolute top pick for a concierge. He helped me with a restaurant location and with train tickets to Killarney but never before has a concierge done so with such kindness and thoroughness. He is the best. Thank you all for a really enjoyable comfortable stay in Dublin.",5,2013,08,29
204,Definitely not 5 star,"We were very disappointed with this hotel.  The halls are dark and worn looking.  The room was quite small, made more so by built-ins. The room looked out at ground level on a courtyard next to an office building - not a pleasant view. The dark wood furniture was stained as was the carpet.  The tub shower combination had a great rain shower, but it didn't drain properly.  This hotel looked like it was partly renovated a few years ago, but they left a lot of old looking dark wood and older bathroom fixtures.  I would give this hotel 3.5 stars only.",3,2013,08,27
204,Perfect in every way,"I have nothing but glowing reviews for the Fitzwilliam.  My daughter and I stayed for two nights and loved everything about this hotel, right down to the smallest detail.  One thing that really stood out is the service - every single staff member we spoke with was exceptionally friendly, helpful and genuinely interested in their guests.  The rooms are great - modern and well appointed.  The beds are superb, and the tub was tough to get out of. ( I actually fell asleep in it after sleepless travel!)
The location really is what the reviews say: perfect.  I highly recommend this hotel, even to the most discriminating traveler.  

Side note: we missed our train, so we headed back into Dublin for breakfast at the Westbury Hotel. We were told we couldn't eat in their dining room ""because you are not our guests"".  Incredibly stupid move on their part.  You won't find this kind of attitude at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2013,08,25
204,Perfect,"Perfect location.  We stayed 3 nights and loved the rooms - very nicely updated.  The breakfast selection and quality were great.  The bartenders were very friendly and gave us great tips on restaurants and quick day trips from Dublin (we chose Howth).  The lobby was very modern, and the people couldn't be nicer - a great way to start our trip.",5,2013,08,21
204,Best breakfast ever and softest bed ever,i stayed here with family from new york we stayed here as we were touring around Ireland. the best was the softest and  most luxurious i have ever slept  in in my life and  the room was fabulous and spacious which we loved as  their was 3 of us with a lot of luggage and  the bathroom was just fabulous except for the cold water for the shower but that was  my fault as  the other members of  my family had showered previously and the breakfast was just to die for the best i have ever had at a hotel in Ireland,5,2013,08,20
204,Very Elegant,"This hotel is an old exterior shell completely modernized inside. Elevators, large rooms, king bed. The staff are very courteous and polite. The room was very clean with turn down service early in the evening. It is right in front of a light rail service and very near the centre of shopping as well as historic buildings.
The price is a little dear but it was last minute so to be expected I guess. We stayed 2 nights so the 2nd night was half the cost of the 1st...",5,2013,08,18
204,Could not be better,"This hotel, centrally located so you can walk to many sights, cannot be improved upon.  From the moment we arrived and were able to check in early to the minute we left we were taken care of by reception, bar tenders, housekeepers and concierge.  Have you ever received a note for leaving the housekeeper a gratuity?  You will at the Fitzwilliam.  The rooms are lovely - and air conditioned.  The only negative is that the breakfast is expensive and served in a very noisy mezzanine area but that can be dealt with by eating elsewhere.  We will send all of our friends to this hotel.",5,2013,08,17
204,Worst sleep I've ever had in Dublin and unresponsive management.,"I've stayed at many of Dublin's finest hotels but gave the FitzWilliam a try while treating my parents to a special trip. The hotel charged me extra for a larger room when I requested quiet space for 3. Fine, I accepted up-front and had no issue with cost. But there's a nightclub next door and we couldn't sleep for 3 days straight. I had to call front desk in middle of night more than once. I understand Dublin is a loud city, but this was ridiculous since I'd communicated in advance that my elderly parents needed a quiet room and I paid a premium to upgrade. When I checked out I asked to speak to manager since I wanted the portion of the premium I'd paid to upgrade returned since we were awake nearly 72 hours at that point. They gave me the day-manager's biz card and said to contact him since they are in a constant battle with nightclub. I emailed. Then I called and left voicemails. No response. I am a frequent biz traveler and member of Leading Hotels of the World. This was no 5 star. I will be following up with travel agents and hotel loyalty programs and everywhere if I don't get the premium I paid refunded. Don't get suckered into this hotel. Don't pay an upgrade for a larger QUIET room because you'll end up disappointed. My parent's dream trip turned into a nightmare. Disappointed.",1,2013,08,17
204,Modern & fun in a great location!,"My husband, parents and I stayed here on the last night of our 2 week driving trip around Ireland.  This is a very large hotel right on St-Stephen’s Green.  We loved the beautiful park across the street!  Once you enter the park, you forget that you are right in the middle of busy Dublin.  The grounds of the park are very beautiful and definitely worth a walkthrough.  

Even though this is a big hotel, it offers boutique touches.  The concierge bringing up up to our rooms and showing us where everything is located was very nice. They also provided great dinner recommendations.  The rooms are truly beautiful.  Modern and kinda funky with all the nice colors and touches.  Beds were very comfy and the washroom was great. We both had nice views of a central courtyard.  Location is also very close to Grafton Street and many eateries – very central to whatever you want to do in Dublin.     

This is a great hotel in a perfect location!  Don’t hesitate to stay here!",5,2013,08,16
204,Great Location,My husband and I stayed at this hotel for two nights the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The position of this hotel was perfect opposite Saint Stephens Green and only a few metres to the lovely shops and the best buskers I have ever seen the atmosphere was great. The concierge was very helpful and always greeted us with a smile. We dined in Kevin Thorntons Michelin star restaurant the food was excellent but thought that the service and decor although very good could have been a little better. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.,4,2013,08,15
204,AMAZING,"Nothing can compare. 

Staff went above and beyond to please. Nothing was too much. We arrived before check in time and they fell over themselves to apologise for the room not being ready even though we did not mind. 

The room was stunning. Nothing to fault there. 

The bar is lovely. Staff excellent. 

I read a review staring 'allow 2.5 hrs for dinner' as I have dined in Kevin Thorntons Michelin star restaurant I wouldn't even put it in the same sentence as TGI Fridays but that's just me. 

Overall this was the most luxury I have had in a long time. The concierge could not have been more helpful. He even told us 'we were here to be spoiled' and remembered us by name from the minute he took my keys. I have nothing bad to say. 

Stay here if u like good service, good staff and a touch of class and luxury.",5,2013,08,14
204,Great location and fantastic staff!,"The staff here really make this nice hotel even nicer.  Everyone was quick to handle any issues we had (a mishap with the safe and our door did not lock).  The room was cute, with nice boutique touches.  The bathroom was great with a wonderful shower and the best hair dryer I have ever used at a hotel...ever.  Beds were comfortable and there was no outside noise in our courtyard facing room.  Would recommend again.",5,2013,08,14
204,Will do it again,"My wife & I decided to visit Dublin with our 2 children as they had never experienced what our capital city has to offer. Choosing the Fitzwilliam as our base was definitely a good decision. From the time we arrived (much too early for check -in) until when we left (well after check-out) we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The helpfulness of all staff, check-in, concierge, restaurant, bar & house-keeping was second to none. Pressure was definitely on staff at breakfast on the second morning but it was handled very efficiently. Loved the kippers!! One small gripe, the extractor fan was not operating in the bathroom, causing an excess of condensation. I'm sure this will be rectified.",5,2013,08,14
204,Try It You'll Like It!,"Really nice hotel with a boutique like appeal traditional yet modern touches. Very well situated at the top of Grafton St across from St Stephens Green. Beautifully decorated rooms ours had a very pretty window seat overlooking a lovely interior courtyard. Nice amenities in the bath, comfortable beds. Great breakfast included and helpful concierge. Try it you'll like it!",5,2013,08,12
204,Not a true five star,"rooms were clean, breakfast buffet was great , but this is not a five star hotel, the staff  is    hurried  as there are not enough of them. Rooms are large enough bathrooms are also large enough allow 2.5 hours for dinner or go to tgi Friday's next door",4,2013,08,12
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel.... pleasantly surprising,"We stayed a weekend in Dublin to celebrate with family members who live there. It was difficult to get a room in Dublin as there was the Horse Show and Celtic-Liverpool game on at the same time as what seemed like the rest of the world hahaha! There was something magical about the town and the Fitzwilliam was central to our enjoying the stay. It is located on Stephen's Green and there were more than enough things to do within walking distance for the short time we were there. Don't be thrown off by the exterior to the hotel, inside was modern and comfortable. Our rooms were clean and well tended. The hotel also has what is arguably the ""Best Restaurant in Ireland""....Thornton's Restaurant (see my review). 

The breakfast offering is the only thing I can really complain about as the lack of fresh fruit choice is noticeable. The staff were asleep the first morning we went down but the second morning found a fresh crew and fantastic service. Don't order espresso there but there are several cafes in the vicinity that serve superb coffee.",4,2013,08,12
204,"Great location, friendly staff, very modern","My boyfriend and I traveled to Ireland for the first time, starting in Dublin and the Fitzwilliam definitely set the bar high for the rest of our trip.  First recommendation - book directly through the hotel - you get better service and the possible discounted rate doesn't make up for the difference.  We stayed from 7/30-8/2 then again for one night on 8/6 and had two entirely different experiences.  Our very spacious room was on the 4th floor, facing the courtyard.  The charming woman who checked us in, Elga, showed us how the room worked, she was lovely and really made us feel at home.  As New Yorkers, we made the mistake the first night of not going to dinner until 10pm - most kitchens in Dublin close at 9pm.  We did find a Thai restaurant, Tigre on Dawson Street that helped us out,  the following nights the concierge was extremely helpful in making suggestions and making reservations for us.  The hotel is right across from St. Stephen's Green which is beautiful and steps away from Grafton street, one of the major shopping streets, and about half a block from the hop on/hop off bus, all very convenient.  Overall a chic hotel with warm, friendly staff.",5,2013,08,11
204,"Nice, Modern, Central","We had a room of the 7th floor, with a small balcony overlooking St. Stephens Green park.  The room was comfortable and spacious by European standards.  Our travel agent selected the hotel based on its location (just off the pedestrian zone in central Dublin, in walking distances of the main attractions, restaurants, and of course pubs).  Staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly, including the breakfast servers.  Breakfast was included in our rate, and consisted of hot and cold buffets, as well as made to order items such as omelets and pancakes.  The menu at the main restaurant, on the other hand, did not inspire us, despite its good reviews
, so we did not eat there..",4,2013,08,07
204,Wonderful luxurious hotel in an excellent location,"I took my fiance here for her 30th and we loved it. We took a superior room on the top floor with our own little balcony/terrace area overlooking St Stephen's Green. The room was very chic, very modern, but very comfortable, albeit quite tight in size. Perhaps a little too much purple if I was looking for something to criticise! I'd mentioned it was a special occasion and a happy birthday message and chocolates had been left in the room on our arrival, which was nice of the staff, who were all very helpful throughout.",5,2013,08,06
204,A Warm Friendly Hotel in a Bustling City,"Helpful beyond words. Nothing was too much trouble. It was my first holiday away alone with my teenage girls. Mother daughter weekend. The 3 nights we stayed The Fitzwilliam Concierge made sure we were kept busy and entertained! From busy shopping on Grafton Street, Horse & Carriage rides viewing the sites & Dublin Zoo..to Fresh Dublin Bay Scampi at King Sitric on the Irish Coast & Irish dancing at the Merry Ploughboy.. We did it all !! Without the concierge's assistance our time in Dublin wouldn't have been half as fun or exciting. For this we thank them.
The hotel room was spacious, extremely comfortable and offered everything you could possibly require which made our stay a warm well cared for experience. Nothing was too much trouble in this hotel and service was always with a smile and efficient. My daughters are looking forward to returning here again in the future which is something coming from 16yr olds! THANK YOU X",5,2013,08,05
204,Almost perfect,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel on the Saturday night of the August Bank Holiday. It was a special occasion for us and the hotel very kindly gave us a room with a balcony overlooking the park and a welcome message accompanied with chocolate cake. We dined in the Citron restaurant, the food and the service was excellent, I would strongly recommend it for a pre theatre meal. We really enjoyed our stay and the staff were very helpful and friendly. On the down side, when we were checking in I asked the receptionist what time breakfast was served, she told us it was up to 10:30 am. The next morning at breakfast we thought the staff were particularly lenient as people were strolling in at 11:00 plus. We later learned that Sunday breakfast is served up to 12:00am. We could have had a nice Sunday morning lie-in. The other negative was, as we were checking out a young man was stretched out asleep on a settee in the foyer in full view of the concierge, reminiscent of a railway station. Not a good image for the Fitzwilliam.",4,2013,08,05
204,Great Location and Service,"We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and it would be somewhere we would stay again.  We had a lovely room overlooking the park and a balcony which we could enjoy a drink and the gorgeous weather.  It is central to the main shopping mall with many pubs, cafes and restaurants around the area to choose from. Great wifi service, room amenities and comfy bed. Breakfast was good with a variety of foods to suit everyone's taste.  The concierge, Patrick Fitzgibbon was our standout service provider.  We needed to communicate with him prior to our arrival and true to his word, everything was perfect.",5,2013,08,04
204,Great Location but..,"Stayed in the hotel very recently and it has a great location.  However for a 5 star hotel, I was disappointed that our room had a shower curtain!  I absolutely hate these and really a shower panel should be the norm.  Also a cracked tile behind the toilet and in the bar quite a few stains in the carpet.  Just a few quibbles!  The bedrooms are very comfortable and would definitely stay again.",5,2013,08,03
204,only need a belt,"great room, Excellent service overall. Only issue... dining area has an open window into the kitchen. We went for dinner 1st night, Food was very good. But... the cook had on loose fitting blue jeans, and when ever he bent over, he exposed the crack of his rear end... Now what I like to see during my meal... disgusting... Maybe give him a raise so he can afford a belt",5,2013,08,01
204,"A perfect place to stay in Dublin, exceeding expectations at all levels","I loved our stay at Fitzwilliam, hotel is simply beautiful, modern with a brilliant touch of tradition. The room and bathroom are fantastic, bed is very comfortable. You will love the tasteful decorations, the room is so cosy that it makes you want to stay there for as long as you can. The team is fantastic. The great team of concierges is simply stellar - they are at your service, so ask them whatever you want to know about Dublin, they know it as their own pocket! Special thanks to Polish concierge (I lost the name, Janusz?) who was extremely helpful and kind. 
The hotel is brilliantly organized, there is even a small but a well equipped gym, moreover this hotel is ideally situated if you love to explore the new town by jogging - then hit St. Stephen's Green park first.
Food is magnificent as well, very tasty, fresh, and the choice is also very good. 
I cannot find the slightest negative comment about this place. It is simply EXCELLENT. If only we had such hotels in Belgium..
I recommend everyone to stay at Fitzwilliam, you will not regret it and it's really worth the price.",5,2013,07,30
204,Excellent Hotel!,"Everyone at this hotel is super nice, and willing to help any way they can. It is a great location, close to all shopping, pubs, sightseeing etc, yet very quiet at night and very safe.  Would stay again in a minute. We were there 8 nights. This hotel is worth every penny.",5,2013,07,28
204,"Awesome Hotel in Dublin, Ireland!","Fitzwilliam Hotel was a Great Hotel to have stayed in.   Very Luxurious!  Friendly staff!  Not exactly in the middle of town though but CLOSE to a MAJOR Shoping center Street (Grafton Street).

Definately worth staying at!",5,2013,07,28
204,Perfect Dublin Hotel,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night at the end of a trip around Ireland.  What a great choice!  The bed was comfy, the service was great (including a nice suggestion from the concierge about a dinner restaurant), it had very nice bathroom, and the location was stellar.  When I was in Dublin, the weather had been unusually hot the entire week.  The AC in our room was cranked up, which was awesome.  The rest of the hotel was on the warm side, but inside my room was perfect.  It was a wonderful place to end our trip.",5,2013,07,25
204,Very nice,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay at this hotel.  The location is great, close to shopping, restaurants, and all of the tourist attractions.  Chocolates every night on your bed and the body wash was pleasing.  The staff is very friendly and the room was very nice and comfortable.  I don't have any complaints and would recommend this hotel.",5,2013,07,25
204,Great Location,"This hotel is located on the west side of St. Stephen's Green and is in the perfect location to walk everywhere in Dublin.  We stayed in a Signature room and it was nice and comfortable.  The staff was very friendly (other than one guy at the front desk), but I won't hold it against the hotel.  I would recommend this place.",4,2013,07,25
204,great place to stay,"we sandwiched a two week trip to Ireland with a 2 day stay at the beginning, and a 1 day stay at the very end at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin. the location is ideal, being on one corner of St. Stephens Green. the Luas light rail train has one line that begins right outside the front door, and Grafton street is right around the corner! we were wowed by our welcome upon both arrivals, both at 6 am, coming from the airport, and at noon on our last day of our trip. the concierge services were outstanding, especially Viktor, who made sure we had reservations for afternoon tea at a competing hotel for our last day, even before we left for our around Ireland travels.  
the rooms were very comfortable, we had a twin bedded room both times. there was a fresh orchid in our room upon our arrival, and chocolates were delivered mid afternoon, with a note welcoming us to the hotel. turndown service with more chocolates was another service provided!. there were nice terry cloth robes in the bathroom, slippers were in a cupboard, and all the possible amenities provided in the bath, including a tub deep enough to have a really nice soak, plenty of hot water, and a hand held shower along with the regular shower. they provided an iron, ironing board, and a pants press, and included a small sewing kit, shoe polish kit and qtips as one of the regular items. bottled water was in the cash bar, but offered for free, and a tea set and kettle was found in one of the many cupboards! 
breakfast daily was one of the best we found in ireland, sundays they have a more complete buffet set up with hot dishes, but during the week anything you could possibly want could be ordered from the kitchen.  some of the best scones we had were at the Fitzwilliam, and they had excellent service from very friendly staff in the breakfast room. we also enjoyed a light lunch on our last day in the bar, where the staff was also very welcoming and friendly, and the food was excellent! definitely a place i can recommend with no reservation!
oh and another thing we liked, the AC was excellent, which we appreciated on the 80+ degree days with no rain we experienced for 2 weeks in Ireland!",5,2013,07,25
204,Great stay.,"Stayed here for a night at the beginning of June... fantastic location at the top of Grafton Street,great parking under the hotel (Bit tricky to find but its behind the college of surgeons carpark entrance) and rooms(we were in rm 552 looking onto the courtyard)&staff were lovely....I would definately look forward to staying another time when in the Capital and highly recommend.",4,2013,07,24
204,Walking Distance to Lotsa Touristy Areas,"The hotel was ok. Nice, clean, basic room. Nice use of small space. Good interior design. (One thing I also liked was that the safe can accommodate taking in a Mac.) The people at the reception and the concierge were all very accommodating and nice. Very helpful. What I liked about the hotel is that it is just walking distance from the must-see places in Dublin for tourists. Very near the theater where they had ""Riverdance."" Walking distance from numerous pubs, restaurants, churches, the castle, St. Stephen's Green.",4,2013,07,23
204,Excellent hotel-great location,"My husband and I stayed for one night in the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin.  It is situated on St. Stephen's Green - great location for shopping on Grafton Street! I chose this hotel as I had previously stayed in the Fitzwilliam in Belfast and was happy with my stay there.  We booked a dinner package using the hotel's website.
We parked our car at the front door and valet parking was provided-at an extra cost of €10.  We checked in and were shown to our room.  Features of the room were explained-mini bar with complementary water, CD player, safe, air conditioning, etc. Very clean and comfortable double room with plenty of space.  Fresh flowers provided.  Modern and clean bathroom with good quality toiletries and plenty of mirrors.  Robes and slippers were provided also.  Minor detail-the towels could have been of better quality/fluffier.
We ate in the Citron Restaurant-pre-theatre menu as we were attending the Michael Buble concert in the O2 and had to leave early.  The menu was limited-3 choices for starter, main and dessert, but the food was excellent.  Service in the restaurant was excellent also. 
While we were at the concert, our room was checked and a couple of chocolates left on the pillow-nice touch.
The next morning we had breakfast-plenty of delicious choices.  Good service again.  Check out at 12pm-quick process.  We collected our car from the basement and headed home after an enjoyable stay.  We would recommend this hotel and would stay again.",5,2013,07,22
204,Nice Property; Great Location,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights over a weekend in July.  Reception was efficient and pleasant even though our room was not available when we arrived at 11 AM.  Our room was lovely with a view of St. Stephens Park and a balcony.  The air conditioning worked great in spite of the unseasonal heat then prevailing in Dublin.

Location is great.  Across the street from the park and a very short walk to Grafton Street with lots of shops and restaurants.  

Service at the hotel was great.  We had breakfast in the restaurant every day.  Food was good, service pleasant and efficient.  Concierges were helpful and knowledgeable.

All in all a positive experience.",4,2013,07,21
204,Wonderful hotel: Great location and fantastic service!,"We stayed at this hotel for business in July, 2013.  I would highly recommend it to all considering it.  It is in a great location - within walking distance to all sorts of attractions (Trinity College, Downtown Dublin, great pubs, restaurants, etc..) and across the street from the St. Stephens Green Luas (train) stop.  Bonus: there is also a Starbucks and grocery store around the corner!

In addition to the location, the service at the Fitzwilliam is outstanding...some of the best service we have ever received.  Every time we had a question or a need, it was answered immediately.  At one point, we needed a converter for our flat iron. We called the front desk and requested one, and they had someone at our door in less than two minutes.  Every request that we had was dealt with efficiently and in a friendly way.

The room was spacious (by European standards) and modern.  We had a room that overlooked the garden, so it was quiet and peaceful.

If you are traveling to Dublin and looking for a centrally located hotel with great service, this is the place to stay.",5,2013,07,21
204,"Good hotel, centrally located","We always tend to stay at the Fitzwilliam when in Dublin on business. It is very centrally located and has a boutique feel about it. Service is generally very good although checking in and out can take some time if you are unlucky to arrive when there are a few people already doing so. 
Rooms are reasonable size and are well equipped. Beds and pillows are extremely comfy.
One piece of advice, stay away from rooms on the second floor numbered 230 and above. I have stayed in two of these rooms and there is noise from 5:30 onwards of trolleys being wheeled up and down nearby (I think in the hotel) that lasts for about an hour.",4,2013,07,17
204,"Fantastic location, cool decor, and good on the little things","We were originally supposed to stay at Westin Dublin and had to change at the last minute. What a great surprise the Fitzwilliam turned out to be. Location is fantastic - walking distance to several Grafton Street restaurants, at a corner entrance to St. Stephen's Green and right next door to a mall. Rooms are compact, but elegantly decorated in rich plums and greens with built in window seats and a roomy tub. Candles and nightly chocolates a nice touch.",5,2013,07,14
204,"Great Location, Great Hotel","I stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in April for a business trip. We arrived around 5AM Dublin time from Boston on a Saturday morning and were quite pleased that our early check-in requests could be honored and we could catch a bit of shut eye before trying to get out and see the sights.
The hotel staff brought over tea and coffee for us while we waited for maybe 15 minutes in the lobby while they got all 4 of us into our rooms.

The location is great, as others have mentioned.  St. Stephens Green is right across from the hotel, which is a great park for a short walk or run in between work and dinner plans.
Grafton Street is right there with plenty of restaurants and shopping.
The hotel is within a 10 minute walk of the Temple Bar District, which is a great area to hang out any night. Plenty of great bars and restaurants in the area.

The rooms were comfortable.  Very clean and modern.
There was a breakfast buffet available at the hotel as well which was very convenient and had a decent variety available.

I would definitely stay here or recommend this to hotels to others.

One note with regard to getting to the hotel, we took a cab from the airport and were not able to get a cab which took credit cards.  Something to keep in mind.",4,2013,07,14
204,Highly recommend & can't wait to come back to stay again!!,"Super clean room, wonderful concierge always willing to take time & thoroughly explain. Delicious food. Always friendly & cheerful staff. Rivals any hotel I've ever stayed in Vegas! Glorious all the way around!!!!",5,2013,07,14
204,Fabulous!,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for four days with our grown children and had an absolutely fabulous time.  The hotel staff was top notch, even better than many of the 5 star hotels we've stayed in while in New York.  Attention to the little things, like candles in the bathroom and chocolates in the room each evening, made the stay extra special.  I highly recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone visiting Dublin!",5,2013,07,13
204,Fabulous Dublin Hotel,"I highly recommend this hotel.  The Fitzwilliam takes hospitality to a new level with it's top-notch amenities, friendly and professional staff and comfortable yet luxurious guest rooms.  Anything that we needed during our stay, we could depend upon the staff to assist us.  I will definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam in the future!",5,2013,07,13
204,Great hotel,"Highly recommended hotel.

The service was great throughout, with friendly and helpful staff that made our stay (with a toddler) a lot easier than we were expecting. (E.g. they put us in a quiet section at the back of the hotel without being asked, which was much appreciated when you're trying to get the wee one to sleep).

Location is excellent - right by St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. We'll definitely be staying here again the next time we're in Dublin.",5,2013,07,12
204,Family Ireland Vacation,"The staff and hotel were always more than accommodating.  Whether it was water, charger, a compressor for my blow dryer and straitening iron, the provided it.  And I assure you that if they didn't have it, they would find a way to get it.  They brought my 8 yr. old twins a cookie snack every evening, and one time they didn't bring chocolate chip only chocolate.  My daughter asked me to call to see if she could have chocolate chip instead.  I called, however they were out.  But they more than graciously offered to hold and they would go buy her some.  I did decline the very nice offer.  But they will go out of their way to make your stay a 5 STAR  Wow.  Amazing...",5,2013,07,10
204,Enjoyed our stay,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Fitzwilliam at the end of our three week trip to Europe.  We were very pleased with the hotel.  There were four of us, my husband and myself and our two teenage sons.  We had a family room, which consisted of a king size bed, a double sleeper sofa and a window seat that was long and wide enough for a child (even a 16 year old boy) to sleep on.  The beds were very comfortable, the room was clean, and the complimentary water was much appreciated.  The staff were all helpful and kind.  We appreciated the fast elevators.  We never waited for more than one minute for one to arrive, and they are high speed so they take you quickly to your floor.  We thought the location was great-just off the end of Grafton Street, nice and quiet but right next to plenty of shopping and restaurants and across from pretty St. Stephen's Green.  My husband travelled to Dublin a few months ago for business and stayed at the Radisson Blu.  He preferred the Fitzwilliam and said he would stay here if he returns to Dublin for work.",4,2013,07,05
204,"Lovely hotel, great location","Recently stayed here overnight on a business trip to Dublin. The hotel was very good, with a great juxtaposition between the legacy of history in the area and the modern, trendy (but not ugly) interior design.

The room was a very good size, with ample space for work and even a kind of recliner bench by the window. Separate bathroom, comfy bed, mini-bar, iron and ironing board already in-room in a cupboard (always annoys me when I have to phone down for this).

The staff were friendly and polite, and the bar downstairs has a pleasant ambience I thought, as travellers arrive after their day's work for a drink before heading out in the evening.

The location is brilliant - right opposite St Stephen's Green, with Grafton Street a 20 second walk away - you'll have plenty of options for evening entertainment with all the bars, restaurants, clubs and shops around, or you can go an relax on the Green itself if you're lucky enough to see some sunshine and blue skies.

The only negative for me was the breakfast the next morning - firstly, it wasn't included in my room rate (although I was told it was when I checked in the day before), but I didn't actually complain about it so the hotel had no chance to remedy the issue, in fairness. Secondly, it seems service was a little slack...waited 10 minutes to be seated whilst waitrons folded napkins in full view of me standing there, my colleague's food arrived about 5 minutes after mine which was then cold, and the breakfast was decent but nothing to write home about. Not awful, but perhaps a bit of an off day for the restaurant staff.

In any event, a really nice place that's easy to immediately feel comfortable and relaxed in. I'd highly recommend it for business or pleasure, short or longer stays.",4,2013,07,05
204,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I stayed here during our trip to Dublin.  Booked the hotel through a Costco travel package.  Absolutely fabulous hotel!  From the moment we arrived, the staff was very attentive and nice.  We asked if there was a king bed available, and they gave us a free upgrade to a king room with a balcony overlooking the park.  Decor is modern and very nice.  Rooms are very clean also.  Location couldn't be better.  It is located on the edge of one of the main parks in Dublin and at the end of one of the main shopping streets.  Overall, great experience!",5,2013,07,05
204,"Good hotel, Great Location, Amazing Staff","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights and loved it! The location allowed you to walk almost anywhere you need to visit while touring Dublin, and the décor/restaurants were great! The rooms were beautiful and comfortable, and my only complaint would be that the fantastic shower would always seem to leave a lake on the bathroom floor. I learned to make a small dam with a spare towel. The hotel staff, bartenders and waiters/waitresses were all friendly, helpful, and even at times, playful!",5,2013,07,03
204,Loved it!,"Stayed here during a business trip.  Great location, right on the west side of Stephen's Green, and just steps away from Grafton Street.  Great hotel restaurant, nice sized room, excellent service all around. No complaints.  I had nothing but great memories through out and would definitely stay here next time.",5,2013,07,01
204,Geat Hotel,"In late March and early April 2013 we stayed at the Fitzwilliam the night of our arrival in Ireland and for 3 consecutive nights at the end of our trip.  I booked two delux premium rooms adjacent to each other on the courtyard side of the building, each with a small patio.  Our room was quite comfortable with a wonderful bed and nice shower bath. The breakfast was quite good and we ate in the restaurant on the last night we were in Dublin finding it excellent.  The  reception staff, maid staff and the staff who greeted us at the door were all very accomodating.  The hotel is on St. Stephan's Green, close to excellent restaurants, and very near Grafton St.  This was the second visit to this hotel and we will return for another.",5,2013,06,30
204,The service at the Fitzwilliam is Superior!!!,"The service at this hotel is unbelievably fantastic!  From the front desk, to the concierge, to the room staff everyone does a truly outstanding job.  So friendly and seemingly genuinely wanting to help.  Umbrellas to borrow (not buy or rent) available at the front door.  The location of this hotel is also wonderful.  Walking distance to many attractions with the concierge ready with a map to help out.  We had a jr suite and it was lovely.  Really big bathroom and room with sitting area.  A good value for European standards.  Also the linens in our room were fabulous.",5,2013,06,30
204,Great Hotel,"I stayed 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam in mid May.  We were on a golfing vacation and this was the perfect headquarters.  The hotel rooms are very nicely appointed and the beds are very comfortable. The rooms came with all the amenities I would expect from a 5 star hotel.

The location is fabulous.  You can walk to everything Dublin has to offer.  The staff is very warm and welcoming.  The front desk went out of their way to be sure we were welcome.  Tony at the bell stand is the best.  If you want something, need to know something or are just looking for a kind word, see Tony.

We played some great golf courses near Dublin during the day, had all the attractions Dublin offered and slept in a wonderful 5 star hotel each night.  We used Dublin Chauffeurs to drive us to golf everyday.  They were great.

I am looking forward to my next trip to the William, you will too.",5,2013,06,28
204,great hotel,"Myself and my niece stayed there for one night excellent hotel and the staff were really helpful and friendly. Much better than The Gresham. The Hotel is in a great position within Dublin to get out and about and see the sites and also for to enjoy the nightlife on offer in Dublin.
I would love to go back and have a longer stay at this excellent hotel .
      ",5,2013,06,26
204,"Outstanding Staff, Perfect central location.","Having stayed in lots of Dublin Hotels, and others worldwide; I cannot emphasise how perfect the staff where.....
From the moment of arrival to leaving, staff where very attentive. 

Perfect location overlooking St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. All the fab shops, restaurants and night life right on your doorstep.

Food was amazing and suited all budgets from Michelin Star, to very enjoyable Bar food.  ",5,2013,06,23
204,Great place to stay,"We stayed fro 10 nights over Christmas and New Year and we looked after by the well known Irish hospitality.

Greta location in the centre of Dublin easily within walking distance of shops and bars with its own private car park.

Will use this hotel again when we undoubtedly return to Dublin in the future.",4,2013,06,23
204,Great hotel and great location,The hotel is in a prime location. It is very close to graft on street and lots of pubs and restaurants. The hotel itself was very clean with many amenities and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would absolutely stay here again.,5,2013,06,23
204,Nice place to stay in Dublin,"We stayed at this property in May. We had a hard time driving to the front door, so finally we had to park the car and walk to the hotel. The bell captain graciously offered to walk back with my husband to bring the car to their car park. And in the rain, too! We were upgraded to a very nice suite. However, it was on the 6th floor and the elevator only goes to the 5th floor. We had to use steps to get to our room. For one night, that was fine, but wouldn't want to do that for more than a night since I have arthritis in my knees. They did ask if the steps were okay and we said sure for the one night. They were also very gracious in allowing us an early check in as we had flown overnight from the US and were desperately in need of a shower. 
The room was clean and nicely appointed. Bed was very comfortable. 
The hotel is in a great location, overlooking St. Stephens Green and very close to Grafton Street. We managed to walk wherever we needed to go. We did not eat at the restaurant.
We would stay here again.",4,2013,06,22
204,Friendly and upmarket but some mistakes,"We booked for four days (€350 a night), and the room was nice and the staff very friendly. However, they made several mistakes on room service, one of which was repeated after pointing it out on a previous night. Overall, not bad.",3,2013,06,20
204,An oasis,"We stayed here on our first night in Dublin and it was an oasis after being jet lagged and touring all day. Located on St. Stephen's Green, the Fitzwilliam is a quiet, private luxury hotel within easy walking distance to Dublin's attractions.The staff went out of their way to help us. We could not have been more pleased.",5,2013,06,19
204,First class!,"A lovely hotel, in a beautiful location in central Dublin.  Staff are welcoming and helpful, rooms are impeccably clean and roomy.  My room was on the top floor with a roof terrace and a view over St Stephen's green - idyllic.  Breakfast was of a very high quality.  I couldn't fault it.",5,2013,06,18
204,Outstanding City Center Hotel,"This is the third time we haved stayed in the Fitzwilliam. We went down to Dublin for a weekend and wanted something central with a little bit of luxury and comfort. 

Yet again the hotel did not disappoint. We just dropped the car at the front door and all was taken care of. We had a bite to eat in the bar before we hit Grafton st. The Luas Line is just outside the front door of the hotel, as is the main shopping street in the city. 

I really enjoyed staying here. Some of the highlights;
Cocktail bar.
Huge, comfy beds.
The decor in the rooms.
Food (Late breakfast on Sunday morning)
The 5 star service from staff. (Especially Cora)

It all adds up to being the best hotel in Dublin.",5,2013,06,18
204,Fantastical location near everything in downtown .,We came in the early morning on a Sunday and the staff did everything possible to get us in our rooms prior to the 3pm checking time. They were great. We had five people and used two rooms. Great comfy beds! Clean clean clean. Great stay.,5,2013,06,17
204,Fabulous Hotel in an envious location,"My husband and I stayed in the beautiful 5 star Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin last Saturday night while attending a concert in the City.  We loved the funky modern decor and furnishings.  The bedrooms were bright and spacious with everything you could wish for, including gorgeous window seats over-looking the garden.  The food was delicious and a great variety. The staff were so accommodating and friendly. The location of this Hotel is superb. It is right beside Stephen's Green, all the shops and bars.  Having stayed several times in Fitzwilliam in Belfast, we will definately be returning to Fitzwilliam Dublin and have already booked our next stay!!",5,2013,06,17
204,super comfy bed!,"stayed at the Fitzwilliam for just 1 night recently and the rooms are lovely, quite spacious and with nice fixtures/fittings.

The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in and the shower was amazing!!

Great Irish breakfast the next morning and staff who are polite and helpful.

A great choice for a day or 2 in Dublin!!",4,2013,06,14
204,Fab hotel,"Pricey, but excellent. Food second to none, location is excellent,  staff very helpful, bar comfy,  walk out of hotel into great buzz on street, yet you can't hear this in hotel.  Great night club next door the dandelion,  shop till you drop just a walk away",5,2013,06,11
204,"Very Nice, centrally located Dublin 5 Star","Perfect location at the top end of Grafton Street overlooking St Stephen's Green. Public areas and rooms what you'd expect of this Conran designed hotel. We had one of the top graded rooms on the 5th floor with a four posted bed and most delightful balcony overlooking the green. Given the weekend we just visited the sun was shining constantly with temps in the 70's, the balcony was delightful. Service good, food good. Bathrooms large, rooms a tad small but perfectly acceptable and well furnished and maintained.",4,2013,06,11
204,Ideal location,Choosing where to stay on the internet can be a hit and miss affair but this hotel lived up to its positive reviews and is in a perfect location in Dublin . Arriving on a Saturday we were unable to get dinner in the hotel so the Concierge arranged dinner at a restaurant a short walk away which was much appreciated . We were part of a bustling crowd with a busy trade being done in pubs and restaurants but it was good to walk around in the evening as the hotel is certainly in the heart of Dublin . The rooms are a good size with a courtyard view and a very comfortable king sized bed . Complimentary cocktails in the bar on Sunday night were much appreciated and it was a perfect finish to an enjoyable stay .,5,2013,06,09
204,"Great Location!, Heavenly Beds!","My husband & I stayed here for 2 nights in April. We arrived very early after a long flight from Australia. We caught the Aircoach bus from the airport for 7 euros each. We had a 10 minute walk from the bus stop to the hotel, but it was quite an easy walk with our wheeled luggage.
We couldn't check it as it was only 9am, but the friendly lady on the front desk organized for our luggage to be stored & we set out on foot to explore the sites.
We arrived back after lunch & checked in. Our room wasn't large, but it was very nicely decorated & clean & very comfortable. The beds & pillows are heavenly & the linen is of a good quality.
Bathroom is small but not uncomfortably so. There is a magnifying mirror for making up or shaving, as well as the big mirror. This is always a plus for me! The other thing that I loved about our room, was the time that was displayed under the flat screen TV. Great for those times when you wake up in the middle of the night, disoriented after travelling a distance & in another time zone & you have no idea what the time is. Both my husband & I could see the display easily if we woke during the night, but it wasn't at all intrusive.
On our second day in Dublin, the weather was a bit variable & we really appreciated the umbrellas left at the front door, for the use of the guests. A really nice touch! We were always greeted by the enthusiastic & friendly doorman when leaving or arriving back at the hotel & the rooms have an evening turn down service with the added bonus of a chocolate each, left in the room.
I can't comment on the breakfast, as it wasn't part of our accommodation package & after reading the mixed reviews from fellow tripadvisers, we decided to eat breakfast at a cafe behind the hotel.
We were picking up a hire car from the airport & we caught the aircoach back to the airport. The bus stop for going back to the airport was much closer to the hotel, just a 2 minute walk & at just 7 euro it was very good value. It runs frequently & was a comfortable ride!
I would definitely stay at this hotel again, both for the great location & the heavenly beds & the friendly atmosphere & service.",4,2013,06,08
204,First Class Service & Location,"As a regular visitor to Dublin I could not find any faults with my stay.  I arrived late but despite this was welcomed by very friendly & easy going staff (despite the 5 star hotel rating - which I liked) who bent over backwards to make my short stay incredible.

The rooms are well appointed, I would recommend the roof top suites overlooking the park, after a long trip sitting on  the balcony enjoying a quiet pint while the sun set over the park is a great way to unwind after a long trip.

I only stayed for breakfast (which was very good - a wide choice) but again service was first class & overall I look forward to staying again, albeit longer & next time I plan to bring my wife to enjoy the stay.

Cam",5,2013,06,07
204,Amazing Service,"My husband and I drove in to Dublin from a long day traveling Ireland.  We pulled up to The Fitzwilliam Hotel and in minutes someone was unloading our bags as we checked in.  Shortly we were up in our room, courtyard view( not great but could put up with it) relaxing.   The staff here is the best!  They are there whenever you need them , opened doors, a greeting each time we returned after day in Dublin.   The area is great for exploring Dublin, just steps to public transportation and shopping area.   The park is right there and you can enjoy its beauty when you have had enough of the shopping!   The room was clean, very attractive and bed was comfortable.  There is free wifi in this hotel for your stay.   There is do much to do in Dublin and this hotel really made our stay there wonderful!   We had one staff member , he helped us on our arrival and helped us at departure.  He escorted us at departure to back of hotel due to parade festivities in Dublin, we sat comfortable in lobby until Taxi arrived.  He saw us off as we drove off in Taxi.   We can not say anything bad about this hotel!   We were even able to hook our iPod into the speakers in our room , speakers throughout room, nice touch for romance!  Turn down service each night, with chocolates too....so nice.",5,2013,06,06
204,"Great hotel, amazing location","I picked this hotel on the basis of its location and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is 1 minute walk from Grafton Street and facing the beautiful St Stephens Green. You are 2-3 minutes walk away for all the bars, shops and restaurants you are ever going to need. If you are looking for a night in the famous Temple Bar Area it is about 10 minutes walk, just head up Grafton Street and bear left at the top!). Taxis, tram and buses all close at hand if needed.

The hotel itself is also high quality, it is incredibly quiet despite the central location and manages to provide a bend of style and friendless. The bar is a great place for a relaxing drink and there are two restaurants including the Michelin starred Thornton's. I can't comment on breakfast as I tried one of the many cafes in the area. Check in was fast and efficient.

The room was of average size for a 5 star hotel and overlooked a large and well laid out inner garden area. It was stylish in design, well equipped and immaculately clean with a nightly turn-down service including complimentary chocolates. The room had blinds and curtains which was appreciated.

In all I cant find  fault, so yes, I would definitely book here again.",5,2013,06,05
204,FitzAWESOME,"We spent our anniversary here and had a really nice time. The locations is perfect, right across from a beautiful park and right next to one of the best walking streets in Dublin. The service was excellent and there is no need to keep looking for hotels...this is where you want to stay!",5,2013,06,01
204,Service with a smile....,"I stayed here recently on a short trip and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.I work in the industry myself so my standards are high.  Located directly in city centre and next door to St Stephans greene, it provides a great base for shopping and exploring the city. Check in was highly effecient by a lovely lady who explained all the details of hotel thoroughly with a smile. We were then roomed by a lovely man who gave us an orientation of the hotels facilities. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was fab. We were upgraded to a lovely room with a balcony which gave us a spectalar view of Dublin. We rang down to reception a few times and each time the responce was prompt and effecient. We dined in the bar and restaurant on two separate occasions and each time the food was delicious. Check out again by the same lovely lady who remembered us by name. There are a few 5* hotels in the area but the exceptional service provided by the staff makes this hotel a cut above the rest. By far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. I cant wait to return!",5,2013,05,30
204,A Hotel That Lives up to its Rating,"The Fitzwilliam is a property that is everything a five star hotel should be. The rooms are comfortable and modern. The only drawback is some of the rooms lack an armchair and have a upholstered bench instead.

The staff is experienced and well trained. The staff goes out of their way to make sure  you have everything you need. The bellman/concierge are very good on recommendations and problem solving.

I think the rooms that face St. Stephen's Green are nice but can be noisy on weekends. The rooms that look in to the courtyard are smaller but quieter. We spent a recent weekend in Dublin at the Fitzwilliam when the rugby finals were on and were glad to be in a quieter room.

The hotel bar is nice and a good place to meet with friends. The hotel lobby is the opposite, it is small and very tight. Service is the bar was quick and friendly.

The hotel is located on the south side of central Dublin and within walking distance of Trinity, many of the Gov't building and museums, restaurants and Temple Bar. Easy access to LUAS and fairly close to the train stations to catch DART.

All in all almost everything you want in a hotel.",5,2013,05,30
204,"Pricey, but very good","I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for four evenings while in Dublin on business.  It's a pricey hotel, but very good.  The service was impeccable.  In particular, the concierge staff were outstanding.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and well maintained.  The hotel is a very well-done blend of old and new.

The lobby was very comfortable and I was able to conduct several unscheduled, but very productive and private, meetings in a quiet corner near the fireplace.

The breakfast and dining area are small, and the menu and options are limited, but the quality was excellent.

The location was ideal for me on this trip.  Almost all of my meetings and social gatherings were within walking distance of St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street and Trinity.

Despite the extra expense, if you want to be near the center of Dublin, I recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin.",4,2013,05,30
204,Bank Holiday Weekend,"Hotel was in a great location. Cost of rooms is high, but good deals can be got through third parties on the internet.
Everything is within walking distance, but the hotel has its own secure carpark and if you book prior to your stay, its a discounted rate of 10 euros a day which is charged to your room.
Check though as i had two rooms and i had been charged for parking on both rooms even though we had only one car. Reception removed this without any question",5,2013,05,29
204,Amazing Stay at a Beautiful Hotel,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin with my boyfriend this weekend, its located in the centre of Dublin and just across from St Stephens Green. We were upgraded to a Deluxe room with balcony which had a beautiful view of the city and park. The staff couldn't do enough for us and the room was spotless. The hotel has great style and is very modern, with a boutique feel. If you want a lovely hotel in a great central location- this is the hotel for you! I wanted to book something special as it was my boyfriends birthday weekend - it was definitely worth the money and in my opinion great value.",5,2013,05,28
204,Great spot for our Honeymoon,"The Fitzwilliam offered a great location for our first trip to Dublin.  Situated right across from the park and just down the street from shopping and lots of pubs and restaraunts.  My husband and I enjoyed the clean, comfortable atmosphere provided by the hotel.  The conceirge were very helpful in locating a local football game to go to, where to head for dinner, amongst other things.  We were also impressed with the buffet, a true Irish breakfast feast daily.",5,2013,05,28
204,peaceful oasis in city centre,"This is a fabulous hotel, great location right in the city centre but with none of the city noise as all the rooms seem to face onto a quiet garden area t the back. Breakfast is delicious. If you can afford it, I would definitely recommend it.",5,2013,05,26
204,In the hearth of Dublin,"This is a fantastic hotel, it's close to everything in downtown Dublin, you can take a walk to the park, take the Viking Tour or any of the Hop On-Hop Off buses you can find in front of te park (I personally recommend the red one and not the green one, when you are there you'll what I mean). 
You have the main shopping street on the left filled with stores and restaurants, you can even find a Starbucks and a Burgerking.
Temple bar is almost a walking distance but there are plenty of  taxis on bikes around. 
The train station is also close and you can take the train to Malahi Castle and the Light House. ",5,2013,05,19
204,Excellent hotel in the Centre of Dublin,"What a great choice of hotel.  We were traveling to Dublin for my partners birthday so I asked for some arrangements in room upon arrival.  The hotel correspondence was excellent thanks to Nuno.  We arrived a little early so left our luggage at hotel and went for some lunch in grafton street.  They phoned us an hour later to advise room was ready.  We had a beautiful room with a balcony overlooking st stephens green. They left a nice happy birthday chocolate message which was a nice touch.  The room was nicely decorated with a little noisy but excellent air con.  The bed was extreme comfortable and we both had excellent nights sleeps.
The location could not be better at the corner of st stephens green with grafton street a few steps away.  The cocktails at the bar are a little expensive but good.  Breakfast is also a little step at €22 especially when there are lots of options a few yards away on grafton street.
Overall an excellent stay, beautiful comfortable rooms and you cant beat the location.  They also offer some good rates if booked in advance.",5,2013,05,19
204,Top Class Hotel in the Center of Dublin,"Just returned from a 5 day business trip to Dublin and stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Unassuming from the outside, but top notch service on the inside. From the helpful doorman and concierge to the breakfast waitstaff, everyone greeted us with a smile, a welcome and the assistance we needed. We were a large party, about 20, including several government dignitaries, and everyone was happy with the property and the service.

Great location on St. Stephen's Green, convenient to shopping, pubs, Trinity College, etc.  I had an inner room on the courtyard which was quiet and attractive. Definitely recommend a stay the Fitzwilliam.",5,2013,05,17
204,Mind=Blown,"What a fantastic hotel, arrived from Manchester and checked in, located right beside stephens green shopping centre, room was immaculate. Utter bliss reading the Irish times at the fireplace in the lobby, rediscovered my Irish self! Enjoyed a breakfast that can only be described as awesome!! Staff demonstrated an exceptional level of professionalism.",5,2013,05,16
204,Absolutely First Class!,"Can only concur with what has been said before - Hotel is absolutely First Class and Amazing!  All the staff are extremely pleasant and willing to go that extra mile without being too obtrusive - they really are keen to ensure your stay is perfect!   Room excellent with so many ""little touches"" to ensure our stay was comfortable, food in both Citron and Inn on the Green was superb (unfortunately we did not try Thorntons fine dining as we ran out of time!).   Will definitely have to make a return visit and, as it is only an hour or so flight time from Gatwick, we most certainly will be back!   Thank you Fitzwilliam and to your staff.  You fully deserve our praise!",5,2013,05,13
204,Lovely room in beautiful hotel,"Booked one night before I returned via Dublin to New York.  Gorgeous room, quiet and sunny on 5th floor.  Large entry way with hardwood floors.  Large bathroom with deep deep tub and H2O bath products.

Bed was very comfortable in spacious room.  Excellent closet space. Working stereo radio which played in bathroom as well.  Turndown service at night.

Lovely location across from St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street shopping.  Preferred previous location at other hotel on Liffey.

Competent service, beautiful lobby.  All good.",5,2013,05,11
204,an excellent experience!,"My mother, brother, and I recently came to Dublin for a few days-our first trip to Ireland.  I was so impressed with the hotel and the staff that it called for recognition.  The hotel was clean, spacious (not always the case with European hotels), modern, and very comfortable.  Bedding was high end cotton.  The bathroom was quite large and had any amenity you might have forgotten.  Location was terrific-walking ditance to many Dublin sights.
What I wanted to especially recognize was the staff.  I was felt to feel most welcome and they were more than accomodating.  We had a very early flight out one morning and at 4 30 AM, there was a staff member serving me a tray of coffee and cookies in the lobby as I was waiting for our car service.  My brother left some items behind when we left for London and Patrick (concierge) took care of mailing the package right away.  They always engaged in conversation when we left and returned and I always felt comfortable asking them for directions or solving a transportation issue. They go behind their limits to address all of your needs.
i would return to the Fitzwilliam in a heartbeat.",5,2013,05,09
204,"Great service, rooms and food","My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The service was excellent, the rooms were perfectly clean and quiet and the food was great. Particularly liked the Concierge Marcin and other staff member, Tony. Great hotel, centrally located.",5,2013,05,09
204,Excellent location,"Overall a great hotel in a perfect location right in the heart of Dublin. The concierge service is impeccable and they know everything and will go to their limits to help you out with any desire.

The breakfast room is very loud with a low ceiling and inadequate space.

The garden rooms were very nice and quiet however the mattress was so soft that I had to ask for a wooden plank to be placed under the mattress but it was still not enough and resulting in very bad sleep quality.

I would however recommend this hotel just ensure the next time that I ask for a brand new mattress in my room.",4,2013,05,08
204,Weekend Away,"I stayed here with my other half for a Saturday night. I should have booked the 2 nights. The room was top notch, service and staff was excellent without being overly attentive which some luxury hotels can be guilty of. We had breakfast in our room which was great. Views of St. Stephens was the icing on the cake. The location is great for nightlife and restaurants. Keep the good work up!!",5,2013,05,07
204,Not sure what makes this 5*,"I have stayed in all of dublins top hotels and this was my first visit to this hotel. It's not as grand as some of the others and  I'm not sure where the five stars come from.
I booked an upgraded room at the front of the hotel but the room was rather small and not worth paying the extra.
However Brid on the front ðesk was exceptional and I did mention on booking that it was my wife's birthday and there was a nice gift in the room and later that day Brid put a voucher for complimentary cocktails under our door, a really nice touch.
Would I go again for the hotel, probably not as there are better around town but the service was excellent.",4,2013,05,07
204,Outstanding Location and Ambiance,The staff is super friendly and helpful.  The rooms are lovely and the food is absolutely top notch.  Wonderful location - walking distance to Trinity - across from St. Stephen's Green - wish we could have stayed longer...,5,2013,05,03
204,super hotel,"staff were very friendly and efficent and location is amazing for Dublin with the number one shopping area and the best green right on your door step. I dont know if our room was typical but it was superb, beautiful design and layout and we will be back.",5,2013,05,03
204,Incredbible hotel with uber friendly staff,"I fell in love with this hotel, the staff upon arrival were super friendly and helpful.
The room was absolutely fabulous, The only downfall was on my behalf I only stayed one night, would have loved to stay longer. Highly recommend it",5,2013,05,02
204,"Fabulous location - Classy, Modern Hotel","I recently stayed for 5 nights at the Fitzwilliam with 3 of my top clients.  The location at the top of Grafton Street was perfect for sightseeing and dining at local restaurants. The concierge team was top-notch at recommending restaurants and was even able to help me find a local yoga studio for a quick vinyasa class. I particularly enjoyed being greeted by name each time I entered the hotel.  Other details that will cause me to return to this hotel again:  the catalog of CDs to select from for playing on the in-room stereo, the gorgeous orchid plant, the H2O amenities, and the elegant umbrellas to be borrowed.",5,2013,05,01
204,Best hotel I have stayed in,"It has actually been a while from I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin but I'm only remembering now to write a review.  My husband and I stayed here twice, once for my birthday and the other just a splurge lol.  The staff are friendly, polite and helpful.  On one occasion the guy at the front door offered to park our car for us as we couldn't find the car park, wish I could remember his name.  The rooms are just fantastic with lovely views, great food also.  I really hope that someday soon we will get back to the Fitzwilliam.  Thanks for a lovely pleasant stay.",5,2013,04,30
204,Perfect Location,"We spent a week at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and everything was just perfect. The staff was pleasant and helpful, our room was comfortable and the hotel was local to everything. Shopping was just out the door. The Gaiety Theater was around the corner and there was plenty of restaurants  within walking distance. We saved dining at the Michelin star restaurant Thornton's which is at the Fitzwilliam Hotel to the last evening. We had a perfect evening and a wonderful meal. I have an allergy to garlic and they accommodated my duck meal so that it was just the best. The Thornton restaurant is a must!!!",5,2013,04,29
204,Great location and ambiance,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam on the last night of a trip to Dublin and the west of Ireland, and the location adjacent to St. Stephen's Green is great for shopping and dining.  Our room had a queen bed and overlooked a courtyard.  The rooms are air conditioned and nicely appointed.  Overall, the hotel was clean and stylish, and I'd recommend it highly to someone looking for a boutique hotel in a fantastic Dublin location.",5,2013,04,29
204,B*day present,"It was a birthday of my boyfriend so I choose the restaurant Citron at the Fitzwilliam hotel in Dublin for his dinner. We where a bit late but that wasnt a problem at all, the restaurant wasnt full at the time anyway.
The food was georgeous!!!! I bought a deal on groupon and I need to say it was a bargain, no supplements, great choice and service!!!",5,2013,04,28
204,Very good value at a prime location.,The hotel is very well designed and fitted out and the location is just perfect. The room and amenities are excellent and the breakfast is very good. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The fitness room is tiny but does the trick for a few days. For a good hotel in a European capital city the Fitzwilliam represents seriously good value.,5,2013,04,27
204,all the perks of a 5 star,"This hotel is in a premier location, near shopping, Trinity College, near pubs and music.  Best of all, all the amenities are there - nightly turndown service, newspaper at your door, beautiful bath and room over looking a garden area.  The decor is modern but tastefully done.  The staff is outstanding and the breakfast delicious, all this for a reasonable rate.  Just down the street is another 5 star at nearly 3 times the price!!",5,2013,04,26
204,"Great hotel, terrible restaurant located within","Hotel very nice, rooms clean and well decorated, bathroom really nice with lovely massive bath. Staff within hotel pleasant, courteous and helpful. Awful restaurant onsite (Thorntons) - worst service I have ever received! Totally ruined my weekend.",4,2013,04,26
204,THE place to stay!,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is by far, the best hotel I have stayed at in all my trips to Europe. The staff is amazing - friendly, attentive, and welcoming. The room was absolutely lovely! I loved the decor and seating by the window. The location was KEY! Walk outside and you have Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, and... Gino's for delicious gelato and crepes! There are great restaurants all in walking distance! Tons of Carrolls for all your souvenirs. The hop on - hop off bus tour is right there as well as the train if you want to visit nearby towns. Howth is a short distance on that train and you quickly get to see the countryside & water! Taxis are always available outside. Really, what more can you ask for?",5,2013,04,25
204,Fabulous hotel,"The hotel is right on St. Stevens Green.  It's in an excellent location.  It's a newer hotel.  The staff is welcoming and accommodating.  The value for the room and service you get is right on.  They provide apples on each floor.  Let's face it, we don't get enough fruit while on vacation.",5,2013,04,24
204,Fantastic Fitzwilliam,"We travelled over to Ireland for my wifes's 40th birthday and had the good fortune to stay at this fabulous hotel. We knew that we were going to be treated well from the moment we received a call from Elisa in Reservations. She was lovely and so very helpful. We were treated to free cocktails, and the provison of chocolate birthday cake for my wife on our arrival at the hotel was a lovely touch. The fantastic service continued when we checked in and the manager at reception (Martin?) was so very warm and friendly, and we were extremely impressed when we returned to the hotel some 4 days later that he remembered our names. Unfortunately whilst we cant remember his name, that is no reflection upon him as he helped make our stay so enjoyable. Indeed, we had enjoyed ourselves so much the first time around that we returned to the Fitzwilliam after a few days away in Kinsale and again it was Elisa who made all the arrangements for us. We had a fantastic room with a balcony overlooking St Stephens Green and the hotel was perfectly located for shops, restaurants and bars. The bar staff and catering staff, along with the concierge were all equally helpful, friendly and welcoming. We loved our two nights at the Fitzwilliam and can't wait to return. We wouldnt consider staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2013,04,20
204,"Fiztwilliam Hotel - Perfect 5 Star Hotel, makes you feel at home!","Food, service, room servies are all with no fault. Especial thanks to Concierges and the GM who has looked after us very well during our stay in March and again in April. Reservations  Department must be the most patient & efficient in Dublin, as with our demands and changes, they have always been very accommodating and polite, especially Lisa. We will be back again very soon, and I would highly reccommnd thsi hotel for small and big bookings! If I was to point out one weakness, it would be the Reception Staff who are all polite but would benefit from being more helpful(at the moment the Porters make up for it!)",4,2013,04,16
204,Small rooms...great service,"I have stayed here many times now whilst working in our Dublin office.  This time was for 8 days.  I was spoilt previously and had one of the larger rooms with 4 poster bed looking out on to St Stephens Green therefore my standard room seemed too small.  Well fitted out, comfortable bed and functional if small bathroom.  Service was at all times impeccable from turn down service through to concierge opening the door for you.  Breakfast service vastly improved since my last visit.  Only small criticism in that room service menu very basic and limted choice.  Would recommend highly but try to have your room upgraded if you are in a standard room.",4,2013,04,13
204,Hotel Comfort and Location,"We wanted to find a 5-Star hotel in Dublin at a great price that was in a good location. The Fitzwilliam lived up to the challenge. It's right across from St. Stephen's Green, and just past the southern end of Grafton Street. It's a ten minute walk from Temple Bar. The hotel is modern, but not over the top. It's probably the first 'modern' hotel we've stayed at, and I thought the room was great, though a little small. Although the lobby bar is nice enough, the service was pretty slow and the bar was empty when we visited. Also; if you order a martini (menu price: $11.25), expect to pay $14 for Grey Goose (Surprise!). I didn't care for that. We went to the Westbury Hotel nearby, and their $12.95 martini price from the menu was actually $12.95!That being said, I'd still recommend the hotel. Also the staff was great.",4,2013,04,12
204,Long w/end at the Fitzwilliam,"Very professional and friendly staff especially the porters . Great location as the bars and shops are just a short walk away but 
It's VERY hard to find by car . The dinning area is nothing special neither is the menu . The room we had was ordinary at best . The Hotel once outside of the reception and foyer was in my opinion a three star Hotel .",3,2013,04,11
204,Fantastic trip,"Excellent hotel and fabulous location, the staff were both courteous and friendly, the only reason I have deducted a mark for the room is due to the fact that it was a bit small, but beautifully decorated and comfortable, a fantastic trip! Will definitely be back!",5,2013,04,09
204,"Best Hotel, Best Location!","I stayed at the Fitz during my second trip to Dublin in December 2012.  I'm so glad that I did.  It's a 5-10 minute walk to Temple Bar area.  Of course, for those visiting Dublin for the first time, Temple Bar is one of the main attractions.  However, for anybody that has any experience, Temple Bar is a lot of fun, but getting a good nights rest is a bit of a challenge due to all the outside noise.  The Fitz is an ideal solution.  It is close enough to all the excitement, and you'll still get plenty of rest.  What is more, the hotel is amazing.  The rooms are decent size by European standards.  They are very modern and clean, to include very comfortable beds.  The bathrooms are more than adequate as well.  In fact, I regard the bathrooms at the Fitz as some of the better ones that I have experienced during my many trips to Europe.  Most importantly, there was always sufficient water pressure and plenty of hot water.  While it would not seem unreasonable for a family to stay here, I would have to say that it is more suitable for solo travelers, couples, and business folks.  Additionally, the hotel is situated across the street from St Stephens Green, which is a fantastic city park.  There are plenty of food, shopping, and entertainment options close to the hotel.  Specifically, the Grafton Street Shops are literally around the corner from this property.  As for transportation?  There are many attractions within a 10 minute walk such as Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, Trinity College, and Grafton Street Shops.  The Guinness Factory is a bit further.  Getting to and from the airport is a $20 taxi ride (takes about 30 minutes depending on traffic).  There is a lite rail station across from the hotel, but I never used it.  As for the hotel staff?  They were fantastic.  I arrived a few hours earlier than my scheduled check-in time, but they assisted me with storing my luggage so that I could go out and enjoy Dublin.  Furthermore, they notified me as soon as they had a room ready (almost 2 hours ahead of my check-in time).  Overall, I would definitely feel comfortable recommending this hotel for a visit to Dublin.  Certainly, it will be my first choice for my next stay in Dublin.",5,2013,04,06
204,The right location,"We spent the St Patrick weekend in Dublin. It was fantastic to be in this top class hotel. The hotel is in the right spot. All the places are close. The reception was very friendly. 
The breakfast was very good, but not amazing.",4,2013,04,05
204,Perfect,"Bought a Valentine's day package for an overnight stay here, it couldn't have been a nicer stay, gorgeous rooms and class A service, and a bed I could spend the rest of my life in! The concierge went totally out of their way to help with everything. Can't believe we got it for the price it was. Such a treat!",5,2013,04,02
204,Dublin at its best!,"We just checked out of the hotel this morning and what a marvelous experience.  It is so centrally located.  It is clean, contemporary and the staff are very helpful.  The breakfast is a little dear but you can try to get it included in your rate because it's lovely.  We'll be returning to Dublin and wouldn't stay anywhere else!  Thank you",5,2013,03,29
204,Great,"From the moment we pulled up the concierge took care of everything. The rooms where clean and the bed was amazing. The location is great, at the top of Grafton Street a main shopping area in the heart of Dublin, Thorntons restaurant is a must on the third level of the hotel.",5,2013,03,27
204,4 Star Hotel,"Only a few things made me rate this hotel at 4 and not 5. First, the spa. It's not a spa, it's a tiny room that was probably meant to be a maid storage closet. The massage was mediocre. Second, the in-room dining was HORRID. I ordered the fish and chips, ate it, then spent the rest of the night in bed sick to my stomach. The breakfast at the hotel cafe was ok, it would have been nice to have a few different options each day. Otherwise it was fine. On the positive, the concierge receives a 5 star rating. They were extremely helpful and made the stay stress free! The rooms were clean, the beds were comfortable and staff was great.",4,2013,03,26
204,No Complaints - We enjoyed our stay!,"We stayed St. Patricks weekend so got better value for money compared to other top hotels. Location is perfect, right beside St. Stephens Green just at top of Grafton Street. Reception staff were very efficient and friendly, no queues and he brought us straight to our room and explained everything clearly. As for the rooms the beds were very comfortable, great shower, clean and very quiet on the 5th floor at the back. We enjoyed a few drinks at the bar which were expensive but i guess similar to what you would pay in Dublin city centre. In the morning for breakfast - it was excellent! We couldnt have got better elsewhere for selection of food and quality. Throughout our stay the staff in all parts of the hotel were courtous and friendly which really does make a difference. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2013,03,25
204,Fabulous as always,"This is the third time I've stayed here, and not for a few years now, but everything was as good as I remembered. It feels like a more expensive hotel than it is, and the quality of the service is impeccable. Location is of course also brilliant.

We stayed in an executive room - the most 'basic' - and it was far better than many superior/ deluxe etc. rooms I've stayed in (and paid extra for) at other hotels. Shower and hairdryer both as good if not better than home, heating efficient and flexible, bed extremely comfortable, and a decent amount of lighting  - one of my pet hates of many hotels, which seem to think you want to live in a permanent state of gloom! One small downside, you could hear the music from the nightclub which adjoins the hotel late at night, but only subtly (and only if you were awake anyway - I don't think it would wake you up!) so if this might be a problem for you, ask for a room away from that side.

On the service side, we arrived at 8.50am on a Friday morning and they checked us in straight away, which was brilliant, as it was an awful cold and rainy day and we would have hated to be homeless until 3pm. One of the reception team also lent us their own phone charger when we lost ours temporarily! I also have to mention the excellent bar service. We ended up sitting at the bar late on both evenings being looked after brilliantly by Alex - although, as a result, I may now have a whiskey habit that I didn't have before! 

Lastly, to mention the food - 'hotel bar' food can be very average, but the pasta I had on the last day, just before we went to the airport, was better than just about any I've tasted in far posher restaurants. If you are going to stay in Dublin and are looking for a hotel in this price bracket, don't stay anywhere else!",5,2013,03,25
204,"AMAZING STAFF, BEAUTIFUL HOTEL, BEAUTIFUL EXTRAS.","I stayed here along with my sister, my mom, and my daughter.. upon arrival we were greeted by staff opening the entrance doors, and taking our luggage to our room.. the rooms are stunning, and the staff had left little shamrock, shortbread biscuits laid out for us for st patricks day.. on each floor was a platter of fresh apples every day, and the mini bar was re-stocked with complimentary water.. i honesly could write all day about how amazing this hotel is.. its location is second to none.. its right next door to st stephens green shopping centre, and just a short stroll to temple bar, trinity college, and all the night life. I would highly recommend a visit to the hotels restaurant 'Citron'.. it does a fabulous 3 course, early bird offer, for £25 euros, and you get to sample michelin like meals and service.. its the best food ive ever tasted!! the only negative i have about the hotel is the price of the breakfast.. i would have loved to have sampled it, but at a cost of 25 euros, it was a bit pricey for four of us.. similarly the hotel bar prices were far too high.. they charge over 11 euros for 1 cocktail, and thats the cheapest 1! but honestly i will visit this hotel time again from now on simply for their service.. they are so personal, and make you feel welcome.. it was my daughters 18th, and on her birthday they delivered an enormous bouquet of flowers to our room just as we were waking up.. it was the biggest, most beautiful bouquet ive ever seen.. it is worth paying the extra to stay at this hotel if you can.. its probably the best ive ever stayed in,, and thats saying something because we always stay 5 star!! THANKS TO ALL THE STAFF AT FITZY... :-)",5,2013,03,23
204,What a St Paddy's Day Retreat,"Stayed here for a few days before we watched ""The Best Marching Band in the Land"" march in the parade. Ok, for the few of you who may not be aware, it's the Purdue University Marching Band from West Lafayette, Indiana, USA and my opinion is not necessarily objective. Stylish, contemporary, clean, friendly and, as always in Ireland, extremely accommodating. A special thank you to Alex in the hotel bar who gave me a wonderful tour of Irish whiskey. Red Breast 12 is every bit as good as Middleton at half the price. Close to all the action yet quiet enough when it's time to wind down. This was a fantastic hotel to experience and explore Dublin. I think our rate was around 160 euro or so but that also included the breakfast buffet.. Excellent value!",5,2013,03,19
204,Simply a lovely property,"This hotel is a 'keeper,' and I would definitely return.  The Fitzwilliam is a relatively new hotel located on St. Stephen's Green.  The room was of a good size and modern.  The towels and linens were very nice.  The wifi was excellent.  Breakfast was very good.  The staff was as helpful as it could be.  I especially liked the concierge team and its leader, Patrick.  He was especially helpful while I was planning my wanderings around Dublin.",5,2013,03,12
204,"excellent hotel, would stay there again","very clean, accommodating and friendly. beautiful clean room, very comfortable beds. we arrived early from california, and the manager, mr kelly gave us a complimentary breakfast. unbelievable.  the front staff, especially miro and egla were just wonderful to work with. i have travelled all over europe america and asia, and found this particular hotel to be one of the most accommodating hotel i've ever stayed at. i would definately recommend this hotel to friends and family. also, its in a great location.",5,2013,03,11
204,"Exstraordinary service, especially the front desk staff!!!",We stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel 3 weeks ago for the Justin Bieber concert. The location couldn't have been better. All the shops and restaurants gave us loads to do during the day. The rooms were luxurious with attention paid to detail. From chocolates on arrival to music and dimmable lights in the bathroom. The service was excellent. The front desk staff couldn't have been more friendlier or helpfull. My daughter's only complaint was that she never touched a door handle during our stay. ( staff kept open the doors for us😄),5,2013,03,09
204,"Excellent location, excellent service","Beautiful old hotel in a fantastic area for a tourist (directly across st Stephens green). The service, especially the porters was fantastic.  The bed fairly comfortable.  The breakfast was okay. The room is very clean a decorated well. There is a Dublin green bus stop, for tourist, just across the corner; which is quite convenient. ",4,2013,03,08
204,Great Service and Splendid Location,"The Fitzwilliam is perfectly located on St Stephen's Green, and right at the head of the shopping district. From there, it's only a few steps to Trinity College, and close to a number of fine restaurants. The room was a bit small, but beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean, and very, very comfortable. The service at this hotel was very fine, in fact, both friendly and professional. The Fitzwilliam clearly caters to a business crowd, but was also a terrific spot for we vacationers. ",5,2013,03,03
204,Great Location & Wonderful Bar Area.,"Was in Dublin on business and my normal hotel (The Shelbourne) was booked solid for the days that I was there.   So, decided to try the Fitzwilliam as it's walking distance to where I needed to be.

Arrived VERY early on a Sunday morning, being a realist and having not paid for a Saturday night room, I had no expectations of a room.   

Upon check-in, a room as instantly availale which allowed me to go shower, sleep for a few hours and start my day.  PERFECT!

The rooms are small, but very well appointed.  High speed internet worked well, safe in room, iron, everything you'd expect.    Bed was fresh and comfortable and I slept well, very well.

There are three restaurants on property and a bar.   The bar was my first meal this trip and the service spot-on and food lovely.     

I visited the bar several more times this trip, both on my own and with business associates. Each time the service was top-notch and the collection of bar foods perfect.

One bartender even took me through the various Irish Whiskys, ranging from very inexpensive up to 30-year old aged.     I truly appreciated his knowledge and pointing me in the right direction.

The location was perfect as I was able to walk almost everywhere.

All in all, I would not hesitate to stay at the Fitzwilliam again regardless of it being a business trip or personal vacation.",4,2013,02,27
204,Good service. Bad sleep.,"I frequently travel to Dublin for business and usually stay at Fitzwilliam due to its wonderfully central location. The staff are very helpful, especially the concierge and porters. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are decorated tastefully vibrant and elegant. In the past, I've encountered issues with street noise but this time i was given room 623 which is on the top floor. The elevator doesn't even go to this floor. The wall between the neighbor's room was paper thin and they had young children. At one point I checked to see if the door was ajar because it sounded as if the family was in my room. I could hear every word they spoke including the two children whispering with one another. This was unfortunate for someone like me who was there for business and needed my rest. Not only did they wake up screaming two hours before I was set to get up, one child stayed up all night coughing and another one apparently had nightmares. I got almost no sleep and it was quite frustrating. If location and quiet is what you seek and you are willing to pay a bit more, I might recommend the Shelbourne.",3,2013,02,21
204,Constructive Critisim,"I was very disappointed overall with the Fitzwilliam, it is advertised as a 5 Star and i truly feel that it did not live up to that standard.  The bedroom was small but decorated beautifully the bathroom was I feel 'an accident waiting to happen' with no bath/shower mat on the floor or any mat leading to the bedroom.  The shower head in the bath while it was working where it said hot it was cold and cold it was hot a small thing but nonetheless not of 5 star quality. Finally  what was probably the biggest disappointment was the dining hall for breakfast - what can I say except that I felt I was eating in McDonalds or any fast food takeaway plastic plastic plastic (decor). I also felt that the table of girls from the North who were very private and quite should not have been allowed into the dining room dressed in their pyjamas  surely there should be some code of dress throughout the Hotel. I would like to add that all the staff were very helpfull polite and happy giving a delightful atmosphere to a some what disappointing  stay in the Fitzwilliam.

kind regards

204,Absolute luxury in the heart of Dublin,"Having read the two reviews below, I am completely bemused! From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I was treated like a princess. Having pulled up outside the hotel to get directions to the car park, we were greeted by Patrick (Head Concierge) who kindly took our bags and the keys to the car and arranged to have our vehicle securely parked and bags taken to our room so our check in was totally hassle free.

The Reception staff were very efficient and friendly and even arranged for a vase to be delivered to our room for some fresh flowers we bought, They had even remembered we were staying to celebrate my birthday and greeted me with birthday wishes on arrival, plus a happy birthday plate was waiting for me in our room!

The hotel is perfectly situated for all the sites Dublin has to offer and is sound proofed so you hear none of the city centre noise. The rooms are very contemporary and clean and have everything you need for your stay.

I visited Ursula at the spa who is clearly an expert in her field and gave me loads of really useful tips and information. However, the spa is a very small treatment room rather than what you may imagine from a 'spa' but nevertheless, the treatments I had were faultless.

Upon check out, our bags were held until we returned from Sunday lunch and were then taken and loaded into our car by the fabulous concierge team who again made everything effortless for us. In short, I could quite happily move into this hotel on a permanent basis! I would strongly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel and hope I get the opportunity to stay again in the not too distant future.

Each member of staff looked after us exceptionally well from start to finish and I would like to thank them for making our stay so memorable.",5,2013,02,17
204,"Good, but not 5*!!","Door was practically slammed in my face as I arrived and the front desk were slow and unintelligible at best.  They promised but failed to call when the room was ready since I arrived early, and when they were asked to double check a spa booking time, they clearly didn't.  One local lady on reception later in the stay was the saving grace - polite and knowledgable.  The room was tasteful, although small.  Bed and linens very comfortable and bathroom fairly standard - although the shower was great.  None of the mirrors had decent lighting for putting make up on.  Ursula in the spa ( think single treatment rooms not ""spa"") Is brilliant and the Citron restaurant surpasses any usual hotel dining. Room service was desperately slow.  The ""gym"" is a tiny room with 3 machines - that s it.  Overall it is just not 5*,  more like a nice 3.",3,2013,02,13
204,International sleepover,"Here for the six nations staying with a business group of 20+ middle aged rugby has beens. Amazingly asked to stop singing in the bar which is surely a reflection on Ireland losing rather than usual hospitality in Dublin.  Only complaint is a distinct inability despite numerous requests to actually unlock the mini bar. Therefore a distinct lack of water which is even complimentary, but I guess that can do that if they lock the fridge!  The night duty bar man is a star with perfectly executed Irish coffee at 2.30am for a noisy rabble. ",4,2013,02,12
204,Best hotel in Dublin!,"I've stayed in every top hotel in Dublin, this has to be the best due to service, location and atmosphere. The staff are friendly, professional, and the hotel is beautiful. We stayed in a superb room overlooking St Stephen's green. After leaving the IFTA ceremony, the party gathering was at the Gibson, I can't tell you how happy I was to leave the Gibson and get back to the Fitzwilliam. A luxury hotel with wonderful people running it. Martin ",5,2013,02,12
204,loved it,"This was the first stop on our European honeymoon and we couldn't have been happier. Loved the loft style rooms and little rooftop terraces with gorgeous bathrooms. the staff were extremely pleasant, location was great, would definitely stay here again. PS: driving in Dublin is a NIGHTMARE if you are thinking of hiring a car, lots of one way streets etc.",5,2013,02,08
204,"Brilliant Location, Lovely Staff, Comfy Beds","I stayed here with my friend on a very rare break away from the Kids.  We really loved it. The Location is just brilliant at the top of Grafton Street.  The staff here ( Reception, Night Porter, Concierge ) , were all so friendly and welcoming.  They really made us feel at home.  We had a gorgeous room overlooking St Stephens Green, comfy beds, real luxury ! We treated ourselves to a delicious breakfast in our room the following morning.  We loved everything about the Fitzwilliam - stay here !",5,2013,02,02
204,Great hotel in Dublin city centre!,"We would definitely stay here again.  You cannot beat this hotel for the location and staff friendliness.  The only disappointment was we had no bath only a shower.  The room was a little on the small side but considering you are paying for the city centre it was adequate for our needs.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin.

      ",5,2013,01,30
204,Great Location and hotel,Stayed here with my Husband and nephews and found the location to be perfect and the views of St Stephen’s green very nice. The doorman and concierge were very helpful in getting dining reservations. The bathroom was lovely and we liked the firm beds with very nice linens. Enjoyed a daily stop at the bar for our afternoon cocktail,5,2013,01,29
204,Great hotel,"We stayed here on St Stephens day as well as New Years Eve, and we enjoyed every minute of our stay. Yes some of the room facilities are a little dated now, but the location is fantastic and the hotel staff are friendly and extremely helpful.

We used both the bar and the cafe/resteraunt facilities and the range on offer is great, for anyone staying the Irish breakfast is a must. Our only recommendation for improvement is the upgrading of some of the in room facilities such as the bathrooms and windows, which are a little drafts when we where there, otherwise we can not fault this hotel.",4,2013,01,25
204,Older hotel but good location.,"Just spent 2 week at the Fitzwilliam Hotel - Dublin.  The hotel is central to everything (Grafton & St. Stephens Green) but is showing its age.  The staff are very accommodating and helpful. The hotel bar and restaurant are above average.  My biggest complaint would be that the rooms.  Beds are extremely firm. Air/heat in rooms is loud and funtions inconsistently.  Plumbing (hot water) is old so sporadic temperature spikes in shower makes for occasional surprise. Overall, not the best of hotels I have stayed but the staff tries to help.",3,2013,01,23
204,Nice business hotel,"I have always enjoyed staying here on business. I find the rooms comfortable, I love the bathrooms and supplies - I am less a fan of the food, I think it is missing something but then again I am often disappointed by hotel food (in Ireland particularly). But the staff have been pleasent and over all it is somewhere I am happy to travel back to.",4,2013,01,23
204,Not that impressed,"Good - clean, polite, friendly staff. Excellent location. Not badly priced. Comfy bed. Unlimited supply of free mineral water that could be pilfered from the gymnasium fridge.

Bad - lacked character, rooms could do with some TLC - strange lumps under one of the carpets. Particularly strange was the lack of plug for the bath - I assumed that it had gone missing and enquired with the maid, who told me that indeed no plugs were provided. Undeterred, GG and I intrepidly hunted one down in a nearby hardware shop, and once plugged the bath was very nice. Weird though, and a waste of an hour or so. Gym was very small and poorly equipped (aside from mineral water mentioned above)

An amusing aside was when we enquired about how much a taxi to the zoo, the concierge guessed at 30 euros each way. I can only assume he thought we were talking about a different zoo as the trip was 20 euros in total.

We did not have any food so cannot comment, although the room service menu seemed reasonably priced. Overall, not bad, but felt more like a very good 3* hotel, rather than the 5* we were expecting.",3,2013,01,21
204,"Nice room, excellent location. Don't expect more!","This was a slightly odd experience. It took some time to get attention when I arrived at Reception, but the staff were full of apologies when I was finally attended to. The service level from Reception was good thereafter. I was remembered the following morning (""Did you get the .... you required?"" etc.). I had a sixth floor room, but the lifts only go to floor 5. The resultant trek is quite demanding. The rooms at the back ("" superior"") have not much of a view, but are beautifully quiet. They are large, spotless, exceptionally well-appointed and attractively designed. As a place to sleep, this is an excellent choice. Breakfast is a disappointment, more 2 star than 5 star. It's served in a cramped low ceiling mezzanine that feels and looks as if it's been put in as an afterthought. The tables and chairs are close together and of a sort of 1950's kitchen formica quality. Service is amiable but not slick. I had to ask twice for my fried eggs - and then of course they arrived twice! Computer access and printer are complimentary (always a big tick), but there are only two terminals and one was not working. The printer was out of paper. All of these (and other) minor irritations were quickly put right by staff who were invariably friendly and eager to please, but their frequency is slightly off-putting. 
The location (on St Stephen's Green at the top of Grafton Street) is perfect.",3,2013,01,20
204,Going that bit further to make your stay special,"We've just arrived home from our one night stay in the Fitzwilliam. Let me first say I chose this hotel based on reviews, and so it's no surprise that our stay lived up to its' reputation.
It was our wedding anniversary and on check in, my husband asked was it possible to upgrade, which they did. Our fantastic room looked directly out to Stephen's Green, and the view was spectacular.
After dropping our bags to the room, we went to the bar and were promptly followed by the Gentleman on reception who provided us with free cocktails! What a start! After dining at the AMAZING Citron restaurant ( just go. Even if you don't stay at the hotel just go to the restaurant, you will NOT regret it) we ordered one or two drinks and when we went to pay we were told that the drinks were courtesy of the house! We felt so completely spoilt. With a late breakfast which offered continental and cooked breakfasts - we were set for the day. My only teeny weeny negative is the cost of parking - I thought a bit steep at 10 Euro for one night.
Thank you for making our trip so special!!",5,2013,01,20
204,An absolute delight,"Citron is a must for everyone! We found both the service and food was fantastic here.
Friendly, knowledgable and efficient staff.
Tasty food especially the soup for desert!
I loved the amuse buse!
I would highly recommend it.",4,2013,01,20
204,great night in Dublin,"My wife and i stayed at this property on sat 12 jan,and the only word i could use to describe the hotel room and service is superb.The location is bril and it was so easy to get to all the hot spots on dawson street and grafton street.Our room had a balcony overlooking stephens green and we had a wonderful breakfast overlooking the park with our outdoor heater on.Room service was perfect breakfast was perfect and a special mention to Anthony who looked after us on arrival and also Lorna who looked after us so well on departure and made everything so easy for us.I can honestly suggest if you are looking for real 5 star central Dublin location this is the hotel to use.",5,2013,01,13
204,No fault...flawless five star service.,"Can't say enough good things about our most recent stay at this hotel.
Fabulous all round and especially our supper at Citron restaurant, which was the highlight of our foodie weekend in Dublin.
Can't wait to go back!",5,2013,01,13
204,THE place to stay in Dublin!,"Once again I had the pleasure of staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel while being in Dublin – and this time for an extended long-weekend during the New Year Eve festive. 

In short the hotel is located at the corner of St. Stephens Green and at the end of Grafton Street –hence making ideal for those just wanting to enjoy the city’s excellent shopping facilities, cultural highlights, gourmet options or high-flying nightlife.

The service and friendliness provided by the ENTIRE hotel staff is simply impeccable and should become a standard for any hotels, all over the world.

To put it simple: if you have a chance to go to Dublin – and there are availabilities at this hotel - this is THE place to stay.",5,2013,01,11
204,Luxury in the heart of the city!,"Stayed here recently with my wife, this is our third time here. The staff are very attentive, the place is spotlessly clean, the location is perfect being basically right at the top of grafton street!! The food in the hotel is of a very high standard! I would really recommend this hotel!",5,2013,01,11
204,The best hotel in Dublin,"There are 3 things to look at when considering a hotel
Location, location and er location!
Outside of its fantastic location this hotel is beautiful. The rooms are fantastic in all and every respect. The service is great 
The bar iis friendly and busy and very well run
Breakfast is great
Go you won't be disappointed",5,2013,01,11
204,Lovely hotel great location,Picked this hotel because of its great location at the top of Grafton Street right next to the St Stephen's Green shopping centre. The room was lovely though our view from the window was just of other rooms.  We didnt book the B&B rate because we thought the breakfast was very over priced.  For location you couldnt beat this hotel.,4,2013,01,08
204,Definitely a stay with ups and downs,"Let me start off by saying that my room was beautiful and well kept.  The location is excellent with great access to good restaurants and shopping.  the staff is helpful and caring.  This being said, you could hear the street noise at 4 in the morning.  As it was Christmas time, there were many parties going on and the bar therefore overflowed into the lobby.The shower fell apart while I was in the shower spraying hot water all over the place slightly burning my hand as I tried to shut the water off and arrangements made by the concierge for a Saturday (Euro500) drive into the country side did not go as smoothly as it should as the scheduled driver did not show and the substitue driver spent a significant amount of time unsuccessflly trying to convince us to change our itinerary to a less lengthy one.",3,2013,01,07
204,A curate's egg - good in parts!,"Let's start with the good points.  This is an excellently appointed hotel, beautifully designed, although the lobby is a bit impersonal.  The location simply couldn't be better.  The rooms are extremely pleasant, the beds are divinely comfortable and the bedding is gorgeous.   We slept like babies.  And the staff are charming and very obliging. 

The breakfast, however, is a serious let-down.  The small breakfast mezzanine half-floor seems to only have room for about 50/60 covers - and the hotel has a lot more rooms than that.  When we left the table, we noticed a queue of well over a dozen souls waiting to get a table.  And the breakfast itself left much to be desired.  Although our delightful nice waitress assured us that the hot food was replenished every ten minutes or so, the bacon was like shoe leather and the black & white puddings were dry and hard both days, and all seemed to have been cooked a long long time ago... Even if they'd been cooked moments before, I really don't think that hot food served in troughs like a motorway service station is good enough for a hotel that aspires to quality.  The cold selection was not particularly appetising - on day two, I noted that the smoked salmon was going brown and frilly round the edges.  I had a kipper which arrived with unwanted potatoes, and wasn't very nice.  Really, the quality was very poor indeed on both mornings.  

To be fair, when we quietly pointed this out to the receptionist on check-out, she was genuinely horrified and sorry and took the price of a glass of champagne off our bill - incidentally, a somewhat eye-watering €18 or thereabouts.  

In all honesty, I wouldn't mind if I had to stay there again, but on the other hand, I wouldn't hurry back.  I stayed here once before and found it delightful - but on that occasion I flew out too early to experience the breakfast.",3,2013,01,07
204,Great location Great Food Pity about the hotel,Over priced for box room bed room with stained furniture and carpet. Hotel is dated and badly needs a facelift. Food is its only saving grace. Would stay elsewhere in future and give the Fitzwilliam a 3 star rating. Definitely not a 5 star hotel. ,3,2013,01,06
204,Luxurious!,"Welcoming staff, beautiful room with the most comfortable bed, luxurious carpets.....even in the lift!  Requested early check-in and this wasn't a problem our room was ready and perfect.  Had the most comfortable stay here, unfortunately for one night only, but will definitely be back.  The location is perfect right on st stephens greeen!  Only a short walk to the National Concert Hall, which was our reason for staying.  Would highly recommend the hotel for a city break.",5,2013,01,06
204,perfect,Everything about this place is perfect ! Stayed here on new year for three nights and cannot fault one thing. Special mention to the bar staff the two men at night were great with us very polite and always smiling will be back in the near future without a doubt. also ideal location not to far from the busy temple bar area and right next to the shops .,5,2013,01,04
204,Great rooms and excellent location,"Staying in Fitzwilliam every 2/3 months and strongly recommend it. Quite difficult to find something wrong, probably the lobby which doesn't look great. Rooms, bathrooms, breakfast and service are just perfect. And the location is great in the real downtown Dublin. 
You can get some good rates but be aware that th hotel if often fully-booked.",5,2013,01,03
204,great location!,"we rung in the new year in dublin and got a great deal.  we rang ahead to see if we could check in early and hit the christmas sales, the receptionist was more than helpfull and assured us we could have an early check in. our room overlooked the back of the hotel, the view is nothing to write home about but the room was comfortable but a little small. its located in a great spot, top of grafton street, no taxis needed! staff were very friendly, from reception to the concierge who brought up our bags,he was great for recommendations for dinner and bars. the bed is the most comfortable i've ever slept in! 
breakfast was busy and a little underwhelming, it didnt scream 5 star but did the job. a lot of the staff seemed to be suffering from the previous nights celebrations, we had to ask for things we ordered a few times and when we checked out we could smell the alcohol off the receptionist. we were charged 10euro for car parking which seems expensive compared to other hotels we've stayed in. i would probably stay here again",4,2013,01,02
204,eccellente on every level,"one of the most delightful City hotel I ever experienced - staff very helpful , own restaurant Thornton is one if not the best in Dublin  (you need to book), beds by v-Spring - just loved the whole package!!!",5,2013,01,01
204,4 star,"A nice hotel with good staff but a ways off a 5 star. However we got a good 2 night deal over the New Year so can't grumble too much. Made the mistake though of eating in bar, which was very poor - food and service were decidedly lacking - 35 minute wait for what I had hoped was fish and chips - turned out to be 3 fish ""nuggets"" which would not have fed a 2 year old. Baring that though, a reasonable stay and the on site parking is a gift.",3,2013,01,01
204,Fantastic!,"Stayed here for 2 nights......We had a fab time. Hotel was fantastic and the staff could not have been any better. Perfect location, top class staff, beautiful hotel......also lovely selection of cocktails in the bar. Will defo be back!!",5,2012,12,31
204,Great Dublin Hotel,"We stayed here on a weekend break to celebrate our friend's birthday.  The four of us had a very enjoyable time.  The hotel is in a fantastic location right in the heart of Dublin.  There are many excellent restaurants and bars all within walking distance.  The hotel staff were very friendly - we ate in the restaurant and drank in the bar.  The room was very comfortable, quiet and spotlessly clean.  The hotel was very busy when we stayed and we arrived to breakfast at 'rush hour' but that did not detract from a good hearty breakfast.  Once again the staff were very friendly and efficient.  The decor throughout the hotel is trendy and comfortable. This is an excellent, high end hotel well worth a stay when in Dublin.",5,2012,12,29
204,Can' be beat for location and service,We just returned from two nights at the Fitzwilliam which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The location is outstanding and could not have been more central.  The room was charming and comfortable with all the amenities.  The staff are superb!  Every encounter was gracious and meant to deliver the best possible service.  We had a fantastic stay and will be back!,4,2012,12,29
204,Delightful,Great modern hotel right off Grafton Street and within walking distance of dublin's sights. Great rooms with fast wifi and comfy beds. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful and the hotel restaurant was a real treat. Loved this hotel!,5,2012,12,28
204,"Great location,no complaints","This is a reasonably priced hotel. Helpful staff. Room clean, fully functional,has evert
Ythingyou need, excellent location.  The mini bar had not been restocked and remote controls a little unresponsive and they charged for a newspaper we didnt request but otherwise no complaints. We stayed in one of the 2 suites. Nice bathroom with shower and tub. Toiletries nice. Spotlessly Clean. Wonderful bed and beautiful linen. Very very quiet. They brought a high chair and extra towels quickly and room service was good and prompt. Fairly limited menu but covers main bases. The bar was short staffed at lunchtime (2.30pm) although the sole waiter did an amazing job amd food was nice. Breakfast average, nothing special but we arrived just as the kitchen was closing and it was fine. Valet parking good and only 10euro. The slightly understaffed feel means it is not the best 5 star hotel but it is much cheaper than many 5 star hotels so I would definitely return and have no hesitation in returning. ",4,2012,12,28
204,What a treat!,"My family stayed one night at the Fitzwilliam before Christmas. The hotel is lovely and the rooms very modern and spacious. The location is tremendous, but what makes this hotel better than the rest is the service. My mother was not feeling well the morning we were to leave, and we went out early to check the hours of a nearby pharmacy. The gentleman in the lobby offered to go back to the pharmacy for us when it opened, and offered us late checkout if necessary. Everyone was as kind and gracious as could be. This is a gem of a hotel and I would stay here again and again.",5,2012,12,27
204,No wheelchair access room,Tried to book room in hotel for january. Asked them had they wheelchair access room with accessible bathroom. They emailed back saying they hadn't but they did have big room with standard bathroom .A pathetic answer from a 5 star hotel. I think that maybe illegal so gonna check it out.,1,2012,12,27
204,Modern on the Green,"This was a lovely modern hotel with warm friendly service.  It is very central and a short walk to many major attractions and shopping.  Although it may be a bit more than some other accomodations, the location, quality of the rooms and service make it an easy choice.

The rooms are not large, however, the fantastic bathroom and tub make up for it.  A great opportunity to rest and relax after a full day of walking and exploring.",4,2012,12,21
204,Luxury in the centre of Dublin,"Spent a night in the city recently and took advantage of a gift of a one night stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel Stephens Green. On arrival we were met by a very helpful concierge and front of house staff. The check in was quick and the instructions given in a pleasant manner, as if they were meant. Often than not, I find it becomes a spiel by reception, but in this instance it was clearly meant as if we were her quests. Nice touch.

The room was clean, sheets crisp and in all felt homely and luxurious. The bathroom was spotless and the shower in the bath worked, without a leak or bunged shower head. No faults.

The bar was quiet and apparently was not the norm according to our waitress, but this suited us.

Breakfast was plentiful, with the range of options well presented and managed throughout our time on the mezzanine floor. 

Would I go again? Yes.",5,2012,12,21
204,Excellent Hotel -great location,What a great hotel should be. Impeccable.   Location is perfect in city center near Grafton Street pedestrian walk way.    Staff extremely professional.  Really raises the bar on what good service is.    Only one con:   Most all hotels you stay at after this will seem to be lacking something.,5,2012,12,21
204,Great location,"The location of Fitzwilliam can not be frowned upon - located right in the middle of everything. The bed was also amazing and the pillows were great. Staff were friendly and half of the time the doormen actually opened the doors for us going in and out of the hotel.

We were lucky that we got a great deal via hotels.com, but I would not stay at the hotel at 5-star prices - then I would expect something exceptional. I have stayed in 4-stars hotel with the same level of quality and type of hotel rooms as the Fitzwilliam. 

Also, the carpet in our room ""crackled"" as if there was plastic below - very strange.",4,2012,12,17
204,Best bed I've slept in!,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in the heart of Dublin City on the 11th December, primarily because I had heard of its reputation as being one of Dublin's finest Hotels.
I was not disappointed. I have to make comments about the exceptional reception & lobby staff that greeted us on the evening. My best impressions were of the staff's attention to detail & complete courteousness. And this was true also on checking out when one young staff member asked ""Is there anything else I can do for you today Sir?"". I was about to ask him if he wanted to attend my business meeting in my place at 2pm that afternoon, but that might have been too cheeky! Some points to note about this hotel: The decor is superb, classy & welcoming. The staff are exceptionally attentive. The bathroom in the superior room is MASSIVE. The Four Poster beds are amazing & in fact I have asked management if they can source the providers of the mattresses & pillows at the hotel because I suffer from a bad back & I want to buy these for my own home. And lastly, the views from the balcony we had of St. Stephen's Green (Dublin's Central Park!) were amazing & made our morning when we stepped out. Overall, a great experience I will be back.",5,2012,12,15
204,Great stay in Dublin!,"We booked 2 rooms at the Fitzwilliam for our stay in Oct 2012. (3 nights)
Staff were really friendly at check in and concierge was also helpful with tips for our time in Dublin. 
I was very pleased with the rooms, one of which had a balcony that overlooked the park - it was nice to sit out there and watch the world go by. The rooms were spacious and stylish, bathrooms also very nice and newly decorated. 
Location was fantastic. Right on the to of Grafton St, and opposite the park. We strolled through the park many times, it was lovely. 
Did not eat at the hotel, so cant comment on that. 
Would stay here again and would reccomend to friends.",5,2012,12,15
204,"Great Hotel, Great Location",The Fitzwilliam is in the middle of Dublin across from St Stephens green. I had a queen room with a balcony overlooking the green. I highly recommend the balcony rooms. The staff was helpful and friendly. ,5,2012,12,12
204,Excellent modern hotel and location with Parking,"We staying at the Fitzwilliam hotel in late October, having read numerous reviews.  We were not disappointed.  Interior was very modern, and clean, overall very boutique style.  Our room was on the fifth floor and located not far from the lifts.  Our balcony was overlooking St Stephens green, which was fantastic, this was an upgraded room - which I would definitely recommend.  Had the weather been better we would definitely have used the patio heater and seats relaxed.  Rooms were very well equipped with the usual mini bar, tea / coffee, and luxurious bathroom. Little extra touches were an umbrella and stereo.  
Location is perfect with hotel situated just at the top of Grafton Street, close to shops, restaurants and tram.
When we arrived, concierge parked our car for us and again when leaving, they went and brought it round to the front of the hotel, as it was pouring with rain.  
Buffet breakfast was one of the best I have seen which included the usual sausage, eggs, bacon, but also cheese platter, smoked salmon, pastries and fruit.
Out of all the hotels I have stayed in Dublin this is by far my favourite, because of location and standard of the hotel.
A really enjayable stay, and I will definitely be back - I cannot recommend this highly enough.",5,2012,12,11
204,Ideally located and comfy,"Stayed in this hotel just one night on a business trip. The room was really cosy, with a super comfy bed and very spacious bathroom. The hotel is ideally located near the commercial streets of Dublin and there is plenty of restaurants around the hotel. The rooms with the view on the large park are very nice and not very noisy despite being over the street.",4,2012,12,11
204,"Great Location, Great Value, Great Hotel","We stayed in this hotel last weekend as a romantic break away.  The hotel is located in the best part of Dublin for shopping, sight-seeing and really is the ideal place to be located in the city for a break.  

We got a Winter Getaway deal which included 2 nights B&B and for the hotels standard and location I thought we got very good value.  The hotel is modern with nicely furnished rooms and well kitted out bathrooms with a powerful shower and good sized bath.  

The other stand out point about this hotel besides the location and value were the staff - we were treated very well and everyone we met was extremely professional and welcoming.  

I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on business or pleasure.",5,2012,12,10
204,Great location,"Stayed here with my boyfriend last weekend. We've stayed here on a few occasions and the best thing by far is its location and parking facilities. Once you arrive everything is within walking distance. I only have very minor negatives about our stay the first of which was our room was overlooked by other rooms so for privacy we closed the blinds,no problem there however the lighting is extremely dim. Secondly the hotel seemed lacking in atmosphere,we were the only people at the hotel bar the night we stayed and the next morning we were the only people having breakfast. Finally the gym is pretty small and cramped,I imagine I'd feel uncomfortable if there was more than myself in it.
Overall we enjoyed our stay and most likely would return.",4,2012,12,06
204,Lovely location,"Stayed here on the 25th of nov after having to reschedule original date. Staff were lovely and very friendly, when rescheduling and on the day. Rooms are average size but attention to detail was well above average. Had room service breakfast which was fine and did the job. 1 minute from all the high street stores. Parking was €10 euro for the night which was unimpressive. Lovely view from balcony. Beds were very comfortable. Films were good value too. Pool would have been nice. Enjoyed every second of the stay.",5,2012,12,05
204,Very good but doesn't feel like a five star,"Great stay here, clean, staff were very helpful - the bar was average with average food, not what you'd expect from a five star - infact I found it hard to understand why they are rated five star, when it's just like a four star.  If it was rated as a four star I would give it an excellent rate.

Only issue was if you are staying in room 431 you are either underneath a staff room or a dance floor - lots of movement up there. Also you are right next to an exit that is used by staff a lot, at 2am I was awoken by it slamming at least 3-4 times - so just be aware of that!

Another bug was the plates, glasses, trays left outisde rooms for hours on end, and staff actually passing them by without picking them. Perhaps it has something to do with staff not being allowed to do other departments jobs, but they should at least let housekeeping know. We had a baby with us who nearly fell on top of wine glasses left outside a room.  So just watch your feet when walking down the corridor to your room.",4,2012,12,05
204,this hotel ticks all the boxes,"I stayed here on the night of 28th November 2012. It serves a great pint of Guinness. The food was good the beds were comfortable , it was all very clean and the service was genuinely great. I stayed drinking in the bar until the early hours. The staff were not chasing us off to bed. They were very accommodating.",5,2012,11,30
204,Great Hotel in a Perfect Location,"Our final stop in Ireland was Dublin.  We assessed hotels in the area and found the Fitzwilliam Hotel the perfect one.  Although trying to find this hotel in a car in the evening hours is practically impossible, this hotel is exactly as we expected: a nice find in a perfect location.
The staff was what most impressed us! The concierge, Manor,was amazingly helpful!! As we were trying to find the hotel, he was giving us step-by-step instructions on our mobiles.  He also helped us throughout our 2-night stay with information and travel tips! He is a true asset to this hotel!!
The room was a decent size, very clean, and quite comfortable in spite of the low-lighting.  The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were an added inducement to stay longer. However, the highlight was our incredible view from our balcony of St. Stephens Green, a most charming park!
The Christmas lights had just been put in place throughout the shopping area,  and the views were gorgeous!
This is definitely a business hotel; however, our reception from the staff at the desk all the way to the breakfast/dining room were both professional and warm, something you don't see too often in business-oriented hotels.
Another bit we don't usually see: the Food and Beverage manager, Mr. Kevin Carroll, greeted the guests personally, and even sat with us briefly to visit! What a pleasure that was!! He is an absolutely delightful chap who made us feel like family!! Can we say, ""someone needs a raise""?
The location is centrally located allowing us to,park the car for 2 nights in the hotel garage (which was a Godsend, as well as a pleasant surprise to be charged a pittance).  Everything is walking distance to all of the attractions.
Truly a nice find!",4,2012,11,29
204,"Great location, but my executive room was miniscule","I stayed here in early November. As others have observed, this hotel is wonderfully situated, just opposite St. Stephen's Green and adjacent to Grafton Street, the numero uno shopping street in Dublin. The staff are exceptionally pleasant people, right down to the good humoured chambermaid who pressed a couple of mouth-watering chocolates into my hand (despite the fact that I had declined to avail of the nightly turndown service).

However, the room (which overlooked an office building) was very small, the most miniscule I have ever experienced in a Dublin five star hotel. In fairness, however, I should add that - small and all as it was - it was very comfortable with an excellent bathroom complete with powerful shower  (which really wakes you up in the morning) and top-of-the-range bath products. 

There are many reasons why this hotel is classified as ""five star"", including the presence of a Michelin-starred restaurant in the building. However, I do not think it is is in the same league as some of the other Dublin five star hotels such as the Merrion, Shelbourne and Four Seasons respectively. Putting it bluntly, it is a mistake to label a room as ""Executive"" if it is very small in terms of its size.",3,2012,11,28
204,Underwhelming,"Having booked this 5 star hotel - I felt a bit disappointed, although the room decor was bright and modern the room was small.
I know it sounds trivial but on making a cup of coffee in the room - there wasn't a biscuit or sweet to take along with it.
We went to citric on the mezzanine level for breakfast the next morning - well fistly it is too small to accommodate any kind of breakfast rush we had to wait 5 mins for a table to be cleared and re-set - I got the distinct feeling that no one knew what they were doing when we got to our table there was no salt and pepper or butter we ordered tea and toast on sitting - the tea came 5 mins later no toast - this arrived 10 to 15mins later we were told it was a buffett breakfast - so basically serve yourself and then on going to the hot food section all the clloshes were empty and had to be restocked and this was done in an add-hock manner. Imagine my surprise when 2 tables over the diners received eggs benadict delivered to their table to be told that then that yes there was a menu available for such items but where it was is anyones guess.Needless to say I wont return",3,2012,11,28
204,Highly recommended,"Terrific central location with easy access to shops and many restaurants.     Staff extremely friendly and helpful, even down to the chambermaids..    Good sized bedrooms, well presented and large comfortable beds.     Excellent breakfast, cooked just the way we wanted.",5,2012,11,27
204,"Great location, grand hotel","Was delighted with how close the hotel is to great restaurants and shopping. Unfortunately, do not remember too much about the rooms since I got back late and had a very early morning flight out of Dublin.",4,2012,11,26
204,What a great location!,"Have stayed here several times. Good location. Helpful staff. Considerable variation in room type and size. That's why I've marked rooms as average even though one I had would easily rate 'fabulous'
Food has always been good, particularly the breakfast. The gym's not very large. Lots of great restaurants nearby.",5,2012,11,24
204,Good hotel but ...,"I'm used to stay often in this hotel. The location in the center of Dublin is perfect. Usually the rooms are great but I had a bad experience last time with a room on the 6th floor (last one) : noises coming from the roof the whole night (i.e. elevator engine etc ...)
The breakfast is just average, given the price: last time, there was no orange juice left, and the eggs and bacon were average.",3,2012,11,24
204,Not terribly impressive,"Great staff, nice public areas, but ridiculously small rooms with barely room to manouevre. And that was with an upgrade! The room was cramped and for the price paid I would have expected more space. Great location though.",3,2012,11,23
204,Missing belongings,"I've stayed before and enjoyed it, this time was tarnished by leaving an expensive item behind and then surprising housekeeping not being able to locate it.  Very sad indeed when you can stay at a lower class hotel and have personal items returned to you.",4,2012,11,19
204,Great Weekend Break,"Stayed here for the weekend with my husband and we had a great time. The hotel is ideally located on St Stephen's Green just by Grafton Street so you are within easy walking distance of all Dublin attractions. The Hotel itself is very nice, we stayed on the 5th floor where the rooms have balconies overlooking St Stephen's Green. The room was pleasant enough but surprisingly small and was slightly dominated by the 4 poster bed, if it were not for the magnificent view I would probably have been slightly dissappointed. We had cocktails in the bar which had a lively atmosphere and also ate lunch here which was very tasty. Breakfast was of a high standard with eggs cooked to order and everything else you would expect in a buffet.",4,2012,11,19
204,"Great staff, great location!","Stayed for 2 nights and the overall experience was great - room was ready when we arrived at noon which was perfect. Very professional staff and amazing service. Only two small things were not perfect; Towels & bathrobes were not as fluffy as expected from a 5 star hotel and curtains did not close completely. Apart from that, great value for money",4,2012,11,18
204,Good business hotel in perfect location,"Stayed two nights while on a business trip. Really liked this hotel. The location is perfect. The rooms are spacious and you are not disturbed by other guests. The staff are friendly. Only drwback is the breakfast room which feels a bit small and the service is so so. But in general, I would be happy to stay here again!",4,2012,11,17
204,Quality.,"2 night stay in this class hotel. Quality abounds, from the superb bar to the luxurious rooms. Staff are very well trained, polite and couteous. Food in the bar was top class. Great selection of beer.  Location is ideal, right beside St Stephens Green and Graton St. Bruxelles, with it's Phil Lynott statue, is a 2 minute walk and at the weekend they were still serving at 3am Sun morning. Steaming!!!! Highly recommend his hotel.",5,2012,11,17
204,"excellent, makes you feel welcome","You're made to feel welcome. The rooms are great, it does feel like a boutique hotel. Free wifi. Onpy little minus is breakfast, I ve realised I quite like buffets. Here, breakfast isn't included, and even though you can order everything you want, you have to order the warm stuff, so by the time it turns up you're not that hungry anymore, so I only did it the first day, but maybe it just me that it bothers. Not sure the reception and breakfast staff are trained properly. If you need something changed on your booking i the evening, make sure to double check with the morning staff. Everyone is friendly though amd ready to help, so that's all good.
We had a view over a garden so very quiet.
Hotel very well located.",5,2012,11,15
204,Expected a little more for the price,"We arrived to this hotel as the last leg of our honeymoon.  The location of the hotel is great. I asked for a room overlooking St Stephen's Green as another reviewer recommended but was shot down being told the hotel was packed. Unfortunately that meant my room view was some weird patio area in between the hotel & another building. I closed my blinds right away because it wasn't nice to look at and made me uncomfortable. Also the room was so far from the lift - I know someone has to be the last room in the hall - we weren't even the last. We called concierge to book a restaurant reservation but they were unable to assist stating the restaurant we wanted was booked. Then the breakfast which was included in our booking - the restaurant in the hotel didn't open till 8 am & we needed to leave the hotel by 7:30 am. We got room service as an alternate & had to pick the 7-7:30 am time slot otherwise we could not get a warm breakfast. The room service was delivered wrong and late. The room itself was nice, the shower was great. For the price, there are other hotels I would go back to first.",3,2012,11,13
204,Big let down,"Stayed for a surprise weekend (fri-sun). The gym has only 3 machines in total (2 of which were out of order!) - for a 5 star I found this appalling! The restaurant was equally disappointing with the food served up cold! When I returned my plate, it came back colder still. While the staff were very apologetic, nonetheless this is not good enough for a 5 star. The water from the t-pot at breakfast was dirty (I pointed this out to the staff and they cleaned the pot but the damage was done at this stage). Also, the entrance door of the hotel was left opened for about 20mins during our breakfast on the first morning, as the mezzanine restaurant is located just above the main reception, it meant we were frozen cold for the duration of breakfast! All in all a weekend to forget - more like fawlty towers than a 5 star hotel at the heart of stephens green Dublin I'm afraid!",1,2012,11,12
204,Dublin,"Nice hotel, great location. Modern and helpful staff. Gym machine were all broke on day or trip unfortunately which isn't really on for a 5 star hotel (the machine have been showing wear and tear for some time). Stay there each month due to location- across from the LUAS station and st. Stephens Green park. €22 for breakfast is a little steep....",4,2012,11,09
204,My favourite hotel in Dublin,"This was my 6th stay and I really like this hotel. I've stayed in all the 4&5 star places in Dublin on business over the past few years and this is the nicest in my opinion. The staff are very welcoming and efficient and the rooms are all you'd hope for at this level. I personally prefer to overlook St Stephens Green in a third floor room, yes it can be a little noisy sometimes but this is Dublin, so......! Breakfast is excellent and there are enough bigger tables for a relaxed business breakfast meeting. The location is superb with access to shops and great restaurants in walking distance. As I'm usually take out to dinner I've never eaten in Thortons but have heard good things.....maybe next time. Highly recommended.",5,2012,11,08
204,Great location but no way a 5 star hotel,"We picked this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor and the fact that it was a 5 star hotel. This hotel is in no way a 5 star hotel but would definitely be a 4 star. 
Rooms were oddly decorated but comfortable. Bathroom towels are horrible. They're very thin and not the quality I'd expect from a hotel of this standard. 
Staff were friendly and polite and smiled which was nice. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that. 
Location is excellent. 
Overall a good hotel, but with minor issues. ",3,2012,11,07
204,THE lodging in Dublin!,"We spent 3 nights at the beginning of our 2 plus week Ireland trek. The location is unbeatable - you can walk most anywhere within 10 minutes. Public transport at the front door.

Superb and friendly staff. 

A very nice and modern hotel. Decent sized rooms.

Breakfast was included and quite good.

At the end of our trip we stayed for 3 nights at the Four Seasons. Although that was superb - the Fitzwilliam's location was so good we would opt for the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2012,11,04
204,Gorgeous room great service!!,Had the best stay here..... Beautiful hotel great location amazing service!!! The reception team were so helpful and friendly they made us feel right at home!! They're a great credit to the hotel!! We were on a weekend away and they made it extra special for us by giving us an upgrade to an exec room with a view over Stephens green! Best service we've ever received! Definitely recommend it to everyone n we can't wait to come back whenever we stay in dublin again!,5,2012,11,04
204,Another excellent stay,"I wouldn't usually post a review of somewhere I've already reviewed as excellent, but this stay was longer (4 nights) and even better.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful, the room was great - I love that the two rooms we have stayed in had entry ways with a coat hook and a place to store luggage.  The bathroom is luxurious with a great bath.  Location can't be beat.  Looking forward to visiting again!",5,2012,11,04
204,Good position handy to mall,"Rooms were quite small and needed refurbishment.  Rooms at the front can be noisy due to late  night revellers on the street outside.  Bath leaked like a sieve, complained but nothing done. Breakfast adequate.",3,2012,10,31
204,Great hotel for a couple,"Excellent location a short walk from Grafton St. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay although it was only 1 night. All the usual amenities: water, robes, slippers, very comfy bed and deep looooonngg bathtub for a soak. This hotel is across the street from St Stephen's Green and a short walk to Grafton St. Its quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar, but still walkable if you want a late night out. There is a nightclub next door and we saw many people waiting outside but once we were in our room we could not hear anything!",4,2012,10,30
204,Rooms could use refurbished,"This is a nice hotel, but for the price we paid the room seemed a little worn in some places.  The decor overall is very nice, the bathrooms were huge, the chocolates at nice were a great touch, we loved the fireplace in the lobby coming in from the rain and the location can't be beat!",4,2012,10,30
204,St Stephens Green Location,"The foyer needs a warmer more welcoming touch,but
We had a lovely room and a delicious breakfast. The treatment room was small and we were very lucky to discover it was there at all as the facial and massages we got were superb.
They alone would take us back.
The staff on the the reception desk were most helpful.
We will return",4,2012,10,28
204,Very good location and nice hotel,"Stayed in the hotel for 4 nights when attending a conference i Dublin.

Walking distance to the conference and in the middle of the town. The St. Stephens Green park is just opposit the hotel, the Grafton street (shopping) starts outside the hotel and the Temple Bar area is also only a short walk from the hotel.

Good service from the staff during my stay. Did have one issue with the cleaning of the room but that was solved very quickly with a complimentary voucher for two coctails in the bar.

Stayed in a standard room, nice and clean but quite small. Was also a corner room (213) where one corner of the room was ""missing"". The bed was also a little short, my foot was normally outside the bed (I'm 183 cm long).

The only complaint I have is that it on some days there was a smell in the common areas which where quite bad. To us it smelled like sewer. 

Would definitely stay again when in Dublin.",4,2012,10,27
204,Nice Stay!,"My husband and 11 year old daughter had never been to Ireland and this was a perfect 'home-base' for us.  As the other reviews stated it is in a great location with lots of things to do.  On the weekends it gets very busy and crazy but nothing to be worried about.  It was close the the train, sight seeing tours, places to eat and St. Stephens square is a must!  Stop and feed the swans and ducks.  Its a blast!

Pro's
Great location
All around good service
Free Irish Breakfast - eggs, potatoes and other stuff to order.  Nothing fancy but good.
Eton Mess in the bar was amazing!
Rooms were nice...small but nice.

Con's
Room were small for 3 people...queen size and roll away bed.

We will return if we visit Dublin again.",4,2012,10,25
204,dont need an early morning call,"stayed in the fitzwilliam hotel for 2 nights .nice hotel great location . very expensive for what you get .room was very hot and stuffie couldnt sleep as it was to warm and if you opened the window the noise from out side went on until approx 4.30am and i just was getting into a sleep when the luas outside started up with a bell ringing every few minutes what a nitemear .i am sure there r better hotels in the same area with less noise and a lot cheaper .would never stay in this hotelagain also the room was very small and there seem to be a lot of heat coming out of the bathroom ,i was lucky i was in the room on my own orther wise it would be very cramped not value for money and i would not recommend this hotel .",2,2012,10,25
204,Nice stay,"My husband and I traveled to Dublin in October 2012.  We found this hotel to be very nice and in a great location with plenty of things in walking distance.  Grafton street is right around the corner and St. Stephen's Green is across the street.  Our room was also very nice.  Very clean and just the right amount of space for the two of us.  The only downside is that there are a few homeless people camped out a few yards away from the hotel entrance.  Not a huge deal since it is a large city, but definitely felt a little unsafe at night as one lady followed us to the hotel and tried to pick a fight with my husband.  A little unsettling, but it definitely did not ruin the trip.",4,2012,10,24
204,Not sure if i would go back,"Decided to get away and went to republic match in dublin.  Away with no kids so decided to stay here, expensive for a rpom you could not swing a cat in ecpecting more and breakfast was not great and seating not comfortable.  We expected more for our money !!",4,2012,10,23
204,"Nice, but not the Westbury","I booked this hotel at last minute, as I could not get into the Westbury.
I would rate this hotel as good, average is a little unfair hence the very good status.
The room was nice, although the carpet was worn out in the bedroom, but pretty good for 220 euro per night at last minute. 
The highlight would be the breakfast menu - fantastic.  They had amazing service and the food was perfect, as was the coffee.  The business centre saved me, as I had to last minute change flights etc, and print out flight itinerary  etc - all done at no cost without the assistance of someone - I think these little things make a difference in 5 star hotels. 
The check in was a little so, so - but all other aspects were good.  I found this room quite noisy - but that seems to be something that is more common in the older buildings.  This was a pretty basic room as it was only me staying.
The location is also excellent, different part of town - probably I would describe as more eclectic - where the Wetsbury is more luxurious.
I stayed here two nights, and then went back to the Westbury for another two nights before leaving for New Zealand - which was more 50 euro more expensive per night but I think worth it.",4,2012,10,22
204,Terrific Hotel!  Central and Convenient!,The Fitzwilliam is an excellent hotel!  For us it was especially convenient being across from St. Stephen's Green and just off Grafton.  Getting around Dublin from the Fitzwilliam was so easy!  The hotel has a very modern decor with well appointed rooms.  They have made great use of the space in the rooms with their clean simple decor.  The staff was always helpful and accommodating.  The conceirge was also helpful in getting reservations for us.  We needed to change rooms as ours smelled like someone had been smoking in it.  The staff quickly responded and had us in the room next door within a few minutes.  Breakfasts each morning were excellent.,5,2012,10,22
204,"Lovely hotel, good value","Right in St Stephens Green, this as a great location for a hotel for the weekend. The rooms were decent with all the amenities you would expect. Breakfast in the restaurant offered a good variety of hot and cold foods, with eggs cooked freshly to order. The only niggle would be weak coffee. Overall the staff were friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the stay and would return to the hotel again.",5,2012,10,22
204,Very disappointing,"We visited this hotel for our anniversary trip to Dublin and got an upgraded room/suite. I was disappointed everyday. The room was a great size, and the location was great. However, the minibar did not work the entire time we were there even though there was supposed to be complimentary water. The second day we were there the hot water was not working. I called the front desk and they said they would investigate and call me back, meanwhile I am waiting in a towel for a call back. 45 minutes later I call them and they don't even apologize for not calling back, just say that a part went out, nothing they could control and it would be working soon. Good thing we didn't wait because it did not come back on until 2 in the afternoon! The gym is a joke, a tiny room with maybe 3 machines and a weight set. The treadmill didn't work the entire time we were there, just said out of service. 
The breakfast was pretty good, the food seemed fresh, although we stayed away from the heated food and stuck to pastures and yogurt. We ate dinner at Citron one night and I was impressed, probably the best part of our stay. We were also there when One Direction was staying there and the staff pretty much ignores you. We waited almost an hour to get ice delivered to our room. Overall, would not recommend staying in this hotel and we will definitely not be back.",2,2012,10,21
204,A great hotel in central Dublin,"Perfectly located just across from St Stephens Green and at the top of Grafton Steet.  Excellent staff, always knowledgeable and helpful.  Rooms are clean and well decorated, perhaps a little small, bathroom is good, aircon is quiet and efficient.  A nice touch was the multimedia player and the free wireless internet.  Breakfast was buffet style and quite adequate, again the staff were very attentive.  The concierge let us leave our bags there for the whole day when we left, no problem at all.  This is the third time that we’re stayed there, and we would definitely stay again.",5,2012,10,21
204,Impressed,"I recently travelled Ireland and stayed at 5 Star hotels. Here are my thoughts about the Fitzwilliam. 

The Excellent: The bedding and pillows are amazing. The decor is very modern and love the harwood floors in the entrance of the room. Very clean. Very large bathtub, to the point I was complaning to my partner it was too big! haha. Great location to Temple Bar, Grafton St, and Trinity College. Right on St Stephen's green. Accomodated us when we arrived early in Dublin from a long flight. 

The Good: The breakfast was a buffet style, it was just ok. The staff were mostly great and accomodating but not many of them are ""Irish"". The food at the Citron Restaurnt was good and affortable but the atmosphere in the restaurant lacks some character. WIFI was worked well. 

The needs improvement: The lobby is a bit bizarre......when you first enter it is hard to see the reception desk. There is a nightclub next door, which is great for people watching but if you have a room on the street side, I could see how it would be loud. Scratchy toilet paper-I'm all for being enviromentally friendly but this TP was really scratchy. 

Overall-really solid hotel in the city. A few extra detail would make it excellent.",4,2012,10,20
204,Made my trip to Dublin extra-memorable,"Loved this hotel.  Stayed on business for one night only, but I'll be very tempted to return and pay to stay with my girlfriend and/or friends (certainly if we can get a similar rate to the corporate rate, which I thought was very reasonable).

The location is perfect - right on St. Stephen's Green.  Pleasant lobby, great breakfast (full Irish, mmmmmm), but what really made this one of the best hotel's I've stayed in recently was the room - wow: lovely large four poster (larger than double, possibly a queen); window seat; chocolate dipped strawberries on arrival; fantastic decor - bliss

Would have been 5 stars for cleanliness too except that the bath filled with water quite quickly when the shower was running.  The lovely, powerful shower won't have helped this, but I suspected it was possibly also due to the drains needing a little routine unblocking",5,2012,10,20
204,"Great rooms, great service and great location","My second time in Dublin, so I decided to try to the Fitzwilliam Hotel, mainly because of it's location.

Since the checkin experience I knew I had made a good choice. The staff is great, very well trained and willing to help you with whatever you need.
The rooms are in a decent size (a little bit small to tell you the truth), but very well maintained and with a beautifull decor. Very clean bathroom with nice amenities. 

Convenient located across the street from the St Stephens Green park. If is not raining, you don't need to get a car or a cab to anything!
There is a TGI Fridays literally next door, and a few fast food chains that stay opened untill late hours nearby.
The breakfast is a little overpriced, but is good (not great).",5,2012,10,19
204,They thought of everything,"What an amazing place to stay. Great service provided by all of the staff. Rooms were lovely and fully equipt as you would expect with great extras- umbrellas, candles (with matches) complimentary water, tea, coffee, newspapers, turndown service. Amazing shower!. The best nights sleep in ages too. Breakfast was great with hot food cooked to order (hot buffet at the weekend) any coffee you like, plenty of fruit, pastries, cheese, meats etc. I would return here like a shot!",5,2012,10,17
204,"fantastic hotel, keep up the great service!","I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one week in April while producing a segment on Ireland for a US cable network and loved my stay at this fabulous hotel. The rooms are beautiful, the location right on St. Stephen's Green could not be more central, the service is friendly and responsive, and the food - oh my, the best! The breakfast buffet each morning was glorious with terrific variety and very fresh. Even though we were in walking distance of many great city centre restaurants, it was tough to leave the Inn on the Green and Citron restaurant in the hotel itself. Inn on the Green has the best chips/fries in town! Our meal at Citron was a complete delight on the taste buds and the eyes. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The only downside really is its much deserved 5-star status and the cost that brings with it. I doubt I could afford a week-long stay myself, but I would treat myself to a weekend stay here  in the future.",5,2012,10,16
204,Excellent location and services,"We stayed for 6 nights. This hotel's location is fantastic, convenient to shopping and shopping. The vuew of St Strphen's Green ans light rail made us feel close to the locaks. 
The staff members were eager to please and the room was clean and comfortable.
Highly recommended.",5,2012,10,15
204,Perfect,"When we arrived before 7:00 am our room that we had booked as early arrival was not ready yet, however they upgraded our room so we could check in immediately.  Concierge went beyond expectations, we never touched our luggage and cabs were ready when we needed them.  Breakfast all three mornings was wonderful with a pot of coffee promptly at your table.
Rooms were spotless and decorated nicely, and quiet in the evenings.  Also great location directly across from Stephens Green and around the corner from Grafton Street.   Would absolutely return to the Fitzwilliam.",5,2012,10,13
204,"Great location, disappointing","Our first stop. Don't believe you have early checkin as they inform you they do not do it, even when confirmed on booking. 
Room was adequate but seems to have been DIY standard, not what westerners are used to. Looks good on the brochure but look a little closer to the detail. Mini bar did not work at all, mentioned to reception who would take care of it, not. Still not working after 4 days- although custom seems to be give a person a glass of ice and a hot soft drink everywhere.beer was always cold though.
Fantastic location with the Green across the street, doorman was very helpful. Food was less than desired in the breakfast room, poor quality with hard boiled received for poached eggs. Bar had little atmosphere and inconsistency with drink making. Food served here was average. Menu on the Michelin star restaurant in house was very limited unless one eats seafood ( husband cannot eat seafood) so gave it a miss.",4,2012,10,09
204,A taste of Luxury in the midst of Dubli,"We managed to get a good deal through laterooms so spent out last night here - and we were really pleased. The concierge was really helpful, the location was excellent and the rooms were lovely - very comfortable beds, great bathroom (huge bath/ rainwater shower/ decent toiletries and at last, somewhere with a decent powerful hairdryer!) Our room was plush and restful (lighting was a bit too muted for reading!) and very quiet. Breakfast was great, lots of choice, freshly cooked. 
Would definitely recommend.",5,2012,10,08
204,Terrific hotel,"My second time here and a beautiful hotel in a central spot near Grafton St. The rooms are impeccable, service second to none with free internet and valet parking. We didn't eat there so can't comment on that but otherwise I would say the place is perfect. The rooms are well appointed, clean and quiet.",5,2012,10,04
204,Very nice,"The room was quite comfortable with modern decor, but not overly severe.  The rest of the hotel was quite nice and the breakfast was very good.  The reason I did not rate it was excellent was the service that I received in the restaurant for dinner was very, very slow.  Although seated quickly, it was approximately 20 minutes before anyone came to check on us with a menu or water.  The rest of the dinner was equally slow.  On the flip side, the breakfast service was impeccable.  The concierge service was very good.  Location was great and close to everything.",4,2012,10,01
204,Needs to improve for 5 Star,"If you put 5 stars out front you are saying you can deliver the perfect hotel stay, the Fitzwilliam has work to do to deliver on that. 
The rooms are very good, high quality decor and finish, the bed and shower are fantastic.
The halls are very well decorated and with high quality carpet and wonderful lighting.
The ground floor does not say 5 star to me, neither does the bar, they both feel bland and not all that welcoming. The Guinness was appalling.
Breakfast was ok, I would expect cook to order for a 5 star hotel and it wasn't bar the speciality eggs.  The buffet was ranging and hot but definitely not the same as cook to order.
On check out the bill was incorrect but was fixed quickly.
I had rang down to have our car waiting outside but the concierge was not given the message so no car and I was told it would take a while. We got it ourselves as we were in a hurry.

So altogether an ok stay, need to raise its game for 5 stars and that sense or urgency you get from professional 5 star staff was not apparent in the Fitzwilliam.",3,2012,10,01
204,Excellent hotel,"The room was extremely comfortable, location was excellent for Trinity University.  The staff were very friendly and even escorted me up and down the stairs due to my fear of lifts. The hotel was expensive for one night.",5,2012,09,30
204,"Not cheap, but an excellent base","We are a mature couple, and stayed here for a few days in September. The location is terrific, especially as we went to Leopardstown races, straight down the light railway, and right in the city centre. The service is very good, especially the concierge. It looks very modern inside, not always to my taste, and while the room was not very big, it was very well appointed..",4,2012,09,30
204,Great Place to Stay,"We finished up our Ireland tour at the Fitzwilliam and I have nothing but great things to say about it.  While our room was smaller than our friends, it was luxurious and comfortable and very quiet.  The breakfast was excellent.  We had a complimentary dinner at Citron, their less expensive restaurant and the meal was fantastic, the best we had on the trip.  Add to that a friendly helpful staff and location a short walk from all the action in central Dublin and you have a great place to stay.  The hotel is modern and the lobby small; it's not a classic hotel with old paintings and big chandeliers, so if you want that type of environment, you will have to look elsewhere.",4,2012,09,29
204,The perfect Finish ofr Our Last Days in Dublin,"We came back to Dublin from an exhausting tour of the country staying in castles and manors.  Some of them were great and some of them were let's say OK.  But the one that stood out was during our last 3 days in Dublin.  We took those days to see Dublin  closely.  The Fitzwilliam was the best part of it.  The rooms were big and comfortable with all the amenities.  The beds were wonderful after our long bus trips.  The room was cared for and looked like I would like my home bedroom to look.  It was quiet.  But the best feature of the hotel was the concierge services which I will describe.  We wen on a trip to Belfast.  It was raining very hard and we were seeing the sights and also where the last line was of the ""Troubles""  There were 10 of us. We went to a large sprawling what I would call a mall  in which you have to go through  a vast department store to get to the restaurants.  We enjoyed our lunch and as we split up there were 6 of us eating together.  When I started to walk to our bus to return to Dublin my raincoat had disappeared. We went back to the restaurant, we went back to the Apple store we had visited, our guide called the Taxi company that took us to the ""Trouble"" zone and there was no rain coat.  The day before we left I went to the Concierge and one of the young guys called Belfast and he checked all over. Then he suggested that we call the department store.  Well there it was!!! However the woman in that store would not send it to the US.  The concierge negotiated with her and devised a circutitus way in that he would send her a prpaid envelope to send it to the Fitzwilliams and then he would sen it to us!  It arrived yesterday.  I wasn't surprised because of industriunous of the concierge and his inventiveness.  an A+ for the Fitzwilliams!!!",5,2012,09,29
204,Great location But,"Booked two rooms months ago through trivagoo , was surprised to hear we where getting upgraded , usually when you don't book direct you get worst room , both rooms where excellent over looking st Stephens green , everything going great until we where going to sleep about 10pm when music started below us which carried on until early hours ,also bedroom doors don't have soft closing so when doors close they bang which also kept us awake , breakfast was excellent so was free wi fi , so you don't want to be staying front of hotel weekends ",3,2012,09,24
204,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"I only stayed a night, the room was very small, but it was luxurious. The location is fantastic as you are in the heart of the city, but with a beautiful park across the street. The wifi was excellent and the bar served great food (Irish and non Irish fare).",4,2012,09,22
204,Wonderful stay,"While we only stayed at this hotel for one night, we were quite enthralled with its character, the rooms, the staff, the location, and the breakfast.  All the great attributes of a fabulous hotel.  Our visit to Dublin was a tad disjointed.  We had booked the Westbury Hotel for one night, but decided to arrive in Dublin one night early.  The town was fairly booked, but we were able to get a room at the Fitzwilliam.  The next day, they were kind enough to load our luggage in our car and move the car to our new hotel a few streets away while we took the opportunity to stroll around Dublin.  Not to mentionl, we really had no desire to navigate the streets of Dublin :)  Very much an above and beyond move that warrants extra pats on the back.",5,2012,09,21
204,Service Par Excellence,"From the first moment we entered the hotel until we checked out, the service at the Fitzwilliam was absolutely fantastic.  I can't say enough about the professionalism and service we received from Viktoria, at hotel reception, to Tony and Stefan, at concierge.  Bravo Bravo!  We felt like royalty and enjoyed every moment of our stay.  All the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating.  The room was beautiful, the breakfast was very good, and the location near St. Stephens Park and Grafton Street is extremely convenient.  I'd stay here again in a minute.",5,2012,09,19
204,Delightful Dublin!,"This magnificent hotel is right in the centre of the city, making it a great place to stay for business or liesure trips. It really does have a wow factor.
All of the cities main attractions are close by. 
The staff are warm, friendly and very helpful, I travel to Ireland frequently on business, and if I am in the east of the country I always try to stay at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2012,09,18
204,Perfect location,We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in August of 2012.  This hotel has the perfect location at the top of Grafton Street and across from St Stephens Green.  We were able to walk everywhere from this main point.  The hotel staff was very nice and helpful with giving us ideas and instructions on getting around the city.  Our room was wonderful.  We would definately stay here again.,5,2012,09,11
204,Comfortable stay!,"Good breakfast, nice rooms and good service!
The location of the hotel is just off the main shopping street in Dublin and close to Temple Bar! 
Only issue i had was the window in my room didn't close properly. 
Other than that I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again !",4,2012,09,09
204,Well located design hotel,"I was here for business and stayed unfortunately here for only 1 night. But what a beautiful designed hotel and so well located for shops, restaurants, bars & the park. I will pick this hotel when I will visit Dublin for leisure.",5,2012,09,07
204,Great accomadation,"Myself and 3 friends enjoyed our stay in Fitzwilliam Hotel, very high standard, convienent to shops and pubs!! Excellent staff. would def recommend to anyone visiting Dublin. Service was excellent and rooms very tastefully decorated.",5,2012,09,03
204,Dublin's finest hotel inmy opinion,"I stayed here for my anniversary last month and found it to be amazing. The staff are simply excellent and a credit to the hotel. The rooms are spacious and impeccably tidy as is the hotel throughout. They have a wonderful bar with the most delicious and innovative cocktails I have had in a long time! And I love my cocktails! I have already booked again for a Christmas surprise for my husband. This place has the right balance between price, location and service unlike alot of neighbouring hotels.",5,2012,09,02
204,Bliss!,"Unfortunately I only stayed here for the weekend....what a fabulous hotel. Rooms are large, king sized bed and lyric fm playing softly in the background. Bathroom was beautiful and we had a view of the courtyard garden from our balcony. A little oasis of tranquility in the heart of St Stephens Green. Staff were efficient and service in the bar excellent.....they have a wonderful cocktail menu!! The shops of Grafton street are only a few steps away and if it's raining the kind doorman will provide you with a huge umbrella.",5,2012,09,02
204,"Great location, clean and friendly","Nothing but nice things to say about the Fitzwilliam.  If you're looking for something central, you can't beat the location.  The staff was friendly and attentive in every way, providing an extra plug adapter, an umbrella and directions with a smile.  The restaurant serves a nice breakfast, and the bartender knew his business too.  The only thing I'd improve would be the gym, which was little more than a closet with three machines.  But I mean, I didn't come to Dubin to exercise.  Would stay there again, no question.",5,2012,09,01
204,Best location in Dublin,"Stayed in the hotel while visiting dublin, we had to book in early since we had just arrived from USA. The room was not ready when we got there (10 am) so we had breakfast in the restaurant, which  was given to us for free (i had a coffee and my wife had French toast) we got into our room around 11.00, so they were very accomading.
Great location across from st Stephen's green, and at the top of grafton street.  And the staff are great. And it is also attach to a great michelin star restaurant. Will stay here the next time we are in Dublin ",5,2012,08,31
204,Outstanding Location and Service,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin at St Stephan's Green for a few nights while in Dublin recently.  The rooms are large and spacious with a king size bed and all new decor.  The cafe Citron served full and continental breakfast options each morning and the chef's choices for dinner were top of the line in terms of taste, creativity and presentation.  This hotel is walking distance from major attractions like Trinity College, Grafton Street shopping and the Temple Bar area.",5,2012,08,30
204,5 star friendly,"There is always a risk with a 5* hotel that it can be a bit snooty.  However, The Fitzwilliam is full of class and refinement with a typical warm Irish welcome and helpful staff throughout.  Having read the reviews before, there were the usual moaners.  I had one minor issue on my Bill which was resolved immediately with a sincere apology.  Room was spotless, bed comfortable, location perfect - an ideal Dublin hotel.",5,2012,08,28
204,Took excellent care of my family and employees!,"The hotel was recommended to us by a local who lives in Dublin.  In addition to the recommendation it appeared on the map to have a great location.  

The location did not disappoint.  It's right on St. Stephen's Green which also happens to be the departure point for the ""Viking Tour"" as well as for both of the companies providing the ""hop on - hop off"" busses.  There is a major street just outside the hotel that is blocked from traffic and is full of shops and places to eat with tons of people walking around.  We found Dublin to be pretty walkable and you can walk to most of the attractions in the city from the hotel.

The hotel staff were very professional and the rooms were quiet and neat.  They were happy to accomodate early check in if the room was available (mine was - others were not.)  We had requested a roll-away bed for our son who was traveling with us.   The hotel staff had said they would bring one up during turn down service but when we arrived at the room it was already set up for him (a nice touch!)

We ate one night at Thornton's (the fancier of the two restaurants.)  Good service and the food was tasty.  My experience dining at expensive Irish restaurants is quite limited so I don't have much to compare it to.  

Breakfast was good but the service was a bit spotty.  We had a full Irish breakfast included in our stay (which requires you order it off the menu.)  Some mornings were better than others but the food was good and you're in Europe and not in a big hurry anyways right?

Hotel lobby is pretty small. In fact the entire hotel is quite cozy.  This is a boutique type hotel - not some huge Marriott.  Its what I wanted/expected/got.

I should also add that my trip was part business and part recreational.  In addition to traveling with my family there were another 10+ employees of mine staying at the hotel with me for a conference that we were having at the Guinness Storehouse.  We had an event at the hotel conference space (in the base) in one of the evenings and everything was perfect.  They had the projector set up just like they promised and the hotel staff was all set up to go with the bar we had requested.  They even poured the whiskey my Irish partner had made special for the event (for a small ""cork fee."" )

I also spoke to many of our employees and other guests who were very happy with the hotel.  Our conference speakers also stayed here at the hotel and were quite impressed (many cited the awesome location.)

Finally, the hotel staff was great at helping out with the little things.  In addition to putting on the event we held at the hotel they worked well with our bus driver who took people to the Storehouse for the conference.  They helped us to carry stuff for the conference to our car and the loaned people converters.  

Couldn't be happier with my stay!",5,2012,08,27
204,Funky and glam in a great location,"Spent a night here two weeks ago and loved it. I have been fortunate enough to try out eight top Dublin hotels in the last few years and think that this, along with the Shelbourne is my favourite. Great location right on the green, we were only 3 floors up but the soundproofing was excellent. Lovely room, compact but had everything we needed including free wifi. I hate when expensive hotels charge for this service! Did not eat in the hotel so can not rate the food. Extremely nice service, even more so afterwards when I realised I had forgotten my Kindle and the hotel was most helpful in sending it after me by taxi. If I had to make one criticism It is a small one - some of the bathroom towels were a bit threadbare - small housekeeping issue! Overall a super place.",5,2012,08,27
204,"Great rooms, but where was the service?","The Fitzwilliam is perfectly located on St Stephens Green and just steps from Grafton Street.  We had two rooms overlooking St Stephens Green which were compact but well furnished, clean and had fully functioning wifi - an essential for my two teenagers.
Outside the rooms, it was a bit of a poor experience.  Check-in - the hotel were unable to locate our booking.  We booked on-line via the hotel's own website on Saturday for a Sunday arrival.  Reception said they were not automatically notified of bookings made at the weekend...!  After eventually finding our booking, we were told that the rooms wouldn't be ready for 40 mins but we could have two rooms together overlooking St Stephen's Green. This was fine as it was before the normal check-in time, so we went for some lunch and did some shopping on Grafton Street. We returned two hours later and were told that only one room was ready. We went to that room and found that it wasn't one of the rooms we had been offered - it overlooked the interior courtyard/garden.  This disjointed service is not what I would expect from the Fitzwilliam. 
Checkout was similarly frustrating with the receptionist being difficult to understand due to her mumbling and not having a strong grasp of English. 
All in all, great rooms, great location, but let down by the service they pride themselves on.",3,2012,08,26
204,"Very nice, great location","An exceedingly friendly staff, perfect location. Not sumptuous in the rooms, but nicely done. Chocolates at turn down, tea/coffee in the rooms. Breakfast is quite good. Concierges make great restaurant recommendations.",4,2012,08,25
204,Great place to stay in Dublin.,"So well located right at the foot of Grafton Street.  Walk to everything. Talk to the consieger he will tell you about some amazing restaurants right in the area. Don't miss the ""hop on hop off"" bus. Get the 2 day pass excellent value. Loved the location of the hotel, excellent staff, parking included. Great rates.",5,2012,08,23
204,Would not have changed anything-great experience!,Best location in Dublin with comfortable beds and a staff willing to help with anything.  We had two rooms that overlooked the park as we were traveling with teens.  Our daughter was celebrating her 16th birthday and the hotel had a few chocolates with a happy birthday note waiting for her in her room.  It was a lovely surprise and a good example of how hard the staff work to make this an exceptional hotel.  We would definitely choose to stay here again!,5,2012,08,23
204,fabulous,"Great location. Easy to walk to a variety of attractions and catch a breath of nature in St. Stephen's Green. The attention to detail was impeccable. Staff exceptionally cordial, well trained, well informed, and gracious. Gorgeous floral displays, chocolates at turn down time, beautifully decorated.",5,2012,08,23
204,"Nice hotel,good position but orrible breakfast","Very good hotel ,nice and very confortable room,the position its perfect in the very city centre,but Orrible breakfast,the breakfast hall its like a factory lunchroom.The hotel staff it's very polite and helpful",4,2012,08,22
204,Very Good Hotel very good located,"I recommend this hotel due to  the modern and confortable installations,  the kindness and professionality of the staff,  the central location , the  calme of the rooms , the confortable bed, the natural flowers in the room...
Everything was very good.",5,2012,08,20
204,5 stars in stylish and relaxed hotel,"Having stayed in a number of 4/5 star hotels in Dublin over the past few years, this hotel represents the best Dublin has to offer for price, decor, service and location.

Prior to arrival I contacted the reservation team to arrange for a bouquet of flowers to be left in our room (celebrating our wedding anniversary) and also if we could have a room away from the noise of the street - I was dealt with by an extremely pleasant and professional staff member who organised all of the above for me - along with a complimentary upgrade.

All staff, from reception area to bar were worthy of the hotel's 5 star standard - friendly, polite and non-intrusive - an ideal combination.

We ate at Citron Restaurant, which was a great experience - food and service were excellent.  The cost is comparable with similar restaurants of this standard in Dublin.

When booking my next trip to Dublin we wil be staying at this hotel.

The hotel combines 5-star luxury with a relaxed stylish atmosphere.",5,2012,08,20
204,The place to stay at in Dublin,"Perfectly well situated, opposite St Stephens Green (park), and 2 minutes walk from the main shopping and entertainment street (Grafton Street). Good breakfast buffet, helpful and friendly staff. The beds were extremely comfortable (I have a back problem and quite touchy on the subject). I'll definitely return to the Fitzwilliam.",5,2012,08,20
204,Great Hotel,"This hotel was excellent. It has a wonderful location, great staff, very comfortable rooms and a great choice for breakfast. On check in they made sure we knew every thing that we needed to know about the hotel. Our car was parked for us and basically made everything easy and hassle free which is just what we wanted for a short break. Excellent !",5,2012,08,18
204,The Perfect Place to Stay in Dublin,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is directly on St. Stephen's Green and just a few doors down from the entrance to Grafton Street. We were walking distance to many shops and restaurants, and just around the corner from the stop for the Hop On Hop Off bus tours. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the beds are luxurious, and the bathrooms are large and elegant. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony overlooking the Green. These rooms are a bit smaller than the others but the balcony was wonderful. However, the weather in Dublin does not always cooperate as far as balconies are concerned so you may be happier in the larger room w/o the balcony. We will probably opt for that on our next trip. The service was the best. A great hotel in a fabulous location.",5,2012,08,17
204,"Good location, good service","I stayed at Fitzwilliam only one night but I couldn't have chosen better. I stopped in Dublin for a one day shopping, so the location of the hotel was perfect for me. The staff was very helpful and polite. I had to wait for a room for about 20 minutes but I didn't see that as a problem. The room was clean, big enough, luxurious - exactly what I expect from a five star hotel. Breakfast was good with enough food to choose from.",5,2012,08,15
204,Short one night stay,"Excellent welcome warm friendly staff lovely bright room and a happy birthday note with chocolates, would recommend this hotel, perfect location for dining out and nightlife. Breakfast served until midday a great surprise.",4,2012,08,14
204,Visit to Dublin,"Myself and my young daughter stayed here, We really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were so up to date, very nicely decorated, very clean, new and very practical with hair dryers etc easily at hand. My daughter especially enjoyed the more than usual hotels, spacious bath. The only problem we encountered was the main meal wasn't varied enough for us, my little girl would have enjoyed a more child friendly menu for her main meal as her tastes venture to more nuggetts and chips kinds of things. The breakfast menu was really good, a great variety on offer and very tasty.  The area of the hotel was amazing so close to everything including the Stephen's Green park right accross the road was a great place to visit. We really loved the atmosphere at the hotel. All the staff were really nice, everyone was so friendly, warm and so helpful. Overall, we will definately be returning to the Fitzwilliam hotel.",4,2012,08,14
204,Disappointing,"I booked a stay at the Fitzwilliam with high expectations expecting a fabulous experience especially due to its 5 star status, Unfortunately I was severely disappointed.
Arrived after lunchtime expecting room to be ready encountered staff on reception who were unprofessional and abrupt did not get a warm five star welcome (eg good afternoon sir,explaining about features of hotel etc) Why was I treated differently from other guests who paid the same price? Was billed for breakfast even though I had this included in the ""breakfast is on us"" rate reception could not find on their computer did not apologize.  Room good decor,spacious and comfortable but not exceptional felt their was something lacking expected a wow factor. On a good note the concierge were exceptionally pleasant and helpful.
Overall this hotel I think does not meet five star status.
I left detailed written feedback for management on my departure but have yet to get the courtesy of a reply.",2,2012,08,13
204,Top class hotel in a perfect position.,"I go to Dublin every year for business and after tryingn a few other places always opt for the Fitzwilliam. The location is perfect, the rooms are spotless and the staff are extremely helpful. Its the best place to stay in Dublin and the best value for money out of the top hotels.",5,2012,08,12
204,Great Experience,"Just checked out of the amazing Fitzwilliam after a lovely girlie night out in Dublin. Would really recommend this hotel. Staff were welcoming to the extreme, cocktails in the bar were excellent, Alex our bartender made amazing drinks and was so lovely to chat to, and our room was bright & spacious. 

Location is perfect. 
",5,2012,08,11
204,Best Hotel & Staff in Dublin,"My wife & I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights in Early August. The hotel was perfectly located and the rooms were top notch. exactly what you would expect for a hotel of this caliber, but... the staff was the best part of the hotel. From the front desk to the concierge everyone went out of their way to make our stay wonderful. Arranging a rental car for a trip up north, helping us get tickets to a sold-out Oscar Wilde play, and up-grading us to a beautiful room with a terrace without us asking, they really outdid themselves. We felt right at home as soon as we arrived.
When we return I can't imagine staying anywhere else. Thank you Bud, Patrick and all the rest of the people who made out trip so wonderful.",5,2012,08,08
204,Lovely but is it 5star?,"A trendy hotel right on st Stephens green, with handy car parking. Hotel feels slightly 90's, but still cool. Room was a bit small but functional, beds were comfy. We had our 2 year old with us, not really a hotel for families. Dinner was swish (ruby wax was sitting beside us!) but not fantastic and service was efficient but not overly friendly. Breakfast was not really 5star standard, the merchant in Belfast is 5 star, this hotel is close but not close enough.",4,2012,08,07
204,Phantom charges in an average hotel,"My wife recently stayed here with work and whilst not blown away with the hotel felt it was adequate UNTIL we received a bill for phantom mini bar charges on our card 3 days later.
On checking out the receptionist had stated there was nothing to pay (the Wagamamas down the road offered a better value meal) but days later the phantom charges appeared.
At the moment we are awaiting a decision from the hotel over whether my wife is telling the truth or not...

Key Points:

The location of the hotel is pretty good (as other reviewers have stated St.Stephen's and Grafton Street are nearby).

Sound proofing (as with a lot of older European hotels) is not great. 

Rooms are small (in comparison to most US hotels) but decent sized in comparison with London hotels).

On the expensive side because of its location.

Staff aren't exactly customer-friendly (see above).",3,2012,08,07
204,"Amazing ""Baptism"" to Ireland","We just wanted to thank the staff at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for their kindness and hospitality. The hotel is beautiful, charming, and comfortable. The location was perfect, as was our stay. We will definitely be back in the future and look forward to recommending your hotel to others in the future. Thank you Fitzwilliam and staff!",5,2012,08,07
204,Great Retreat,"We extended our trip after an ""All of Ireland"" tour and were definitely delighted with our choice to spend the extra 3-nights stay at the Fitzwilliam.  Location is perfect and was walking distance to  quite a  lot of attractions.  We had a wonderful room overlooking the courtyard on the second floor..real quiet, private and I loved the orchids!!  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  Had a great dinner at Citron....",5,2012,08,06
204,Treat Yourself,Great Service and wonderful rooms. We are budget travellers who decided to lash out (a bit) and found it well worth our while,5,2012,08,06
204,Great location...decent stay....pricey,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam twice during our visit to Ireland (two nights at the beginning of our trip and one night at the end).

PROS:
-Location!  the Fitzwilliam is centrally located and within walking distance to most attractions.  It is right on St. Stephen's Green park and at the end of Grafton Street (shopping). 
-Decor: the rooms are very modern with clean lines and stylist furniture.
-Staff: friendly and helpful staff, especially the bellhops.
-Size: rooms and bathrooms were quite large, especially for Europe's standards.  We slept 3 adults (one queen bed and one double-sized sleeper sofa) very comfortably.
-Parking: there is a garage right next store that validates for the hotel for only $10 euros or so.

CONS:
-Price: rooms in July were almost $500 and breakfast was not included.  In hindsight, we really didn't think it was worth it since we spent so little time in the room
-Noise: the hotel is connected to a restaurant/bar/nightclub and has heavy traffic at night.  During our first 2 nights, we actually heard dance-type, pounding music until 3am.  For our visit at the end of the trip, we asked for a quiet room away from the club and were so thankful for the peace-and-quiet.  The second room overlooked an empty courtyard, so ask for this room type.

Overall: would stay again if prices were in the $200 to $300 range.",3,2012,08,05
204,"Night (andd day) mare in ""luxury"" hotel","Worse experience ever in hotel in my life. Check-messed up, rude staff, left until 4.30pm to check in for 1 night stay. Expected to pay for upgrade as room we booked no longer available. Bar locked so couldn't get to complimentary waters. Instead of twin room 1 ended up on a sofa bed. They didn't even manage to have it ready by 2am when we got back. Had to go wait in the bar while they made it up. Drinks were vile",1,2012,08,02
204,A little slice of heaven.....,"After a dreadful hotel in Galway City we decided we needed to stay somewhere nice for our last two nights of vacation.  This is THE PLACE.  Concierge was amazing as were all staff.  Rooms were very clean and sleek.  I especially enjoyed the fresh flowers.

Location worked well for walking to most everything in Dublin.  Concierge also helped us find some nice restaurants.  

Relaxing place with amazing service.  The only down side is that drinks in the bar were a bit much but considering it is a higher end hotel that was to be expected.  Excellent whiskey selection as well.",5,2012,08,01
204,Wonderful Stay,"Twin Room:  1 Umbrella was setup in your room which came in handy b/c it rains alot in Dublin.  Twin beds are larger than the other hotels I stayed in, very comfortable.  

Concierge/Bellmen:  They are extremely helpful, friendly.  I made the guy go back to the storage room multiple times to look for my luggage, but he never showed any frustration and was genuinely helpful.  They are friendlier than the front desk staff.

Breakfast:  The breakfast that was included was very simple continental breakfast plus hot items.  On our first day, there was a buffet setup with hot items, but not on our 2nd time coming back.  We ordered off menu.  Service was ok.

Location:  convenient and is right next to all the shopping malls/stores, restaurants and pubs.  You can easily walk everywhere (if it's not raining!)",4,2012,08,01
204,superb place to stay on st. stephen's green,"We spent three nights here in July.  A top-notch establishment with wonderful service and friendly and informative staff.  Rooms are generously sized and immaculate, and no detail was left untouched.  The lounge has a great menu and is open late for food and drinks.  Location is perfect for walking to popular Dublin sites, shopping, restaurants, etc.  I recommend it highly.",5,2012,07,31
204,"Missing your Apricot Scones from Tampa, Florida","We absolutely loved our experience at the Fitzwilliam.  The hotel location is perfect.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff was always helpful.  Living in the States our experience with Scones typically leaves us feeling that they are really paperweights for your desk and not something you would eat.  Well, all that has changed for us now, thanks to the breakfasts we enjoyed at your hotel, the highlight of which was our daily apricot scone.  Please pass our compliments to your baker and chef.  Absolutely delicious and will forever change our perception of what a Scone is supposed to be.",5,2012,07,31
204,Good value and well located,"We stayed here 3 nights as part of a guys golf trip.  The hotel is well located in a central square of Dublin.  Easy to valet park.  Rooms are nice, but not spectacular.  Clearly a 4 star, not a 5 star, but perfectly acceptable.  One of the concierges, Sean, was really great and helped us with a few things.  The bar was nicely set up for pre-dinner drinks.  They didn't really have a spa, but there is one woman who provides massages, mani-pedi, etc in a small room on the 3rd floor.  The only annoyance I had happened just as I was checking out, when the room keys I had got disabled and the front desk implied it was my fault and gave me a new one and hat didn't work either. So I had to trudge back and forth 3 times until a bellman had to let me in.",4,2012,07,30
204,Have Dessert at Citron!,"We spent one night here and it was grand.  The property is modern, immaculate and stylish, the staff is world-class professional.  The room was stylish and modern.  We had dessert at Citron, the staff was happy and friendly and the desserts were wonderful.  Breakfast the next morning was at Citron and it was great, buffet, sausage and eggs, I asked for white toast and got six half slices on a chrome server.  I wish we had spent our entire stay here.",5,2012,07,28
204,Nice hotel but service was inconsistent,"The hotel is updated and the rooms are modern and clean but I found that the staff was either friendly or somewhat distant.  There was a really nice gentleman working the desk at check-in, but on another occasion there was an unsmiley and uninformative front desk lady.  Also, the breakfast buffet advertised was available one morning, but not for the other 2 nights we stayed.  We had to order au la carte so didn't have much to select from.

Overall, rate paid was reasonable and the rooms were clean, but I probably wouldn't go back due to the inconsistencies.",3,2012,07,26
204,Fantastic 50th birthday experience!,"I booked this hotel for 2 nights for myself and my friend as it was her 50th birthday. I have to say from start to finish our experience was first class. The hotel arranged some birthday treats for her which was totally unexpected and made her day as due to family circumstances she rarely gets a break away.
All the staff from front desk to concierge toi cleaning staff were excellent and so polite and kind and totally sincere. Our twin room was one of the best I have stayed in in the UK. It had everything and more that you could possibly want. The bathroom was a great size with good power shower and very big bath- great for relaxing. We had a quiet room overlooking the courtyard which suited us fine. The breakfast was also one of the best I have ever had and it simply had everything you could possibly want. The location  was ideal opposite St Stephens park and very close to all the shops.
I would not hestitate to recommend this hotel and in fact hope to return one day with my husband and would not even consider staying anywhere else.",5,2012,07,24
204,2 day stay,"Perfect location, professional and fun staff, quality accommodations.",5,2012,07,23
204,Written confirmation does not mean confirmation,"Despite the negative title for this review, I don’t wish to put people off staying here. There is a lot going for it.

I’d stayed here regularly a few years ago, and loved it. I’d become familiar with the different room types, so was very specific when I made the latest booking (by phone): an executive room with a queen bed (not one of those hateful zip-links), overlooking the courtyard, and definitely not on the smoking floor (fifth). I mentioned that I’d been offered upgrades to front-facing rooms in the past but had always turned them down, preferring the quietness of the courtyard-facing rooms. Although the rooms overlooking St Stephen’s Green are generally bigger and have great views, they suffer from street noise and the sounds emanating from the nightclubs below. It was all confirmed in writing. However, when we checked in, we were given a room at the front! We hoped that keeping the window shut would keep out the noise, but it was not to be. Unable to sleep, we contacted reception. We were offered a room on the fifth floor, so that was no good. Next came the sixth floor. The lift doesn’t go this far, so you have the use the stairs. These rooms are tiny, with less storage space and a sloping ceiling. They feel crammed with furniture and claustrophobic. We were then offered a room on the second floor; perfect (exactly what I’d originally asked for) but for the zip-link bed. The concierge, Bob, agreed to swap the bed if we didn’t mind staying up a bit longer. We were happy to do that, but then the duty manager told us it wasn’t possible (I won’t bore you with the details). We were finally offered 350 – a bigger room with a queen bed, and a balcony overlooking the courtyard. But there was a catch: it had been promised to someone arriving the next day and we’d have to move again! We decided to check out the following morning and move to our favourite Dublin B&B: Ariel House in Ballsbridge. Miraculously, they had a room at short notice.

And so to the positives.

The location is fantastic (take the opportunity to walk down Grafton Street before the crowds arrive). The staff are friendly and helpful. Most of the rooms – notably the smaller, executive, rooms overlooking the courtyard – are very well designed. A wall of wardrobes and cupboards divides the bedroom from a small hallway. You can put suitcases and shoes here, leaving the bedroom uncluttered. There’s a CD player (with a speaker in the bathroom, although you can switch that feed off). The bathroom is wonderful, with dimmable lights, a huge bath (with a drencher shower over) and tealights (a lovely touch). The beds are comfortable. Although room 350 (for example) is bigger, I didn’t like the design: the door opens straight into the room – not great if housekeeping knocks and enters without waiting for a reply (although it didn’t happen on this occasion)! The food in the Citron restaurant (which has a balcony overlooking reception) is superb; the service is attentive without being intrusive. (While eating there, we were entertained by loud Americans practising their golf-swing in the foyer!) There’s parking in the basement (just 10 euros for 24 hours) and you can take the lift straight from there to your floor. We enjoyed spending time sitting at the bar. The cocktail menu is excellent, and the staff are chatty (if you want them to be). WiFi is complimentary.",4,2012,07,23
204,Wonderful hotel for families,"We had a wonderful time at this hotel. It's less than a five minute walk to the National Museum, the Museum of Natural History (which was an enormous hit with the kids) and Phoenix Park, which is lovely to walk through and has a great play ground, and just minutes away from the main shopping and dining area.  It's wonderful to be so near all these things, but not have the noise and the ruckus of the pubs. The hotel really knows how to take care of kids.  And the staff went out of their way to make sure that we were comfortable and point us in the right direction. We'll certainly go again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2012,07,21
204,Nice Stay,"Lovely hotel right in the heart of Dublin. We stayed here for one night while attending a Bruce Springsteen concert. 

It was a rather quick visit to Dublin, but being 34 weeks pregnant I wanted to stay somewhere with a little luxury. The only negative was the shower, I waited at  least 5 minutes or more for it to heat up but alas no hot water!",4,2012,07,18
204,"Trendy, friendly, great food and atmosphere","We really really liked the FW. Great location at the south end of Grafton Street, adjacent to St Stephen's Green and the LUAS stop.
Superb check-in service, friendly, welcoming and polite. We ate in Citron on our first night, the food was delicious, beautifully presented and service was discrete and friendly. Breakfast selection is extensive and delicious. The rooms are well appointed, bed was beautifully comfortable, bathrooms are stylish with large tubs and drench showers. Decor is trendy and eclectic with interesting use of fabrics.
We will certainly  return and next time head for the 2* Michelin restaurant which if our other experiences at the FW are anything to go by it will be superb. We have already recommended the FW to friends and will continue to do so.",5,2012,07,18
204,Good but not perfect.,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel for a weekend over the july holidays and for the most part enjoyed it. As others have said the hotel is in a great location at the top of grafton street with the park directly opposite. We also visited the guinness factory and the zoo and had a great weekend break.

The rooms are clean and functional with a bit of style thrown in the mix also, the food is first rate with breakfast being very fresh (I'm fussy about my orange juice!) and tasty. 

There's a car park under the hotel which is a blessing as street parking is tight to say the least, it's 10 euro but that's a not bad when you see the price of car parking in Dublin.

The staff are friendly and polite with the girl who booked us in showing us right up to the room and the concierge being very helpful at every opportunity.

The 2 negative's we experienced? After looking on the website we rang up and requested the deluxe premium room which I was assured we were getting, I even asked the girl what the difference was over the deluxe room, she wasn't able to tell me but said it was worth the extra. Now I can't say for sure but I'm pretty sure we got an ordinary room it as it was a fairly small room with a combo shower and bath, not the luxury expected when booking a top room in a 5 star hotel.

The other thing was the noise from the nightclub next door, it very much disturbed our sleep and if coming at the weekend make sure you request a room at the back of the hotel.

Overall we probably would return but be more careful about the room choice.",4,2012,07,15
204,Perfect location,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin is in a fabulous location beside Stephen's Green, minutes from great shopping along Grafton Street and across the street from public transport. It is a grand old hotel with a gracious and well functioning lobby.  The staff is very friendly and helpful whenever you have a question or need a hand.  The rooms are spacious and immaculate.  The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is large and well supplied. There is a bar and restaurant and when we arrived very early from our flight we were able to order the food we required.  I would definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel again when we return on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2012,07,15
204,"Good location, friendly staff, value for money","Good location, friendly staff, value for money. Staff will collect you at the door and take your luggage, rooms very tidy and clean, great hotel",5,2012,07,15
204,Great rooms and service,We were there for four nights from 6 July 2012. We enjoyed our stay and the central location was just marvelous. The staff were very helpful. Rooms were spacious and well furnished. The queen size bed was very comfortable. Location and service were the best highlights of our stay.,5,2012,07,14
204,"Central location, could walk everywhere.","Lovely hotel in a perfect location. Best nights sleep in Ireland. Everything we wanted was within easy walking distance. The hop on, hop off bus stop was 1/2 a block away. The 2 day bus ticket allowed easy access to attractions further out of town.  Wonderful concierge made reservations easily into choice restaurants & activities.",5,2012,07,13
204,"Wonderful hotel, friendly staff","It has been a very busy travel month for me - the upside is that I can rate hotels objectively and comparatively. Typically I stay at Westins but the Fitzwilliam was such a pleasant surprise. For the business function I attended, the Fitz delivered in all aspects. 

The service was superior and genuine. The food in the restaurant was very good. And the rooms are smart and comfortable with a wonderful bed and spectaular pillows! And - so important nowadays - in room wifi that works well, and is included. Well done!

Agree with other reviewers re: the drapes/shades allowing too much light to enter -this wasa common complaint of my colleagues as well. Bathroom faucets were quite fussy - but my goodness, these are tiny nits!

LOVED IT - will return!",5,2012,07,12
204,"Contemporary, stylish hotel, centrally located, nice rooms","Lovely rooms, very stylishly appointed, and extremely comfortable. Perfectly situated on Stephen's Green, in walking distance to attractions, shopping, restaurants, etc.  Pretty good service, although the concierge was inexperienced, so despite his lovely demeanor and good intentions, he could not guide us well.",4,2012,07,12
204,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a few nights in June and it was wonderful.  We arrived at 10am after an overnight flight.  The staff checked us in early and was so helpful and friendly.  The hotel is in a central location and most of the main tourist attractions are within walking distance.  The rooms are well decorated and large for European standards.  They also had bathtubs, not common in Europe.  They provided a turn-down service nightly and each room had an umbrella-a must for Ireland.  Wonderful hotel.  I would highly recommend it!",5,2012,07,10
204,Excellent location and nice rooms,"The staff were friendly and service was terrific. The hotel is steps from good shopping, sight-seeing and restaurants.",4,2012,07,10
204,Great location and excellent value.,"My wife and I just returned from a five-night stay here and we loved it.  Great location next to beautiful St. Stephen's Green... literally a few steps away from the shops and buskers on Grafton Street... only a short walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar, the River Liffey, and plenty of good pubs and restaurants in the immediate area.  Our ""signature"" room was very nice, clean, and comfortably spacious enough for the two of us (in fact, much more spacious than our hotel room in London last year... and for less money!).  The staff was excellent, friendly, and helpful, and we were especially grateful for the early check-in.  Great job Fitzwilliam!",5,2012,07,09
204,Perfect stay!,"My husband and I booked here, as recommended by a family member and we weren't disappointed . This trip was a 24 hour break for us to see the Stone Roses at Phoenix Park.
First of all the location is perfect, straight out of the hotel and onto Grafton Street! The staff are friendly and looked after us extremely well.
Our room was gorgeous and had everything we needed. The bed was really comfy, much needed after a gig and long walk back!
The Inn on the Green was fantastic for cosy drinks and people watching. Breakfast was one of the best we have had - plenty of choice without being oversized.
We look forward to our next trip! ",5,2012,07,08
204,Great value and style,"We just returned from a 4 day stay at the Fitzwilliam. The Hotel is modern but minimalist in nature. The colors and branding (F's on everything and everywhere) are done so well and work with the decor so seamlessly, they were hardly noticeable. Every detail of the hotels appearance is done well. We had a bad leak in the air conditioning duct the night before we left (for a very early flight) which made for a difficult nights sleep (what started as a slow drip became a huge puddle and steady drip before long). The ""gym"" is really a misstatement: it is a very small room with no windows and minimal equipment. These problems aside, we would definitely stay here again. It is great value for a hotel facing St. Stephens Green and the service was wonderful and the staff very welcoming.",4,2012,07,07
204,Nice hotel and good location,"The room I had was a bit small - booked off orbitz - and it was (i think) the smallest room they had (queen bed) but it is laid out so it does not feel small & you have ample space for luggage (I was alone though - might be more tight with 2).  The bathroom is also small but very nice and water pressure is good.  Heat / ac worked well and were quiet (I managed to use both - Dublin is not hot - but the sun heated up the room).  The beds seemed hard to me, so I slept on a comforter on the mattress.  Not a big deal - housekeeping made the bed within 10 minutes of me asking. 

The service was very good - I was really impressed by them.  I liked the location, and it was the best value of the other top hotels in Dublin at the time I went.  I would stay there again.  The other staff were also very friendly & helpful.  I was there 6 nights & some of the staff actually knew me by name.  They went out of their way to help with everything (and I was paying the cheapest rate in the cheapest room).  

I think this is a good business traveler hotel for Dublin too...when I was alone at the Shelbourne and Westbury in the past, I felt like I should be with a significant other.  I didn't get that feeling here.  Most people in the lobby seemed to be on business (e.g., with laptops) and doing their own thing - not holding hands, sipping drinks together, etc.  Of the 3, this and the Westbury were the best for me - the staff were more friendly & the price was better.   Location is good for all three.   

The internet does occasionally disconnect and ask for a password... I saw that in a few other reviews... it was sort of annoying - but it doesn't happen if you are using a program...only if idle.  I have yet to get skype to work in any Dublin hotel - internet speeds are not great.  

If you come in late at night - the door is locked & there is no place to put your key to open it like most American hotels...you have to knock basically... and one night I came home & the night staff apparently stepped away so I stood outside waiting... which can be a little uncomfortable in the city center at 2 am.",5,2012,07,07
204,"Great hotel, just a five out of five","I stayed at this hotel on business, it's good for business or pleasure. It is right in the centre of Dublin, just perfect. I've stayed at 4 other Dublin hotels and this location is best - you have shopping, the park outside, trams, hundreds of restaurants and all the sites. 

The lobby is nice with seating. good bar also and breakfast restaurant. Staff were all nice, plus a late check out. The rooms were well decorated, fresh, new and clean. This is more of a modern hotel, but not ultra. Good tv channels, radio and a safe. I'm big on comfortable beds and this hotel has them, with nice pillows. Free wifi, which is always a bonus. Tea and coffee making. Plus good lighting and plenty of sockets. 

A few negatives - the curtains are no black out, thus in the summer it is light ish in the room from 5am... The gym is more of a box with 4 machines. Not normal UK or USA gyms, but it wasn't busy. Tea and coffee, means basic instant coffee, again UK/Irish, but is usual for us. The bathroom taps are mad! They are like fine jet sprays, I would have those changed in an instance if I owned this hotel, they make a mess and are barely usable!! 

I would stay here again, the negatives are not so bad. The location, clean hotel and good beds make up for a few small things.",5,2012,07,03
204,Convenient as well as very friendly and helpful,"Went for a short city break with wife and baby - this hotel is a godsend! It was smack in the middle of Dublin - what more can you ask when St. Stephen's Green is just opposite the road, Grafton Street about 30 metres around the corner, and the tram system just directly in front of the main doors of the hotel!! Really couldn't ask for a more central and convenient location. 
The service too was top-notch - they were really friendly and very accommodating. We checked in late, near midnight, but there still were 2 staff members manning the counter. Check-in was quick and brilliant - helps a lot as our baby was sleeping and very tired. 
Room wise - couldn't fault much with the rooms as they were clean and uncluttered. The towels were of good standard, as well as the bathroom having a nice monsoon shower to use! Careful though about the fridge, as every bottle had a microchip in it and will trigger a sale if the items are moved for more than 15 seconds I think! (Learnt the hard way although again the staff were really accommodating and cheerful when we said we had to move some bottles/drinks to put the formula milk/bottles in there. The mattress however can be a bit more firm as it was soft-ish a bit. However, can't fault the duvet and pillows they offered - they were very comfy and made us sleep better. 
Going about Dublin too was a cinch as the tram system was just in front of the main door - it took about 15 minutes to arrive in Dundram were the big shopping mall was sited. However, St. Stephen's Green was also just opposite the road which was really handy and convenient too. Grafton Street was just a walk away, and even though we had to carry the little one with us, it wasn't too much of a bother. 
All in all, we were glad to be able to catch the hotel on a sale and therefore the price certainly was more than a reason enough to book this hotel. We will be looking for further great deals again next time when we decide to visit Dublin. More than highly recommended!!",5,2012,07,01
204,"Mark&Adrian Great stay, great hotel & great location","Everything about this hotel was excellent. From our arrival and assistance with check in to our check out and departure we could not ask for a better experience. Be sure to set time aside time 
for a relaxing visit to St Stephens Green directly across the street. We found the breakfast buffet during the week to be plentiful and on weekends the breakfast was more extensive. In addition to the buffet breakfast, dishes were also made to order. Be sure to start your day with one of their excellent cappuccinos. Our room was on the fifth floor overlooking the garden and was nice and quiet. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful especially Joanna and Viktoria. In the Citron Restaurant for breakfast and great service say hello to Cassandra.",5,2012,07,01
204,Another Simply Outstanding Stay at the Fitzwilliam!,"I will not go on at length as I wrote previously about this tremendously wonderful hotel from prior stays here.  Simply outstanding in every way from check in, to an unexpected upgrade, to a tremendous room service dinner which I had on the balcony overlooking the Green.  The manager on duty (Marie I believe but may be miss-remembering her name) called my room soon after check in to ensure all was okay.   The Fitzwilliam has top-notch service down to perfection.  Never snotty, just that perfect mix of hospitality and service one comes to expect from a great hotel.   This time I was staying elsewhere (the Clarence) but had to check out after three hours due to the fact that the air conditioning in my room was not working and they could not repair it until the morning.  So I was frustrated by the time I got to Fitzwilliam but within an hour here I was relaxed and savoring a beautiful evening in Dublin.  Easily among the best two or three hotels in Dublin and my favorite!  And compares favorably to many of the finest hotels in the world that I have experienced.  Fitzwilliam.",5,2012,07,01
204,Class hotel with central location,"If you are looking for a hotel that has it all in Dublin city center , this is the hotel for you. Fluffy bathrobes, slippers deco rooms, plenty of staff for checking in and out( 3 people behind desk , both times)spotless .",5,2012,06,30
204,Great Experience!,"This is the 4th time I stay at The Fitzwilliam, and the service and friendliness of the staff remains as good as the first time I visited Dublin. I would stay there again if I needed to. The premises are clean and very well kept, the Staff is always caring and helpful. The restarurant and its staff are always nice and kind.

Would stay again",5,2012,06,26
204,Not good if you're disabled!,"Very disappointing, would have expected a lot more from a 5* hotel!  

I had made every effort to organise a room with a shower as due to my disability I am unable to use a high sided bath to bath or shower.  

I had emailed and spoke to reservations, which for the record were very helpful, so I fully expected to get the room type I reserved, especially as I had to pay for a Deluxe Premium Room to secure a room with a shower.

We had arrived around lunchtime, the doormen were very courteous.  They took our luggage and parked our car.  Our room wasn’t ready, which wasn’t a problem and the doormen kindly offered to take our luggage up to our room when it was ready.

After spending an afternoon seeing the sites of Dublin we returned around 7pm, got our room key, had a quick drink in the bar, where unfortunately there was a drunk person at the bar who tried to talk to us but in fairness the bar staff chaperoned him off us, only for him to go off to the toilet and come back and start to annoy some other guests.

We finished our drinks and went to our room.  On first impression the room was very nice, we had a balcony overlooking St Stephen’s Green, unfortunately due to my disability I couldn’t climb the step and out over the window sill, but my wife, brother and my sister-in-law went out and were very impressed.  Then my wife said to me there’s no shower in the bathroom.

I phoned reception advising them that I had requested a room with a shower but there was no shower, the receptionist said she would look into it and phone me back.  10 minutes later there was still no word back so I phoned again, she said they were still working on it.  We were running late for a dinner reservation so I said I would come down to reception to discuss the matter on our way out.

When I got to reception I was told there were no rooms available with a shower as the hotel was full that night and all the rooms were allocated.  I explained my situation and that I was unable to climb into the bath for a shower and I had paid for a Deluxe Premium Room so I could avail of a shower.  There was nothing more she could do and suggested I spoke to the manager.

I spoke with the manager and he explained to me that they had my booking and that reservations had my email requesting a shower but due to human error the information had not been passed on to reception so that they could allocate me an appropriate room.  After some discussion I was offered the “exclusive” use of the “day room” on our floor as it had a shower.  I then queried the price I had paid to secure the Deluxe Premium Room, the manager agreed to reduce the rate to the basic rate.  Although this was not ideal it was a compromise, but I would have expected this to have not happened in the first place from a so called 5* establishment such as the Fitzwilliam.

The next morning as I went to my “exclusive day room” I noticed that the door was open to it, which I thought was strange.  When I went in I found to my unpleasant surprise that someone had already been in the room and had used the toilet without flushing!!  I hope I don’t have to go into more detail to explain but I’m sure you know what I mean!

All in all we go to Dublin a few times a year and would use the Four Seasons.  We used the Fitzwilliam this time as it had been recommended by friends for its central location and my brother and sister-in-law were staying there as a gift from our parents.  Although the Four Seasons is further out of the city beside the RDS, it’s only a few minutes in to the centre by taxi and you don’t have to pay extra for a shower and clean toilet!",1,2012,06,26

204,Excellent Hotel,"Great hotel located right in the centre of Dublin with very helpful staff, good athmosphere in the bar area and very comfortable well decorated rooms. The only fauly I had was with the breakfast which was a let down for a 5 star hotel - perhaps we should not have ordered it too the room as it limited our choices and the processed bread and fry did not appeal to us on its arrival. All in all great time, great place and will be back",4,2012,06,21

204,Fitzwilliam in Dublin,"We only stayed for one night and had a delux king on the second floor.  We had read about noise issues and the room size, but found neither to be a problem.  The window, overlooking St. Stephen's Green, was double glazed and when I asked about the noise, the woman showing us the room told us that they had taken the cmoplaints to heart and the extra window glass was to fix that prroblem.  I felt that I had plenty of room with a little sitting area and the bed.  The staff was exceedingly helpful.  

My only small complaint was that we chose to grab lunch at the bar in order to get out to an exhibit for the afternoon.  Although everybody was extremely friendly and polite, it took over half an hour to get our food.  The food was great, but a little long in coming.  

Otherwise, it was a lovely comfortable visit.",5,2012,06,18
204,"Nice, Centrally Located Hotel!","This was a nice hotel.  We stayed on the 5th floor and had a balcony, which our kids (they were in the room next door) thought was great!  The rainfall shower was incredible!  The beds were very comfortable, the rooms were quiet, and we appreciated the free wi-fi in our room.  We found the location of this hotel very convenient for everything we wanted to do.  There were restaurants, shopping, bus tours, etc. all within a couple of minutes walk.  We were very pleased with our stay there.",4,2012,06,18
204,"Good location, good for business","Location is great for both business and leisure in Dublin.

I had a Queen bed room overlooking the courtyard on the 5th floor, which I found small but adequate for a solo business traveler staying just 2 nights.  If I'd been on holiday with my wife I think we would have found it cramped.  The room decor was good and tastefully presented, although closer inspection showed that some aspects were a little tired (frayed carpet at the edges).  Each night there were two handmade chocolates in a box on the pillow, a nice touch which is less common now days.

The shower was mounted in the bath-tub, but was a fixed vertical rainfall style setup.  It had only two speeds: on or off, and was exhilarating to say the least.  It was like showering with a high-pressure hose - a true decontamination experience!  I quite liked it.  Predictably though I managed to flood the bathroom as given the volume of water coming out there's no room for error!

The lobby and entrance are not as grand / opulent as some of the competing hotels in town, but still sufficiently stylish.  The restaurant where breakfast is served overlooks the lobby from the mezzanine floor.  Breakfast was good and included in my room rate.  Real ""fresh"" orange juice was present - my minimum requirement for a decent breakfast.  The setup is a hybrid buffet / a-la-carte setup but all included in the same price.  It was a little confusing on the first morning as I wasn't sure if hot food was included or not.

Overall, its good for business and I'd go back.  If I was going with my spouse it would have to be a bigger room - not sure how much extra this is.",4,2012,06,17
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We spent a day in Dublin on both ends of our vacation to Europe and stayed at the Fitzwilliam both times.  If I ever make it back to Dublin, I'd fully expect to stay there again.   It was a great experience.  Amazing location, very helpful staff, nice rooms (awesome beds), good wifi in the rooms, etc.  I'd highly recommend it for any travelers spending time in Dublin.",5,2012,06,16
204,Dublin's best. Don't bother looking elsewhere.,"This was my second trip to the FitzWilliam, the first being a business trip a couple off years ago. 

We arrived to be given an upgrade to a Deluxe Premium with a balcony view over St Stephen's Green. Super! A bottle of champagne with that view is definitely the way to ""do"" Dublin. 

The staff were uniformly excellent, helpful knowledgeable and plentiful. We dined in the superlative Thornton's restaurant (not cheap but worth every single penny), then collapsed back into the bed bed in Dublin. So comfortable and quiet. 

Absolutely, without a doubt, I would go there again and highly recommend it to anybody.",5,2012,06,12
204,Great Hotel,"We arrived in Dublin on our honeymoon and we stayed the first two nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The Porters were very quick to retrieve our bags and were very pleasant to deal with.  They assisted us with directions and recommendations.  When we arrived in our room there was Happy Honeymoon marked on the television screen and there was a happy honeymoon layout on the desk with chocolates and such.  It was a very nice added touch.  The room was very nice and because we were on the fourth floor we had a balcony.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean and modern.  The location was excellent, located right next to Grafton Street which is the main shopping area and it is close to lots of pubs.",5,2012,06,11
204,Not as good as it used to be,"I've stayed at the Fitzwilliam in the past and I liked it's design air, the location and the service. The location stays the same and the design is pretty much the same but unfortunately the service is not what it used to be.

On my last visit I've had a few problems that, taken separately, do not account to much, but together, it made my stay finally uncomfortable. Basic task that should be seamless and easy (things like accessing the wifi, having breakfast or printing a boarding card on the last day of stay) seems to be problems to overcome. I have the impression that staff simply have been around for too long to actually enjoy their work. When I gave feedback at the front desk about how they should improve they blankly stared at me just waiting for me to go away... not the best way to improve.

I feel they should hire back whoever was managing this hotel a few years ago.",2,2012,06,10
204,"Fantastic hotel, with fantastic service, in a fantastic location!","My partner and I have just returned from an absolutely amazing 4 days in Dublin - staying at the wonderful Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect - on the beautiful St Stephen's Green at the very top of Grafton Street.  Literally everything is on your doorstep, and there are a multitude of bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk, and the slightly over-rated Temple Bar area is just 15 minutes walk away.

But back to the hotel. It was my partner's 40th birthday, and I wanted everything to be perfect.  We arrived off an early flight out of Bristol, and although our room wasn't quite ready they assured us they would call us.  When it got to 12pm I popped back to the front desk to ask if our room was ready.  The lovely Laura said that it wasn't but she would see what she could do.  She immediately and calmly made the decision to upgrade us to an executive room with a balcony overlooking the Green, and with a cheeky wink said it was ""As a treat""...  Now that's service - thank you Laura!!

The room was simply stunning - spotlessly clean, with every possibly amenity, and with a bath that I literally couldn't touch both ends of...  It was a fantastic base for our break, and we left feeling very pampered, cared for, and valued as guests.

It was our first trip to Dublin, and we'll certainly return - and the Fitzwilliam is in our opinion the only place to stay.  Brilliant all round, and highly recommended.",5,2012,06,08
204,"Great beds, huge bath tub- bring your cd's too!","I loved this hotel, the ambience was great, service was friendly and they have a lovely CD library and book library in the lobby where you can lounge and just read a book by the fire. Each room had has a cd player. We stayed in an a smaller room with a queen bed but they had a window chaise and the bathtub was antique style that was nice and large. Beautiful modern hotel in a perfect location- just off Grafton street near the park",4,2012,06,08
204,Great location with wonderful service,"Spent a long weekend at this hotel. Located at the top of dublins busiest shopping street, Grafton St, which has lots of trendy stores as well as souvenir places. Right across from St Stephens green a beautiful park with ducks to feed and a kiddy playground. The Luas, a light rail public transport system is right across the street also. Our room overlooked the green. It was light, spacious and well appointed, with robes, slippers, a chartreuse footed tub and a walk in shower. The staff were very efficient, pleasant and attentive, with readily available umbrellas, restaurant advice and nightly chocolates. Breakfast at the restaurant CItron was very varied, hot and cold selections with pots of tea and coffee, jams, jellies and toast at every table. The bar was modern, lacking any atmosphere, but the bar man was adept at whipping up good looking cocktails. I would definitely stay here again. Had a wonderful time.",5,2012,06,07
204,Bring an Alarm Clock and Check Your CC Statement Twice!!,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for two nights. I'm not sure I've ever had a stay start out so pleasant, but end so poorly. I will say that the check-in process was wonderful and the staff gave excellent customer service as I was shown my room in person and my luggage arrived immediately from the bell hop. The room was clean and to my liking, and I was beginning to think I'd found myself a real gem of a hotel.

We had an early international flight Sunday morning, and so we needed to wake up at 5:30am. Traveling from America, I knew my cell wouldn't work in Europe so I didn't bring it with me. There is not an alarm clock in the room, so my only method of waking up on time was to request a wake-up call. The man at the front desk cheerfully took my request and I *watched* him write it down in the 5:30am cell for the next morning. Our call came at 5:48am, and the man who called didn't even bother warning us he was calling almost 20 min late.

We quickly got ready to leave and went downstairs to check-out. The man at the front desk told me I owed an additional 2.75 euros. I asked why and he said ""mini bar charge"". I explained I didn't take anything out of the mini bar except the complementary water. Apparently the min-bar fridge has these stupid automatic sensors that if they detect something has been removed they automatically charge your room. They also fire if you bump one of the bottles (which is especially problematic since they encourage you to take the free water out of the fridge), so apparently it's not uncommon to get erroneous charges. He assured me that it was no problem, that he would remove the charge and not to worry about it. Late to the airport because of the late wake up call, I trusted him and jumped in my cab.

Sure enough...I get home and look at my credit card statement. There's the mini-bar charge that showed up 2 days after I checked out. It's not a lot of money (and I actually let my credit card company fight that battle for me by disputing it)...but what a disappointment from a 5 star hotel!

However, since I had such a positive initial impression of the hotel, I decided to make my complaint privately before writing public reviews. I emailed the hotel company...and was completely ignored! I can certainly forgive a few missteps from a poor employee, but for the company to ignore a complaint from a customer speaks volumes about their commitment to customer service, in my opinion. After all, I paid more for those two nights in Dublin than I did to rent a cottage for an entire week in Kerry county...they could at least type out an apology.",2,2012,06,07
204,Nice place in central Dublin,"Modern, clean, centrally located hotel. Great staff. Did not try the restaurants. Our room was adequate, a tad small. No complaints.",4,2012,06,06
204,Sunny days in Dublin,"From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by Fergel, Alan and Bud - we felt at home.  Our flight to Dublin Tuesday evening was cancelled, so unfortunately we did not land and get to the hotel until Thursday morning - we were upgraded to a beautiful room overlooking the garden.  I can't say enough about the wonderful way we were treated by everyone who works at this hotel.  We spent two glorious nights here and then at the end of our trip 12 days later, spent our last night here.  Our room this time overlooked St. Stephens and on the morning of Saturday, June 3rd we had a fine view of the Wicklows, albeit a short view as the weather changed and they became obscured by the incoming clouds.  Ah well.  It was still a grand way to end our vacation.",5,2012,06,03
204,Nice place to stay,"Whilst travelling on business I'm always keen to be able to stay in a hotel that offers comfortable beds, quiet AC, good quality fittings, free Internet, friendly staff and a decent breakfast. This hotel delivered on all accounts but just lacked something but I'm not sure what exactly. 

The hotel is set in a very central location close to all the central attractions and bars. Perfect for late night out in Dublin. It's spotlessly clean everywhere and to a good standard.

I felt the room rate I paid should have included breakfast, there was a good selection of hot and cold food at breakfast. The staff in the bar were very friendly although the drinks were expensive. There is free underground parking which was handy albeit tricky to find the hotel.

The gym was tiny, almost not worth making the effort to go. I ended up opting for a run outside instead.

I would recommend this hotel and probably stay again if my company would pay the €175.00 per night room rate.",4,2012,06,02
204,Brilliant staff!,"I stayed at the fitzwilliam last week and by mistake my booking had been made for the previous night. As it was made on a late booking style website with no refunds it was entirely my fault that I booked the wrong day. The reception staff worked out that I had booked the wrong day and honoured for the day I actually arrived. What impressed me about this was that I did not have to ask or persuade, they did not ask for any fee or admin charge and they did it quickly and without fuss. I was more than impressed, plus the room was very comfortable. 

Highly recommended.",5,2012,05,31
204,"Great location, wonderful staff.","Spent 3 nights, great location and friendly informative staff.  Water was shut off one day for an hour or so when we weren't even in our room and concierge left us 4 complimentary drink coupons in our room. Great sight seeing suggestions from staff members. ",5,2012,05,29
204,Excellent rooms,"Last minute online deal brought us to here, great location just off grafton street. The lobby area and bar aren't on a par with other 5 star hotels we have been to but the standard double room was finished to a very high standard, as was the bathroom, queen bed not king but very comfy. Courtyard view overlooking the interior garden was lovely, these rooms are quiet, not sure bout the ones facing onto Stephens green at the weekend. Would go again for a night in Dublin though would be mindful of price compared to some of the city's other 5 stars. ",5,2012,05,28
204,Fitzwilliam Hospitality and Convenience,"Our daughter and I met in Dublin after her semester in Spain for a weeklong father-daughter experience. The Fitzwilliam was the perfect launch for our time together and visit to Ireland. 
We arrived early on Friday(Father tired from overnight flight) and were greeted warmly, quickly escorted to our room and made to feel welcome. 

The location of the Fitzwilliam is superb--directly across from one of the most beautiful parks in Dublin(St. Stephens Green),  easy walk to shopping and dining, safe walking distance to most of Dublin's attractions, and more.

The hotel staff were professional, extremely attentive and always pleasant in spite of my repeated questions and changes of plans. Full breakfast was served warm and warmly  and we fellt as though we were guests in a home vs. hotel visitors.

My next trip will include another stay at the FItzwilliam.

I extend my thanks to Patrick,  Bronough and others for making our stay special.

Sincerely,

Mark H. Merrill",5,2012,05,27
204,Charming hotel near St Stephen's Green,"We spent three nights at this charming hotel - I would return in a heartbeat. Excellent service, great location, lovely rooms. Concierge employees couldn't have been more pleasant or informative - front desk staff escorted us to our room at check in and answered all of our questions. This was an outstanding small hotel with every amenity needed.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2012,05,25
204,Smart Central Ease,"Fitzwilliam was Fab - couldn't be central right by Stephen's Green - room was great looking onto central courtyard - love the CD library which they deliver to your door and there's a speaker in the bathroom.  Staff were excellent  -  prompt, friendly  and polite.
Would highly recommend for a weekend break particularly if you aren't planning on straying too far from D2 area.",5,2012,05,24
204,Delightful but not perfect,"We read the reviews and thus were advised of some of the problems that others had experienced at this hotel.  Overall, do not stress out about the negative comments.  It is fantastically located in an area where you get the best of Dublin in a few steps from the front door.  The service is terrific.  Be mindful that service in cafes and the breakfast buffet at the hotel will be more European than the lets-get-them-out-the door service (with quick step music to boot) you get in the USA.  Unless you plan to enjoy the nightlife and be out in the clubs until 2AM, do not take the rooms with balconies on the green.  However, much to management's credit, when we complained of the noise, we were immediately given a great room off the garden.  And we loved the window seat.  Having traveled a bit, we offer this fact:  a five star in one country is not a five star in another.  So we gingerly offer that this is not a five star in other countries in which we have traveled and compared to Adare Manor in Limmerick, Ireland.  Yet, an overall delightful place with its own character and willing and eager staff to make your staff the best experience.",4,2012,05,23
204,Fantastic Service,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights.  The staff was excellent and very helpful.  Location was fantastic, right on St. Stephens Green.",5,2012,05,22
204,Home away from home - Loved this hotel,"This was my second time in Dublin for business but my first time at the Fitzwilliam. I stayed 10 nights this visit. This hotel is absolutely charming and lovely. The service was amazing, the room was so comfortable, and the little touches like a chocolate turn down made my visit fantastic. I loved my balcony view of St. Stephen's Green. Location was perfect and close to all my favorite places/areas.  

Great job Fitzwilliam. Thank you for your hospitality.",5,2012,05,20
204,Really Enjoyable Stay,Had a great stay here.Staff are efficient and obliging; helped promptly with all queries and requests. Location couldn't be better. Will stay here again.,5,2012,05,20
204,"Clean, but not that great",Service was soso.  Room (upgraded) was clean and quiet but a little outdated. Breakfast was good and complete.  Location was very good.  I would stay there again.,4,2012,05,19
204,It was a very good choice,"I have been very content with everything, especially with the friendly and helpfull service. They even helped me to get my sunglasses back, whick I forgot in a taxi going to the airport.
My weekend in Dublin was really very pleasant and I can really recommend this hotel",5,2012,05,16
204,100% accommodating and luxurious,"The staff are all so helpful and strive to make sure your every need is tended to. This was my second stay at the Fitzwilliam  and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Dublin. The location is great, in house food is great. Just loved staying there and enjoyed the HUGE bath tub and gorgeous toiletries!",5,2012,05,16
204,Disappointment and subpar service,"After booking a room in the not-so-well located Four Seasons we moved to the Fitzwilliam hoping for a more central location with equal amenities and service...  oh-boy how we were mistaken!  

The Fitzwilliam is nicely decorated and superbly located.  The rooms are very small... most rooms have queen beds and the mattresses aren't as comfortable as they should be.  The boutiquey decor makes it appear more like a Kimpton hotel than as what it bills itself--a five star property.

The bathrooms have one saving grace: enormous bathtubs--fit two people nicely and three in a pinch.

The hotel ""gym/fitness room"" is smaller than the bathroom we had at the Four Seasons... and it has zero natural light. 

The hotel has one of Dublin's finest restaurants: Thorntons.  It was what you would expect with one Michelin star restaurant.

The breakfast room is a little kitschy in decor but breakfast is adequate if a little expensive.

The hotel lost all of our respect when a 8:05PM wake-up call (a jet lag nap) was ignored which led to an irate call from me to the front desk at 9:20PM complaining about their mistake. They apologized.  I told them to be sure NOT to foolishly put it into their computer for 8:05AM.  Sure enough, at 8:05AM they rang with a wake-up call... 12 hours too late (and 3 hours too early for my jet-lagged brain).

Upon checking out I had nobody to vent to... why?  Because the man who checked me out never uttered the words ""how was your stay.""

Had he done so the answer would have been: A unique stay--never to be repeated.",3,2012,05,13
204,Best hotel we used in Ireland.,Loved the decor. Wi-Fi worked great. Staff was superb,4,2012,05,12
204,"Great hotel, due to location, service, beds & general desire to ensure you have a great time","Great hotel & service was fantantastic.  However I was very disapointed by the room size, after paying extra for an upgrade.  Like many of the other comments the walls are paper thin and all to often you can hear doors slamming across the corridor.  Also the promised copy of the free news paper did not arrive (seems to be a common occurrence).  However the goods points do outweigh the bad. The food was good and the qualitity of service made you feel very special.  I would stay here again, but for business only. ",4,2012,05,12
204,Very good rooms - poor breakfast service!,"As always the rooms and service in this hotel are excellent. My room had a 4 poster bed, huge bathroom looked over St Stephen's Green.....just perfect.  As always the breakfast service lets it down: the breakfast area is too small for the hotel and again I had to wait 25 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, the buffet had been depleted and not refilled.  It took a further 20 minutes for my omlette to be served.....very nice but I had to leave half of as I was late for work.  The excuse they had 3 coach groups......well since this was known in advance make alternative arrangements! The second day I had room service breakfast to ensure I had something to eat.....not what I would normally do as the breakfast buffets are better value.   The breakfast service always ruins my visits here.",3,2012,05,12
204,not what we expected,on a trip to dublin recently we stayed here  for one night as it was an old favourite of my dads. the heating and wifi didnt work but staff seemed friendly enough. food was plesant and room spacious :),2,2012,05,10
204,Nice - but two problems,"The Fitzwilliam is perfectly nice - great location, mid-Noughties decor, comfy bed, decent room size.  Two big issues: the WiFi is terrible (slow and cuts out frequently) and the curtains aren't big enough for the windows - so light streams in from 6am.  If you're not here on business, and come in the winter, it's probably not a big issue for you.  For me, who arrived late, had to do work, and get up for a big meeting, it wasn't ideal...",3,2012,05,09
204,perfect Dublin location,"We loved our stay at  the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  We had a double room with a very comfortable queen bed, and a large window overlooking  a garden rooftop courtyard. Our bathroom had a deep soaking tub. We especially loved the central  location at the intersection of Grafton street and St Stephens Green. The staff were very professional and helpful. My only negative comment is that there is an adjacent nightclub and we could hear their music late at night. The bed was so comfortable though, and we were so tired from sightseeing and Guinness, that we had no trouble sleeping.",5,2012,05,04
204,Excellent hotel,"This hotel was in an excellent location.  We were able to walk most everywhere and the bus stops were easily accessible when needed.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Rooms were very clean and quiet as well.  We had dinner in the bar one evening and the food was great and very friendly bar staff.  Only complaint if I had to pick one is the temperature on the shower was not consistent.  Overall, a wonderful stay.. highly recommended!",5,2012,05,03
204,"Loved the hotel, hated the internet access.","The hotel was just lovely. The service was awesome. Everything was great. Except the internet. I was constantly logged off, and had to sign in every time my computer went to sleep for even a moment. It was very difficult to work from my room, and I was there on business. It would be great if they had a week pass where you wouldn't have to log in over and over again to access the internet.",4,2012,05,01
204,Not really a five star,"Just spent a few nights at the fitzwilliam hotel. To say its a five start is a little misleading. The building architecture wise is all concrete overlooking a nice park, so the inside had to be good. It was like a smart travelodge to us. The hotel was clean and spotless but to call it a boutique hotel is a little far fetched. The breakfast was a buffet so hence a bun fight, people barging about for a selection which was ok. Paying £40 for it then to be told eggs were extra. The rooms were well designed although small. Sadly we got one near the lift so people coming back late were noisy and it was above a nightclub in rooms 203 to 210.

Would we go back, yes the location is 11 out of 10, for a simple smart bolthole ok. Next time though we would opt for a real five star.",3,2012,04,29
204,Just lacks ...something,"Great location, very helpful staff, modern lobby, pleasant room. Given all that it's hard to put my finger why we did not feel particularly enamoured by the Fitzwilliam. The room was just a bit too small and felt more corporate hotel room than boutique hotel.And like someone has noted below, we were offered the complimentary paper but it was not delivered. Overall go for the location and the comfort , but if you want a bit of character, something a bit special then perhaps look elsewhere",3,2012,04,29
204,Touch of luxury,"We returned from fitzwilliam week ago and can say nothing but that it was just perfect! We had a nice cosy room with a balcony overlooking St. Stephens Green what was beautiful especially in the morning when we woke up. Breakfast was nice, maybe I expected a bit more local products, but still enough of everything needed. Reception staff and porter very attentive. Rooms are cleaned twice a day. We felt like at home after a busy day returning to our room in the evening. Thank you again!",5,2012,04,27
204,Dublin hotel gem,"Just returned from a truly lovely stay. Great hotel, beautiful room, friendly very attentive staff",5,2012,04,24
204,Boutique hotel in perfect location,"The location simply can't be beat - steps from St.Stephen's Green and Grafton street. Easy walking distance to Trinity college and Temple Bar.
The hotel itself is nicely appointed with a modern lobby and a nice selection of restaurants (although there are also several restaurants all within walking distance). There is a also a small gym and free wired and wireless internet. I should note that Wi-Fi is provided by a 3rd party and can be spotty at times and required frequent re-logging but it was free.
The room was nicely appointed with a comfortable queen bed, a small table to do your work and flat screen TV. I had a wonderful view of the office across the street - if you enjoy watching other people toiling away to earn their keep whilst you sip gourmet coffee and chocolates, then ask for one of those rooms. Although there was little outside noise, the walls within are paper thin. I was regaled with a wonderful conversation about jet lag and demanding clients from my neighbor who was determined not to visit the sandman until late into the evening.
Fortunately, this hotel did not subscribe to the European trend of see-through bathrooms so expect to have a modern bathroom with no voyeuristic tendencies. The bathtub itself was gigantic and well-raised above the floor. I would urge caution to those not vertically gifted when using the tub / shower. The sink also seemed designed to splash water everywhere though this is not really a concern unless you are aqua-phobic. Expect the standard retinue of luxury soaps, shampoos and fluffy towels. The robes, however, were an itchy terry cloth and seemingly out of place with the rest of the accouterments. 
Service is as expected though I have to say that concierge did more legwork than the front-desk staff. There was also a complimentary Irish Times that was promised but never delivered.
If cost is of little concern, you enjoy listening to the woes of your fellow travelers as you fall asleep in 300 thread count sheets and want to be near almost everything Dublin as to offer, this is the hotel for you.",4,2012,04,21
204,Great for Dublin Staycation,"Needed to get out of the ol' flat for a night and this was the perfect place to go. Great location (next to Grafton St Area and Stephen's Green)... Close to great restaurants and shopping. Staff was lovely... Gave us a complimentary upgrade to the superior room. Bell staff were very helpful, even though we had limited luggage. 

Decor is cool and retro... Purples and greens and deep colored wood in the room. Very retro, but very hip too. Flat screen in room and we had a nice garden view. Very comfortable. Beds were divine with large pillows. Very quiet for a Friday night in Dublin!

Girlfriend went to the beauty treatment room and loved her time there. No fuss decor and outstanding service from Ursula. 

Bar downstairs was nice but a bit bright for a bar, especially in Dublin. 

Overall, great hotel. Would definitely return. Great for the staycation, business, weekend in Dublin etc. ",4,2012,04,19
204,Ideal for a night out or shopping in Dublin,"The rooms are really nice and trendy in this hotel.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in.  

We had nice cocktails in the bar before going out but the bar, breakfast area or reception doesn’t have the same wow factor as the rooms.

There were a number of our group us who sat down at once at breakfast and I noticed that many, including myself, had to ask for the basic things more than once like toast, butter, a cup. Service needs to be more focused.  

The location of this hotel couldn’t be better for Grafton St shopping and sightseeing.  Its right on St Stephen Green at the end of Grafton St, ideal and pretty location.",4,2012,04,19
204,Happy Days,"My husband and I spent the Easter weekend here and we were thoroughly spoiled and pampered by the staff. We enjoyed every little, extra touch provided by this hotel which made our first trip to Dublin extremely enjoyable. Thank you very much for the Easter Eggs, I am now converted to Butlers Chocolates forever. The rooms were really cosy and you felt wrapped in their warm embrace as soon as you entered them. Location is so central you couldn't ask for better; everything was either a walk or a bus journey away. The drinks might have been expensive at the bar but the banter with the staff made up for it, in our opinion. I recommend this hotel to everyone, you are worth it!!",5,2012,04,13
204,5 star hotel is right,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic the ony thing I can complain about is the price of the drinks at the bar apart from that the rooms,gym and breakfast wer all amazing would defo recommend it to anyone",5,2012,04,12
204,Great stay,"Just returned from a 4 night stay and thought The Fitzwilliam was great! We were upgraded to a room overlooking the courtyard which was very lovely. The shower was amazing! The only complaint we had was of the loud, heavy doors of neighbors slamming throughout the night.

We were there over Easter weekend and were given a large chocolate egg as a gift from the hotel our last day. Overall,  really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is clean, well kept, close to everything, and the staff was vey helpful.",4,2012,04,09
204,Wonderful!,"This was our first visit to Ireland, beginning in Dublin.  We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights before traveling on, and returned at the end of the week for one more night at the end of our trip.  My husband and I agree, this hotel is 5-star, all the way.  It is cozy and elegant, with comfortable beds and lovely amenities (including an umbrella)!  We were treated like royalty by every employee we came into contact with.  We enjoyed our meals at the hotel restaurant, Citron.  The dinners were superb ~ beautiful presented and delicious!  The servers in the restaurant were so kind and helpful...it just added to the warm welcome we felt all through our stay.   I cannot say enough about this wonderful little gem!  Oh, except the location is perfect, too :)  Thank you to all at The Fitzwilliam Hotel!  We will return!",5,2012,04,09
204,Weekend treat,"Just back from a two night break and would just like to thank all the staff at the Fitzwilliam for making it so enjoyable. A very friendly hotel ,lovely clean room with great facilities and the center of Dublin was just on our doorstep. We had a meal in the Citron restaurant which I would highly recommend as the food was very nice and very reasonable priced. So hope to be back very soon.",5,2012,04,09
204,"baeutifull hotel, great location","we stayed here during eastern. they brought us a chocolate eastern egg, complemantary from the hotel. nice people, very service oriented. nice breakfast. hotelrooms are nice, though little noisy, because doors slam.",5,2012,04,09
204,A little shabby for being highly rated.,"I was disappointed with the Fitzwilliam. I read great reviews from many websites and was expecting to have a great stay. Our hotel room needed repair work from the toilet handle practically falling off the wall to a chunk of glass missing from the bathroom mirror. Also, the walls of the hotel rooms are really thin. If I visit Dublin again, I will stag at another hotel. ",3,2012,04,07
204,Unless you need to!,"Just back from 2 night stay and not impressed. Should have listened to previous reviews. Front room on floor three meant no sleep for 2 nights because of the nightclub beside the Hotel. noise starts from about 11pm until 4am.
Ah well you live and learn.
Room was not worthy of the price for a 5* Hotel, though it was clean. 3 times asked for water for the room, 3 times none. Asked for paper 2 days incorrect one delivered.
They did reduce the price on checking out and I cannot fault that. But, I won't be back.",2,2012,04,05
204,A weekend to remember,"Can't wait to visit again, it might be a little more expensive but believe me it is worth every penny. Right in the heart of things yet really quiet once you step inside. The lobby is a great place to have a beer or a coffee and watch the world go by. The barfood is exceptionally well proced and very tasty and plenty of food on the plates as well. The room we had was on the 5th floor and we met some celebrities on our trip which was cool. The cocktails are expensice in the bar but there is a serious taste of more from them. Rooms are small. No pool.Car park is so handy. Stay here!!!",5,2012,04,03
204,amazing first time in Dublin,"the hotel is very very good, with good value for the service provided. the location is amazing, basically in the center of Dublin, with everything is with in walking distance from the hotel.",5,2012,04,03
204,Great hotel in a perfect location.,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam, the location its excellent, staff are very friendly and we would definitely recommend it.",5,2012,04,03
204,Really good.,"Stayed for two nights in March 2012 in one of their basic rooms.

Pros:
Excellent location, right on St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.
Polite reception staff.
Lovely decor.
Really comfy bed - best nights sleep for ages!
Good selection of toiletries in the bathroom and bathrobes were a nice touch, as were the candles and flowers.

Cons:
Shower was confusing to use and kept going hot/cold/hot/cold which was annoying.
TV reception was a bit patchy and I would have liked more movie channels.
Hotel staff didn't always greet you as you came in/left and doorman let the main door shut in my face on one occasion as he rushed out to meet some new guests...  Not a big deal though.",4,2012,04,02
204,"Great location, friendly staff","My wife and I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam for four nights. Our room was on the 5th floor at the back, so not overlooking St. Stephen's Green. It was compact, but had everything the average traveller would need including tea and coffee making facilities, an iron, ironing board and trouser press. Unfortunately the iron, ironing board and trouser press were all in the only wardrobe, which rather limited the space for hanging clothes! If I have any real complaint it was that it was difficult to regulate the shower water temperature with the result that we had to frequently step out of the shower to avoid bursts of very hot or cold water. Perhaps we were just unlucky?  It was also very warm in the room at night, even with the window open, which made sleeping difficult. Unfortunately the air conditioning was too noisy to leave on at night. We were visiting friends in Dublin and didn't have occasion to make use of the hotel's restaurant facilities.",4,2012,04,02
204,Nowhere near a 5 star experience,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a couple of nights on business having previously heard some good reports from colleagues. From the moment I entered this hotel, I was seriously underwhelmed by first impressions in every area whether it was service, room etc. After checking into my room which was quite small and somewhat tired in appearance with chipped furniture, damaged bath etc, I decided to use the ""gym"". I was also surprised that a supposed 5 star hotel could get away with having a gym the same size as a small hotel room (on second floor of hotel)- it is literally a hotel room which you use your hotel key to access. Also the gym/ fitness room has seriously limited equipment (i.e. ONE treadmill, ONE crosstrainer, ONE recumbent bike and some free weights), as well as no natural light in a very small room. The only good thing I could say about the fitness room is the fact that it is open 24 hours and I was lucky to be the only one using it the two times I used it during my stay, however I suspect that was because of the good weather outside during my trip. 
On returning to my room, I noticed very noisy banging pipes above the roof of my room and notified reception- it tooks them a further 45mins to come back to me and an hour beyond that to locate an alternative room for me and help me move my stuff over. Whilst I was moved to a much bigger room, the furniture and bathroom also looked tired within the room and a number of plug sockets in the room did not work etc, suggesting a lack of adequate maintenance. As it was now quite late after having to pack all my stuff up, I decided to order room service for dinner (rather than go out to find a restaurant)- again the standard of food was much less than expected from 5 star hotel- the main course was completely tasteless and completely overpriced for very low standard food. The service at breakfast left little to be desired. In addition, although the fruit selection of the buffet element of the breakfast appeared to look great, the fruits I tried also seemed very poor quality and also quite tasteless.
Finally although located in a supposedly quiet room overlooking the inner courtyard/ quadrant, the hotel still tends to be quite noisy as the bedroom doors seem to be very heavy and I was woken up constantly in the early hours by slamming doors.
I would definitely not recommend this hotel- cannot understand how it is rated 5 star. Would equate it to a 3 star at best. However, also find hotel ratings in Ireland overly generous and not in line with hotel quality elsewhere.",2,2012,03,31
204,Everything I needed,"I am a regular visitor to Dublin and am on a limited budget as it is work travel.  I managed to book in here having walked past it dozens of times before.
This hotel is all that you could want.  Stephen's Green is the best loaction in Dublin bar none.  My morning walk to clients across the green was just beautiful.  The hotel location is near to a plethora of great shops and places to eat.
The facilities are excellent, a bed that you can actually have a great nights sleep in, the TV, CD system and aircon all work well, and the bath tub is deep and fills quickly.  There is a treatment room where I had a massage (good) after having pulled my back out.  The decor is tasteful.  My only comment is that breakfast at 22 Euro was a bit steep for me as I do not see hotel breakfasts as a chance to pig out, but would just be after a light snack.  So I did not do this.  Overall fab,",5,2012,03,30
204,2nd Time around,"I stayed in this hotel 10 years ago and it just opened and it was a lovely boutique hotel in a great loaction.. This time it is still a good hotel in a great location albeit it is looking a bit tired and worn in places. Our Room was on the 3rd floor and we had a view of a office block and a bit of grass inbetween us, as we arrived on a Friday the office was still in use so had no real privacy! They told us we had been upgraded but the room was still small by ""superior"" standards! That being said it suited us.. We ate in Thorntons which was nice and we did budget for this , i did not think that there was a lot of atmosphere in the restuarant even though  it was full.. the food was and typically Michellin ..it was nice though. The conceirge worked very hard  to get us somewhere to eat on the Saturday night and when everything we fancied was booked he recommended a great steak house which was fantastic! Thank you",4,2012,03,27
204,Amazing Birthday Stay!,"Stayed here for my boyfriends birthday in January, it was a surprise for him and we were both very happy with all the hotel has to offer. They went beyond what you'd expect to make our stay a memorable one! We got a room upgrade and a birthday treat for my boyfriend. I think it shows a lot when a hotel makes the extra effort if they know you're there for an occasion! We had dinner in Citron, the food was AMAZING!! Breakfast was delicious, especially the hot chocolate! highly recommended!",5,2012,03,26
204,Great City Centre Hotel,"Great hotel on the edge of St Stephen's Green. Locaton couldn't be better. Service is exceptional, and the quality of rooms is high. Ask for a balcony room overlooking the Green. Restauant is great value.",4,2012,03,25
204,Fitzwilliam Dublin 2012,"We were in Dublin for St. Paddy's day...what a great trip.  The Fitzwilliam was close to all of the activities...the parade, the bars and all of the people dressed in their finest Irish attire.

The hotel was clean and the staff very friendly.  I would definitely stay again.",4,2012,03,24
204,Save money - go anywhere else,"This is not a 5 star hotel. It definitely was not what one would expect from a 5 star experience.
Grubby room, with tatty stained carpet was the least of it. I asked not to be put in a smokers room, instead they put me in a non-smoking room on the smokers floor. I wondered why the whole place smelled so rank. The pillows were stained, as was the duvet. We were told it was a 'garden room', but it looked out onto a building opposite, there was no garden. The service was non-existent. There is no atmosphere. You could be in an ordinary 3 star hotel anywhere in the world, yet you're paying 5 star prices. If you have to be in Dublin because of an emergency and there is no-where available to stay, then it's bearable, but if you can find a room anywhere else then take it and count yourself lucky - just don't waste money on this place.",1,2012,03,24
204,Great Service,"Comfortable rooms and central location make this my first choice business stay in Dublin.
Staff are very professional and helpful.

Rooms overlooking St Stephen's Green are sought after but noisy, if you want a peaceful sleep get one overlooking the garden instead.",4,2012,03,23
204,Irresponsible,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam last summer. The location of the hotel is central and we found a lot of restaurants in the area. The check in employees was friendly, but we reserved a Superior Room with Park view and got an Executive Room to the backyard. Well, after returning to the reception and complaining, we received the claimed room. The accommodation was very comfortable, stylish and the bathroom is scrupulously clean.

After an opulent dinner outside the Hotel we came back pretty late. Before I went to bed I need to smoke a cigarette. Yes, some of us still smokers - sorry. I went to the lobby and asked about a smoking area. The night clerk negated and told me, I have to go on the street in front of the hotel. He brought me to the door, opens it, sent me out, locked up and gone away.

I felt very unkomfortable. What do you think about a blond woman, standing alone in the middle of the night in front of a hotel and smoking? Yes – the male pedestrian thought the same. After a few clear offers, I revolved to the door and have to knock like a maniac to come in.
Well, the positive result was, I reduced the nicotine for the rest of our stay, but I did not come to the Fitzwilliam Hotel, pay €239.00 per night, to feel like a floozie.",1,2012,03,18
204,Such a terrible shame,"When you book a 5 star hotel you expect a 5 star place. The only good thing about our stay was the staff they were doing their best in difficult circumstances.  banging pipe work meant that in the end we asked for a change of room and when we were moved the bath had a hole in it!! And not just the plug hole, if you want a great stay in Dublin stay at the westbury we had a lovely stay there at the start of our trip",1,2012,03,16
204,Classy & Modern hotelw/great location.  Quiet as well.,"Wonderful hotel.  Would highly recommend to other people, family & friends!",5,2012,03,15
204,Fantastic hotel,"I stayed here for a four-night break, and had a lovely stay. The Fitzwilliam is a sophisticated, modern hotel with great access to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. I had a large, well-appointed room, that I found to be very comfortable. The bathroom was fairly big, with a bathtub perfect for soaking in. The staff were courteous and helpful. My room and all the public areas I came across were well-maintained. Staying in the Fitzwilliam was definitely the highlight of my trip to Dublin, and I would definitely return.",5,2012,03,10
204,A Great Hotel. For Business and when taking the Wife!,"Booked this hotel as it was recommended.
From the moment we, my wife and I, walked in we felt very welcome.
Booked primarily for a business trip but also stayed the weekend as my wife came along :o)
Cannot fault anything at this hotel. I have tried to find something that was less than 5-out-of-5 but cannot complain about anything.
I had booked a business package i.e room + breakfast etc.
Unlike other hotels, the package was great, with no hidden charges or the usual ""taxes"" tacked on the bill.
We wanted to hire a car for a trip to the ""K"" Club and to see the sights. All was arranged for us by the hotel without stinging us with some exorbitant hire rate. 
All the staff went out of their way to make our stay pleasurable.
Breakfasts were huge and had plenty of fresh fruit etc besides the usual fried food etc.
Overall I cannot fault this hotel. Fantastic value for money.",5,2012,03,10
204,"Lovely staff, great rooms and excellent food.","Having just spent one night in the Fitzwilliam, I wish I was staying for longer. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the rooms are scrupulously clean. I ate in the Citron restaurant last night and the meal was excellent. The parsnip and vanilla soup was out of this world. And the freshly baked cookies are scrum my. Can't wait to go back there.",4,2012,03,08
204,Great Hotel!,"My wife & I stayed here for 2 nights (Feb 26-27) and had a wonderful time.  The hotel staff were VERY friendly. We drove about 3 hours to get to Dublin and we arrived feeling a little frazzled.  We pulled-up to the front door in our rental car and they just took the keys and parked the car for us - that's what I call super service!  Very clean and modern hotel. Great location - right across the street from beautiful, relaxing St. Stephen's Green.   And, you can walk right up Grafton Street and easily get to most of Dublin's finest shops, pubs and restaurants.  I have no hesitation recommending this hotel to anyone coming to Dublin for a special getaway.",5,2012,03,06
204,"Fabulous, friendly","Well, where to start! Thel ocation of the hotel is great, the staff cannot be faulted - so helpfull. I was there as a single mum of a disabled child and could not have been better looked after!  The Republic were playing Slovinia and we had tickets - my son was made a huge fuss over by the hotel staff - he loved it! 
Nothing was too much trouble. 
A wonderful stay - we shall return!",5,2012,03,06
204,Excellent Stay,"Excellent stay. The room quality was outstanding. I just love the bed. I have never had a nicer breakfast in a hotel. I ordered off menu & I got exactly what I ordered without any questions or hassles. I'm vergetarian so I don't do the big Irish Fry up. However there was a big choice of fresh fruit, smoothies, cheeses etc. along with vegetarian options on the menu. There is a €5 supplement when ordering off menu but it was well worth it. ",5,2012,03,05
204,"Perfect location, perfect weekend","Stayed last weekend in the Fitzwilliam (24,25 March), the locaton of the hotel is fab!  Once you find the car park (tricky with Dublin's one way system) the stress ends, good value parking E10 per night.  Enjoyed an efficent and friendly check in, genuine offer of help with luggage and a well appointed room.  Attention to detail is obvious throughout the hotel as is customer service, every member of staff we encoutered was friendly and polite.  Breakfast was great on both mornings with good service and high quality breakfast items, minor quibbles might be only 1 shampoo and shower gel in a bedroom for 2 and the minimum number of towels provided.  Public areas well maintained although a little to warm.  Would return if the price was right!",5,2012,03,02
204,great hotel !!,"great location, great hotel, clean, practical, friendly staff;",4,2012,02,27
204,Nice hotel,"This is a very nice hotel right in the heart of center city Dublin.
My only negative is that the restaurant is VERY expensive.",3,2012,02,24
204,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay,Lucky for me I was passed from another hotel in Dublin after a mixed up booking and the Fitzwilliam were very accomodating and also honoured my rate at the other hotel. The staff were professional and courteous and provided a first class service. The decorations were opulent but not too over the top. The beds were very comfortable and the goose down pillows and duvet were pure luxury. The individual remote control air conditioning in the room was wonderful as I normally find hotel rooms too hot. The breakfast was sublime (one of the best poached eggs I've ever had) and they were very accomodating to a special request at breakfast. The chocolates were fabulous and overall I was very happy to be staying at the fitzwilliam. I loved the fact that I could step out of the door and almost fall into the shops on Grafton Street.,5,2012,02,22
204,Great All Around...But Mixed on Service,"This week, we stayed one night in the Fitzwilliam. It is rated as a 5 star, and I would say that is fairly accurate. The interior is great, rooms are well appointed - particularly the bathrooms with a bathtub practically the size of a swimming pool! 

Service was very professional and polished - in particular the doorman and another guy - this other guy, I am not sure of his job - porter or something - this guy was fantastic. He would bend over backwards to make guests happy and really exceeded expectations. His name was Bob and I cannot say enough good things about him!

The guy working the counter late at night though...this is where the service fell down. My girlfriend left her phone at a local establishment in Templebar. It was about 1:30 AM and we asked him to call the establishment for us, he initially really pushed back on us...I was actually quite surprised. He did it with a poor attitude, suggesting that I simply call the lost phone and wait for some random stranger to pick up on the other end. Even if we weren't from The States and following his suggestion wouldn't have cost me 3 Euro a minute on my phone...his response was very disappointing.

I was irritated and told him nicely but directly to call the bar and ask if they had found it. AT this point, he seemed to realize he had not been providing the right sort of customer service and called them twice over the course of the next 40 minutes or so...or so he claims, he had initially pushed back so hard that we weren't sure whether he actually every made the call or not. 

When I pay $500 US for a hotel room, I expect the 23 year old at the desk to place a simple phonecall for me. In anycase...that is an isolated event, and I trust it was a learning experience for him. 

I highly recommend this place based on its location (amazing), atmosphere, room touches and the like...We encountered three employees during our stay and 2 of the 3 were absolutely outstanding...the other, well...I trust he will learn eventually.",4,2012,02,20
204,Excellent!,"The location and accomodation are excellent!  The staff is extraordinary from management to housekeeping!!  We stayed from Christmas eve 2011 for 3 nights.  We arrived early and were immediately upgraded to a lovely , quiet room overlooking St. Stephens Green.
We had a couple of small issues which were immediately addressed by management with a smile.  Could not have asked for more.  The rooms were pristine, large bath with excellent amenities.  We were even gifted with a lovely Wicklow candle from Ireland. 
We were not aware that we had a breakfast package the lst day so check with the desk at checkin.  Breakfast is very nice and expensive if you only eat small breakfast. EVERYTHING is closed except in hotels on Christmas Day.  No trains, taxis or buses.  We stayed an extra night since trains did not run until Dec.27.  There was nothing to do but walk on Christmas Day but the concierge went out of his way to find us a free and fabulous 3-hour walking tour.
The only thing that is a bit short on delivery is the small & minimalist lobby.  You don't get the 5-star feeling when you first walk in.  The staff is all about 5-star!!
If you are US, make sure you request your bill  in Euros not US currency.  We have discovered restaurants, lodging and shops doing this more often and using their  own currency exchange rate.  You lose the benefit of the preferred bank exchange.  Our bill would have been over $50 more if we had not checked and management so kindly accomodating in correcting.",5,2012,02,20
204,Great location in Dublin,"Lovely hotel, very comfortable and stylish.  We stayed during October 2011 on a sightseeing trip to Dublin and the front desk staff were very helpful in providing details for the open-top bus tour we wanted to do.  

The only negative was the temperature in the room.  It was a very cold weekend and we were unable to adjust the thermostat to increase the temperature, we enquired at Reception and received no help, hence why I gave this 4 stars rather than 5.",4,2012,02,20
204,Would definitely stay again!,"The hotel is in a perfect location.  Also, we stayed in a twin room on the second floor facing St. Stephen's Green.  We never heard any noise as other reviewers have commented, and our room had very comfy beds.  Our room was always well-maintained and clean, and we enjoyed the H20+ bath products and turn down service with chocolates.  We were very tired after our journey and did not expect to be able to check in upon arrival at 8AM, but to our surprise, we were provided with our room!  It was wonderful to sleep after a long journey.  I have also stayed at The Shelbourne, but if given a choice, I would stay at The Fitzwilliam.  Thank you for a great stay, nice service and early check-in!",5,2012,02,19
204,Luxury and great location,"Lovely hotel, right next to St Stephen's Green so really central.  Concierge whisks your suitcase away as soon as you arrive and the next time you see it it's in your room!  Rooms really spacious and a lovely turn down service at night with chocolates on your pillow was a nice touch. Other nice touches include the radio in the bathroom and a CD player.  Great service all round.  The only disappintment was the gym which was absolutely tiny.",5,2012,02,18
204,5 stars experience,"rooms were very clean, delicious breakfast, wonderful staff, and, above all great location in city center.",5,2012,02,17
204,Lovely hotel that is a great one to escape in!,"My wife and I stayed here on a recommendation and we are so pleased we did. We choose the hotel for its central location but we have to say the staff could not be faulted for making you feel welcome and happy to help at any time. We took full advantage of room service, the concierge the bar and restaurant and have to say we were very impressed through out. We wouldnt think twice about staying there again. Oh! And another thing the bed was fantastic!",5,2012,02,13
204,Bring your own coffee!,"Just back from 2 nights in the Fitzwilliam.

Pros:
Great location;
Parking at a reasonable price;
Courteous and friendly staff;
The most comfortable bed ever.

Cons:
Cracked tile in the bathroom - not a good look for a 5 star hotel;
The most basic hospitality tray with out of date long life milk.

Is it too much to ask from a 5 star hotel for a decent cup of coffee?  Thankfully really good coffee shop next door but I did feel somewhat cheated that I couldn't make myself a nice coffee in the comfort of my own room.  Fitzwilliam, take a lesson from Swissotel, Berlin - Italian coffee makers in every room.  Now that's 5*.",4,2012,02,12
204,An oasis of calm...,"I found this hotel quite by chance some three years ago when my usual accommodation was full and received a very warm welcome. Over the intervening period I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam every couple of months or so and the service has maintained its same very high standard throughout. The Reception staff are always pleasant and welcoming, and above all efficient while the Concierge staff give unfailingly good advice when requested. The rooms are well equipped without being ostentatious and I love the toiletaries. And while it might sound strange I greatly appreciate the investment they have made in their curtains. When it comes to bed time I like a dark, quiet room and the hotel has not scrimped on the quality and above all thickness of the curtain materials. There could be a storm outside and I doubt whether I would hear it. I always wake relaxed and refreshed looking forward to a good breakfast....",5,2012,02,10
204,A very good Dublin Hotel,"Good location, nice staff, comfortable beds and a great breakfast",5,2012,02,08
204,Great for a short stay,"Stayed a night after visiting relatives for christmas and spent the day in the city. Central hotel close to the shopping district. Looks to offer good service and standards and does this well. Concierge was very friendly. Hotel is close enough to the main shopping areas wander back with any shopping and leave it and head back out. Breakfast was very good with variety. Room was clean and well appointed at this price point, satellite TV free wifi, very clean nice bathrooms, robes etc. On St Stephens green which is a lovely  park square and there'as a tram stop outside the hotel. If you like to stay in a nice hotel but don't want to break the bank this is a good option and I would use again",5,2012,02,07
204,Praiseworthy !,"Having experienced the Belfast Fitzwilliam, I thought I would give the original Dublin Fitz a try with my partner in crime , aka the Sexy Net Geekette ( SNG ) . We were not disapponted !  I have read some of the Reviews containing negative comments and I honestly did not experience their issues .Location is perfect .The  Hotel Car park is adjacent and accessible .Check-in was smoothe if little impersonal . We stayed on the 5th Floor in a Signature room. Well furnished , bright , QUEIT , clean and very comfortable . We had Dinner in the Citron Brasserie. The Food and service were excellent and the Maitre D. was the epitome of Irish charm , humour and hospitality ! Try the Macon Lugny 2007from the Wine List ( Excellent value ) . Breakfast in the Citron was simply  superb . The Best Full Irish on the planet ! Freshly prepared, high quality ingredients and cooked to perfection.  SNG had the Eggs Benedict which she also declared to be ""divine "" ! The Staff were consistently friendly and helpful. 

Overall a wonderful experience. We will be back !!",5,2012,02,06
204,Bed Bed Ever + Service = Simply Stunning,"Pros?

Seriously comfortable beds.  Modern furnishings. Genuine, helpful. service.  Location can't be beat.  Great restaurants.  Beautiful view over St. Stephen's Green.  Clean clean clean.

Cons?

Price.  Thought I was getting an upgraded suite room with a balcony and the room was amazingly small.  Bathroom was beautiful but a tad worn - shower door didn't close, shower head sprayed everywhere.  All minor faults but for an EUR 290 room per night, I had higher expectations.",4,2012,02,05

204,"Excellent location, great service, lovely bathroom","I was going to Dublin for business and my husband decided to come along so, for our first night, I decided to book a good hotel rather than the business hotel we would be staying in the next few nights.  This was lovely, from the early check-in (about 10am) to the late check-out at 3pm, everyone was as helpful as could be.  The room was lovely with an entrance lobby - great for all our wet clothes - and a very nice bathroom.  Room was reasonable size and comfortable, with a window seat that would turn into an extra bed.  The ""not-so-great""s: the towels were thin and a bit dingy, clearly seen better days; the shower, whilst lovely, had a very variable tempertaure and went from cool to scalding and back in seconds; and the breakfast was so-so and if it hadn't been included in the rate I would have been very disappointed with it.  We'll happily come back here though - we are coming back to Dublin in October and made reservations when we checked out.",4,2012,02,04
204,Worst experience of my life,"Stayed in this hotel early January - I purchased weekend away as a Christmas gift for my husband, which included diner, bed & breakfast and a spa treatment. Check in was uneventful, room clean but a wee bit small (we did have to change room after first night due to noise from St. Stephens Green area and Luas). Breakfast was poor, seats most uncomfortable, had my doubts about freshnees of food - lots of small food flies about. Although hotel was very quiet, service at breakfast was slow.

When I turned up for my prebboked spa treatment, the place was closed. After a few telephone calls with reception staff, who initally admitted an error they then tried to imply that treatment was booked for next evening. Appointmnet and a complimentary treatment was arranged for next evening.

Diner was booked for 7pm, and we duely arrived at dining room, ordered our food within 5 minutes and we sat and waited and waited and waited.....

After 50 minutes we were still waiting for our starters, we asked a member of staff who admitted that there was a problem in the kitchen. Our starter finally arrived within the hour and was poor. While we waited for our main course to arrive I observed one of the chefs in the kitchen ( they have an open window where customers can clearly see into the kitchen) mixing a white sauce. he kept stiring the pot and tasting the sauce - and yes he kept using the same spoon without clenaing it, i commented about this to my husband and siad I hoped neither of our dishes would have any white sauce. Can you imagine my horror when my salmon arrived with white sauce - i thought i would be sick but as we had waited so long for our food I said I would scrape sauce to side and eat the remaining food.When i tasted  my salmon it was ice cold, i then cut it in the middle and to my upmost horror it was raw in the middle. At this stage we had enough, left restaurant and demanded to speak to manager, however there was no manager on duty but we were assured he would be on duty first hing in morning and would speak to us.

Breakfast next morning was equally a disaster, cold etc ... I could go on but whats the point.

Manager was not availble the following morning - had to travel on unexpected business and has never contacted us regarding our experience. We did speak to a deputy manager but at that stage damage was done, we couldn't wait to get out of the hotel, we checked out ealry so I never got to avail of my spa treatments.",1,2012,02,04

204,"Great location, perfect service",I stayed at the Fitzwilliam whilst in Dublin on a work trip. The service we received was second to none. There were no requests that seemed too much and all the staff were highly professional and very friendly. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were in walking distance of everything and its close proximity to the park meant it was nice and quiet in the evenings. The breakfast in the morning was second to none and set us up nicely for the full days we had. ,5,2012,02,01
204,Bedroom Type Beware,"We recently stayed in the Fitzwilliam on St Stephens green - 2 night weekend break, bed only €304 total. I reserved an 'executive' room online and looked forward to staying in a spacious select room, a room of higher status than a standard. To my dissapointment I was allocated a standard room. While the room itself was nice, had all amenities and was spotless it was very small. When I queried this room allocation at the desk I was informed that 'Executive' is in fact standard and while my reply at the time was 'cunning marketing' in hindsight they created an expectation that was never met and I feel slightly tricked. Not the end of the world but I felt it was worth a mention.",4,2012,01,30
204,"What a beautiful hotel, looking forward to coming back","As it was my friends 40th birthday, we decided to go to Dublin. On arriving at the hotel, the receptionist couldn't find our booking, after some confusion the booking was found and she couldn't apologise enough so she offered us breakfast for Saturday and Sunday free of change. Finally arrived  to our room after a long walk down the corridor lol on very soft carpet and was surprised with our room, it was huge. The bathroom was very clean with a large bath and shower. We were presented with a glass of champagne for my friends birthday. The room overlooked the courtyard, not much of a view, but plenty of peace and quiet!!!! The hotel is very central and the hotel bar is open 24 hours to residents, the staff are very friendly. If your looking for a special meal try One Pico (French) or Saba (Thai) is a very nice, try the Porn Star cocktail. Temple bar is pricey and the prices go up every hour after 10pm. If your looking for a nice bar try Nearys down a side street near Brown Thomas or O'Donoghues. Overall we would return to the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2012,01,30
204,Great place to stay,Staff very helpfull great location I'd stay again. Rooms very clean. Food very high standered ,4,2012,01,30
204,shame about the noise,"We arrived early at the hotel, despite not expecting to be checked in the hotel said our room was ready. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was very large with both a bath and a large shower - the room had a big bed and views out on to St Stephens garden. We went out for dinner and returned to hear a disco in our room! We discovered that there was a night club three storeys below - not only could we hear the base of the music we could hear the words of the songs!!! We complained at midnight only to be told that the music went on until 1.30, we put earplugs in but we were still able to hear the music - this was disgraceful given the cost of the room - i expected a good night sleep. We complained again and were eventually moved to an alternative room at the back of the hotel. We were not staying in the hotel at a busy time of year and i don't know why the hotel thought putting us in the room they did was acceptable, in addition we were told that they received complaints on a regular basis. 

On the surface this is a good hotel however when you 'dig a little deeper' they do not appear to care about the experience of their guests. I will NEVER stay in this hotel again.",1,2012,01,27
204,Quite dissapointing,Stayed two nights in this hotel in January 2012.It was a birthday treat for my wife.In fairness to the management we were given a free upgrade.I found the room to be just ok certainly no wow factor that i expected from 5 star status.The bed was comfortable although not long enough to cater for someone 6' or over.Everything seemed crammed and not much room to manouvre.We had complimentary bottled water but the supply wasnt replenished the next day and i had to ask for this twice.I also had to complain about noise on the floor above  in the early hours of the morning.They appeared to do nothing about this and the noise abated about 4am. In general this hotel charges top notch prices but in my opinion mediocre service.In its favour its central and the pre show meal on offer in the Citron restaurant was good value and excellent service.We didnt avail of the breakfast as we found many places out and about offering good food at a much keener rate.,3,2012,01,27
204,Awful experience....would not recommend!,"We were very disappointed in our experience with the Fitzwilliam. Although it is the best location in Dublin, it was far from our usual 5 star experience at other hotels around the world. We had requested a quiet room away from service areas and we were given a room right beside the linen/chambermaid area. We had a party in the room next door on both nights and did not get a wink of sleep. The doors in the hotel are extremely noisy and all you hear is slamming all night and first thing in the morning. We complained and the receptionist took our valet fees off the total bill....not exactly a 5 star experience!!!",1,2012,01,25
204,Good but just not Amazing.,"I bought a web 'deal' to stay at the fitzwilliam as a treat. There are not many five star hotels in Dublin and I so I was excited to stay here. It was nice. The lobby was not that impressive. The rooms were nice. I stayed in a garden room, which was grand. It had a comfy bed and a window seat. The bathroom was nice. We didnt get breakfast as it was too expensive. (lots of places just outside to eat). The website said that parking was 10eur for an overnightter, but they didnt charge me in the end. I have no complaints, but IM just glad I got it discounted rather than at full price. (and the location is first class)

my rating is based on the poor value for money and the lack of a wow-factor that i'd expect a five star to have.",3,2012,01,25
204,Loved Fitzwilliam and Dublin!,"Fantastic Hotel!  We stayed for 4 nights and felt that we were at the best located hotel in Dublin.  Steps from Grafton Street, Stephens Green, Airbus, High Tea at Shelbourne and Hop On Hop Off Bus.  Trinity College and Temple Bar also just 5-10 mins away.  We did the Literary Pub Crawl which started at a Pub just 5 mins away and then hit all the pubs right near the Fitzwilliam.   Room was so beautifully decorated, loved the gorgeous bathroom with rainshower as well as the great H2O toiletries.  Turndown chocolates also delish.  Free internet too!  Would definitely choose to come back here again! :-)",5,2012,01,24
204,What a gorgeous hotel in a gorgeous city?!,"We arrived at the hotel and were swiftly checked in and even shown to our room. We stayed in a Deluxe room which was on the 5th floor. It had a terrace overlooking St Stephens Green and it was really something special. The rooms were decorated modern but contemporary. The 4 poster bed was a nice touch to the room too and the huge bath was good for two people to share. The toiletries in the rooms were lovely- even bought the ones we didn't use home! Check out at this hotel is 12 lunchtime which is also great as most hotels want you out by 10am these days. We asked for an hour later check out too which they accomodated. We were greeted by smiles and a good service throughout the stay, only staff critism was one of the bar staff who clearly was tired and had had enough maybe!? We had a quick drink in the hotel bar before bed around 1am sun morning. 

I didn't use the business facilities or the restaurant apart from breakfast but this was nice. Lot's of choice inc smoked salmon as part of the buffet. If you don't get a BB rate then it will set you back EUR22 a head. There are lots of places to eat outside the hotel if you don't want to pay that, including a Subway shop literally 3mins walk away.

The hotel is in a lovely location- opposite St Stephens Green and at the end of Grafton Street. Next to the hotels is one of the loveliest bars in Europe I have been too, was called the Dandelion Bar. At night it turns into a bit of a disco but you cannot hear from the hotel. The food in here was gorgeous. It is about a 10mins walk to Temple Bar area too which is convenient, and there is a tram stop and several airport bus stops within 5mins walk. 

You get what you pay for at a place like this. You won't be dissapointed, a truly lovely hotel.",5,2012,01,24
204,DMK,"Excellent location. Good rate. Dinner was wonderful, and our waitress was fab!. Beds were really comfy and staff most accommodating.",5,2012,01,24
204,Brilliantly located and wonderful service,"I had read previous reviews of this hotel before arriving and, together with its central location, they were the reasons why I chose to stay there. I was not disappointed. The staff were extremely gracious, welcoming and went out of their way to make sure everything went smoothly. I had one mini treatment included in my deal and the ladies at the front desk rang me on my mobile while I was visiting the city to put me through to the specialist to arrange an appointment, as had been promised. 
The mini treatment was fantastic and I can not recommend highly enough Ursula who is in charge of them. She was professional, warm, listened to my requirements and offered an outstanding service. She came in early to accommodate to my schedule and, in addition to her expertise, was a truly lovely person to meet. She is one of the Fitzwilliam´s treasures.
The room was fantastic, as were the levels of cleanliness and service. The business centre was up to standard and available even after I had checked out which I was very impressed with and thankful for!
The breakfast service was great, prompt, friendly, abundant and delicious! The concierge was wonderful, put a smile on my face and reminded me of why I like Irish people so much!
I will definitely be returning.",5,2012,01,21
204,Just the right amount of cool,This hotel is cool but without the painful uber hipness that you see in some other modern hotels.  The rooms are thoughtfully laid out and decorated and the staff is very friendly.  The location on St Stephen's Green is very central for sightseeing and is also on a main tram line that connects to many of the work locations outside of the city center.  This was my second stay and I was very satisfied both stays.  There was one small billing error upon checkout (charged for breakfast which should have been included) but it was promptly removed upon pointing it out.,5,2012,01,21
204,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed here on my trip to Ireland! Liked Dublin, lovely city. Hotel was beautiful! Lovely rooms, service, breakfast! Everything was really good, nice location too!",5,2012,01,20
204,Disappointed on Third Stay with Daughter,"Having stayed at the Fitz two previous times, I was expecting the same level of perfection.  However, we were assigned a room on the fifth floor which I understand does include some smoking rooms ... no wonder we kept smelling smoke.  My request was definitely for a non-smoking room.  I think that should include making sure the floor your guest is on doesn't have any smoking rooms at all.  The walk from our room to the elevators was like running in a Marathon ... very long.  The room was extremely small and given the price we paid, you would think you would get something a little more generous.  Since this trip was a gift to my daughter after the passing of her grandmother, I was hoping it would be special.  The bathroom was not very nice ... dirty grout and mold on the bathroom sink.  Our included breakfast each day, which I paid extra for, was not that special either.  I was too embarrassed to make any comments to the management, as I had spoken so well to my daughter about how wonderful the Fitz was.  I am not sure I would make another reservation at the Fitz unless I made myself perfectly clear, in writing, about my requests.",3,2012,01,19
204,Good central hotel,"Great location in Dublin with its own car park.  Nice hotel room and good quality furnishing and toiletries.  The staff are friendly.  We were able to leave thec ar in the car park even after we’d checked out, which was nice.
 Only negative comment was when we were checking out they billed us for items which had been included in our package – breakfast and wine – even though the refunded these graciously, I hate having to deal with this.",4,2012,01,16
204,Excellent All Round,This hotel is perfectly located. The staff are so attentive. Breakfast was the best I've ever had. The beds are amazing. Such a gem..def use this hotel when in Dublin..peaceful..just perfect..,5,2012,01,15
204,A much better experience the second time,"We stayed here over the new year for 3 nights. The receptionists were friendly and helpful,the porters likewise,the room spacious and clean,plenty towels,slippers,soaps, face cloths,daily water,newspaper, nightly turn down and chocolates,good housekeeping,excellent breakfast,evening 3 course dinner the best in Dublin for value, quality and quantity, the head barman ' a native dub' should be cloned such was his care of duty to all customers and his friendliness (sadly a rarity today). The location is excellent,allowing both of us to do our own things safely. We thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our stay in this hotel  this time. We previously stayed in this hotel and we were not pleased but we are delighted to have given it a second chance, which we were hesitant to do.",5,2012,01,15
204,Great Hotel,"Have stayed in this hotel many times and this is my first time back after 5 years.  It has never disappointed.  Staff are always very friendly.  Rooms are of a high standard.  Will always choose this hotel when in Dublin.

204,"Location, location","I stayed here with my wife for our wedding anniversary in Nov 2011. 
Started with email contact with the reservations I believe his Will Woods was excellent and replied quickly and was one of the main reasons I booked the room.
When we arrived to check in we found to our surprise we had been upgraded to a room overlooking St Stephens Green. Four poster bed and seating area by the window it was great to be able to sit and watch people go about their daily business while relaxing.  It got a little loud at night due to the night club next door but my wife and I had no problems sleeping.
The bed was Huge and extremely comfortable and the room was extremely well furnished and a good size for a city centre hotel. 
There was nothing too much trouble for the staff from a last minute lunch recommendation to hot water issue(was not switched on resolved in a matter of mins) in the room everything was met with a friendly smile.
Had a drink in the bar.  Not much atmosphere but beacuase you are right at the top of Grafton street you are no more than a minutes walk from Bars and restaraunts and night clubs. 
It was great the next morning to have breakfast and go for a stroll down Grafton Street and St Stephen Green before going back to check out. 
1 thing parking 10 euros per day was a bit expensive should be included in the room also maybe a bettter check on people wandering in off the street going up to the rooms.  We were awoken by an extremely drunk couple we had seen earlier checking to see if any rooms were open. We had reported it to reception but they woke us over an hour later trying to get into our room.",4,2012,01,13
204,fantastic christmas,"We spent Christmas at the Fitzwilliam, and it was wonderful. Great room, lovely view over Saint Stephens green, and great atmosphere in the hotel. The staff were brilliant, the food was great, we really have no complaints.",5,2012,01,11
204,Ice Cold Night Staff.,"My partner and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel on the night of Monday 24 October.  Owing to the flooding, we were forced to stay in the city centre and chose this hotel on the basis of its reputation as a superior establishment.  I made a telephone enquiry in order to request a double room and was advised that there was availability for such a room.  Accordingly, we decided to stay at the hotel.

Upon arrival, I once again specified a double room.  We found the member of check in staff who dealt with us to be very cold and unhelpful when dealing with us; in fact, we were actually made stand to one side while other members of the public who came into reception after us were looked after.  This experience made us feel very unwelcome, almost to the point where we felt that we were imposing.

When we received our room keys, they would not work in the door of the room; when we went back to reception, we once again felt that we were an inconvenience to the staff member, who clearly assumed that we hadn't operated to door key properly and lightly chastised us for this.  The replacement keys that he supplied us with also did not work and we had to be given access to our room by another staff member.

When we accessed our room we discovered that we had been allocated a twin room, despite having specifically requested a double room on more than one occasion.  We decided not to complain to reception at the time as it was late at that stage and we just wanted to be able to relax.  I do however feel that, as we were clearly a same-sex couple, our request for a double room (which we knew to be available from our original request) was deliberately overlooked in favour of a twin room.

In addition, my partner, recently discharged following a stay in hospital, was clearly in some discomfort when checking in; we were disappointed that, despite the fact that this was obvious, we had to endure such an initial wait in favour of customers who came into the hotel after us and the subsequent confusion in relation to the room (taking out of the equation the fact that we were put in a different room to that which we paid for).  I would have expected a much greater level of sensitivity from a hotel of the calibre of the Fitzwilliam.

On a positive note, we found the room to be of a very high standard in terms of decor and comfort and once we managed to get the attitude of the staff who we had encountered out of our system we were able to relax.

Overall, we enjoyed the facilities provided, but the whole experience was seriously let down by the way we feel we were treated by the staff on duty that night - so much so, that given the choice, we would not choose to return to the hotel.  We had chosen to stay at the hotel on the back of its excellent reputation and felt very let down that paying customers should have such a poor experience of customer service.  We did not receive the room which we had paid for, were made feel as though we were an inconvenience and certainly felt that the fact that we were a same sex couple may have contributed to this.

All in all, we were very disappointed by the level of customer service shown to us throughout our stay.  We expected a standard of service from staff which we simply didn't receive, did not receive the room which we had paid for and felt totally unvalued as paying customers of the hotel.  The standard of the accommodation, a high point in our stay, simply could not compensate for the fact that we felt extremely poorly treated.",2,2012,01,10
204,Excellent hotel,We were there for a couple of days. The location is perfect. Everything is in walking distance. We got an upgrade. The room was very quiet on the 5th floor. Friendly service and staff. It was amazing to have dinner at the citron restaurant. New chef is top. We can highly recommend it. We would choose the same hotel next time in Dublin.,5,2012,01,10
204,Great Location,A bit disappointed to be rang 15 minutes after the hour to be asked if we were ready to leave....but all in all a lovely hotel with a great choice for breakfast and a brilliant location.,4,2012,01,10
204,Tiny room,"We booked a room with a balcony overlooking St Stephens Green,you had to open a window and use a small box to get out to the balcony,great view but would not suit a person with physical difficulties. The room itself was tiny no storage place,the bed was about a foot from the bathroom and the window. I had stayed in a cheaper room before which was much better. Overall great location,very friendly staff great breakfast,just a pity about the rooms.",4,2012,01,10
204,"Pretty good! Not amazing, but good.","I enjoyed my stay here, met some interesting people and slept well. The food was fine and there is not a whole lot more to say.",4,2012,01,09
204,Amazing hotel,"I stayed at this hotel while on a business trip to Dublin.

The location is excellent - right on St Stephen's Green and close to the main shopping street. There is no shortage of shops, bars and restaurants around. The river and Temple Bar area is only a 10 minute walk away.

The hotel staff were excellent. The receptionist was on the phone when I arrived, and thanked me for my patience while she finished the call.

The room was wonderful. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was amazing with the deepest bathtub I have ever soaked in. Total bliss. There was a flat-screen TV of a decent size in the room and a radio/CD player which was hooked up to speakers in the bathroom. Free wi-fi was available. There was a robe and slippers in the room to use. There was tea and coffee in the room too.

I loved this hotel, and I hope I get the opportunity to stay there again.",5,2012,01,04
204,Reasonably priced design hotel,"We stayed several nights in this beautiful design hotel just across the St. Stephen's Green park in Dublin. The location is great as the hotel lies just steps from the end of Dublin's best shopping street. Our room was impeccably clean, big and many beautiful details made it a pleasure to stay here. Lovely furniture, not so boring as normally in the hotels. 
We didn't try the restaurants as we prefer to have dinner outside the hotel and the breakfast was in our opinion quite expensive with 22 € per person. 
All in all, we enjoyed this hotel a lot!",5,2012,01,03
204,Christmas,We stayed at the Fizwilliam hotel on 24th December. The hotel is simply fantastic and the staff is nice and very professional. It was amazing waking up on Christmas day and have coffee overlooking St. Stephen's Green. We will definitely be back next year!!!!,5,2012,01,02
204,Excellent location and staff,"Just back from my second stay in this hotel. Location excellent for shopping (Top of Grafton St). There is valet parking-no charge for car park. Rooms are very clean and quiet.
Staff were most impressive on both occasions. Hard to describe but they seem to like working there and are really helpful and friendly, nothing is too much trouble,
breakfast is cooked to order and is very tasty. Restaurant staff were attentive without overdoing it. Excellent service really makes this hotel -management should be proud of them!",5,2011,12,30
204,Great location but Very Overpriced,"Ok you'd expect a 5 star hotel to be expensive but you'd also expect a 5 star service.
The service here is 4 star at best and disappoints on a number of levels.
The location however makes up for a lot of this with a whole host of restaurants, bars, shops and attractions right on the doorstep.",1,2011,12,30
204,"Christmas at Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin","What a wonderful Hotel,stayed for four nights over Christmas and I must say it was one of the most pleasant hotel stays I've had. The hotel and restaurant staff could not have been nicer or more helpful and added a personal touch that is sometimes missing in bigger hotels. Had a lovely surprise on Christmas Eve when I was given a lovely max benjamin gift wrapped candle and a personally addresses Christmas card  as a Christmas gift courtesy of the hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone intending to visit Dublin.",5,2011,12,29
204,"Tiny beds, but a great hotel if you're short","I would not stay here again at any price. However, and it's a big ""however"", if you are 5'10"" or under, and not too fat, you could well thoroughly enjoy your stay here and you would have a completely different experience to mine. (I am 6'0"" and 95kg, and my partner is much smaller!)

The beds are 200cm long and 150cm wide. The pillow is about 30cm deep, leaving a 6' guest with his feet right at the end of the bed.

Is this normal in Irish hotels? I'm Irish and never slept as an adult in a bed this short. My own bed at home in Asia is 212cm long - is that especially long?

I asked to be changed to a room with a bigger bed (and I specifically mentioned the bed was too short) and was changed to a slightly bigger room but still with a small bed. About the size of room and bed at somewhere like the Kowloon Hotel, Hong Kong, the smallest hotel room and bed I had ever seen until the Fitzwilliam. 

So the hotel completely fails for me because the bed is tiny! 

However, for those under six foot, the bed would be fine as long as you and the missus are on good terms.

The bar is modern and efficient, with excellent staff. A bottle of decent wine can be had for E43, which is not too bad. We had a good lunch and quite a few drinks throughout our stay. We weren't allowed to eat in the bar at all after 10:30, even if we ordered room service and brought it down. An odd rule worthy of Kafka himself. We could, for example, have taken our hotel food into the park and eaten it there, but not eaten it in the hotel itself. All we wanted to do was share a few slices of pata negra with our wine. Alas, no.

The staff are great. The location is great. They park your car for you. The hotel ticks a lot of boxes, except the Good Night's Sleep in a Comfortable Room box. The room was not exactly cozy either - not cold, but by no means warm. No slippers. The Carlton Airport Hotel has slippers, proper size beds, very warm rooms, and is less than half the price. I wish we hadn't moved!

I've lived in Asia for twelve out of the last twenty years and have stayed in a fair few hotels, mostly 4 and 5 star. I'm completely bemused at what to write about this hotel. This has never happened me before. It's like someone designed this great hotel, but for really small people. Surreal.",2,2011,12,22
204,Not a five star...,"We stayed here on a Saturday night as we had plans in the city, there were 3 of us in the room with one double and one put up bed in the room. The room was very very small ( I m not even sure how they managed to get the extra bed in)... Breakfast was "" buffet sytle"" and to be honest was nothing special... I've never had a buffet syle breakfast in a five star hotel before and I heard other guests also asking about this fact... The whole atmosphere and experience left us cold,there was nothing special or nice about our experience it was like any other run of the mill hotel except more expensive, we won't be returning and will stay in the other five stars near buy........",3,2011,12,19
204,Fabulous as ever,"The Fitzwilliam has it all location, superb bedrooms and friendly staff I would recommend this hotel highly and look forward to returning again.",5,2011,12,18
204,A real Christmas treat !,"My sisters and I took a room in the Fitwilliam as a well earned Christmas treat, and that is exactly what it was. I've got to say that as well as the great location, it is the friendly staff that makes this hotel stand head and shoulders above its neighbours. 
When we arrived and were going up to our room, struggling with our bags  we met a lovely young Irish waitress coming down from room service I guess. She shared our bags and helped us to our room and had a brief friendly chat, but refused any gratuity , laughing it off as being 5 mins away from the dining room. The room itself was awesome, luckily deep purple has always been a favourite colour of mine ! We had a lovely balcony over looking a peaceful garden area. 
In previous years we had eaten in the hotels restaurant but the quality of the  this year was vastly improved. We asked to be seated at a table served by the funny young waitress from earlier. She was a sweetheart, she advised us of the dishes,  fussed over us and generally made us feel special. As promised the meal was outstanding. We had a smashing time, although we may have drunk a little more than expected! I can absolutely say that our stay in the Fitzwilliam and the meal was the starting point of our Xmas. 
Unfortunately we never made it to breakfast  due to sore heads!
I can highly recommend this hotel, but it is the staff who made the whole experience better than its competitors!",5,2011,12,18
204,Like the Curate's Egg; good in parts,"I like the Fitzwilliam for it's location, quality and service but it doesn't mean that it doesn't frustrate me.  It serves truly the worst coffee I've ever tasted.  Even the staff go next door to get take-away.  In six years of staying here they've never managed to run an effective breakfast service, no personable welcome and food quality generally below the star-rating.  The basin taps in the bathrooms emit micro-jets of water that splatter everything within a metre radius and the temperature of the water in the shower is inconsistent.  The bed is also a little too firm for my liking.

All of that said, I still return every time.  I guess I'm addicted!  Great service from reception at check-in and check-out, in the bar and from room service.  Super food in the bar also.  The Fitzwilliam works.  I just wish it served decent coffee.",3,2011,12,17
204,Great Hotel,This was our second stay at the Fitzwiliam and again we had a lovely experience. Upon arrival we were given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room which is always a bonus. The concierge and  receptionist were very helpful and friendly. Our room was large and airy with a good size bathroom. Seeing as it is so central you are within walking distance of the main shopping area of Grafton Street and the St. Stephen's Green shopping centre. Hotel was warm and festive due to the season. Bar staff was friendly as was the restaurant staff where the food was absolutely excellent although the service was slightly slow. Will be looking forward to our next stay.,4,2011,12,15
204,Fantastic Location in the Heart of Dublin,"My husband, daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of December whilst over in Dublin for family celebrations. We arrived in our room to discover the third bed had not been put in for our daughter (aged 11) however this was soon sorted by house keeping. The beds themselves were extremely comfortable with crisp white linen and comfy pillows. We all slept really well due to such comfort ! Our room was also along the back of the hotel where the view wasn't great but more importantly, it was very quiet and peaceful. Facilities in the room were excellent however be warned not to take items out of the mini bar as you get charged even if you are just looking ! There is a warning sticker on the bar informing you of this though. The hairdryer was top notch, so no need to take your own. The bathroom was spotlessly clean with plenty of towels and beautiful toiletries. The shower over the bath was a powerful one, with plenty of hot water. The turn down service at night was a lovely luxury where we had chocolates left and the towels were changed again so we had fresh ones for morning.
Our only niggle was breakfast, hence why I have not given top ratings. On the friday morning when we ate, we were asked what cooked items we wanted. My daughter and I ordered the gorgeous full Irish breakfast whilst my husband had eggs benedict. All three dishes were served to us impeccably. Presentation was the best Ive ever seen for breakfast. There was plenty of juice, fresh fruit, cereal, continental goods, etc so all was great. Unfortunately Saturday and Sunday morning was a different story. It was all self service with lots of items running out (bacon, juice, cornflakes to name 3) and generally the restuarant was in a state of chaos. I accept weekends are always going to be busier with more guests staying but the problem seemed to occur due to the fact so many people had ordered breakfast in bed ! The poor staff were rushed off their feet trying to sort lazy guests out and simply didnt hae time to replenish food or take orders of hot drinks and toast for those of us who were in the restuarant. This situation appeared even worse after the marvellous experience we had our first morning.
The hotel staff in general are very helpful and pleasant. It is lovely and clean throughout and I will defintely stay here again. My advice to the management though, is limit the number of breakfast in bed requests as this really does seem to be making breakfast a very rushed and hurried affair for the rest of your guests. Location is great - right at the top of Grafton Street with great shops, bars and restuarants around. The Luas transport system has a stop right outside the hotel, taxis are EVERYWHERE and the air link coach dropped us at the other end of Grafton Street from Dublin Airport - a 5 min walk from there to the hotel. If you want a little bit of luxury then please dont hesitate to chose this lovely hotel, its not the cheapest, but its so worth it !",4,2011,12,14
204,"Convenient, comfortable hotel","Nice comfortable rooms, contemporary design. Great bathroom with good amenities and good size tub. Very helpful concierge service for giving directions etc. Did not use hotel restaurants, bar  or other amenities so cannot comment on these. Convenient location, esp for shopping, we walked almost everywhere. Would highly recommend this hotel for at pleasant week-end break.",4,2011,12,13
204,Excellent Hotel & Great Service,"Stayed at the Firzwilliam for 2 nights last weekend and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value, high end hotel in a great location.

Our flight landed at 8am on the Friday.  We expected check in to the be normal 2pm or 3pm so went to the hotel at 9.30am to drop of our bags before killing some time before we could check in.  When we arrived, without prompting the reception guy said that our room wasn't ready but he could upgrade us to another room and check us in straight away.  We were tired from having to get up at 4.30am so this was really appreciated.

All the staff were very friendly, helpful and customer focussed - nothing was too much trouble for anyone we dealt with so they must have great management.  The hotel itself and our room was also first class.  I will definately stay here again when I return to Dublin.",5,2011,12,13
204,Always great stay in Central Dublin,"I stayed here the second time for business and would always come back. Good value, great rooms, great beds, good sleep, friendly staff and very handy location for city centre. Only downside is the slightly small breakfast offer. I would expect more at this level. Hopefully this is something the hotel can improve on by the time I come back! ;-)",5,2011,12,11
204,Ger's Anniversary,I stayed on Dec 1st to celebrate my wedding anniversary & do some shopping on Grafton Street on Dec 2nd.   Great night.   Hotel staff are so customer focused. Room was lovely. Window seat a delight.   Purple theme is warm and welcoming and surprisingly good with the Christmas Tree.  Will be making this an annual event to kick start the Christmas spirit.,5,2011,12,05
204,Great spot.......feel special,"Stayed here with wife for just two nights to experience our first visit to Dublin after exploring the west coast a few weeks ago. Hotel is excellent. we were upgraded to a nice room (204) overlooking the green. Room was excellent with superb toilertries, dressing gowns, slippers and the most comfy bed ever. Slept superbly. Hotel is right in the thick of the action, with the shops of Grafton street 60 seconds away. It is a bit disturbing to be hounded by beggars on every corner and the homeless situation seems rife in Dublin. When you are staying in 5 star opulence, it does make you think but then we thought, well we work hard, lets enjoy!! Hotel bar is good but, to be honest, if you want a quiet, upmarket drink in upmarket surroundings, walk 5 mins up the road to The Shelbourne hotel. Great bar but not cheap, but pure luxury.

For day out, get bus pass via hotel reception and get a euro discount. 15 euros gets you a hop on hop off bus pass for 48 hours. The bus covers 23 stops around the city centre and beyond, covering all the attractions. Much cheaper than getting taxi's. A visit to The Guinness store house is a must but we preferred the visit to Dublin jail. It is only 6 euro's and includes a one hour guided tour around the prison. Brilliant but harrowing. Our guide Shiobhan, was truly excellent. What else? Bewleys on Grafton street is fantastic for afternoon cake and drink and to shelter from the elements.

Also recommend a Friday night out at Harolds Cross Greyhound track. Great night out!

All in all then, The Fitzwilliam is superb, staff great, breakfast top quality with REAL orange juice with real bits in it! Keep up the high standards!",5,2011,12,04
204,Luxury Hotel in the Heart of Dublin,"This is a very well appointed hotel conveniently located next to Grafton Street for shopping and with many good restaurants within walking distance. The rooms were nicely done (I especially liked the window seat) beds were comfortable and the room facing the back of the hotel was quiet, even with the window open (not much of a view though - it just looked straight into someone's office). Breakfast was good but I'm not sure how they get away with charging 27 Euros if you want to order french toast....",4,2011,12,03
204,Location is great but overall it was a let down.,"Arrived on a Sunday afternoon,  Location couldn't be better for the city centre.  Check in was easy and welcoming.  Underground car parking is very easy to access at rear of the hotel.  Room 529 is 135 steps from the elevator & this was very frustrating.     The bed portion of the room was very cramped due to a ridiculous built in window seat which we didn't (couldn't) use and isn't necessary.  For our two nights stay, there was a fairly persistent odour of cigarette smoke in the room.  We are not sure where this came from but we guessed that it came from our chain smoking neighbours.  We didn't really blame the hotel for this but wondered if floor 5 is a smoking floor.   Bathroom very good with excellent bath and shower.  The room has usual hair drier, iron, clothes press, safe, tea/coffee making & a stocked fridge.  Small flatscreen TV has lots of channels but the reception is mediocre.    We overlooked the inner 'courtyard' and were afforded a nice quiet sleep because of this.
Dinner that evening in Citron was excellent value. 2 Courses @ €20 each was superb and the food and service was good and friendly.   Unfortunately, only two other tables were occupied which didn't help with the atmosphere, but that's hardly fault of the hotel.
Breakfast in Citron had a very good continental buffet but the cooked breakfast was awful.  Bacon tough, practically inedible. Asked for Tomato, cheese, mushroom omlette but was served it with ham, no mushrooms,and to add insult to injury, it was tasteless.  Coffee was very good.
Breakfast on day two was worse.  My cooked breakfast was forgotten about completely until I reminded them about it 10mins later.   They then began to cook it and it was nothing to write home about.    My wife chose not to have a cooked as she was so disappointed with it on the previous day. There are a number of items on the menu that require a supplemental payment.  Stupid.   Why do pancakes (flour, egg and milk) require a supplement?
Used the bar twice and service couldn't be faulted.  The bar decor however could be improved, it's a bit 'cold' and uninviting.
Check out was easy, the bill was very detailed and unambiguous, and a 12pm checkout time is very civilised.
The worst part of our stay was when we had lunch in the bar with two new friends.  Our chicken lunch was one of the worst lunches I have ever eaten.  Tasteless, beige coloured breast of chicken accompanied by potatoe and peas.   While eating it we were concerned that the chicken may not have been properly cooked, it looked so pale.   I am convinced it was microwaved.  Horrible, lazy offering from what is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.   It was embarrassing, as our dining partners were new to us and we wanted no awkwardness.
While reception staff were nice during our stay, I had one snooty encounter with a female receptionist when I politely asked her to validate my car park card after lunch.  (I had agreed this with her male colleague earlier in the day)  I have never been interrogated by the Gestapo,  but I expect her interrogation of me would come pretty close to it. 
After I returned home, I received an automated email from the Fitzwilliam saying ""We hope the smile we put on your face is still there...""  To be honest, we didn't smile an awful lot during our stay there and I believe there is better value elsewhere in Dublin city.
I would give Fitzwilliam 4.5 Star, not 5.",3,2011,12,03
204,five star staff,"I stayed here two weeks ago for a birthday treat, it was a lovely stay! Welcoming and luxurious stay. With a very different purple theme, that really looked brilliant.  Staff where the best me and my wife have come by in many years - specially in the 'Citron'. We slept in therefore missed breakfast but for dinner our waitress was a credit to the staff she beamed with pride and knowledge of the food ( amazing food experience by the way, small and delicate flavors ) we didn't get a chance to talk to many of the other staff as it was busy. But they all where pleasant in passing, also the manger was polite and welcoming. Both of them, ( John and Eibh ) made the night experience. Thank you to all your beautiful staff and for a brilliant stay. 

We will be back !",4,2011,12,01
204,"Very disappointing - cold rooms, noisy","I hadn't stayed here before and to be honest I never will again.

The staff in the hotel are really lovely and the location of the hotel is perfectly central but we were looking for a nice cosy hotel and this was very disappointing. 
Firstly, the room was freezing. The lighting in the rooms is also very poor, the bathroom is nice and large. 
There is no atmosphere in the dining room - it is decorated well but that's it.
As for the noise from the street!?!?!?!?!
Thanks but I will not be back",2,2011,11,30
204,Lovely hotel bit noisy staying in a room at front of hotel,"Stayed here one night 28th Nov, great location very close to Stephens Green shopping centre 2minutes to the top of Grafton st. Staff very friendly. Upgraded room on arrival. room with small balcony great view would be nice in the summer. Only thing very noisy outside during the night due to party goers hanging around opposite the hotel 2am in the morning this went on for a few hours (hotel really no control over this) so if you want a peaceful nights sleep don't take a room at the front.Rooms spotless quite small considering the price breakfast and service excellent",4,2011,11,29
204,Fabulous hotel,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Dublin.  The location is great and the hotel is top-notch.  A few of the things I loved:  the beds, the toiletries, the staff, the free apples, the breakfast, the turn-down service chocolates, and the decor.  I felt truly pampered and it was lovely.",5,2011,11,29
204,"Fabulous hotel - but hot, NOT green, and shoddy Wi Fi","Incredible service, great location, rooms fabulous. However, we could not turn down the scorching heat (we opened the window) and the Wi Fi shuts down regularly. 

Also, why is it necessary to change the soap and towels every day? Guests should be given a choice to go green, even if the hotel is not interested.",4,2011,11,29
204,The Best,I've stayed at this hotel in Jan 11 and April 11 for a week each and both times I had the best service and the staff is Excellent (Professional and Friendly). I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Dublin.,5,2011,11,28
204,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My husband and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam for two nights at the end of November. The location is tops right in the middle of city centre but from our room we could have been in the middle of the country as we didn't hear a thing (no traffic noise). Rooms are well laided out beds very comfy. On arrival our car was parked for us and cost of parking was only €10 per day which is very reasonably for city centre. Hotel is a little expensive but because of the location we did not have any taxi expenses so it probally worked out on a par with staying somewhere outside the city! All in all yes I will stay here again staff polite and helpfull but the big plus for me was location location!!!!!!,5,2011,11,27
204,grate place,"Its is a great place ,its a really nice place ,with really nice people looking after you what more could you ask for ??????? Well for me not a thing !

John Tighe",5,2011,11,23
204,"Great location, beautiful room, good food, friendly staff",We stayed at the Fitzwilliam last week for two nights and were more than pleased.  Would definitely go again.,5,2011,11,22
204,Business made pleasurable,"Everyone in Ireland was friendly, but the staff of the Fitzwillaim Hotel Dublin went above and beyond.  We originally had reserved one room for my business stay, but when my father became ill, it was necessary for me to bring my children to Ireland.  Despite the last minute decision, the staff at the Fitzwilliam's found adjoining accommodations. The concierge staff freely and graciously helped my kids find safe ways to enjoy their time in Ireland while I met my business obligations.  With their help,  my business trip became a outstanding family vacation.",5,2011,11,20
204,Luxury stay in Dublin city centre,"Couldn't fault my stay, the staff are beyond helpful and were very friendly. The room was superb, very spacious and comfortable. Just a pity I only stayed for one night!",5,2011,11,18
204,A fantastic hotel in a great location,"I stayed at the fitzwilliam for 2 nights. The hotel is in a great location, straight across from St Stephens Green at the top of Grafton Street. Almost everywhere is easily walkable from the hotel - a 10 - 15 minute walk to temple bar although there are nice restaurants and bars very close to the hotel if you don't want to go to temple bar area. 

The reception area of the hotel is lovely with a fire and comfy seating. The reception staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful, same goes for the concierge who offered to make restaurant reservations, get us taxis, and stored our bags for us after check out until we were ready to leave. 

The room we had was really nice with decent sized beds, and all the things you would expect - large tv, hairdryer, tea/coffee etc- plus lots of little touches such as a CD player, speakers in the bathroom, nice toiletries, fluffy dressing gowns and slippers. 

I would definately stay again - can't get a better location!",5,2011,11,16
204,"Very Nice hotel, would stay again, location overcame drawbacks","Overall, the Fitzwilliam Hotel is a nice property with an absolutely PERFECT location for just about anything you could do in Dublin.  
The Good:  The rooms are clean, the bed was comfortable, the tub was huge, and there are adundant towels and soaps for those packing light for the weekend.  Additionally, there is a CD player/MP 3 player with built in speakers in the wall and even a few candles with matches for those looking to have a romantic time.  There is also free wifi and internet.  
The Bad:  The sink didn't drain, the room was very small, and the breakfast at their restaurant Citron, was good, but for the money (22 Euros) I was suprised that we needed to flag down one of the frantic wait staff just to bring us some coffee. 
My wife and I would stay here again at a discounted rate.  It was overall a good experience.",4,2011,11,13
204,"Great location, excellent staff","Stayed one night only on a brief trip to Dublin, but really enjoyed my first visit to the Fitzwilliam.
Fantastic location right in the heart of Dublin, the modern hotel room was very comfortable,with great comfy bed, and everything you need - for example, a decent iron to press your shirt with !
I dined at the brasserie type restaurant and had the early evening set menu, which was really high quality and reasonably priced. Really pleasant and enthusiastic staff up there as well, added to the ambiance.
I left early in the morning, so no time for breakfast, but will certainly return.",4,2011,11,12
204,Reward Yourself,"If you are working hard, and making a difference, then reward yourself with a stay at the Fitzwilliam, rooms are not large but all the staff make the experience one to savour.  I have now used the hotel about 10 times and have never been treated like a stranger. Service is outstanding and courtesy is a religion with them.  Bedding and bathrooms of a high standard and the breakfasts are done to order.  Everyone deserves at least one night a month at the Fitzwilliam, just to remind yourself to take time for yourself.",5,2011,11,12
204,"Location, Decor, Food, Comfort - I will be back!","I joined my wife for the first night of her three night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin in November 2011. On parking outside the hotel a valet was on hand to take care of both the car and lugagae. Carparking rate of €10 per night is excellent for the area. The hotel is in an excellent location for any shopping or city sightseeing. On arrival in our room I was immediatley impressed with the decor and detail, granted the rooms are on a sligtly smaller scale considering the premium you are paying, but I would consider them perfectly formed and added to an air of warmth and comfort. The detail, colour scheme, soft furnishings etc where immpecable and within in moments you forget about the scale and make yourself at home. 

We had room service on the evening of our stay, prices where excellent for a 5 star hotel with main courses averaging around €12-€15. The presentation, portion size and qulaity of the food was excellent. As my wife was staying on for a few more days she has used the service again. 

The ensuite had a a very large size bath, with monsoon shower. The selection of products and details where again excellent. 

Overall I would highly recommending the hotel. Having stayed in a number of city centre locations this would be my number one choice going forward.",5,2011,11,08
204,Outstanding hotel and perfect location,"I have been working and travelling for over 13 years. I have paid a lot more money for other hotels, but the service at the Fitzwilliam out ranks any other hotel experience. I arrived before check in time. I was directed to the 'day room'. A room with all shower and change facilities. Only thing that could top it would have been a hair dryer, but it was a very nice option after a long flight. I went to the bar for a light lunch and when the bill came I explained that I had checked in but did not yet have a room to sign my bill against. The waitress came back moments later with my bill and my room key - I went to the reception afterwards to ask for my bags to be taken up and they said it had already been done. That typifies my experience at the Fitzwilliam. The decor in the room was just lovely, the bathroom divine, I felt as though i was staying in a grand mansion and not in a hotel room at all. Little touches made it so lovely - no need to insert a room key to have the power on, an umbrella hanging on the coat rack, a good iron board and hair dryer in the room, an option to utilize a range of CDs from the lending collection on the room stereo. Every single person I encountered was outstanding (the man who delivered the CDs at 3am was a little grumpy, but who wouldnt be!). The location was brilliant. I cannot reccomend the Fitwilliam highly enough.",5,2011,11,08
204,Great luxury hotel,"The location of the hotel could not be better - right on Dublin's main pedestrian mall, and overlooking a park. Robert, the head concierge, was extremely helpful in planning our 4-day stay in Dublin, and his tips were spot on. The Michelin-starred Thorntons Restaurant is exceptional. The breakfast service was good too. Room and bathroom - great too.",5,2011,11,07
204,Hotel,My boyfriend decided to whisk me away to dublin for the wknd. I was very excited and was even more so when he said we were staying in a 5 star hotel. We arrived at hotel and the staff parked our car. This was the main highlight. We arrived at our room and both of our heads fell to theground our back kitchen was bigger than this room it was so disappointing. I immediately got on the phone to reception and asked to be changed no such luck as the hotel was booked out. The next day we were moved to another room not much bigger. The shower wasn't great either. hot and cold. I wouldn't go back again. For the money spent very disappointing. Then when we were leaving we had to go to car prk and find car one would expect the car to be brought to door.,2,2011,11,07
204,"Excellent, as always","Another perfect stay at The Fitzwilliam.  The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and Mary and Roisin are a credit to the hotel.  The room was amazing, with balcony overlooking the beautiful St Stephen's Green.  You can't beat the location.  The food was beautiful (both evening and breakfast) - I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel without hesitation.  Thanks to all",5,2011,11,07
204,excellent stay.,wow what a find .gr8 location and couldnt fault the hotel - staff very helpful and friendly - would stay again.,5,2011,11,07
204,First rate service at Fitzwilliam,"We've just returned from an overnight at the Fitzwilliam and thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful. We had an excellent breakfast
The location on Stephen's Green was excellent and access is easy to all sights either by foot or public transport. The onsite car-park is also a bonus
We would plan to return",5,2011,11,06
204,The customer care at Fitzwilliam was top class,"Difficult to fault, the guest experience was clearly a priority for all staff at the hotel.  The room was modern, clean, very nicely furnished and decorated.  The vast King size bed was comfortable with lovely touches such as fresh flowers in the room.  Very good breakfast choice and service.  Friendly and good value for money.  Very close to the center of Dublin, lovely location just St Stephens Green.",5,2011,11,03
204,Excellent hotel with Michelin starred restaurant and great location,"My new husband and I recently spent 4 nights at this lovely hotel and really liked it. We had one of the basic rooms which was big and the bed really comfortable. We also ate in the Thornton Michelin starred restaurant and met Mr Kevin Thornton! Everyone was really friendly and I highly recommend it. 
The location is great. It's next to the St Stephen's park and the Hop On Hop Off Bus routes. If you want to go shopping then this is the place to be. It's also only a 10 min walk to Temple Bar which is great for Irish pubs and restaurants.",5,2011,11,01
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin,"Very nice lobby area all decorated for Halloween!....rooms quite small but modern....Our in room breakfast card in room stated breakfast finished at 11am but when we went down at 1045am apparently it has changed and is now 1030! Everything had been cleared away but they still let us in and provided food for us - may need to change the in room literature though!
Staff not over friendly and service could be better....
Overall probably the best hotel for location but there are better hotels in Dublin....",4,2011,11,01
204,Loved everything about this hotel.,"This hotel is in a great location, just off Grafton Street and in the heart of Dublin. You can walk to everything from here. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet.",5,2011,11,01
204,Room Cancellation,"I'll keep this short and sweet, we had booked into this hotel a number of weeks prior to our stay.  
They rang at 7.45pm on the evening we were due to stay (just as we were arriving into Dublin) to tell us they no longer had a room for us!  
They arranged alternative accommodation which we had to pay for and made the promise that the manager would contact us the following day (this never happened needless to say).
I just thought it was so rude and they clearly don't have any appreciation for their customers.  
Beware.",1,2011,11,01
204,Easily the best hotel in central dublin,"I've stayed in all the major hotels in dublin for business and pleasure. This hotel far and away exceeds its competitors. I've made a few complaints in the past which were dealt with very efficiently and to everyone's satisfaction.

Rooms are well appointed and the staff are excellent.Breakfast is served in a bright airy space. 

Hint :Rooms 308 and 309 can be effected by noise from a downstairs bar (Not The hotel's bar). If you area light sleeper you might avoid them.",5,2011,11,01
204,"Expensive, but great location","Have stayed at this hotel twice, the location is great, right on the edge of st stephens green, a 1 minute walk to grafton street and very central. it isnt cheap, the rooms are lovely, and the food is good, the staff were helpful, but a little off hand perhaps. Personally I think there are better hotels in Dublin!",4,2011,10,31
204,A fine hotel with a brilliant restaurant,"The Fitzwilliam is a well-managed property in an excellent location.  I thought the room was rather small, and very poorly lighted, though comfortable.  The bar is welcoming and the lobby attractive.  The highlight, though, is Thornton's restaurant, which may well be the best in Ireland.  It is elegant without being pretentious, and the food is truly imaginative and delicious.",4,2011,10,31
204,Ideal for shopping trip,We visited the Fitzwilliam on a couple of occasions mainly due to it's location on St Stephen's Green at the top of Grafton Street making it ideal for shopping.  There is also access to LUAS which takes you to Dundrum Shopping Centre and Henry St is only a short walk away.  The hotel itself is gorgeous and staff very attentive.  There is internet access and a business centre so it's easy to keep in touch.,5,2011,10,28
204,A great Dublin Experience!,"This was a fantastic choice of hotel! Rooms are great, lobby was very welcoming and easy to meet friends/family there, in front of a nice fire. Staff were the most efficient we have found anywhere, nothing was difficult! The location at the top of Grafton Street was superb. Easy to shop and there was a wide choice of restaurants very close by. The Citron restaurant within the hotel we also found to be excellent.",5,2011,10,27
204,Nice stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a couple of nights in late August whilst we were travelling around Ireland.

The hotel is an ideal location for exploring central Dublin on foot.  Situated at the top of Grafton Street near St Stephen's Green it is quiet whilst being adjacent to one of the main shopping streets.

The room was very nice and we appreciated the lack of noise through good double glazing.

The staff were very helpful, particularly the concierge staff.

Valet parking was useful.  The hotel may be difficult to locate if you arriving by car and are unfamiliar with Dublin.  A GPS solves the problem.

All in all a good experience.  We enjoyed our stay.",4,2011,10,26
204,Excellent location for business traveller or short-trips,"I travel quite frequently to Dublin, and used to look for a new hotel every visit. Since i have found this hotel, I look no further.... 

Location is excellent for business traveller, or anyone staying in only for couple of days. Park just next door, and the main shopping street opens just 50m from the hotel. 
Hotel facilities are very good to hold a meeting in hotel, even for bigger audience. Easy to access, given the traffic in Dublin, but walking distance all major business activities.

Plenty of restaurants, if you do not wish to try hotel's michelin star recommended restaurant. For more fun, Temple bar area is close-by.",4,2011,10,25
204,"Great location, great service, worth the price","I recently stayed at The Fitzwilliam for my last two nights in Dublin on a short trip to Ireland. This hotel is priced appropriately when you consider the prime location as well as the quality of hotel you are getting. 

My experience with the service, as well as the hotel itself was impeccable. I found the staff to be helpful, very courteous and willing to do whatever it took to make your stay a good one. Upon returning from seeing some sites late one evening, I asked the concierge how late the hotel bar was open. His response — ""For guests at this hotel, the bar is open."" He was basically saying, if you want the bar to be open, it's open. That's the level of service this place offers. Well worth the price if you ask me.",5,2011,10,24
204,Excellence in all categories.,"Again Tripadvisor to the rescue. Looking for hotel in central Dublin, with good review and found that it wasn't easy until we came across the Fitzwilliam.

+ location,
+ excellent service in all areas,
+ free wi-fi
+ super modern minimalistic decor room (315), modern and functional bathroom (careful hot and cold taps seem to be reversed to normal expectations)
+ room warm, bed very comfortable and overlooking internal court yard,
+ excellent room service/attention to detail,
+ attentive, friendly and very helpful conceirge,
+ excellent breakfast options, efficent and freindly wait staff,

204,Welcome to Dublin!,"Lovely hotel. Great location on St Stephens Green. Rooms are small but beautifully appointed; our second floor room overlooked an outdoor courtyard and was quiet and scenic. Staff are outstanding--welcoming, upbeat, and helpful. You will know instantly that you've come to the right hotel in the right city in the right country. I would love to return to the Fitzwilliam and Dublin.",5,2011,10,18
204,"My experience of the Fitzwilliam hotel,Dublin.","Myself and my husband stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel for  our wedding anniversary, the hotel had the room prepared with a scrumptious desert and complimentary cocktail, we were treated very well and the staff are friendly and willing to help in any way they could, the hotel is very clean and the food was done to perfection. The hotel is ideal for shopping as it is very central, all major shops are walking distance.",4,2011,10,18
204,Very personable service,"Almost immediately after my arrival, people started addressing me by my last name.  I do not know how this information was communicated so quickly, but it is a very welcoming touch.  Every thing was just perfect for my needs, and the hotel was in a great location in a very quiet area.",5,2011,10,17
204,better than expected!,"Stayed here for a week with my husband and our 9 month old son. My husband is Irish living in Canada and I'm Canadian. The hotel staff were very attentive and fun. The hotel was very posh without the attitude. Room was beautiful, clean and comfortable. The tub was great! Ordered room service twice and the food was very tasty. Steps to Grafton street and right next door to a small shopping centre. Walking distace from everything but in a nicer area than Temple bar thank goodness! We were happy we avoided all the noise of college students at the clubs.

Every concierge at the hotel was helpful and social but Tony and Viktor ere particularly amazing! They were full of information and were gret with our little one! They played with him, talked to him while we waited in the lobby and made him laugh everyday on our way out. (If management sees this those men need a raise!)
Would highly recommend this hotel and hope to visit it again soon!",5,2011,10,14
204,Loved it!,"Stayed here 2 nights - we were in superior room and our friends in the deluxe. Both rooms were wonderful. Beautifully adorned, great bathtub, lovely view. Quiet and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Terrific location.",5,2011,10,12
204,Great Location,"Stayed here for two nights while in Dublin. It is right in the city centre directly across from St. Stephen's Green. We got a room overlooking the park that had a nice balcony. The decor is modern but warm. Our room was quite spacious with a large, comfortable bed. The shower was powerful, which is an essential! We got breakfast delivered to our room which was OK, nothing to shout about but similarly there was nothing wrong with it. the staff are friendly and helpful with regards recommendations, directions etc. Would stay here again.",5,2011,10,12
204,Not a 5 star hotel.,"Claustrophobic! Room was very small and we actually had an upgrade from executive to Signature Queen suite so I can't imagine the exec room. Hairdryer very weak. No non steam mirrors in bathroom, fan and stereo wouldn't work in the bathroom either. Also the bed was AWFUL!!! Hard and lumpy and extremely uncomfortable. The mattress hasn't been changed since the place opened I think. The bounce and softness has been completely worn out of it and when you get up and sit on the edge of it the inside bar sticks in to your leg so sore because it's so worn. The pillows weren't good either. 

The only hotel toilets are down in the basement beside car park, through doors and corridors and stairs and the lift. Disappointed as the 5 star luxury you would expect is just not there. 

The main bar is dated and ugly. The brass strip around the bar is battered and scratched. No nice lighting and ambiance - it just doesn't exist. Food is good in the Citron and the staff are great but it looks like a factory canteen. We weren't given the option of eating in Thorntons and because we wanted something very special we would have liked to have been informed about Thorntons on our arrival or explained the difference in the two places, not just sent to  The Citron. 

HUGE downfall is that there is no pool or jacuzzi. It's a bit of an embarrassment for Ireland really that people are coming from all over the world expecting 5 star luxury - they won't get it at The Fitzwilliam. Where do these places get their 5 stars from???? Ireland's standard of 5 star is WAAAAY behind the rest of the world. Rip off Ireland still exists it seems. 

Won't be back until it's been completely renovated. A candle, a couple of chocolates and fresh flowers does NOT a 5 star hotel make.",2,2011,10,11
204,Great Location and Service,I would definitely recommend staying here. On our cab ride from the airport our cab driver told us that we made an excellent choice. Pros:  Excellent location; very friendly and helpful staff; very clean and modern room; and onsite restaurants.  It's hard to come up with any cons but the room was kind of small compared to US hotels (but similar to other European hotels where I've stayed) and there wasn't an exhaust fan in the bathroom. These two minor things won't stop me from staying here on my next trip to Dublin.,5,2011,10,10
204,Very close to perfect,"We came to Dublin after staying at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast. We were not disappointed by the sister hotel in Dublin. Right in the heart of the city, steps away from Grafton Street yet insulated from the hustle and bustle of the city, the Fitzwilliam Hotel gets it right. The lobby is comfortable though small and facing St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin’s version of Central Park. The staff is very attentive and extremely competent (umbrellas appeared out of nowhere when it started to rain as we waited for a taxi outside the hotel door). The rooms are small, but very comfortable and well appointed so you don’t feel cramped, with live orchids in the sitting area and fresh flowers in the bathrooms. They offer free in the room wifi as they do at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast. If I was pressed to find anything wrong with this place I could complain about the awkward showerhead faucet in the bathroom sink which splatters water everywhere when you try to use it, but that would be me been picky. Great hotel.",4,2011,10,07
204,Excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin!,"When we arrived around 11 am, our room wasn't ready yet, but we left our luggage with the friendly receptionist who would call us on our cellphone when the room was ready. And indeed, after 1 hour when we were exploring the city we received a phonecall that our room was ready. Luggage has been brought to the room already, so all we had to do was take the keycard and go up to the 5th floor.
Our room was spacious, clean and very welcoming, the use of colours gave the room a nice atmosphere. We also had also had a balcony overlooking St. Stephens Green.

The hotel has everything you'd expect in a 5 star hotel: clean rooms, a good bed, all business facilities needed (handy when you want to do your online check-in for the return flight: there's a computer with printer downstairs), good restaurants/breakfast facilities...but the real treasure of this hotel is the staff: they make you feel welcome, , treat you as you were the only customer there, are friendly and easy approachable, they never give the impression that what you ask is too much. 

It's obvious that they are the 5th star of this hotel :-)",5,2011,10,06
204,Courteous Cozy Stay in the Heart of the City,"I stayed there for 10 days while my son got settled to start college. We were always greeted warmly, offered help, and felt welcome.  The staff is extremely friendly, the service wonderful. The hotel colors give a sense of coziness and warmth, rooms are clean and quiet, yet the location is central to everything. We dined at the restaurant once, the meal was delicious and the service was great.  They offer turn-down service every evening and leave good quality chocolate by the bed :-)",5,2011,10,05
204,5 out of 5,"Great location, very helpful staff, and excellent food at bar and restaurant.",5,2011,10,05
204,A weekend in the Fitzwilliam,"We arrived in torrential rain and the car was parked for us by the conceirge. I'm very fussy about how and where my car is parked and when I checked later it was excellent. The food in the bar in the evening and the breakfast in the mornings was excellent. The facilities in the room were everything one would expect of a hotel of this standard, especially the bed which was very comfortable.  The location right beside St Stephen's Green was brilliant and allowed easy access to the main shopping areas. The staff were very helpful and friendly. 
Even though it rained all day Saturday, the hotel made our trip very enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!!",5,2011,10,04
204,Comfortable and a great location,"I really loved this hotel which i have now used twice for business trips. It is clean and well fitted, very nice staff, good rooms which are well equipped and quiet, excellent bathrooms and the food in the restaurant was really excellent. I could well imagine using the hotel for a nice stay as a couple too - it is St Stephens Green so the best location really, but it seriously works well as a business hotel.",4,2011,10,03
204,Very Good!,"Very nice hotel, excellent location. Nice envirionment.",4,2011,10,03
204,Heaven,booked this hotel for a birthday treat for a friend.  Staff were lovely.  The room overlooked St. Stephen's Green and was pure luxury.  The breakfast was to die for! All in all a fabulous stay!,5,2011,09,30
204,Way Over Priced,"I booked the Fitzwilliam because of its central location and wanted a nice place for the first leg of our Ireland trip as it was my partner's birthday.  On the plus side:  It is central and convenient to everything in Dublin.  We asked for and got a quiet room.  The house keeping staff did a great job and were never intrusive.  On the Negative side:  The room needs renovation, with nasty grout in the bathroom, worn carpet, light fixtures half out of the ceiling.  The bed was two of the hardest doubles squished together, a fitted sheet and a duvet cover, that is it!  The concierge was less than helpful and often rude.  The hotel has No services like a pool or steam room.  No View of St Stephen's Green.  

I would not have minded the negatives so much but for the outrageous price we were charged.  Of the places we stayed in Ireland this was by far the least value.  On our last day at the Fitzwilliam my partner asked why I didn't book the Radisson around the corner and he did not even know how much I paid for his ""birthday stay"".  Still makes me cry.",2,2011,09,28
204,Wonderful hotel experience,Spent first night of an Ireland vacation in Dublin at the Fitzwilliam.  It is a nice quaint hotel in an excellent location.  I would highly recommend to anyone who is staying in Dublin one night or several nights.  They have a nice buffet in the mornings with a great variety of breakfast foods.,5,2011,09,27
204,Memorable Stay at Fitzwilliam,"My recent 10 day stay at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin for business purposes was an outstanding experience. The ""atmosphere"" of the hotel is mellow and low tone and the staff from the second that you appear at their doors are welcoming, and friendly in the Irish tradition. My numerous technical requests from arranging for impossible to get tickets to a sporting event to arranging tea in a lobby nook, or conference telephone hardware in my room, were met quickly and correctly. A genuine 5 star experience. Made me feel like part of the family.",5,2011,09,26
204,Excellent hotel and location,My Husband and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam last week for a couple of nights.  It is a fantastic hotel and the location is equally as good.  Have been reccomending it to my friends and family.,5,2011,09,25
204,perfect stay,I enjoyed a three days weekend in this amazing and beautiful hotel: the friendly staff has made our stay perfect!!!,5,2011,09,25
204,3rd Stay at The Fitzwilliam,"Stayed here for the 3rd time in August for 2 nights. Perfect location for Dublin, on St.Stephens Green & near Grafton Street. The Luas stops outside which will take you to South Dublin & Dundrum Shopping Centre. I got an upgrade from a Superior to a Deluxe room without asking, just mentioned to reception that my room was very small & was moved immediately after already allowing me a very early check in. Superior & Deluxe rooms overlook St. Stephens Green, Executive rooms are at the back of the hotel & face a roof garden.The decor in the rooms is very contemporary, lovely bathrooms & the best toiletries ever, H2O Spa! The only thing I didn't like was the big gold mirror that didn't match anything in the room & was hung at a height too high if you wanted to sit down, dry your hair or do your make up - these mirrors serve no purpose and are an eyesore! I ate at the hotel both nights, couldn't fault the food or service. Although this isn't the best 5* hotel that I've stayed in I'd still recommend it and it's my first choice in Dublin.",5,2011,09,24
204,Warm and Inviting Hospitality,"We Just came back from staying at The Fitzwilliam for 6 nights. It's a lovely hotel with a warm, friendly and quite exceptional staff. The hotel is immaculate. The rooms are fresh and clean and very inviting. We slept in comfort with wonderful pillows and soft bedding. We were on the 5th floor, tucked away in a quiet spot. No noise at all. Breakfast was delicious, especially the banana pancakes! The location is at the end of Grafton Street across from St. Stephen's Green. Lots of restaurants and wonderful shopping right at your doorstep.",5,2011,09,22
204,"Very Nice Hotel, Excellent Location","My family and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in 2 rooms for 3 nights in early September. The location of the hotel couldn't be better...right at the tip of Grafton Street and across the street from St. Stephens Green. Almost everything was within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly and provided excellent recommendations of places to eat/pubs in the city. The breakfast in the hotel was half buffet/half made to order, and was better than expected. 

Both rooms were very clean and big enough to accommodate everyone. The beds were extremely comfortable and helped us overcome our jet lag. 

Both of our rooms were on the second floor and one overlooked the courtyard area and one overlooked the park. While the room that overlooked the park had a better view, there were some issues with the noise coming from the nearby nightclub. This would probably be my only complaint about the hotel. 

When we return to Dublin, we will definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel again. The location and service are hard to beat.",5,2011,09,21
204,"Good Hotel, but not a 5 Star,","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for the first 3 nights of out trip to Ireland.  It was a lovely hotel, with good service, good rooms, nice decor and a perfect location.  We did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on that.  I did however fell the hotles 5 star rating is overrated.  It is for sure a solid 4 star hotel, but has nothing special to make it 5 stars.  It is just good.  The best part of the hotel is its location,right across from St. Stephens Green Park, next to Grafton Street where all the great shopping is and a 10 minute walk from Saint Patrick's Cathedral.  You will not find a better located hotel in the city, but everything else was just good.  You can walk to most of the best attractions within 10-15 minutes.  My best advice for a stay in Dublin is to catch the Air Coach from the Airport in and then back to the Airport, it is only 7 Euros per person and the best deal in town.  They have an area below the bus to store luggage and this is much cheaper than a cab as our cab in was 24 Euro, which is about 37 dollars!!  And don't plan to find budget food in Dublin, it does not really exist, though the local pub food is amazing and the Irish like to party late, so a lot of places are still going at 5-6 in the morning!!  The hotel also has free wi-fi and a Busines center with 2 computeres with free internet access.",4,2011,09,20
204,Great Hotel,"i visited the Fitzwilliam Hotel in February 2011 - the hotel, rooms, facilities were all very good. The location is very central and easy for all the tourist spots of Dublin. Only thing to be wary of is ordering a taxi from the airport (11miles approx) through the hotel - this was 90 Euro each way, whereas a normal taxi from the airport would have been a third of the price. But thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel, breakfast and bar snacks and staff excellent",5,2011,09,20
204,Very nice hotel for a business trip!,"I have stayed at the Fitz on numerous occasions for business and have found it to be one of the best hotels in Dublin.

The hotel is positioned in the centre of Dublin with very good transport links (Tram station right outside).

The hotel is maintained to a very high standard, the staff are all very helpful and the food is actually very nice indeed!

Bar service is also very quick and the mojitos are great!",5,2011,09,20
204,Fitzwilliams was a perfect fit for a perfect weekend in Dublin,"This 5 Star luxury hotel was exquisite in all aspects of my stay.

Wonderful location - Right next to the beautiful St. Stephens Green, at the bottom of the very lively Grafton Street.

Accommodations were tastefully decorated, comfortable beds/furniture, nicely sized and very quiet.  

I loved the breakfast! - The chefs gladly cooked to my requests even off menu/buffet choices. We enjoyed a scrumptiously special champagne brunch for The Royal Wedding!

The staff was so accommodating and went out of its way to ensure my stay was perfect from providing me with extra linens, having my room cleaned early to securing tickets at the last minute for events.

The Fitzwilliam was a perfect fit.",5,2011,09,16
204,Stylish hotel in the middle of everything,"Just checked out this morning.  Ideal location for walking to the sights and there is a tram stop right outside.  Nice touches, such as candles, orchid, turn down, and tea/coffee (instant) in the room.  The beds were really comfortable.  The room and bath were clean.  Bath products are H20 from Chicago.  The lobby has a fireplace and couches for lounging.  Overall a comfortable, convenient stay.  Note:  the noise from neighbors can be somewhat disruptive- the room doors close loud and hard, creating a ""bang"".  If you stay, catch your door, please!",4,2011,09,16
204,comfortable beds,"we stayed two nights.  the location could not be better.  we had a quiet room on the courtyard so no view, but really quiet.  extremely comfortable beds.  amzingly helpful concierge and door staff.  Chocolate on the pillow at night.  but a martini cost 12 euros.  we went to the bar immediately next door for better martinin prices.",5,2011,09,15
204,The hotel that really cares!,"The hotel is pretty, in a great location and offers everything you will need.  What makes this hotel stand out is the people who work there.  They are constantly there for you without being scarey.  Knowledge, friendliness and the ability to anticipate your needs is a great quality for a hotel to achieve.  Would stay there again.",5,2011,09,14
204,Great Location in Dublin,"We spent three nights in the Fitzwilliam while touring Dublin with friends.  It is in a great location with transportation hubs very near. We were ably assisted by our young but knowledgeable concierge, Anthony, who guided us to the hotel when we were confused by the maze of one way streets.  His advice on restaurants and venues was spot on and enabled us to make the most of our time. The hotel rooms are neat and functional with all the amenities one would expect from a top notch hotel. The only minor negative was that the steam table food on the breakfast buffet was stale the morning we sampled the buffet. Management apologized and removed the buffet charge when we mentioned the problem. We give this hotel our unqualified recommendation.",5,2011,09,13
204,one word- POSH!,"We spent our first night in Ireland here, and we were so impressed with the room. We had travelled for almost 10 hours, and we were more than ready to relax for a little bit before going out to see Dublin. We arrived to the hotel at noon, and sadly, they could not check us in until 2pm, which was not what we wanted to hear, but they were at least kind enough to hold our bags. Once we finally got up to the room we were blown away- what attention to detail! the bed was so soft and comfy, and the TV offered more channels than any other hotel in Ireland that we stayed at. I know it's not about watching TV, but after a long day it is nice to relax and not have to think too much!  The bathroom was my favorite part of the room- the tub was made for a good soak!!       As the other reviews said, the location was also perfect- so close to everything! And the staff was very helpful and friendly as well!  overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Dublin!",4,2011,09,12
204,great !,"really good hotel and thought the food was fantastic !
i will come back and stay there again !
great hotel ! 10 out of 10 for me .",5,2011,09,11
204,"Great location, pity about the price","We did not stay here but we had lunch in the bar.  Food was only ok for the price you pay but I have to say the staff are amazing and so attentive and well trained.  Big reason as to why we will not be returning here any time so is that they charge an ENORMOUS price for internett access which one does not ex[ect to pay for in this day.  Other hotels around the city, the wifi is free so dont see the reason behind charging guets for wifi when other places do not and only welcome our business.",3,2011,09,11
204,evening meals in this hotel is an upsetting experience,"The ageing porter was excellent in settling us in and making us familiar with room and hotel facilities, we had sandwich etc in bar which was perfect, we decided to eat in bar for nightime I had a starter which I got after 50 mins we got our main course after another 25 mins our waiter said they were short of staff on this monday when we complained so we decided to chance it again the next night which was not much better,
one kitchen serves bar and upstairs, my wife picked chicken from bar menu to have upstairs as nothing on upstairs suited her,this request was refused as house rules did not allow this we were informed so we had to go down stairs where I could not have my steak so I had fish instead,we were willing to pay price of food on menu from the one kitchen where ever we eat it but we were not faciliated,this treatment to customers in a 5star hotel is totally unacceptable and we have never seenit before,we had breakfast 3 morningsand one was cold the other two were excellent, their needs to be a change in restaurant management here, we were forced to leave this hotel to eat our evening meal owing to total incompotence,small wonder hotels loose business other than this service problem this is a good hotel but I have to give it a poor rating.",2,2011,09,10
204,The place to stay on the green,"What to say I just love this hotel,this is by far the best hotel on stephens green,if you fancy cocktails turn left at the shopping centre 100yards a bar called Harriys on the green you can't go wrong with this place.",4,2011,09,09
204,"Pecfectly good, but lacking that extra special feeling","This is a perfectly straight down the line solid hotel. Its styling is a little dated I think, but it's comfortable, clean, very conveniently located for the main shopping area, bars etc and the staff I encountered were always smiling, keen and happy to help. A disappointment I felt was the mezzanine breakfast area. They could barely seat everyone, it felt cramped and was very plastic feeling and soul-less. The buffet looked a little tired. And the cooked breakfast itself, at 22 euro was also disappointing - for a 5 star hotel, how much trouble would it be to source a decent sausage, and freshly brew some coffee? So, whilst there was nothing wrong with this place, and I slept extremely comfortably, it lacked something.",4,2011,09,09
204,Quality,In a great location on St. Stephens Green at the top of Grafton street it was really great.,5,2011,09,08
204,Fair to Good,"I had wished this hotel was better. although it wasn't bad it just could have been much better.  Basically for me it comes down to specific pros and cons for this hotel.
Pros #1 Location- it is perfect if you are just visiting Dublin and want to explore the city.
the beautiful park right across the street and the shops, bars, restaurants etc. all right there.
         #2 Room was nice, comfy bed and linens, adequate space, good products, loved the stereo and the speakers in the bathroom, AC worked good, clean, made good coffee every a.m., clean etc.
     #3 the one meal we ate was at the bar for lunch and it was good.
Cons- #1 I woke up every night at about 2 a.m.from the club downstairs base just pounding away, and we were on the 3rd floor facing the street--- we were only there mid wk so can't imagine what a wknd would be like.
#2  We are pretty independent people and don't need to be fussed over but I found the staff really mediocre at best.  The front desk girl showed us to our room which was a nice touch but after that the good service ended.  Even she said she was going to call us back and let us know if breakfast was included in our rate..but she never did.  No biggie, but the rest of the time although there was door men, no one ever opened a door for us or even said hello.  Kind of cold..maybe that's the Irish city people but after coming from Scotland where the people where overly concerned this just felt much different.

#3 the shower was a little awkward size door didn't shut properly  But the scariest thing was we kept hearing bubbling in the bathroom coming out of the shower drain when other people in other rooms used the toilet...a little concerning.

When we go back in November probably try the Shelbourne",3,2011,09,08
204,so go we went back,"Spent 4 nights  at the Fitzwilliam  beginning of August and at the end of August . The hotel has the best location in Dublin , walking distances to everywhere. rooms are spacious comfortable  nothing to complain.
And also the concierges each one of them were very hellpful , kind and warm.
If we go back to Dublin , we stay there again.
Francoise Strauss Arizona",4,2011,09,08
204,Amazing hotel for my honeymoon,We arrived at the hotel after a long day of driving and my wife and I just felt instantly relaxed when we walked into the lobby. Check in was a breeze. The women at the front desk was very helpful with all the questions we threw at her. We inquired about getting a massage and within an hour we had everything booked for the next day. The bar restaurant Inn on the Green was great. We ate there more than anywhere else in Dublin. I also can't say how comfortable the bed was. One of the best we sleep in on our honeymoon. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a hotel with comfy beds and tasty food.,5,2011,09,06
204,Ideal location and ask for balcony room for a great view!,"VERY centrally located near the tourist sights of Dublin and about a block from the  hop on hop off bus that goes to most everything.  The shopping is just a block away and parks. And I walked to 3 museums, the university and restaurants, (my fav. was sitting outside at Fire) too.  The staff was very pleasant, especially the conceirge!  I chose the smaller room over the larger rooms, because on the top floors, you could step out the window onto a roof/ balcony where we enjoyed room service breakfast every day and some evenings overlooking Dublin and ST. Stephen's square. (see photos attached) Each day the local artists displayed their paintings along the outer walls of the square that was fun to look at, but don't wait until the end of your last day to do it if you want to mail it home!  The balcony was like an extension of our room and had a table and 2 chairs. The room even supplies  an umbrella for a rainy day!  Yes it was tight in there, but very nice and it seemed to have been remodeled recently. Wonderful electronics and we could even enjoy the music on our balcony.  I thought she said if we wanted a king size bed we had to go with a larger room without a balcony, but I could have sworn we had a king size bed in our balcony room that was VERY comfortable!  We could hear the people in the hall sometimes, but it didn't seem to be an issue for us. I enjoyed a crunchy, juicy apple a day from the fruit basket on our floor near the elevator. The hotel is contemporarily decorated.",5,2011,09,06
204,Not as I hoped,"Small room, small 4' 6"" bed, no comfortable chair(s), but lovely bathroom.  Charged for car parking.  Breakfast was tasty but the mezzanine where it is served is quite small and you could be waiting for a table.  I can't understand the 5 star reputation.  Disapointed.",3,2011,09,06
204,3rd Trip to Dublin! Our New Home Whenever We Return!!,"My husband and I booked 3 rooms at the Fitzwilliam for 5 nights with our adult daughters and the men in their lives.  We absolutely loved everything about it!  The rooms were great. the beds were great, the location was great, and every employee was wonderful!  It was right across the street from St Stephen's Green, around the corner from Grafton Street and close to Trinity College, Temple Bar and many pubs.  What else could one ask for?",5,2011,09,05
204,Great service in central Dublin!,"Spent four lovely days in Dublin at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The hotel is lovely, the rooms beautiful and the location perfect for sightseeing. Located at one end of Grafton Street across from St. Stephens Square, it offers easy access to sites and serenity!  Most importantly, the staff, especially the concierges, were amazing! They helped us choose places to dine, sights to see and helped up with every issue that came up. When we had difficulty reaching family outside of Dublin, the person at the front desk even placed the call for us without charge! Everyone was friendly and helpful! We loved it!",5,2011,09,05
204,OK - but lacks the service polish of a proper 5 star,"We arrived on 31 Aug for 3 days and had chosen this hotel for location and on fairly good reviews. Location at the top of Grafton Street (the main shopping hub) is excellent. It's a modern style hotel, pools of light and so on, but the place struggled to get us excited in any real way. The rooms were a fair size and niceley decorated. Free Broadband was a plus. Other than a few seats in the arrival area (struggling to describe it as anything else) there were no public rooms. The non-room space in the hotel is largely given over to restaurants/bars. The gym is miniscule with 3 cardio mechines and some dumbells - that's it. Breakfast was the biggest dissappointment though and was a service shambles each day - you got seated ok, but then pretty much forgotten about and we had to chase for coffees and toast and actually go up an pull one of the staff to take our order for cooked breakfast.  It would have been so much easier for the person seating you to ask if a) you wanted tea or coffee and b) if you wanted a cooked breakfast at all or were happy with the continental breakfast buffet.  Once ordered it was hit or miss whether it actually arrived at your table. Saturday to be fair, was a bit better given that breakfast was served in buffet style steamers and as such you didn't have to pull a waiter to take your order. Still waiting for that coffee though......Food quality though was good. Nice Hotel, but the staff in the breakfast hall need a wake up call or at least a bit of training/management. The Prices were about the same as other hotels in the town - all in all - the experience was ok - but just that and for the money I think we'd have to try somewhere else next time.",4,2011,09,05
204,Excellent Hotel and Location in Dublin,"We stayed 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam (2 nights on arrival and 1 night before we flew out) and truly enjoyed the stay.  The staff was excellent and offered advice, gave directions and generally improved our experience.  What really impressed us is that they accomodated our request for an early check-in, as our flight from the U.S. arrived around 7AM.  We got to the hotel at 9AM and checked in our bags,  went out to breakfast and checked into our room a little after 10AM,  so we could nap before heading out. They really went beyond the call of duty to find a room that had been cleaned and get us in there.  We ate in the pub one night and had a wonderful meal.  You can't beat the location as it's a short walk to Trinity College and a little longer walk to the Dublin Castle.  Being close to Grafton St was perfect - as it's pedestrian only with many street performers to enjoy.  There are excellent restaurants and pubs near Grafton St as well.  We also enjoyed walking in St Stephen's Green which is right accross the street from the hotel.  We'd definitely stay there again.  One word of advice - the hotel charges for calling card calls to America - so keep your calls short.",5,2011,09,01
204,Best and Cleanest Hotel in Ireland,"The Fitzwilliam met every one of our expectations and then went beyond that.  First they allowed us to check in very early (being from the States our flight landed at 6am) which was amazing.  Second, we could not believe the fantastic location.  It is right next to the green, the train, Grafton St, and don't forget O'Donoghues (just a 2 min walk).  The staff was outstanding to boot.  Lastly, but the very least, this hotel was spotless.  The effort and hard work that must go into making this hotel so gleaming and comfortable is fantastic.  We stayed for 4 nights and will stay there every time we return to Dublin.",5,2011,08,31
204,"Nice hotel, poor service","The hotel is well located on St Stephens Green - Interior is nicely decorated - room was reasonable size and well finished.

The service we received was prone to errors. Fine in an 80 Euro a night B&B, not fine in a 260 Euro a night premium hotel.

- Asked for non allergenic pillows. 2 were changed 2 not. Umm?
- When we checked in we went straight out again & asked for the bags to be put in the room. 4 hours later they were not. Why? ""They had been busy"".
- When we booked we asked for a reservation in the Michelin starred restaurant next door. When we went to have dinner - no reservation had been passed through. 
- Do not disturb sign ignored.",3,2011,08,30
204,"Lovely hotel, great location","We visited the Fitzwillaim for our 30th wedding anniversary, it was a last minute booking, so it was quite expensive. We had requested a quiet room, preferably overlooking St.Stephens green, the upgraded us to a room with a small terrace  with the requested view, fantastic.
The staff were really attentive and friendly, particularly the check-in and the restaurant. 
The only downsides, as the room had a terrace, it was rather small, but all things considered it was worth it to have the outside space. We were slightly disappointed with the breakfast, it was buffet style, and the containers that the food was kept in, seemed to ""steam"" the food somewhat, I much prefer a freshly cooked breakfast served to you.
My wife ordered the pancakes, which incurred a 5 euro surcharge, she said they were disgusting, undercooked, filled with over ripe banana.
All in all we really enjoyed our stay, pity about the breakfast though, we will be back !",5,2011,08,24
204,Friendly and welcoming,"Stayed 2 nights with family in a roomy Executive Twin share over looking Courtyard with waddling ducks. It's an easygoing and friendly hotel in a great spot. Opposite St Stephens Green, Trinity College at end of Grafton St shopping strip and sightseeing buses around the corner. Breakfast great, cocktails and tasty treats at the Inn on the Green bar. Staff make you feel welcome and relaxed.",4,2011,08,24
204,Doesn't Act Like a 5 Star At ALL,"My family and I booked three rooms at the Fitzwilliam.  We chose this hotel based on the reviews posted here, hoping we would have a pleasant experience.  This definitely was not the case.
  One of the rooms had a very disgusting sanitary issue on the bed, so my husband brought it to the attention of the front desk.  The staff was not only unapologetic,  they thought they were being extremely generous for not charging me for the coffee I had ordered.  Before I left, I had asked to speak to the manager about the issue and how we were treated, but he was unavailable.  I have called twice and left messages since  my return home, but no one has bothered to contact me.
This is not how guests should be treated at a 5 star hotel.  This would have never  happened at The Merrion or The Westbury.  Should you also find dirty beds in a 5 star hotel?  Very unacceptable!",1,2011,08,22
204,I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!,"This hotel is nice and clean with great service. It's also in a great location, right near lots of tourist spots in Dublin and right across the street from the Luas, so it's central to almost anything you'll do while you're there.",5,2011,08,22
204,"Very, very pleased with our hotel choice","The Fitzwilliam is a wonderful place to stay in Dublin. We loved the location-right off Grafton Street. Every employee we spoke to was helpful, polite, and very friendly.  Our room was atttractive and comfortable. Turn down service was a nice touch. 

I'd recommend this hotel to my friends and would definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam if we were lucky enough to return to Dublin.",5,2011,08,21
204,"Great Hotel, we will be back!","Great location, very friendly staff, unbelievable breakfast that is included. Make sure, that you will be on one of the upper levels, if you are noise sensitive. There is a dance place downstairs, that one can hear in the lower level rooms. We definitely would choose this hotel again.",4,2011,08,18
204,What a Great Hotel,"In these economically challenging times it was a fantastic  treat to stay at such a fantastic establishment.

204,You will be absolutely thrilled with this hotel!!!,The staff at the Fitzwilliam are fantastic! The service is phenomenal! The location is superb. I am visiting Ireland for the first time and I will always go back to the Fitzwilliam!,5,2011,08,15
204,Very clostaphobic hotel - Good location,"We stayed here for 2 nights and as it was our anniversary we decided to upgrade to the Superior rooms. It was a tiny room and felt a bit worn, it felt a more like a 3*, the whole hotel felt very clostaphobic. The street noise from the LUAS tram stop directly outside was annoying.
The best scam that I have ever come across is at checking out, they add a ""donation to AFRICA"" to your bill without even mentioning it. I queried a line on our bill that was described assomething like  ""cosmos"" and was told by the receptionist that its a donation to AFRICA that the hotel adds to all bills. She told me that if I didnt want to pay it she could make me up a new invoice.",3,2011,08,14
204,More a 4 star,Good sized room. Bathroom had broken sink tap which was disappointing. Room service forgot order and had to call to chase it up. In the end gave up as had to go out. Complained to management and response was excellent. The room service tray charge of 6 euros is ridiculous. Breakfast was decent however when busy service is slow and buffet area looks empty. Great location and would stay there again. ,4,2011,08,11
204,Our 3rd visit in a row,"We love the central location, perfect in every way, try getting a balcony on the 4th floor
overlooking St. Stephens Green, the 5th floor balcony can be a bit windy as it is more exposed than the 4th floor. Breakfast is good and plenty. Bedrooms are good, staff
helpful and friendly, we are going back again next year.",5,2011,08,09
204,Can't wait for summer 2012 to stay again!,"The hotel is perfectly situated next to St. Stephen's Green - and Grafton Street. But it is away from noise and commotion. The location is perfect. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are well appointed. And if you like lots of hot water with your shower you can't beat this hotel! The little extras including bottled water, fresh apples and comfy slippers all contributed to a grand stay. We would definitely return!",5,2011,08,09
204,we will return!!!!,location is excellent for both shopping and sight seeing. THE STAFF WERE AMAZING COULD NOT DO ENOUGH FOR US. The hotel is spotless and decor is lovely we will return,5,2011,08,09
204,Disappointing,Definitely not 5 star! Great location but lots of the luxuries associated with 5 star missing. Breakfast was a big let down. It was self service and order for certain items. It took 20 mins to serve me an omelette. As soon as you sat down ordered your tea/coffee and this was served accompanied with White bread toasted (no option provided). However i have stayed in their sister hotel in Belfast and they were far better! ,3,2011,08,08
204,Great location and service but...noisy,"Fitzwilliam Hotel is centrally located on St. Stephen's Green.  The concierge is knowledgeable and very helpful.  We had a lovely, king room overlooking the green and all was good until the disco, located on the ground level next to the hotel, began blasting music at 11pm.  The hotel literally vibrated from the bass until 2am.  When we inquired about the noise at the front desk the following morning, reception acknowledged that was a normal Friday night and warned us to expect the same on Saturday.",4,2011,08,08
204,Great Hotel,"We had a lovely nights stay in this hotel, the room was fabulous complete with iron, ironing board, wine glasses, mini bar, hairdryer and a deep bath for a lovely long soak. The bed was really comfy and the room was spacious. I'd definetely go back, we got a good deal on the room so watch out for deals as its a great hotel especially for the location, close to all shops and theatre and there are plenty of restaraunts nearby from low end to high end so the choice is there. Reception was very efficient and helpful, overall and nice free,easy and relaxed atmosphere.",5,2011,08,08
204,"Swanky, fun place with great location","We stayed at the Fitz for one night in Dublin.  First off, location is perfect.  Right next to plenty of pubs, restaurants, shopping, right on St. Stephens Green next to Grafton street.  Staff was super friendly, especially the concierge Anthony.  Overall, little pricey, but worth the money if you are looking for a nice place to stay.",5,2011,08,07
204,"Great location, great ambiance.",Enjoyed this location as the gateway to our Ireland experience.  Right on St. Stephen's Green (room overlooking the park) was peaceful.  Enjoyed proximity to galleries and night life in Dublin.  Rooms were sleek.  Staff outstanding - handled several special requests with grace and efficiency.  Recommend highly.,5,2011,08,06
204,Nice hotel in a great location,"Rooms nice and comfortable. 
Very good service. 
Best thing is the location. Will use it next time in Dublin as well. ",4,2011,08,04
204,Excellent,"loved thre location, the hotel and breakfast was great.  so central.  food in the restaurant was excellent",5,2011,08,04
204,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel - Very good, but could be excellent....","We recently completed a 3 night stay in this 5* hotel whilst I was DJ'ing in Dublin and to celebrate my Birthday. 

In being a regular traveller, our expectations were based upon the hotel's 5* rating and what we have experienced in other similarly rated hotels around the World... And whilst The Fitzwilliam Hotel met / exceeded our expectations in a number of areas, there were a couple of points it could improve upon.

Firstly, the positives - 

1. This hotel is ideally situated for access to the centre of Dublin
2. Some of the staff are very attentive, Joanna on reception and Viktor the concierge were both highly customer focused and made you feel like a valued customer.
3. The bed in the room was easily one of the most comfortable we've slept in. Medium firm and nice linen, you will not struggle for a good night's sleep at The Fitzwilliam
4. The rooms are very quiet. We stayed on the 06th floor and being a DJ, returned very late knowing we would need to sleep in. The cleaner's seem able to do their jobs without excessive banging, door knocking and shouting like you get in some hotels. 
5. Room service is prompt and the food is good. Prices are what you would expect in a 5* property.

Now the 'not so good' -

1. Upon being greeted by Joanna at check in and noticing it was my birthday, she said that she would try to arrange a complimentary room upgrade the following day. However, when we then asked a gentleman (no name badge?) the following day, we were told there was no record of the discussion? Obviously if there were no superior rooms available, then fair enough, but I'm sure Joanna made a note of our discussion and we felt like we were being fobbed off.

2. Upon arriving in our room we noticed one of the loudspeaker fixings had broken and thus it was hanging off the wall by its cable. We called down and an offer was made to rectify immediately, but not what you expect to find in a property of the calibre.

3. We fancied a cocktail in the bar after dinner on our last evening, so my Wife called down to reception and asked if the hotel bar served cocktails and if so, until what time would they serve them. She was told the bar remains open for residents and cocktails were available whenever we liked. We went out for dinner and returned at 23:30 to the bar to be told that there was no fresh fruit and as such cocktails were off the menu? Maybe they just had a rush on them...? However, rightly or wrongly, we got the feeling they would rather not go to the trouble of making them. 

4. We arranged a late check out at reception for 2pm on our day of departure. But at 12:10 the room telephone was ringing with reception asking us to check out asap... Again, I'm sure our request had been noted by reception team the previous evening, but hadn't been seen by the staff that morning? A quick chat resolved, but annoying.

All in all, our opinion is The Fitzwilliam Hotel is well worthy of its 5* rating and we would happily return. It was just a shame there were a couple of niggles, mainly due to miscommunication that could (and should) have been avoided. Room for improvement yes, but the bed alone is worth making this your hotel of choice for Dublin.

Top tip - Visit the old Bank building (10 minutes walk from the hotel) for a pint of the black stuff. Amazing architecture and good nibbles!",4,2011,08,04
204,excellent hotel in excellent location,"had a wonderful weekend in dublin. hotel is in fantastic location right beside a beautiful park ( St. Stephen's green) and only 1 minute walk away from the main shopping area in dublin (grafton St.). hotel was everything you would expect from a top class hotel, excellent rooms, food and service at a great price. staff were great particularly the concierge (think his name was robert) who had an encyclopedic knowledge of dublin.  definitely worth talking to him for advice and help during your stay. in summary i would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2011,08,03
204,An excellent hotel in the heart of Dublin,We stayed here for two days at the end of July. The hotel is extremely clean and comfortable - the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We found the staff helpful at all times. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again next time we are in Dublin,5,2011,08,02
204,Loved it,"We had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam. We had a room on the top floor with a terrace, with views over St Stephens Green. The room was lovely but a little small - I had thought we were getting a bigger room but I think that was because we got the terrace. The staff were great - lovely to have a turndown service in the evening and it was very reasonable to have breakfast in the room. The bed was very comfortable and sheets were supeer soft. The bar didn't have much atmosphere and it is a pity that it is not at the front of the hotel looking out onto the street. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant. The hotel has a fab location - close to everything in the city but it's a bit annoying to have to pay extra for parking considering rooms are over 200e a night. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a romantice getaway.",5,2011,08,02
204,Good location for highlights and shopping as well as clubbing,If you want a decent night rest then make sure you have a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the inner court yard. We had one night facing a very noisy street at the front with drunk people passing by and moved to the back. Rooms at the front tend to be extremely small as you get a balcony with it. With 2 people and suitcases it was over full. We had a luxury room. Room in the back was slightly less small as it was without balcony. ,4,2011,08,02
204,SO DISAPPOINTING!!!,"Stayed in this hotel for bank holiday weekend, obvisously reading it was five star i was looking forward to a weekend of luxury and relaxation! However, the only thing the hotel has to offer is a spa that is ridiciously overpriced for in a resession especially, and a ""Gym"" that has only a couple of machines. There is no leisure centre or anything to do. There was NO entertainment in the hotel at night, the bar was soo dead that when i was in it there was only me and my five friends, the lobby is soo quiet you could hear a pin drop no music or any craic going on. The Restaurant is udnerground so you dont even get to see it unless your dining, and after paying 286 euro for the weekend we didnt even get any breakfast or evening meals in our deal, which was ridiculous for the small room we stayed in, yes very modern and stylish but for all the time u spend in it what good is that? You get a cd player in which you have a selection to choose from reception and when i asked for cd, it was going to cost me 15 euro!!!! The staff are extremly laxy daisy, i orderd room service twice and on both occasions it was a 30 to 40 minute wait and an hour for a drink the morning i was leaving. with no apoligy when it did eventually arrive. Also while me and my friends where drinking in the bar late night, we were asked a number of times to please go to our room while waiting on a pizza delivery, which i found so rude, yes it was late but when you paid as much as we did it would have been nice to have helpful staff. Also, watch the taxi drivers round the area, on both occasions we were left to wrong place by ""accident"" and were over charged!!! And to top it all off, the morning we were leaving we had to pay 20 euro for car parking for two nights.!
This hotel is completely overrated, over priced and absulutely no life about it at all!! Yes we had a jazzy room that was very comfy but unless you plan to stay in it all day and night you are going to be very disappointed, and BROKE, with this hotel!!!",2,2011,08,01
204,Quiet,The hotel staff were very kind and friendly.  The location is right across from the Luas station at Saint Stephen's Green.  It is a prime spot for shopping and the Natural History museum.  Despite being in the center of things the room was very quiet.  I would definatly stay here again!,5,2011,07,30
204,"Great Hotel, Great Location","This hotel is fabulous! The rooms are small, but glamourous. The bed is so comfortable - I sunk into it.  Breakfast is included in the price, the hotel staff was very helpful and the location was great. It's about a 15 min walk to the Temple Bar area. There is a shopping area on the way down to Temple Bar - a 2 min walk to this shopping area from the hotel.  It is also right across the street from a very nice park. The hotel staff was very helpful as well. I highly recommend staying here.",5,2011,07,29
204,Fantastic Clean hotel in an ideal location.,"From the moment we arrived the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Rooms were clean and very comfortable. Would definately recommend this hotel, although it is a bit pricey. ",5,2011,07,29
204,Beds are too small for a Swedish couple...,"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel. It was nice but definitely not to the standards of a 5 stars hotel, specially the size of the bed in the standard double rooms. We are the average Swedish couple and tried to share the double bed with our little daughter (2 years old) as it is announced ""children under 12 stay free when using existing bedding"" we thought  ""if there is space enough to fit a 12 year old in the beds, of course there won´t be a problem with our little girl""... We were wrong! To sleep there was Impossible! 
The bed was so small that my husband had to sleep on the sofa, on the floor, on the sofa again... We didn't want to order a baby cot because we really didn't see a way to fit the cot and be able to walk in such a small room.
Very nice receptionists, good location, ok business center, fruit basket in corridors... But the proportions spoiled everything!
Beware of small rooms, small beds, a Small gym ... We ended up calling this hotel ""Fitzwiliput "" I suppose this hotel is perfect for solo travelers or just-married couples but not for couples with children or big people who don't want to sleep in a ""mommy in a sarcophagus"" position.
Overpriced breakfast! Go to any of the tea rooms in Grafton street instead.",2,2011,07,28
204,Should not be listed as a 5* hotel,"Upon arrival, the Fitzwilliam does not employ a doorman and I was not met by a porter. I had to bring my 3 heavy bags into the lobby on my own. Being a frequent traveller, I have never been to a 5* hotel that required the guest to be responsible for their own luggage. A porter did help once I was halfway through the lobby. Despite asking for late check out at the time of booking, I was not allowed even an hour over check out time. I understand that the hotel was fully booked, but normally a hotel will give you an hour or two. The room service and Citron restaurant were ok, but not great. Overall, there's nothing overtly wrong with the Fitzwilliam. However, there's nothing overtly right with it either. It deserves a 4* rating rather than a 5*. I will not be staying with them again due to inadequate customer service for a top class hotel.",3,2011,07,25
204,A wonderful hotel with amazingly friendly staff.,"My family and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam earlier this month while on a leisure trip to Dublin.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and professional, and the rooms were very clean, comfortable, and had an up-scale, current feel.  Additionally, the location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Dublin on foot.  I will definitely return to the Fitzwilliam and will likely not research any other Dublin hotels.",5,2011,07,23
204,is it getting a little tired?,"been a regular business visitor for a few years but start to see that the rooms could be refreshed.  The front office reception staff are generally not at all friendly - but check in and out is efficiently processed. There are better value for money hotels nearby however location is very good. Quite a lot of "" corridor noise"" perceptible from other rooms doors opening and closing and folks tramping up and down the hallways at all hours.   Always have to remind them after the stay to credit air miles.",3,2011,07,22
204,"Great location, comfort and service.","Location @ grafton Street and Steven's Green is hard to beat.  Plus, a quality 5 star experience.  I've never been dissappointed at a ""Preferred Hotel"" property and this was no exception.  We'll be back next trip to Dublin.",5,2011,07,19
204,Fun in Dublin,"No better place to stay than the Fitzwilliam while in Dublin.  The staff and service is outstanding, especially,  the head concierge, Robert Devine.  

We'll be back for sure.

In love in Dublin",5,2011,07,18
204,Amazing,the staff was great with directing me around dublin it was my first time there and with there help i never got lost once the rooms are very nice and the breakfast was excellent as well : ),5,2011,07,18
204,Quality Hotel in a Great Dublin Location,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is a compact, upscale hotel. Its location adjacent to Stephen’s Green and Gaiety Theatre (Riverdance currently showing) is ideal. You will find delicious dining options such as Carluccio’s Caffe (52 Dawson Street), historic pubs and shopping at your doorstep. The hotel serves a traditional full Irish buffet breakfast with the best fresh squeezed orange juice and chocolate croissants I’ve ever tasted. The cost for dining at the hotel is high, so try to get breakfast included with your package. The hotel has 6 floors, several of which are nonsmoking and others that are mixed. We were on the 5th floor which was not designated non-smoking. Our room smelled fine, but smoke was evident in the hallway. The rooms are small, but the designers have made excellent use of the space. The décor is fresh with purple and lime accents. Robes and slippers are provided. We had a combo shower/ tub. The bed and linens at The Fitzwilliam Hotel are extremely comfortable and the room quiet which helped with jet lag recovery.",4,2011,07,17
204,Great experience!,"I booked one night mid-week in the hotel as a surprise for my boyfriend. We live in Dublin, so this was a romantic night away from home. Location is second to none, right at the top of Grafton Street and perfect for going for dinner/drinks in town. Decor is beautiful, and the room was beautifully decked out.

The staff were very helpful and very friendly - we were greeted good morning by every staff member we passed in the hallway! 

Breakfast was delicious also! There was an extensive buffet, as well as a hot food menu that included full Irish (which I had) and Eggs Benedict (which he had). Omlettes also looked tasty.  A great start to a long day!

Price is definitely on the high side. We availed of a mid-week offer of B&B for 140 euro. Perfect for a treat though!",5,2011,07,15
204,Ok for the area,"Nice enough hotel for Dublin. Nothing special to be honest, I would like to give it 3 1/2 stars but on reflection it is nearer to three than four so that's what I have had to give it.

Staff were quite friendly and the room was clean, but the a/c heating unit did seem to have a mind of its own. Watch out for things from the mini bar appearing as if by magic on your bill although these were removed from the bill on check out.",3,2011,07,14
204,Excellent Hotel & Great Location,"The Hotel stands at the side of St Stephens Green and is in an ideal location for everything.
Rooms are very well appointed and the Hotel still has that ""new"" feel about it. Underground parking is available for a small fee. We have stayed in the other Hotel on the Green and would consider the Fitzwilliam far better value all round.
The Reception seating area could do with being able to look out on the street. The privacy issue could be solved by installing one way glass, which would prevent that goldfish bowl problem.
All in all an enjoyable stay and would definitely stay in this Hotel again when in town.",5,2011,07,13
204,So central - close to everything,"Having visited this hotel a couple of times before it was pleasing to see that they have maintained their high standards.  Located in the heart of Dublin City, across the road from St Stephen's Green and next to Grafton Street, it is an excellent location if you need to be central.  The CD player, free wi-fi, good tea making facilities, toiletries, candles...it is all there.",4,2011,07,12
204,"Loved it, beds amazingly comfortable, would definetly go back","Great location, room was fabulous with lovely view of the green. Very pleasant staff. Turndown at night was a lovely touch, they even replenished the bathroom toiletries!!! All the little touches combined to make our stay a very relaxing one and we really felt spoilt after an evening there.",5,2011,07,12
204,Impeccable and gracious service,The hotel is stunning but what really shines is the service. The concierge in particular went out of his way to help me with a rental car. The bar has the best cocktails - it's difficult to leave the hotel for a pub crawl!,5,2011,07,07
204,Great hotel and staff!,I had a very pleasant staying at Fitzwillian and highly recommend the hotel. You will not be disappointed. And most of all the staff is very friendly and will do their best to make you confortable. Excellente location. Rooms are silent and clean.,5,2011,07,05
204,Luxury in the city,Welcoming and friendly staff on arrival. Room upgraded to deluxe on arrival with view over Saint Stephen's Green. Room spacious and clean. Large deep bath with nice bathroom products. Street noise and corridor guest noise problem late at night. Great location for shopping on Grafton Street. Breakfast room - staff slow to clear and reset tables which caused delays for breakfast.,4,2011,07,05
204,One of the great ones,"The Fitzwilliam is in an outstanding location for walking in St Stephens Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College and Temple Bar.  The Hop-ON Hop-Off bus stop is very close.  

The service of the staff (especially the porter staff) is over the top.  Everyone is friendly and make great recommendations of where to eat.  

Our room was a little small and the shower tiny, but for the location and price still a good value.

Having stayed at the Westbury, in the past, The Fitzwilliam is just as good.",5,2011,07,03
204,Great Hotel in the heart of Dublin,"The hotel is located in the heart of Dublins city centre and offers a great location for both tourists and businesstravelers. The rooms are very spacious and the delicious breakfast provides a good start into the day. Furthermore, the great bar offers very good cocktails to finish the day and to fall finally into your big bed.",5,2011,07,01
204,"Wonderful...cozy, classy and clean...loved it!",It was my fifth trip to Dubiln and my first time staying at the Fitzwilliam.  It will be my first choice for any future trips.  It's very conveniently located and about as serene as you can get in an urban area.  The handmade chocolates are fabulous!,5,2011,06,30
204,Star Star Star Star Star,"I am a frequent traveler and Fitzwiliam Hotel left me a bold five stars hotel experience.  Unbeatable location and world class hotel staff.  There were some minor hiccups issues and were all taken care off virtually instantly.  For instance, the shower head was dripping due to a malfunction cylinder and despite it was after hours with no service man on duty, a lady from customer service went above beyond her call of duty, she checked it out and attempted to rectify it with a pair of pliers and ended up got her uniform wet. The staff at the concierge are extremely friendly and helpful. Not to mention that they kept a parcel securely and safely prior to my check in date, they were able to assist us to roam in the area as well as finding the exact restaurants that we are looking for ""special thanks to Bud"".  I am residing at this hotel as I type and couldn't wait to share my joy.",5,2011,06,28
204,Excellent choice,"The best hotel in Dublin,with such great location,i would highly recommend to for Deluxe room,very nice rooms by the way. Concierge helpful and extremely professional.We've got great recommendations from them which added to our quality time.",5,2011,06,25
204,perfect place to stay,"For me the Fitzwilliam ticks all the boxes for an excellent experience.
It is in an great location being in the heart of Dublin right next to St Stephen's Green and Dublin's main shopping streets. At checkin the staff were very professional and you instantly get the feeling your stay is going to be a good experience, unlike the experience I have had at some of the other 5* hotels when checking in. I was also given internet access vouchers for the whole of my stay free of charge, other hotels should certainly take a lead from this. I was shown to my room by the person that checked me in and she was most helpful in ensuring everything was to my satisfaction. The rooms are of a high standard and the decor certainly lives up to its 'chic' hotel status. Really comfortable bed, good desk space, good seating and a very spacious well equipped bathroom - well done all round. Breakfast was fine, a good selection and a very nice full irish breakfast, although on two occasions I had to remind the waiter I had not received my food.
There is a turn down service that really is one with some lovely chocolates. The lounge is in the lobby so very small and very busy but I guess with such a nice room why use it.
I loved my stay here and will certainly return on my next visit  to Dublin.",5,2011,06,23
204,Great hotel in great location,"We spent the long weekend in Dublin and the Fitzwilliam is in the perfect spot for exploring Dublin, being on St Stephens Green, a short walk along Graftin St (the main shopping street) to Trinity college and the Liffey. We also found out it's the area where there are a lot of good restaurants and some great bars (although most of Dublin has great bars). Our room was modern clean and comfortable, through not huge. We did have a wonderful balcony area overlooking St Stephens Green with space to sit out and enjoy the views and the sunshine (yes, we had good weather!) The hotel staff are friendly and efficient and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",4,2011,06,22
204,A genuine 5 star experience.,Stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel for the first time last night and I'm just sorry that I didn't try it before now. The location is fantastic. Prices are fair and the staff set a perfect tone. Going back tomorrow on the first of many return visits.,5,2011,06,22
204,Great stylish hotel,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam on both sides of a trip to the Dingle Peninsula.  The hotel was terrific - very stylish lobby, equally as nice/stylish were the rooms (on both stays).  The rooms were not overly large, but very comfortable with very nice bathrooms.  Our rooms both had terrific views of St. Stephen's Green with the second night's room having a balcony that included a table/chairs and a heat lamp - very nice on warm spring nights.  The staff was also very nice, especially the concierge who helped us with restaurant reservations, taxis etc.",5,2011,06,20
204,We had a wonderful time and we'll be back!,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights in May. We found the staff to be wonderful, so helpful when we needed help finding restaurants, getting around, etc. We were in Dublin when Pres Obama visited which made our requests all the more challenging given the city was basically closed during his brief visit. Our room was very nice and the bathroom was luxurious. We have stayed in other major world capital cities and as compared to other hotels, the Fitzwilliam ranks high on the list. Great place to stay!",5,2011,06,18
204,Great Location.  Enjoyable stay.,"It was our first trip to Dublin, Ireland.  We are glad that we decided to stay at Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The location is great, right at St. Stephan's Greens with shops and everything right there. One can walk anywhere from there and it is not noisy like Temple Bar area.

The rooms are a little on the small end but very clean and beautifully decorated in simple and elegant taste.  The fresh orchids are a nice touch.  One tiny complaint - the sink faucets in the bathroom are not very practical.  Water splashes all over.  Other than that, the bath tub is a blissful oasis by its own.  We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant and it was a wonderful selection of fruits, vegetables and delicious ham and banger sausages.  One can also order omelette or dishes from the menu.  

One small tip - One can take Air Coach which goes directly to city center.  It only costs 7 Euro per person vs. 30 + Euro by taxi.  The bues are very clean and runs every 10 minutes or so.  It is just a short walk (no more than 5 minutes) to the hotel from the bus drop off.

All and all, it was a very enjoyable stay.   Most of all, we enjoy the friendlly Irish people.",4,2011,06,15
204,"Happy, friendly & helpful staff - yummy breakfasts","It makes all the difference when you can see the staff at a hotel interacting with each other when they don't know they're being watched and you see them treating each other with the same amount of respect and courtesy as they treat the guests. 

The service was excellent. The food was great (especially breakfast) and the room was clean and well maintained. 

We loved this hotel and we've stayed in many around the world. This one is a favorite.",5,2011,06,14
204,"Excellent hotel and superb service, we'll certainly be back","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam, Dublin, for one night. The hotel is conveniently located opposite the St Stephen Green Park, at the heart of the city, few steps from the Grafton shopping street. Close to the principal attractions of Dublin. The rooms are very pleasant; the breakfast is exceptional and generous. The service is superb, one of the very best we have ever had. We were escorted to the room by the Johana the receptionist, and they even allowed us to stay two more hours in the room, waiting to our afternoon flights, we, especially my wife were very grateful for that. Prices are a little on the high side, but it is still a 5-stars hotel. We certainly stay there in our next visit to Dublin, mainly because of the service.",5,2011,06,14
204,Fabulous...,"Better late than never.................A  girlfriend and I stayed here a while ago and I have been intending to write a rave review ever since! Actually, we stayed here on two occasions during the same trip.
It started because of the location, which you can't beat. We booked on-line + received a bit of a discount for doing so. Make no mistake, this is not a budget hotel, however the location and amenities make it worth every dime! In this case about 195 euro for a twin  room.
After a busy day on the town it was just divine ~ that's the only word which applies ~ to come back to the room and immerse yourself in the biggest bathtub I've ever seen!!
Soft, fluffy terry robes are supplied...of course, as well as various H2O Spa lotions and potions.
The lime green, purple and white colour scheme in the rooms coupled with the B +W photographs  give it a very hip vibe.
When you finally crawl into bed you can hardly believe how comfortable you are! In a hotel! There are all sizes of pillows from neck rolls to body pillows, soft linens, a duvet....it is just bliss. You never want to leave! Sigh.
But, sometimes you have a plane to catch and leave you must.
We had lunch in the lounge on one visit and dinner in the restaurant on the other. The lunch was good except for the rather disconcerting skin on one side of the fish in my fish and chips. Once discovered and peeled off, all was well.
 The lounge is an inviting little enclave to have a night cap before heading upstairs after a busy day.
Dinner at the restaurant was good but not exceptional, which I felt it should be for the price. Not really terrific enough to say you must eat here, but not so bad as to warn you off.
Last, but not least, the staff are wonderful. Friendly, helpful and professional.",5,2011,06,13
204,Excellent Location,It does not get any better than this for location in Dublin.  Right at the top of Grafton Street on St. Stephen's Green.  Parking was dead simple and relatively inexpensive for valet vs. say NYC or Boston in the US.  We had an interior room overlooking the courtyard vs. the street so it was extremely quiet.  We would definitely stay again.,4,2011,06,13
204,a gem,"A sleek modern hotel in Dublin,  Great staff, big rooms (for europe) and a wonderfull breakfast.  Across the street from a neat park and just blocks away from all the main attractions in Dublin. 
My only issue is that there is a trolley car stop outside the hotel and the trolley cars ring these little bells to announce their arrival or departure from early morning to late at night.  you get used to after about two days.",5,2011,06,13
204,So chic!,"This hotel is such a girly girl hotel and I'd hands down recommend it to any of my friends. The service was amazing, the rooms were super cute, comfy beds... close to everything. It was fantastic. We were traveling with our toddler (19-months) and they had a crib set up in the room and everything ready to go when we checked in. Second to none service. So impressed!!",5,2011,06,13
204,Best place in town,"Always need a little time to adjust in a strange place, except at Fitzwilliam. Feel at home immediately. Staff is great. Breakfast delicious. Rooms are a little small, but very well decorated and it is so quiet. Sleep so well…",5,2011,06,13
204,We loved it and we recomend it,"The location of the hotel was great, in the center, but not noisy at all. Also the stuff of the hotel was very friendly and helpful. 
I just wish the room was bigger, but honestly it was ok for the price.",5,2011,06,09
204,"""ROYALTY TREATMENT""","This hotel was First Class in every department.
We entered the hotel escorted by the very helpful staff with an easy check in.  Our luggage was taken to our room which was delightful in almost every way.  I say almost because I am use to a bit more light and a plug in in the bathroom for my curling iron and those two things were not there.  However in fairness, it has not been there from any location so far.
Now back to the experience of a lifetime!  We had a complimentary tray of fruit that came (at a perfect time I might add) and most important- our room was ready at 7 AM.  Have you ever tried to check in that early anywhere?  Most all locations in our past, you have had to wait to check in later.  In this hotel, they believe that the guest arriving are tired and need a place to rest and clean up, so they have a room available that you can use just for that purpose if your room is not yet ready to occupy!  After resting we started out needing to know where to begin and the concierges were so very helpful.  Robert and his staff were simply stated AMAZING!!  Our entire stay was just exactly that way.
Down to the smallest detail, even the housekeeping could be called Amazing as well.  We would return and our room had not only been cleaned, but tidied up as well.  Items re-arranged on the counters and desk so that your room was picture perfect each time you entered.  At night, they came back and offered a turn down service and gave us a two piece box of chocolates.   A very nice touch.  The decor was extremely tasteful and restful in every corridor, room and lobby.  We had a chance to see the Penthouse.  Now if you want pampering, this is also the place to be with 2,000 square feet of luxury!  We also for other reasons met with the sales director, Bronagh and she was also a person of extreme perfection and helpful at every turn.  So in all, if you are looking for that perfect vacation, this is it!  FIRST CLASS IN EVERY WAY.",5,2011,06,09
204,Could have been better,"Well its a gorgeous hotel, but we had no water and then the message alarm on the phone kept going off in the middle of the night. I would go back but it needs to be perfect for the money!",3,2011,06,08
204,This Place Is A Find And A Half,"I just stayed there with my wife and I can tell you without reservation this is one terrific hotel. Make no mistake, it is not the Plaza but its not meant to be. It is a very well designed, very pretty hotel in a great location. The staff couldn't be nicer and the bar and restaurant are great. The rooms are very attractively decorated and it is immaculate. I seriously love this place and I won't be staying anywhere else when I go to Ireland and I suggest you stay here too. The price is right and whatever frills you don't get you don't need. Trust me, there is really no downside to this hotel. It is topnotch all the way.",5,2011,06,06
204,Nice hotel but with nightclub noise,"A nicely presented hotel with good customer service and nice housekeeping touches eg chocs with turndown service, and excellent location opposite St Stephens Green and near Grafton St shops. We required a room to accommodate 3 so were given a choice - in itself a nice touch - between a large room at front of hotel or a small room at rear (so small I didnt realise the ""bedseat"" I thought I was looking at was actually the bed for our 160cm 11yo child) so after 4 weeks of hotel rooms, and checking the level of street traffic noise wasn't too bad once the double-glazed windows were closed, chose the room with the decent 2nd bed.
Room was lovely and clean with a reasonably comfortable bed but the noise from the nightclub 2 floors down made it difficult to sleep till after 1am. We decided not to request a new room since the staff had been very accommodating overall and we only had one more night before we headed home and just couldn't be bothered packing up twice.

A nice hotel but would recommend checking your room location if you want a restful stay.",4,2011,06,03
204,We loved it.,"Our trip was booked through Costco so all we knew about the Fitzwilliam was it's central location in Dublin  and that it was a very nice hotel.   Though the rooms were expensive the service was incredible!!   After checking us in the receptionist came out from behind the desk and walked us to our room!   The initial TV screen greeted us personally as did the card on the plate with magnificent chocolates.   The internet had a good connection and was free.  The breakfast and dinners were wonderful and the waiters/waitresses were very attentive.   The ONLY negative was our 2nd story room looked out over St. Stephens Square, which was a beautiful view, however the noise from the street at night was very loud.   You felt as if you were involved in the conversations.  Try to get a room on the highest floor.   We stayed in Edinburgh, London and Paris this trip and the Fitzwilliam was our favorite hotel.  We highly recommend it!",5,2011,06,02
204,Five Stars+++++,"Excellent service and accommodations. Staff is superb and facilities are immaculate.  Would not stay anywhere else, this place has it all.  Loved it.",5,2011,05,31
204,"Modern, Very comfortable, Fab Location",Stayed here on a 2 night city break while attending a concert at the O2. GREAT location. You can shop and then go back to the hotel to chill out for awhile if you are tired. Valet parking was really handy - given the city centre location and levels of traffic. Very friendly reception. Lovely modern cozy rooms with all mod cons - no noise. Breakfasts were nice. We booked on a weekend deal which included parking. I had researched all the nice 4 star and 5 star city centre hotels and the Fitzwilliam offered the best deal to include parking - other hotels were charging crazy money like €25 a day to park you car. Will definitely be staying here again if I need to come back to Dublin.,5,2011,05,30
204,"Friendly and helpful staff, lovely and very comfortable rooms and a great location.","Lovely place to stay.  Great location in the middle of the city.  Staff were very friendly and really helpful.  Rooms are fab - very comfortable, well decorated and really clean.",4,2011,05,29
204,"Very central location, nice hotel","Staff was helpful and polite.  Room had a nice modern decor with flat screen, free internet and all other amenities expected from a 5 star.  The bed was somewhat too soft for me but comfortable and betting of good quality.  My room was, according to the floor plan, one of the smaller one, but was large enough for 2 people.  Had as a bonus a balcony, facing the back, which I did not use.  The room was clean. The bathroom was clean, modern and functional (standard). Fresh flowers in room was a nice touch.  Only real negative was that the shower gel was of low quality (low foam, smell too intensive).  Hotel is very centrally located and there are good restaurants in the near vicinity. Overall satisfied with my stay and would stay there again.",4,2011,05,27
204,well done fitzwilliam we will be back,"My friends and I came over to stay in the Fitzwilliam for the night of President Obama's visit.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere in the city and in this lovely hotel.  It really was a taste of elegence and style..  I want to give my highest praise for the hotel restaurant.  The food was excellent, and very well presented.  We had a lovely Irish Waitress  who was infectiously  enthusiastic and full of personality.  I dont know if she was in charge because she was so young, but she seemed to be.  She was a breath of fresh air with her humour and Irish charm.  Whilst the food was not cheap, we really got a wonderful dinning experience and we wont forget soon, worth every cent.  Thanks to the waiting staff we really got the best of what Ireland should be about, a ceid mile failte.  Well done Fitzwilliam and high praise to our lovely young waitress.  We will be back.",5,2011,05,27
204,Excellent!,"This was our first time to stay here. We stayed for one night. We arrived late and were in a bit of a rush to meet friends for dinner. We were checked in quickly by a very pleasant and professional receptionist who then escorted us to our room. We stayed on one of the upper floors in a deluxe room looking onto St. Stephen's Green.  It had a very nice balcony with table and chairs. There was also what looked like a patio heater. I'm not sure as it was raining so we didn't get to use the balcony. The decor in the room was very nice. It was modern with a nice size bathroom.  The Fitzwilliam is in a great location on the Green, very close to Grafton Street so we didn't have far to go in the rain for dinner. We had a lovely meal in Pasta Fesca just off Grafton Street. A great place for drinks is Sam Sara on Dawson Street. The next day we had lunch in the Fitzwilliam bar which was very good. On checkout, the reception staff were excellent again, pleasant and professional. Will definitely come back!",5,2011,05,24
204,Great location and very plush,"You can't fault the staff of this hotel, very attentive and helpful.  The location is great being across from St Stephens Green and a 30 second walk from Grafton Street shopping, bars and restaurants.  As I was in Dublin for business I found the hotel perfect, there was always a taxi at the front door and when I got back to the hotel after a long day I could walk around Stephens Green to relax.  Within a 5 minute walk you have the best Dublin has to offer by way of bars and restaurants for dinner, everything from a traditonal pub, to Italian, Indian and modern cuisine, spoilt for choice.  The rooms are not huge but very comfortable, a large bathroom with a great shower.  The beds a super comfortable and the range of room service available is what you expect.  If I were in Dublin again for work I would definitely stay here.  One of the best attractions of the hotel is that it's not that big so you aren't overwhelmed by the number of guests.",5,2011,05,18
204,"Fantastic service, comfort and location but even for a splurge anything you get is VERY PRICEY","Everyone was incredibly nice and helpful.  Minor problems that came up or mistakes were corrected very promptly.  I got a good rate for the room but because of the occasional snacks and breakfast we spent more than it would have cost us for another night.  Remember there's a 13.5% and often a 21% VAT added to all 'services' that you DO NOT get back when leave the country as it's a 'service VAT'.
One other problem that was surprising was the difficulty connecting to the net.  You had to used daily vouchers and the connections were very dodgy.  Considering this hotel is used by businessmen I found that really surprising.  My fiance works in IT and already knew how they were routing and how to solve their problem.  It's a shame they don't work out a way for guests to connect easily without having to establish a profile on a site and then every 24 hours put in a new voucher number and it still often would not work despite taking all the steps and effort required.  That really needs to be addressed if they want to maintain a five star hotel standard and rating.
Otherwise this hotel is brilliant.  Uber-comfy beds - very quiet.  Amazing monsoon-like showers - very roomy bathrooms.  Newspaper every day.  
If you have the money to spare enjoy a snack or two using room service and the crazy prices of their breakfast.  If you're looking to splurge but keep it within reason order take away chinese or pizza if you're tired - or if you're not touring as many hours  as we were then walk to some more reasonably priced 'budget' places for meals.  And stop at a Spar's or Londis and pick up some drinks and snacks.  Looking back we'd been thinking we'd stay at Staunton's On The Green as it would include a hardy breakfast an the room prices including the VAT at booking.com were cheaper.  I've stayed at both locations in the past and the Fitz is much classier but Staunton's is a very nice Inn on the Green costs less and includes breakfast and, I believe, sones and tea in the afternoons.",4,2011,05,16
204,1st time visitor to Ireland,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel was absolutely perfect.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  We had a 10 day trip planned with the first 2 days in Dublin.  We stayed in the Fitizwilliam Hotel. After traveling on an all night flight we arrived in Dublin at 7:30am and arrived at the hotel about 8:30am.  The staff rushed to make ready our rooms and we were able to settle in about 9:00am.  We stayed 2 days.  We came back into Dublin the next weekend after traveling through the countryside (which was absolutely wonderful).  I had booked at a guesthouse down on Lower Baggot street and was so disappointed that I made reservations to stay the next night at the Fitzwilliam.  I was so glad I did.  I walked from the guesthouse to the hotel at about 8:30am.  Was greeted at the door by a very pleasant lady who when I told her my name she immediately knew who I was and was expecting me.  (when I book the previous night I  told  them I would be checking early)  My room was ready and my stay was great.  Tony the porter recognized me from the previous weekend and was genuinely excited to see me.  He took my bags to my room.  When I offered a tip he refused and said he never accepts tips from a friend.  This is typical of the wonderful Irish people.  I couldn't have been more  pleased with the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and the service has always been great.  The Fitzwilliam fits this category in service and friendly people.  It's location is perfect also, right next to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton street.  I would highly recommend the Fitszwilliam Hotel.",5,2011,05,14
204,Truly 5 Star All the Way!,"This hotel delivers outstanding service. Truly a 5 star hotel, that is hard to say at most places! I think we paid for a deluxe rate but in any case, the list of what was right is long. Still and sparkling water included in the room rate each day, small (but charming) balcony with cafe table, turn down service with chocolates every night, tea service in the room, immediate attention for any help (asked for internet code, any other questions). Literally someone was at my door in minutes when I asked for something. Location is excellent- Grafton street and all the shopping (a pedestrian street only-lovely) and St. Stephens Green right across the way. We had rooms that overlooked the park and loved the view. Modern room decor, which isn't my first choice, but the high standards of service won me over quickly. Comfortable rooms and bed. One warning, we slept there over the weekend in the front of the hotel and the crowds love their pints. Be prepared for hollering at 1:30 am when the bars let out and people head to the metro across the street. It was fleeting and didn't bother me. I can't say enough good about this hotel. The breakfast was of the highest standards too. It was our first stop  on a three location holiday and they set the bar very high for the rest of the trip. It was my favorite of the three ""5 star"" hotels we stayed in. Well worth it, would go again in a heartbeat. The staff really makes the difference.",5,2011,05,13
204,Excellent,"My husband and I had a short break at this hotel and thouroughly enjoyed ourselves.
It was our first trip to dublin and we had a lovely time and found this hotel fitted our needs exactly.
The room was very clean, spacious and we got the balconey room that we payed that bit extra for but wish we had of known that the hotel gardens were not the best view. Otherwise it was very nice.
Being a short trip we didnt take advantage of the hotels facilities but the staff were very friendly and helpful and I thought the smiley older gent who held our baggage for us on our last day so we could enjoy a final day sightseeing was lovely.
One reason for choosing this hotel was its close proximity to attractions and shopping but also quiet enough to get a good nights sleep and it fitted the bill perfectly and there was a lovely park opposite where we could have a little stroll and sit in the sun.
We will be returning to Dublin soon and would love to use this hotel again but dont think there are rooms large enough for us and our 2 children under 12. Would love to hear otherwise.",5,2011,05,12
204,five star all the way !,"I stayed in this hotel last month for a treat for me and my husband and child. We stayed for three nights and were delighted with the service and quality at all times! At check in we where greeted by  a bubble, cheerful lady. That gave us great welcome, we made our way to our room and it was the high luxury, with  the theme of purple . The location was perfect for us to venture out for a meal in a local low key restaurant (sorry cant remember the name ) the next morning we went for breakfast, we where greeted by Kevin the manger. He was plight and helpful, while the buffet was just delicious and no to busy so we got to chill and read our papers in peace. After a day of exploring we went to the bar for a drink, in the hallway we meet and young waitress. She asked if were where enjoying our stay, and after a few min of chat, she had us convinced to come to Citrin for a meal. John greeted us to the restaurant, he was friendly and the most personable Mangers i have ever meet.  We where just in time for the Pre theater (early bird) menu. We sat in ease and enjoy a beautiful meal, we where not once rushed and under pressure to leave. The same waitress that we meet in the hall, served us for the meal. She was a delightful young girl(i cant remember how to spell here name but she was Irish and a sweetheart ), who played with my daughter well i was paying the bill. After try to convince Jessy my daughter for ten min, to leave the waitress so we could go to bed, she gave her a big hug and a lolly pop. 
We went to our room and relaxed , were we slept soundly.
The hotel its self was lovely and the price was good, it lack some five star qualities  But what makes this hotel five star is the service. I will be back again, (even only to let Jessy go visit her new friend  in the staff. )",5,2011,05,11
204,"Fab hotel, fab location","Had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam - the staff were very friendly and helpful, I'd previously emailed to let them know we were in Dublin for my friend's birthday and they put cake on a 'happy birthday' plate in our room and wished him happy birthday when we arrived, very nice touch - the rooms are lovely, incredibly comfy beds/duvets the only issue i'd have was that the room was a tad stuffy during the night when the window wasn't open.

Overall the location of this hotel is excellent - St Stephen's Green and surrounding areas are the best part of Dublin (in my opinion) - and the staff were excellent, I'd definitely stay here again - providing a got a good deal on the room rate again!",5,2011,05,11
204,"Nice hotel, excellent breakfast and staff friendpu","My friend and I have just returned from 2 nights in the Fitzwilliam hotel.   We found the location very central.  The cooked breakfast was excellent, bedroom decor was very nice in bright colours.   We enjoyed the hand made chocolates when we came back to our room at night, will definately return.",5,2011,04,30
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin Ireland Review,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin offers excellent service, is in a good location for site-seeing (but collects beggars and bums on it's door-step as the rest of downtown Dublin) but is in no way a five star hotel.  Our room was a nice size, however our drapes were broken, our waste basket was broke, and the hotel offered only basic TV?  Not to mention there was no pool.  Assistance in site-seeing was limited from staff.  Cleaning staff did not understand English so communication with them was limited.",4,2011,04,27
204,"Not much kerb appeal but fantastic service , great location and good breakfast","Stayed Easter weekend. We often stay in Dublin, and decided to give the Fitzwilliam a try .On our budget had two other 5 stars to choose from.
 On arrival excelent check in, escorted to our rooms.
 Intially I though the room was small, but perfectly formed beside two little gripes.  If I wanted to get something out of the wardrobe or make tea my husband could not walk past me on the little corrider, and the bathroom did not lock. I did not report this as it was only the two of us in the room |I am pretty sure they would have sorted it out.. A little annoying but thats all. I live in Kerry which has some of the best hotels in the country. I love staying in Hotels, but I can be over critical.
I was starting to think what makes this a 5 Star ? I found out read below.
 Nice touches in the bedroom like candles and dimmer switches. The bathroom was the best, just really nice, great bath and shower Great large bed and really good quality duvets and pillows. Really really quiet room (bliss) They sent up some chocolate fudge cake as we had been celebrating our aniversary .
 On Easter Sunday morning we recieved an Butlers Easter egg with a hand written note. ( Nice touch) Great breakfast great service.Great location.
All in all  Highly recommended for location,comfort and mainly the staff . I will return.",4,2011,04,26
204,"Great Service, friendly professional staff, wonderful room, great location.","The Fitzwilliam was a real treat after spending many days in various B&B's in the country.  It is within walking distance to many attractions and shopping, which is equally important to teenage girls!

I made our reservation a couple of months ago via e-mail, and was always surprised by the extremely quick and courteous response to all of my questions before booking.  Upon my return from Ireland, I found that I had a message on my answering machine confirming my reservation!  

Negatives: (1) one night we wanted a quick meal in the bar area off the bar menu, and it was pretty obvious the waiter really didn't want us there...he was definitely trying to persuade us to go to the restaurant instead.  We stayed, the food was good, and the waiter ended up being pleasant and efficient. (2)  Doesn't seem to be very well sound-proofed - it was very noisey with doors opening and closing and people walking in the hallway; especially in the a.m. when the cleaning crews were out and about. 

I would recommend and would stay there again.",5,2011,04,23
204,Great location for shopping,Fantastic location close to boutique / department stores along Grafton Street; clean and modern rooms; friendly and helpful staff.,5,2011,04,20
204,Excellent service - Incredible location,"The Fitzwilliam was recommended to us by a Hotel Manager which is always a good sign and we were not dissappointed. We stayed the weekend of my wifes birthday, so I was looking for something special and the Fitzwilliam delivered. The staff are excellent, incredibly attentive and approachable. The room was fantastic - with incredible views over St Stephens Green. The location is wonderful - ideal for shopping, dining, museums, theatre and entertainment - all just a short saunter from the front door.

Staying at the Fitzwilliam has given us a whole new perspective on Dublin and staying in Ireland for short breaks - I have always had an itch to visit foreign cities when I get the chance - but not any more!

Our overwhelming feeling during our stay is - what a great city Dublin is and what a great place to stay. We will certainly return.",5,2011,04,18
204,Excellent on every front,"Fantastic stay. Could not fault this hotel in any way. Staff, food, cleanliness, service, location - all five star standard",5,2011,04,17
204,"Lovely hotel, staff, food.",Terrific place. Well run with a fabulous breakfast. The food and chef are top notch. Great location with easy access to all major attractions.,5,2011,04,15
204,Bliss on St Stephen's Green,"My wife and I had a night at the Fitzwilliam to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel is in an excellent position, at the corner of St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street. The staff are very attentive and friendly, and check in and out was faultless. The hotel has been renovated since our last stay a few years ago, and the decor is modern and sumptous. 
The room we were allocated was a little on the small side for a modern up market hotel at this price, although we had a wonderful view over the park.",4,2011,04,14
204,Trip of a Lifetime,"We were directed to the Fitzwilliam by Trip Advisor as well as other websites and it proved to be everything we expected and pleasantly didn't expect.  THis was our first trip overseas/Europe so we 'shopped' the many suggested hotels.  We contacted the hotel and spoke with their Director of Sales and Marketing to get an idea of what their property  can offer a family with 2 boys ages 11 &13.  Immediately we were rest assured that the Fitzwilliam would reach our expectations.  We were so far from disappointed and the hospitality (made sure we were comfortable and informed), the service (upgraded our connecting rooms due to availability), the greeting in coming and leaving (felt safe and secure), the amentities, the food, the location (across the street form St. Stephens), the decor (smart and tasteful), all this calmed the uncertainties and validated that we made the right decision in booking with the Fitzwilliam!",5,2011,04,12
204,"Excellent Location, Very nice, sophisticated decor, excellent beds.","We were very happy with this Hotel.  Excellent location to walk to most of the best sights and shopping in Dublin.  The decor was very nice, modern, clean and the service was very good.  Rooms are small but very pretty.  Beds are very comfortable, high quality.  Food was ok, not bad, just not spectacular.  Overall, a very positive experience.  The only thing we thought was that next time we would like to stay in the same area, but at a hotel with an older, more classic style.  All the Georgian architecture in this part of Dublin makes you want to have a room in that style!  This hotel has style, but of a very contemporary feel.",4,2011,04,12
204,Perfect location for a cool and trendy Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and the hotel is all you would expect from a boutique type 5 star hotel. The staff were amazingly helpful. But the thing we enjoyed most was the location. Dublin is an easy place to get around and a great walking City. Temple bar is a 5-10 min slow walk, a great park right in front of the hotel. Here’s our advice: they advertise Executive room, but these are the cheapest room which overlook an internal courtyard – this is what we stayed in. There are some rooms which have a balcony which face the park – not sure what the price differential is but I would imagine these have good views. Breakfast is expensive – I personally wouldn’t bother as there are nice places to eat nearby. There is a Butlers  coffee and chocolate shop on the corner of Grafton street and the square outside the hotel – the coffee there is really good. Taxis from the airport are about 25-30 Euro. But the 748 bus leave the airport and gets you about a 5-10 mins walk away from the hotel for 6 Euro – and if you do take the bus find out where the stop is to take you back. There is an museum nearby on Kildare Street (I think) on Irish history – well worth a visit. yAnd finally, you will really enjoy Dublin – it’s the people that really make it fun!",4,2011,04,10
204,"Great location, amazing staff",I thought this to be a very special hotel. The location is perfect. The breakfast is great (no hassle to get an expresso to wake me up). Gym is small but functional. Without exception I thought the staff were wonderful and the presentation of the hotel overall is impressive,5,2011,04,08
204,great service and excellent staff,My husband and I stayed in The Fitzwilliam Hotel recently and I am delighted to say that it was a great experience.  What is even better is that we have stayed there before and we found that they are  maintaining their standards if not improving them!  Great location and not expensive for what they offer.   My hotel of choice in Dublin.,5,2011,03,31

204,"Great value, high quality accommodation with friendly staff",Absolutely wonderful from the moment we pulled up outside to the moment we drove away the next day. Superb value in a great location. The Citron restaurant was fantastic for both dinner and breakfast. All in all a great stay with wonderful service and great value,5,2011,03,24
204,"Perfect location, wonderful service, beautiful hotel","Our room was room over looking the park, wondederful",5,2011,03,22
204,Trendy Hotel with Obnoxious Clientele,"The Fitzwilliam is a trendy boutique hotel in Dublin's city centre. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, as the service was very good, and the hotel itself is stylish. 

The only downside was many of the people staying there. There was some type of ""conference"" happening during our stay, though the attendees looked rather trashy and not even remotely professional. They treated all areas of the hotel (lobby, corridors, elevator) as if they were venues for a frat party. Imagine my surprise, being nearly knocked-over by two women in their early twenties, who were tossing-back cocktails from plastic cups, and screaming-along to music from an iPhone, whilst I was getting onto the elevator! I understand how this is technically beyond the Fitzwilliam's management's control, but it was thoroughly unpleasant. (A driver later informed us of the Fitzwilliam's local reputation of being a ""party-hotel"", though they position themselves differently.)

On a different note, though, the property itself is quite decent. Though rooms are small (tiny by Dublin standards) space is used effectively with built-in storage and furniture. The decor in the guest rooms was a pleasant change from the boringly minimalist and neutral decor of many other hotels. I particularly appreciated the scheme of green and purple and multicolour stripe, as it was fun and unexpected, and just pleasant as a whole. Beds were also comfortable (a tad firm for some, perhaps), and larger than the standard twin. Though we were initially disappointed with the room's interior view, we soon realized it was an advantage, as the local area (St Stephen's Green W. & Grafton St.) become rather noisy and ruckus at night.

The Fitzwilliam' location is both an upside and a downside. It is within walking-distance to major attractions and shopping, though it is loosely comparable to Times Square in NYC-- okay to stay in, but you would never want to live there. When the surrounding nightlife (especially the club next door) flows onto the streets at night, some ""undesirable"" (for lack of a better word) characters show-up and generate commotion.

The service at the was above average for the most part. Though the consistent absence of doormen was atypical for a five-star hotel, the majority of the staff (i.e. housekeeping, reception, room-service, etc.) was very good. The value was also very good (possible sign of Irish economic woes) as we paid a rate of  €205 per night including in-room breakfast.

Overall, the Fitzwilliam is a very decent hotel option in Dublin's city-centre. I would definitely recommend it, though I would also recommend checking-ahead incase and large groups or ""conferences"" are planned for during your stay.",4,2011,03,15
204,"Seamless experience... exemplary service, buautiful hotel, great location.","In town for a few days to visit my godfather at St. Luke's with my Dad and what could have been a difficult trip was made that much easier by all the good  folks at the Fitzwilliam. The staff - from the servers at the restaurant (great breakfast!) and the housekeepers, the  front desk (they accommodated out early check-in) to Tony at the concierge desk  (quite the story teller) - were delightful. The room was well outfitted, the beds comfortable, the stay near perfect.",5,2011,03,10
204,Great hotel in a brilliant location,"As parents of two young children, a weekend where we get to off load the kids onto  the grandparents are few and far between. So choosing a good hotel is of massive importance, and The Fitzwilliam did not disappoint!

We booked just the basic room and asked on check in if any upgrades were available, which they were (at Eur30 a night) but we wanted to have a look at the basic room first, and i'm glad we did, the standard room was just fine. Very well appointed with tea & coffee and mini-bar etc,an ipod dock would have been nice, although they do offer a CD library. 

But the best thing about the hotel is its location, just at the top of Grafton St it close to the action for shopping, and just 10 minutes walk from Temple bar, so close but not too close!

The staff were all polite, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",5,2011,03,09
204,Great location,Really good location if you wish to stay in the centre of dublin.Huge family rooms with very comfortable beds.The only downside is that the tiled floor in the  bathroom is not heated and is absolutely freezing in december. Valet parking is very efficient! and front desk staff are very friendly. Upon check-in the receptionist accompanied us to our room and made sure everything was to our liking .Very nice service!,4,2011,03,08
204,"Exceptional service, incredible breakfast, convenient location","Just spent a short weekend at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin and it was such a pleasure. From the moment I arrived, the service was outstanding. They are incredibly attentive, everyone remembers your name, and as soon as you have a question they are ready to help you. Anything you ask for, they are willing to accomodate you. The concierge desk is also very helpful. The breakfast was of fantastic quality- far better than most European hotels. The fruit was fresh, there were plenty of options for the continental buffet, as well as hot meals. I cannot say it enough- the staff were all so friendly and helpful. The beds were comfortable and the chocolates at the turn down service every night were to die for! Great big tub and great shower pressure. The location is super convenient to the tourism office, Grafton street, great restaurants, and all bus stops. Overall, I could not have asked for a better stay!",5,2011,03,08
204,staff pure 5 star class,"we stayed here on fri 4th of march and from the moment i booked in with grizelda on the phone and was given a comp upgrade it was great,i was so impressed by her i emailed corah the manager to compliment her on the manners and helpfullness of her on the phone,weve stayed here before so new we were in for a treat.when we arrived earlier than usual we were able to check in at twelve as the room was vacant th nt before,turned out it was a room with a balcony  complete with table and chairs overlooking st stephens green and although the luas is near its very quiet once the window is shut,great touch that my son loved was the comp strawberries dipped in chocolate.the room number 405 right beside the lift was amazing pure luxury and the bathroom with the luxury bath products was fab,the concierge couldnt do enough for us and ella in reception on checking in was very helpfull.on checking out i dealt with the shift manager eadaoin (forgive the spelling)and its for this reason im putting in this review,the staff make any business in my opinion ,be that a discount shop or 5 star hotel,either way you get bad manners or attitude you wont go back no matter what the offers,this hotel from start to finish screams class and its about what you want no matter who you are,top class we will definetly be back,",5,2011,03,07
204,Hidden Gem!,"This hotel is so perfect for a city centre stay, once I stepped foot into the Fitzwilliam I did not think I was in Dublin City Centre, it is so quiet and relaxed. Rooms are spotless,comfortable and quiet. I was with my husband and three year old, breakfast in restaurant first morning was very good, room service breakfast 2nd morning very good and delivered by very happy waiter. It really is the hidden gem for hotels in Dublin. Oh and not to forget the Shower is the best!!!.",5,2011,03,01
204,Excellent Staff,"Stayed in the hotel last night and cannot be too complimentary about all the staff we came across.Each member showed us the utmost curtesy and yes you could say they were doing their job but it was obvious they did care about their trade.
We have stayed in their sister hotel in Belfast which is also excellent and this was another very enjoyable trip--well done and thank you",5,2011,02,28
204,Quality Stay at a Quality Hotel,"Stayed in The Fitzwilliam earlier this week and really enjoyed it,Location is second to none.Decor is very contemporary. My room overlooked the Park out front which was a beautiful view in such a central location,Room had everything.Had a meal in The citron restaurant in the hotel,Special thanks to John and Eibh(Eve) who provided excellent service.Special mention to Aiden at front desk and Kamila in the bar.Thanks also to Will in reservations who helped me with my booking.Highly recommend this hotel and will be back",5,2011,02,27
204,Wonderful location--everything within easy walking distance. Great rooms with wonderful breakfasts.,"Great hotel--we never needed a taxi anywhere. 
Try Peploe's for dinner on St Stephen's Green--- the food was truly amazing. Even busy on a Sunday night--but make sure to make a reservation.",5,2011,02,26
204,This is not in any way a 5 star hotel,"Just stayed 2 nights here (Fri Sat)while attending a conference elsewhere. Not impressed at all. I have stayed in 2 five star hotels in recent months in London and Nice and the Fitzwiiliam has a lot to learn in comparison to these hotels.

I don't know whether it was because I was a solo female traveller or because I look  young for my age ( I'm 29) but the attitude of some of the staff was totally unacceptable. At check-in I didn't get a ""hello"" or ""welcome"" from the German? receptionist, something common courtesy would usually dictate hotel staff do as routine. Her manner was off-hand and unprofessional in my opinion. I had to ask where the lift was, I had to ask when and where breakfast was served and she didn't ask me if I wanted help with my luggage. I was also not shown to my room by any staff member even though I later heard a couple in the hallway being accompanied to their room. This is basic, BASIC customer service that other 5 star hotels provide to ALL their guests .

The room was clean, the bed was comfortable but everything about this establishment is underwhelming. There are no luxurious touches,nothing to make me want to return.The decor of the room was standard, bland hotel fare.

Breakfast was fine, again nothing to denote a five star status.

On checkout, I wasn't asked how my stay was just to nicely round off the general attitude.

The location here is the main advantage. It is situated right at the top of Grafton Street and St. Stephen's Green so a good base. Apart from that I can't say it is a special hotel in any sense.

 I hate knocking Irish tourism as I'm Irish myself but this hotel is miles behind the European competition. There is no effort being made here,the location seems to be relied on to ensure business but after that nothing sparkles, nothing made me feel valued as a customer. I won't be back and in this current climate I would recommend you stay somewhere else where your custom may be appreciated.",2,2011,02,20
204,Excellent Hotel In An Excellent Location,Great boutique hotel located right on Stephen's Green and adjacent to Grafton St. and the Stephen's Green Shopping Center.  Harry's Bar just around the corner is a great place for a cocktail or a pint.,5,2011,02,19
204,Wonderful location!,"At first we were a little disappointed with the understated appearence of  the entrance, but we were so wrong, bacause this hotel is really great! The cozy room (be sure to get 2 twin beds as the 1 double is the American Full size bed) , the modern decoration, the polite  reception staff, the breakfast, etc.,everything contributed for us to really enjoy our stay, but above all was the location: Just perfect! Walking distance to all we wanted to see, and surrounded by excellent restaurants recommended by the knowledgeable concierges! I will surely recommend The Fitzwilliam to all my friends who are travelling to Dublin.",5,2011,02,18
204,Good As Gold,"Having never been to Ireland before we were relieved to arrive at the Fitzwilliam to be greeted by the wonderful concierge team. Lead by Robert, the team provided myself and my family with a comprehensive guide to not only Dublin itself but local day trips to near by locations like Wicklow and Hoath that were amazing. The local knowledge sure made our trip and the personalised service was much appreciated! The Fitzwilliam is well appointed and well worth the money for the service alone.",5,2011,02,17
204,Excellent location and lovely hotel.,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam on Valentine's night and pre-booked via the hotel's website.  Pre-booking our evening meal was excellent value, although there did seem to be a glitch with the online booking that the professional staff quickly overcame. 

Also despite the fact the menu for the evening meal was fixed, the staff happily arranged for a cheese board instead of the listed puddings.

The hotel seems a little more tired than its sister hotel in Belfast.  However, we had one of the rooms overlooking St Stephen's Green and the view and small balcony were beautiful.  I do think the rooms vary in size quite a bit, so if you are given one of the smaller rooms it would be worth asking if there is anything else available.

The location is perfect, central, but away from the hens and stags in temple bar.  The hotel staff were unbelievably helpful, an extended check out, arranged at the last minute, and was free of charge and no problem to them.

Brilliant Valentine's break.",4,2011,02,16
204,My Home away from Home... actually... it was better then that.,"Fantastic stay at this hotel.  I have stayed at a number of hotels and this would rate very high on my list of fantastic experiences.  Ideally located, phenomenal service right from the moment I walked through the door and great food.  All of the staff were very professional as well.  Great amenities and I look forward to my return.",5,2011,02,11
204,A taste of luxury and quality with friendly proffessional staff,"We spent a night in the FitzWilliam Hotel as a treat. The reason that I had chosen it was due to a recommendation by a friend, and due to a competitive price despite its 5 star rating. Its central location was terrific, our lovely room was overlooking St Stephens Green. The food was absolutely delicious, some of the best food I have ever tasted in Ireland. My highest praise is for the staff, they were so warm and friendly whilst being professional and discreet. We had a marvelous Irish waitress in the dining room, who told us she was from Galway, who made our meal so special with her warmth and cheerfulness. She was a little gem! The only thing better than the dinner was the breakfast, fantastic.  I highly recommend the hotel for the style, luxury and quality of food, service and affordability. Great value for money, a real treat !!",5,2011,02,10
204,"Fantastic location, great hotel!","I picked this hotel because of the reviews on here & because of it's great location. I wasn't disappointed! The location is superb, on St Stephen's Green you are centrally located for shops, bars & restaurants, all within walking distance. Staff were friendly & helpful. My one complaint is that there was a peculiar smell on our floor, not sure what it was, but couldn't smell it in our room.",4,2011,02,08
204,"Not so 5 star,","so the first room i go to the TV doesnt work and the wifi doesnt connect me,  Get changed to a new room - and the TV doesnt work and the Wifi doesnt connect me - get the drift - Then the door falls off the mini bar,  room looks ok albeit a bit small but the electrics are dodgy - light keeps flickering an and off,  too tired to try and ring down to get someone to fix it, 
go to bar and gin and toninc is warm, and expensive, and the bar food - dont bother- watery steak like it had been stewed.  I just dont understand why people pay to stay here - because probably they are like me and the company does.   Staff are ok - but all European - you know what i mean - no one really speaks english,.  OK up to a point,   Then the breakfast arrives 20 minutes late in my room - so have to rush before a meeting,  

I wouldnt bother staying here if it was my own money.,  Rip off Britain - woops sorry Ireland, .",2,2011,02,08

204,"A Golden Family Memorie, No such things as a no !","I stayed here for my new years eve with my young child and boyfriend. We stayed in a ""average room"" but there was ""average"" about it, the style was modern and flawless. on our first night  we arrived late, so we ordered room service. The portions were perfect amount, and they had no problem for me to offer off menu for my young son. The young man who served it to our room as a sweetheart  who made me and my boyfriend feel in great hands. For our new years eve celebration we went to the restaurant for your meal. It was FABULOUS! At first the service as scattery when a young (Polish? or Russian?) man was rushed about as it was very busy but by the starters a Irish girl came and stayed as our waitress, and from then there was no such thing as no! our glasses were never empty and our bellys were kept full. My son became a huge fan of hers when she showed him a magic trick, and some how got him to eat his potatoes..I don't know how she did it but what i do know is that this hotel has amazing five star service.. I would recommend it to the Queen! I'll be back !",5,2011,02,03
204,Perfect way to spend your 40th.,"On arrival at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Dublin we were very warmly greated.  The checkin receptionist took us up to our room, which had a lovely four poster bed with a little balcony overlooking St Stephens Green.
Chocolate covered Strawberrys were also left in our room and a birthday wish from the manager. 
The dinner in the restaurant was lovely and over looked reception area.  The bar was lively with great service.
Breakfasts were fantastic, so much choice.
The only recommendation I would give to the hotel would be for some biscuits to be available to have with coffee/tea in room.
Could here music coming from the niteclub next door, but soon fell asleep so not too annoying.
Cant wait to go back.",5,2011,02,03
204,"Excellent hotel, perfect location!","A fantastic spot - so convenient for all the sights of Dublin! All the staff were fantastic - nothing was too much trouble, everything done with a smile even when they were busy.
Super view over St Stephens Green. Breakfast was an amazing spread, the smoked salmon was delicious!",5,2011,01,31
204,Simply Beautiful,"Everything about this hotel is simply amazing. From when I parked the car until I got to my room every member of staff was courteous, friendly and welcoming. Check in was easy and quick and I was then shown to the lift. The bedroom itself was gorgeous, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the bathroom was lovely. The small touches such as the bathrobes, slippers, chocolates on your pillow, towel changes before bed really makes this place stand out from the rest. The next morning I decided to order breakfast in bed. It was fabulous! and may I say well worth 6euro extra charge. Although I was checking out that morning I wished to do a bit of shopping, the hotel had no problem letting me leave my car there, which I thought was very good. The only downside to this hotel is the feeling you get when you have to leave it.......",5,2011,01,30
204,"Gorgeous room, perfect location","I spent my last two nights in Ireland staying at the Fitzwilliam.  When I arrived, it was a bit early and my room was not yet ready.  I was told that an upgraded room might be available sooner.  Under most circumstances, I'm suspicious of the up-sell.  But in this case, I thought, ""Why not treat myself?""

I ended up with a gorgeous room with a terrace overlooking the green.  So glad I upgraded.  

When I came to breakfast with my friend, we were referred to as Mr. and Mrs. _____.  i thought it was nice, he growled.  But I appreciate the attention to the name of the guest.  

I will admit that in the evening when we came back to the hotel, we stopped in the bar and were the only people there.  The bartender was cleaning up, but it was a bit desolate (even thought it wasn't near closing time).  

All told, the location can't be beat.  The bed was wonderful.  And the bathroom!  When traveling in Europe I'm often disappointed by hotel bathrooms, but this was wonderful!  Staying in the Fitzwilliam isn't a bargain, but it's a great treat for a stay in Dublin.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2011,01,28
204,"Location, Location","This was a great stay. The room was comfortable and the bed was really comfortable. Service was generally very good and the location is one of the best in Dublin. It can be a bit loud on the street side at night, but that's a small trade off for having everything so accessible. WIth the Luas in front of the door its only a hop to Dundrum Shopping. The bar has a nice atmosphere in the evening, and can be fun. If you have a few nights in Dublin you can do everything from here on foot.",4,2011,01,27
204,Enjoy warm service in a lovely convenient spot!,"Upon arrival from Boston in the early morning, we were urged into the breakfast room for a lovely meal.  Our room was ready for a nap at 7:00 am (I know that can't always happen)!  The concierges were especially warm and helpful with directions and suggestions.  Chocolates each night didn't hurt.",5,2011,01,20
204,Outstanding,"My last visit to the Fitizwilliam in July 2010 was disappointing.  I complained and the Manager Fergal O'Connell responded most professionally apologizing for my experience and accepting responsibility.  He asked me to give the hotel another chance and offered one night free should I return.  In Dublin over New Year I spent three nights at the Fitzwilliam.  It was simply wonderful in all respects -- staff, room, service, food.  From the staff at reception to the staff in the restaurant everyone was very professional and friendly.  The room was wonderful -- great bed, wonderful bathroom -- and cleaned to perfection each day.  It did not take long for me to forget my last visit as I experience again the Fitzwilliam I remember from earlier visits.  This is a great hotel all around -- location, rooms, ambiance, staff, service ... the only place to stay in Dublin.  It has earned its five stars and compares favorably to some of the great hotels of the world.  I will be back.",5,2011,01,13
204,A romantic getaway,"Stayed at the hotel last weekend as a surprise night away for my husbands 40th birthday, leaving 3 kids at home including a new baby so I was looking for a comfortable, quiet room to relax in and catch up on some sleep. The room was gorgeous with loads of extras such as the fluffy gowns, slippers, stereo also in the bathroom and a generous bath with middle taps. When I booked the room i had told the girl that it was a night away for my husbands birthday and when we arrived at our room we were surprised to see a plate with 3 little cakes on it. Whether it was connected or not it was a lovely touch. Also that night we were offered a turn down service and chocolates. As we didn't eat that night in the hotel I cannot comment on that, however the breakfast the next morning was delicious and cooked especially for us which is delightful.  Much nicer than having it served buffet style where the hot food is being kept warm. Also breakfast was served till 12pm which a great luxury for us as we enjoyed our lie on. My only complaint was that we only had the one night here!",5,2011,01,11
204,Perfect Weekend,"Used this hotel for a trip to Dublin to see the pantomine.
Travelled with my wife and three kids under 10
Great room - small suite with kids beds in living area.
Perfect location
Great service
Great parking
Excellent value",5,2011,01,11
204,Fantastic,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam the night before the Dublin marathon.  I usually stay in Jurys or the Burlington the night before the marathon in past years however decided upon a change this year due to poor experiences the last couple of years, and I must say I did not regret the decision.

I booked two rooms, one for my wife and I , and one for my parents.  The hotels location is hard to beat,. right at the top of grafton street.  The rooms were spacious, well decorated and offered free internet.  The staff were incredibly good!  I have been lucky to stay in numerous hotels through work and my personal life, and I can safely say their customer service and attention to details was second to none.  This was reflected when my father's car experience difficulties when restarting it.  The front of house staff did everything they could to get him back on the road.

The food was also excellent, especially important the night before a marathon.

All in all fantastic hotel and I will be back in October 2011",5,2011,01,07
204,Delightful Stay,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel over a short stay in Dublin.  The hotel was charming, the staff was friendly and helpful.  The room (430) was at the back of the hotel which made it a long walk from the elevator, but very very quiet.  The room was clean, the decor was fun and we got nearly all our bulky sweaters and coats stored in the limited on storage space.  The gym was great (had it all to myself one morning, got in nine miles on the treadmill).  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2011,01,02
204,Incredible rooms,"Stayed a weekend at the hotel and was very impressed with the rooms, modern but still with colours! And the fresh flowers in the room was wonderful, also it was quiet and with a nice view of the garden. Also liked the personell which was professional, helpful and kind. The star restaurant was nice but the food was a bit to complicated for me, would chose another place to eat next time. But all in all a very nice hotel and I would absolutly stay there again if I go back to Dublin.",5,2010,12,30
204,5 Star Quality and 5 Star Service,"We booked this trip through Itravel and didn't know much about the hotel or city. We were so happy to find the hotel was right in the heart of the city and was superb! We stayed over Christmas and didn't know that all of the local bars and restaurants close Christmas eve at 6 and don't open again until noon on the 26th and the hotel was very accommodating in fitting us into the booked out restaurant when we didn't have reservations. We had heating issues in the first room, and we were upgraded to a room with a view of St Stephens Green within an hour of informing the front desk staff. The rooms were spotless, and I loved the fold down service with luxury chocolate! The front desk staff were extremely helpful in providing us with directions to the attractions, referrals to restaurants and giving us good tips about the city. I would stay here again in a heart beat! We are already discussing our next trip to Ireland for 2012.",5,2010,12,29
204,Excelllent but !!!!!!,"Nice staff and hotel.  Foyer and Receptlon need overhaul - better reception area in a prison!

The Bar is a disaster - no atmosphere and when full coversation impossible.  Whole groundfloor needs a complete makeover.  Belfast Hotel much more attractive.

Would stay again",3,2010,12,19
204,Great Hotel - Both location and decor,"I stayed here with my husband to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. It's a great spot. The location is ideal - right at the top of Grafton St (main shopping thoroughfare) and near to all shops,restaurants and bars. It wasn't noisy (I thought it might be because of the location but it wasn't in the slightest). The decor of the hotel is contemporary, a really luxurious spot. We also had lunch there which was also lovely - very tasty. Having family in Dublin we had  a list of recommendations for all the good restaurants (from fine dining to casual) but were pleasantly surprised to find a similar list in the hotel room. I usually find hotel restaurant lists aren't on the money but their list was.

We booked this via WhataHotel - Great deal. The room rate included breakfast and a €50 food and beverage voucher which we used for lunch and bellinis! 

Oh and finally - our room had a roof terrace (with tables, chairs and a patio heater) overlooking Stephens Green park - very romantic",5,2010,12,14
204,"Perfect Location, but the hotel could use some updating","First things first, even though I didn't rate the hotel a 5, I loved staying here. Considering the weather and travel difficulties recently, the fact that my wife and I stayed at the start/end of Grafton St., 5 minutes from Trinity College, 10 from Temple Bar, etc..., this hotel was perfect. I loved the full breakfast that was included with the room, and for the first time got to eat white and black pudding. The staff were all friendly and helpful - as much as they could be. The concierge staff was a bit hit or miss - some really knew their stuff, some not as much - but all were friendly and helpful, and that's all I really could ask for.

The only problem, if I could call it a problem, was the room. It was warm and comfortable (that alone was treasured), but looked worn. There were stray black marks on one of the walls and the tiles in the bathroom were chipped and the grout was stained in some spots. Overall, these were just a couple of niggling issues my wife and I had, but we both loved the hotel.

Oh, one last thing. The Wi-Fi was a bit annoying. You need a password every day for each device you plan on using. My wife and I both used our smartphones and I had my laptop with me, so when we went up to the room, we were carrying about 20 sheets of paper. Logging on was easy, but each time we closed our device, we closed the Wi-Fi connection. If we tried to use the device 10, 15, 20 minutes or 3 hours later, we had to enable the connection all over again. But again, that was a small thing. 

Overall though, we loved staying here and would gladly do it again. If you're considering the Fitzwilliam and choose it, I don't think you'll be disappointed. 

I just wished the weather had been nicer.",4,2010,12,10

204,City Heaven,"Had a fantastic time in this hotel on St. Stephens Green, a one minute walk from the shops on Grafton Street.  Location could not be better to see the City.  Extremely friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble.  We enjoyed it so much we stayed an extra night.  Food very good and rooms very comfortable with all the mod cons.  Would highly  recommend a stay here.",5,2010,12,06
204,Quality hotel in central location,"Having stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast recently, we chose the Dublin Fitzwilliam hotel based on the excellent standard of the Belfast hotel.  The hotel was well located in Dublin, just off Grafton Street and opposite St Stephens Green.  All the sightseeing was within walking distance and it was easy to get to Temple Bar.  The rooms were of a slightly lower standard (especially the bathroom) than the Belfast hotel and we had a very uninspiring view of the office block next door.  Not sure who qualifies to receive a park view! The concierge were very helpful with directions and leaving luggage with on our check out day.  The lobby was so beautifully decorated with a big christmas tree.  The booking didnt come with complimentary breakfast (seems a rarity these days) and we noted on the room menu that breakfast for 2 was a staggering 60 euros!!!!! However the prices in Dublin generally were quite astounding.  The hotel was really nice but wont be rushing back to Dublin because of the prices!!!!",4,2010,12,04

204,Fantastic room in a great location....,"We landed a good rate online and got an upgrade to a room with a balcony - great view overlooking St. Stephens Green with tons of space outside and a small table and chairs.

The room was very comfortable with a spacious bathroom.",5,2010,11,23
204,If I go to Dublin again that's where we would like to stay again!,"Great location, excellent concierge(s) gave us wonderful restaurant advises, the Hotel is the home for a one Michelin star restaurant - with fantastic food and service (Thorntons), friendly atmosphere, clean rooms.",5,2010,11,22
204,"Great location, staff & rooms","Perfect location off St.Stephens Green, hotel bell staff were fabulous, gave us great ideas for food & entertainment.  The rooms were modern & clean.  We found a great price online.",4,2010,11,21
204,"Quality, convenience and child friendly with five-star, old-fashioned service","The convenience of the Fitzwilliam's location is second to none, with free valet parking as an added bonus. The restaurant staff fussed over my four year old daughter and won her over with a smiley face on her hot chocolate :). The old-fashioned courstsey and service of the doorman was fantastic and certainly enhanced the welcome vibe the hotel exuded. Thank you to all",5,2010,11,21
204,"Very nice hotel, great location","All was very good, nice helpful staff, great rooms, comfortable beds, great location and views",4,2010,11,21
204,A perfect hotel in a perfect location!,"Arguably the best location in Dublin, almost all the sites are in walking distance and those that are not, are a 10 Euro cab ride away! The staff and service provided is a luxury on its own, along with the bells and whistles...i.e. free wifi, an amazing entertainment package for the tv (it is pricey), and V.I.P  treatment at the Dandelion Bar next door.  I would stay there again and highly recommend to others.",5,2010,11,20
204,Absolute Luxury,"Staff very professional & pleasant. Accommodations extremely comfortable, loved the bathrooms and the candle is a nice touch.",5,2010,11,20
204,Fantastic over night stay,"My colleague and myself stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel for one night, the rooms were very modern and quirky, with excellent facilities and very clean and immaculate. We also had breakfast, which was fantastic, it was the perfect way to start the day. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly, and the service provided was excellent. As we had to work through the night we asked whether we could have a slightly later depart time so we could have a longer sleep, and this was not a problem, they were more than happy to allow this and we did not have to pay any additional costs. The whole hotel was lovely, and i could not fault one part of it. Location also perfect.",5,2010,11,19
204,Outstanding hotel in every respect...why stay anywhere else?,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel at St. Stephen's Green in October of 2010.  She was in Dublin on business and I tagged along for strictly for fun.  After difficulties with our air travel which resulted in lost luggage and a delayed arrival, the team at the Fitzwilliam welcomed us warmly, provided us with complementary toiletries, and kept in constant contact with us and the airlines until our luggage was located and delivered to our room.  

Speaking of our room, it was spacious and well-appointed.  The bed was very comfortable, items such as a hair dryer and an in-room safe were present, and the mini-bar was loaded with premium beverages and snacks.

The on-site restaurants and bar were excellent.  Service was friendly and prompt, prices were reasonable, and the food was quite good.  My wife even held several small meetings in the bar area with great success.

Above all, I must commend the staff for their friendly attitude and thoughtfulness.  The team at the front desk could not have been more helpful.  The concierge service knows everything...and I mean everything.  If they couldn't find something on a map, it's because it didn't exist.  I took a walking tour of the city over the course of three days and with their directions, I never got lost once.  The restaurants recommended by the staff were the best we visited and their knowledge of local pubs is impressive.

We fell in love with Dublin and it's people and plan to return again soon.  When we do, we will definitely be staying at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2010,11,19
204,Not worth it,"Have been staying in various business hotels in Dublin and Fitzwilliam is just not worth its price. The entrance is really nice and cosy but the rooms are really small, bathrooms are not nice at all (with different plumbing issues if the 3 rooms I had in 3 weeks) and the service is far from being diligent. Not a 5-star hotel, but would be a nice 3 star hotel :-)

While breakfast is an overall awful experience, their fine dining Thornton's restaurant is really nice :-).",3,2010,11,19
204,Nice hotel but dreadful smell of sewage,"Whlst this is no doubt a top class hotel and staff are very pleasant, I have on two occassions during October had to complain of a) smoking on a non-smoking floor and b) had to be moved due to a different room due to the smell of sewage in the room and  around the lift shaft area of the building.",2,2010,11,19
204,A lovely hotel in a great location...and amazingly quiet for somewhere so central!,"Hotel is lovely, staff are helpful and friendly, location is fab, beds are comfy and it really is amazingly quiet.",5,2010,11,19
204,OMG totally luxury in the heart of Dublin,"We stayed Aug 2010 for our 10yr wedding anniversary. The hotel standards are exceptional, food amazing & staff couldnt do enough. The extra complimentary touches added to our room for our special occasions were very touching.
Breakfast to die for - totally recommend the egg benedict. Without doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Will be back again and again.",5,2010,11,19
204,It's the service that counts when the hotel itself is highly rated,"The Fitzwilliam was the ideal place to stay when we had our first visit to Dublin.  The reception, the concierge, the quality of the hotel, breakfast, the room itself - all of these far exceeded our expectations.  Additionally, Dublin has got to be one of the friendliest places to visit, pub crawl and take coastal walks.  We were always given excellent advice by the Fitzwilliam concierge when we required it and all of his recommendations turned out to be perfect.  Dublin must be visited.  The Fitzwilliam has the perfect central location, close to a super indoor shopping mall, pedestrian shopping streets, nightclubs, a lovely park, and right next to the necessary local transport.  You will certainly not regret this fabulous hotel with its giant tubs and wonderful beds and friendly staff.",5,2010,11,19
204,Just what I needed!!,"I stayed here with my son having recently lost my dear husband and we had some Banking business to attend to.  My son had stayed with you before and he recommended you to me.  My first impreession was none too good I felt your reception area to be dismal.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed mystay with you and the 'little touches' you have were very warming.  Who knows, I may stay with you another time.  Thanks.",5,2010,11,19
204,"excellent staff, helpful at every turn","Everything you want and expect, but don't always find in a hotel of this standard. The location, facilities and service were faultless. I even forgot something, and they posted it to me, no questions asked. 
If you are considering this hotel, but wondering if it's worth that little bit extra, go on, spoil yourself! Trust me, the extra touches made our stay so much more comfortable.",5,2010,11,16
204,Great location & Staff but would not think 5star,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam in November with a friend.  We were on a one night break away to do some shopping and go for a nice meal.  The location of the Fitzwilliam is great (though driving to the car park is a bit of a puzzle).  We checked in very quickly and were taken to our room by the girl at reception.  Our bags arrived very quickly afterwards.  We had ordered a twin room and got a double but we didn't mind too much.  The rooms in the Fitzwilliam are very nice.  In excellent condition and very comfortable beds. The rain shower in my room was not very hot - which was strange as the water to the bath was.  I mentioned it at reception on my way out and someone was to check it.  I am not sure if this was done as there was no message left.   I think the hotel seems five star by its reception, rooms and staff.  Where I think it falls down is in the bar and restaurant area.  The bar is very three star and not a place that you'd relax in for an evening.  I only viewed the restaurant ""Citron"" for breakfast and found it lacking in atmosphere and decoration also.   I would return to the Fitzwilliam.",4,2010,11,15
204,Chic and friendly,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam's in mid Sept. and could not have been more pleased with our choice. The rooms were very stylish and the location suburb! Tons of pubs and shopping within steps. Not to mention the super helpful concierge that helped us plan out a wonderful day trip to the west coast, along with great dinner recommendations at The Pigs Ear.",5,2010,10,30
204,What a fantastic hotel!,"From the ideal location across from St. Stephen's Green, to the incredible staff, large and fabulous rooms, the Fitzwilliam was not only a wonderful hotel, but the ideal location to start our trip to Ireland.  We knew it was going to be great when we arrived around 9:30am, weary from the journey, and the manager told us he'd get us into our room early and to enjoy some complimentary coffees while we waited.   Within the hour we were relaxing in our room overlooking St. Stephen's Green!  A highlight of the hotel though, is the excellent service.  The head concierge, Robert Devine, is the best in the business and makes this a not-to-miss hotel.  He spent an hour on the phone helping us figure out our Verizon intl service - way about the call of duty!  If you're in Dublin, you must stay at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2010,10,27
204,Beautiiful hotel with a great location.,"Rooms are wonderful, and very nicely furnished. Great location for walking around Dublin. I would give it 4 1/2 stars, just not special enough to be a full five  stars. That said it is a very nice hotel and we would stay ther again.",4,2010,10,19
204,Best Hotel I have ever stayed,"Yes the most pleasurable experience in terms of sleep and surroundings. 
- even swapped the wet towels during the turn down service.
Wonderful breakfast, lovely coffee, and free wireless/newspapers included.
Only minor gripes were'drencher' shower head a little low for my 1.95m frame and midnight snacks out of the question - no 24hr room service (?).
But I shall be staying there in a few weeks when i return to Dublin, no question.",5,2010,10,16
204,"Beautiful hotel, lovely room.. Room was...","Beautiful hotel, lovely room.. Room was 170 euro's and I didn't get a wink of sleep all night! The hotel is directly opposite a tram which on the week night I stayed was noisy till at least 2.30am, the hotel is also on the same road as several bars which were also very noisy. I asked to be moved at 3am, but was told there were no other rooms and they had no ear plugs. ",2,2010,10,15
204,The staff was exceptionally pleasant...  updated hotel.,"We stayed here for a week in Sept 2010 for an HVAC incentive trip.  The Fitzwilliam was central to all the night life and shopping.  It was easy to hop on a train, bus, or taxi.  The hotel was very clean and updated.  It has a very warm and cozy lobby with a fireplace.  The conceirge staff had all the right recommendations and was very pleased with it all.

The only problem we had was continuous faulty room keys and room safe keys.  Pretty minor considering our experience with the Fitzwilliam.",4,2010,10,07
204,"Having stayed in 20 rooms last year, this one sticks out most in my memory.","Amazing atmosphere / location. 
Great staff.
Beautiful interiors.
Being on the road a lot last year, meant I stayed in 20 hotel rooms across Europe and The UK. This one sticks out furthest in my mind (second would be Park Hyatt, Istanbul.)",5,2010,10,02
204,Definitely not 5 star!!!,"Like another reviewee who stayed the night of the fore alarms..we were there the same night. Again no apologies. The fire alarm went off a third time the next morning at breakfast, so the lifts were out of order. 5 flight climb back to the bedroom. Delayed going back to our room as the porter had to unlock each door on each level which led from fire escape stairs to our bedrooms. When I questioned this, I was told there was only one flight of stairs- one way out of the building if there was a fire...doesnt inspire you does it. We were charged 10euro for parking on top of the 260euro for the twin room....buffet was fine..but the decor is a bit too funky/modern for my liking. I would describe this hotel as a business hotel. The girl on reception was completely lacking in personality. The mini bar in our room could not be accessed due to a technical problem. Given the chance, I would have stayed in the Shelbourne. What a waste of money for what was a rare night away.",3,2010,09,30
204,Absolutely the best stay I've had anywhere,"I am a travel writer and have stayed in hotels all over the world.  The Fitzwilliam Hotel is absolutely one of the nicest places I've ever stayed.  The beds are superlative, the staff beyond reproach, the concierge group are indescribable in the strong desire to meet your every need and the breakfast there is nothing short of amazing. 

The location is one of the best in the city, right near the shopping of Grafton Street, across the street from St. Stephan's Green Park, just down the street from Trinity College and around the corner from the Hop On/ Hop Off bus tour.  In addition, they are a short cab ride to both the airport and the train station as well as being a couple blocks from the Dublin Tourism Office.

I have no complaints about the hotel in the slightest.  It's some of the best sleeping I've been able to do when traveling.",5,2010,09,28
204,2 fire alarms in 1 night,"this hotel is in a great location; top of Grafton St and an ideal base for shopping and fine dining. We had booked a twin room but when we went to check in had to make do with a double, end of story. The fire alarm was activated not once, but twice during the night, with no explanation or apology from staff/management. Nice hotel but I get the impression that they couldn't care less about the customer. A ""heads on beds at all costs"" policy is ok when things are going well and the bookings are rolling in, but will that always be the case?",3,2010,09,26
204,Great location and top room,"This was  a fantastic hotel, great location at the top of Grafton Street and on St Stephen's Green so really good for sight seeing and getting around. Despite its central location the room was really quiet so great for getting a bit of kip. Everyone has raved about the beds so no more needs to be said there. Nicely appointed rooms with everything you need including a little stereo which was a nice touch.
The only minor disappointment was that I would have liked to catch the nail bar lady but that is such a girlie non-vital thing it hardly rates a mention.
For those on an alcohol free/limited diet they do non alcoholic cocktails in the bar! Cool, no more lemonade or diet coke for me! Hurrah.",4,2010,09,17
204,"A hotel well worthy of it's 5 star status in a fabulous location, providing a luxury stay","I've stayed in many hotels in Dublin, and this by far has been the best to date. The location of St Stephens Green is fantastic. The beautiful park is directly opposite, and Grafton Street for shopping is right on the doorstep. Perfectly situated within walking distance of the lively bars and Temple Bar, yet the layout is cleverly planned with my particular room overlooking the prviate garden, thus a perfect and peacefull nights sleep was possible. The hotel lives up to reputation and all of the staff from reception, to waiters, concierge, room service etc all treat guests with a warm and friendly welcome. The interior design by Sir Terence Conran is contemporary and stylish, and the ambience is just beautiful. I stayed in Sep 10, and I'm just about to book to go back in Dec 10. Would highly recommend, and although it is quite expensive, it is well worth it.",5,2010,09,13
204,The Fitz is my RITZ...,"From Reception to Concierge, to the beds......our stay was THE BEST in Ireland!  We must say the Concierge guys were tops!  Their dinner recommendations were excellent, and they interceded at another hotel on my part for my mistake.  They made quick laundry arrangements and we will tell everyone we know about the Fitz! 

The rooms were incredible! The location is in the midst of it all.....

FREE WIFI  :)",5,2010,09,11
204,Wonderful hotel with amazing beds!,Beautiful rooms with amazingly comfortable beds. Concierge staff were always keen and interested to help with questions. Very central location. Modern hotel. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2010,09,07
204,The beds-the beds-the beds,We staed here for our 1st two nights in Ireland. The location was perfect. Close to everything. We walked everywhere and loved ending up back at the Fitzwilliam. While it was the priciest of the 4 hotels we stayed at the amenities and location made up for it. Breakfast was included and it was enjoyable also,5,2010,09,04
204,Fantastic place to stay!,"The location is great - right across from St. Stephens' Green and close to Grafton Street.  You can just walk across the street to catch the sight-seeing buses. The beds are very comfortable, and the bathrooms are luxurious, with full-size (very large) bathtubs. The staff was extremely helpful!",5,2010,09,01
204,Fantastic,"We managed to get a reasonable rate for the hotel but room only.  It was absolutely fantastic.  The guys on Concierge were just amazing - providing every possible piece of information you could want and making a huge contribution towards a wonderful stay.  The location at St Stephen's Green was just excellent for getting around the City Centre.  The only reason for giving a 4 for value was the hotel's breakfast - 23 Euro each per  night.  I thought that was excessive however, chocolates put in the room every night, fresh apples on the landing, free sparkling water in the minibar and a room to die for...",5,2010,08,31
204,"Loved this hotel, location is perfect","The Fitzwilliam is a great hotel - a luxurious, modern feel as soon as you walk through the door. Staff were really helpful and friendly. Our room was on the 4th floor and it was quite small but very comfortable and we even had a balcony with table and chairs which overlooked St. Stephen's Green. The Fitzwilliam is not cheap but I managed to find a really good deal on getroomscheaper which was fantastic. Breakfast is quite pricey but again, good quality.",5,2010,08,31
204,A lovely hotel in a great location,"The hotel was very tastefully decorated. We had an early flight over so arrived t 11.30am. We checked in straight away and a room was available. This was great as it allowed us to explore the city straight away. The room was lovely and clean, very modern with a VERY comfortable bed! Tea and coffee provided, plus the usual things you'd expect from a hotel of this standard. The only downside was that the shower went cold once when I was showering. We found Dublin to be quite expensive to eat out. But we went to a place called Dandelion bar/restaurant almost next door to the hotel. There we had 2 for 1 on meals which was an added bonus. On a saturday night too! The food was lovely and would well recommend that.",5,2010,08,31
204,Wonderful stay,"Booked a two day surprise trip to Dublin for my partner and picked the Fitzwilliam on the strength of the reviews on Tripadvisor.  It didn't disappoint.  Staff and service were courteous and incredibly friendly, from the lady who checked us in, to the concierge and lovely bar staff.  The location is ideal, being right on St Stephen's Green - staggering distance from nightlife, but far enough to get a great night's sleep (which we did).   We booked a standard room, which wasn't huge, but fine for our needs and very tastefully decorated.  The bathroom and shower were lovely.  Lots of nice touches (got to love the tasty chocs that come with the turn down service), very comfortable bed, and free wifi and gym facilities.  We ate out, so I cannot comment on the standard of the food.  Was sad to leave - would definitely stay again. Lovely place.",5,2010,08,26
204,Heavely Service,"We had a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam and besides the fantastic location, the food, our room etc etc, our favourite part was the service and you really do deserve the 5 star rating when it comes to the staff.  We felt so welcome and “nothing” was problem or inconvenience.   It really felt like you only hire staff that love doing what they do and even at the end of a long shift they didn’t even show how tired they were.  Realistically, I know not everyone is in good form from morning to night but I am so glad that it felt like they were.   Thank you all for a wonderful stay,",5,2010,08,24
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin,Dissatisfied with  concierge staff over lost washing. Were not very interested in helping.,4,2010,08,24
204,Very Good Hotel in Superb Location,"We stayed there for three nights twice during a recent trip to Ireland.  For tourists, the location is superb.  Grafton Street and a host of nice restaurants are within an easy walk and St. Stephens Green is across the street.  The hotel is very good, but not spectacular.  The rooms are well done and nicely appointed, perhaps a trifle small.  Lots of closet space for luggage so you can make good use of the space you have.  Bathrooms were very modern and up to American standards for a shower.  The breakfast service, which was included in our room rate, had a lot of variety and ample seating for couples and families.  The clientele seemed to be both American and European.  The number of rooms is larger than I thought from the internet, but it did not seem too crowded.  We had two rooms and we pleased when one of them  was available when we arrived around noon on a Saturday from our overnight flight.  The hotel happily kept our larger bags when we went down to Cork for a couple of nights.   The lobby was not appealing, creates a bad impression, and needs to be rethought, but is not a reason to stay away.  Too many smokers near the open doors kept the entry way unpleasant.  
There may be a couple of nicer hotels in Dublin (although not many), but the location of the Fitzwilliams is among the very best.",4,2010,08,20
204,A 5* hotel which doesn't meet expectations on any front,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights whilst in Dublin on business. The hotel comes across well at first, with a nice large lobby and efficient check-in staff. On being shown to my room, everything appeared to be OK - until I started to look more closely. 

The room (I stayed in a Executive double) is nicely decorated, although the purple carpet makes the room feel smaller than it actually is. The problems arose when I looked at the details. Each room has a light above the door on the outside, but I noticed that the bulb on mine was hanging out of the holder, with wiring exposed. The shaving mirror in the bathroom was broken, so it wouldn't stay in the same place, and the bulb in the desk lamp is so low wattage that it is nearly useless. When I tried on a bathroom robe, I found it had been dried naturally so it was like wearing sandpaper, and the toilet needed flushing twice in order to work. 

The staff are polite and generally helpful, although the turn-down service arrived to turn down my bed at nearly 10pm, which is far too late - especially if you're a family travelling with young children. Turn-down should be somewhere around 7pm - usually when clients are out for dinner so they return to a room prepared for bedtime. 

All these things are minor on their own, but I would've expected a 5* hotel to notice them. Things break in hotels every day, but the mark of a good hotel is that staff notice the issues and they're fixed as quickly as possible. The final straw for me was that there was no hot water available for a shower on the final morning of my stay, which is obviously unacceptable. 

In conclusion - a nice hotel, in a great location but unfortunately not one which fits its 5* billing. If it was a 4* hotel then the problems would be more forgivable, but as its supposed to be one of the best hotels in Dublin they're simply not. I'll be going back to the Westbury!",2,2010,08,19
204,"Quite a great location, service and staff","First time in Dublin.  My wife and I decided to see the city for our 11th anniversary and stayed (based on reviews here) at the Fitzwilliam.  Wasn't expecting to like the hotel as much as we did.  Great location: right on the edge of St. Stephen's Park, adjacent to most of the shopping, cool restaurants, National Museum, etc.   Really did not have to walk far for anything.

The staff was superior.  Sure, there were some people who were slightly less helpful than others, but the majority were excellent -- and really went beyond the call of duty.  They helped us rent a car, get around, make reservations, plan a trip outside the city and a whole bunch of other things that were time-intensive and probably annoying as hell for them.

The restaurant (""Thornton's"") at the hotel is first-rate.  It was expensive (Dublin is an expensive city to eat in, believe it or not) but definitely worth it for the ""event"" of it.  Food was about a 9 out of 10, but the service, again was a 10.

My complaints about the hotel?  The ""Free WiFi"" really did not work in our room (the signal was intermittent and weak) and I had to go to the lobby downstairs to conduct business over the internet.  The gym was kind of small.  Um -- they didn't have any working AC adapters?  And -- that's about all I could muster on the ""cons"" side of it.

It was a wonderful experience.  I really, really enjoyed my stay there.  Highly recommended.",5,2010,08,16
204,Awesome experience,"Arrived there after a delayed red-eye from New York.  Check-in took minutes.  Room wasn't ready so we went upstairs for a delicious Irish breakfast.  A few minutes later the reservation agent came upstairs to find us, give us our keys and let us know that our bags were in the room.  Stayed in a superior king, overlooking St. Stephen's Green.  Surprised to find a small, private terrace with table and chairs which was accessed by climbing out the window!  Room was large as was the bathroom.  Spotlessly clean.  Free wi-fi.  Turndown service.  Poofy, comfortable bed, pillows and blankets. Perfect location.  Delightful short walks to shopping, sites, River Laffy, restaurants and parks.  Will go back to Dublin ASAP and will stay at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2010,08,10
204,well located,"4-star Boutique Hotel. Great location, but in pricey tourist area. Could walk to most places.
Very nice lobby - see photos. 
Small but good room - good bathroom.
WiFi (free BitBuzz) was the most difficult to use compared to hotels in other cities and countries - frustrating! 
Breakfast not included. Instant coffee and tea bags in room. 
Business Center was decent, but no phone in center, so couldn't call from room or lobby to contact friends using business center.
Concierge guys were friendly and well-meaning, but didn't give the best or most efficient advice on several occasions. Portly daytime doorman was very aggressive in grabbing suitcases to place in taxi even though we weren't ready to depart.
That said, for location and cleanliness, a great little hotel!",4,2010,08,08
204,"amazing, fantastic location and staff","Great place, Fantastic staff that really made our stay memorable, there advice was well worth listening to and a trip to the coastal side of Ireland was a fantastic part of our stay.Hotel was in a perfect location for everything.Room was just right and had the lovely park opposite, the bar was sooo expensive ! but everywere is so the toptable site was a lifesaver, £18 for a Burger King snack, £11 for two Guinness in Temple bar, ouch
We ate at the Clarence via top table and this was a massive bargain, compared to everywere else we tried.Top notch service and food with great staff and not at all snooty but  had an air of elegance the food was exeptional and knocked spots of many Michelin starred eateries we have tried",5,2010,08,07
204,Great experience.,"Wonderful hotel. The rooms are beautiful and practial, the breakfast is all you could ask for and the staff is terrific. It is well located in the city.",5,2010,08,03
204,Lovely Room But Not Much Sleep Unfortunately,"Decided on the Fitzwilliam after reading all the positive reviews on this site.  We were not disappointed with our room which was lovely with a gorgeous bathroom.   Bed was really comfy and the sofa bed for the kids was also nice.  The breakfast was lovely and the breakfast room was really bright and nice.  The only problem was the fact that the room was directly over the Cocktail Bar and it was really noisy until 4am in the morning.  It was partly my fault because I asked for a room overlooking St. Stephen's Green not being familiar with the area, actually didn't realise that St. Stephen's Green was across the road and it was likely to be noisy at night.  However I would have appreciate if I had been told as I was booking a family room that it would be noisy by night and perhaps a room at the other side of the hotel would have been better.  Would stay here again and would recommend to friends but would request a quieter room,  we stayed in Room 208.  This would be fine it you had been out partying aswell but not great for a family room and there was constant noise from the people coming and going from the cocktail bar below until 4am in the morning.",4,2010,08,03
204,A perfect spot in a perfect location!,"We spent two nights at the Fitzwilliam and what a perfect place to spend our last two days in Ireland!!  The location is ideal - within easy walking to everything we wanted to see.  Grafton Street was nearly at the doorstep and St Stephen's Green was across the street.
Our room was elegant and very comfortable.  The bed was amazing and there was additional seating for reading the paper and planning the day's outings.  The bath was wonderful - one of the best on our trip!!
I hope to return to Dublin again and will definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2010,07,30
204,Great Staff,"We arrived on an early morning flight from America in Dublin for one night to begin our holiday. Flying to Scotland the next day to tour and eventually attend the  British Open Golf Tournament.  Then returning to Ireland to tour before going back to America. We were quite tired and was told, of course, our room wasn't ready until maybe noon.  The nice lady at the desk insisted we go into the bar and have tea while we waited.  So we did and within 45 minutes she returned with the good news that our room was ready.  It looked exactly like the photos with a large screen tv, window seat and my favorite a beautiful live white orchid.  Very colorful carpet and a lovely lavender button- tufted headboard.  Bed was super comfortable and bath was nice.  After sightseeing and resting we were too tired to go far so had food and wine in the bar which was quite good.  Wish we had more time at this location, there was a mall right next door to the hotel and St. Stephens Green at the front door.  Again, I can't emphasize how helpful everyone was from the bellman to the front desk.  Certainly five star service!",4,2010,07,30
204,Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin- an unforgettable lovely part of my memory,"I was going to Dublin to receive FRCS Without Examination from Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and my children booked me into this hotel - Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin. It became a special part of my memory moreso because I am about to retire this year and receiving FRCS Without Examination was surely an honour for me and for my medical fraternity from RCSI. This hotel, is so well located - hardly seconds or minutes walk from the RCSI on St Stephen's Green. So you can imagine the wonderful morning walks I had for a week at St Stephens' Green and also the comfort of being so close to RCSI.

This hotel is also so close to shopping street - ! Walking. 

One of the most outstanding aspect of this hotel is the genuinely friendly staff. They helped me out of the way, with spending time on my old laptop so that it can work and get connected on their internet, with their warm greetings every morning I went out and offer me an umbrella if weather forecast was for the rain, and trust me, this was a big gift otherwise I would be in trouble with wet passport and money etc. Thank You Fitzwilliam.

The rooms and the decor is really good - very much appreciated. The INTERNET was really good, in all rooms and the lobby, daily breakfast was also very good - and we were spending an hour or two everyday over endless cups of coffee and rounds of food. it was really worth it.

We wish the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin and its team members the best in life, they surely are a special part of our lives,

204,Very friendly staff,"Very friendly staff who actually seemed happy to help, a rarity these days.
Rooms were very well appointed and a reasonable size for a short stay, if you're staying more than a few days you need a larger one than I had (410).

Problem with the WiFi that I didn't have time to resolve but not a big deal for my one night stay.",4,2010,07,25
204,"great location for city centre, great service","Very friendly and efficient service. Lovely to just walk out the door onto Stephens Green and the top of Grafton st. Really enjoyed walking around Dublin city centre. Thorntons is a great restaurant if you've got plenty of money for a five star meal - the surprise menu if you dare!
Not cheap but worth it for the quality.",5,2010,07,24
204,Wonderful Stay,"Luxury hotel at reasonable price. Great service, friendly well informed staff. Our room was in a  softly modern style. My late teens and early twenties children liked the relaxed atmosphere. Our package included a full English breakfast plus buffet. Service in the restaurant was quick and professional. Our package also included a 35 euro credit for the mini-bar, also great with teens. The concierge desk was near the front door and the concierge staff was always available even for little last minute requests for dining suggestions and or directions as we were going out the door (literally). The location is perfect. We were in easy walking distance to the museums, Trinity College, Temple Bar and Grafton street shopping. The lovely St. Stephen Green Park is across the street. Amazingly quiet for the location. returning from a day out was returning home with a fire inthe cozy front lobby and hellos from the staff.  Could not have a better hotel or location was our first trip to Dublin. Hated to leave. Will definitely be back.",5,2010,07,24
204,"Great location, beautiful room, yummy breakfast. Thankyou",Great location for shopping and walking to attractions. Parking was great. The hotel is beautifully decorated and all the staff were very helpful. We only stayed one night on our way to Wexford. We would stay here again.,5,2010,07,21
204,This hotel was a delight after being on the road and staying in B&B's,"The room was small but immaculate and very modern.  The bathroom was huge and the products in it were amazing.  They had a gym which was nice but it was 3 machines and free weights in a windowless room so it was not 100% motivating.  They had communal computers but the internet was down 2 of the 3 days we were there which was a bit annoying since we wanted a place with high speed intenet where we did not have to have our own laptops.  When mentioned to the staff, they didn't seem real concerned about it and their internet worked (which was strange).  The concierge was full of great tips and set up golf anddinner reservations for us.  They all pointed us in the right direction as well in terms of site seeing. The check in process was great and the host showed us to our room which was fabulous.  Housekeeping kept everything very tidy and the chocolates each night were divine.  Can't comment on the restuarants since we didn't eat there.  Good choices, but not the traditional Irish scene that we were looking for.  Would definitely stay there again.  Location was PERFECT.",5,2010,07,15
204,Perfect hotel..,"Stayed here for one night for our wedding anniversary and could not fault the hotel in any way. Rooms were lovely, very clean with turn down service and chocolates etc left in room. We ate in the Citron restuarant and the food was superb and our waiter (didnt catch his name) was absolutely brilliant he was so friendly and attentive, even brought us two glasses of champagne at the end of our meal. 
Location for hotel is brilliant for the city. 
Seriously could not fault this hotel in any way. If your looking to treat yourself for a nite away this is the place to stay",5,2010,07,14
204,"excellent hotel, a bit pricey-but worth it!","this hotel is located directly on st stephen's green, so shopping centre and grafton street are just a stroll away. we had a fabulous room with a balcony over looking stephens green. it was amazing, the room was beautifully decorated with very modern colours. radio and cd player in room, a shower you wouldnt want to get out of! the staff were very helpful and friendly. an excellent hotel to stay in for a special occasion or if you just want to spoil yourself!",5,2010,07,14
204,Better than a Four Seasons,"My wife & i stayed in this amazing hotel recently. I have to say that i have stayed in many Four seasons & Ritz carltons in the US & Europe and this is an amazing property. The staff are immaculate courteous and can not do enough to please their guests. There was a European group staying at the same time and the Hotel staff treated everyone the same 5 * all the way. As a seasoned traveller you look out for these things and staff is my biggest concern as Hotels of this calibre are furnished to excellent standards and that is the expectation. The surprise is when you encounter amazing service with a genuine smile. 
Breakfast was another highlight although busy the Buffet was always pristine great choice of continental & cooked breakfast to cater for all cultures. Again the restaurant manager was very attentive and always ensured that guests were not waiting for a table.
What can i say about the location what a joy to step outside the front door and not need a taxi to go where you want to in the city...It is right at your doorstep also the fact that this hotel has carparking facilities is very welcome from a weary traveller who has just come from a long flight, You simply drive up and the Hotel will valet park for you.
It is worth paying for a park view as this is simply breathtaking as you wake up to hear the birds singing and the wonderful colors from St. Stephen's Green accross from your Guestroom window,you simply forget that your are in the city centre.The park is a fabulous place to go jogging in the morning and most important it is very safe.
The guest rooms are amazing and all have a different decor as i peeked a view into a neighbouring room as i passed by in the corridor i was surprised to see how different the rooms are again a welcome change from the monotony of other Hotel high end brands.
The FitzWilliam in my opinion (from a very critical traveller who never post's comments on these type of travel sites) is the perfect place to combine Business with pleasure as they have all the facilities and more.Did i mention they have Thornton's the best Michelin restaurant in Dublin too.
Congratulations Fitwilliam keep up the fantastic job you are all doing.You have my business any time that i am in Dublin.",5,2010,07,13
204,Dublin Treasure in Decline?,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam on several occasions during the past few years (alone and with my partner) and it quickly became my favorite hotel in Dublin. In a matter of hours during my most recent visit the esteem with which I held this establishment and its staff were shattered. For readability purposes I simply outline my disappointments in four bullets below concluding with the hotel’s too late efforts to make amends and my response.  Readers can gauge for themselves my evaluation.    

(1) The bathroom in room 305 seriously needed a make over, at least a major cleaning.  There was a broken tile.  The shower was dirty with discolored grout between tiles and evidence of mold in several places.  (See attached pictures for what I mean – you be the judge).     

(2) At time of booking (June 9th) I requested a quiet room high above street level. I got an immediate response from the revenue manager informing me that she had assigned me a room on the fifth floor.  I was impressed!  At check in, this assignment was ignored and I was assigned 305 with no explanation.  When I complained later in the day to a receptionist at front desk she informed me, flippantly, that she would make a note of it for my future visits.  To make matters worse, despite my request for a quiet room I was put next to a closet that appears to house electrical or air-conditioning equipment – a constant hum can be heard in my room. I had to run the fan in room 305 constantly to drown out the hum.  I cannot figure out this assignment. 

(3) My mini bar was not re-stocked on the second day (July 10th).  I had to request twice (first from house keeping and second from the front desk) before the water was replaced.  It is unclear why my room was singled out for this as at approximately 3 pm the mini bar replacement person was right outside my room.    

(4) At time of check in I booked a car for 8 am for the morning of my departure.  The porter on duty told me that someone had scheduled my car for ‘quarter to 11.’  Fortunately, he found me a taxi almost immediately.  

I complained to a manager on duty about items 1 and 2 on Saturday morning.  He patiently and professionally listened to my concerns.  My exchange with this manager resulted in a typed and signed apology from the front office manager (Will Woods) in my room that afternoon.  I appreciated this!  The letter offered two items by way of amends.  First, a reduction in my room rate (something I never requested) amounting to 40 euro was provided at checkout.  I declined this as a matter of principle and insisted that the bill be redone.  (When I checked my bill later at Dublin airport I ended up pay 5 euro over the price quoted at time of reservation).  If I wanted a cheaper room I would have found one when I made my reservation. I have no problems paying for quality but expect it to be delivered.  Second, I was offered an automatic upgrade to a fifth floor room at the time of my next booking – I never requested an upgrade in my booking and had paid on June 8th on line for a deluxe room with views of the Green.  I always book a deluxe room.  Perhaps I am missing something but I fail to see how one upgrades from that -- smoke and mirrors I suspect.  

When I check in at a five star hotel any where in the world, I expect five star treatment.  I especially expect that in the US and in my homeland Ireland.  Three star treatment at a five star establishment, that brands itself as the best, is not acceptable.  It is sad to see a great hotel decline, especially one that for several years I rated among the best and recommended to friends around the world. 
A ‘painful case’ indeed!",3,2010,07,11
204,"Perfect location, delightful restaurant, lovely hotel","We stayed for 2 nights in one of the balcony rooms overlooking St Stephen's Green.  The room itself was beautiful with a modern feel, and top-spec fixtures and fittings.  The balcony gave it the wow factor - complete with patio heater, the view of the park beneath was breath-taking.

We found the hotel staff to be ultra professional but also pleasingly friendly - the hotel lobby and lounge were very relaxing. The hotel's unique location means that whilst you have the close proximity of the peaceful and  tranquil St Stephen's Green, you are also just a short walk from the bustling Grafton Street.

We booked a table in the hotel's michelin-starred restaurant, Thorntons.  Although not cheap, the standard of the service and food was as you would expect from a high-end fine dining restaurant.  We tried the 8-course tasting menu, and every course was refined and delicious.

The only thing lacking was a pool and spa, but if you are looking to impress on every other level, then the Fitzwilliam is the perfect choice.",4,2010,07,09
204,relaxed 5 star hotel,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam in July with my husband, 3 year old daughter and my mum. We booked a suite which was perfect for our needs. Seperate sitting room with sofa bed where my mum and daughter slept. lovely master bed room , a hallway seperated the 2 rooms and a nice bathroom off the hall. it was on the 6th floor which was only accessable by stairs (lift up to 5th floor). Staff very polite and attentive carried our bags and buggy up the stairs. The in house hairdressers was very handy, small but adiquate the hairstylist cathy was lovely and did a fab job on my hair. A bit pricey at €45 for a blowdry but it was a treet. Great location for touring Dublin city. Grafton Street, the green all outside front door of hotel. Breakfast lovely and loads to eat. Underground car park very small we brought the car thank god....our longwheel base jeep would never have made the tight turns around the pillars. Totally recommend this hotel .",5,2010,07,09
204,"Great, modern hotel with all the amendities.",The Fitwailliam was the last stop on our 10 day tour of Ireland. The hotel is in a great location and was modern and welcoming. We really enjoyed it!,5,2010,07,06
204,"Lovely hotel, good location but no warm water","Stayed one night in this very central hotel. The room was beautiful with extra touches such as fresh flowers, complimenatary water, chocolates etc. Bed very comfy. 

The water in the shower was luke warm for a while and then very cold. What was a bit of a let down was when I asked about this the receptionist said 'that happens it is best not to shower when everyone else is' - not great for a fairly expensive 5 star hotel.

We were on a dinner inclusive package,  the food  and service in the Citron restaurant was excellent. Breakfast was equally good, but the fresh fruit selection was slightly disappointing.

Overall a very good hotel - but the water situation needs addressed!!!",4,2010,07,04
204,Loved Dublin - Loved the Fitzwilliam,"Absolutely loved your hotel and I don't ofetn give reviews.
The room was fine - although the shower tap needed a good crank to get it going
The bed was sublime - best sleep in the trip by far, and probably the best bed I have slept in for a few months
Your people were great - gorgeous even, from the Concierge, to the catering staff
One day when the kids are off our hands, I'll bring my wife back here",5,2010,07,03
204,"5 Star in every way ~ Service, location, comfort and style :)","I spent 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel with a friend.  It's location is super central wiith St. Stephen's Green opposite the hotel (if you fancy a lovely walk in a park in the heart of Dublin) and yet one of Dublin's best shopping centres, St. Stephen's Green adjacent to the hotel and Grafftan Street just one minute walk away.
We were given a very warm welcome.  The staff are exceptional.  Extremely attentive yet not intrusive.  The Concierge was very helpful.  The hotel itself is beautiful and the bedrooms were spotless and had everything we needed from a 'proper' hairdryer minibar, iron & board, safe, turndown service, complimentary WiFi, complimentary Newspapers, complimentary Ballygowan water in the minibar  to white fluffy bathrobes and slippers!  We ate in the hotel bar for lunch and it was fab.  There is a second restaurant upstairs if you would prefer fine dining.  The hotel is surrounded by lots of excellent eateries, many of which you will need to reserve some time in advance. There is also a Hair Salon (one client at a time in a tiny room which got very warm!!!) and a Beauty Salon.  You won't go far wrong by staying in the Fitzwilliam.  We will be back for sure :)",5,2010,07,01
204,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights in late June 2010. Great location, right at the bottom of Grafton St. Had a great time walking around the city center.
Hotel's concierge was very helpful in making dinner reservations. 

We had an executive double room... was a little on the small side but no complaints. If back in Dublin, we would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,06,29
204,Loved this hotel,"Location was perfect - right on St Stephens Green - most central location for Dublin and within walking distance of all major sites of interest.  Although the room was a bit on the small side, it was immaculate, the bed very comfortable, and it had great amenities - including a CD player, terrific in-room movie selection, and my favorite feature - the step-up-and-out -the-window balcony with the table and chairs for evening sitting looking over the park.  The hotel staff was professional, friendly and helpful.  Bar service and food was terrific.  Overall an outstanding value and a great time.  Highly recommended.",5,2010,06,29
204,"Awesome hotel, perfect location","I picked this hotel mainly for the location.  I had read that Dublin is a very walkable city and that is correct!  This hotel is ideally situated within walking distance to the tourism office on Suffolk St (where you can get day tours out to the the Cliffs of Moher - which we did).  It is directly across from St Stephen's Green, a beautiful park in Dublin.  Grafton St shopping is almost right outside the front door and it is beside the St Stephen's Green shopping mall.  

The hotel itself is spotlessly clean.  When you check in, the staff at the front desk escorts you to your room.  A nice touch!  The rooms are nicely sized - we stayed in the smallest size, and it was plenty of room, especially for a European hotel!  The bathroom is very nice with a rainfall style shower head and lights on a dimmer switch, if you're feeling romantic. ;) Every night there is a turn down service with chocolates left for you.

We ate at Citron most mornings for breakfast.  We always had the buffet which always had the same food so I wasn't that impressed with it.  I didn't try their a la carte breakfast.  We also at at Citron on our first evening and found the food to be excellent.  A couple of nights we ate in the hotel bar.  The food here was also very good.  

As a bonus the internet in the hotel was free (but not wireless).  One minor quibble however - we used the wine glasses in the room, and the maid took one away, and didn't replace it, nor did she ever take away the other dirty one.  So we started drinking wine out of one of the tall glasses - it also got taken away and never returned.  Not sure what was up with that.  

Overall one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at.",5,2010,06,23
204,Ideal location and the most comfy bed ever.,"The Fitzwilliam is perfectly located on St Stephen's Green and very close to the top of Grafton Street. Two minutes walk from great shopping, restaurants and bars. Check in was efficient and the very pleasant staff member brought us to our room which was on the fifth floor. Our executive room is the smallest type available but was more than adequate for the two of us. The furnishings were spotless and very trendy plus the bed and pillows were amazing. We slept like babies!. We didn't eat or drink in the hotel so can't comment on that side of things. Can highly recommend The Fitzwilliam and we will definitely stay here again soon.",5,2010,06,22
204,You might want to avoid the sixth floor.....,"You take an elevator to the 5th, walk a long hall and then walk up a big flight of stairs - not a big deal but if the rooms are the same on the lower floors it would be easier. Otherwise the hotel was great. Perfect central location, we walked everywhere.  The rooms were really nice, beds comfortable and the concierge was great.  We needed restaurants that accommodated vegetarians and they found us some great places.  A very nice place to stay.",4,2010,06,21
204,"lovely, rooms, good food..great staff","came to dublin [ 1st trip]  for the 6 nations rugby match ..wales v ireland.. thought the hotel was modern, rooms were very nice, comfortable , clean and plenty of space...breakfast was very good, lots of choice and freshly made tea and coffee, which was served as soon as you were seated...reception area was particulary nice, and all the staff were most helpful and pleasant, an effeciantly run hotel, the only slight pitfall was the journey into the city centre, a 'liitle' off the beaten track, but would NOT  put me off staying there again ...",4,2010,06,16
204,Great Hotel,Anniversary night in Dublin. Hotel upgraded us to a beautiful room with balcony overlloking St. Stephens Green. Room a four poster. Very Romantic. The welcome note & chocolate coated strawberries a nice touch. ( Thanks Will !)  Best location in Dublin. Everything in walking distance. Underground Parking really convenient. Nice bar. Great service and the best breakfast in Dublin. Having stayed in 15 hotels in Dublin on business in 2 years. The Fitz is the best- dont stay anywhere else.,5,2010,06,12
204,Terrific Hotel,"My spouse and I recently stayed at this hotel and were very impressed with the service and the accommodations. From the moment we checked in the staff were friendly and helpful. The front desk clerk personally accompanied us to our room and showed us all the amenities while the concierge brought our luggage. The room was lovely, with a comfortable king sized bed, high quality linens/towels and even bathrobes and slippers for our use. The decor was modern yet warm. After check in we sought out the concierge for directions and recommendations for dinner and he very quickly provided us with all of the information we needed including several suggestions for restaurants and pubs within walking distance. The lobby area had a fireplace with very comfortable sofas for relaxing and having a quiet drink at the end of the day. On our day of departure, the concierge had pre-arranged a taxi for us to the airport and ensured it was waiting at the door when we finished settling up and checking out.
The location was fabulous being right on the corner of Grafton Street and across from Stephens Green. 
We would highly recommend this hotel - they provided lovely accommodations along with outstanding service and their location was ideal.",5,2010,06,10
204,Brilliant Hotel,"Lovely rooms, great location in walking distance of main attractions. Right opposite St Stephens Green and Tour Bus stop. Lovely extras, great decor and seating area. A wonderful hotel all round.",5,2010,06,01
204,"good location , small rooms","we stayed here for 2 nights in an executive room and found the hotels location excellent. staff again were excellent ,breakfast was good and overall i would stay here again. i found the rooms to be very clean although small....i thought the seating in the room to be a stupid idea.......whats wrong with normal seats ??",4,2010,05,31
204,Disappointing for a five star,"Stayed with a friend for one overnight in a twin room. It was billed as an executive twin but I don't know what the executive part meant! The twin beds were so close together you could not even walk between them. The room was pretty much a standard size from what I could see. Spotlessly clean as you would expect in a five star hotel.
Breakfast was buffet style and nothing to write home about. Certainly nowhere near what I have experienced in other five star hotels and served in a cafe style reastaurant on a mezzanine floor.
Although told I had been  ""upgraded"" to a room with a view of St Stephen's Green, the view was not spectacular and the street noise kept me awake that night.",3,2010,05,31
204,"Nice hotel, let down by heating""","We stayed in a deluxe room, with a balcony overlooking a central garden area.
The room was on the small side, it was billed as a family room and had a sofa bed. I can't imagine how it would have fitted in if the bed had been made up.  The worst problem was the heating.  The room was very cold when we first arrived, and didn't warm up.  They supplied a heated radiator, and said it was needed because it was such cold weather for May.  I'd hate to be there in January.  
There was also no heating at all in the bathroom, not even a heated towel rail.  They said that the heating from the room would spread into the bathroom if we left the door open.
This is supposed to be five star.
On the plus side, all the staff were excellent and the location is good",3,2010,05,30
204,Brilliant Location - For Central Dublin,"Great hotel and locatio, the grown up end of Dublin.  The hotel now supplies dressing gowns and slippers.  I would advise taking out the breakfast option when booking, fantastic food.  Very expensive if you opt to pay for it as an add on, when you arrive.

Buses are just around the corner.  No need to book taxis.  You can walk straight out of the hotel and into the shopping parades.  Would stay at this hotel again.  

If you like a quiet night do not stay in the Temple Bar area, more for the 20 year olds.",5,2010,05,25
204,Wonderful and Easy in Dublin,"I recently returned from a 5 day stay at the Fitzwilliam.  All I can say is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  The ambiance and service is outstanding.  Upon entering the Fitzwilliam you immediately know you are somewhere special.  I only wish I could have fit the bed in my suitcase -- again outstanding.  

Missing Dublin already.  No doubt, we will be back.  Just grand.

Raine",5,2010,05,24
204,A Dublin Jewel,"Excellent staff. Luxurious rooms, extremely comfortable.
Hotel well situated for sightseeing, shopping or just relaxing at St Stephens Green.
Dining facilities very good, with the extra advantage of a wide variety of dining options nearby.
There may be other hotels with more extensive public areas. We did not find this in any way a disadvantage.
Recommended unreservedly.",5,2010,05,23
204,The only hotel I will ever stay at in Dublin,"7 couples arrived at The Fitzwilliam , for the first time, for a 2-night stay.  We were all absolutely delighted with our trendy, clean and quiet rooms. A turndown service with chocolates was provided and the towels were always fresh. Lovely green apples provided on each floor. We ate in the Citron Restaurant at night and the food and service were excellent. All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and our stay was really enjoyable. They also have a very good hairdressing facility which we used. I have stayed in a few different hotels in Dublin but would definitely use this one the next time I go. Perfectly positioned for all attractions and transport. We were delayed for one night because of the ash cloud and were told to stay in the same rooms for an extra night. When we couldn't find out the next day whether we were flying out they extended our checking out time until we were sorted. This was a fine example of a hotel and staff who actually cared about their customers. Very well done Fitzwilliam.",5,2010,05,18
204,Great location. Great staff. Great rooms. Great 'extras'. Great Hotel!!,"This hotel is in the nicest part of Dublin and is right in the middle of all the great shops, pubs and restaurants. It can seem a little pricey but when you stay there you see the value for money. Its great as a one or two night place to spoil yourself and unwind.",5,2010,05,14
204,"Perfect Location, service and rooms!","My husband and the two other couples we were traveling with loved the Fitzwilliam.  We really could not find one thing that we didn't like about this hotel.  Everything was great! 

Location: It is a one minute walk to Grafton Street (good shopping and pubs) and is across the street from a lovely park.

Service: Amazing...so helpful from arrival to depature.  The rooms were clean and very spacious for Europe.  

I always like to stay at different hotels but I can honestly say that if I ever go back to Dublin again I will definitely be staying at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2010,05,10
204,Perfection,"This hotel has everything you could hope for in a luxury hotel - location, ambience, friendliness of staff, beautiful and clean accommodations, amazing food. We had a once in a lifetime experience dining at Thorntons. Expensive yes. Worth it...Breakfast was included in the room rate and it was superb. Alone it would have been worth 25 to 30 Euros. Best deal in town. There is nothing stuffy about the hotel even though it is 5 star. It's fun and lively and bright. You can't beat the location. It is not inexpensive but worth every penny. I can't wait to return...This will be my permanent Dublin hotel if they will have me....American tourist.",5,2010,05,10
204,"Absolutely The Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In!!""","From the minute the front door was opened for us by the Concierge, we were treated like VIP's.  Even the receptionist took us to our room.  The room was absolutely fantastic and always clean.  Turn down service each evening was great.  If we needed ANYTHING, and I mean ANYTHING, all we had to do was call Concierge and it was done immediately.  One of the Concierge employees even went out and got a birthday cake for my husband and brought it up to the room on a tray with candles lit, plates, napkins, and a knife to cut the cake.  Thanks, Victor, you're the BEST!!  Also, thanks to Karl, Anthony and Tony as well as all the other Concierge employees who gave us such great help.  The breakfast served each morning was scrumptious and service was impeccable ... thank you Diana for making breakfast so enjoyable.  We loved our stay and would recommend it to others.  Another plus about staying at the Fitzwilliam was their location to most of the things we wanted to see and do.   Thanks so much for making our stay so enjoyable and thanks to Elena for making our reservation and giving us such a gorgeous room.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.",5,2010,05,08

204,"Excellent Hotel, Breakfast staff let down","We stayed for two nights as part of our wedding anniversary.  The hotel staff upgraded our room for free given the occasion.  The hotel is well situated in Dublin making all the sites and shopping easily accessible.  All hotel staff where very friendly and I found no faults with the hotel or staff accept from one issue.  On the first morning I found the Eastern European breakfast staff very unhelpful, ignorant and arrogant and was disappointed with their service.  On this morning it was a buffet breakfast but I found the staff on duty didn't replenish foods used and I was forced to eat rather a lot of sausages and bread to the point I began to “oink”, all that was left, and I was terrified to speak with these staff members.  I have travelled many countries and stayed in many hotels and  this said it didn't take away from my stay and I would recommend this hotel, and most certainly consider staying again.  The second morning was a lot better owing to a change in staff.  Excellent hotel!!!",4,2010,05,02
204,"Superb Hotel, excellent service and great location","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and could not have chosen a better hotel.  We arrived at 10.30am to a warm welcome and were offered a complimentary coffee while we waited for our room which fortunately was available 30mins later.  It was so nice not to have to wait for the official check-in time.  We were shown to our room which was on the top floor with its own balcony overlooking St Stephen's Green - fantastic.  Other travellers have commented on the rooms being small but ours was not what I would call small and was very comfortable and beautifully furnished.  The breakfast menu was really extensive and set us up well for our day's sightseeing.  We had a delicious dinner in Citron for our actual anniversary where the service was very friendly yet professional.  The location is absolutely perfect for shoppping in the Grafton Street area, catching the tram, picking up the Dublin tour bus or aircoach back to the airport.  We would certainly stay in this hotel in the future and will recommend it to family and friends.",5,2010,04,29
204,"Perfect location, great balcony, very very small room","I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights last week and, while the experience overall was pleasant, there is one major problem... the rooms are some of the smallest I've ever seen and I've stayed in many hotels, even throughout Japan where small rooms are the norm.

I booked a special 'holiday' offer which was for a standard room B&B for two nights with a €25 voucher for food/drink in the hotel.  The offer was tempting and when I contacted the hotel, they said I could upgrade to a superior room with a balcony for the reduced rate of €15 per night.  I was certain that I had a great deal. 

On arrival at the hotel, my car was taken by concierge and the check in process was prompt and smooth.  We were shown to our room, which was nicely decorated but I was pretty shocked at how small it was.  It has to be said, this room is saved by the balcony over St. Stephens Green.  It is fabulous to be so central and to have a balcony over the green.  The balconies are not private however.  There is no partition, apart from a railing, between them and if your neighbours are out, you have no privacy whatsoever.

The room itself is well thought out for the space, but it is not a 5 star size.  The bed was tiny for two people and there was very little space around it.  I had to use the ironing board at one stage but decided against as I didn't have space to open it when my luggage was on the floor.  When someone was sitting at the desk, the other person has to climb over the bed to get across the room.  However, I do like the colours, the furniture, the linen, the towels etc.  It is let down by the size, nothing else.  Also, we were put in the room beside the lift.  I didn't complain but I was woken up a few times during the night.  It doesn't help that the bed was too small!

The breakfast was fine but nothing amazing.  The bar was quiet when we were there so only ended up using the €25 on two cocktails and then leaving as there was not much atmosphere.  Overall, it's perfect for a two night stay.  A lot of thought has gone into the design of the room and the hotel, but if it's for a longer stay it is not big enough.",4,2010,04,12
204,Very nice hotel - maybe 4 star instead of 5,"Stayed two times at this hotel, and enjoyed both stayes - though I find it hard to understand why they are 5 star as I have stayed at 4 star hotels in Dublin which certainly beats this one.

Positive:
Very quiet rooms
Nice bathroom
Great location
Nice historic building

Negative:
Mediocore breakfast (below standard for a 4 star hotel)
Nothing that made me go ""wauv""
Not as good as the other business hotel in Dublin I stayed at",4,2010,04,12
204,The right hotel in Dublin,Visited Dublin for Easter and stayed at Fitzwilliam Hotel. Stylish and very good service. Friendly staff and perfect location,5,2010,04,08
204,A great location and base in Dublin,"This hotel was in the heart of town, opposite the beatiful gardens in the heart of town.
Everything was is easy walking distance as were excellent restuarants and bars of a high standard.
The room was confortable, clean but on the small side. I guess this is consistent with European experiences.
Breakfast was good.
The facilities- bathroom, comfort of bed - all met our expectations. A very comfortable base from which to explore a great city - we only wish we had more time.",4,2010,04,01
204,Lovely Hotel but Rather Smelly!,"The Fitzwilliam is a great hotel with excellent staff, fab rooms with comfy beds and good food.

Our only surprising disappointment was that there was a terrible smell in the bar/lobby area as well as near the lifts.  It smelt like a damp sewagey smell - very unpleasant and put a little bit of a downer on the hotel for us.  Luckily however you couldn't smell it in our room.

Another reviewer has commented on this too, so I am not sure it is just a one off - the hotel needs to sort it out as it wasn't cheap and not expected of a 5 star hotel!!  I would have loved to give them a 5 star for their service alone, but feel I have to give a three because of the pong!",3,2010,03,30
204,Wonderful Stay,my husband & 2 children stayed @ the Fitzwilliam from March 13-19 & was an absolute wonderful stay! The rooms were on the small size yet very clean & the beds very comfy.. Breakfast was included & was a great way to start the day(service was great)The location was amazing!!rooms overlooked St.Stephans Green(lovely sight) minutes away from all the sight & shopping.The only negative thing was on sat night it was rather loud outside till about 3:00am(there is a tram just outside the hotel) I would stay @ this hotel again...,5,2010,03,29
204,Amazing Location,"Great hotel, amazing location. could not fault it, will definately stay again. expensive but worth every penny. great for a treat!",4,2010,03,29
204,"Good Location, Good Facilities, Great Staff","I have been using the facilities of the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a number of years, for both leisure and business/

The booths in the back bar are a best kept secret if you are looking for a quiet corner to have a meeting.

Food in the bar is really good, service fast and the staff there are genuinely nice.

The underground car park is handy as well and there is always a spot there whatever the time and the parking charges are reasonable.

For accommodation, rooms are really, really comfortable with every luxury, including bathrobes and nice toiletries.

Accommodation a bit pricy if you are on a budget as they haven't gone down the route of too much budgeting, but then that means that the quality is still high.

Try for a room over looking Stephen's Green, rather than room overlooking their courtyard/garden.

Location is brilliant as well as you are right in the heart of everything.

Only minus is that I can never seem to get connected to the wifi in the bar, which is annoying!!",4,2010,03,28
204,Great rooms in a great location,"Stayed one night, wish it could have been for longer, room extremely comfortable and the welcome and service top class. I'll be back again in a few weeks and will be sure to stay here again. Car park is very reasonably priced and the location is just fantastic. Would highly recommend to all and sundry.",5,2010,03,22
204,Good start but disappointing overall,"Having arrived at the hotel before 10.30am we were very impressed with the efficiency of check-in and were immediately shown to our room. The room was small but over looked the green so again we were pleased. 

The disappointment arose due to the dreadful smell in the lobby, bar and lift areas. The smell was so strong in the bar that we were forced to leave our table and have a drink in the foyer. This however did not solve the problem as the smell was also present here and the scented nightlights on the tables did not mask the odour. 

Our room was near the lifts and the noise from the lifts coupled with the noise from St Stephens Green on a Saturday night did not lead to a restful night. The fact that the room was extremely warm even with air conditioning also resulted in an uncomfortable night.

Check-out was again efficient and the concierge staff helpful with our luggage. 

The reception and concierge staff were certainly very professional and the location excellent but I would find it difficult to recommend the hotel due to the other difficulties we encountered.",3,2010,03,22
204,"Superb location, great room, extremely comfortable bed!",Great location in the centre of the city. Best hotel bed I have ever slept in. Free broadband was a nice touch and the room was superb!,5,2010,03,14
204,"Luxury, wonderful staff, great service and the best breakfast.","Stayed here and the location was brilliant for shopping as just a short walk from Grafton Street, also great for the famous Temple Bar area as this is about a 15 min walk away.  The bed was so comfortable I had to write down the make because i want one, the bedding was  quality bedding, the roll top bath that i soaked in with my partner was massive and the rooms have candles and a CD player that allows you to switch on the speaker facility in the bathroom.  This hotel is ideal for a romantic time, the attention to detail throughout the hotel is lovely.  The breakfast is so good that i when I just thought about it, my mouth started watering.  I am a vegetarian and I was impressed, also if you like porridge you have to try it here.",5,2010,03,13
204,"Great Location , Hard to fault","Dependent on what you want this is an ideal hotel for a short city break. Its modern, comfortable , spotless and stylish. Location at the top of Grafton St and by the park is its undoubted selling point. A bit anonymous as a lot of these big city hotels make you feel if you know what I mean. Get a decent deal and I would definitley recommend",4,2010,03,03
204,"Beautiful rooms, perfect location, great staff","Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Fitzwilliam. We were shown to a beautiful room on arrival. All the staff were so friendly and helpful. The room decor was beautiful, 4 poster bed, great little balcony overlooking St Stephens Green. The location was perfect, right beside Grafton St so we could walk everywhere. Ate in Thorntons as part of the package on one night. I enjoyed my meal but the other half wasn't that impressed and thought portion sizes were too small. Couldn't fault our stay, really well run hotel and the staff, decor and location really made it a special stay.",5,2010,03,03
204,"This was a fab hotel, perfect location and excellent staff..","I would def recommend this hotel for its location and elegance. It is a bit pricey but def worth it for a special occasion. Fab decor. We didnt eat in the hotel, so not sure there",4,2010,03,02

204,Irish hospitality at its best.,Location is superb. Rooms large and spacious. Service and genuine helpfulness of staff truly impressive. Have nothing negative to say. Breakfast is very good. You can't go wrong with this property.,5,2010,02,21
204,Romantic rooms in a stunning location,"Stayed here in February 2010, really worth paying the extra for a room overlooking St Stephens Green.  As a tip I would get a room on the 3rd floor in the winter and a room on the 4th floor in the summer - 3rd floor does not have a balcony but has 1.5 metre extra room space for armchairs with a spectacular view over the green where-as 4th floor has smaller rooms but a balcony.  Beds were very comfortable with a modern 4-poster look and bath was amazing.  If I had one gripe it would be that the concierge/doormen were not very attenitve - rarely anyone opening the door for you and recommendation for lunch seemed to be with little thought for what we were after, but thats a minor quibble against a fantastic stay.",5,2010,02,18
204,superb,use everything they have its a dream. pleaseure to go there and would go again,5,2010,02,16
204,Fantastic,"This hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in in Ireland. Everything in this hotel is of the highest Quality, From service to the carpet on the floor, Robes, Minibar ETC and you dont have to remortgage the house to stay here. My wife and I have started going to dublin a couple of times a year and we will be making this our stop all the time.",5,2010,02,16
204,Its just fantastic,"Just had a super weekend break with me and boyfriend we checked in saturday afternoon we were mate by a lovely irish receptionist which is really rare the girl who is Maria she room us which we didnt expect she told us about the hotel and the break down of the facilites would have loved to have gone to the treatment rooms but time was on our hands :( we then asked her about were to go for drinks after dinner and she gave great advise it was so nice meeting a bubbley person like that she really made us feel welcome . once we are in the room she told us water was comp which is real nice touch . The only down fall which is not really a down fall was breskfast sunday morning it took longer then we hoped once it came to the room it was fab .The late check out was so nice would have liked to personally have thanked Maria but she was with a guest 
Thank you so much will be back !",5,2010,02,15
204,Very Special,"Six of us booked in for the Valentines Special, and it was indeed very special. Location is excellent, a stones throw from St Stephens Green and Shopping Centre. From the minute you arrive, you receive a very warm welcome from the concierge who looks after parking your car, delivering your luggage to the room. The reception staff were very professional and friendly . I dont have anything against foreign staff, but we all remarked how lovely it was to experience the traditional Irish welcome and chat. The rooms were on the fourth floor overlooking St Stephens green . Soft music playing, a chilled bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries were all part of the valentines special. The rooms were very well equipped , and really comfortable, if a little small. The bathroom was excellent - really warm and cosy, with fantastic products, towels and bathrobes and slippers. We dined in the Citroen restaurant - the meal was excellent and included a complimentary glass of Prosecco. Part of the valentines special was a complimentary 'love potion' cocktail which we chose to have l after our meal sitting at the fire in the foyer - (there was no problem in changing the cocktail for an Irish Coffee). Returned to our rooms to the chocolates from the turn down service, where they had also replaced  any wet towels and removed the empty ice bucket and champagne bottle. Complimentary chilled water was included in the mini bar.  Breakfast was again served in the Citron restaurant - a very good array of freshfruit, cereals, porridge, cheeses, smoked salmon, croissants, bread and pastries and good strong coffee.. It was so refreshing to have a cooked breakfast cooked to order instead of a  self service buffet style breakfast. Sraff were attentive and professional. Fresh tea/coffee and new cups were offered making breakfast a long relaxed enjoyable start to the day. Late check out of 12.00 and a lovely dry sunny morning meant that we all availed of the balcony table and cushioned chairs in our rooms to sit and read our complimentary newspapers. It would have been lovely to have stayed another night to have had time to visit the gym, and beauty salon, On checkout we simply left our luggage with the concierge who returned it to the car, whilst we all went for a stroll around Dublin, availing of the secure carparking which just cost E10 - a real bargain by Dublin prices.  A first class experience - and highly recommended.",5,2010,02,15
204,I'll be back,"Central location and great quality.  Rooms were very clean, bed comfy and service was friendly and professional.",5,2010,02,01
204,Splendid,"I had a memorable stay at the Fitzwilliam . Situated in the shopping district of Dublin,  it was extremely convenient to move out and enter Grafton Street in a jiffy.  The staff was very courteous, warm and helpful.  The beds were one of the best that I have slept in and given the choice I would love to visit Dublin and stay at the Fitzwilliam again.  Thanks a ton for making my stay worthwhile and memorable.",4,2010,01,26
204,Lovely contemperary Hotel.,"Right location in the heart of the shopping and club district.
Even given this, the rooms are whisper quite.
Parking, secure and at a fixed rate.
Will stay again.",4,2010,01,25
204,Wonderful Location,"I don't think there could be a better located hotel in Dublin. St. Stephen's Green is directly across the street and we could see it from our balcony. The shopping mall is almost next door and Grafton St. is just steps away.
The hotel room was beautiful. We had a four poster bed, a balcony with a view of the Green, and a great bathroom. The service was great and the breakfast was good. We were given a wonderful recommendation for dinner, arranged taxis for us and were quite kind.
We were there for Halloween night and joined the partying down Grafton St. and Temple Bar. We took one of those pedicabs and did some sightseeing of the great costumes and party goers.
You can't go wrong staying here. It was terrific.",5,2010,01,20
204,Unparalled level of service,"Although the room decor might be a bit bland, the level of service and attentiveness of the staff would be difficult to find elsewhere.  The room was comfortable and quiet. Coffee and tea service in the room as well as complimentary mineral waters were greatly appreciated. Next to Stephen's Green, Grafton and easy walking distance to the National  Concert Hall, the  Abbey and the major attractions of Dublin make this an especially desirable hotel.",5,2010,01,19
204,"Highly recommend the Fitzwilliam hotel, Great location!","Would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam hotel to others travelling to Dublin is centrally located, walking distance to all amenities we had a fantastic long weekend, after having an 8hour delay at newcastle airport on arrival to Fitzwilliam was all worthwhile hotel is fantastic staff were very helpfull overall great experience!",5,2010,01,06
204,Great Hotel in Fantastic Location,"I've stayed in the Fitzwilliam a few times now, and each time it has been superb.  The rooms are a good size, nicely decorated, and with very comfortable beds, and generous sized bathrooms.  The service is excellent, and unobtrusive.  The room rates are excellent for such a conveniently located hotel, and the bar is very comfortable to relax in as well.  It's always a pleasure to stay in this hotel.",5,2010,01,05
204,Keep this a secret..................,"I did not know what to expect but it was fantastic , the location at the top of Grafton Street is just where you want a hotel to be, I parked the car for the three days and walked. The room was overlooking Stephens Green the housekeeping staff did a magnificent job with turndown etc. The staff could not help enough with bookings for eateries and put confirmations in the room . A wonderful secret in the heart of Dublin that I hope remains just that so I can get a booking when I want.......................

PS . We got lost and met a staff member on the 5th floor who helped us but also gave us the guided tour of the penthouse !! WOW",5,2010,01,04

204,Perfect location,"This hotel is slap bang in the middle of Dublin so you are right in the action when staying here. The staff are super helpful and the concierge sorted our New Year's Eve night out before we arrived and it all went off without a hitch. The rooms are not big but they are modern and have everything you need or would expect.
When I go back to Dublin I will stay there again - there is no need to look anywhere else.",5,2010,01,01
204,A Hilton with a Conrad touch! Comfortable but NOT charming.,"Do not expect anything charming or quaint, the hotel is very much like a Hilton... with the Conran touch!
 Well-located but the hotel is squeezed betweeen a bank and a T.G.I Friday's, so definitely not in the most appealing part of St Stephen's Green...

Our room was very comfortable though and we liked its decoration. 
Nice bathrooms.
 
Service could be improved, we had to call twice to get an adaptor and the complimentary water was never provided although we asked for it.

Good breakfast at Citron, but avoid the restaurant, the food is not quite up to the mark for the restaurant of a supposedly 5 star hotel .",3,2009,12,30
204,A great hotel in a great location with great service.,"We stayed here over Christmas and were delighted. It is only a 1 minute walk to Grafton Street, everyone was very helpful and friendly. What more can I say. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2009,12,29
204,The difference is....... the concierge.............,A great experience. the difference was the services of the concierge. Nothing was the too much trouble for them any any even slight delay was explained. We will be back,5,2009,12,21
204,The Perfect Hotel in the Perfect Location,"The Fitzwilliam is an inviting, elegant hotel without being stuffy. The staff was very helpful when we were trying to phone our daughter without success. The purple, gold & green color scheme was beautifully done and even carried over to the Christmas decorations. The location, right across the street from St. Stephens Green and steps away from Grafton Street made it the ideal place to see Dublin on foot. Every detail was perfect, between the comfortable bedding, full size hair blower, two umbrellas to use and delicious chocolates on the pillow. Our only complaint was that we were sold tickets to a Hop On Hop Off company that wasn't in operation during Dec. (We were able to exchange them), Also, if breakfast was included, we were not told this,",5,2009,12,20
204,Great Hotel - Great Location,"We were staying in Dublin to attend a concert and so spent a couple of nights in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Excellent hotel and excellent location, right in the centre great for shopping!

Would definitely stay here again on any future trips to Dublin.",4,2009,12,19
204,Trendy Hotel on the Green,"The Fitzwilliam has a very good reputation which can be a difficult thing to live up to but I must say that I enjoyed a very nice stay in the Fitzwilliam on a recent Business trip.

Dublin is usually my last stop after a week long swing through Europe. Once I arrive in Dublin and at your hotel there is a sense of comfort and relief.

Thanks again for a pleasant stay.

204,Purple Paradise,"When I booked the Fitzwilliam it had been rated quite highly on this site.  There were others ahead of it so my expectations were that it would be ok.  All I can say is that I was very pleasantly surprised by what I found.  The hotel foyer is beautiful, with lots of comfy sofas & chairs in front of a fire.  All of the rooms have been designed by Terence Conran and are absolutely lovely. The hotel supply toweling bathrobes and slippers.  The amenities include, an iron, a trouser press, a good quality hair dryer, a CD player and a flat screen tv.  In fact the room was so nice I didn't want to leave it!
The location is perfect also, being directly opposite St Stephen's Green at the top of Grafton Street.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2009,12,11
204,5 STAR AT ITS BEST !,"An absolute haven, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, we were struck by the truly  open and genuine warmth of all the staff, who were  extremely friendly and very attentive, from Kathyrn who looked after our reservation, and Sorcha in reception.
 Our deluxe room was luxurious and most comfortable,with attention to detail.
  The food was second to none, deliciously tasty  and fresh with the best of local produce. The service was outstanding Jean (french waiter) who contributed immensely to our dining experience on both nights in the Citron restaurant.
We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and we look forward to a return visit.",5,2009,12,03
204,"Fantastic location, perfect first trip to Dublin","For my first trip to Ireland, i was very lucky. You can only tell so much from the internet when you are booking a hotel. Luckily, the Fitzwilliam was in the perfect location. My boyfriend & I were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go from the hotel. The location alone was worth it. 
  the hotel itself was great. the service was friendly & knowledgeable. our room wasnt large, but it was bigger than i expected for my first European hotel room. the bed was comfortable, TV was new, garden view was lovely & the bathroom fantastic. We didnt have any problems with noise like some of the reviews I've read. We did however have a hard time with the hot water in the shower, it was a bit temperamental but was figured out.
  We had dinner one night at Thornton's & it was delicious. i very highly recommend having dinner there during your stay. Absolutely yummy.
 Overall, it was a fabulous stay. I must admit i was a little worried, with the price we paid for our room i was afraid it wouldnt be up to my expectations. i have never been to Europe, but I have been to South America & Asia enough to know that you usually need to pay much more internationally than you would in the states for the same service. However, the Fitzwilliam was a wonderful exception. It was a fantastic experience & i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",4,2009,12,01
204,Great stay in Dublin,"This hotel is in a brilliant location in a nice part of Dublin.  The room was lovely - very funky but also functional.  We loved the window seats - this was a nice touch.  The room was starting to look ever so slightly tired around the edges - a few bumps here and there but nothing major and I'm sure they will keep on top of this.   The bed was heavenly - very comfortable - and the room very well equipped (although slippers would have been the icing on the cake!) 

The things we didn't like so much were: 
1.  The safe locks using your room key - I have not encountered this before but felt it was not that secure - surely that means it can be accessed by anyone who has a room key card?! 
2.  There is noticeable noise penetration from the corridor - I don't know whether the doors could be better insulated to reduce this.   The cleaning staff were not particularly noisy but we did find this noise disturbed us in the morning.   We used the aircon and found the hum from that (which was not at all disturbing) quite effectively muffled the noise from the corridor.  Otherwise the room was very quiet. 

We ate in all three of the restaurants - Thorntons, Citron and the bar.  Thorntons was simply amazing and well worth a splurge if you can make it there during your stay.   Breakfast in Citron was very impressive - everything worked like clockwork, the food was excellent and even when it got very busy the staff seemed completely unfazed.   The service was very good - you didn't need to ask for things that were missing, they just appeared before you noticed their absence.   The bar was also a great place to hang out  at any time of day - and did very nice food as well. 

Overall, a great stay and we would definitely go back!",4,2009,11,17
204,Fab but...,"Stayed here with my husband for 2 nights. Great impressive lobby with open fire. Rooms modern, spacious and clean. Fab 4 poster bed with chocolates delivered every night, amazing outside balcony with table and chairs looking onto St Stephen's Green, lovely bar and staff and marble bathroom.

Fab apart from noisy cleaners in the morning which was the only thing that let it down!",5,2009,11,13
204,Fabulous!,"We had a wonderful time on our honeymoon in Ireland.  I would strongly encourage everyone to consider staying at the Fitzwilliam.  The hotel is ideal for a central location.  The staff was very helpful.  Day and night we were able to ask questions about trips out into the countryside.  The hotel was easy to navigate from when we would take day trips out into the city for shopping or to see tourist destinations.  The food in the restaurants at the hotel was reasonably priced.  Thank you especially to the concierge staff, Tony, Tony, Bud and Bob. And Joanna in Reservations!",5,2009,11,11
204,What a nice treat!,"Loved this hotel.  The rooms are divine, the bathroom huge and the amenities very plush.  The location was perfect for shopping, sightseeing and partying.  The breakfast was GREAT!! And who doesn’t like chocolates before going to bed??",5,2009,11,05
204,wow,"fantastic hotel, plush rooms with attention to every detail, yummy breakfast. Great location",5,2009,11,04
204,Perfect Location and service,"We have stayed a few times over the years in the Fitzwilliam and I must say each stay is a treat.  Staff have always been courteous and very helpful from check in to check out.  Nothing is too much trouble. The rooms while some can be a bit on the small side - but this is what you expect from a city centre hotel - are all beautifully decorated, space is very cleverly used.  Bathrooms are a good size and the showers are fab! On our last stay we stayed on the 5th floor in the rooms over looking Stephens Green.  the views were amazing!  you could look out over Stephens Green from the bed it was fabulous.  there was a sizeable balcony where you could sit out and each balcony had its own patio heater. unfortunately it rained quite a bit while we were there so we didn't get to use it as much as we would have liked.  The one thing with the balcony is you have to step up to go out the very large windows ( almost the height of a sliding door so only a slight stoop is needed ).  The beds are incredibly comfortable.  The bar is lovely and peaceful during the day if you need refuge from the madness of Grafton Street - or just to stay away from the temptation of all that shopping!  The location in my opinion can not be beaten.  We went out both nights and it was lovely to have such a short stroll back to our beds.  It is my top preference for hotels in Dublin City.",5,2009,11,04
204,Did not live up to expectations,"I chose this hotel after reading many reviews. My husband and I were with my mother in law, who was 80 years old and although spry, her feet aren't what they used to be. We wanted to be close to everything and wanted a hotel with nice amenities. We are all non smokers and had non smoking rooms. The 1st problem was that although the rooms were non smoking they had to been smoking at one time and stunk of smoke. I think it was in the wood and linens. I complained and they offered to move me to another room but  on a smoking floor. 
 Then there was the toilet problem. Our toilet broke at 4 am. In the morning they said they would fix it but when we got back that night it hadn't been touched. Maybe a language problem with the concierge? They offered us a drink in the lounge while they fixed it. That night once again it broke in the middle of the night, it was fixed the next morning only to have a different problem later that day.
The other problem was the morning breakfast. We chose not to have the buffett as we are not that big eaters. Instead we chose to eat off the menu which had prices under the section we were ordering from. We each got an egg dish. When we got our bill to check out we were charged for the buffet both days. Our waiter either was too busy to listen or explain to us how their restaurant worked. We did get a credit for this and also a credit for the toile t issue but overall it was a bad experience. In this economy why the manager wasn't contacting us to change our room or otheriwse make it up to us is beyond me. 
I hope to return to Ireland some day but will not return to The Fitzwilliam again.",2,2009,11,03
204,Great Stay in a lovely hotel,"We stayed in a standard room which was just lovely.  Spotless, comforatable, lovely touches like fresh flowers and tealights and apples everywhere.  Location is second to none and staff were very friendly but not pushy.  Ate dinner in Citron which was very nice, lovely waiter.  Breakfast was great but I'd indulged a little the night before as we were in town for a party so unfortunately couldn't manage the hearty  fare.  All in all I would recommend the Fitzwilliam highly.",5,2009,11,03
204,Excellent service and location,"Very happy with all the staff.  Room was stylish and comfortable with better water pressure in the shower than any other hotel we have stayed in Ireland.  Only wish was similar to all other hotels is that the temperature of the room could not be controlled and was a bit warm for our tastes.  There was a problem with noise in the next room the first night that was addressed quickly by the manager.
Definitely will repeat on our next trip to Dublin and I was interested to see that the same firm owns the resort in Ojai, CA, a site that I travel to each June.",4,2009,11,02
204,The most relaxing and thoughful Hotel we've ever had the pleaure to stay at,"From the moment of booking to the minute we checked out the hotel staff were totally brilliant. The room was fabulous with every small detail thought of. From daily papers to sweets at turn down service, we felt like royalty for the duration of our stay. The really touching moment was when they delivered a bag of goodies to the room for my partner for participating in the Dublin City Marathon, immediately after the run they had a congratulations board in the lobby for all the marathon runners, its the small details like this that made our stay feel extra special.
We stayed in a 5 star in the city before but I have to say The Fitzwilliam went that extra mile to ensure we felt like royalty from start to finish.
Thank you all for making our stay truly memorable and most enjoyable.",5,2009,10,29
204,Creating the Perfect Travel Experience,"We truly enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam. The staff was more than courteous -- they were all cordial and offered wonderful tips about what to do and see in Dublin. The hotel is beautiful and the location is probably the best in dublin for foreign travelers. We would highly recommend this hotel to all travelers, especially those who (like us) hadn't experienced the joys of Dublin before.",5,2009,10,26
204,What a pity about the food,"Great hotel but the evening meal was over priced and was of a limited standard, not what I would expect of a 5* hotel. Would not eat there again.

Rooms very good but TV reception not great",4,2009,10,23
204,Chic and Modern Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam isn't short on style, and while at some trendy hotels style seem to come before service, that wasn't the case here: The entire staff was exceedingly helpful and responsive. We had a problem with our door---it wouldn't lock behind us---and within minutes, they were correcting the problem.

Location was perfect, just on the south end of Grafton Street and on the NW corner of St. Stephen's Green, so it was easy to walk anywhere and everywhere we wanted to go. In spite of the great location, our room was quiet---we weren't kept awake by drunken revelers until the wee hours of morning (although there's no saying that we weren't keeping any others awake, being drunken revelers ourselves!). 

Rooms are small but impeccably styled---great colors, RIDICULOUSLY comfortable beds, flat-screen TVs, etc. If you're the kind of person who notices this thing, check out their hotel info cards---you know, the info usually in a leather portfolio that tells you about room service, the fitness center, etc. The Fitzwilliam had incredibly cool ones---testament to their great style.

My only real complaint was the water---being an old building in Europe, the temperature could be a bit erratic and I'd go between freezing and burning myself. Given the rest of the hotel and all its plusses, however, I figured I could put up with wonky water for five minutes a day.",4,2009,10,21
204,"Great Hotel, wonderful location",We really enjoyed our stay.  Our room was bright and well furnished. Our dinner in the hotel restaurant was excellent.  We loved the location right on St. Stephen's Green.,5,2009,10,18
204,Perfect modern comfort in Dublin,"The Fitzwilliam hotel is a wonderful hotel in a great location in Dublin. The hotel is stylish and modern, with lots of small touches that add to the feeling of luxury and retreat. Though located right in the heart of the bustling Grafton Street / St Stephen's Green area -- convenient to shopping, restaurants and just a short walk from Temple Bar -- the hotel itself and the rooms are very quiet. The bed was truly the best one I have slept in in many trips to Europe! The bathroom is magnificent and luxurious. Lots of storage and closet space throughout the room. My experience could not have been better!",5,2009,10,09
204,Lovely hotel in a fabulous location,"The Fitzwilliam is lovely and the location is fabulous. It is a stones throw from Grafton Street, overlooks the St Stephen's Green park, and has the Luas (tram) stop right in front of the entrance. Our room was a deluxe family room. It was lovely, spacious, with an extra pull out sofa bed and a cot for our children. The bathroom was lovely too. The room overlooked the courtyard, and was quiet. Good for children. The breakfast was excellent with a good choice. Again, child friendly, And the children were offered a paper bag of stale bread to feed the ducks in the park each morning. We enjoyed the hotel bar in the evenings.",5,2009,10,06
204,Marvelous hotel right on St. Stevens Green at top of Grafton Street,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel on an Odysseys-Unlimited tour of Ireland - we arranged our own air and came in a day early.  When we arrived about 9:30 AM the front desk manager offered us immediate accommodation in a twin-bedded room or a short wait till the king bed room we had reserved became available - we opted to wait and had a very nice breakfast just down Grafton Street (Dublin’s main shopping street) at Brewleys Cafe, a Dublin landmark, while we waited.  Upon our return, we were soon shown to a very modern, very clean room where an extra luggage rack and electric adapter were quickly supplied.  Later, the outstanding concierge staff directed us to a very nice nearby restaurant where we enjoyed a good meal at what initially seemed a high price, but now realize was quite reasonable - prices in western Europe are high, folks, and the dollar is weak, so be ready for it if you decide to go.  

Our whole stay at the Fitzwilliam was like the first day, with the delightful concierge-doorman-porter Tony taking wonderful care of us, even getting the kitchen to make my wife onion soup on short notice when we returned from a tour later in the week, and she had a urge for it with their wonderful soda bread and some delightful white wine.  The included breakfasts were complete and wonderful - a buffet with breads, rolls, and pastries, fruit, cold meats and other local specialties backed by a full Irish breakfast menu to order from the kitchen.  No hot food slowly becoming overcooked while it waits to be taken here.  This is truly a great hotel in a lovely city, and we would definitely stay there again if (when?) we return.",5,2009,10,05
204,Great location and very friendly staff.,"Traveled with 3 others. One person was in a wheelchair. When we arrived the manager showed us the different rooms so we could pick out the best wheelchair accessible room.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Location is excellent, convenient to everything. Car parking was easy and very affordable. Would recommend this hotel to anyone. Added to a great time in Ireland.",5,2009,10,03
204,"Great Accommodation, Great Location","This was a great hotel to stay in.  It is right across from St. Stephan's Green, diagonal from the shopping on Grafton Street and not far from the river Liffey.  We did not eat in the restaurant but room service food was excellent.  It is also next to a bar/restaurant called the Dandelion that had live music and a fun atmosphere.  One thing I did not expect was the walkability of Dublin.  If you are looking for good traditional pub food O'Neill's by the Tourist Center had great food.",4,2009,09,30
204,VERY noisy!!!!,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights to attend a conference at the end of a month long vacation in England/Ireland.  It was not our choice since The Shelbourne had filled up and the conference put the spillover in the Fitzwilliam.  While it was a nice hotel, similar to a W, it was the noisiest hotel of all 8 I had been in over the last four weeks. A real big disappointment as well as frustrating.  We upgraded our conference booking to a very nice deluxe room (308) overlooking St. Stephen's Green. The other two grades below are extremely small.  Unfortunately there is a bar below that has bands and loud drunk college students hanging out until anywhere between 2-4 am.  In addition to that, the doors to the rooms slam louder than any hotel door I have ever encountered.  Our room actually shook. They really need to find a way to remedy this.  I am not exaggerating when I say that we got a total of about 3 hours of sleep each night.  It was a horrible way to end such a wonderful holiday.  Beyond all this (and my 17 Euro glass of flat champagne in the bar), the hotel is nice.  I'm sure there must be some quieter rooms.  Just don't stay in 308 or anywhere near it.",3,2009,09,27
204,Top Class,"Without a doubt one of the best hotels in Dublin. Second time staying here and both very enjoyable. Stayed Sunday of All Ireland and room was ready at 11am as requested. Service efficient and friendly. Valet parking very handy. Basic room was bright and comfortable. Nice bathroom, bath a bit high to enter easily. Might be difficult for some people. Ate  at Citron, early bird was great value. Food and service top notch. Have eaten in Thortons before, best food in Dublin. Nice buzz in bar and great cocktails. All in all, great stay. Would recommend.",5,2009,09,26
204,"Very convenient, a lovely hotel","The great location of the Fitzwilliam, at the top of Grafton Street and on St Stephen's Green, makes it a so convenient for shopping, nightlife, sightseeing, just about everything.  Unfortunately, upon check-in I was given a lower category room than the one I had booked, and no explanation of this was provided to me.  When I questioned it a day later (I noticed I did not have the promised ""view of St Stephen's Green"" or the Chartruese bath!) I had to waste some time getting it resolved in order to get my rate revised down accordingly.  Other than that it was everythign you would expect from a quality hotel.  In particular, the concierge was very helpful.  I would definitely stay again.",4,2009,09,26
204,Loved the Room - Comfortable and Serene,"My husband and I stayed three nights on the third floor in an Executive Double.  I thought the room was perfect for jet lag recovery - Quiet and Serene and Soothing.  I loved the H20 toiletries - the scent was so refreshing and clean - I'm going to buy some for home.  Lots of channels on the TV.  Bathroom speakers for music - lovely.  Loved the shower. The location was fabulous.  I would choose the hotel again for comfort and quiet.  The internet access was via a cable rather than wifi, so only one of us could use it at a time.  Plus, you had to sit at the desk - so no web surfing in bed. 

Breakfast was included in our ""American Express Stay More"" rate.  A pot of French Press Coffee.  The eggs benedict was quite good - it had greens added for a twist.  

I didn't have much interaction with staff - they didn't appear to be overly friendly.   The breakfast staff were nicer.",5,2009,09,25
204,For us it was perfect,"I am fussy when it comes to staying in hotels i alway check tripadvisor and take into account what people have to say.  Service was great from start to finish from reception, dining room, bar, front of house and staff attending our room.  Our breakfast on both mornings was great and we enjoyed a lovely meal one evening.  When we go back to Dublin i will not spend hours looking for the right hotel to stay in as i am lucky i have already found it.",5,2009,09,22
204,Fantastic stay.....delicious food.....excellent service!,"Wanting a week end of relaxation, comfort and fine dining we couldn't have done any better than choose this hotel. The service on arrival was first class and so helpful and we got an automatic upgrade to our room. The rooms are so comfortable and spacious and above all, quiet. We booked Thorntons for dinner that evening and oh my god it was a fantastic experience. We went for the tasting menu and were blown away by the tastes of each dish. Tho very pricey it was well worth it as this was a special occasion stay. Breakfast is also very good with great variety. location can not be beaten , all in all a wonderful hotel and will be back for definate!",5,2009,09,22
204,Good hotel if you like corporate style,"This is a very good choice if you like big hotels. The decoration is good and the rooms are clean. I am not so sure about the service....as I said, it's a corporate hotel....there are so many people / customers that attention to details is often forgotten....shame, it could be the best one around!",4,2009,09,16
204,Great place to stay!,"Good location, great nice rooms and the staff were extremely courteous and helpful.  A great hotel with good amenities.",5,2009,09,15

204,"Fitzwilliam Hotel, Fantastic!!!!!!!!!","We had the hotel arrange for me, my daughter, and four other family members to be picked up at the airport. Which it all went like clock work. Then from the minute we arrived at the front door till we left six days later, we were showered with excellent service. The entire   staff  from the front desk, to the concierge, to the room attendants were extremely friendly and accommodating to all our needs. We took the breakfast plan and there was plenty of choices, and the servers were very friendly also. The food at the bar was excellent and the bar service was very efficient. At times we just want to sit in the lobby to relax after sightseeing all day and they would accommodate us with drinks and whatever we wanted. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely go back to The Fitzwilliams.",5,2009,09,10
204,more hospitality than one could hope for,The hotel staff was very helpful and pampered us greatly.  We felt like VIPs though we looked like vagbounds entering the hotel after two days of driving around the west coast of Ireland.,5,2009,09,09
204,The hotel was a pleasure to stay in!,"We stayed in a deluxe room as we have 2 very young children, it was a pleasure to return to the room every evening, The room was a good size comfortably accommodating a travel cot and the fold down bed (which could if needed fold back as a sofa bed). The bathroom was again good size, powerful shower as well as a long deep bath. The location was great (just a few doors down from stephens green shopping centre). Our room faced onto the green (luas stop right outside door), we stayed mid week however street noise could be heard so the weekends may be a different story if this is an issue then the hotel does have rooms facing the (less attractive) courtyard. 
Breakfasts were delicous.
In a nutshell we will be returning (with or without the children!!)",5,2009,09,09
204,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here while visiting friends in Dublin recently. There was noting to fault about the hotel. The location is unbeatable, the room was beautiful and staff were excellent.",5,2009,09,08
204,Fantastic location and service!,"The room was great, the location excellent and the staff very helpful. I emailed them b/f coming b/c we were arriving at 4:30 am hoping for an early check in. Someone called me immediately and left a message saying they would try to get us into a room early but to  get there early b/c they could store our bags and give us a room to freshen up.
As promised they checked us in early .I highly recommend this Hotel you will not be disappointed!",5,2009,09,07
204,A Good Hotel,"I stayed here for a week in Aug/September

Reception: Efficient and friendly. Walking a new guest to the elevator is a nice touch.

Room: Room was standard, clean dry warm. There was a turndown service each night. There was a loud intermittent noise coming from the air conditioning which didn't necessarily bother me but would probably annoy a more sensitive guest.

There was free WIFI and in Room Broadband which was useful. There is also a business centre containing 2 PC's and a printer if you need it.

Location: Excellent as it is located on Stephen's green. It is approximately a 30 Euro taxi ride from Dublin Airport. 

I didn't eat in the hotel. 

I would recommend the hotel but only at a discounted rate. There was nothing in this hotel that screamed 5 Star. The service was definitely good but again nothing stellar. If you are paying in excess of 150 Euro per night  then I would definitely shop around.",4,2009,09,06
204,Gorgeous Hotel in Perfect Location,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights before we ended our 2.5 week trip in Europe.  My wife became sick and needed a prescription before the flight home.  Front desk staff were diligent in having an on-call doctor attend at our wonderfully appointed room as soon as possible, and then we stepped out the door into the heart of Dublin.  The place is beautiful, and the service was better.  Highly recommended.",5,2009,09,03
204,EXCELENT LOCATION AND VERY GOOD STAFF,"The Hotel location is perfect. The aparment were we stay was new and everything worked well. The free internet works and it is ""really"" high speed. We had a very good stay. Concierge was very good and always helped with good information and attention. The bad thing was the noisy from the gym in the morning. Our apartment was in front of the gym´s door.",5,2009,09,02
204,Lovely place,"We had a great time here. Fantastic food (and we ate at Citron, not the Michelin star restaurant, Truffles), a great cocktail bar downstairs and extremely helpful staff. Hard to beat the location too, especially with parking.

We upgraded our room and it was worth it for the extra space. Highly recommended.

My only criticism, and it's a small one, is that the cooked breakftast could have done with beans being included as it seemed very dry with a grilled tomato providing the only moisture on the plate.",5,2009,09,02
204,This hotel leaves all the others in the dust,"We usually stay in another city centre hotel when in Dublin but was seduced by the rate at the Fitzwilliam. After staying there last weekend we have been seduced by the staff, the decor and the ambiance. We are now converted and I cant wait for a reason to stay in this hotel again.",5,2009,09,02
204,Nice hotel with a friendly staff,The Fitzwilliam is a great hotel.  It was updated and modern. We stayed 2 nights in August and would definitely go back again.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  It is a bit pricey but I think it's one of the best hotels in Dublin.,4,2009,08,27
204,"Extremely disappointed, not a 5 star hotel","This hotel is a long way from 5 star.  The room was small and the decor was a bit tacky.  The buffet breakfast was made using the cheapest ingredients and most of it wasn't particularly fresh.  An embarrassment to Irish hospitality and the famous Irish breakfast.   The main problem though was that a loud humming noise, coming from a vent in our room, went off every 5 minutes and continued all night.  I managed to sleep for only a few 1/2 hour intervals.  It was like a torture chamber.  I called the desk at 3.30am and no one came to investigate which suggested to me that the hotel was  aware of what was causing the noise. The next morning, we finished our terrible breakfast and checked-out.  I explained to the receptionist that I was absolutely exhausted after the worst night in a hotel I had ever experienced.  I was offered free carparking....€10!  The room had cost us €255 for 1 night.  The manager eventually discounted the room by €50.  Pretty pathetic considering I wasn't even provided with the basics of a quiet and comfortable place to sleep. On returning home I sent an email to the hotel about my dire experience.  The hotel did not bother to reply.  Even if you put the room noise down to bad luck, the service we received was so bad I could not recommend this hotel to anyone.  I would have no confidence in this hotel to help out if things go wrong.  I get the impression that this hotel's strategy is to charge a premium, service the customer as cheaply as possible and show little interest in whether you return to stay with them again.  I visit Dublin regularly and would strongly recommend the Merrion or the Shelbourne for a true 5 star experience.",2,2009,08,26

204,pure luxury!,"we booked a ' secret hotel' with lastminute.com, so we took the fantastic chance to live one day and one night in a superb hotel. everything was perfect: lots of amenities, from fresh flowers in both bedroom and bathroom, to wifi connection, cd and mp3 also in the bathroom, and wiew on a beautiful roof garden!!
the hotel is 2 minutes walking form the very centre of dublin, so we hadn't to catch our car to reach all that we wanted to visit.
the parking was inside the hotel, and it costed only 10 euro per day (while all the other parkings in dublin are much expensive).
the staff was the most helpful we had ever met: they suggested where to eat, where to listen good music, and even booked for us a table to an excellent restaurant (pig's ear).
our holiday in ireland couldn't end better!",5,2009,08,16
204,"great location,nice staff but.......",The rooms are really small. Too small for a five star hotel. The foyer is dull and definitely not welcoming. We were very disappointed but the location is fantastic and staff were helpful and friendly.,3,2009,08,14
204,Basically Perfect,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is probably the best choice of Lodging in Dublin, at least within the five-star consortium. I stayed with my mother after an academic program in Dublin (I am a teenager) for 8 nights, which is a rather long time to stay in one place, but it was the perfect place to have chosen. 

Location: Ideal. Directly fronting Stephen's Green, you walk out of the lobby and within 60 seconds you can be either in that great park, or on Grafton Street; and unlike, say, the Westbury, a similarly ranked hotel that prides itself on being directly on Grafton, the Fitzwilliam isnt awkwardly wedged so close to the hubbub of the street that there is no escaping it if, say, you really dont care for all the shopping and associated frenzy. The spot was just quiet enough, just serene enough, but also just close enough to Grafton and thereby to the sights that Grafton leads to (Trinity, O'Connell St., Temple Bar, Dublin Castle). In the other direction, east along the green, the national museums for art, natural history, and archaeology are within a senic 5 or 10 minutes walk.

Rooms/public spaces: Design is at the forefront of this hotel so the rooms, hallways, and lobby areas are notably chic. The lobby is the perfect place to cozy up in with a (provided) newspaper by the fire on a rainy night, or to wait for someone while looking out at the park on a sunny afternoon. Off the elevator bank is a small reading nook with dual couches, a coffee table, and bookshelves that captures essentially the cool-but-sophisticated tone of the whole hotel. Rooms were similarly trendy with purples and greens, window seats, and stunning orchid plants. The bathrooms also were very nice and the shower - particularly after three weeks using a weak, college dorm, wall-mounted showerhead - was amazing. One complaint with the rooms is size and storage space; you enter and look around with the illusion that there are tons of closets but as you open them, one has the fridge, another the coffee maker, yet another the ironing board, an there is only one small wardrobe for clothes. The space between the beds and the desk/tv/windows was also tight - manageable, but more apce would be needed for more than two guests.

Dining: Only ate on property once, dinner at citron, very good.

Overall: Excellent hotel. Concierge (except for one fellow whose english wasnt excellent and who tried to push tours we didnt want on us without listening to what we did want) was ecxellent at not only their specific duties but also greeting us at the door, pressing for the elevator, general hospitality. We encountered, including but not limited to that one concierge, some staff whose english skills were lacking; one evening i asked the front desk for one of the fitwilliam hotel folders that they keep iguest services info in in the rooms, for my own use in school, and the man got me a newspaper, and then the dinky cardboard they use to wrap the newspapers in when they leave them outside the rooms in the morning, before understanding my rather simple request. However for the most part, staff was knowledgeable, courteous, and extremely skilled at what they did.

Excellent stay, I was depressed to leave, great city as well. I woould definitely reccomend!",5,2009,08,09
204,Great Place for a Stag Weekend in Dublin,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam with 10 friends for my Stag Party\U2 concert at Croke Park.  The hotel is located at the base of St. Stephen's Green\Grafton St. - plenty of things to do, great bars, clubs and restaurants within a 10 minutes walk of the hotel.  The hotel is very comfotable, the rooms are modern, average size for europe, with a nice bed and bathroom.  The hotel has a 24 hour bar for hotel guests which was great considering we were there for a stag party.  The concierge staff were very helpful and the check in\check out process was very efficient.  

I did not eat at the hotel but some of my friends did and thought the food was very good.  One of the highest rated restaurants in Dublin, Thortons, is located in the hotel.  We had an unbelievable meal at Bang Cafe which is about a 10 minutes walk from the hotel.",4,2009,08,06

I could not fault it, the rooms are really nice very well decorated and comfortable, I thought the bathrobes in the room were a lovely touch.The breakfeast was one of the nicest I have  had in a hotel. They offer a turn down service aswell and you get a chocolate on your pillow.Overall great place to stay nice to have a little bit of luxury in Dublin City.",4,2009,08,02
204,"A perfect place to base your stay in Dublin, classy, elegant, functional.","The hotel had everything we needed and more, a nice mix of opportunities to socialize or hide-away once arrived. Within steps outside the door you have easy access to the whole of Dublin by foot, or public transportation if no car. So much to enjoy nearby -shopping, theatre, clubs and pubs, St. Stephen's Green and pedestrian only streets leading to historical landmarks, bridges, river ways and side-street shops. And at the end of the night - or wee early hours of the morn - you can even return to the lobby and lounge to re-cap the night - 24 hour service, what a delight! Definitely on my list of 'return to' places. I was traveling solo from San Francisco and met up with my daughter and son-in-law from Minnesota for our stay in Dublin to attend the U2 concert (walked to Croke Park) and get re-acquainted with friends we had met previously from Ireland. The only disappointment and minor at that, I kept having to remind the desk to deliver a newspaper.",5,2009,08,01
204,supercallafragilisticexpe-allidocious,"we had a lovely stay in a fine hotel, the reception area and staff were friendly and helpful, the room was clean and comfy and every element oozed sophistication.
will most certainly return to dublin for the stay in the fitzwiliam alone....",5,2009,08,01
204,Fantastic Hotel in Fantastic Location,"I lived in Ireland from 1999 to 2003 so consider myself a ""local"" when I visit Dublin.  The purpose of this trip was to see U2 at Dublin's Croke Park.  I had narrowed my hotel choices down to two choices - the Fitzwilliam or the Shelbourne.  Ultimately, decided on the Fitzwilliam because I was able to get a full Irish breakfast included in my rate provided I used my Amex.  No such offer at the Shelbourne.  And an Irish breakfast is an important thing to wake up to.  So, the Fitzwilliam it was. Our rate was about EUR200 per night.  We booked in March when the Euro was trading at about EUR1 = USD1.28.  As of our arrival it had gone up to about USD1.44.  

Prior to my arrival I learned that the hotel was booked solid for the weekend so was a little worried about things being chaotic.  Nope. Never felt like that.  In fact, given that most guests were there for the concert, it was quite an upbeat atmosphere. 

The rooms are as described in every other post and in the photos.  The one thing I really liked was that a full stereo system is in every room and the speakers are mounted in the walls of the bedroom and the bathroom.  So, you could turn the radio on, put a CD in, and listen to it.  I did not see an AUX plug for an iPod, but the sound was great.  I really liked this feature.  

They also provide you with free broadband access.  So, if you have your laptop you can get online with no trouble.  It's via a cable, but no complaints. 

Housekeeping is done twice a day and towels were always replaced.  

Dublin's pubs close around 11pm.  So, unless you go to a ""super"" pub with a late license or to a nightclub (like the Dandelion club located next door) you won't be able to get booze.  As a hotel guest, the ""Inn on the Green"" bar in the hotel is open to you until late, around 3am.  So keep that in mind.  

Overall, no detail was ignored and I would not hesitate to stay here again.  

However, as with any hotel you do need to be mindful of a couple of things.  First, phone calls.  I made two local phone calls (as in Dublin's area code ""01"") both of which were about 5 mins in duration each.  The charge was EUR20.55 for both.  For local calls, I thought that was excessive.  I know hotels mark up phone calls, but this was outrageous.  

And you have to look over your guest bill.  Depsite the fact that breakfast was included with our rate, there were two charges for EUR12.50 each for breakfast.  We disputed this at check out and they could not even explain it.  They removed the charges immediately and we were on our way.  

The two small issues we had were insignificant to our overall experience.  We'd have no problem staying here again and will likely do so on return trips to Dublin.",5,2009,08,01
204,Luxury Hotel in a Great Location,"Decided to take a trip to Ireland with some friends for summer vacation.  After doing a lot of research on places to stay, we settled on the FitzWilliam.  The service started from two days before we left and when we arranged car service from the airport to the hotel.  The company also doubles as private tour guiding of Dublin and the countryside - which was fantastic - be sure to ask for Ray. 

The hotel is what I would call a modern retreat with touches of luxury and class.  The lobby (and hotel for that matter) is done in lots of purples and greens, with low seating, and carefully placed lighting.  Upon inspection of the room, the same motif carries on.  We had an executive room with two singles. There is a large purple felt headboard above the wonderfully comfortable beds. Also a nice but awkward, almost yoga like, seating by the window.  There is a large desk with FREE internet and a TV with a good selection of channels.  The closet is large enough with a full size iron and board.  The bathroom is also relatively modern, decent size, and a powerfully refreshing shower.  The reviews are true though, the rooms are teeny - very hard to walk around with one person, nevermind two.

The dining options are all very good.  Dinner at Thornton's is an interesting experience, be ready for 45euro plated meal and a good palette.  Citron serves up a wonderful breakfast and the Inn on the Green is open all night long for drinks (popular on Thursday - Saturday). 

The location of this hotel is unbeatable. Right across the street from St. Stephens Green, the light rail system, and only 25 steps to Grafton Street.  Its central location allows a great base for sightseeing or business travel.

Would definitely recommend to someone who likes the W chain in the U.S. or a new and growing type of trendy luxury.  Will be back when in Dublin - Happy travels.",5,2009,07,27
204,Rooms can be noisy and small,"I was givena room on the second floor,  At 10PM, the disco cranks up until 4AM.  I asked to be moved, and was accomodated.  But the room was so small as to be uncomfortable.  There was no place to put a suitcase, one chair which was virtually impossible to even get into.  The bathroom was nice.  I was awakened by the front desk at 11 PM with them asking if I wanted my laundry picked up.  The location is good, but a little too close to all of the noise of Grafton St.  I got a good price, but it is not worth their usual price.",5,2009,07,26
204,"Great place, perfect location and great people.",May seem small from the outside but when you go in its obvious this hotel has class and comfort. Spent one night in the close by night clubs and one in the residents bar and both night were excellent. The bar stocked just the right drinks of a high quality and the surrounding night life was buzzing. However returing to your bed room was a pleasure with very comfortable beds and everything you need in the room.,5,2009,07,25
204,"Smartly presented, nice hotel.","We only made use of the room, so cannot comment on the Bar or Restaurant, but the hotel is very well presented and clean and tidy.  Very friendly and helpful service from all the staff.  Comfortable beds with good air conditioning and other facilities.  If we had more time, we would definitely have tried the restaurant and bar. Not my sort of decor, but nice all the same!",4,2009,07,23
204,"Perfect Lodgings, Perfect Location","I was fortunate enough to schedule a short (2 night) layover in Dublinand even more fortunate to stay in the Fitzwilliam.  From the moment I arrived I was treated like a long-lost friend.  My room was beautifully appointed, spacious, immaculate, and welcoming.  Room service was prompt and the food piping hot and delicious, with a courteous wait staff and prompt pickup of dirty cutlery.  All the media applications worked flawlessly.

I found breakfast at the buffet to be better than the average fare at European hotels (which is better than said at America hotels, if more expensive), but the least impressive part of the stay.  The concierge made up for it with his fantastic recommendations and manner, and with his guidance I had a fantastic day.  The Fitzwilliam's location (off Grafton Street and on Stephen's Green) is absolutely the best.  There is a seemingly endless array of dining, relaxation, and shopping choices within walking distance.

I will stay at the Fitzwilliam again.  My only suggestion would be to add an airport shuttle service, as cab fare will run you 35 Euro.",5,2009,07,22
204,An obviously very satisfied customer,"Before booking any of my hotels for Ireland I read the reviews and after reading the reviews for the Fitzwilliam I contacted them directly through email. I was quickly answered by ELENA QUIJANO, Reservations Manager, who through several emails made great suggestions to my upcoming trip to Ireland; and later reassuring me when I got advanced travel alerts as well as being concerned at the prospect of driving on the wrong side of the road. So even before I stepped foot in The Fitzwilliam lobby I had great service!

My flight arrived at the ungodly hour of 6:30 a.m. and when I walked to the front desk of the Fitzwilliam I was greeted by Sam, who bless his heart took pity on a weary frazzled traveller and arranged for me to get into my room as early as possible. For some reason Sam was at the front desk every time I went there during my stay and I was always treated to a wide smile and swift service. Anytime we had to deal with the front desk it was a pleasure.

The lobby lived up to its online photos and even more important so did my hotel room, beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean and oh so comfortable. This is high compliments from a person who travels with Clorox wipes! 

And then there was Tony the Concierge, who to his great chagrin learned that I had booked events from home instead of using his services, each time I was going somewhere he shook his head in dismay because I would have arrived at the same place with much less work. Oh so true!  Even my last arrangement and to his great amazement I had to get my rental car by leaving the hotel to return to the airport to pick it up, a service he would have been happy to arrange, so instead of starting my trip across Ireland straight from the Hotel Lobby I  instead had the hassle and expense of going all the way back to the airport! I promised Tony that the next time I come to Ireland, I would have him take care of every detail! A promise I fully intend to keep and I know the first stop on my trip will be to The Fitzwilliam.

An obviously very satisfied customer",5,2009,07,21
204,Stay Here!,"We've stayed in many hotels around the world, 5* to motels, and it's the attitude and demeanour of the staff that makes all the difference - you won't be disappointed at The Fitzwilliam.  The concierge also got us a great table at Shanahan's steak restaurant a few doors away - a great recommendation.  Can't wait to repeat the experience.",5,2009,07,21
204,Great hotel in a great location,A really nice hotel in a super location. We needed car parking and that came free - when we arrived our car was parked for us and due to central location we did not need it for the duration of our stay. Our room was good - bathroom was excellent with a very good rain shower. Was it perfect? well almost  - first morning we had a wake up call we did not book at 05.30 only to be followed by another at 06.30 to say our taxi was waiting!!!. Next morning at the same time some revellers returning from a night out seemed to forget the volume button!!  However neither of these spoiled our stay and we would give the hotel top marks.,5,2009,07,19
204,pure luxury,"My husband and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam as part of our recent European holiday and loved everything about it.  I agree that it is a bit on the pricey side but worth every cent.

On arrival, our bags were discreetly whisked away and were in our room almost before we were.  The room itself was perfect with gorgeous views over St Stephens Green and the bed was so comfortable I had trouble getting up.  Free internet was a great perk and the bathroom was very luxurious with fluffy towels, bathrobe and great toiletries.

Would definitely recommend the hotel and intend to stay there again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2009,07,18
204,"pampered,relaxed and restful stay at the Fitzwilliam is guaranteed.","Stayed at the Fitzwilliam in June with my sister-inlaw and liked it that much that I returned in July with my husband and kids.We all thoroughly enjoyed our stay and  our kids keep asking when we can return again! Hope to later in the year.  Great location,beautiful decor,
comfortable beds,clean fresh rooms and bathrooms.Especially enjoyed the late breakfast Sunday morning (12MD ) and the use of car park even after we checked out.These little extras make you want to return to the Fitzwilliam again and again.Our 7yr old daughter was so excited about the TOOTH FAIRY !!!! leaving chocolates on our pillows when we were out !!!!! Priceless memories.",5,2009,07,18
204,wonderful hotel - wonderful staff -beautiful rooms - highly reccomended,the stay was wonderful from check-in to check-out. the rooms are very neat and recently renovated.  great sound system. great staff.  great location. highly recommended,5,2009,07,18
204,Fabulous hotel in a wonderful location,"The Fitzwilliam is superb, staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you, the room had a contemporary decor and was very clean. A bed and pillows to rival Westin Hotels 'Heavenly' beds and the location was fantastic, we were able to go for a wander round St Stephen's Green, which is only a stone's throw from the hotel's front door. With Grafton Street only yards away it was perfectly sited for our trip. The breakfast was one of the best I've had in any hotel anywhere and that comes from a notoriously hard to please  Ulsterman who loves a good fry up!
Stay here and you will not be disappointed. If there was a chain of Fitzwilliams around the world, I probably wouldn't stay at a Westin ever again.",5,2009,07,18
204,One of the very best!,I've stayed in hotels all over Europe and the Fitzwilliam is among the best there is. Superb service on all levels and very afordable. Will ALWAYS make it a point to stay there on trips to Dublin.,5,2009,07,18
204,"V nice hotel, expensive breakfast","Nice hotel, well presented, good service, rooms fine, what you would expect from a hotel of this rating.  Would recommend.  Not alot else to say, apart from the breakfast, now don't get me wrong it was a very nice breakfast, but at £25 a head it's a bit over the top.",4,2009,07,18
204,we loved the fitzwilliam,"We were delighted with the fitrzwilliam during our stay in Dublin.  We arrived from San Francisco with three kids at 6 in the morning.  Even though our room wasn't going to be ready to hours the staff quickly found us a room to use until then so we could all catch up on sleep...no charge.  The staff was warm and helpful and kind to our children.  It's a pretty, stylish but not so hip that I felt uncomfortable with the kids.  We stayed in a family room that could accomodate all of us without charging a fortune.  Also, perfect location.",5,2009,07,18
204,"Posh, comfortable, great hotel!","I loved my stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin! I went by myself for a much-needed vacation in late June and it was a great experience. I booked a room with a balcony and the view was awesome, overlooking St. Stephen's Green and to the left you can see just the edge of Grafton Street from the balcony.

Even though I arrived at 9 a.m., they had my room ready and let me check in early. I found the room to be super clean, very comfortable and elegant. It wasn't too fussy, and the flat-screen TV and free internet were nice perks. Also, the shampoo and conditioner and bodywash provided are excellent! This hotel even provided face cloths, which is kind of rare in European hotels. Nice clean fluffy towels, too. There is a little minibar in the room (it's the kind that charges you automatically if you remove something) and there is also a free coffee/tea-making area right above the minibar, with complimentary teas and coffees in the room. 

The hotel offers room service and they have a couple of restaurants and a bar. I ate in the bar twice (the food is from one of the restaurants) and it was very pleasant. The wait staff is very friendly in the bar and helpful and it wasn't crowded or loud. Also, it's so nice when traveling alone when the waitstaff treats you just as well as they do the couples and groups, I loved that, the bar was very pleasant. I had the leek/potato soup one night and the fish & chips another night and it was good and not too pricey.

The concierge desk was very helpful, too. One of the guys -- I think his name was Viktor -- helped arrange an afternoon bus tour for me. Everyone who worked at the hotel was very helpful, not obtrusively helpful, but there if you needed anything.

I got a good rate on this hotel by going through American Airlines' hotel booking site online (and you get miles for booking that way.) It was at the higher end of what I was willing to pay for a hotel, but in the end I am glad I splurged and got the room with the balcony, it was just so pleasant and relaxing. This was one of the nicer hotels I have stayed in anywhere. It's a great choice in Dublin, it's so close to everything yet at night it's nice and quiet (I am a very light sleeper, and I didn't hear any noise at all!)",5,2009,07,16
204,Wished I had more than one night!,"My boyfriend and I just recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was the last night of our trip and we had pre-booked the hotel knowing we would be tired and weary and we wanted a 5 star, restful experience before making the journey back to the states. It was definitely a splurge in price for us, but for the most part, worth it.

Checking in was super easy and our bags arrived to our room quickly. When we walked into our room there was nice jazz playing on the in-room sound system (good touch!). We were instantly impressed with the design and style of the room, not to mention how wonderfully comfy the bed was! The bathroom was also lovely and clean. I couldn't wait to take a shower under the rain fall shower head.

Being our last night and all we decided to get take out and bring it back in to the hotel to eat it. We figured if we were spending that much money to staty there we should enjoy it. The hotel is in an excellent location, just steps aways from St. Stephens Green and Grafton St. (shopping district). 

Our experience was great, however there were two downfalls. First, the shower that I was so excited to use didn't work very well. The water was either way too hot, or way too cold. No in between. That dissapointed me a lot, and I said so on the comment card. Also the hotel provides free broadband, which didn't work. After the two of us struggling to get it to work we finally called the desk to inquire. They gave us a free pass on their wifi, but still, no one wants to deal with those hassels.

All in all I loved the hotel (did I mention the bed was wonderful?!?!). Had it not been so pricey I would have loved to stay there the entire time, but alas, we're young and on a budget, so one night it was!",4,2009,07,16
204,Disappointed!,"Our first impressions of the Hotel were very good, we arrived at the Hotel and immediately we had help with our bags and the car was taken and parked for us. Check in was easy and the receptionist was friendly she showed us to our non-smoking room and on entering the room it reeked of smoke on which she commented on as well. We were moved to a room on the next floor, our luggage took 1hour to arrive with us as they could not locate it, not great service for a 5 star hotel!! When we checked out the next morning no one asked us if everything was ok they just pushed the credit card machine across the desk for us to pay. On leaving the car park the ticket which had been validated for us to exit the car park did not work resulting in us delaying other guests trying to leave the car park as well!! 
Not sure that I would be happy staying here again although the location of the Hotel was good and close to all the shops etc.",3,2009,07,13
204,A MUST STAY in Dublin!,"During the last seven years our shows have been traveling extensively.  Our rooms have always been first class, and then, we had the honour of staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin.
The location is abslolutely exceptional with a mere 15 to 20 minute stretch of the legs getting you most anywhere a traveler would want to go.
The staff from the moment we checked in were on top of their game.  From the Concierge of the year for all of Ireland for 2009 to the engaging and professional staff behind the adult bar with the breakfast bar in the morning iproviding a truly delicious way to start your day.
Our room overlooked St. Stephens Green where you could here the gentle clopping of horses early in the morning as the mist was rising over beautiful St. Stephens Greene.
A truly special moment.
The rooms were perfectly appointed with bathrooms that were worthy of this superb establishment.
We were staying at the Fitzwilliam during St. Patrick's Festival the hotel was packed, yet the service overall never missed a beat.
From truly attentive staff, to supremely comfortable rooms with a location that can hardly be matched, the Fitzwilliam is a MUST STAY whenever your in Dublin....you won't forget it!",5,2009,07,05
204,"Terrific Location, comfortable rooms and exceptional staff.","Our stay at the Fitzwilliam was a total pleasure throughout the 6 days that we spent there.

 The location of the hotel was fantastic as it allowed us to be right in the centre of Dublin  and our front facing room allowed us a view of the greenery of Stephens Green. An added bonus!

The bath and shower facilities were terrific and the bed we slept in was the most comfortable I have ever experienced. The rooms were spacious although they may not be laid out to everyones taste. A minor snag.

As a Bushmills drinker I was happy that the bar had a very pleasent atmosphere and the staff were particularly friendly as were the concierge dept who went above and beyond the call of duty a bunch of times and couldn't have been more helpful. Our stay in the Fitzwilliam made this one of the most enjoyable trips to Dublin that we've ever had.",5,2009,07,04
204,Fantastic Experiance,"We checked in on a busy saturday afternoon(Dublin was buzzing!!) for a two night stay at the Fitzwilliam, as a surprise for my partners 30th birthday....  The staff were very friendly and accomodating.... we ate in the Citroen restaurant had a great meal with fantastic service.... a memorable weekend for the both of us.... we plan o returning next year for my 30th!",5,2009,07,04
204,"Poor service, nice rooms but small","Hotel is well appointed, rooms are very nice, however I payed a ""superior room"" which was very small.   Supposed to have a balcony but didn't (fine print said ""some"" with balcony.

Most disappointing thing was service - small things - ask front staff to print something out for me but they don't bother to bring it up.   Ask for breakfast and only get half of what asked for.   Ask for directions to a restaurant and it isn't very good.   Business centre looked like it had been trashed - no one was paying attention.

Overall ok hotel, nice small rooms, great location, but could be better.",3,2009,06,30
204,"Lovely hotel, Coeliac friendly, but short of five star","Lovely modern international hotel in great St Stephen's Green location. 15 minute stroll to Temple Bar, so you get the craic without the noise! Hotel bar expensive but great cocktails.

We stayed in an executive double. The bed was huge and really comfortable, there was a nice window seat overlooking the roof garden, and the bathroom was excellent. The bedroom itself did feel a little cramped but the quality of the fixtures and fitting was high.

I would rate this as a four star hotel rather than five, but good value for money at 195 Euro a night including breakfast. I found it worth booking direct with the hotel to get breakfast included as you don't usually get B&B on the hotel broker websites. There are plenty of cafes nearby where you can pick up breakfast, if you'd rather do it that way. 

One excellent touch was that the hotel has gluten-free bread available for breakfast - a welcome touch for Coeliacs like me!",3,2009,06,26
204,"Perfect location, gorgeous rooms","Perfect location. You step out onto St. Stephen's Green, the end of Grafton St., and with St. Stephen's shopping Center around the corner. The rooms are gorgeous, spacious, and with lots of natural light and inviting decor. The bathroom is beautiful and a great place to relax after a long day. I was happy that they provided separate shampoo and conditioner and fluffy bathrobes. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. There is a business center where you can print for free. They also offer complimentary chilled mineral water in your room. 

Negatives: The bed was okay but not the most comfortable. The walls are a bit thin and noise from other rooms can be heard. The perk of a CD player in your room means that you can also hear music playing from the adjacent room. Wi-fi is not included (broadband is -- but I didn't bring my computer, only a handheld). I was surprised that I had to request to have my sheets changed. 

Despite the minor negatives, I was very happy and would stay here again.",4,2009,06,24
204,"Great hotel, perfect location","Had a great time in Dublin, and staying here was one of the main reasons.
Everything about the hotel is elegant, modern, smooth, clean. All personnel were polite and helpful. Breakfast staff were all great. Food superb.
No complaints about anything from us! Would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Dublin. We also stayed at the Fitzwilliam Belfast. Both locations are wonderful.
The 'business center' has 2 free computers with printer, and free internet.

There is a trendy club next door, and it was a bit noisy on Saturday night because we left our window open, but with the window closed it wasn't a problem.",5,2009,06,23
204,Perfect!,"After almost 24 hours of traveling, I was so happy to reach the elegant Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The service is impeccable - we were quickly taken to our room, which while a tad small, couldn't have been better.  The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, the shower had amazing water pressure, and there were just so many thoughtful touches to the room, such as:

-- candle and matches by the bed and in the bathroom
-- cd player with a whole list of CDs available to check out
-- complimentary water and chocolate truffles
-- umbrellas for rainy dublin
-- cushy robes
-- lists of ""the best of Dublin"" so you knew where to go and eat
-- business center with free internet
-- free green apples to enjoy as a snack!

In addition, the concierge was fantastic.  My jet-lagged self called and requested a place to eat for 6 on a Friday night - and I called at 5:30.  He got us in to a FANTASTIC restaurant called the Pearl Brasserie, which was amazing.  

Aside from being a beautiful hotel, the location is PERFECT.  It is right next to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  This means you can walk EVERYWHERE.  There are tons of pubs and restaurants around the hotel as well as fantastic shopping.   We also easily walked to the Museum of Natural History and a walk through St. Stephen's Green was lovely as well.  We only took cabs to Guinness and to Temple Bar, primarily because of the rain.

We booked our room online and snagged a deal.  Be sure to look there and at hotels.com to see what offers exist for Fitzwilliam as shopping around saved me at least 200 euro.  

I wouldn't recommend staying anywhere else - its absolutely perfect!",5,2009,06,20
204,Definitely worth staying here,"I would stay at this hotel again just for the location, the only taxi's I took in Dublin were too and from the airport ( about 28 euros each way). 

I recently spent three nights in an executive double room on the fourth floor. The hotel was a good value at 200 euro a night. It is located right on St. Stephen's Green at the top of Grafton Street. It is a 7 minute walk to Temple Bar, 1 minute to Grafton Street, 5 minutes to Trinity College and about a 25 minute walk to the Guinness Storehouse. 

The room itself was not large, but well furnished and very trendy. The bathroom was spacious and clean. However, we were at the end of the hall and had problems getting  a steady stream of hot water for the shower. The beds were comfortable, but the pillows kind of large for my taste.  There is complimentary water in the mini-bar but only a small sign to let you know. Unfortunately they do not put water bottles on the night stand and replenish twice daily like Four Seasons hotels or Mandarin Orientals. There is also complimentary wi-fi in the room which is useful, just besure to call the front desk for a voucher to use it.

Our room came with a full irish breakfast. It is a continental breakfast and then you can order hot food such as eggs and sausages. The breakfast is good and the food comes out quickly. You can have it delivered to you room as we did on the day of departure. Oddly enough water was not brought on the room service tray.

I did not use the gym at this hotel, but our room came with free parking for one car.

The service at this hotel was for the most part good. Vicktor the concierge was very helpful and made excellent dinner selections (Pearl Brasserie) and nightclub reservations for us ( Lillie's Bordello). The maids were thorough and quick to help when we broke a glass in the bathroom. The front desk gentleman was nice and cordial. However, one time we went to the front desk and asked about water bottles in the room. We were dehydrated from the night before and wanted water. This hotel employee said that water is in the mini-bar and replenished daily. I knew that, we already drank it. I wanted water and he should have went and got me water, at a Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons that would have been a no-brainer. If you are expecting that level of service the Fitzwilliam wont match it. 

Overall, we  had a great time in Dublin and great stay at the Fitzwilliam. The wonderful location trumps almost everything. We chose this hotel over the Four Seasons for that reason and were willing to give up on other incidentals.",4,2009,06,15
204,Not FIVE Star !!!!,"My husband I stayed at the Fitzwilliam weekend 12th June, and although it is a nice hotel, airy foyer, great location, I wouldn't put it down as a five star hotel. The rooms are beautifully decorated, but on the Saturday after returning from shopping at 4.00pm our rooms weren't even serviced, it was only on our return at 10.30 that night that it was cleaned and the glasses that we had used were now washed and left outside our door on the floor, and indeed were still there when we checked out the following day!
Breakfast was basic, tea and toast cold, service was not adequate, as a lot of the guests had to go looking for milk for their cereal, that's if there was a bowl!, people had to take butter, jam and pepper of other tables when they were not using them, Sunday morning breakfast is self service, well it was just like Piccadily Circus, with everyone trying to get to the breakfast buffet table and back to their seats in what I think a small breakfast room!! Certainly was not a relaxing start to the day .
We stayed at this hotel 2 years ago, and thought is was just a one of experience we had, but no, I won't be back in it again, not when you have the Shelbourne and Westbury sitting right beside the same attractions, thats what I call FIVE Star!!!!",3,2009,06,15
204,"Great hotel, great location, not inexpensive","My wife and I traveled to Europe with our 16 year old daughter in late May.  Dublin was the first stop in a ten day trip and I wanted to find a hotel that provided a situation where we could get a good start and recover from our jet lag in comfort. 

We stayed in an executive room with an attached lounge.  Both rooms were spacious - and thankfully each had their own door as well as flat screen TVs.  The doors to each room opened to a shared foyer connecting to a large bathroom.  It really was the perfect situation.  The room was quiet, on the upper floor.  It had a view of a courtyard, but the view was not memorable and probably not exceptional.  The location could not be better.

The best part for me was the breakfast.  Lots of options, lots of fresh fruits and juices, and of course the Irish sausages and grilled tomatoes.  The only downside was the lack of soda bread - which I love, but seemed to have more trouble finding on this trip.  Breakfast was included in our room rate.  (I think it would have been 24 euros otherwise - it's not worth 24 euros).

On the downside, we had to wait almost an hour past check in time before our room was ready.  It could have been the hotel's fault, but I'll forever blame Beyonce's road crew who had stayed the previous night.  As we sat in the lobby, the crew drifted down to check out.  Dressed in the all black concert regalia of their previous campaigns, they didn't seem like people who spent a lot of time worrying about check out times.  I'm just glad they all found something to do after Tower records closed.

The reception staff was apologetic, but offered no recompense.  Though, somehow I think we got even as my daughter, asleep and snoring in their fancy lobby, was now drooling on their chair.  My wife, though still vertical, was asleep, but could easily have taken for dead by a casual observer.  Probably not the best first impression for customers of a five star hotel.

Though a nice hotel, I now wonder if it was just too much.  Given the state of the Irish economy, the hotel is certainly pricey.  And in a way I regret that this was the first exposure our daughter had to European travel.  I didn't get to Europe until I was well into my twenties and for the first few trips I stayed in scary hotels or on the couches or floors of friends.  For our daughter, her first trip was a much different experience.  Seeing her close the door to her private room wrapped in a fluffy Fitzwilliam robe, I wondered if it was all just wrong.",5,2009,06,09
204,NEVER AGAIN!,"We are a family of 5 who stayed at the Fitzwilliam’s for 2 nights and were supposed to stay for another night before going back to our home.

First of all let me point out that my experience with this hotel started very well since the reservation manager, Mr John Kelly did his utmost to help me with good suggestions about rooms and rates.
Let me also point out that I am usually a very enthusiastic client and rarely complain about a hotel, unless I really MUST.
This time I MUST tell you why I WILL NEVER GO BACK to a place like the Fitzwilliam.

The location is just perfect and all the other reviews can just confirm this: very close to GRAFTON Street, ST STEPHEN GREEN: fantastic when you have a 21 year old, an 11 year old and a 2 year old!

The hotel is very nice but I would not define it a 5 star: I would say that it is a good 4 star: the rooms are nice but the service all over the hotel and restaurant is a bit cold, as though there was not a sense of unity. Everyone is nice but somehow distant.

We stayed for dinner in CITRON and although the service by Fernando was excellent, we were really not impressed with the food: it was OK, but again did not meet the standards of a 5 star hotel. The restaurant itself which is on the mezzanine is a bit anonymous.

Our rooms were clean and well decorated. 

On our trip back to Dublin after 3 days at Ashford Castle a good 4 hours drive from the capital, we arrived at the Fitzwilliam’s where the receptionist told me that it was impossible to check in because of a computer problem.

After a few minutes the assistant manager, (for decency I will not mention his name despite of the fact that we have his business card) came to see me with a very sad face and told me they were unable to check us in because there was a major problem with water supply and the rooms had no water. He said to me he was very upset because he would have an empty hotel for the week end. However, he said, we would stay at the MARRION (I knew already this hotel, it’s a real gem) which was a better hotel, with more facilities, a swimming pool etc.
Useless to say that despite of their “upgrading” I was not excited to move the luggage and especially the boys who were tired for the trip and hyper because of 4 hours of seating in a car but showed a certain sympathy for the whole situation: after all who would like to be the assistant manager of an empty 5 stars on a bank holyday week end?
Only the hotel was far from being empty and the more I waited in the lobby for my husband to come back from the car rental garage, the more I could see that the clients were arriving with their Saturday shopping. Also, I went to the bathroom to change the baby’s nappy and guess what? There was water…

I went to see the manager and share my doubts with him. He said that in fact only 15% of the rooms had no water, the rest was fine…

When my husband arrived, he really thought the assistant’s manager explanation was very strange, but we decided to move hotel anyway. The concierge called a courtesy taxi van for us.
I waited for about 1 hour and 40 minutes, more than 30 minutes just for the cab. Concierge said all the vans were occupied and the traffic was very bad because of BEYONCE CONCERT IN DUBLIN and when I saw a van come I rushed to see if this was ours. Promptly the concierge said this was not ours but guess what? I think I know who had rented the van. A couple of very big body guard type gentlemen open the van and started to extract dozens of cases and, NO KIDDING, dozens of shopping bags from very expensive shops in Dublin… And who sent a double at the museum in Vienna while she was shopping in the city centre a few weeks ago? Was it not Beyoncé?

When my husband asked the concierges if she was staying at the Fitzwilliam’s they suddenly became very evasive saying they could not confirm the information and that we should talk to the manager. My husband went to see him again and asked very simply if they had rented our room to someone else. He became very confused, gave us again the story of lack of water. When my husband asked to see JUST ONE ROOM with no water, he said it was not possible.

I know this story is a bit long but there is only one conclusion: I doubt that Beyoncé or another VIP would stay in the standard room of the Fitzwilliam’s: they would certainly use the penthouse. But how about their staff, the desire for privacy that make certain of these people rent entire floors just to have peace and quiet…
This is maybe a possibility. I will never know for sure…and honestly now I do not care.

Whatever it was, we were told and told again A BARE FACE LIE and treated like perfect idiot. The older kids were really shocked because this behaviour is against the basic rule of education.
People should never be treated with disrespect, no matter if they stay in a 5 or 1 star hotel, no matter if they are dressed in Prada or in old clothes.
Respect is probably not a subject present in all the Hotel schools and probably not in every family. For sure this is not something we experienced with the assistant manager of the Fitzwilliam.

When you choose a nice hotel, you choose a certain number of elements that should never lack. I use a lot this kind of hotels also for work events. The area of St Stephen Green has other remarkable hotels (see my other review)

I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THE FITZWILLIAMS TO ANY OF MY FRIENDS OR COLLEAGUES. NEVER.",1,2009,06,05
204,Mostly good,"Myself and my wife stayed here last weekend and were mostly happy with our stay. It is in a fantastic location, just off Grafton Street. The concierge was very helpful.
The bar area was nice but the staff were a slow with service. The room was lovely with everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel but it was on the small side. (We stayed in an executive room). Breakfast was served until 12pm which I thought was a great bonus. Breakfast was quite good but we did not appreciate the cleaners hoovering the area all around us while we were eating. It would seem obvious that if you are offering a breakfast service until that 12pm, it would be greatly appreciated if one could have breakfast in peace and not be put off by the cleaners!",4,2009,05,27
204,A Fantastic Hotel - great location,"We have just returned from a three night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday. We chose this hotel due to the location and the reviews and we were not disappointed. We had an early flight from Edinburgh and Ihad contacted the Hotel and arranged to drop off our cases about 10.30am. When we arrived our room was ready! It was a lovely room - the bed was very comfortable. We found all the staff very friendly and helpful. The location was great - a few steps to Grafton Street and St Stephen's Green shopping centre.
We will certainly stay at this hotel on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2009,05,22
204,Fabulous hotel in excellent location and pleasant staff-can't wait to return!,"Living in Belfast have had many trips to Dublin but always disappointed by hotel rooms.
Decided on Fitzwilliam because of location and reviews.
It was the best hotel experience I have had in Europe in recent years.
The staff were very welcoming.The decor and rooms are beautiful,bathrooms wonderful.Ordered room service breakfast that arrived on time and warm.The gym is small but adequate with towels and bottled water.
Hotel 30 second walk from nearest shops and lots of restaurants nearby.
Can't wait to go back and try the hotels Michelin star restaurant next time.
Go for it!",5,2009,05,21
204,dublin can be heaven - with a stay at the Fitzwilliam,"Two nights in dear old Dublin and staying in the Fitzwilliam was sheer heaven to me. Book a room at the front with a little balcony and sit there with a coffee and watch the comings and goings in Stephen's Green during the day, then close your doors and sink into the amazing comfort of their beds and have a little snooze, before heading out  for some retail therapy on Grafton Street., just a few steps away.
If you're on a budget, stay a little further up the road in 0'Callaghans,(  my no.2 Dublin Hotel) but for that extra  luxury, views and great service,  The Fitzwilliam is THE place for me.",5,2009,05,18
204,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is a great choice for a stay in Dublin.  Everything about it is smart and sharp.  The staff is helpful and there is a full supply of umbrellas in the lobby to use when going out.  The free computers with printer in the business center are always available.  Although our room was small it was very nicely decorated and appointed. The location is very central, just a few minutes from Grafton Street and across the street from St. Stephen's Green, although the frosted glass in the lobby obscures the view of the Green. Unfortunately you have to see the large TGI Fridays sign a few doors away when walking to the hotel.  But these are minor annoyances.",5,2009,05,17
204,Everything absolutely excellent.,"Excellent - everything absolutely fantastic. Location awesome. Staff excellent. Rooms stunning, beautifully appointed - shower AMAZING. Loved it. Gorgeous. Highly recommended.",5,2009,05,13
204,Excellent location lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel ,beds v comfortable. 
Our room was quiet-thought would be noisy as location is just on Stephen's Green. The green can tend to be a bit noisy as there is a large nightclub about 6 doors down but was pleasantly surprised.
Lovely toiletries in the bathroom 
Good hotel but lacked warmth and if you are going for drinks I wouldn't bother having one here are there are far better bars and pubs around than this one",4,2009,05,11
204,Splendid,"Hotel checking in was excellent, room perfect, bathroom and linen totally spotless. Nice toiletries.  Bed very comfortable indeed.",5,2009,04,14
204,Hidden Gem in Dublin,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin recently - the location of the hotel is fantastic from being so close the social & shopping scenes, to just watching the world go by Stephen's Green in the lobby sipping a glass of vino. The staff are very professional, friendly, and welcoming - nothing is too much trouble for them. Loved the bedroom, with 4 poster bed, plasma tv and stereo system - not to mention the comp apples by the lift! Would recommend this hotel for  any type of stay in Dublin - accommodates all!",5,2009,04,09
204,Loved it!,"Was in town for St. Patrick's Day from the states. Second year in a row but first time at the Fitzwilliam. After an all night flight we arrived at the hotel around 7 am and was very surprised to be shown right to my room.

Smaller room but plenty big enough and lots of nice amenities. For instance a cd player, free wireless and more.

You cannot beat the location, being at the top of Grafton Street. And I thought the staff was fabulous. 

I really loved the power/rain shower in the bathroom. Everything was very clean and I loved the turn down service and nightly treats.

Breakfast was included and fantastic. Very enjoyable and good service.

I ordered room service one evening at it was magnificent. I was embarrassed to find out that they don't make provisions to add a tip on to the room service bill you sign and did not have anything smaller than a 50 euro. The room service waiter was so gracious, assuring me that the hotel paid him for his services and I should not feel bad at all.

The next day, I tracked him down through the management and made sure he got his tip but he was so polite and understanding.

I highly recommend it all the way around.",5,2009,04,02
204,Excellent 5 Star+++++++,"I have recently returned from a hort break in dublin. The Fitzwilliam is by far the best hotel we have stayed in.  My husband and i do like a nice hotel and always book a 5 star hotel.   The hotel, the staff, the service etc was second to none. I can highly reccomend this hotel. It is close to bars, shops, resturants, transport tourist bus, tourist attractions etc etc..............",5,2009,03,31
204,"Lovely Modern Hotel, Fabulous Location","I traveled to Dublin Ireland March 26-29, 2009 because I had never been there and decided I wanted to get away somewhere I had never been. I selected the Fitzwilliam from a travel site that had rated it an ""Insider Select"". When traveling in Europe I try to stay at more modern hotels. I am use to the comforts found in American 4-Star & 5-Star hotels. So when traveling around Europe I am usually a wee bit dissapointed in my accomodations. The Fitzwilliam was cetrally located to all the Major Tourist Sites, close to exciting nightlife,  just off Grafton Street (shopping), overlooking St. STephen's Green. I did pay extra so I would be overlooking the park. The room itself was a bit small which is why I did not give it 5-Stars.  However I was prepared for this. Most rooms in Europe are small. The view was great. My room was on the 4th floor and had a small deck I could have my breakfast croissant on. The bed was comfortable with down pillows and comfort. The Flat screen TV was large and easily seen from the bed. 

The bathroom which I tend to rate hotels and restaurants on primarily was fantastic.  You can hide a world of sins with dark carpet, bleached sheets and a large painting but it is very hard to cover up neglect in the bathroom. There was no mildew, it had recently been renovated, the water pressure was excellent, towels clean, fresh and replaced daily. There were some complaints on-line about the size of the shower curtain. I did not understand this complaint before I arrived. The tub is an oversized tube, about 6' long and about 2.5' deep. The shower curtain only extends about 4.5' of the stub from the shower head end. It is a contemporary design and only people that can't walk and chew gum would flood the bathroom! I did not get so much as a drop of water on the floor. 

The Staff was friendly and accommodating. I arrived at 10 am and figured my room would not be ready till at least Noon at the absolute earliest. To my surprise my room was ready and I could take a nap by 10:15. I would strongly recommend this hotel for anyone 25 - 60 years old or loves the modern contemporary style. The tubs are a little tall for the elderly to easily get into and out of.  

The Internet was free in the rooms. It was a bit slow at times but I could still get my e-mail and Google information. The bar was hopping and the restaurant was good. The fresh flowers in the room were a nice touch. The Gym is very small. A Cycle, treadmill and a set of weights but I don't travel to workout.",5,2009,03,28
204,Good value 5* in brilliant city centre location,"Stayed here recently on a Friday night when in town for a show.
Firstly I would contact the hotel directly by phone and haggle a bargain.
The nearby 5* Westbury has been recently refurbished and are doing €149 room only promotions so I would use that as a bargaining tool ! 
The location is brilliant if you want access to shopping and top class restaurants and bars. Right on St Stephen's Green with the Luas tram system outside the front door.
Concierge was very courteous and parked the car for us - €10 overnight parking rate must be the best value in town. 
Check in was smooth and also courteous - we were a bit early but our room was ready. 
Dont be deceived by the small street front - this is big hotel.
I think we got the standard room but despite being a little on the small side it was very clean and comfortable. Lovely window seats looking out onto the roof garden although you also are looking out directly at the adjoining office block.
There was everything you should need in the room - complimentary spring water, cd sound system, minibar, tea/coffee maker, broadband etc. The bathroom too was nice and immaculate. Breakfast was included which was served in the Citron restaurant which overlooks the hotel foyer. Have to say it was delicous with a great menu.
Overall, I can recommend this hotel without hesitation but be sure to negotiate on price.
The current climate is a buyer's market so be sure to haggle !",4,2009,03,24
204,Business with room for leisure in between,"I stay in hotels on a weekly basis throughout Europe and would not generally review a hotel but a colleague told me about tripadvisor after my recent stay in the Fitzwilliam hotel.
I arrived at the hotel at about 10am and did not expect to get a room but wanted to drop off my bags before attending a meeting. I checked in at reception and was immediately shown to my room by the receptionist. She showed me throughout the room and pointed out the free wireless, free water, power shower & huge sized bath. With this, I was able to catch up on a few emails before heading out.

Not often does it happen but I managed to finish my meetings early and get back to the hotel before 5pm. Having caught up with my emails already, I decided to spoil myself with a look in the shops but got distracted by the rain in the gardens. I was searching for a room service menu when I found the Treatment list instead and luckily, the therapist was available straight away. I had a dinner to attend to so decided to spoil myself with a manicure and got talking to Ursula. I followed this was a massage and started to feel like I was on holiday. This lady is a miracle worker!

I later met my colleagues in the hotel bar for some pre-dinner drinks and sampled some great cocktails and nearly forgot to make our dinner reservation - would not have been a good impression for our clients!!!
The restaurant was nearby but it was a tad wet outside and the concierge loaned us some umbrellas.

I missed breakfast the following morning but my colleagues did say it was a meal in itself. At check-out, the same receptionist checked me out and I was able to collect air miles and my bags were stored and a taxi arranged for my return that afternoon.

This hotel really is a hidden gem and I can't fault the service or the quirkey room style although a little small, they have everthing inside.
P.S. where do I get those fantastic mirrors in the bedrooms??",5,2009,03,10
204,a soulless but noisy hotel,"Booked this hotel as a five star one night away with partner for his birthday. Great location but it is not five star standard. Room was very nice if small. Lobby is soulless and feels like too much concrete. Luggage trolleys in most prominent visual position.
Cocktails in bar expensive but not surprising. What was surprising was the wilted mint and dried up slice of lime in both mojitos. When I pointed this out to the server and suggested he shouldn't serve them, his reply was No? For 25euro for two i'd expect garnish to be fresh!
There was disco music til 2am and a noisy all night generator near our room - first floor. Thankfully we had earplugs! Hardly expected in a five star hotel. I'll give it a miss for the future.
Dublin has better four star hotels.",2,2009,02,02
204,very dissappointed,"Very Dissappointing

I booked this hotel for a romantic break in Dublin and decided to do something special by going to a 5star Hotel. We had agreed a price with the hotel receptionist on the phone and 1 dinner and 2 bed and breakfasts were included in the price also free car parking as we had taken a superior room. we were told to make payment on departure.
on arrival at the hotel we were asked for payment immediately as we had a debit card not a visa. The room was really small and cold as the heating had not been turned on for our arrival. when we ate at the Citron restaurant we were given a bill for over 90euros. (This was for the meal that was included in the price. We the were charged again for the breakfast and the carpark( again this was to have been included). I would never again go to the Fitzwilliam and I came back from my 2day break stressed out.
never again.",1,2009,01,29
204,Superb Hotel - Excellent Concierge,"We spend a few days at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for my partners Birthday.  From arrival the staff couldn't have been nicer - we were shown to our room which was very comfortable, modern and clean.  We spent our time exploring the City on the advice of the Concierge using the hop-on/hop-off bus which is great way to see the main sights.  We were also assisted with a restaurant reservation and booked into a fantastic place on the green by the Concierge (he has great local knowledge).  Breakfast is served at the hotel and offers a vast choice suitable for all tastes.  I would recomend the Fitzwilliam to anyone as a base in Dublin.",5,2009,01,25
204,Good but pricey,"Great location right in the centre of Dublin, adjacent to shopping, trams and park. Maybe the recent depreciation of sterling but found the hotel very expensive - 25 Euros for an albeit excellent full Irish breakfast was a bit steep on top of an already high room only rate. Sevice was friendly and excellent although lack of hot water from my sink tap was rather a surprise in the morning!",4,2009,01,25
204,Won't be returning,"My husband and I spent 4 days at the Fitzwilliam Hotel between Christmas and the New Year 26th – 30th.  We always stay in Dublin at this time of the year to relax after Christmas and check out the sales for some bargains.  Last year we stayed at the Shelbourne and it was absolutely flawless.  We were tempted to return there on this occasion, however we do like to experience other hotels and the location of the Fitzwilliam really appealed to me.  When I shop – I shop, and the luxury of being able to return back to your hotel with your purchases at regular interval during the day was a major plus.  So let’s begin with the pros:

•	Superb location (for those of us who like to spend time on Grafton Street)
•	Large spacious room (this was expected as I booked one of their best rooms and paid extra)
•	Fresh orchids in the room (nice touch)
•	Good breakfast

Cons:

•	Poorly trained staff with zero customer service skills – Apart from the very pleasant young lady who checked us in and showed us to our room, the rest of the staff that we encountered were most unhelpful and ‘distant’.  I don’t know if this was because all the ‘tenured’ staff were on holiday, however in my opinion there is no excuse for poor customer service at any time.
Whilst walking down the corridor to our room, we could hear this loud noise which sounded like a generator of some sort.  We were soon to find out that this was right outside our bedroom door!  We assumed that this would not be heard in the room and on entering the room there was music playing in the background.  When the young lady who showed us to our room left, I turned off the music and we then realized that the noise we heard outside the room could also be heard in the room.  We immediately headed back down to reception to request a different room (the lady who checked us in had told us that the hotel was practically empty).  Here we were met by a guy from Chicago whose name escapes me.  I told him about the noise and without looking at me he told me, I quote “Wow, you’re the first person ever to complain about this in the four years that I’ve been working here”……. I immediately thought to myself – what an outrageous thing to say to a customer.  As it happens, I am a Director of Customer Service for a large Global company, and this type of attitude to any customer is totally unacceptable.  Instead of empathizing with me, listening to my problem and offering a solution, he immediately got his back up (and mine!) and labeled me as a ‘Complainer”.  I did not even get a chance to complain!  I simply advised him of the noise!  I then asked him if he could possibly move me and his response was “I sure can, but you won’t get as nice a room”.  Again, a totally unacceptable response.  Why should I not get a similar room – it was 26th December and the hotel was empty.  To be honest, I was really in shock with this guys response and he then said to me “So, do you want to move or not?”.  I asked him to show us the room that he was offering and he took us there; and wait for it – IT WAS 2 ROOMS DOWN FROM OUR ORIGINAL ONE!!  The room was much smaller, less natural light and the noise from the generator could still be heard.  We declined his offer of this room, and told him that we would stay where we are and see how we got on.  He didn’t seem to care either way and told us that if we changed our minds to let him know.  He was possibly the most arrogant, obnoxious person I have ever come across in this line of business.
We returned to our room, turned up the music and decided to check out the following morning if the noise interfered with our sleep.
•	The bar – lacked atmosphere and the staff were the coldest bunch I have ever met.  We sat at the bar on our first evening along with 2 or 3 other couples.  The rest of the bar was empty.  There were 3 staff on duty and all of them had the exact same manner. You could not possible recruit 3 more similar people (attitude wise) if you tried.  It was like as if there was a brick wall between us (the customers) and them.  They would not make eye contact, and they did not offer to serve you even though we sat at the bar. When you did call them for a drink they put the drink on their side of the bar so that you had to stretch in to get it, and finally when they gave you your change, again this was put on their side of the counter.  We had 1 drink and sat with empty glasses for 20 minutes testing them to see if they would offer us a refill!!! They never made eye contact or approached us.  So we left and went across to the Shelbourne where we spent the next 3 evenings.  

What a shame that the Fitzwilliam has got it so wrong with some of their staff.  In this current economic climate, they can ill-afford to upset their customers and send them over to their competitors for evening drinks and meals.  I did try to speak to a Manager whilst there, and I was told that there was nobody available as they were all on holidays.  With regards to our room, when we returned that evening, there was a voice message from ‘Chicago boy’ telling us that the noise was coming from an NTL generator which is located in the room adjoining our room and hopefully it should go off later in the night!!  It never went off and as annoying as it was, we did not move out the following morning (put it down to laziness!), and instead invested in some ear-plugs which worked remarkably well.  However, we should not have had to invest in ear-plugs and neither should I have to be writing this review.  The ‘Chicago boy’ could have sorted this simple problem out there and then had he wanted to.  Clearly he didn’t and as a result, I will never return to the Fitzwilliam again and some friends of mine who were booked in there in March have since cancelled and will now stay at the Shelbourne instead……..

Give it a miss – there are too many other hotels in Dublin where your custom will be appreciated more.",2,2009,01,13
204,Good Location - Nice Hotel - Not 5* Standard,"We stayed here for 3 nights over the new year. Check in was quick and friendly and our room was clean and very compact. We had a  room overlooking the Green, and settled in for a nice 3 night break. The hotel is very lacking in atmosphere, the bar was for the most part, very quiet and lacking in a certain something. The cocktails were good, but no where near as good as the Westbury or Dylan. Breakfast was a noisy affair, with lots of noise from early morning from the accomodation staff outside. On one occassion, even though we had a do not disturb sign outside, we were telephoned several times to ask could we return our tray, even though we were not finished. The room service was swift, but for the price, (and I never care when I am on holiday about the price) was not 5* quality. I asked on one occassion as I do in many 5* hotels if I could request something off the menu, in this case, a ham sandwich, and I was told they did not have any ham! This has never happened to me in a 5* hotel, you get what you want for a price of course. The locatio could not be more central, but I feel that when paying for a room here, you are getting a 5* location and a 3* hotel ! One small gripe is that we were supposed to have a dvd player and we clearly did not. Another reviewer mentioned that they had a great suprise at the level of the attention their partner received for their birthday and even though my partner mentioned that we wished to take a good room as it was my birthday, we did not even get as much as a happy birthday! (A very different experience from the service and gfit we received in the G Hotel on a previous occassion. This is a clean, hassle free hotel with a great location, if however, like me you like luxury and going that extra mile, book the 4 Seasons or the Dylan.",3,2009,01,05
204,Loved the Fitzwilliam,"Stayed 2 nights in The Fitzwilliam Hotel early December for a pre Christmas break. The hotel is very central on St Stephens Green and within walking distance to all major attractions. 
The room was excellent with the most comfortable bed and pillows I have ever enjoyed. There were fresh orchids in the room and en suite - nice touch! Brilliant over sized bath tub and pressure shower with very nice cosmetics, fluffy robes and slippers.
Loved the whole experience and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a special treat. The only negative was I thought the spa prices were a bit steep but then again it is central Dublin!",4,2009,01,04
204,A fab stay!,"We decided to stay in Dublin city for New Year's Eve. We rang reservations at midday on the 31st and booked in. 

I loved the hotel - the location is amazing right at the top of Grafton Street - so it's great for strolling around or shopping. 

We had a room overlooking the St Stephen's Green which was lovely. Yes the rooms are quite small but the decor is nice and the bathroom was spotless.

I thought the staff were excellent - everyone we spoke to was very friendly. 

The bar is a nice place to start the evening - it is a bit dear but there is a nice atmosphere there. We had breakfast included in our rate - it was nice there was a good selection and the bread was really fresh. I would recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again!",4,2009,01,03
204,"Compact hotel, compact room, OK but nothing special","Difficult to find, disorganised parking arrangements - no offer from hotel to park or collect.
Rooms smaller than expected from a 5* hotel.
Grilled kipper was fried! And service slow even tho not busy.
Otherwise staff pleasant enough and helpful - albeit short on the ground. Had to wait 10 minutes for a concierge to return car key.",3,2008,12,05
204,"Very nice, good service.","The Fitzwilliam is a very nice hotel in a good location right across from St. Stephens Green.

Our room was very nice and roomy with a view of the Green.  The staff were extremely helpful and they were able to honor our request for an early check-in - our flight arrived at 7:30 AM.

We would certainly stay here again.",5,2008,11,08
204,Good location,"Very prompt check in even though we arrived early morning. 

Smart  hotel although the bar was alittle scruffy. We had a superior room overlooking park with small balcony which was very nice as we could sit with a drink and watch the world go by. 

The room was fairly compact and well appointed apart from the terribly noisy air conditioning unit which was very irritating . 

Evening turndown was appreciated but my one main critiscism was the breakfast staff, who on the first two days of our stay, were very un responsive and really did everything to avoid ordering our breakfast. On the Sunday the A team were on duty and breakfast was lovely. 

Would we stay here again?
Probably.",4,2008,11,05
204,Luxury,"This is a luxurious hotel.  Loved the great location, only 2minute walk to the shops. Underground parking but not many spaces and alot are reserved so you might not always get a space. Also parking was a little expensive. Bedrooms are nicely decorated but a little small. Can be a little expensive but I think its worth it. Pity there is no pool in it. Staff are very helpful.",5,2008,10,23
204,Great treat hotel,"We (family of 2 adults and 2 kids) stayed for one night at the Fitzwilliam and had a lovely, relaxing, if slightly expensive stay. We had taken advantage of the Ryanair sale (£40 for 4 of us return) to have a short break in Dublin. Not many hotels seemed to offer family rooms. We decided on a splurge at this hotel. It was v centrally located, walking distance from most attractions. The staff were friendly and professional. The large family room had a massive kingsize bed and a large double sofa. Breakfast was great: cooked and continental. This was hardly a budget stay (£220 including breakfast) but neverthelss, I think was worth it. Lots of nice touches; flowers in the room, chocs at turndown,fruit  etc. Recommended for a treat.",4,2008,10,16
204,Nice but expensive,"I've stayed here several times with work, and will continue to stay here. It is a nice hotel, rooms are well decorated and comfortable and the location is excellent. You also get complimentary, high speed interent in the bedrooms if you have a laptop.

The hotel houses a michelin starred restaurant, but this is pricey and I have not yet dined there (although I can recommend Patrick Guilbaud if anyone fancies a splurge). There is also a cheaper dining option, but the food isn't very good and there are plenty of better dining options in the vicinity.

However, the only real downside to the Fitzwilliam is the price. €200 per night on a corporate rate, and the cheek to charge an extra €24 for breakfast, where service can be unacceptably slow.

Recommended as a decent option when on business, but I wouldn't stay here if I was paying for it myself.",4,2008,10,12
204,Exceeded expectations!,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 1 night in Sept 2008.  This hotel exceeded our expectations!

Location:  Great location at the end of Grafton St. by St.Stephen's Green - walking distance to shops, pubs, and restaurants.  The area was bustling and the park was lovely.

Room: Very well-appointed.  The bed and down pillows were very comfortable.  Modern furnishings and very clean.  The candles, stereo system, and coat rack in the entry room were nice touches. 

Bathroom: Modern and clean.

Service: From the valet for the car all the way to check-out, the staff was very helpful, friendly and professional.  We were escorted to our room at check-in and given a thorough tour.  No problems with making dinner reservations.

Our only complaint was that we only got to stay at this wonderful hotel for 1 night.  We had stayed at a different hotel in Dublin earlier in the week and it was terrible and smelly.  We were relieved to find the Fitzwilliam.  Highly recommended!",5,2008,09,17
204,I'm a business traveller - I want to stay here and enjoy it as a tourist...,"I've just come back from a second stay  in two weeks at The Fitzwilliam on St Stephens Green. 

Plus points are - super location, very helpful and thoughtful staff, amazing beds and linen (I really did not want to get up to go to work...), orchids in the main room and fresh flowers in the bathroom, yummy toiletries, lots of nice towels and dressing gowns, immediately accessible hi-speed broadband access, two phones in the room (although this was also a negative - see below), LCD TV with a decent range of channels.  

Getting stuff copied so easily and cheaply as a business traveller is a joy - at this hotel I found that nothing is a chore - there was a good appreciation of why something was needed.

On my second visit the head concierge treated me as if I was a long lost relative (what a memory) ... and when you book in the staff take you to your room anyway without any expectation of gratuity.  

Great light food in the downstairs bar  (the Ceasar salads are excellent also the Chicken Focaccia and the veggie baquette), and there is a delicious if rather expensive breakfast buffet (€19 - but that seems to be the going rate for 4 star and above in Dublin)- take advantage of the smoked salmon and other smoked fish plus cheeses, wonderful fresh breads, cheeses, delicious porridge/oatmeal, and wide range of fruits and smoothies...there is also good takeaway coffee available for free.  . Lots of people were ordering the banana waffles which also looked pretty yummy.

Negatives - slightly iffy plumbing - the drench showers can be a bit variable -  and the room I stayed in second time might have had a leak around the basin (or it might have been me being clumsy).  My early morning call was on the phone on the desk  rather than the phone by the bed - a confusion of two lines in the room perhaps...",4,2008,09,07
204,Hard to beat,"Hard to beat the Fitzwilliam if you're looking for a hotel that is four or five star but really delivers on decor, service, quiet and location.   Immediately across from St. Stephen's Green and a light rail station, the hotel is perhaps 50' from the foot of Grafton Street.  Decorated in a contemporary style, the lobby is a great place to sit for tea or a cocktail by the fire.  Rooms are wonderfully appointed with set-up for tea/coffee, music player (CD library available), ipod docking station, sitting area, plasma TV, safe, robes... I could go on.  Check-in was flawless; besides handling the bags efficiently, Reception escorts you to your room and gives you a full rundown of the amenities.  The breakfast is outstanding, served in the modern mezzanine-level restaurant.  Bar also has a nice atmosphere.  When we called for luggage assistance at check-out, the bellman appeared almost instantly.  Didn't hear a bit of noise even though the location is in a popular area.  Only ""misses"":  concierges, though available, were not very knowledgeable regarding the questions we asked; service rather slow in the hotel bar; we disliked the yellow-toned lighting at breakfast.  Still, we'd definately recommend it... our rooms looked out over an inner courtyard and every minute in the room was a respite from the bustle of this fun, active city.",5,2008,08,23
204,A Winner!,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is nicely situated across the street from St Stephen's Green, a nice quiet place to escape the crowds of the city.  The hotel is just steps from Grafton Street with it's many shops & street entertainment.  The Gaeity Theatre is around the corner.  

We arrived at 5:30 am on a Sunday morning.  Not much open at that time.  We were assigned a room at 12 noon which was 2 hrs before check in.  Our air conditioned Executive room was large, comfortable & nicely decorated with their signature purple color.  There was a large window that opened, a flat screen TV, a CD player (there was a list of CD's that you could request if you called the front desk), a coffee/tea maker, iron/board & pants press.  You have to call for ice. 

The closet was large & there was an in-room safe. There was a mini bar, but I asked if some of the contents could be removed so we could buy our own drinks & cheeses...they sent someone right up & removed all the contents. There is a Dunnes Dept Store on the corner that has a grocery & liquor store in the basement.  

The bathroom was nice & had a black granite counter & a super strong rain shower that felt like a massage.  There are glass shelves for your toiletries.  They provide H20 bath products, a sewing kit & bathrobes. The towels were large & thick. The tub was deep & I found it hard to get in & out of it.  There was also flowers & candles in the bedroom & bathroom...Nice touch!  

Chocolates at turn down & a local paper at the door each a.m.  There was a hair dryer, but no plug in the bathroom so had to use it in the bedroom.  Inconvenient!  Large umbrella in the room & others in the lobby...needed since it rained a lot there!   

We had drinks in the Inn on the Green next to reception...the Irish Coffee is good.  We did not eat in either restaurant.  The Citron Cafe is located on the Mezzanine & is open to the lobby below.   

The staff is friendly & helpful.  Ask for a map.  

From the hotel we walked to the Visitor's Center, Trinity College for the Book of Kells, Dublin Castle, Guinness Storehouse (quite a hike but worth it for the view from the Gravity Bar), St Patrick's Cathedral, Christ Church, the pubs of the Temple Bar area with tons of live entertainment, the museums near Merrion Square & other places of interest except for Kilmainham Gaol (the historic jail)...we took the tram from Abbey Street.

We took the Aircoach to & from the airport (7 euro each one way).  It runs every 15 minutes.  The stop going back to the airport is on Dawson St (a short walk from the hotel).

We had a nice Italian meal at Boccaccio Ristorante, 18 Dame St.  Have a specialty coffee & a pastry at Bewley's on Grafton St.",5,2008,08,18
204,"Nice location, Nice hotel","Great location, very nice room and excellent staff. Only niggle was a really cramped breakfast room both physically and with the table size being quite restricted. Real shame as without this it would be soaring into the excellent rating !",4,2008,08,05
204,Noisy Fitz,"Although this hotel advertises itself as being 5 star, I am afraid that you will be dissapointed should you believe it.
The rooms are cramped, the Citron bistro restaurant is not brilliant either for its ""buffet"" style beakfasts nor its dinners and you must make certain that you book a room not streetside as the noise from St Stephens Green revellors gets past the double glazed windows with little trouble, at three in the morning this is a big worry.
We stayed two nights ,luckily on the second night we had such a good time in Temple Bar that any noise passed me by.
We then moved to The Merrion which is a five star and does not have to prove it",2,2008,08,03
204,Excellent hotel - albeit with a few teething problems,"This was very nearly a five-star review for one of the finest five-star hotels I've stayed in.

Best bits:
The staff were absolutely excellent at every juncture.  The rooms (yes, plural...) were absolutely spotless, the porters were friendly and helpful, and the front-desk is probably among the best I've experienced.  
The rooms (plural) were lovely.  The first room we stayed in was a standard double.  It had a good sized bed, plenty of space, modern air-conditioning and an excellent bathroom with a dinner-plate shower in a huge bath.  The second room was a superior room - it had all of the above but was slightly bigger and with a different colour scheme.
The food in the Citreon restuarant was absolutely lovely.  I loved dinner so much, I accidently ate far too much and retired ""hurt"" to the bedroom, forgoing a night in Temple Bar!  We couldn't get a table at the main restaurant, which is supposed to be one of the finest in Dublin.  I must book ahead next time!

Bad bits:
The first room was on the 6th floor of the hotel, which feels like a recent extension to the hotel, and maybe it is a slightly synical one.  We needed to walk up the stairs from the 5th floor to get to our room as the elevator doesn't go to the 6th.  This isn't a massive issue, but does feel a bit cheeky.
The room was great to look at and everything worked.  But there was an unbearably loud hum (like a lorry engine) from the air conditiioning outlets on the roof (not the room's air-con), making sleeping very difficult and watching TV impossible.  The manager moved us to another room, and couldn't have been more helpoful or curtious about it.  He gave me the impression that he's a bit sick of the 6th floor, and it feels like they need to phone their contractor to get the place sorted out...

Overall though, if you avoid one of the 6th floor rooms with the noise problem, this will be one of the best hotel's you've visited.
I'm not a fan of Dublin - I think the place is massively over-rated, over-priced and full of Yanks who are convinced they are in some way Irish.  Cardiff is nicer looking, London has better nightlife and Edinburgh is in a different league altogether.  However, this hotel is a real gem and if you're here on business or pleasure, I highly recommend it.,",4,2008,07,28
204,Good but not fantastic,"We recently booked a 3 day trip to the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a honeymoon, largely based on the reviews we had read on this website. When we arrived the reception staff were very helpful and friendly giving us advice etc. We had chosen a deluxe package with breakfast, the room was a nice size but not spectacular, we had a good view over st stephens green and the bed was big and comfortable. The decor of the room was a little garish for our tastes but neat and tidy. The hotel had left us a box of chocolates and a message from the manger congratulating us on our wedding which was a nice touch. The first issue came the next morning when i went for a shower and there was no hot water, i called reception and they phoned back within 5 minutes to say the boiler was broken, this was at 7 in the morning, as i didn't have to be anywhere i was happy to stay in bed and wait, eventually the hot water came back on at about 10am, and the shower was wonderful. But had i had to leave early in the morning i would have been none too pleased, The other 2 mornings the hot water was fine and the following morning another box of chocolates arrived apologising for the water situation. The only other disapointment was the breakfast which was a buffet type affair, the quality of which i felt was a little poor given the standard and price of the hotel. Overall i felt the hotel was nice and we did enjoy ireland alot, but for the price i came away feeling a little disapointed especially as other hotels we had stayed in from the tripadvisor 'top 20' have been great",3,2008,07,17
204,Great Stay!,"Absolutely enjoyed the Fitzwilliam. The staff and concierge were extremely helpful. The location is excellent, right off of St. Stephen's Green. So close to everything, and great restaurants nearby. Room was clean, although a bit small, but well decorated. We could have stayed longer! I wish all our accommodations were this comfortable! Kudos again to the staff, very friendly & helpful. I will stay here again when I return to Dublin.",5,2008,07,07
204,"Could have been great, but we had bad luck","We are always unlucky with chosing rooms.  The fitzwilliam has had great reviews, but my boyfriend (now fiance!), booked us a deluxe room, without my knowledge (lots of surprises!), but the room itself was rather dissappointing.  Bathroom was a bit pokey, with a small seperate shower from the bath.  We eventually actually opted for a smaller, quieter room and actually downgraded.  If you look at this hotel, make sure you clarify what you want as deluxe isn't doesn't always live up to it, and you may end up paying more than you need as the standard rooms are actually pretty decent.  

For a positive, the breakfasts are fantastic!  Free Irish papers as well.

On another neagitve, it really is a tourist hotel, so doesn't have the boutique feeling of the Dylan (which we have stayed in a couple of times).  I won't be rushing back and am still on the hunt for the perfect Dublin hotel, though I will have very fond memories of Dublin on the 14th June 2008.",3,2008,06,17
204,Fabulous Fitzwilliam,"Being a native Dub we decided to treat oursleves to a night in town to celebrate my birthday.  I cannot fault the Fitzwilliam.  The staff could not do enough for us.  Nothing was a problem.  The room was immaculate and comfortable with plenty of extra luxuries.  I was a bit disappointed that we did not have a view.  As previously stated the courtyard is nice but s only for looking at.  I have dined in the Fitzwilliam bar a few times, it is always pleasant but the bar is a bit remote at the back of the hotel with no view to people watch.  That said location is key to all amenities.  We dined in Shanahans which is a two minute walk in heels : )  Room service breakfast was very tasty.  All in all it was a pleasure.",5,2008,06,17
204,Exceptional service - will return,"I can not fault the service offered at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, on arrival check-in staff were helpful.
Ideal cetral location, with courtesy umbrellas (needed with the weather), breakfast was fast and efficent so i was well fuelled for a days exploring.",5,2008,06,12
204,Where is the hot water,"This is the fourth time I have stayed for a week at this hotel since October 2007 and each time there has been one morning when there was no hot water. On the other three occasions they were able to move me to a room in another wing of the hotel with hot water but not today. There was no hot water at all in the hotel. Clearly, this is a recurring problem that they can't or won't fix properly.  

I stay at this hotel because it is comfortable, the service is good and the location can't be beat. However, I like a hot shower and it appears I need to find another hotel, perhaps the Stephens Green, that is truly four-star.",2,2008,06,12
204,Good location but small room and disappointing breakfast,"This hotel has location:  it is ideally situated if you want to stay right in the heart of Dublin adjacent to one of the main shopping streets and city centre highlights.  It is modern and brightly decorated.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.

On the downside, our bedroom was compact and we were told that, like ours, most of them look out onto the courtyard.  In fact it is a landscaped area between the Hotel and the adjacent building which seemed to be some sort of office/library/work space.  Throwing open the curtains on the first morning I realised that there was an array of people at desks about 40m away looking, what felt like, directly into my room.  The window seat makes that part of the room feel like a mobile holiday home.  The tea and coffee making facilities are of the slide out variety type - you have to take the kettle out to find a power source.  The coffee was instant - and no biscuits:  a bit limited for a hotel of this calibre.  When I was sitting at the desk my wife couldn't pass from one end of the room to the other:  compact, as I say.

Most disappointing for this standard of hotel was the breakfast buffet.  I have had much better in less expensive hotels.  On the first morning, arriving about an hour before breakfast ended, the buffet looked 'tired' and depleted.  Strawberries were less than fresh and after a lot of effort whoelmeal bread was found, but it was stale.

Stay here if you want location and can afford it.",3,2008,06,11
204,Will keep on returning,"This was my second stay and am pleased to be able to report that there was no over-heating issue with the room.  As suspected it was not a recurring problem.

Visiting Dublin frequently, I will return to this address with pleasure.  I like the quality furninshing of the rooms, the bar and the contemporary interior decoration.  And of course the service matches.

I have also reviewed Thornton's separately under its own section.",5,2008,06,08
204,Great stay in Dublin,"Just returned from a great Ireland vacation – and really enjoyed our stay (2 nights) in Dublin at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.

Pros:
•	Room was unavailable when we arrived at 8am from the airport – but hotel was more than accommodating, holding our luggage and even giving us use of another room (a double) while we waited for a twin room to become available
•	Excellent location by park, shopping and many restaurants
•	Modern rooms with comfortable beds (nice pillows), CD player, fresh flowers, flat screen TV, umbrella, robe, hairdryer
•	Bath was spacious and updated with great lighting and H20 bath products
•	Twice daily maid service with tasty chocolate 
•	Lobby was very comfortable with lots of seating and a fireplace 

Cons:
•	Breakfast was not included 
•	Our room was quite a far walk from the elevators
•	We had trouble with our TV remote (even after asking for it to be replaced) and shower didn’t drain properly",5,2008,05,31
204,Very Stylish,"We stayed here for 2 nights, booked through Expedia. The hotel told me they couldnt match Expedia's price so £92 per night per person it was! Great location right at the end of Grafton Street. Very helpful and polite staff. Stylish quite spacious rooms. But like most of Dublin now with the Euro exchange rate meals were expensive, even though the restaurant held a Michelin star. The hotel had parking in their own underground car park a bargain at 10 euros per day. A great hotel in a great location with excellent staff.",4,2008,05,21
204,You get what you pay for,"Just back from a week-long family trip to Ireland and treated ourselves to a Friday night stay at the Fitzwilliam (May 9th).  While pricey, we had a *lovely* stay.  The location on Stephen's Green is perfect for walking anywhere and the service was the best I have ever encountered in Ireland.  We stayed in Room 513 which is small, but beautifully appointed and very quiet - loved the rain shower and never-ending supply of hot water.  Everyone we dealt with was pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast in Citron was delicious - wonderful coffee and scrumptious wholemeal bread and smoked salmon were my favourite bits.  I would definitely recommend the Fitz to anyone and would stay there again in a heartbeat...",5,2008,05,12
204,"Fantastic location, lovely modern hotel","Stayed here for a work christmas do and had a great time. The location of the hotel at the top of Grafton street, the main shopping street in Dublin is second to none. Nice clean modern decor and comfortable rooms. If you stay here you must have a bubble bath it is the biggest deepest bath I have ever used! Had a lovely relaxing massage after a long night on the town. Quite pricy but overall a great stay.",5,2008,03,09
204,Great Hotel and Staff,"My experience with the Fitzwilliam got off to a great start when I called ahead to ask if they would let my husband in early (The hotel was in my name as I was on business)  They were fantastic on the phone, nothing was a problem.  They let my husband have an extremely early check-in which was much appreciated.

The Fitzwilliam has a great location and you can walk to all the tourist places and many restaurants and bars.

We had thier standard room which was a bit small but nicely decorated and funky.  There was a fantastic courtyard view which they lit up with purple lighting at night.  It was extrememly quiet at night.  The bathroom was stone and marble with great toiletries and robes.  They had turndown service at night with very nice chocolates.

The staff across the hotel was excellent, they would even press the elevator buttons.

The only complaint would be that one morning we did have luke warm showers and the water pressure in the shower was too hard.

I would stay here again.",5,2008,03,09
204,Fitzwillam is fantastic,"2nd time at the Fitzwilliam,  In town for Thanksgiving -  Grafton St was at the height of the holiday season. Great hotel room as usual, great staff, try the Irish coffee at the bar downstairs - Best Ive ever had.  Thought about the Clarence however after checking it out in person much prefer Fitzwillam charm as well as location.

Super Hotel, worth every penny !  

Cheers",5,2008,01,14
204,Amazing LaStone Massage,Amazing LaStone Massage from an amazing therapist! Will return for that alone.  Also excellent bar and staff very friendly!,5,2008,01,06
204,"excellent hotel, in center of Dublin, very close to everything","excellent hotel, very good situation in the center of Dubin, 
we stayed here one night for new year eve, and, although we didn't spent a lot of time in the room (it was new year eve after all) it was very comfortable and quiet

it is also very well situated, in st stephen green, with beautiful parc, and very near to temple bar, shopping streets",5,2008,01,02
204,Great rooms and bar,"Just spent two nights at this hotel and it was excellent.  The room was wonderful not at all tired and we loved the bar.  The location is great too, right at the top of Grafton Street.  We will definitely stay here again.",5,2008,01,01
204,Way Overrated,"Wow, I still can’t believe we spent that much for a room with mold, stale smoke smell & in need of major repair. We spent 3 nights total: Found out that the 5th floor is smoking (we had requested non-smoking), found hairs in the linens, towels smelled like vinegar. The Hotel is located across from a beautiful park though and in a great location to walk to most everything.",1,2007,11,15
204,Nice enough but not 5*!,"Our stay at this hotel was nice enough.  We liked the decor, the room , friendliness of the staff and the excellent location of this hotel.  
Having said that my partner and I have stayed at many 5* rated hotels before and we had to admit that we thought this hotel should be classed as a 4* - apologies Fitzwilliam, but you are a very nice 4* at that!",4,2007,11,09
204,Honest Review!!!!!,"Over the past 4 years we have travelled to Dublin once every 2 months. As we live in the sticks we just like the city.

We have stayed in this hotel numerous times along with The Merrion, The Clarence, The Westin, The Shelbourne and The Westbury so we feel that we can give an objective view!

The hotel is in a superb position, over looking St Stephen's Green, at the top of Grafton St. The Luas tram station is just outsite the front door of the hotel, so getting out of the city is not a problem.

Stay in this hotel and, along with most of the others, you are within walking distance of most of the attractions Dublin has to offer. Contrary to previous reviews, Dublin is an easy city to get around.....a general sence of direction is all that is required! If you do get lost.....just ask someone, better still, ask whilst enjoying a pint!

This hotel is located in the Grafton St area. Excellent for shopping and with a wide range of places to eat and drink to suit all budgets. The Temple Bar area is where the party animals tend to go.....never a problem, just take your choice!

The hotel is modern in style. The Reception is friendly and efficient, the rooms are stylish and modern. The breakfast is self service buffet style, with a wide range of cooked and cold items to choose from. Want something different....just ask!

The rooms overlooing the garden tend to be quieter at night. The rooms overlooking St Stephens Green can be a little noisey in the wee small hours. This is just light hearted revelry. As the saying goes, 'Shut your windows Tokyo, Dublins having a party!'

The hotel is not cheap, but by the same token its not expensive. It is a good quality city centre hotel...end of story!",4,2007,11,05
204,not a five star hotel!,"Was expecting more. Probably a five star hotel until you went to your room. We had booked an executive room, whoever designated room 202 as such obviously doesn't get around much. Room was small with no obvious extras to classify it as better than a budget room in a three star hotel.
There was a queue for breakfast no five star hotel would that happen we went elsewhere.
Location was good but i knew that anyway.
Would go back to the mont clare or jurys next time.",3,2007,10,31
204,5* Prices for a 3* hotel.,"Booked this hotel thru Luxury Link. Paid $350 a night for B&B. Room was small. Wake up call didn't happen. Breakfast was very good. Great location. No transformers - went without setting my hair on hot rollers. Ice delivered through room service only. 2 Euro tip for ice everyday. Crazy city, very hard to navigate. Got lost many times. 8 mile trip from the airport took us 2 hours. Streets are confusing and we are both college graduates.  Milano's and Il Primo - excellant. Little Ceasers - edible.",3,2007,10,31
204,Perfect!!,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for one night for my husbands 30th birthday.  Couldn't fault it.  Got a great deal from a website for dinner, B&B and was very impressed.

Staff looked after out luggage both before and after we checked in so we could explore the city without bags and we got upgraded to a sample room too.  Room was excellent.  Don't know what the people on here moaning about shower pressure where on about - we thought it was great and bath filled very quickly too.  Nice fluffy white robes and cd library is an excellent idea.

When staff found out it was my husbands birthday they left a box of choccies in the room for us.  Nice touch.

Throughly enjoyable stay - no waiting for service at any point and a relaxed atmosphere.

Would recommend to a friend and would stay there again if I go back to Dublin.  Walking distance to everything and excellent staff.  What more could you want?!",5,2007,10,23
204,Loved it!,"We booked a double room and on arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was absolutely lovely. Beautifully furnished, great friendly staff, nice breakfast, unbeatable location right beside the top of Grafton St. My only quibble is the bedroom of the suite was a bit cramped, and me being a tall fellow kept banging my knees off the corners of the bed.
Probably the best place place to stay in Dublin.",5,2007,10,20
204,Excellent!,"Have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel, we had a fantastic time, the hotel was amazing, the room service even better!! The staff were extremely helpful , taking time to explain where to go and how to get there and were always at hand. It is situated in the best surroundings, a lovely park across the road, shops, bars, restaurants and amazing galleries at your door step. This was my first trip to ireland and i cant wait to go back  and would definetly stay at the fitzwilliam again.",5,2007,10,19
204,Very moderate rooms.,"Ive just returned from a two day stay at the Fitzwilliam, and the only reason i can see for them justifying the price of this over priced hotel is the location.
Its right at the top of Grafton Street, directly across from St Stephens green, and yards away from my favourite restaurant Shahahans on the green, its an ideal location.
 Unfortunately its massively overpriced due to the very basic rooms, 5 star prices for a 3 star room, it could easily be a Travelodge room, which would be fine if thats what you were paying for!  
The rooms are very moderate, nothing special about them whatsoever, and dont you just hate two single beds pushed together instead of a double?
The rooms are bare, sparse and the toiletries are very poor .
I expect something special in a 5 star hotel bathroom, all in all very dissapointing, because the staff are friendly, efficient and helpful.
There are definitley better options in Dublin for this kind of money.",3,2007,10,10
204,okay,"Disappointing. Overheated room and lukewarm shower. Reception knew there was  a problem but did nothing  until we complained. Not great for 245 euro a night exc breakfast. Shame as the location is good.

Get your own cab to the airport.",2,2007,10,08
204,Great Location and a seamless welcome,"Having booked with lastminute.com for the 'secret hotel' offer I wasn't really expecting that much, but I was very wrong.
For a really good price I was treated to this hotel which was everything a one night stay after a business meeting should be.
The receptionist could not have been nicer or more proffessional if she tried and even showed me to the lift (I could have worked that out for myself but nice gesture anyhow).
The location opposite the Luas and right by the top of grafton street was unbeatable.
The decor in the lobby was fantastic, although I have to say I think they could have tried to be a bit more adventurous on the slightly bland interior design of the rooms, a really minor point in a generally good-looking hotel.
On checking out I was remembered and chatted to by the same receptionist, no mean feat in a large hotel - very impressive.
Overall, what a nice surprise, am very much hoping that this special offer is run again!!",5,2007,10,05
204,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and I have just returned after a weekend at the Fitzwilliam hotel.  This hotel is rated a 5* and well deserves it.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Check in/out quick and the entire hotel is immaculate.  Breakfast was a well varied choice of continental or full Irish and very nice.  We ate in the hotel restaurant one evening (Citron) and although a little overpriced was excellent with plenty of choice and very relaxing.  The hotel is ideally located at the top of Grafton Street, which leads onto O’Connell street and Temple Bar, therefore is ideal for shopping and eating out and there is plenty of Irish bars for one or two pints of Guinness,  The city buses and the airport link buses depart from just around the corner. We took a taxi to the hotel from the airport for 35E but it’s just as easy to get the airlink bus for 7E per person.
Are only gripe with this hotel was our lack of hot water in the shower.  The bath and shower run independently thank goodness.  We told the reception several times about our problem with the shower and a maintenance man came to the room twice, but after sorting the hot water in the shower we then had no pressure in the shower and no cold water in the bath, The water problem in the bath was sorted but the shower problem was never resolved before we left.
Saying this, we didn’t let this ruin our weekend and the reception was more than apologetic.
Last point.  Our room was on the 6th floor, but the lift only takes you to the 5th floor and then you have to take the stairs.  Not a big problem unless you have walking difficulties.
Great hotel and would definitely book it again if staying in Dublin.",4,2007,10,03
204,Very pleasant,"My fiancee and I stayed here for a long weekend and I was very pleased with every aspect of the hotel. The front desk staff were very helpful as was the concierge. Room service was prompt and the food excellent. Yes it was a little pricey but it's in a capital city and is in an excellent location.

My only minor gripes were the bed, which wasn't the most comfortable, and the fact that the window blinds didn't work - Nothing to write home about though.

Would I stay again? Absolutely. I wanted to give it four and a half but had to give it five as four wasn't sufficient to do it justice.",5,2007,09,28
204,Lovely hotel - but sort out the heating please!,"My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam recently. This is a modern high class hotel and so has all the amenites you might expect (except for a pool). Our room was on the 5th floor and both it and the bathroom were spotlessly clean. We were on a B&B basis - breakfasts were excellent.
Personally I wasn't keen on the open plan type of restaurant which overlooks reception but I suppose thats a personal preference
The bar woud probably have been very pleasant and with plenty of atmosphere had it not been for the stifling heat in it. The air-con didn't appear to be working and the waiters didn't seem to know why not (they seemed as uncomfortable in it as the guests).This lasted for all 3 days of our stay which I found strange in a hotel of this class
As to location this is ideal for shopping and historic buildings which are all close by. Some great nearby restaurants too - try Il Posto or Pepoloe's which are each within a 5 minute walk - but you'll need to book.
Parking is very conveniently underground at the hotel. At 10 euros per day it's cheap for central Dublin but you'd think that the hotel could perhaps throw the parking in given their high room rates!
Overall if this hotel sorts out its heating issues its a great place to stay - though I thought it was a bit overpriced at 230 Euros per room per night even given its 5 star status
Would I stay again? Probably yes, but there are plenty of other good alternatives nearby too.

204,Great hotel- fantastic staff,"I took my boyfriend to this hotel in March 2007 for his Birthday. We stayed from the 15th Mar- 17th Mar. As it was also St Patrick's day, you can imagine Dublin was very busy. I have been to Dublin before but it was my Boyfriend's first time. This hotel is out of this world. The location is great. The staff are outstanding. The breakfast was the best breakfast we have ever had. The scrambled egg is delicious! The room was very spacious and spotlessly clean. Mini bar was fully stocked each day, and very reasonably priced. The weather was not great but we found that this hotel had umbrellas available for you to use!!! I suffer with a bad ankle and after a day sight seeing, got back to the hotel with a bit of a limp. As we entered the lift, the manager ran over and commented on my limping. He told us if I needed anything, ice, pain killers or a doctor to call down to reception. I thought that customer service was fantastic!!! When we checked out on the 17th we were able to leave are bags there for the day (as our flight was not until 10:30pm). As it was St Patrick's day, some roads were closed for the parade. Despite this the hotel had no problem getting us a taxi to take us to the airport. We didn't want to leave!!

204,Great stay,"I am currently staying here at the moment and most recently before this in June of this year. Have really enjoyed all stays . The concierge and bar staff are excellent  and made my stay in june , by arranging a special meal for my girlfriend and i . As with past reviews , i find the water pressure in the shower way too high  , but my girlfriend loves it so i suppose its down to personal preference. A fine hotel.

204,Satisfied - not amazed,"We stayed at this hotel for one night during our stay in Dublin.  Location was great, but rooms were small, as expected.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Decor was like a modern hotel.  In our opinion, not worth the money we paid to stay there.
",3,2007,07,28
204,This hotel flatters to deceive,"A night at the Fitzwilliam Hotel is a classic lesson in the challenge of matching form and function.

The form element has clearly been a focus for the owners.  The design is modern, perhaps even cutting edge, with lots of clean lines, stone floors, minimal drapes and simple colours (white, brown, white, brown,...er).

The mezzanine restaurant, Citron, is intended as a lively place with a bank of yellow neon lights supporting a wall length mirror on one side, and a curvy waist high wall affording at view down to reception below.

It's all extremely pleasing on the eye, and my eye gives it top marks.

Alas, however, the function is not quite in the same class.  One might say that if the design of a hotel is its 'compelling difference' then the functions should be its 'brilliant basics'.  These are the things a hotel must get right for you to simply enjoy staying there, and without them, all the beauty in the world is wasted.  This is sadly the case at the Fitzwilliam.

The rooms are, as a previous reviewer mentioned, small.  I was first delighted to be upgraded to a super-duper-VIP-executive room (or something like that, anyway) and later terrified when, sat in said super-duper-room, I considered what I might have ended up with.  Nevertheless, size isn't everything apparently, and a small room that functions perfectly is a good room.

This room wasn't good.  The walls on both sides are stud walls, which means that unless huge attention is paid to soundproofing, you can hear your neighbours picking their nose.  The lack of soundproofing is exacerbated by the wooden floors and empty walls.  Sound reverberated around me.  A mobile phone down the corridor sounded like it was in my doorway and a neighbourly shower seemed to be the onset of the Victoria Falls.  The fridge wasn't keeping anything cold, rather it was simply a useful automated billing machine.  

Finally, the aforementioned Citron looked good but those neon lights....boy are they hot to sit in front of.

My last whinge (sorry, sorry) was that the environmental awareness of the hotel was a disaster.  Every room appears to be left after cleaning with the air conditioning running (I compared notes with colleagues), which is not only wasteful but also totally unnecessary.  This is Dublin, for god's sake, not the Kalihari.  Also, when I arrived, every single light was on.  Every one.  And I didn't spot a single energy efficient bulb lurking amongst the sea of low voltage lights.

So, this hotel was nice, but definitely form over function.  If you want eye candy book now.  If you want everything a hotel should do perfectly, think again.

One thing though, the staff were a delight from begining to end.  Hurrah for that.

204,poor hotel not 5* at all,"My girlfriend and i are a young couple in our early 20's im mentioning this as we were the youngest couple in the hotel, although this doesnt usually bother me as we were there for eachother and not not the stuck up idiots in the hotel when the staff joined in it was a bit of an issue. As you will see when booking this its not a cheap hotel especially with the expensive breakfast not included with the price.
Only staying for two nights we had a sports bag between us which the Concierge almost wrestled from my arm.. it was a light bag i told him but he insisted in taking it.. we were greeted by a very friendly receptionist and was checked in very quickly (Good point) the room was very nice bit small almost like an updated travel lodge although the bathroom was very nice.. the concierge then knocked on the door and carried my small bag in.. he then found reasons for staying in the room waiting for his tip.. Im a generous man however i wasnt going to tip a guy for carrying a bag i was happy to carry myself.. he then decided to give me a tour of my room....yes im being serious so after the tour of the 1 bed room and 5 euros later he left us to get on with the trip.
we ate in the citeron restarant (WOULD DEF RECOMEND) and had some really nice drinks in the bars. Being our first trip to dublin we wanted some help from the concierge as to where to go again looked at us like we didnt belong... which i then reminded him that we were guests in the hotel so treat us how we should be treated.
Word of advise find your own cab home.. the company that the hotel use doubles your fair back to the airport.

204,Grat Fitz,"We found the staff very friendly and helpful. The Concierge was most efficient in helping with directions through the Dublin one way system! This hotel is an ideal location for exploring the main areas of Dublin and for shopping , night life and eating out. Our room was modern, clean with the best shower ever! We liked the fact that the hotel car park was easy to locate and provided comfortable access in and out of the hotel.  Well worth a stay for a city break.
",4,2007,07,16
204,"Great location,helpful staff,great bed","The Fitzwilliam provides a terrific location for sightseeing & convenience to basic needs.    The staff was incredibly helpful from providing maps, taking our car at curbside, giving directions. Our floor had a daily supply of apples by the elevators. Free internet connection in the room. We had a room with a balcony overlooking St.Stephen's Green..and we had breakfast each day.  Downside..a little pricey but I found the service was so good I didnt' mind. Those who don't like trendy might not feel comfortable but I saw all types coming and going.  The only downside, the cleanup staff will knock on your door  and open it pretty quickly if you don't have the do not disturb sign out. It happened twice the first day (then we figured it out) .  I would recommend the hotel for those who like a little luxury and a lot of convenience.
",4,2007,07,15
204,Loved this hotel...,"My sisters, my neice, and my daughter stayed here for two nights, July 1st and 2nd.  We enjoyed our stay here very much. This was a great hotel and it's very well located -- right at the end of Grafton St. (great shopping) and across from St. Stephen's Green.  The rooms had a very modern, boutique feel.  We had 3 people in one room, and it wasn't tight.  The water pressure in the bathroom was the best we had in Ireland.  The food in the restuarant was very good.  One of the best meals we had in Ireland.  One of my sisters thought it was great that we had ""free"" internet connection in the rooms.
",5,2007,07,10
204,Our best bit? Checking out.......,"This hotel needs to be re-classified, as 5-star is NOT appropriate. The rooms are mainly small, dated and ill-equipped for a self proclaimed ""luxurious hotel"". Staff are slow to respond to any requests (if indeed they respond at all). We were forced to move rooms twice in the space of 3 nights due to noise from the adjacent night club, hmm, failed to mention that minor point when we booked!! Will not be returning, nor recommending to anyone.
",1,2007,07,01
204,Wonderful hotel - Excellent location !,"I stayed 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam and they were wonderful. The service was by far the best I have had in a long time! The location was perfect for the tourist who wants to be right near great shopping, restuarants, and major attractions. I highly recommend this hotel!
",5,2007,06,23
204,Very nice stay,"We were quite happy with our choice of hotels for our one night in Dublin.  The location was excellent - at least from what we could tell.  We experienced a bit of jet lag this time.....  That said, I'm a very light sleeper (even at home) at night, but I had a great night there and we had even taken a nap in the afternoon.  

The bathroom in our room was not overly large, but as I have read in many reviews, the shower was excellent.  (My hubby did comment that the water bill must be rather high though.)  I had to try the HUGE tub out - did leave me laughing though.  I'm a bit on the short side and the tub was a bit on the long side.  I was looking forward to a lovely soak, but the tub was so long and deep, I couldn't lay back without sliding down in!  

Our room was on the 6th floor - that was also a bit amusing as the lift only goes to the 5th floor and then you take the stairs.  Not a big deal - they brought our luggage up to us.  I did not hear a peep from either of the rooms next to us or the hall!  

The staff was very friendly.  I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again on future visits.  As mentioned in previous comments, the lobby and room spaces are small, but who actually spends time in them anyway?   Breakfast was included in our rate and that was fine also.  We arrived at the hotel around 10am and while we had emailed ahead and asked if we could check in early, we were told a room would not be ready, but a hospitality room would be available.  We were nicely surprised when told our room was ready when we did arrive.
",4,2007,06,22
204,Wonderful Experience,"My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel.  The hotel was centrally located and very well maintained.  What most impressed me, however was the service we received while we were there.  Arriving at 7:00 in the morning, we were very early for our 2:00 check in.  The hotel, booked solid the night before, was very hospitable, even offering to open the kitchen early for us while we waited for a room which they made available for us by 10:30.  They also offered us the use of a day room, complete with shower, in which we could freshen up.
",5,2007,06,20
204,The Fitzwilliam was fine,"I recently booked a night in the Fitzwilliam in Dublin and while I was a bit disappointed by the room (it was fairly small and smelled smokey) as I had upgraded to an executive level room, the service personnel were fantastic and the location is perfect, just off Grafton Street, with plenty of food and drink located nearby too. 

I would definitely stay here again, but probably not bother to upgrade my room.
",3,2007,06,14
204,Poor value for the price,"When I read the other positive reviews on this site I thought I'd gotten a really good deal with my 195 euro (ex breakfast) promotional rate from the hotel's website. But I ended up being extremely disappointed with the poor value for money I received. 

For starters, I would say that this is NOT a 5 star hotel - definitely a 4 star. The bedroom in the standard room that we received was extremely small - only a tiny amount of space around the bed and window seat and that was it. And while you could get toiletries like toothbrushes and shaving kits that aren't normally supplied at lower grade hotels, you had to call and request these extras - which you wouldn't be aware of if you didn't read the directory. This seemed unnecessarily stingy to me.

That aside, I probably still would have thought the hotel was OK if it wasn't for the following factors, which really affected our stay:

* I had specifically requested when making the reservation that we receive a room away from the elevator. Instead we got given room 210 which was right behind it. The noise coming from the elevator was extensive - we could hear the lift going up and down, the door chimes when it stopped on our floor and people entering and exiting all day and night. When we complained about this upon checkout we were told simply that this request wasn't registered, even though I'd entered these details myself when booking and had an email confirmation to that effect. Not good enough for a 5 star.
* I had also requested a room on a high floor, but room 210 was on the second floor. I could hear music coming from the bar/club downstairs quite clearly until early Sunday morning, which is specifically what I wanted to avoid. Plus, we looked straight onto the hotel garden, so had other guests seated right outside our window when they went outside - really offputting when you just want to relax in your room. Again, not good enough for a 5 star when I'd gone to the effort to request an alternative.
* It was impossible to have a hot shower using the fixed shower head unless the pressure was turned up to full. This resulted in us having to shower in ankle deep water every time, and being Aussies, we were horrified to think of how much water must be wasted this way each day.

If these issues had not occurred I'm sure that I would have felt that the 195 euro promotional rate, whilst dear, was reasonable value for the location in Dublin. As it stands, you'd be better off going for a 4 star hotel - it'd be cheaper and you'd get the same, if not better service.

204,A fantastic hotel!,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for four nights at the beginning of June. This is an exceptional hotel. On arrival we were greeted by Jennifer who set the standard for what was to become a truly memorable stay. I think Jennifer is Head of front of House , she exuded a genuine warm welcome and her impeccable manner and professionalism shone through.
All of the other staff we met were also very pleasant and helpful
Our room was fantastic with a magnificent view overlooking St Stephen's Green. The Concierge were most helpful and accommodating too.
If you are thinking of somewhere special to stay in Dublin look no further than the Fitzwilliam.
",5,2007,06,05
204,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed 5 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and were completely happy.  The staff is very courteous and helpful, the room clean, nice size bathroom with nice toiletries, and a perfect location.  

The hotel is located right at the top of Grafton Street and across the street from St. Stephen's Green, 10 minute walk to Temple Bar, and Dublin Castle.  We took the DART train to Malahide to visit the castle there.  We also took the Hop On/Hop Off bus tour and enjoyed The Guinness Storehouse and Kilmainham Gaol.  

A tip - book The Guinness Storehouse tour on line so you can zip past the lines when you get there.

It was worth the price.
",5,2007,06,01
204,The Location Alone is Worth Every Penny!,"We had just 1 night to spend in Dublin and so wanted to ensure we were in a nice hotel in a central location. We hit the bullseye with this hotel!!!

It really is in a fantastic location - facing the peace of St Stephen's Green, 10 seconds walk from the bottom of Grafton Street and a pleasant 5 or 10 minute walk to Temple Bar and 5 minutes walk to the nearest stop for the various city bus tours. We really could not have picked a better hotel in this respect. 

The hotel itself was perfectly pleasant. Nice, clean rooms and  very helpful staff. 

The price of the hotel may may me think twice about booking for a longer stay, because it isn't the cheapest of places, but for a night
or two it is pretty perfect!",5,2007,05,22
204,Wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam,"What a great hotel!  We had a nice bed and breakfast package plus a great dinner.  The view of the park (we had a top floor room) was fantastic, the staff attentive, the food amazing (i especially loved the banana pancakes).  The decor was nice and modern. We really recommend a stay at this hotel anytime!
",5,2007,05,21
204,Is this really a 5 star?,"This hotel is nice. The staff are nice. The bedrooms were nice (although our corner room was not a nice size). The public rooms were
nice. The drinks were nice. The food was nice. The decor- yes that was nice too. Even the discounted rate obtained from the website was....nice. 

Indeed if you want somewhere nice you could do no better. If, however, you should want somewhere special look elsewhere. We went to both the Merrion and the newly renovated Shelbourne whilst we we in Dublin.  Both seem to have something special. The sheer class exuded by the Merrion and the glitz and history of the Shelbourne produced something special, the je ne sais quoi, a certain edge that you should really expect from a 5 star property, and that was sadly missing in the Fitzwilliam.

True the position of the Fitzwilliam is good but for me that just wasn't enough.",3,2007,05,17
204,Complicated Staff,"The hotel is amazing, got a bar that keep going on until late... and it's very well located. But the staff was so confused when i was there. I was with a big group, and they simply lost a booking of an extra room that i asked in the afternoon! I didn't have too much time to enjoy the premises, but seems to be a great hotel.

204,great location,"Hi i am just back from a night in the Fitzwilliam. I found the location to be excellent during the day.The hotel sits at the top of grafton st overlookig st stephens green right in the middle of all the shops and bars.However we got a room which overlooked the green and found that at night the main st got very noisy as the pubs and clubs closed.During my stay i found all the staff to be very helpful especially at reception. The room had everything you needed however it was quite small but all in all i found the stay most enjoyable.
",4,2007,05,09
204,Excellent all around,"I do agree that it is more of a four star than a five star, but the service is excellent, the location is FANTASTIC (shopping, parks, great restaurants nearby, etc). I have stayed in many many many expensive hotels and none had the service available at the Fitzwilliam. Chocolates on the pillows, great shower and huge bath. Wonderful shampoos, luxe bathrobes, heavenly bed. We also had a balcony and small sitting room. It was the perfect place to relax and unwind. You will not be disappointed. Be sure to go to the Ely restaurant on the other side of the park. Very good. Delightful all around!!! Do Not Rent A Car From Murray Europecar.",5,2007,05,03
204,Great place if you're not paying!,"I stayed here as part of a working visit to Dublin and was extremely happy with the accommodation. I booked at late notice so was limited as to my options so knew it would cost more than I would normally pay out, even on expenses. I was happy with the room, mine was large and the bathroom was very well equipped. The toiletries provided were better than any I have used in other hotels I have stayed in, and I've yet to come across the same brand again. I wished I had more time to enjoy the wonderful breakfast on offer but I had a plane to catch and the Dublin traffic to dodge. One tip I would pass on - don't let the hotel call their usual taxi firm, I ended up with a very strange driver who cried on the way to the airport. I really didn't know what was going on or what the problem was, it was quite scary.
",5,2007,05,03
204,"a good, but not great, choice","I must say similarly to other reviewers I have somewhat mixed feelings about this place. Positives-clean, comfortable, wonderful shower, friendly staff, quiet at night, very central good location in
dublin's salubrious southside Negatives-expensive for what it is(it's
a decent 4 star hotel not a 5 star as it suggests), bland rooms (ours was pretty small too), furnishings slightly scruffy, cracked tiles in bathroom and the floor flooded when we used the shower, not much character

Overall there was nothing really badly wrong with this place but it didn't do that much for me either. I might stay here again, but i'll
definitely look at other places too. If you're in Dublin on a short break or business I would say it is fine but if you want something really special you might want to try somewhere else.
",4,2007,04,24
204,Very smart but expensive,"We stayed here for 2 nights in march having booked a very last minute break. The hotel is extremely expensive for what it is, but very nice. It's location is perfect, right at the top of Grafton Street so close to everything. The staff were very welcoming and the room was big, spotlessly clean and nicely decorated with an extremely comfortable bed. The bathroom was great (truly, one of the best showers I've ever experienced). We didn't try either, but there's a smart hotel bar and a Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel. Overall this is a luxurious hotel but we prefer to stay in slightly more quirky, boutique style hotels and this is definitely not that. It would be ideal for people on business or for those who like big, expensive chain hotels.
",4,2007,04,20
204,"Great Location, Good Quality","The Fitzwilliam is right at the end of Grafton St and directly across from St Stephen's Green - a terrific location. As a single woman, I felt safe walking between the hotel and Temple Bar at night. The room was typical of a boutique hotel - modern, spare, but stocked with all the amenities you might want (except there's no food, only alcohol in the mini-bar). The bathroom was great and had a large tub with a second, separate shower head for if you're taking a bath and want to rinse off. I loved the bath products and stocked my suitcase with them for future travels. The service at the desk was very solicitous, but the concierge was constantly changing and none of them seemed especially concerned with guests' needs. One drawback - checking email via the TV was very difficult and not with the time or the charge. I booked a standard room via Hotwire for $212 and that was a good price - I wouldn't pay more than that to stay here.
",4,2007,04,19
204,Overrated Hotel - will not return,"We stayed at The Fitzwilliam to celebrate a specical occasion for two nights in mid-April. Some staff members were friendly and professional, others were not.  The room itself was a good size, but nothing great - very spare and worn furniture.  Room was not serviced by 3:00 pm, had to call for maid service. We were consistently seated away from Irish patrons during visits to the hotel bar (do the Irish now dislike Americans, too?), and we received poor service with an unfriendly attitude from an Eastern European female server.  The concierge staff was good. There's really just nothing special about this hotel other than its central location. The renowned Irish hospitality we experienced during previous trips to this country was sorely lacking.
",2,2007,04,16
204,"Pleasant, peaceful stay in a quality hotel","Family stayed here in two rooms for four nights in March. Thoughtful and helpful staff, most efficient. Quiet, clean rooms with spare, modern decor. Quality furnishings. Ample storage space. Comfortable beds. Cozy windows seats overlooking modernist garden. Powerful showers. Pleasant bar. Light and airy lobby. Dependable broadband and wifi. 

A peaceful oasis,  located at the southern end of busy Grafton area; tourists can walk to all city center sights, and yet have quiet in the evening.  It's a 10 minute walk from Pearse station, should you want to take the DART out of town for sightseeing.

Did not eat in the hotel; it is close by several coffee houses and many good restaurants are nearby. I feel that this was a good value, and  would stay here again.
",5,2007,03,27
204,Another very good stay,"We were at the Fitzwilliam for a weekend stay (room only).  We had stayed there before and liked the hotel and the location.

The staff was very friendly and efficient. Nothing was a trouble to the concierge and we were impressed with how the staff seemed to enjoy working there.

Our room overlooked the gardens (St Stephens Green) and the decor was just as shown in the hotel photos. The shower and big bath are great and the room amenities are of a high standard.  The only negative was the noise on the Saturday night coming from outside.  It did not keep me awake but I was aware of it.

On both nights we went a very short distance to dinner and Shanahans lived up to our expectations.  For breakfast we did not eat in the hotel but found a small cafe where we could eat outside.  The shops are right next door to the hotel and the park was beautiful to look out on and to walk through.

When we go back to Dublin we will stay here.
",4,2007,03,26
204,Great Locn,"Just spent a weekend at the Fitzwilliam. Fantastic location - Just 2 mins walk from Grafton street, as well as numerous restaurants. The staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Did find the bedroom small however. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable experience
",5,2007,03,16
204,A very friendly hotel,"We celebrated by husband's birthday in Dublin and after much contemplation of hotels picked the Fitzwilliam, primarly because of its positive reviews. The champagne I had ordered for my husband was waiting for us along with a very nice message from front of house.  The receptionist set the standard for service when we checked in - she couldn't have been friendlier as she showed us to our room.  Such friendliness and courtesy was consistent amongst all of the staff we encountered from the concierge to the housekeeping staff.  

The room, although not huge was very tastefully furnished and decorated, and very quiet. It overlooked a courtyard which meant we had the benefit of a central location without the road noise which often accompanies it.  Plenty of wardrobe space, CD player and lovely bathroom: the room lacked nothing. 

The hotel has the feel of a fairly small and intimate hotel and we loved the contempary air to it. The location is perfect - at the end of Grafton Street, close to some trad Irish pubs and across the road from St Stephens Green for a lovely Sunday morning stroll.
Our room rate didn't include breakfast but we decided to eat it in the hotel on Saturday morning. The range is super but the scrambled eggs were so solid they could be sliced. I would recommend eating breakfast elsewhere for better vfm. Other than that perfect and very highly recommended!",5,2007,03,15
204,Perfect City Centre Location,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel 3 times when on business in Ireland and must say, this is the perfect hotel for both business and personal visits to Dublin.

-Hotel is located right in front of St. Stephens Green, at the foot of Grafton Street where there are a lot of shops and restaurants.  Temple Bar, Trinity College and other attractions are a short walk away.  You can catch the Hop-On/Hop-Off bus at the top of Grafton street (5 min walk) to take a tour of Dublin city.

-If you are so inclined, the Sporting Emporium (Casino) is also a five minute walk away.

-The hotel premises are pristine.

-I've always stayed at a standard Double Room which is quite good for European standards.  The Fitzwilliam has the best showers in Dublin that I have encountered.  You have to try it to appreciate.

-Room service was okay and sufficient for late night snacks.  There is a complimentary breakfast (depends on your booking I suppose) at the Citron restaurant which is good as well.

-Service is top-notch and the concierge will assist you with directions/maps and whatever you need to get around the city.

-One nice small touch to their service is the availability of large umbrellas to borrow when it's raining.  I've been caught without one several times and they are always ready to loan you one.  Much needed in Ireland where you can experience four seasons in a day.

Enjoy!
",4,2007,02,27
204,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel was fantastic, the staff couldn't have done more for us.  We only stayed two nights but wish it had been longer.

We didn't eat in the hotel but it looked lovely, the location of this hotel could not have been better.  A stone throw from the high street and a 5 - 10 minute walk max to Temple Bar, where all the night life is.  We would go back tomorrow.
",5,2007,02,23
204,Still a quality hotel seven years on,"This was my second stay at the Fitzwilliam. The first was in 2000, and I was smitten then.

It's changed very little and I mean that in a good way. The place looks like new. The room was spotlessly clean and the entire hotel has a feeling of solidity about it which few modern buildings have.

Bed was great, bathroom really good. As others have mentioned, the power shower is perhaps a little TOO powerful for my liking! Had no problem with noise from other rooms. This time I was in a (cheaper) garden room which was really nice and peaceful.

The negatives? Room was bizarrely hot unless aircon was on. The safe is tiny and certainly not big enough for a laptop which I'd expect in a hotel of this class. Also free internet access is wired rather than wireless.

Only had breakfast once which was fine but pricey as you'd expect. Service at front desk and at breakfast was fast, efficient and friendly.

I'll certainly stay at the Fitzwilliam the next time I'm in Dublin. Recommended.
",5,2007,02,20
204,Very Very Good,"We stayed at the end of January, having booked an extremely good Dinner, Bed and Breakfast rate.
We only booked a standard room, but were upgraded to a Junior Suite free of charge and without asking.
The room was very contemporary, spotless and luxurious ( and being a suite it had a separate  living/dining room and bedroom).
The bathroom was of a similar standard ( what a powerful shower!)
Dinner was included in the rate. It was 3 course in the Citron Restaurant and of an exceptional standard, the fillet steak was so tender and cooked perfectly.
Breakfast in the room was also good ,although not as good as at the Westin.
The staff were courteous and efficient at all times.
For the price I would stay at this hotel again even without the free room upgrade.
",4,2007,01,29
204,Ideal Location,"First of all, the hotel is located at Dublin`s best area. Very close to stylish shops and bars. Everthing is at walking distance makes this hotel ideal place to stay for a weekend. The most amazing part is the power shower in the bathroom which is the best that I have never seen before. The staff is very professional and friendly. The only weak point is the bar which looks old and out of date. This does not go together with the rest of the hotel which is very trendy and full of good taste...
",4,2007,01,17
204,€96.00 for breakfast!!!!!!!!!!,"This hotel is in a perfect location with the buzzing atmosphere of Graffton Street practically 2 mins walk, Temple Bar bars/pubs/clubs a 10 min walk and the famous O'Connell street a 15 min walk.  The hotel staff are efficient and friendly, someone on hand to open the door as soon as you arrive, whish your bag off and take you to the lift.  When you walk in to your hotel room you are invited by a wave of classical music already playing on your stereo.  The bathrooms are lovely, the shower is amazing, I thought my head was going to explode - its definately a ""power shower"".  The bath is HUGE....width and length and fills up in a nano second!  (Definately enough room for 2 of you and no fighting for the tap end as the taps are in the middle!! - if only all baths came like that!)  The only problem in the room for me, which might not apply to all....is that I love a duvet on my bed and here they have a sheet and blanket....nothing to complain about though because after doing the Temple Bar obligitory pub crawl I would of slept outside on the cobble road and not woken up once!  Do not expect cheap prices for drinks in this area, maybe its because we didnt visit any pubs outside of the so called ""tourist area"", expect to pay about €4.70 for a pint of Guiness.

Now on to my only real rant about the hotel.  I thought i had booked a B&B rate for the hotel so i guess its my fault for not checking but I ended up having to pay €96.00 for 2 days breakfast for 2 people.  Now to me they would have to get bacon from the queens pigs, buy tomatoes made of gold and serve it to me whilst giving me a back massage and a pedicure whilst fanning me and serving me grapes!!!!!  Directly 2 mins walk to the left and I could of had a decent breakfast for €7.50.
I didnt mind paying the charge because obvisouly i hadnt booked the correct rate however i dont know how they can charge such a ridiculous price for a cooked breakfast!!!

So.....if you are going to dublin and staying in the Fitzgerald hotel im sure you will have a fabulous time.  However, dont forget to ask them if breakfast is included in your room rate BEFORE you go ahead and gorge yourself on some Irish sauted potaoes!!!

204,Almost Perfect,"We have just arrived back after spending 3 nights at the Fitz for our Honeymoon, and on the whole we really enjoyed staying there.  The service throughout our stay was really excellent.

We arrived to a friendly concierge who promptly took our bags and directed us to Reception. The lady on Reception was nice and welcoming, and she upgraded our room, which was a nice touch. 
Unfortunately, although the room design was nice, it wasn't particularly well decorated, which was surprising for a 5 star hotel.

We booked a meal in their Citron Restaurant, and the food was very nice.

The Hotel is in an excellent location, on the corner of St Stephens Green and Grafton Street, right next to Dublins Shops, Bars and Restaurants.

If you want a special stay and have some money to spend, stay here!

204,An excellent choice!,"I stayed for two weeks for business. I enjoyed the Fitzwilliam and would definitely stay there again. The bathroom was out of this world!

Pros: exceptional location; wonderful service -- the airline lost my luggage and they actually called to follow up for me; classy, non-tacky carpeting; the best hotel bathroom I've ever stayed in (beats the top 5 star hotels in San Francisco), both in terms of the shower and tub; thoughtful touches -- chocolates, umbrella, apples, etc. The gym was new and totally fine, and the hotel looks much prettier in person than in pictures.

Cons were mostly little things: room carpeting was a little worn; room service food was horrible and slow, and there could have been more to choose from; no wifi in the rooms and the internet cord could have been longer; the bed and towels were nice by European standards, but not American; sporadic replenishment of bathroom goodies -- one day qtips, the next day no qtips; the walls were somewhat thin -- could hear the baby in the room next to me babbling.

204,What a difference a year makes,"We stayed at this hotel a year ago and thought the staff were very surly and unhelpful especially the concierge's.

After deciding to book a last-minute pre Christmas break we stayed here again due to its excellent location. This time we booked a room at the rear of the hotel as we found the Green view rooms to be too noisy last time. The room was as expected, although a little too warm and stuffy for us. The aircon was a little weak and ineffective and the heating was on full blast despite it not being particularly cold outside.

The biggest difference however was the staff. They couldnt do enough this time and bent over backwards to help. The concierge was a revelation. One called Robert was outstanding and really tried to get us a dinner reservation when everywhere was packed. He did too, so thanks Robert. Last year the concierge wouldnt even get us a taxi on departure and directed us to hump our bags 100 yards to a taxi rank. This time, not only did they book one for us, but they found us in the bar when it came and our bags were already loaded. Perfect. 

So I would recommend this hotel now they have sorted the staff out. The location is excellent and the rooms are very functional although slightly bland. Awesome shower. Breakfast still too busy, so we ate out in a cafe. Cooked to order and a quarter of the price. The Inn on the Green is also great, although a little cramped when busy.
",4,2006,12,11
204,One of the best,"I chose the Fitzwilliam for the location and the great reviews on this website.  I was not disappointed,  The room was beautiful:  well-decorated and clean.  The shower was probably one of the best I have ever had - great pressure.  There was twice daily maid service with turndown and chocolates.

The breakfast buffet was 25 euros which was pretty steep.  There is a bar in the hotel which has late service.

My bill did have a few mini-bar extras which were taken off the bill promptly after explaining that we did not use the minibar, so no big deal.

The staff were incredibly professional and courteous.
",5,2006,11,29
204,Great location,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam with my wife for 3 nights. The room was very comfortable, superbly clean and attended to twice-daily by maid service. The decor was plush although one or two bathroom tiles were loose and the 'fresh flowers' comprised a couple of green stalks that did not (and will never) support anything more than a few small buds!
The Citron Cafe at the Fitz provided excellent cuisine and value for money.

If 20 odd euros is too much for breakfast, the nearby St Stephen's Shopping Mall has an outlet which provides all you will need to eat  for around 7 euros, and this is available until noon.

The location is first class being within walking distance of most of the city centre's main attractions and shopping areas.

Overall this is a fine hotel with very friendly and helpful staff.
",4,2006,11,20
204,a bit dissapointed,"I  stayed at this hotel for two reasons, its location and the fact that it was a well reccomended 5 star hotel. Although staff were fine , the room was clean and the bathroom impressive I wasleft with a feeling of disapointment. The common areas of the hotel are small and not very inviting, there is no real guest lounge to chill and have a drink and just hang. The room was fine but certainly no better than a good average.I wouldnt stay again as there are so many hotels in Dublin that give a better hotel experience.
",3,2006,11,03
204,"lovely hotel, great location","This is a lovely hotel with excellent staff who were  friendly, professional and very efficient.  Probably the best staff i've come across on hotel reception. 

I can't think of any bad thing to say about it!

Room was lovely, bathroom spotless and good size, very comfy bed...  location is excellent for shopping and sightseeing.
",5,2006,10,24
204,"Great location, nice room","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights in October. Although we booked months in advance, the room we requested was not available. They offered us a lower room rate including breakfast each morning in return for remaining in our smaller room with no views. The room was clean, modern and quiet. However, the real reason to stay at this hotel is the location, perfectly set at the end of Grafton Street overlooking the Green. Another mention is for the shower, the best water pressure I have ever had in a hotel room. The overhead spray was SO strong it was like a massage. May be too strong for some. The bed was average, thin cotton comforter and flat pillows, but there are extra pillows in the closet. The bar was also nice and breakfast offered a large variety. We splurged for dinner at the hotel restaurant Thornton's, which was excellent! The service was outstanding and the food was one of the best meals we had in all of Ireland. When leaving the hotel, check your bill when you leave, we were charged 3 times for items we did not use from the in-room fridge.  I would consider this hotel again if in Dublin as the location was terrific.
",4,2006,10,17
204,Excellent hotel!!,"Excellent hotel in a great location directly on St. Stephen's Green, a 2 minute walk to Grafton Street and a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar.  The rooms are lovely - we walked in to classical music playing softly in the room.  The turndown service includes chocolates on the bed, there are umbrellas in the room to protect from the inevitable rain in Dublin and the bathroom has a wonderful rain shower.  The staff were very helpful at all times; we ordered a snack at the bar and were told it was huge, so the staff were very accommodating and let us order a half order.  I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.
",5,2006,10,03
204,Lovely Stay at the Lovely Fitzwilliam,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights in September.  The staff were very friendly and helpful. Even though there was a taxi strike, when we wanted to go to the airport, they suggested all forms of transport and didnt emphasize their own car service, which would have been more expensive.  Room service was prompt and the food was very nice.  The food didnt seem to be more more expensive than other restaurants offering similar food.  The room was very clean with nice touches and the bathroom was lovely, with nice products and a big bath.  The room overlooking the garden was very quiet, perfect! It is on the expensive side but it is very nice indeed.  My one gripe is an environmental one, the shower uses way too much water!
",5,2006,09,12
204,"Good Location, Nice Staff, Some Glitches Though","Spent five nights here at the end of August and we had a very nice time, but there are a few problems we asked to be resolved which we felt just were swept under the carpet. 
Staff is very nice, food is good. Breakfast was good, but I guess being in Central Dublin and being U.S. Travellers, 23 Euro per person for a full Irish Breakfast striked us as a bit high, but Dublin is expensive. Our shower never drained properly and halfway through a shower the water would start to get to the top of the shower tub. (Maybe 4 inches high) We asked several times about resolving the problem and were told that it would be taken care of and it never was. We ended up giving up asking. When we got there the Internet in our room did not work. Again we asked for help and they told us we were third in line for help. I ended up crawling under the desk and power cycling the router that is underneath the desk. I would come back here again if I could get a guarentee that the shower would drain. This was the 7th stop on a tour of Ireland and we had great showers everywhere, it is a shame we did not have the ability to take a nice hot, semi-long shower. 
Other than the repair services, everyone was great, the location is great and room service was very fast.

204,First   Class,"We  stayed   at  this  hotel   for  a  weekend   break  and  it  was  superb  real  classy   hotel in  an  excellent  location,we  had  nothing  to complain  about  at  all. Would  highly  recommend this  hotel.
",5,2006,08,26
204,Great Classy Hotel,"My husband took me to Dublin for a birthday present, & we stayed at the Fitzwiliam the weekend of August 12th 2006.

I am wildly fussy, but absolutely loved the Fitzwilliam.  The staff were very attentive at all times, the room was fantastic, with understated classy contemporary styling, and the hotel was in the best location I could see in Dublin.

There were various small touches, which felt special: flowers, umbrellas available in the room, chocolates, the toiletries were of a good standard, and towels were replaced during the evenings when we were out at dinner after bathing.  The bath was large and comfortable, and designed for two.

The hotel was quiet, and we suffered from no intrusive noise at all from other rooms.  The hotel has a cd library which you can use whilst there.

We ate in the Michelin starred restaurant, and again found the food wonderful, and the staff attentive (although for 284 euro's for 2, I guess they should be....).  Slightly shocked by the language of the chef-proprietor, although maybe this is becoming fashionable amongst artistic chefs?

I loved this hotel, and would stay again without hesitation if I was to return to Dublin.
",5,2006,08,16
204,loved this hotel,"My fiancee stayed at this hotel for business for two weeks in Feb of 2005 and I came to visit him from the usa and I stayed for 5 nights

the hotel was wonderful - internet service -nice bed- the bath tub was out of this world - really big.  The hotel had excellent food and we very impressed.  The hotel was also really central - and it is very easy to navigate most of dublin without a car - 

this is probably one of my best hotel stays and I am well seasoned traveller

the concierge was also outstanding - they went out of their way to locate a restuarant that serves cottage pie - my fave - and they were very helpful to me - oh and the dublin visitor's centre is only two blocks away

I would definitely stay here again
",5,2006,08,13
204,great deal,"We stayed here the weekend of the GAA hurling semi's.  Hotel great and the rate was even better than the 2 & 3 star hotels.  Look out for the early bird menu in the resturant a very affordable meal for 3 for €75.  Top class will be going again!

Room was a spacious twin with a seperate shower and free standing bath. all usual facilities.  Only fault was shower tray filled up, but hey we have long hair!  They even gave us a brolly to go shopping when it rained, without a charge! which we brought back when the sun came out.  very nice hotel.
",4,2006,08,09
204,Fantastic experience,"My husband and I loved the Fitzwilliam. We're very fussy (!) and we found nothing to complain about here. It was extremely convenient, clean, and beautifully decorated, and the service was wonderful throughout our three-night stay. We highly recommend this hotel - we travel constantly for work, and found this to be one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. We got a great deal on lastminute.com, but we'd happily pay full price for such an outstanding hotel.
",5,2006,08,08
204,Nothing special,"I found this hotel to be ok but not exciting.  Room was quite nice and same with bathroom but nothing i haven't seen before.  

Location was good just minutes from Grafton Street.

Breakfast was very disappointing with very poor service and limited choice.

Next time, i think i would choose the Conrad
",3,2006,08,08
204,We keep going back to the Fitzwilliam,"My husband and I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam four years running.  We always book a balcony room overlooking St Stephens Green.  A nice way to start the day is room service breakfast on your balcony  overlooking St Stepehns Green.  Last year, June 2005, when we were in Dublin for the U2 concerts and a wedding anniversary, the hotel upgraded us to an even better room, sent chocolates and champagne to our room every night and the manager wrote us a handwritten congrats note.  Nice touch.  The concierge is always so helpfull and their advice for restaurants has always been on the mark.  We use them to make all our reservations including using their car service (Mercedes sedans) for airport pickup/return, concerts, etc.
",5,2006,07,11
204,Place to stay in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed in Dublin for two nights while on our honeymoon.  The Fitzwilliam was a bit pricy, but we liked the area and really ended up liking the hotel.  We had a pretty sizable room (Executive Queen Double) which consisted of a King size bed, several chairs, a window bench and a t.v.  It was a bit of a hike to the elevator (as a previous poster mentioned) but nothing outrageous.  The bathtub was huge and great to soak in.  The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful (walk you up to your room upon check-in, make dinner suggestions and reservations, etc).  

The location is right at the end of Grafton Street and it is easy to walk to Trinity College, etc. from the hotel.  In addition, many of the hop-on/hop-off bus tours have a stop right in front of the hotel.  Overall, it is the hotel that we will try again next time we are in Dublin!
",4,2006,06,27
204,a real find,"great location, directly across from St Stephen's Green, wonderful staff, even air conditioning!
",4,2006,06,25
204,A very modern hotel in a great location,"It is right next to the St. Stephens park and Grafton Street shops and is walkable to pretty much everything else. The hotel has a modern, cool vibe, with very luxe rooms, huge bathrooms (the tub was the biggest I have seen in a hotel) and little extras touches that were nice. The service was outstanding, the best we had in all of Ireland. Its sad that so few places still have staff that greet you nicely and make a point to help you during your stay.  We were very impressed by this hotel.
",5,2006,06,08
204,Long walk in dublin,"I stayed with my wife overnight in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin on 26th May.
We booked an executive room and paid 260 euro for bed and breakfast. The room was tiny and at the end of a very long corridor. If this was an executive room i would have hated to stay in a junior executive or normal room. I'm afraid no cats were swung in our room that night !
The hotel only has lifts at one corner of the building and as our room was at the total opposite side we had to walk 100yds from the lift every time we wanted to pop up to our room. It really was 100yds. I was so incensed that i paced it out !! I know , I am sad.
Th public areas of the hotel were very small also. A tiny cafeteria type bar area and above it in the same footprint a cafeteria type restaurant. When we arrived the consierge parked our car for us but on leaving were told that with regard to traffic it would be better for us to drive out ourselves from the hotel car park. So we were left to wander around the car park to find our car , then to find our own way and drive out. Hardly 5 star service.
On the positive side the hotel has a great location and very friendly staff but was poor value for money even in the rack renting Dublin of 2006
",3,2006,05,30
204,Great Hotel,"Just came back from the Fitzwilliam,  The staff were excellent, couldn't do enough. When we left something in the room safe after checking out, the staff could not be more helpful.  and retrieved the item concerned preventing a family crises. The room was very nice overlooking an attractive courtyard between the hotel and the next building.   We ate in the restaurant which was delightful.   however there was aniother restaurant which looked extremely expensive. - be warned.  The bar stated that the kitchen was open all day  7 days a week but when we wanted somethung to eat at 4pm on a Sunday, we were told that the kitchen was  closed.  They should be more consistent.  Even so, I would be happy to return upon my next trip to Dublin.
",4,2006,05,22
204,"Expensive, but great location","Rooms were very nice, lovely courtyard, stereos in the rooms, and probably the best location in Dublin.
I went on business and it was perfect.  If you can afford it, I would recommend that you stay here
",5,2006,04,30
204,St Patricks Treat,"Just come back from spending two nights at the Fitzwilliam. The place deserves the previous positive reviews.  Bedrooms are spacious and clean. The bathroom is spotless with a powerful shower, bathrobes and a generous selection of quailty freebies.  

Service is very friendly and unobtrusive, and as a bonus they have some of the most attractive girls in Ireland on the reception desk!
",5,2006,03,19
204,"Clean, quiet, comfortable","We just returned from a four-night stay at the Fitzwilliam.  We chose this hotel after reading reviews on this website regarding the location, amenities and price (we paid a little less than $200 per night, admittedly during the low season.)  Our goal was to stay in the heart of Dublin but not over some loud night club or bar. Simply stated, we were not disappointed with the Fitzwilliam.  

While not 5-star quality, the room was large (even for U.S. standards), clean and well appointed.  There was an ample supply of top quality towels, robes, pillows, toiletries, etc.  The King sized bed was comfortable and the integrated sound system was a nice touch.  

Enough cannot be said about the great shower and water pressure.  In fact, it was one of the best parts of the stay at this hotel.  Instant hot water and a huge waterfall shower head: very pleasant.

The staff were friendly and eager to please.  No problems with the bill or checking in or out.  Simply no ""horror stories"" to report, contrary to other postings.

Now to the best part -- the location.  The hotel is far enough away from the noise to allow for some much needed rest, yet close enough to be a 2 minute walk to great shopping and nightlife.  We greatly enjoyed the neighboring restaurants and pubs, especially Kehoes.      

In all, we had a memorable holiday in Dublin and at the Fitzwilliam.  We would not hesitate to stay here again and highly recommend this hotel.
",4,2006,01,22
204,"Good hotel, but service needs some work","My husband and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for our honeymoon. We were pleased with the location and had booked a decent deal online. We stayed for nine days. 

When we first arrived, the concierge welcomed us and showed us to the check in counter. We were one hour earlier than the check in time, but had been on a plane for 11 hours. They made us sit in the lobby with our luggage for an hour till they could check us in. For the rest of the day whenever we entered or exited the building, they always greeted us by name. This friendliness stopped the second day.

We spent a lot of time out and about. They were unhelpful when we were trying to find a concert to go to, and when we showed them tickets we had to a concert just outside the city, they directed us to check out the bus station... without really telling us where that was. When we arrived back from the concert, it was very late so we tried to order some food in since everything in the hotel was closed. We were told if we ordered a pizza or whatnot, it would be refused at the door. So we went to bed hungry.

There was a lot of drilling as they were refurbishing a whole floor, so we had to complain a few times. But the room was great, the washroom was nice, and the waterpressure was amazing! 

They unfortunately do not offer anything special for newlyweds, not even a bottle of champagne or wine. We were a bit disappointed with the hotel, but we enjoyed the central location a lot. I would probably look elsewhere next time.
",3,2006,01,20
204,Perfect Fitzwilliam,"My husband and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 4 nights to celebrate his birthday.We were given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room with terrace/balcony and room service delivered a box of luxury chocolates to our room to say ""Happy Birthday"",which we thought was a nice touch.The room was spacious and very clean and the bathroom was very nice,it had a wonderful bathtub and very powerful shower,although there was also a separate shower attatchment on the taps if you couldn't stand the pressure of the shower!!Apart from a temperamental bathroom light switch and a small scorch mark on the dressing table the room was excellent.The bar and lounge areas are excellent as was the service.We ate in Citron restaurant one evening and we can honestly say it was the best fillet steak we have ever had,it was well presented and a very reasonable price.The hotel is ideally placed next to the main shopping area and accessible to the local attractions,we would definately recommend this hotel and we hope to return again ourselves.
",5,2006,01,20
204,Disaster!,"Well we didn't actually stay in this hotel because despite booking it through they're own web site a whole month before and receiving a confirmation email...oh I forgot to mention the deposit.....when we arrived we were told they had no booking for us and that we must have booked it through an agency!!!
We were told the whole hotel had been booked by a party of 350 people so I suppose 2 of us who'd booked this weekend break especially for the James Blunt concert at the Point didn't matter at all. It completely ruined the concert for both of us. Yes, they offered us another hotel but as we had less than an hour to get there and get ready and to the concert that just was not good enough!
",1,2006,01,13
204,Great service - Slightly over priced,"I booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a Christmas break in Dublin. The location is fantastic - just at the top (or bottom, more correctly) of Grafton Street.

Looking forward to 5 star luxury, it pains me to say I was slightly disappointed. I tried very hard to be pleased with the stay, but I struggled. The great service from the staff does deserve the 5 star rating, but there were a few issues which I found displeasing.

Our room was small. Booked through Lastminute, I never realised we wouldn't be allocated a balcony room. No problem, but we ended up with what I would class as a very small room. It was comfortable, well decorated and air conditioned, but small. I thought luxury would involve space.

The Malmaison in Edinburgh set a level for 4 star hotels in our books. That was a gorgeous room, matched with great service. The Fitzwilliam came across a bit rough round the edges, but if you do book the hotel - you won't be disappointed with the service. Plus, the reception and bar are lovely areas to relax in.",4,2005,12,20
204,Loved The Fitzwilliam,"My husband and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam for one night and I have to say it was a fantastic experience. The staff were incredibly helpful, nothing was too much trouble; the rooms were contemporary; the bath was huge and it filled in no time thanks to the great water pressure. We also had a meal at Citron which was very reasonably priced and the service was great. Huge selection for breakfast which is also served in the Citron restaurant. Great location too. And tasteful Christmas decorations!
",5,2005,12,15
204,enjoyed the fitzwilliam,"My friends and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night and despite some hiccups we would return.
The rooms, although not large are well equipped and more than adequate.The hotel was spotless throughout and furnishings and carpets etc were of a high quality.
On our last day we had lunch in the Citron restaurant which was reasonably priced at 20 euros for 2 course plus coffee and the food was of an extremely high standard.
The hotel is situated on St Stephen's Green just around the corner from Grafton Street thus making the amenities of central Dublin easily accessable on foot.
We raised some concerns regarding some rennovations that were in place on our floor and the breakfast is certainly not the best that we have had in Dublin. However, our concerns were given full consideration and addressed appropriately, as in keeping with a hotel of this standard
On the whole we found the staff to be accommodating and helpful and given the positive response to the concerns we rasied we would have absolutely no hesitation in returning to or recommending the hotel.
",4,2005,11,12
204,Absolutely Fabulous!,"My husband and I just stayed at the Fitzwilliam two weekends ago and had a great time.  We were on our two week vacation and only stayed in Dublin for two days - but it was a great stay.  Our room was very quiet and it overlooked the back of the hotels garden - it was very nice at night.  And the water pressure!  Coming from the States and having been staying with my family and the electric showers - it was so nice to have a good hot shower with awesome water pressure!!!  
We also had dinner in Citron - and we were very nicely surprised that our dinner was included in our room price!  The 70 Euro dinner wasn't on our bill - only the tip.  Breakfast was included as well, but we never made it down there in time - we slept in both mornings.  
I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin - it's pricey, but it's worth it.",5,2005,10,10
204,PERFECT location w/great breakfast,"Stayed here for 1 night after the U2 concert in June.  This is the perfect location for walking around all of central Dublin.  It's at the end of Grafton St and directly across from St. Stephen's Green.  Temple Bar is a few blocks away.  The hotel is modern and sleek, but not what I'd consider 5-star.  The room was large and modern, though I noticed stains on the carpet.  The bath was extraordinary in design and filled w/Molton Brown toiletries, however the shower's pressure was so strong that it could have left your head competely bald.  Way too strong!!!!  Our room was around 315 Euros and included a FABULOUS and delicious buffet breakfast.  A bit pricy for the room and common areas, but the location and breakfast more than made up for the rest.

204,Great location,"Wonderful hotel for a celebration.  Great location with views over St Stephen's Green.  less than 1 minute to Grafton Street for great shopping.  Walking distance of many great restaurants and bars for lunch and dinner.  Our room was adequate size, but with lovely balcony overlooking the green.  Great for early morning coffee watching the world go by or a late afternoon drink in the warm dublin air.  Would definitely stay there again, although rather expensive for room only.  2 restaurants, one of which is 2 michelin stars.
",5,2005,09,22
204,Nice hotel,"Stayed here overnight on 30 June 2005.  Room was fine - large for European standards.  Decor was very pleasant - everything had a large ""F"" on it. Towels very nice and a comfy robe provided as well.  I had no problems with noise - I overlooked the rear courtyard at ground level.  Reception is a bit confusing for first timers - they are tucked around the corner, and I am sure the concierge must get tired of redirecting people.  Drinks in the bar were typically priced for this sort of place.  Location was great for walking around.
Only problem was getting a taxi on the morning I left - finally convinced concierge to order one for me, and he told me to wait ""somewhere over there"", gesturing at the lobby.  I watched a number of people come downstairs, and get into taxis as they pulled up, whilst I was still being ignored.  Complained to the concierge, only to have him remove some people from a taxi that had just arrived and put me in it instead - very embarrassing all up.  I suggest going round the corner where I believe there is a taxi rank!!
",4,2005,08,23
204,"Good hotel, even better restaurant","Great hotel in a great location just south of Grafton St and opposite St Stephen's Green (the hub of life during the day and at weekends) with great restaurants nearby. The hotel was great value and has Thornton's a Michelin 2* at a not unreasonable price. It also has the Citron restaurant which was offering a 2 for 1 deal.
Overall my wife and I had a great time with pleasant helpful staff, great location away from the noise of Temple Bar and we felt safe to walk around at night.
WOuld definitely stay there again.
",5,2005,08,21
204,Great location,"If you want either a sight seeing, partying or business stay then you'll be hard pushed to beat this place for the price. Stay for business and its ideal. They have free internet access, free parking and friendly staff, especially important when staying on your own and needing to see a friendly face. The rooms are great, with satellite Tv, CD player and complimentary chocolates at bedtime. I found the bar area to be informal and friendly but it definitely seems more focussed towards after work drinkers than later partying types. I'll definitely be coming back and using it as a base to explore more of the city, as its location by St Stephens Green and Grafton street is brilliant.
",5,2005,07,20
204,How do I love the Fitzwilliam?  Let me count the ways...,"I wasn't supposed to stay at the Fitzwilliam, but thanks to a travel agent error, I stayed at this fantastic hotel for one lovely night.  I will be back.

I arrived at the Fitzwilliam frazzled over the travel agent error that sent me to another hotel first, exhausted and sore from a wild previous evening at a U2 show, and dispirited at having to transfer hotels whilst feeling so rough.  When I went into the Fitzwilliam's lobby and was treated so professionally and warmly by the receptionist, I started to relax.  My room wasn't ready, but the receptionist took my mobile number and said she would ring me when I could move on in.  I did some shopping on Grafton Street (which is literally around the corner from the hotel), and very soon, I got the call to come back.

Oh my, was the room posh!  I've stayed in some nice places before, but my room at the Fitzwilliam ranks among the top five rooms I've had.  It was small (the queen-sized bed filled most of it), but the bathroom was very large, absolutely immaculate in cleanliness, and had a marvelous bathtub, there was a balcony with a wonderful view of St. Stephen's Green, and the telly offered internet access (and free broadband had I a laptop).  The bath towels were soft and big, and there were also bathrobes for guests to use.  The bed was firm but not overly so.  I slept incredibly well that night.

The staff was excellent.  I had difficulty accessing the telly-based internet, and within 10 minutes, a manager was in my room, fixing the problem so I could go online.  Later, I blew a fuse in my room, shutting off all the lights, and the management had my electricity fixed very quickly.  The bellmen were very efficient and went the extra miles to help with luggage.

There is a turndown service at night.  I came home to truffles on my pillow, which were a pleasant surprise.  

In all, I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam to travellers heading to Dublin.  I will definitely keep this hotel on my list of good places to stay.  The experience was wonderful, and I feel lucky that my travel agent's error ended up as it did.

204,Dreadful!  Do not stay here!,"If you are looking for good service and a good night's sleep - stay somewhere else!  Evertime the people in the rooms nearby used the bathroom, the pipes started shaking and making a deafening noise.  we complained to the night manager who kept us waiting in reception for 3 hours before he said nothing could be done.  We raised the problem with the day manager who was rude and dismissive.   Asked to speak to the manager but they said he didn't like to be disturbed on his weekends.  So, as long as John Kavanagh the manager is comfortable and has a quiet weekend, he doesn't care about the guests!  

At £230/400 Euros a night - take your business elsewhere.",1,2005,06,27
204,going down,"we first stayed at the fitzwilliam two years ago.It was fresh and modern and fun.

It is now begining to show a little age- and the prices are rising!

the rooms were always small for a luxury hotel ; now maybe  we have got bigger but they seem really  tiny. beautifully fitted maybe, but it would be nice to have at least one  comfy chair to sit on and to be able to pass each other somewhere in the room!

And the food in the Citron restaurant. It used to be quite pleasant. But now they must have changed their microwave food supplier. Dinner was heavy and lifeless.No wonder they have to have a two for one offer -and even then the punters dont come.

But maybe it does not all matter too much. the fitzwilliam is situated actually on st stephens green, one of the most beautiful parts of a beautiful city-and within walking distance are not only most of the major sites but great shopping and at least 50 alternative restaurants.

204,a good position to start discovering dublin,"the position of this hotel is perfect to visit Dublin, just near St Stephen's Green and the pedastrian area.. the rooms were also spacious and full of light. The service was sometimes ingenuos and not competely satisfactory but they tried to give us their best.. If you have money to spend, this is a good place where to stay in Dublin!
",3,2005,06,22
204,Great Hotel. Great location,"Room and bathroom - excellent standard of cleanliness.
Linen and towels excellent.
Comfortable bed in a very relaxing atmosphere.
Room furnished to a high standard.
Would definitely stay there again and have recommended it to friends.

204,Loved it!,"We stayed overnight here just before Easter, miserable weather and both of us feeling ill and sorry for ourselves, so it was really important to be staying in a good hotel - The Fitzwilliam didn't disappoint. Perfect location. The staff were all genuinely friendly with a desire to be helpful and informative. The lobby area is light and welcoming, and the rooms themselves are furnished to a high standard. I loved luxuriating in my huge bath with my choice of music on the cd player coming out of the bathroom speakers! Shower was invigorating and powerful and lovely fluffy bathrobes to climb into afterwards.

Bed - firm but really comfortable.

Just a couple of gripes - the drilling and hammering from the adjacent room - we assume that much needed air conditioning is gradually being installed.

The food in Citron did disppoint, particularly a rather sad dried up Irish breakfast, which was certainly not worth the 40 euros each they mistakenly tried to charge us for despite being on an inclusive rate.

Despite those disappointments, we really enjoyed our stay.",4,2005,04,01
204,Great - loved it!,"Just come back from Easter Weekend break in Dublin, staying at The Fitzwilliam Hotel. 
Hotel is in great position - just on St Stephens Green right in the centre of town, and only a few minutes walk from the great shops on Grafton Street.
We arrived on Good Friday (be aware this is a ""dry day"" in Dublin and no pubs are open), and after a short taxi ride from the airport arrived at the hotel. Lovely, airy, modern lobby with friendly reception staff, who checked us in and explained what was going on in Dublin over the Easter weekend. She also booked us a table in the hotel's Citron restaurant for that evening.
The room itself was just as we had expected from the hotel website - modern, very clean with a brilliant bathroom - nice big bath, dimmer switch lighting, a speaker for the CD player in the room and of course nice big fluffy bathrobes. (I do like a nice bathroom!). We had a ground floor room overlooking the garden in the centre of the hotel. This was nice as there was a window seat overlooking the garden in the room, and in the evening there were pretty fairy lights in the trees! I think most of the rooms either overlook this garden or St Stephens Green opposite the hotel.

We had dinner that evening in the Citron restaurant in the hotel - really great food with good service. The Inn on the Green is also great for cocktails or the 130 euro a shot Brandy if you fancy that?!

While we were in Dublin we did the usual tourist things - Guiness brewery, Jamesons tour etc. Both were really good and well worth a visit, but if you go at a busy time, then be prepared to queue. 
We also visited the Kilmainham Gaol - this is one of the largest unused Gaols in Europe. There is a musuem and you get a guided tour of the old and newer parts of the gaol also. A really, really interesting place which I would recommend taking an hour or two to visit (it is only 5 euro entrance fee).
You can use the toursist buses which are a good way to get round the city and stop outside all the major places to visit. But to be honest if you have a good map / guidebook then it is a small enough city to walk around and there are lots of pubs to stop off at for emergency refuelling Guiness stops.
",5,2005,03,28
204,"Great Location, good rooms","The location of this place can't be beat, within walking distance to everything. The rooms are somewhat small but have great bathrooms especially by Euro standards. They have just done some remodeling and have included rainfall showers in the tubs (finally, a hotel with a good shower in Europe...).  The rooms include everything you would need but I wouldn't call them luxurious.  The beds could stand to be more comfortable.  This hotel has a modern, stylish edge to it and the bar, albeit very expensive, serves great drinks.  I recommend the breakfast, the food is very good.  This is a great deal if you book through Expedia.
",4,2005,03,27
204,Great Location & Great Hotel,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam on a couple of occasions in 2003 and 2004 and have had a very pleasant stay both times.  The hotel is in a great location overlooking St Stephen's Green and 50yrds from Grafton Street.  The staff are helpful and professional and cater for all your needs.  I have friends that are Dubliners and they also love this hotel!  Well recommended!!
",5,2005,01,26
204,Fantastic,"The hotel is lovely, it was a surprise to get chocolates on my bed. It is in a great location.  The staff are friendly.  I would recommend staying there.
",5,2005,01,22
204,Wow!  What a great place to stay!,"We only stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights, but we had a terrific stay!  The concierge staff was spectacular, even knew us by name (which was amazing since we only stayed 2 nights, as I had mentioned before).  The breakfast was great as well.  Over all, it is a wonderful hotel and would recommend it to everyone!
",5,2004,11,30
204,lovely and luxurious,"After spending an appalling night at The River House Hotel (see review).Booked into the Fitzwilliam,very helpful and friendly staff.The room was lovely huge bed, bathrobes provided wonderful bathroom and toiletries, they even provided an umbrella for your stay.
Very quiet location but right next to the shops, park etc..
Will definitely return.
",5,2004,10,19
204,Strange Smells,"We have just spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam, which generally was pretty good, but not worth the £360. The Hotel is very well presented and very well located, but on our trip we had three problems :

1. There was a strange smokey /  burning smell around the room which left a dry feeling in your throat. We brought it up with reception but they did not solve the problem.

2. There are building works going on, possibly the source of the smell. The workmen are normally busy before 9am.

3. The rooms are very small for a 5 star hotel.

My advice - try somewhere else!",2,2004,10,12
204,Where am I?,"The Morrison or this gaff??? Well there are pro's and con's to both. Although on St Stephens Green it next door to a hiddeous mini shopping mall complete with Mc D's. Once again you,ll be mad to pay rack so search out a deal and forget the over expensive breakfast. Good bathrooms dark hallways ...its all a bit 1998 and trying too hard, and sits a little bit at un-ease with the most 1986 image of Dublin ( with 2020 prices  ) hello..  Am I in Paris?....no there are no decent cafes or shops... more like Preston
",3,2004,09,23
204,Was a little disappointing,"I had higher hopes from this hotel.  The room was ""trying too hard"" to be cool and hip while it was not functional (no power outlets, and there were around 40 light switches that never quite produced the appropriate light); the bed was uncomfortable and much of the space was taken up by a huge closet in the center of the room which made it feel cramped.  The construction is still going on and begins early, and my room always smelled like whatever they were sawing on the electric saw.  The bathroom was great - beautiful tiles and a great bath tub.  The lobby was also great - very inviting and warm - which also describes the staff.  The location is wonderful - right by Stephen's Green, and it's a safe neighborhood after dark.   I would probably look elsewhere next time, unless a great deal came along.
",3,2004,09,08
204,Must be the best in Dublin,"Brilliant hotel.  Ideally situated - no noise but convenient for all of Dublin's sights.
Room was excellent and the staff very helpful.
Would recommend it to anyone.
",5,2004,09,02
204,Not quite the Ritz,"My friend and I just spent two nights at the Fitzwilliam over the August long weekend.  Immediately we were pleasantly surprised by the location particularly the proximity to Grafton street shopping and the pleasant parklands across the road.  The lobby to the hotel was chic, warm and inviting with an open lit fire place amongst comfy looking couches.  Once we got to our room what immediately hit us was it lacked a wow factor.  The rooms were very nice and comfortable but it just seemed to lack something with its limited roomspace and neutral decor.  The bathroom was probably the best bit with a great bath which filled quickly accompanied by molton brown toiletries.  The CD player was a nice welcome touch.  We noticed that the housekeeping took a long time to be done and for someone who likes to shower regularly there are not a lot of replacement towels (which could have been thicker).  The bed was average and lacked the equisiteness of certain hotels which market themselves on deluxe bedding which after all is what one wants most from a hotel room.
",3,2004,08,31
204,Great Location,"Location excellent, opt for air conditioned room, we nearly melted without it.  Citron restaurant excellent, staff very friendly.  Excellent location for shopping
",4,2004,08,05
204,Contemporary chic in Dublin,"Have just returned from a three night stay at the Fitzwilliam. The hotel is chic and contemporary with excellent service. We stayed in a room overlooking the ongoing construction, but even with the window open noise was not an issue. 
Having stayed in most of the other 4 and 5 star hotels in Dublin the Fitzwilliam is the best. We will definitely return there again.
",5,2004,07,05
204,Excellent hotel. The restaurant is surprisingly cheap and good!,"I got this hotel on Priceline for $160 per night.  It was well worth the price.  Fluffy bathrobes, complimentary chocolates, CD players with bathroom speakers, all in a prime location.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I was most impressed with Citron, the restaraunt in the hotel.  They offer amazing deals (two meals for 20 Euro) on fantastic cuisine.  The bar also serves some of the best and cheapest food in otherwise overpriced Dublin. 
",5,2004,06,26
204,Hotel construction appears to be finished.,"Just returned from Dublin and stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 5 nights starting on June 12, 2004--we were put in one of the new rooms at the back of the hotel--we were told that the new rooms were about one month old--the rooms, location, and staff were well above average.  We paid about $195 (U.S.) per night--bought thru Expedia.  There is some new construction going on toward the left side of the hotel, but, our room on the back side was very quiet.  You cannot beat this location-it is about 200 feet to the beginning of Grafton street.
",5,2004,06,22
204,Putting on the Fitzwilliam,"Excellent Hotel especially location, service and decor. Elegantly chic and contemporary rooms. Nice space.Very thoughtful. Construction is a problem though, and I was not made aware of this prior to my arrival. Some rooms look directly onto a Construction site and Vice Versa...Avoid these rooms....Work began early on SUNDAY 30MAY which was disturbing. Service was excellent and staff did all possible to faciltate any problems I had.... This hotel enhanced my stay in Dublin and suits the overall sense of style in the heart of Dublin.
",4,2004,05,30
204,"Nice hotel ,when finished.","We stayed at the hotel on a friday night in march 04 ,and although we were pleasantly surprised when we entered our room ,the sound of building work from a major extension was a little worrying .Unfortunately noise could be heard throughout the day and even worse ,we were awakened at 8 am on the saturday morning .This was a shame as the hotel was lovely in all ther respects.
",3,2004,03,14
204,Excellent staff & position,"Excellent. Had a long weekend there and the room was very nice and the staff polite and genuine at all times. Did get a good last minute price and possibly would not pay the full normal rates. However, the hotel was very good and the location is ideal. If you get a good enough rate I highly recommend it.",4,2004,01,20
204,Great location,Spent one night here. One of the best locations however it is a little over priced. Excellent restaurant but one of Dublin's most expensive. Free carpark. Decor is modern minimalistic - not sure I like it. There are better hotels in Dublin for the money.,3,2003,12,26
204,"Courtesy, style, and comfort","Spent two nights here in December of 2002, after the hotel we'd actually made reservations at had accidentally overbooked and put us up in the Fitzwilliam as recompensation. There is much about the hotel that is impressive, but what impressed me most is that two college students who had been bumped out of a 75 euro a night Best Western were treated no differently than the other guests. The Fitzwilliam staff was helpful, efficient, and friendly as well. The hotel itself is what a modern luxury hotel should be -- no faded flowered bedspreads or beige walls. Fluffy white down bedspread, high quality linens, lovely dark wood furniture -- very sleek, very modern. The shower is not unlike standing under a waterfall, (in the best possible way.) Having stayed at 2 other 4 and 5 star hotels in Dublin, I'm really surprised that this one isn't rated higher in the rankings at Trip Advisor. (It's currently #26.)",5,2003,12,07
204,Internet Ripoff,"Good location, markets itself as hip business hotel but complete ripoff on Internet. 1+ Euro per minute. No excuse. for this type of scam",1,2003,11,27
204,meaningful trip in october,"I stayed here in October. First trip home in a few years. Really, a great hotel with a few problems to iron-out. My trans-atlantic flight came in pretty early in the morning and I was unable to relax and sleep ANYWHERE. I was very upset that there wasn't even a quiet 'Louge- area' to go for a few hours before I could check-in. To add insult to injury, the first available room was (as you've probably guessed) pretty much on top of the building site. This was VERY noisy. Apart from that, the staff where great .......what else can I say, tastefully decorated. 
Just hate construction when making a memorable stay at a hotel.",2,2003,11,08
204,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed here two nights in October 2003. The staff was very helpful. 
The rooms were tastefully decorated and very clean. The hotel had a feeling of class and elegance. Best of all it was in an ideal location for touring the city. I would definitely stay at the Fiitzwilliam again.

P.S. The Shower was the best shower pressure I have ever experienced in my life. That alone made the visit! For those of you who watch: It was like the Seinfeld episode with the black market shower head used only on elephants!",5,2003,11,03
204,The Firzwilliam for Comfort,"The Fitzwillliam is extraordinarily comfortable. Our superior grade room was elegant, of good size and quiet despite the work on the hotel's addition and Dublin's new transit system just opposite. The room on the third floor has a view of St. Stephen's Green. During our five-night stay, the staff efficiently took care of our needs, including arranging tours and other events. Our only concern was the restaurants, which seemed over priced, but this was a small matter because so many fine establishments are within a few blocks.",5,2003,11,01
204,Tough to maintain class amidst construction,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two days. There was construction EVERYWHERE! We could hardly see the hotel for the construction next door and the lovely park across the street was completely obscured by barriers due to some sort of repair or construction.

I think the staff was bravely trying to carry on despite all these problems, but it was hard for them. To make our stay worse, a concierge directed us to the wrong events and the hotel bar was not air conditioned so it was swealtering in the uncharacteristically warm September weather.

Generally, I think the hotel is a bit pompous. A doorman wearing formal coats with tails is a bit much.

Perhaps things will improve when the construction is finished, but I will never stay there again.",2,2003,10,09
204,"Location, style, quality","I stayed in the Fitzwilliam with my girlfriend over Valentines, paying euro 110 for the room on an internet offer via the hotel website. As soon as we arrived in the lobby I realised I was going to be in the good books fo the rest of the trip, as the sense of style and understated luxury was clear. This is a Terence Conran designed hotel, and the modern, minimalistic yet comfortable furnishings and decorations are fantastic. The rooms are very comfortable, though some do look onto construction work behind the hotel (is to be expected sometimes in a big city). This didn't detract at all from a fantastic stay. Thge bathrooms too are lovely, with large bath tubs and elegant detail. The main restaurant (Peacock Alley) is mega-expensive and probably one of Dublin's most expensive restaurants, but the bistro (Citron) is cheaper but excellent value with quality service and even better food. In short, well worth the stay at one of Dublin's classiest hotels.",5,2003,08,11
204,Ripped Off,"I chose the Fitzwilliam for my 2-night trip to Dublin because the reviews on this site were so complementary! I had booked a ""Superior Double overlooking the Largest Roofgarden in Europe"" and was assigned an Executive room, level with the roofgarden. My view of the roofgarden was a patch of grass, plusa huge screen with a crane behind it. The roofgarden was being dug up and there was plenty of noise to prove it! 
I suggested that I had been assigned the incorrect room and was told to take it up with the internet travel company I booked with. As if this wasn't enough - the electricity in our room was off for 3 hours during the second afternoon.Very bad experience",1,2003,07,22
204,Pleasant but pricey,The fitzwilliam is right in the centre of the shopping and restaurant district in Dublin and opposite the great St Stephens Green park . When it stops raining all the locals suddenly come out here to play.The hotel has style and staff are pleasant and helpful. We stayed in a cheaper room which was on the small side for a luxury establishment although the bathroom was good.The Hotels Citron restaurant was good and reasonable but beware the fabled Thorntons which is also in the hotel.It maybe the best in Ireland but i guess the prices must be amongst the highest in Europe.A great place to stay if you can get a good deal.,4,2003,07,15
204,Great Style and Location,"Decided to book a surprise valentine's weekend for my wife at the Fitzwilliam in Feb03 and I have to say that the hotel lived up to all expectations. The location was great being close to some of the best shops and restaurants in Dublin. The sytle of the hotel was superb - whilst it was very contemporary it still exudes sophistication and class without being pretentious. As it was Velentine's, I tried to book into a number of restaurants to no avail. In the end, I reluctantly booked in to the Citron restaurant within the hotel. I say reluctanctly as at the time I thought the price was pretty high. In hindsight, it was worth spending the extra as the meal was excellent.All in all this is a great hotel in a great location and if you find a good deal (try Expedia) then you're sure to be pleased with your choice.",5,2003,03,24
204,"Perfect Location, Worth a splurge!","This is a sleek and sexy Hotel in the perfect area of Dublin.  Across the street is one of the most beautiful city center parks in Europe- Stephens Green.  To the left as you leave the Hotel is Grafton Street, the fantatstic pedestrian only shopping district.  The Rooms are spacious and have many special amenities.  The Hotel Retaurant, Peacock Alley, is one of the best in Europe and a must.  Do yourself the favor and splurge on this Hotel.  Do not let the Modern look turn you off.  Spend hours relaxing in the rooftop garden.

Der Teppich in den Gängen müffelt etwas. Der Frühstücksraum ist für die Größe des Hotels etwas klein, das Frühstück selbst aber hervorragend. Es gibt ein kleines Buffet und eine Auswahl an warmen Gerichten. Der Service ist exzellent. ",4,2018,08,05
204,GB,"Consiglierei l'hotel per la location, la professionalità dello staff e l'ottima colazione. Unico punto migliorabile trovare dei dissuasori per spostare ovunque i gabbiani che non permettono di dormire tranquillamente o diventano fastidiosi in diverse ore del giorno.",5,2018,07,23

204,No está mal,"El hotel no está mal, pero no es un cinco estrellas, que se conforme con cuatro, principalmente porque el hall tiene poco empaque  y las habitaciones  necesitan alguna actualización. 
Esta muy bien situado,  eso sí, y el personal muy amable, mención especial para Lisa, la italiana de recepción, encantadora y muy servicial. Gracias!
El desayuno, bueno, sobre todo porque tiene una carta de la que se puede pedir cualquier cosa para complementar la oferta del buffet.
En conjunto podemos decir que bien.",4,2018,01,03

204,"Excelente hotel, muy bien situado","Excelente hotel. Impecable, limpieza excelente, con servicio muy atento. Habitaciones muy cómodas, si bien no especialmente grandes para un 5 estrellas. Desayuno muy bien, pero la sala es mejorable, ya que parte de ella da la entrada del hotel, con lo cual en alguna mesa entra frío de la calle y hay corrientes de aire. Una mampara de cristal que lo aislara un poco mas vendría muy bien. Otra pega es que la bañera está situada muy alta lo cual puede resultar incómodo para entrar o salir a personas mayores o no muy ágiles. Situación excelente al lado de la zona peatonal de shopping.

La primera noche hubo un problema con el desagüe del baño y tuvimos que esperar hasta el día siguiente para que fuera reparado (algo que demoró menos de un minuto y que cualquiera habría podido arreglar en su propia casa). 
El otro problema es que las puertas son pesadas y suenan mucho al cerrarse, lo que puede complicarte si deseas dormir más allá de las 7 am.

La posizione è invidiabile, a due passi da Grafton street e 10 minuti a piedi da Temple bar. La colazione è molto buona e abbondante. Ho cenato al Citron, che però purtroppo non é all'altezza di tutto il resto: menu ridotto, pochissime portate, elaborate, difficile scegliere perché non ritrovavano molto i miei gusti. Il personale resta attento e carino, consiglio di migliorare la scelta delle portate o perlomeno aumentarle ( si parla di tre antipasti e tre piatti principali in tutto). ",4,2016,10,23

A disposizione degli ospiti tre opzioni dove poter mangiare, il bar (in on the green) che propone piatti veloci, il Citron, ristorantino nella sala adibita alle colazioni, oppure il ristorante vero e proprio il Thornton's.

Das Zimmer war sauber, obwohl es schon ein bisschen in die Jahre gekommen ist. Einige Schubladen und Türen klemmten, das Badezimmer ein bisschen klein, aber funktional. Die Zimmer sind hellhörig (Wasserrohre) und leider hat es in den Zimmern Teppich! (Bin kein Fan)

Il riscaldamento era regolato al massimo e si moriva dal caldo, le chiavi si smagnetizzavano spesso non permettendo l'accesso veloce alle stanze. Il personale era molto gentile e disponibile, tuttavia alla fine del soggiorno ci hanno messo in conto una cena che non abbiamo consumato!

204,"Gute Lage, Zimmer teuer und teilweise laut","Die Lage des Hotels ist hervorragend, zentraler geht´s nicht. Die Innenstadt sowie die Kneipen- und Restaurantszene sind locker fußläufig zu erreichen. Das Personal - Concierge, Reception - war gut drauf, kannte sein Handwerk. Bei der Ankunft wurde das Gepäck sofort aus dem Auto gehievt und der Wagen in die Garage gefahren. Der Concierge erläuterte den nachgefragten Stadtplan ausführlich.
Leider war das Zimmer unbefriedigend.Erstens war es klein. Zweitens ging es nach vorn raus, Richtung Park, wenn man es positiv formuliert. Davon hatten wir jedoch nichts, weil zwischen dem Hotel und dem Park eine Straßenbahn-Endstation liegt. Da wird viel geklingelt, und die Menschen machen jede Menge Lärm. Insbesondere am Wochenende, wenn Bier und Whiskey strömen. Die benachbarte Kneipe produzierte viele enthemmt grölende Besucher. Mit anderen Worten: Zimmer nach vorne unbedingt meiden, wenn man schlafen möchte. Die Zimmer nach hinten dürften ruhig sein, sind aber noch teurer. Das Hotel sollte bezüglich der Zimmergüte genauer und ehrlicher informieren. Bei dem von uns bewohnten Zimmer stimmte das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis nicht. (Im übrigen kann ich die an anderer Stelle gerügte schlechte Teppichverlegung bestätigen).",3,2014,07,21
204,Ubicación perfecta. Trato excelente.,"Hemos pasado un muy agradable fin de semana en este hotel.Lo hemos elegido por casualidad, porque el que queríamos de primera opción no tenía habitaciones libres. Este cambio fue una suerte, porque hemos descubierto un sitio magnífico.

UBICACIÓN.
Está situado al final de Grafton Street, justo al comienzo de St. Stephen´s Green. Una estupenda ubicación para ir a cualquier parte del centro de Dublín.
 
CHECK-IN
Muy rápido. Tenían la documentación preparada. En poco tiempo ya nos habían explicado el funcionamiento y los servicios del hotel y subimos a la habitación. 

HABITACIÓN
Nos dieron una de la quinta planta. Era muy cómoda en cuanto al espacio y la distribución. La cama era amplia, y con un buen colchón, por lo que el descanso fue bueno. Toda la pared exterior era un gran ventanal luminoso, donde había dos sitios para sentarse con cojines. Las vistas eran a la parte trasera del hotel, a un patio con un jardín muy bonito.

BAÑO
Era grande y cómodo. Tenía una bañera grande, con una muy buena presión del agua. Las amenities, muy completas, tenían aromas muy agradables. 

DESAYUNO
Tipo buffet, no con una variedad excesiva pero sí de buena calidad. Un poco de todo: dulce, salado, fruta… Podías pedir platos calientes a base de huevos que te los hacían al momento,. En todo momento estabas atendido por varios camareros que estaban pendientes por si necesitabas algo. 

WIFI 
Incluido en la tarifa de la habitación. Iba bastante rápido y sin cortes. 

LIMPIEZA
Impecable en todo el hotel, tanto habitaciones como zonas comunes. 

STAFF
Todo el personal del hotel se esfuerza por darte un trato excelente, y la verdad es que lo consiguen. Los conserjes, siempre prestos a ayudar, tienen mucha información útil sobre sitios para comer, visitar, etc. 

En definitiva, un excelente hotel que apuntamos para futuras escapadas a Dublín.",4,2014,07,13

Muy recomendable el hotel.

Está en las afueras de Dublin, hay que tomar taxi para ir a la ciudad.",4,2014,07,01
204,Sehr gutes Personal,"Das Hotel hat meines Wissens fünf Sterne, aber diese Kategorie ist etwas überzogen. Andererseits liegt das Hotel wunderbar zentral, alles ist von dort aus fußläufig gut erreichbar. Sehr ruhiges Zimmer zum Innenhof, wenn auch relativ klein. Das Bad war in Ordnung. Das Mobiliar - außer des Bettes mit guter Matratze und ordentlichen Kissen - ist etwas veraltet und ramponiert, der Kleiderschrank nicht der Rede wert, dafür Bademäntel, Regenschirm, etc. verfügbar. Kleine Mängel, die bei einem Städtetripp nicht groß ins Gewicht fallen. Dafür außerordentliches Personal, sehr gutes Frühstück, schneller Service, tolle Hilfe beim online check-in für den Rückflug, was will man mehr? Das Hotel kann ich ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen. Dublin auch - unbedingt.",4,2014,06,11

204,Excelente Hotel en una ubicación inmejorable.,"Estuve en este hotel desde el 15 al 17 de Marzo de 2014 para la celebración de San Patricio.
EL hotel tiene todo lo que un cinco estrellas urbano tiene que tener. Con un estilo moderno muy equilibrado. No es excesivamente moderno ni tampoco un museo típico de estilo. Algo que tranquilamente se podría esperar en una ciudad de herencia medieval como Dublin (Detesto los hoteles museo). Las habitaciones estándar son muy cómodas y están muy bien equipadas. El servicio de desayuno es muy completo y lo mejor es la amabilidad y profesionalismo de todo su personal.
El desayuno superó ampliamente las expectativas. El mismo tenía dos opciones no excluyentes, sistema buffet y a la carta con variedad de desayunos irlandeses. Ambos de una calidad excelente.
La ubicación es una de las mejores ventajas de este hotel. Sobre todo si van en San Patricio ya que prácticamente se encuentra en el corazón de los festejos. 
Una excelente opción en Dublin.",4,2014,05,03
204,Austero. Antico. A pochi passi dal centro.,"Camere: ai piani alti ed interni, silenziose, ampie, ben arredate con salotto.
Alla reception, nella serata di arrivo, presenza di una ragazza che comprendeva bene l'irlandese e poco l'inglese.
La camera assegnata al 4° piano aveva il rubinetto del lavandino dell'acqua fredda che perdeva.
Ruggine lungo la modanatura in acciaio del lavandino a forma di tavolo (in legno e acciaio).
Il frigorifero con il sistema che addebita le bibite appena si sollevano dalla loro posizione. Quanto detto è descritto in un avviso appeso in posizione non evidente all'interno della porta in legno e solo in inglese (non vi sono altre lingue).
Difficile regolare la temperatura interna, nonostante due regolatori.

204,Ottima base per una visita della bella Dublino,"Abbiamo pernottato al Fitzwilliam Hotel tra Natale e Capodanno 2014. La carta vincente di quest'hotel è sicuramente la posizione, davvero invidiabile, vicino a tutto e affacciato sul meraviglioso parco di St. Stephen's Green.

Comodo anche se si prende la navetta dall'aeroporto, sono comunque solo 7/8 minuti a piedi nella zona pedonale, ed anche la fermata del bus panoramico è a brevissima distanza dall'hotel.
Le stanze non sono grandi ma molto accoglienti, moderne, ben tenute, pulite, con un bellissimo arredamento e un tocco in più dato da una graziosa e curata orchidea. Forse un po' troppo rumore dalle altre stanze e dal corridoio, ed il letto (queen) veramente molto piccolo per i nostri standard. 
Abbiamo fatto la colazione una sola mattina, c'è la possibilità di scegliere varie tipologie di colazione (irish, continentale..) e ci è parsa molto completa e abbondante, seppur non economica. In alternativa, a due passi dall'hotel ci sono pasticcerie e bar altrettanto soddisfacenti. 
Il servizio di concierge ottimo, sempre molto disponibile sia per suggerimenti e consigli, sia per aiutare nella  prenotazione di ristoranti, concerti, mezzi di trasporto. 
Da consigliare vivamente per un comodo, confortevole e bel soggiorno a Dublino.",5,2014,02,23
204,Un hotel encantador,"El hotel cumplió todas nuestras expectativas, tanto en cuanto a sus instalaciones como  por el trato,  la amabilidad y la profesionalidad de la mayoría del personal que hizo que nuestra estancia en Dublín fuera muy agradable. 
La ubicación del hotel es inmejorable, el entorno muy agradable y el desayuno muy recomendable. Además del  autoservicio,  puedes elegir entre diferentes platos o bebidas calientes, si lo deseas . Las habitaciones son realmente confortables y la limpieza impecable. Son, además, silenciosas, algo que particularmente, siempre he valorado. Apenas escuché sonidos del exterior o de las habitaciones colindantes.  
Mención especial para el personal de recepción y  concierge que, siempre atentos a nuestras peticiones y con una sonrisa en los labios, nos ayudaron a sentirnos como en casa. Desde luego, me volvería a alojar allí, sin dudarlo.",4,2014,02,18
204,Complessivamente raccomandabile,"Per una breve vacanza a Dublino è perfetto, posizione strategica.
L'Hotel è molto carino, due nei : l ' attesa per entrare al ristorante per la colazione e le camere belle ma un po' piccole per un 5 stelle.",4,2013,12,04
204,Un buon inizio per la luna di miele,"Avendo deciso di passare la nostra Honeymoon in Irlanda, ci è stato inserito come primo albergo del nostro tour proprio il Fitzwilliam di Dublino.
Ottima posizione, in centro e a 2 passi da Temple Bar.
Non sapevano che eravamo in viaggio di nozze, ma tempo zero ci hanno fatto trovare due calici di champagne in camera. Purtroppo dalla nostra finestra non avevamo vista... ovvero, dava su un cortile interno. In ogni caso molto elegante. Free wi-fi in tutto l'albergo. Colazione internazionale e Irish. La doccia era nella vasca, con la classica tendina.Tutto molto pulito e curato. Riassettata più volte al giorno. Ombrelli a disposizione. Clima + caloriferi. TV lcd. Phon professionale a disposizione. Ciabatte in spugna a corredo.",4,2013,10,19
204,La perfezione esiste!,"Splendido hotel come pochi se ne trovano in giro. Struttura e servizio adeguati alle stelle: camere belle e pulitissime, silenziose (la nostra dava sul giardino interno) e dotate di ogni comfort, personale gentile e disponibile, posizione ottima, colazione di ottima qualità e abbondante.
L'unica pecca potrebbe essere il ristorante (non per il servizio in camera che ha un menu a parte ed è ineccepibile sia nella qualità, sia nella dimensione delle porzioni), ma credo sia un problema riservato a chi, come me, è italiano.",5,2013,09,11
204,Buon hotel fronte St. Stephens nella city,"L'hotel e' moderno e ben  arredato e gestito con ottimo personale   . Buono il breakfast. Le camere sono  belle e silenziose salvo in estate quelle fronte parco specie il venerdì e sabato sera per la musica in strada. La posizione e'ottima , di fronte ad un parco della city tenuto come un gioiello. Buona scelta nel complesso . ",4,2013,08,29
204,niente di che,"contrariamente ad altri recensori io ho trovato l'hotel piuttosto anonimo
personale tutt'altro che simpatico e disponibile, comunissima camera da albergo categoria ""affari""
tra l'altro me ne è stata assegnata una con vista sui giardini di saint stephen ed è stato un piacere fino a che non mi sono reso conto che si trovava anche sopra ad un locale che la sera si è trasformato in una sorta di discoteca con musica a tutto volume che mi ha pesantemente diturbato le prime ore di sonno
la cosa migliore dell'hotel è la sua posizione nel pieno centro di dublino il che consente di raggiungere a piedi ogni meta di interesse",3,2013,08,25
204,3 notti da 5 stelle lusso,"Sono stato benissimo in questo hotel posto proprio dinnanzi a st Stephen green , le stanze cosi come l intera struttura risulta molto lussuosa , inoltre le stanze vengono sistemate 2 volte al giorno, il costo complessivo è un pò alto ma se volete fare una sorpresa è il posto ideale , molto belle sono anche il lounge bar e la hall con dove c'è un camino sempre acceso ",5,2013,02,04
204,MUY BUEN HOTEL,"Habitaciones muy amplias y de diseño moderno (lo cual es muy dificil de encontrar) muy luminosas. camas excelentes, internet de alta velocidad incluido en el precio. de agradecer el equipo de musica y la maquina para preparar té y cafe incluidos en la habitacion sin algun coste adicional. tambien he apreciado mucho el hecho de que tuviesen plantas y flores naturales en la habitacion (orquideas) asi como el servicio de apertura de cama. el desayuno lo encontré algo pobre, para ser un hotel de 5 estrellas, en mi opinion falta mas variedad y surtido de fruta fresca, panes, bolleria...no tuve ocasion de probar el irish full breakfast pero a esas horas de la manana meterse todo eso en el cuerpo es solo para valientes. lo dicho, mi unico pero fue el desayuno, del que me esperaba mas variedad y calidad. optima ubicacion. personal algo, bueno bastante seco, salvo el conserje, les cuesta saludarte cuando te encuentran por los pasillos, ni que decir que te sonrian... ahh y lo mas ""feo"" que te cargan un deposito de 100 euros al hacer el chek in SIN informarte y despues necesitan la friolera de 7 dias para desbloquearte dicha cantidad.una verguenza, presenté mi queja en la recepcion pero veo que no soy la primera ni la ultima cliente y desgraciadamente el hotel hace caso omiso a dicha queja comun de sus clientes, una pena...",4,2013,01,22
204,Da consigliare,"Un ottimo cinque stelle sia come servizi che come cura dei dettagli. 
Spazi comuni e stanza veramente curati, belli e funzionali. Colazione molto curata e buona. Personale attento a qualsiasi esigenza. Posizione dell'hotel secondo me eccellente, vicino a tutto e con la vista sul parco molto rilassante.
Unica ""pecca"" è stata l'insonorizzazione della stanza rispetto all'interno dell'hotel: mentre dall'esterno e dalle stanze comunicanti non perveniva nessun rumore, dal corridoio si sentivano le voci e i rumori. 

Comunque resta un ottimo hotel, sicuramente da consigliare.",4,2013,01,09
204,bellissimo,"Veramente veramente bellissimo. Sono stato a Dublino diverse volte, ma non ero mai stato in questo bellissimo albergo. Veramente molto lussuoso e confortevole. Belle camere, complete di tutto, pulitissime. Colazione monumentale come si richiede ad un buon albergo anglosassone. L'accoglienza è quella classica degli irlandesi, molto più che a casa. Tanto di cappello !",5,2013,01,07
204,"Sehr zentral, ganz nette Zimmer, Aubzüge gibt es für den Teppichverleger","Alles in allem ein ganz nettes Hotel. Der erste Eindruck ist modern und schick. Die zentrale Lage ist ein absoluter Pluspunkt. Die Zimmer sind angenehm groß und ganz nett eingerichtet. Ein Mix aus modern und älteren Elementen (Spiegel , Dusche). Der Teppich war für mich ein Minuspunkt. Er ist nicht nur besonders hässlich, sondern auch schlecht verlegt (Ritzen zwischen den einzelnen Teilen) - und das im ganzen Haus. Das Badezimmer war sehr sauber und gepflegt und mit allem ausgestattet was man benötigt.
Die Hotel Bar ist für ein Feierabendbier ok, bietet aber sonst nicht viel Besonderes.",4,2012,10,25
204,Ruhig aber sehr zentral,"Das Hotel liegt ruhig aber sehr zentral. Vor dem Hotel beginnt die Grafton Street und man befindet sich direkt im Zentrum Dublins.
Das Personal war sehr zuvorkommend.
Zimmer sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet.
Ein Stadthotel zum wohlfühlen.
Bei einem erneuten Besuch von Dublin würde ich es immer wieder buchen.",5,2012,10,06
204,Optimale Lage. Modern und edel.,"Von der Lage (Mitten im Zentrum) nicht zu übertreffen. Trotzdem sehr ruhig und nach Möglichkeit mit Blick in den Park und Wasser.
Modern und edel eingerichtet. Badewanne und separate Dusche (mit Wasserfall-Qualität). Samstag-Nacht allerdings noch bis ca. 3 Uhr noch Musik von angrenzenden Club hörbar (trotz 3.OG).",5,2012,07,02
204,Atención por novatos,"Reserve una promoción varios meses antes. Al llegar nos dieron una habitación muy coqueta pero minúscula, no teníamos donde apoyar las maletas. No había amenities y luego de esperar tres horas por shampoo, tuve que ir a buscarlo a la recepción de un hotel de ""5 estrellas??"".
La ubicación es buena, pero no sabia que sacar una promoción era tener una habitación del tamaño de una ratonera.",2,2012,06,09
204,ottima posizione,"ottima la posizione per visitare la città:adiacente a molti centri commerciali ed alla strada pedonale dello shopping, a pochi minuti anche la fermata del City Sightseeing (i biglietti possono essere acquistati in albergo senza maggiorazione prezzi).Nelle adiacenze,cinque minuti a piedi, anche il più grande casinò di Dublino: Emporium. Personale gentilissimo, le camere non sono molto grandi ma arredate  con gusto, colori inusuali e complete di ogni confort, anche candele ambient, ottima la crema per il corpo. Comodo un sistema di sedute davanti la finestra.Ci sono stata pochi giorni fa, temperatura bassissima , ma in albergo ero accolta da un focolare sempre acceso.Colazione buona ed abbondante, solo il caffè , sia espresso che americano, non era eccezionale.",4,2012,05,01
204,Toller Aufenthalt bei unserem dritten Besuch in Dublin,"Wir haben hier 4 Naechte verbracht.  Es gibt (fast) nichts zu meckern. Sehr schoene Zimmer, bequeme Betten, ein sehr sehr aufmerksamer Roomservice. Die Bar ist sehr nett und die Lage des Hotels perfekt. Fast alles ist binnen 10 min Fußweg erreichbar. Wir koennen es jedenfalls sehr empfehlen. Gezahlt haben wir fuer diese Annehmlichkeiten gut 150 euro die Nacht ohne Fruehstueck. Das ist sehr okay. 

2 kleine Dinge zum Schluss, die man verbessern koennte: Die TV Sender sind ausschl. irisch/britisch. Da muesste es internationaler sein. Und Tradition hin oder her: Ans Waschbecken gehoeren Mischbatterien und nicht ein Heiß- und ein Kaltwasserhahn. ",5,2012,02,18
204,sistemazione eccellente,"sistemazione ideale vicinissima al centro città, camere un poco piccole ma di grande charme, servizio e pulizia ottimi. Eccellente il servizio all'help desk.
Breakfast ricco e di ottimo livello.",5,2012,01,01
204,Uno de los mejores hoteles en los que hemos estado.,"La situación del hotel es inmejorable, ya que está a un paseo de cualquier sitio, sin estar justo en el centro, donde hay ruido hasta muy tarde. 
La habitación tenía todo lo necesario y más. Además, al llegar al hotel nos dijeron que nos darían una habitación superior a la estándar que habíamos reservado. Ésta tenía una terraza, que aunque hacia frío y no la pudimos disfrutar como si hubiese sido verano, tenía unas vistas fantásticas. 
El personal fue muy amable. 
El único ""pero"" fue el precio del desayuno, 22€ por persona hicieron que desayunáramos fuera. ",5,2011,11,19
204,Excelente hotel,"Localización perfecta, personal amable y eficaz. Limpieza y mantenimiento excelentes. Buena decoración e instalaciones. Desayuno bueno pero no excelente. Comida en la cafetería regular.",5,2011,11,08
204,Ausgezeichntes Hotel im Herzen von Dublin,"Dublin bietet eine große Hotelauswahl. Deshalb hat man manchmal die Qual der Wahl. Das Fitzwilliam ist jedenfalls aus mehreren Gründen sehr zu empfehlen. Die Lage ist genial. Neben dem Park gelegen, ist man mit ein paar Schritten schon im Zentrum. Design von Terrence Conran, jeder Zentimeter wurde ausgenutzt. Die Zimmer sind zwar eher klein, aber von ausreichender Größe. und sie bieten alles, was man sich wünscht. Unser Zimmer war im 5. Stock, nach hinten gelegen und herrlich ruhig. Concierge, Garage, WLAN - alles bestens. Einzig das Personal beim Frühstück könnte besser geschult und aufmerksamer sein. Aber ansonsten hat alles gepasst. Sehr zu empfehlen.",4,2011,08,23
204,"El mejor Hotel de Dublin, segun la gente de Dublin","Habitacion muy agradable que daba a un patio de manzana, muy silencioso y tranquilo con bonitos arboles y plantas .
Buen desayuno y muy completo.
Situacion inmejorable en pleno centro, al lado de la calle Grafton y muy cerca de la estatua de Molly Malone.",5,2011,08,21
204,"Posizione perfetta, camere curate","La posizione dell'albergo è centralissima e piacevole, a poco distanza da Trinity College e le strade dello shopping.   Le camere sono piccole ma molto curate, con mobili moderne e vista su St. Stephen's Green.   Il bagno è grandissimo.  La colazione offre moltissima scelta con buon servizio informale.  Ci sono ottime ristoranti nella vicinanze.  All'arrivo da l'impressione di un albergo d'affari, ma per il ns. soggiorno per turismo era perfetto.",4,2011,07,29
204,"Me encantó, muy bonito, personal muy amable","Me pareció todo muy bien. La situación muy buena, céntrico. El hotel muy bonito, el personal muy amable. Cenamos en el restaurante y como no teníamos ni idea de inglés, rápidamente llamaron a un camarero que sabía hablar español que nos trató fenomenal, la cena muy buena. La relación calidad-precio, también buenísima, me pareció barato.",5,2010,12,29
204,merita le 5 stelle,"Nulla di negativo sull'hotel: ottima prima colazione (con ampia scelta sia di cose dolci che di salato: uova, salsicce, legumi ecc), stanze raffinate e ben pulite, personale gentile e disponibile, ottima posizione (proprio vicino a Grafton Street, e si può arrivare facilmente a piedi in Dame Street e a Fleet Street).
Non sono in grado di dire come sia il rapporto qualità/prezzo sia ottimo, avendo acquistato un pacchetto turistico abbastanza costoso, comprendente anche i voli di linea che avevo prenotato solo pochi giorni prima., e che non so quanto abbiano inciso sul prezzo complessivo.",5,2010,11,19
204,Da können einem die Füße weh tun; hier kann man sich erholen,"Das Hotel kann ich nur empfehlen. Super Lage; tolle Zimmer; leckeres Frühstück; nette Bar. Wenn man die Stadt erkundet hat ist es wunderbar die müden Füße in diesem Hotel hochzulegen. Für Frauen ideal, da man abends nach einem Pubbesuch durch keine dunklen Strassen laufen muß. Alles ist in der Nähe und die Tüten muß man auch nicht weit schleppen.",5,2010,10,08
204,Muy céntrico y bonito,"Un hotel perfectamente situado, pequeño, pero muy cómodo. Lsa habitaciones algo pequeñas, pero el personal amabilisisimo. Nadie en el hotel hablaba español.",4,2010,09,15
204,gutes Hotel in Zentraler Lage,"Für ein Meeting in Dublin wurde das Fitzwilliam Hotel gebucht. Die Lage vom Hotel ist super. Direkt in der Innenstadt. Die kleinere und schönere Einkaufstrasse ist zu Fuss in 1 Minute zu erreichen. Templebar ( Tourimeile ) ist zu Fuss 10 Minuten und gegenüber vom Hotel liegt ein schöner Park zum schlendern. Das Zimmer ist durchschnittlich gross aber geschmackvoll und Farbenprächtik eingerichtet. Die Zimmer wruden 2006 renoviert , dementsprechend sind die Sachen teilweise nicht mehr ganz neu, aber immer noch ok.. GRATIS WIFI !",4,2010,08,16
204,Hervorragendes Business Hotel in Dublin,"Bei meinem 5. beruflichen Aufenthalt in Dublin habe ich nun zum ersten Mal im Fitzwilliam übernachtet und muss sagen: es ist in dieser Preisklasse das mit Abstand beste Business-Hotel in Dublin. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet, geräumig, sehr sauber, es gibt kostenloses Internet, ein schönes Frühstücksbuffet und sehr guten Service. Zudem ist die Lage am St. Stephens Green mit direktem Zugang zur Fußgängerzone (5 Min zum Trinity College) optimal. Ich war aufgrund des Asche-Chaos gezwungen meinen Aufenthalt mehrmals zu verlängern. Das Personal war dabei sehr entgegenkommend (tageweise Verlängerung) und es gab einen Gutschein für Restaurant/Bar/Laundry Service - wegen der Unannehmlichkeiten durch den Vulkan. Alles in allem: top Service, super Zimmer und damit eine klare Empfehlung.",5,2010,08,03
204,ottima posizione per un ottimo albergo,"Albergo di buon livello, con ottimi servizi, camere ben curate e confortevoli e personale attento e disponibile. La posizione è perfetta per girare la città comodamente a piedi o con i servizi",5,2010,01,05
204,Ottimo Hotel,"Davvero bello, ho soggiornato in questo hotel per il capodanno e lo consiglio vivamente.
Le camere sono molto carine ed arredate con gusto, come tutto il resto dell'hotel, le pulizie vengono fatte due volte al giorno e la posizione è centralissima, su Grafton street che è una delle vie principali dello shopping.
Nell'hotel ci sono due ristoranti uno dei quali decisamente più caro sui 100 €, ma anche tra i migliori della città!
Consigliato!",5,2010,01,04
204,Ottimo albergo,"Abbiamo trascorso due notti e devo dire che siamo stati davvero bene. La camera, moderna e grande, il bagno molto grande, insomma tutto perfetto!",5,2009,07,19
204,centralissimo e molto bello,"Dire che il Fitzwilliam Hotel ha una posizione centrale è riduttivo: è nel cuore di Dublino!Si trova  a due passi (e sono veramente DUE..)da Grafton Street ed è di fronte a uno dei parchi più importanti e affascinanti della città.
L'hotel è bellissimo, raffinato e pulito.Lo consiglio vivamnte a tutti!",5,2009,06,05
