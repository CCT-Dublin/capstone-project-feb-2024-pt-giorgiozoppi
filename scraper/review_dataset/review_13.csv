13,"Perfect location, excellent staff!","The customer service was amazing! From the breakfast buffet to Ivan in the lobby, we were very impressed. Great location as well! The rooms were beautiful, and the terrace is a perfect outdoor experience. Did we mention Ivan is amazing? We felt very taken care of. Thank you!",5,2024,10,14
13,Historical Gem.,"The Cotton House Hotel reveals its origins in multiple ways.  There is a Fabric Book filled with cloth fabrics in each room - in case you wanted to have someone take your measurements to have a shirt made with your chosen fabrics.

In addition, the walls of one of the dining rooms are filled with bolts of fabric.  A clothespin adorns the orange peel in a cocktail.  And the linen napkins are tied with, what else, a tiny bit of gold fabric.

The service is wonderful and the food very good.  The terrace is delightfully arranged with banks of settees along the exterior and small sitting areas for smaller groups.  The concierge, Gina, allowed us to reserve a settee to celebrate our grandson’s 21st birthday one night; another example of wonderful service and attention to details that matter.

We would absolutely return to this hotel and highly recommend it.",5,2024,10,10
13,An amazing place to stay!,"Loved this hotel! The location was perfect and the rooms were small but clean and had a very cool vibe. The communal rooms were beautiful! The staff was amazing from the moment our taxi dropped us off. The on-site restaurant was very cool and again the staff was amazing. Their porn star martini is the best! Vito and Camilo were very friendly and attentive. I wish I could remember everyone’s names because they were all truly wonderful, from giving us recommendations on our next stops to providing fantastic service. I highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,10,02
13,Great Hotel,"This hotel was delightful! The rooms were so cute, and the staff was exceptionally kind and helpful. I especially appreciated how they upheld old traditions with their custom shirts. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and I look forward to staying there again our next time in Barcelona.",5,2024,09,26
13,Great 2nd stay!,"This was our second time staying at the Cotton House hotel.  We got upgraded to a very nice room.  Great location and nice, quiet hotel.  The breakfast is great and the staff is too!  Reyes helped us with our bags and getting a taxi.  He is very warm and personable!",5,2024,09,26
13,All thumbs up for Cotton House,"We had an absolutely incredible stay at the Cotton House Hotel—a true 5-star experience! Our time at Batuar Bar was unforgettable. I think we tried every type of spritz ever invented, and each one was better than the last. The outdoor terrace, bathed in sunlight, was the perfect spot to enjoy The weekend only downtempo house music, along with some lounge and lo-fi electronic tunes that set such a chill vibe.

What made our stay even more memorable was the outstanding service from Reyes. He went above and beyond, refusing to let us lift a finger as he helped with our bags, and he even waited with us until our car arrived. Reyes made us feel so special, and when we tried to tip him, he graciously refused. 

Reyes, if you’re reading this—send me your Venmo or PayPal account, damn it! We love you and Cotton House is so lucky to have you!

From start to finish, everything about the Cotton House was perfection. We can't wait to return! Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a luxurious and warm stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,09,09
13,Fabulous Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"Our stay at The Cotton House in Barcelona was a testament to the power of exceptional hospitality, with elegant surroundings, warm staff, and outstanding service that left a lasting impression. The in-house restaurant, Batua, delivered a world-class dining experience with flawless service and mouthwatering cuisine. As a valued Lifetime Platinum and Titanium Platinum member, I was delighted with the upgrades for my three rooms. The hotel's thoughtful gestures - champagne, a personalized note, and a decadent birthday cake - made our celebrations unforgettable, honoring my wedding anniversary and mother-in-law's milestone birthday in style. We can't wait to return!",5,2024,08,31
13,Another great stay at Cotton House,"Second stay at Cotton House. Great, elegant hotel in a good location. Got a nice upgrade as a Marriott Titanium Elite. Every staff member was extremely friendly and helpful. Really nice breakfast and the bar was excellent too. Highly recommend Cotton House.",5,2024,08,29
13,Accommodating to the highest level .,"The hotel could not have been more accommodating.  I left my prescription eyeglasses at the hotel and they quickly found them after I left the country.  They were also as gracious, efficient, and as  kind as possible in shipping them back to my home in the USA.  Everything and everyone was wonderful.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,08,26
13,The Cotton House is as luxurious as fine Egyptian cotton.,"We stayed at the Cotton House in Barcelona prior to our Virgin cruise. It is a gorgeous, historic property. The people here are very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was delicious, and the service there was first rate. The hotel itself is full of nice artwork, beautiful furniture, and interesting lighting. We would be delighted to come back here.",5,2024,08,25
13,Marriott didn’t disappoint,"My stay at the Marriott Cotton House Hotel was a delightful experience from start to finish. I had been in contact with the staff for some time due to a delayed arrival, initially planned for April but pushed to August. It was wonderful to finally put faces to the names I had been communicating with, and I was warmly welcomed upon check-in. To my pleasant surprise, I received a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful room overlooking the courtyard with a charming restaurant.

The hotel truly went above and beyond to make my birthday special. My room was decorated with a thoughtful birthday shoutout on the mirror, a balloon, a delicious chocolate cake with a candle, and a bottle of cava. The room itself was elegant and comfortable, featuring a luxurious rainfall shower, and I had a restful night’s sleep in the cozy bed.

The hotel offers both a breakfast buffet and a limited à la carte menu, catering to various preferences. Its central location made it convenient for exploring the city, adding to the overall convenience and charm of my stay.

While most of my experience was wonderful, I have to mention my massage. The masseuse was a third-party provider from El Palace Hotel. Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming. The massage room was basic, without the typical spa amenities like a steam room or sauna. The masseuse was friendly but did not apply enough pressure despite my request, leaving me feeling the same as when I walked in. Although the hotel offered a 10% discount, it didn’t make up for what felt like a wasted investment. I genuinely hope the masseuse finds her true calling because, sadly, this doesn’t seem to be it.

Despite the massage, I would highly recommend Marriott Cotton House Hotel for its exceptional service, thoughtful touches, and comfortable accommodations. Just be cautious when booking additional services.",5,2024,08,24
13,We had an absolutely amazing time at the Cotton House Hotel,"We had an absolutely amazing time at the Cotton House Hotel. The rooms were cozy and spotless, with great décor, a very comfortable bed, and soft linens. The staff was attentive and went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable.

On the last night of our stay, upon returning to the hotel, we went to the front desk to request a cab for our early departure at 6:45 a.m. We were greeted by a very friendly blonde night receptionist named Janina. She asked us how our stay at the hotel had been.

We were pleasantly surprised by her question and started talking about our experience at the hotel and in Barcelona. Her demeanor made us feel at ease. We told her that everything had been wonderful except for one small detail: we hadn’t been able to have breakfast. On the first day, we went to breakfast and were told it wasn't included. We assumed this meant we didn’t have breakfast included for the entire three-day stay.

Janina quickly checked our reservation and confirmed that breakfast was indeed included. She apologized on behalf of herself and the hotel. Since we were leaving very early and she couldn’t correct the mistake, she offered to personally prepare a picnic breakfast for us and she did.

Without a doubt, this has been our best experience at a hotel. We will definitely return, and we highly recommend it because it’s wonderful.",5,2024,08,21
13,Beautiful hotel,"A beautiful hotel in a very good location, central to good shopping and dining. The staff was very attentive. The restaurant was delicious. The rooms were exquisitely decorated. The rooftop pool and bar was small, but had a very metropolitan vibe. Highly recommend!",5,2024,08,06
13,Superb staff : beautiful hotel,"This perfectly sized hotel has good facilities and location, but retains a personal service.  The location is great (short distance from major shopping areas).  Omar the concierge was excellent - really helpful and super professional.  Pool is small, but great views.

Breakfast was great and the secluded garden/terrace is perfect.  Rooms are comfortable and the chilled water dispensers are a fantastic idea. 

Overall though, it is the staff which make this hotel.  Everyone we encountered went out of their way to provide superior service.  Thankyou for a brilliant experience",5,2024,07,23
13,Fabulous hotel. Highly recommend.,"From the minute we arrived it felt like home, not just another hotel. The deco is fabulous and the Cava (bubbles) on arrival was a lovely touch. 
The staff are amazing - so genuine, friendly and helpful. The food was excellent and the outdoor dining / drinks area is lovely. Breakfast outside is like dining in an oasis and having a drink there at night is a great way to end the day. 
We were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous. Lots of light and so much space - a real treat. Standard rooms are not huge but still enough space for bags etc and nice bathroom. The linen and towels are top quality and I love the large containers of shampoo, soap etc instead of lots of little bottles. 
The pool is small and not many chairs so go in the morning or early afternoon and when it’s quieter. A lovely little bar by the pool and staff are great coming to offer drinks etc. 
Great location and easy to walk everywhere or catch a taxi. Would definitely stay again. Highly recommend.",5,2024,07,22
13,It was a cool but just ok hotel,"We got one of the suits in this hotel. The hotel was beautiful, we love all the little details the hotel offers. The suit was spacious and the hotel was quiet at night.
The people who checked us in at the hotel entrance were very friendly and nice but the ones that were sitting at the desk on second floor seemed bored and were uninterested to crack a smile when they saw you lol. They just ignored you and did some personal stuff at work ( some on their phone, some were chatting on their computers…) 
Room service was hit and miss. They didn’t provide any daily normal stuffs even you get one of the nicest suits… 
This is definitely not a 5 star hotel.",3,2024,07,19
13,Great Service!,"Lovely boutique hotel with great service. We only wish we could have stayed longer. Rooftop pool is a bit small but we aren’t sun worshipers so no matter. The breakfast spread is FANTASTIC.

Upon our departure the great service continued with Reyes who was such a pleasure with helping us get a cab and handling our bags.",5,2024,07,16
13,Chefs kiss,"This is a beautiful five star hotel so you can expect any of the typical five star amenities like lovely bedding, towels, subtle but beautiful smelling bath products, etc. The lobby and room are beautiful, but what was really great was the service we received from the person that checked us in, Lotte, and the doorman, Reyes, who helped us and our friends (who were staying at a different hotel) catch a cab from the hotel. They got all the details before acting, were helpful, and professional.",5,2024,07,10
13,"Gorgeous hotel and fabulous, attentive service staff!","Gorgeous lobby, small but sumptuous room.  From the moment we checked in, we were treated beautifully.  We had lunch on the patio, gorgeous drinks and wonderful selection of small bites.  The pool was also beautiful and it was so nice to have bar service there as well.  Front desk was truly helpful in every area, from making dinner reservations to bus schedules.  Can't wait to stay here again!",5,2024,07,07
13,Cotton House Hotel,"We stayed here before our cruise and I have tell tell you the staff here was outstanding,  from helping us check in early,  to the turn down service,  and Reyes at the door the experience was amazing.  The food and drinks were spectacular,  the rooms were beautiful and clean.  I highly recommend this hotel.  Thank you for a great stay.",5,2024,07,02
13,Amazing hotel and staff,"What a nice experience we had. Great location, beautiful hotel. The Terrace is a must and the concierge team especially Keto are very helpful. The doorman is exceptional - institution by himself. A must stay, we will definitely be back. Thank you",5,2024,06,29
13,Perfection,"This is a top notch, club level hotel. The setting and decor are wonderful, and this is complimented by a wonderful staff. Everyone that we interacted with at the hotel and restaurant were extremely professional and totally customer service oriented. The trainees were better than experienced staff at any other hotel we have stayed. The valets/porters were exceptional, Reyes and Deep in particular made our transitions in and out smooth and seamless. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,06,28
13,Great for ignoring guests,"A beautiful hotel if you want to be ignored at check in and in the restaurant.  Lifetime Platinum member who was forced to wait over 2 hours past check in time to get a room (and this was after contacting a manager).  Then in the morning the staff in the restaurant totally ignored me when I asked for a coffee so I went down the street.  At breakfast the staff acted like we didn’t exist.

Stay here for the beautiful accommodations but don’t expect good or even average service.",2,2024,06,25
13,Family stay was awesome!,"The entire staff was most accommodating and extremely respectful.  The service was very good, great breakfast spread, awesome drinks at the bar and outside patio, good rooftop pool and bar and @Reyes was always helpful in the lobby, handling car service, hailing cabs, and most importantly with the flow of water and champagne.  Oh and the suite upgrade was much appreciated. Definitely would choose Cotton House again for our family of 7.",5,2024,06,22
13,Historic Cotton Factory now Boutique Hotel,"Beautiful historic property, gorgeous spacious rooms w/bath & shower - plus A/C. Rooftop pool - patio with view. Restaurant & bar hop inside. 
Expensive rooms. Slow to get rooms ready on time when busy, but grab a walk, go shopping .. a drink.",4,2024,06,09
13,Amazing time in Barcelona,"We had an amazing stay at the Cotton House. We wee traveling with family so had the opportunity to see two different type of rooms. The room with patio was beautiful.  Our room was nice as well it waz in an interior courtyard so was quiet, bed was extremely comfortable The  restaurant was great for cocktails.  The staff was exceptional and made you feel at home. From the welcome drink, to restaurant and tour recommendations they were extremely helpful. I would recommend this hotel for its service and location",5,2024,06,09
13,Thoroughly enjoyable stay,"We arrived early after departing a cruise ship.  Our room was not ready, but we were still given our welcome glass of cava to begin our stay.  The room was ready at the regular time and our luggage, which we had stored, was brought to our room.  It was a beautiful room on the sixth floor overlooking the courtyard.  It was large enough for our needs and had sufficient closet and drawer space.  It was very clean.
The hotel is quirky and charming.  The staff was very nice.  The Gossypium (concierge) group was very helpful.  We also enjoyed the welcome gifts and the chocolates brought with the turn down service.  The location worked out very well for us, in that it was a close enough walk to many places.
We enjoyed the restaurant, both for cocktails on the patio and for the breakfast buffet.",5,2024,05,31
13,Save your time and money,The trip started out well the first day. Went down hill after that. The service in the restaurant was horrible. Rude staff and mediocre food. The room was a “family room” and was very cramped. It was located next to the restaurant and we heard music until 2 am on Saturday night. Never got a good nights rest. The towels and sheets were incredible. The pillows were worst than an airplane travel pillow!  Save your money and go elsewhere. Can’t believe this is still a Marriott property!  Three days later and I still have not received a copy of my bill. Nor is it available on the Marriott/Bonvoy app.,1,2024,05,30
13,Fabulous terrace,The best thing about this hotel is the outdoor terrace. It is gorgeous and a wonderful place to relax with a cocktail. I also really enjoyed the breakfast. The cook to order items were the best we had on our trip (we stayed in five different cities/hotels). Service was good. Our room was nice and comfortable but small (smaller than the pictures on the website imply). I was especially impressed by how well the windows blocked out the street noise. The location is okay. I would probably have enjoyed staying in the historic area better.,4,2024,05,28
13,"The Worst Marriott Hotel, Bar None","This is the worst Marriott hotel I have ever stayed in. It's the first time I've encountered a hotel that goes out of its way to say ""no"" to guests.

The story is simple: I checked into the Cotton House Hotel on May 11th at noon. Since the room needed cleaning, we left our luggage at the front desk, completed the check-in process, and went to explore Barcelona. At check-in, we requested a firmer pillow and a blanket from the front desk clerk, who promised to provide them and assured us they would be delivered to our room along with our luggage.

We returned to the front desk around 6 PM, got our room keys, and went to the room, only to find that neither the pillow, the blanket, nor our luggage had been delivered. My wife assumed they had simply forgotten, but this was just the beginning of our worst experience: my wife went downstairs to speak with the front desk. To my surprise, she returned alone, dragging our two large suitcases. Despite multiple staff members, including bellboys, seeing her struggle with the luggage, no one offered to help. She reiterated our request for a pillow and a blanket at the front desk, and they responded they would look into it.

By 10 PM, we had received no response. I called the front desk to repeat our request, and they said they would continue looking. Almost an hour later, a rude knock on the door was followed by an arrogant staff member (whom my wife recognized as the bellboy who had ignored her earlier) handing her two sheets. He claimed they were the only items they could find, adding, ""OK? OK!"" in a haughty manner to end the conversation. I was on the balcony and didn't see this exchange, but I heard the rude tone. When I saw the sheets, I realized this was not just about a lack of firmer pillows or blankets but about discrimination.

 I rushed to the lobby with 2 sheets and asked the front desk if the hotel manager was available. Another arrogant staff member said the manager was not available and that I could speak to her instead. I asked if there were no blankets in the entire hotel. She said there weren't. I asked what they would provide if a guest felt cold in their room. She said the two sheets I was holding. I asked if she was sure, as a staff member of a Marriott hotel, that this was the help they offered. At this point, another male staff member (could be seen in my photos) appeared and reiterated that the two sheets were considered blankets. The absurdity of this conversation almost made me laugh in anger. I then asked, ""If I record this conversation, will you say on camera that the sheets I’m holding are what you consider blankets in English, OK?"" They then realized that continuing to lie would leave them no way out. Note:  that I don't speak Spanish, and all my conversations with them were in English, they also did.

At this moment, a more senior-looking madam emerged from a room behind the front desk and said, ""Sorry, I'll get you a blanket."" This was the first time I heard an apology.

This madam accompanied me to the floor, and as I calmed down, I explained that my wife was on her period and we needed an extra blanket, but I hadn't expected it to be extrodinary difficult. She apologized and asked if she could send up a bottle of wine or something, which I declined. After such a struggle, I had no mood for wine; I just wanted the blanket. This lady took just a minute to find a blanket from our floor and handed it to me. I thanked her and returned to the room to rest.

As my wife and I were preparing to sleep, a man knocked on the door with two cups of tea, saying he was a supervisor and willing to provide any service we needed. But we were too tired, so we thanked him and went to sleep.

The next day, upon returning to our room after touring I saw a bottle of champagne and a postcard offering any service we might need.

I don't think these efforts were enough. I paid nearly 1000 euros per night to stay in this hotel, yet I spent the entire evening arguing just to get a blanket. Sorry,  a 30-euro bottle of champagne doesn't change my negative review of this hotel's service.

I stayed for only two nights and then left. A week later, when I returned to Barcelona, I specifically chose the Grand Hyatt. In fact, I also stayed at the AC Hotel in Barcelona and the JW Marriott in Madrid during my stay in Spain.  In these hotels, my wife and I never had any issues with our requests for pillows and blankets.

Having stayed at Marriott hotels hundreds of times, I must say that the Cotton House Hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.",1,2024,05,26
13,Amazing staff 5 stars from Star to Finish,"I don’t normally write reviews, but I had to after a wonderful stay at Cotton House Hotel. We were warmly greeted after entering the lobby and the check-in process was quick, and the bellman was fantastic. First he helped us with our luggage, then later he escorted us to our room.

The room exceeded our expectations. It was spacious, well appointed, and best of all there was the comfortable bed! but possibly the best surprise was night manager Geanina. 

Geanina was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. Due our jet lag, this was our first visit to Barcelona and Europe, and from the very first moment, she became our personal assistant and was there every step of the way to make sure we had the best stay ever and she answered every night all of our questions. 

If we will visit Barcelona again and definitely stay at Cotton House Hotel.",5,2024,05,23
13,Cozy stay in Barcelona,"Such a beautiful hotel in a prime location of the city. Every staff member was super welcoming, helpful and hospitality forward. The restaurant staff were excellent having breakfast everyday there and everything was delicious. Bar crew were stellar and Alessio is one of our favorite bartenders in all of Barcelona (seriously go see him and put your trust in him) - we honestly tried to go to other “worlds 50 best bars” but had more fun learning with him 

Rooftop is very nice, a bit far from Sagrada to see much and the pool is more of a tiny plunge spot.

The rooms were ok but the layout was pretty odd and there’s 0 privacy for our tiny room. A see through shower from the bed and a door that only pushes in. The floors were also bubbled up, probably from water damage of people coming out of the shower. 

Overall terrific hotel and maybe we just got the wrong tier of rooms, still $$$",4,2024,05,20
13,This is one special hotel!,"Beyond special!  Great location, staff is incredible, breakfast is well worth it. If you can dress up and go next door to El Palace for a drink. Old time fabulous.  The architecture and history of Cotton House is wonderful. We wandered around staring at the ceilings.",5,2024,05,16
13,Thumps up!!,"Outstanding Service and hospitality.
Amazing building in the middle of the City. Very big rooms, exklusive furtniture. 
Also very nice shady terrasse with a good restaurant. All the staff are very friendly and professionell. special thanks to Geanina and Carla, who made our stay memorable…
highly recommended",5,2024,05,14
13,Just Lovely,The Cotton House was an excellent stay.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The bar and restaurant is top notch.  Breakfast every morning in the courtyard was a highlight.  Beautiful building.  Bed was very comfortable.  Highly recommend.,5,2024,05,09
13,Still a place to stay in the heart of Barcelona,"We were here a few years a go and had fond remembrances of the elegance of the hotel, It is still a great place to stay because of the location, which is central to most attractions, the responsive and friendly service, and comfortable environment. however, the hotel is overdue for a facelift, The furnishings show signs of heavy wear and tear and do detract from the experience.

Also, the top floors do experience some occasional noise intrusions.

Would still recommend with these reservations.",4,2024,05,05
13,Silk & Cotton Voyage,This has been a magical ambience inspired on the route of silk and cotton. It was just a magnificent experience surrounded by exquisite elegance embroidered by the touch of contemporary melancholy. Not only because of the excellent service of the staff at the Batuar Restaurant Bar but also because of the friendly and charming bellboy at the entrance and the reception staff. Everything exudes excellence and exquisiteness in every corner. Thank you for everything I will come back again. Because when something turns to memory it’s forever.,5,2024,04,27
13,Wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Beautiful boutique hotel with fabulous decor where attention to details was not spared. The room was cozy but a bit small. The most comfy bedding with luxurious sheets which added pluses to my sleep quality. The ottoman suite was fantastic, spacious and stunning!  The stuff was super friendly. Lucia concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and always had a great attitude.  Mario at the reception was beyond helpful and courteous. Thank you! I had the most delicious dinner at Batuar. Totally indulged myself and can't express how enjoyable the dinner was. The cerviche was amazing and so was the pork (the best I ever had) Nabil's recommendation. The manager was super attentive, whom was a pleasure to deal with.  Breakfast was also very nice.   Overall my stay was wonderful but the friendly stuff made it even better. I highly recommend CH and specially Batuar restaurant.",5,2024,04,17
13,The Cotton House is a magnificant hotel,"The Cotton House is a magnificant hotel.  It is a former headquarters of the Barcelona textile industry back in the day and the lobby, bar, lounge and spiral staircase up to the rooms are simply stunning.  I had breakfast there every day and it was delicious, with great omlets, pastry and coffee as well as other options. The rooms are a little small but well appointed.   All of the staff, from the servers to the front desk, were helpful, courteous and just really pleasant people.  I want to commend especially the concierges, several who were trainees but also the more experienced concierge who worked with them.   They graciously helped me with the barrage of questions that I had for them, including great suggestions for restaurants, tour guides, and clubs.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2024,04,11
13,Excellent!,"Cannot say enough about the hotel and the staff.   Top notch in every way.   Would not consider it for families with small children, had more of an adult feel to it.  Rooms are amazing, loved the balcony.   Staff goes above and beyond to accommodate you.  Want to go back...",5,2024,04,01
13,Amazing hotel- Beautiful inside / outside & great location,"The Cotton House Hotel was a favorite of ours on our recent trip to Spain. My husband and I debated between The Cotton House or Hotel Artes and ultimately decided on The Cotton House , despite the fact that the rooms are more ‘boutique’ in style, or small or European in size. We were traveling originally with 3 of our daughters so we booked 3 rooms - one on Marriott points. Our daughters had The Panama room - two twin beds overlooking the courtyard. These rooms are not big by US standards & are pricey- upwards of $500^ per night for the basic room. Our girls were cozy. We saw Americans in the lobby griping about the size of the rooms & frankly it was embarrassing- do your homework. This place is special & lovely. But it’s a European boutique hotel. We were luckily upgraded to The Vichy Suite - a bi level suite with two floors and a beautiful terrace that looks out to Gran Via to Sagrada Familia in the distance. The Cotton House is located in a great location; it’s safe by US standards and you can walk to La Rambla , ( which we don’t care for but our girls do ), and Gotic Quarter within ten minutes or hire a car in seconds. Barcelona Sants is about twenty minutes away and we came from there after our train arrived from Malaga. The BCN International Airport is about 25 minutes away. Upon arrival we were met with a great cava in Waterford crystal & water while we waited in the white beautiful lobby adorned with cotton and white leather to get our room keys. Alejandro then showed us the hotel and had our luggage delivered to our rooms & offered to make any reservations we needed; bring us more espresso pods for our in room espresso maker; ice buckets; or whatever we needed. The hotel has an in house atelier for an ‘experience’ of tailoring, because why not have a custom made shirt made from this historic property where cotton was once made? Each room is beautiful and the stair case is beautiful with marble. We had twice daily maid service with turndown service and the toiletries are special. We dined on property for dinner; dessert and the breakfast both at the restaurant and in our suite; highly recommend for dinner- make a reservation & ask for D’Mitre.",5,2024,03,27
13,5 stars in everyway,"This hotel is absolutley spectacualr. It is a mix of historical and modern that blends flawlessly to a level of elegance that is brethtaking. The staff is excetional as well. Of note is the attention to detail that the staff had each guest.
The location of the hotel is spectacular and makes a trip to Barcelona very accessible to the city.
I cannot say enough good things about our experience!
I would like to mention an extra note to Reyes the bellman on the morning of our departure who went above and beyond to get us to our driver for the trip to the airport.",5,2024,03,24
13,Barcelona stay,"From the moment you walk in from the beautiful decor to the way everyone is so nice you will know you picked a great place to stay.  Thankfully it does not end there.  The restaurant and patio are such great spaces with good food and drink.  The other sitting area are two rooms called the library, like an old formal living room but in cool historical building.   Also the rooftop outdoor space is nice but small.  Rooms and beds are also top notch.  Small balcony overlooking the courtyard if you are lucky.   We definitely would stay again!",5,2024,03,24
13,Very Sweet historic Hotel,"Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Small, typical of larger European cities. Staff were terrific and the restaurant was great. Food was very good and really pretty. The location was very good. Highly recommend slow lunch on the terrace. Nice rooftop lounge area.",4,2024,03,23
13,Ariadna - excellent,The Cotton House has their concierge desk on the 1st floor near the breakfast area - away from the front desk. They were extremely helpful in making suggestions for sightseeing and dining. Ariadna in particular solved a problem that we experienced in a very professional manner.,5,2024,03,21
13,Wonderful Stay.,"When I stayed at the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona. I found the accommodations to be pleasant, the staff was exceptional. Their friendliness and helpfulness ensured that I had a wonderful stay. The hotel is in a great location, and many places of interest are within walking distance.",5,2024,03,20
13,A Mixed Bag - Can't Recommend,"Just spent 2 nights at the Cotton House Hotel.  Frankly, was a bit of a disappointment.  The hotel itself is beautiful...with an excellent design that highlights the building's architecture with modern touches that incorporate sunlight.  The hotel's location is also very good and the rooms and beds were very comfortable.  

The issue is that the hotel management doesn't seem to know which lane to pick for the hotel's identity.  Is it a grand hotel matching the architecture and design and location (next door to the former Ritz)?  Or, is it a ""party"" hotel - hosting DJ's and party guests?   They seem to want to be both - which causes a problem.

We had upgraded to 2 rooms facing the courtyard.  Unfortunately, we were on the 2nd floor and were kept awake late into the morning with loud partiers on the courtyard.  Then, our next door neighbor apparently left the party in the courtyard and came up to his room to continue the party there until after 2AM. I had to walk down to the front desk in my pajamas to complain (as the room phones didn't seem to work).

Also, the service at breakfast each day was like something out of a comedy.  The service was so poor and inattentive that it became amusing.  The waitstaff don't look at you and don't stop by to see how you're doing.  Both days, we had to wait 30 minutes or more to be asked if we want coffee.  Then, when you did order - the order wouldn't come.  And, this isn't a ""European"" thing - there was plenty of waitstaff - they just seemed to be much more concerned about a single unimportant task - such as putting silverware on empty tables.  It was really very, very poor service - the worst we've ever had in Europe.

Finally, the showers in the rooms were very nice - but the floors become very, very slippery when wet - it's a true hazard and there aren't any rubber bath mats provided.

Can't recommend this hotel and we are high-level Marriott members.",3,2024,03,17
13,100/10 - A must-stay for Barcelona,"We LOVED our stay at the Cotton House. The property is stunning, the service is excellent, the bar/restaurant is ideal, and the location is very central to where you want to be if you stay in Barcelona. 

We hesitated initially to book here due to the location and so many sites saying to sya near the water or in the Gothic Quarter. We are SO glad we booked here. The city is very walkable and the location was very easy to access and navigate. We walked all over several neighborhoods and explored with no issues. 

The service was outstanding. I noted in the Marriott app that our flight landed at 7 am and I wanted to check bags before we explored for the day. I have no idea how they were able to accommodate, but they surprised us with a room that was ready for our arrival at 7:30 am. Being able to check in so early and refresh before starting our day set the tone for a wonderful stay. Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and polite. The service was more than we could have expected or asked for. 

I would gladly stay here and recommend this hotel to many friends. Thank you, Cotton House and Marriott!",5,2024,03,04
13,PERFECT BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"This hotel ended up being one of our best travel experiences. We truly could not have asked for anything more. The service was amazing and on point throughout our 4 night stay. Platinum benefits were recognized to the fullest extent. Early checkin and complimentary upgrade were not an issue. Everyone was friendly and went above and beyond to make our stay as memorable as possible. I had researched all the Marriott properties and ended going for a more boutique and less corporate choice and I knew from the very beginning that I made the right decision. Location is centralized. The food at the restaurant is amazing- especially the veal cannelloni and oatmeal. The rooms with balconies facing the courtyard are a comfortable size. The courtyard offers you a peaceful and relaxing environment after a long day of exploring. I would choose it again and again. Thank you to Mery the front desk supervisor, to all those at the concierge, and everyone else. To all the staff- please know you made our stay memorable and we couldn’t have asked for anything more! Keep up the great work- you set an example for all in the hospitality industry to follow!!",5,2024,03,01
13,Perfect location!,"We stayed at the Cotton House for two nights and couldn’t have been happier. The staff was wonderful and accommodating for anything we needed. The location is a five minute walk to Passeig Da Gracias, ten minutes to La Rambla and Plaça Catalunya and 20 minutes to Sagrada Família. In fact you can see the Sagrada from the rooftop terrace. We had a king room that was lovely if a bit on the small size. But it had a terrace and very nice bathroom. We were barely in the room so the size for the two of us was just fine. I would highly recommend.",5,2024,02,23
13,An oasis of luxury in Barcelona,"The Cotton House is an oasis of luxury in the middle of Barcelona. From the moment you arrive, you are warmly greeted and given a tour of this impeccably decorated and beautiful hotel. Our room was spacious, the restaurant beautiful with excellent food and drinks, and the library magnificent. A beautiful outdoor garden area added to the atmosphere and ability to relax in the middle of a busy city.  All of the staff were personable, professional and service oriented. It is immaculate and is centrally located to explore Barcelona. We can't wait to return.",5,2024,02,20
13,Amazing hotel in Bcn,"Suite Damaso is amazing. It’s like a palace. The roof is incredible. The location of the hotel is perfect. Close to the Passeig de Gràcia, plaça de Catalunya, Arc de Triomf and parc de la ciutadella. The staff is always very kind. Special thanks to Beatriz",5,2024,02,18
13,I slept in a Palace! Amazing.,"You can see my other reviews in the past and I never said this but ... this is one of the best hotels I ever stayed. The room was beautiful. No words for ""Suite Damaso"" .. The size , the details , the bed and ... the roof!! Stunning! A special thanks to Beatriz for all the tips and for being so helpful. Will come back for sure.",5,2024,02,18
13,"Impeccable service, gorgeous hotel","We are staying at cotton house this week for five nights. We used the five nights upgrade we had so they gave us the egyptian room on the second floor. The room is on smallish size, on par with most european hotels, but very clean. The room a small balcony with a table and chair facing the courtyard. 
Our flight got in early, hence we got to the hotel around 11am. The front desk lady was so polite, friendly, and eager to be helpful. She got us a room immediately which made our day. Being able to catch some sleep after an overnight flight was a Godsend. 
The breakfast buffet is plentiful and delicious. You can also order from a menu with 3-4 egg options. 
The hotel’s courtyard is an oasis. Lots of greenery, space heaters, and umbrellas. Everyone, from reception, to servers, to bartenders, are friendly and lovely. Will for sure visit again, next time with our kids.",5,2024,02,17
13,Unexpectedly poor,"For what you pay at this hotel, the service is certainly not up to standards. On top of that, when faced by an unexpected event, they absolutely refused to refund the remainder of the originally booked period under the pretext that the policy does not allow it.",2,2024,02,03
13,Nice hotel,"Beautiful hotel. Staff were all great. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony on the sixth floor. Room was a bit small but very nice. Individual thermostats in the room, robes, slippers and bulk shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. The towels were very plush. The food in the restaurant was good as well. The breakfast was good and offered a menu for you to order different egg dishes. We did have drinks in the library and again very good. Only thing is that the Uber does not pick up in front of the hotel. You have to go across the street .location is excellent close to everything.",5,2024,01,23
13,"Perfect stay, unique design hotel, great location, lovely staff!","Loved my stay. Room was great (upgraded to a Madras room from a basic Panama room as a Platinum Elite), perfect for one person. It had everything I needed and was not too cluttered. I especially loved the hardwood floors. Interestingly the shower and toilets were in separate mini “rooms” of their own, and the sink was out in the room. As in you steps out of the shower into the room; so if you are traveling with others you are not this intimate with, it would be uncomfortable! My room faced the street which is perfect for me; I hear there are interior courtyard facing rooms which I’m not sure I would have liked as much. I liked seeing and hearing the street activity, and I didn’t find it too noisy with the windows shut (caveat: I live in NYC). 

I did not take advantage but the library on the first floor was beautiful and spacious. I generally really loved the design of the hotel, it was so unique and not cookie cutter.

I had breakfast at the restaurant numerous days; it was tasty and convenient.

I believe room service is 24 hours with a very limited menu after hours, but I appreciated knowing this was available.

Loved the Ortiga toiletries. I especially loved the house air freshener, also available for purchase for 25€ and conveniently sized at 100ml!

Staff were all lovely and super helpful, especially Mario and Lucia. I used the chat function in the app a lot which was super handy; response time was almost instantaneous. Kudos to whoever was monitoring the chat!

Don’t miss the view from the roof; it was too cold for a swim but not too cold to enjoy the morning sunrise. I wasn’t around for the sunset but I bet it was spectacular too. There is clear view of the Sagrada FAMÍLIA.

I am especially grateful that Mario was able to extend my stay by a night, in the same room, maintaining the same upgrade, when my flight was unexpectedly cancelled right as I was about to leave for the airport. It helped alleviate some of the stress.

Now for the area around the hotel. Don’t miss walking along Carrer de Girona where there are a number of restaurants and cafes, not to mention plentiful benches for resting and people watching! I also found a market - La Concepcio- my last day there, look for it off Carrer di Girona.

Access to metro was easy; I took the metro from the airport and it was easy to navigate using google maps. I pre-purchased the hola Barcelona card and picked it up at a ticket machine at the airport but truthfully I ended up walking around a lot so I probably could have just purchased per ride, but it was nice to have the option to just hop on a bus or metro without worrying about a ticket if I needed to.

All in all, lovely stay in Barcelona and I cannot wait to return!",5,2024,01,05
13,Stay here ,"Perfect. 
Room- very comfortable bed. Clean. Wonderful rain shower and high end toiletries. Booked an Egyptian Room. 

Restaurant-  We had the breakfast package. Wonderful buffet with a speciality item option. The had a green space to sit outside as well. We also had their tree dessert one night. Instagram worthy. 

Staff-
Very attentive. 
Tobias and Olivia at the FD were great. Olivia helped me with my reservation. Tobias was a kind soul. He helped me with all my questions and to find a converter for my electronics

Location- 15 minute walk to all the major spots. Not an overly touristy area but everything you need is within minutes. 

Concierge- Their concierge team known as the Gossypium are amazing. They helped us book all of our activities and dining. Their professionalism is five star. When I checked in, they left me a full package of all my tickets with a personalized letter guiding me on who what where when why. I have been a concierge before and they made me look like a failure. So well done. Lucca was my main go to and was really helpful. They all were but she was the one I saw the most. 

Amenities- they do have a pool but it was to cold being winter. There is also an exercise room. 

Thank you to all the staff for a great visit. ",5,2023,12,31
13,An Extraordinary Hotel,"If you are going to Barcelona and want to make your trip perfect, there's only one way to do it. You must stay at this hotel! The hotel is in a great location, and access to the major sites is a short taxi ride or an easy walk, But this is not the best thing about the hotel. The staff is very helpful; they make you feel like you are the most important guest to stay with them.  You must enjoy the breakfast. My wife describes the buffet as one of the best country club Sunday brunchs, and you can enjoy it every day you are there. Have a drink at the bar (try the cocktail called Pencilin) before sampling the dinner menu. You won't be disappointed. The rooms are quietly decorated, allowing a quiet and peaceful sleep.    ",5,2023,12,03
13,Great experience from beginning to end!,"We enjoyed our stay at Cotton House! The hotel is chic and moody in décor and very interesting architecturally. The beds were very comfortable and quiet. Housekeeping did a great job keeping our room tidy and clean. The best part of staying at the hotel was the staff. Tobias at the Front desk greeted us with a complimentary glass of Cava and made sure we were taken care of. We especially enjoyed visiting the bar and our conversations with bartenders, Lucas and Ramiro. I don't think you could find better staff than at this hotel.",5,2023,11,29
13,A piece of Old Barcelona,"Just as nice as the pictures. Great location. The bar (Vito) and restaurant were fabulous. Room is smallish, shower is funky, but the bed one of the most comfortable ever.  We would consider it again.",4,2023,11,16
13,"Cotton House was was one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at.  Great service, and attention to detail.","Absolutely fantastic!!!!  Service was amazing.  The restaurant was awesome…thanks Deni, Estella, and Sasha thanks for making our dining incredible.   The rooms are amazing.  It’s in the heart of everything, and they take extremely good care of you.  Had a fantastic time there!!!",5,2023,11,08
13,Charming Boutique hotel in great location,"This hotel is stunning. A mid-1800's home converted to Cotton Guild and now a perfect place to stay in Barcelona. The room was spacious, offering comfort and the breakfast was terrific. Staff warm and professional. Location easy walk or short cab ride to all there is to see in a wonderful city.",5,2023,11,06
13,Stunning hotel and impeccable service,"Five star stay at Cotton House! The hotel is gorgeous, the room was well appointed, comfortable and spacious. And the check-in staff was absolutely on point and everyone we interacted with was incredibly professional and engaged. Reyes took great care of us getting our bags up to our room while we were out touring the city and making sure we were in a taxi early the next morning. We enjoyed dinner and breakfast in the restaurant and the service was fantastic. 10/10 recommend. We highly recommend this hotel!",5,2023,11,03
13,Great boutique hotel choice in Barcelona,"Cotton House is a wonderful boutique hotel in central Barcelona, a very short walk to Passeig de Gracia shopping and Gaudi district and the central Placa de Catalunya. It is also only 15 minutes to the Born district and Gothic Quarter.Originally built as the headquarters of the cotton traders' guild at the turn of the 20th century, the restored hotel shows a wonderful attention to detail throughout the public spaces and in the rooms, great staff and a discreet quiet atmosphere throughout. Excellent breakfast buffet served in beautiful 1st floor parlor with a large outdoor terrace. Dont miss the roof terrace with pool and wonderful view of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia.  The actual rooms are a bit small but well designed with comfortable beds and high quality cotton linens and big shower areas.",5,2023,10,25
13,HOLY SMOKES this place is STUNNING!,"My bestie and I were taking a cruise that was porting in Barcelona and we decided to show up a few days early and enjoy this spectacular city.  I arrived a day early and took a taxi (which are super safe and metered in Barcelona) to the hotel after a longg day of travel.  When I arrived to the hotel, I was so brilliantly greeted by the best Bell/Door man Reyes.  He instantly put me at ease with his friendly and joyous nature, taking my bags and walking me into the STUNNING lobby of the Cotton House.  I remember LOUDLY gasping and instantly feeling like I was in a Banana Republic ad!  Feeling transported to a different world, Reyes got me cold water (he offered champagne...but I was saving my liquid calories for the evening!) and queued me up for check-in.  At the front desk, Sol was AWESOME as she explained all the benefits of this magnificent property and shared when my room would be ready.  Reyes stored my bags and I wandered the area around the hotel to find excellent shopping and restaurants all within walking distance.  The location of the Cotton House was perfect!  

When I got to my room, I was so pleased by the amenities, balcony, mini-bar, and shower!  The room is smaller than most Americans are use to, but that is Europe and was just fine for me and my bestie.  We were surprised with how comfortable our two single beds were.  We had great nights of sleep...and as a tall guy (6'2"") I was happy that the beds were long enough that I didn't have to accordion my body to fit.  I explored the rest of the hotel and was sooooooo happy.  It truly is gorgeous.  

The top floor has the gym and pool...which were my only slight letdowns.  The gym is verrrrrry small...but still has weights, an elliptical, and an interactive bike.  I decided to do a cycling class with the bike and it was fun.  But with no air circulation, it got uncomfortable after 40 minutes.  There was free cartons of water and it was very clean which was nice.  The pool area was awesome being on the rooftop with a phone to call for room service and plenty of lounge chairs to relax in.  But the pool was not heated and even though I loved the freezing cold plunge after my biking workout, it was not a place I went back to due to the iceberg water!  Burrrrr!!

The Concierge team was great with recommendations and reservations for dinner (special shoutout to Luca for her help with some places to get great Paella).  

Our favorite part of this hotel was the restaurant.  It is literally stunning and the breakfast experience (buffet) was OFF THE HOOK.  My bestie and I had an early morning tour and we arrived at breakfast and literally were kids in a candy store.  It was presented like artwork and the food was TOP-NOTCH.  How was this a hotel meal???  When you stay here, you MUST experience the breakfast.  We enjoyed some yummy drinks in the evening, as well.  

Overall, this property is absolutely a must stay in a fantastic city.  I 100000% will be back and can't wait to stay a week or longer.",5,2023,10,13
13,Location Location Location…with very good service,"Very good hotel in an excellent location. Walking to many fun locations and taxi service in Barcelona is generally excellent. 
Staff was generally very good. A “hiccup” here and there but these had no impact on our overall stay.
The breakfasts were very good but service at breakfast was just so-so, meh.
One dinner at the hotel was about a 3.5/5.",5,2023,10,12
13,THANK YOU MERY H.,"If you are reading reviews because you want to know how good this property is.  I am still here and I am leaving very soon.  If you are like me, who reads reviews to make a choice on where to stay, let me give you an idea what you will experience on this hotel.  

I would only recommend booking a room with a balcony, you will enjoy it in the morning and in the evening.

If you decided to have breakfast at the hotel choose the buffet and go with the barista made coffee only.

If you have time, go to the TOP FLOOR  you will have a chance to experience the view of the city.

Last but not least, if you are like me, who is OCD, and you want the room to be clean and perfect, this is you perfect place to stay!!!!  The rooms needs some detail work, but not much.

However, all the above will not matter if the hotel doesn't have great customer service.  If you have the chance or NEED to talk to some please ask for MERY H.   She is the supervisor and the best person you  will find to help you, she is very knowledgeable and willing to help you.  I will be back to this hotel next time just BECUSE OF HER.

13,Excellent in every way!,"When I say everything was great, I mean EVERYTHING! The service, the food, the bed, the bath towels and toiletries- all incredible! I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a convenient location to both tourist attractions (Sagrada Familia) and Plaza Santa Maria (think narrow streets with restaurants and shops just like in the movies!)
Javier, the concierge manager, let us purchase a bottle of the hotel’s signature fragrance, and Reyes expertly helped us with our luggage on our way out. Thank you for an amazing stay!",5,2023,10,09
13,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"My wife and I just spent 4 glorious nights and we would actually say the experience got better day by day and it started in such a positive and “PERFECT” level.

Their Staff was absolutely fabulous! From their Front Desk to Restaurant and Bar Staff, Housekeeping and most especially the Concierge Team I tip my hat to each and every one of you. 

Everyone we encountered always went out of their way to make sure we were happy and when we asked for help they made sure we understood and that all our questions answered.

One of the absolute best Hotel Experiences we have ever had. When in Barcelona, we will only stay with you.",5,2023,09,24
13,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"The Cotton House exceeds all my expectations during my stay there. Let’s start with the front staff and how professional they were from the beginning. Offering to handle our bags, pour drinks, and tell us a little more about the hotel. The rooms were out of this world - high class rooms. I couldn’t believe it with my own eyes and how clean it was every day. 

They have people constantly cleaning the hotel day and night. The restaurant can be a little bit on the higher end side but it’s a must go to for lunch. The decor of the hotel is what opened my eyes! They kept a lot of the original prices to this place. I’m a huge fan and shout out to all the staff members who made our stay so enjoyable.",5,2023,09,22
13,Beautiful hotel with amazing service!,"This hotel is in a great location in the Eixample neighborhood of Barcelona. The staff is so attentive and friendly-shout out to Reyes, Mario, and Guido for going above and beyond for us! When we arrived in the morning, our room wasn't ready yet but they set us up with a shower/changing room and gave us towels/water so we could go to the beach-so wonderful! They have cold water and cava for you in the lobby-nice touch!

The breakfast area and sitting rooms are absolutely stunning-so relaxing just to sit there and soak up the ambiance! The pool area is really nice too!  Highly recommend the Cotton House on your next trip to Barcelona!",5,2023,09,10
13,Fantastic hotel and staff!,"We planned to see Barcelona before a 7 night cruise which was upended by Lufthansa Airlines losing our bags in Munich. The airline didn't give a damn and we had little hope of seeing our luggage for the cruise.
My wife and I arrived for our 2 night stay at the Cotton House under terrible stress late on Friday with only the clothes on our backs. The front desk staff was very welcoming, offered us extra toiletries and we had a nice late dinner outside to settle down. 
Our sightseeing trip was now an emergency shopping spree and the hotel couldn't have been more helpful on Saturday in our quest to buy clothes and toiletries for the cruise. Susana, the manager on duty was terrific and both young ladies at the concierge desk were indispensable in helping us locate places to shop. They even tried to help locate our bags. The entire hotel staff was great. Thanks to the help from Cotton House we were able to buy enough clothes and toiletries to get by during our cruise. By the way, the hotel and rooms are beautiful. We ate outside in the courtyard for breakfast and dinner both days. All meals were very enjoyable. Check out the view from the rooftop pool/bar area. It's spectacular. 
Although we arrived at Cotton House under duress and could not really enjoy the hotel or Barcelona, the staff was great in helping us make the best of it. I'm a Marriott Lifetime Titanium, and we got a nice room upgrade, but I suspect everyone would get this level of service. We hope to come back to Barcelona under better circumstances and really enjoy Cotton House.

13,"Great location and design, but not comfortable room and not very good service","As a renovation of a heritage building, the design is absolutely gorgeous! Everything is just on point and very classy taste with not too expensive material. Perfect location for tourists walking around the city, very close to many attractions. 

However, the room size is very limited, and I personally hate the bedding. Topper does not stay in the right place and flat sheet is too small to be wrapped around the mattress, so it went creased all the time. Only two options for pillows, both are too low and too soft. Service was too slow too. We put a cleaning label on the door when we left hotel 10am in the morning, but the room was still not cleaned after we came back to rest 3pm afternoon. Staff was not very attentive either. I was waving my hands to waiters in the restaurant for 5mins trying to get their attention for bill, but they were only focusing on taking to each other. I had to walk to the bar to get the bill in the end, but they were still chatting and making fun of each other while getting my bill.",3,2023,08,30
13,Pleasant stay,"Short visit. Staff were great, interesting building, nice touches like champagne on check in.

Didn’t go in the pool but it looked a bit uninspiring. Rooms could’ve been a bit bette r kept, but were decent and clean enough.

You get one big bottle of water on check in. Would’ve been nice to have a couple of little ones by the bed from turn down, as it’s very hot in the summer and you need a lot of water",4,2023,08,19
13,Entire Stay Outstanding ,"Our visit was spectacular.  The staff was terrific, the hotel was clean and updated and had a lot of historical significance, the food and beverage offerings were outstanding and the location was excellent.  We were traveling with our 5-year old daughter and the staff went out of their way on many occasions to recognize her and engage.  Our car drop and check-in were fast and seamless.  Valet and bellman were fast and attentive, front desk provided early check-in, concierge helpful with great recommendations and assists with access to whatever we wanted to do.  Can't say enough about Reyes and his bell/valet team.  When we needed things out of our car, he handled quickly.  When we needed our car it was there in a flash and when we checked out, he walked us to our car in the car park and loaded all the luggage, snapped in her car seat and fastened our daughter in with the seat belt.  Above and beyond!  What more could we ask for?  It was a great experience and the pool was a great feature late afternoon. *****",5,2023,08,15
13,"Elegant, Historical and Chic","Beautiful residence to enjoy a trip to Barça.  Terrific location, quiet but central.  The staff is friendly, attentive and kind.  Have a chat with Reyes, the star of the front.  His smile started and ended our stay with warmth!  The history of the building is fascinating.  Those who are architecture and history buffs will love having their down time here.  It’s a spectacular property especially for a Marriott.  The smallest rooms are small but gorgeous and have very little light, so make sure to check before booking to ensure you’ve found what you need.  Don’t miss the rear garden terrace for drinks and lunch.  The art on the walls is beautiful and unique, it’s a shame to let your stay go by without admiring it all.  All in all a 5 out of 5 and we will stay there again if we can.",5,2023,08,06

They were able to accommodate my request for an early arrival check-in, and the room was exactly as represented, and maybe slightly better!  We had a terrace room overlooking the courtyard, which was extremely quiet at night. The air conditioning worked like a Polar blast in the summer heat. The bed linens and towels lived up to the Cotton House textile history and reputation. Housekeeping provided nightly turn down service with chocolate on the pillow. Nice touch!

Luis and Reyes were friendly and helpful on check in and check out.

Experience. They wouldn’t let us check in as we decided to bring our little child with us last minute and they wouldn’t let us check in even though we did not require a larger bed or a roll away. Literally turned us away and wouldn’t refund us. Very sad to have had a second experience at the hotel be so horrific and hopefully you all take this boutique bad experience into consideration.

Charming lobby.  Nice staff but wow, horribly small rooms.  And at $1000 a night.  Ritz next door is a much better choice.

Hard to reconcile that price with the small closet plus the very weird toilet (toilet in one room, shower in another room, sink in the hallway).   Who ever heard of that??

Like I said, come for a drink, get the “romance” of the “historic building” and stay at the Ritz or villa magna. They have closets!",1,2023,06,21

Probably the highlight of the service we received was from the concierge named “Reyes”, who was a consummate professional from checkin to checkout.",5,2023,05,17
13,Fabulous hotel ,"Fabulous hotel all around.  Beautiful, comfortable, serene and so much more.   Only had 3 nights there and could have stayed a month!  The breakfast buffet and terrace as well as the quaint sitting rooms and location is spectacular.   The staff was very pleasant and knowledgeable and mostly accommodating.   We are gold members/Amex fine hotels and weee upgraded to a nice room.  The only negative is that we had to wait from 7 am - 11 am upon arrival for our room to be ready after a red eye flight with no sleep, we were miserable hanging out with others in the lounge area until we could lay down and rest!  Cleaning staff doesn’t arrive until 8 and our room was vacant but apparently took 3 hours to clean! 🥱  ",5,2023,05,13
13,Not What we Expected,"Lovely hotel but missing 5 Star features.   Breakfasts in garden were exceptional except for being understaffed.   Head waiter was overworked and extremely busy.  He seemed to be doing all the jobs.
  
Unusual for a European Hotel, especially a 5 star,  to not have a bidet in a small toilet area.  There was an extremely large shower and tub area but non skid mats are needed since entire area is one big shower and very slippery. Also water in sink did not drain out .  While brushing your teeth or washing your hands, the sink filled with water.

  Highlight and greatest credit to this hotel was the bellman named Alex.  He seemed to handle a multitude of requests and did so always with a smile.  He was always around and looking for ways to help such as handing us umbrellas when there was a slight drizzle outside.  He anticipated all our needs.  We found this to be so unusual for a bellman but so much appreciated.  Alex is a true credit to this hotel and we missed him when he had days off especially on our day of departure.  Our taxi arrived early in the morning to take us to the airport.  We were well on our way when our driver received a phone call from the bellman on duty. (not Alex).  He told the driver that we left a bag behind.  I was sure we had all our bags but didn't want to take a chance so we turned around and returned to hotel only to find out that it was not our bag.  This cost us added expense and time so our driver had to really rush to get us to airport on time.  Had the bellman checked everyones baggage tags before loading bags into the taxi, this mishap could have been prevented. The bag in question was a personal carry on that was sitting in the lobby area.

  We used a large amount of Bonvoy points for this stay since we wanted a 5 Star experience.  Unfortunately, this hotel did not meet with our expectations and we could have used half the amount of our Bonvoy points and stayed elsewhere.  ",5,2023,05,09
13,"Great hotel, great service!","We stayed here pre cruise.  The location is great for sightseeing and shopping.  All within 20-40 minutes walk.  Staff are friendly and polite.  Especially Reyes who handled our luggage, Martha and Jill in reception.  They always give you sunny smiles.",5,2023,05,07
13,Great Hotel!!,My wife and I have stayed in some very nice hotels and this one rates with the best of them.  Every experience from the greeting by Alex at the door with champagne and water to the departure arranged by Reyes.  Super friendly and helpful staff.  Great concierge team.  Wonderful restaurant.  Because of our Bonvoy status we were upgraded to a slightly larger room. (which by the way is still small).  The rooms are very comfortable.  Had a great view over the front of the hotel.  Very comfortable bed and were treated to champagne and some chocolates to celebrate our anniversary.  The restaurant patio is very pretty and pleasant to sit at and enjoy some tapas as we did.  We had just arrived by train from Madrid and we were hungry.  The tapas was excellent.  There is literally not one public space in the hotel which is not super inviting and welcoming.  I am not one to sit in a hotel lobby or lounge but in this hotel you have to.  It is calling your name.  Even the guests become more friendly and chatty because you feel like you are sitting in some ones home. (a very nice home).  The only issue we had was that we asked the hotel to arrange a cab to take us to the port.  The bellman told me it would be no more that $20.  Well its my fault for not looking but the driver never turned the meter on and told me it was $55.  I would think the hotel would have a trusting car service or group of cabs they use.  When i ask for you to arrange a car to take me to the port i would have expected you to arrange something reliable and honest especially at a hotel of this caliber.   Other than that I cant say enough great stuff about this hotel,5,2023,05,04
13,First Class Experience ,"Elegant hotel with extremely helpful and professional staff that helped us with several detailed recommendations and reservations.  While the hotel was on a somewhat busy street our room overlooked a lovley courtyard and was very peaceful.   Take time to explore the historic and stunning puplic spaces along with the  lovel restaurant and bar that had very friendly service.  This was a first class experience from check in to check out.  Thank you!

13,Excellent service and great location!,The staff at Cotton House made our week long stay in Barcelona a most pleasurable experience. Service by people like Reyes was outstanding! We thought the restaurant food was fantastic as well. We walked to a good number of sights we wanted to take in. Great stay -- thanks Cotton House staff!,5,2023,04,22
13,Cotton house -Barcelona's best,There is a great reason that this is Barcelona's #1 hotel--truly exception from the champagne check-in to the superb staff.Location is perfect and this Autograph Cotton house is authentic in every detail.,5,2023,04,19
13,STAY HERE!,The Cotton House is a beautiful boutique hotel perfectly situated within Barcelona’s most walkable neighborhoods. Its rooms are generously-sized. Beds are extremely comfortable. The staff are exceptional  and transform every-day amenities like breakfast buffets into rich experiences that surpass other hotels. The rooftop deck has phenomenal views and service. The pool tho isn’t heated. Great hotel. Will be back. ,5,2023,04,15
13,"Beautiful, elegant hotel with great service.","From servers at breakfast, to the front desk, the concierge the bell boy and housekeeping, everyone was 5* in service. Breakfast was delicious and is served in a beautiful room. The guest rooms were small but well furnished, comfortable beds, lovely showers, and my daughters ordered room service and loved it. Can’t recommend highly enough if you are staying in Barcelona.",5,2023,04,06
13,Great experience,"A wonderful experience.   Hotel personnel are professional, helpful and friendly.  From the time you arrive until you depart you feel welcome.   Great location making it convenient to walk to many nice restaurants and for sightseeing.   The breakfast is outstanding.   I have visited Barcelona over 20 times and very happy to have found this property.   We enjoyed it much more than even some of the top 5 star properties in the city.  It rates an “A”.   ",5,2023,04,01
13,"I am a tough hotel critic, but this hotel was PERFECT","This hotel was perfect for my husband and I, in fact it was so perfect, that everyone we met in the lobby was just like us from another part of the US.  We wanted a comfortable, well-located hotel and the Cotton House was perfect.  The staff was so amazing.  They were so helpful, so knowledgeable, always ready with a map and a pen to draw where you needed to go.  The rooms are small but efficient, what you expect in Europe.  We had a cute balcony.  The rooftop pool and deck were wonderful.  Great hotel",5,2023,03,29
13,A costly mistake,"I had hoped to show my teenage daughter a pleasant time, but Cotton House was a poor choice.  It took three turns at the front desk to get our key. On the third wait there was one front desk employee and a long line, when I finally got to the front a man sidled up and was assisted first. This experience of being overlooked would be a common thread of our three days. The suite did not a have a full compliment of toileteries. When you depend on a hotel to offer a mini moisturizer and your discover at midnight that they  don't, it makes a difference. In our nonsmoking room a cigarette was left on the balconette. There was no do not disturb/make up the room card. The bath tub was not clean when we arrived. I cleaned it myself so my daughter didn't notice. The first night we ordered room service and got one setting of silverware. The room service glassware was left in the room all three nights of our stay (and the cigarette stayed on the balconette). On the last night we thought to have a dessert in the restaurant after an evening  but our wait to be seated ended when an employee finally showed up and attended to a party that had just arrived while we waited. Returning to a room that was not clean was the coup de grace. What a disappointment and a despicable way to treat guests . Attached a view from the door of our suite, we paid a premium to sleep a step from the elevator bank.",2,2023,03,21
13,"Stylish, Comfortable stay. If you're on the fence book it!","We stayed at the Cotton House in Barcelona for the first 3 days of our trip and enjoyed it so much we stayed one additional night upon our return to Barcelona before departing for home yesterday, instead of booking elsewhere and leaving it to chance. 

Everything about our stay was excellent. We arrived late into the evening and the front desk staff was warm, welcoming and extremely helpful. Alex, Julia and Jill greeted us upon arrival with genuine kindness and enthusiasm, graciously welcomed us with a glass of bubbles and assisted with bags for our family of 5 without being asked and without hesitation. Though this seems common sense, I have stayed in countless ""luxury hotels"" where this is NOT the case and after traveling 15 hours to arrive at the hotel the last thing anyone wants to do is have to convince a doorman to help with bags. 

Throughout the stay Mona was always smiling, engaging and friendly and constantly helped us with anything we needed. The concierge desk helped us get train tickets booked. Every aspect of our stay was excellent but the front desk staff was what elevated our stay above the level of service at similar level hotels. Though every we encountered was great- Julia, Alex, Mona and Jill set the Cotton House above the rest and truly raise the bar for kind, genuine helpful, customer service. We have stayed in numerous luxury hotels in many countries and initially was torn between Cotton House and El Palace after reading reviews that CH was more of a 4 star compared to neighboring luxury hotels. While we did enjoy piano and cocktails next door at El Palace, we were extremely happy with our choice to book at Cotton House. Cotton House oozes style, ambiance, aesthetic and charm with lots of historic character without feeling ""dated"" or pretentious. The first floor restaurant and sitting rooms are darling and were our go to meeting spot in between sightseeing. The breakfast options were plentiful and our teenagers ranging 15-20 loved the Cotton House waffles and give the hotel an A+ review from their perspective as well. Nespresso machines in rooms, additional pods available upon request, complimentary water bottles, and nice toiletries in pretty packaging as well. 

We had 2 rooms booked, we were give Platinum Elite upgrades and ended up in (Cotton Room, and Egyptian Room). We were celebrating a 16th birthday in one room and a 50th birthday in another, I emailed ahead to inform the hotel of the special occasion and they decorated each room with balloons and had a dessert, cute card and a split of wine in the room upon arrival. I did have to call and request fresh towels and toiletry replenishment but each time we asked for something we received it without delay.  Location is central and most major neighborhoods are a 15 minute walk. Cabs for larger groups (above 4) can be hard to get but you can hail 2 cabs or the hotel was great about calling and ordering us vans that fit 5 anytime we asked. Stylish, comfortable stay! Please note, 3rd bed can only be added to certain rooms (such as Egyptian).",5,2023,02,24
13,Worth the visit - fantastic staff. All very good English speakers,This is a beautiful hotel. I would highly recommend staying here. The staff is excellent. Alex at the door was extremely helpful as were both Javier’s at the concierge desk. We had a lovely room overlooking the courtyard. The hotel is well located within walking distance of 10-15minutes of most major sites.,5,2023,02,23
13,Something’s missing,"Stayed one night at hotel and had dinner there.  The rooms fairly small, take largest room. The hotel lobby and restaurant is beautiful.   The bar is warm and gorgeous.  Something missing tho. The room is cold looking, the food ordinary. Granted it was January and very quiet      Staff was nice",3,2023,01,29
13,A perfect stay.,"My husband and I spent a fabulous weekend here, and we plan on recommending it to many of our friends. It was absolutely beautiful. Special thanks to Alex, Reyes, Nabil, and Ricardo. Everyone who helped us was so kind, warm, and welcoming. The property itself was spectacular, comfortable, and special. We will definitely be returning!",5,2023,01,17
13,Avoid at all costs. ,"WARNING: My laptop was stolen from our room.  The door was never left open and we never removed the laptop from the room ourselves.  The laptop was then wiped.  The hotel claims not to know anything about it.  I have gotten the Ambassador team involved and that hasn't helped either.  We travel often and to many countries and this has never happened to us before.  It is extraordinarily frustrating. 

Aside from that, even before the laptop went missing, we decided to check out early.  There was a lot of street noise at night - the hotel was unhappy about it and charged us an extra night.  Housekeeping did a poor job of replacing amenities and the towels, robes, and sheets were very very well-worn and almost bare in some areas.  For the price, it was very disappointing.  

The common areas are beautiful, as is the breakfast area.  But the rooms (even the 'upgraded ones') left much to be desired.  They really needed renovation.  The beds had these odd mattress covers on them, probably because of the condition of the mattresses.  I honestly didn't want to investigate too much further.  ",2,2023,01,13
13,Wonderful place,The terrace of the restaurant is amazing. It’s so nicely decorated / furnished. Try to get a table there. The building / rooms are in general wonderful. This is a very good place for special occasions. The food is very good and the service is outstanding.,5,2023,01,12
13,Great Hotel & Outstanding Stay!,"This is a newer hotel in the Autograph Collection.  Small and intimate and amazing old building which was actually cotton house--the interior architecture is amazing and worth a visit to the bar to view if you do not stay here.  Location of hotel is outstanding especially if you are doing the main attractions.  Everything within a short taxi ride or a nice walk

Staff overall was outstanding.  Front deck and concierge were amazing and could not help you enough.  I cannot say enough about the concierge and the front desk staff—helpful, enthusiastic, interested and customer oriented.

Rooms on small size but efficiently organized—almost to the point of being a bit stark.  We up graded to a room higher up and were pleased.  Thermostat in room was unsat—had to have a tutorial to figure it out especially moving from air con to heat or vice versa.  First couple of days, we had to call down to front deck to have them adjust the temperature from their location which they can do.  Thermostat is just too complicated for a hotel room--GM should consider a different option.

Breakfast buffet was good but not great compared to other similar price-range hotels we had stayed at in Europe. I was disappointed and felt it was a bit on the cheap side that you had to pay an upcharge to get a cooked entrée including eggs, waffles or pancakes—and none of these were available on the buffet.  The buffet was more of a continental  breakfast.  We were at the Lisbon Ivens Autograph Collection in October, new in last two years, and no comparison with the breakfast.  When you are paying the rates we pay, I simply expect better on the breakfast.  Management needs to look at this.

Restaurant-bar we simply loved.  One of nicest we have experienced.  Beautiful library area, large beautiful dining area with a lovely outside courtyard dining area—lots of options—very special place for a drink, to relax for a few hours, or to get some tapas or meals.  Great place to have a drink and relax.  The Tapa menu is available all day and we had lunch there several times and food was excellent.

Finally, this is obviously a very well run hotel and the staff are trained for customer service.  Well done by management. 

Overall a fantastic stay at great hotel.

13,Excellent location and bedding,"To be honestly the bedding at here super comfortable nice and clean. The location is very convenient you can walk to all the hi light. The restaurant is very nice all the foods are high quality. Staff are friendly and helpful. I don’t like one thing the room is very small and the bathroom does not have an exhaust fan, spring door. It will always be blacked out.  no ventilation  The bathroom cannot be dried.",5,2022,12,15
13,First class stay in Central Barcelona,Beautifully restored classic structure. Very well located. We enjoyed a comfortable room with an extra large double bed with a balcony overlooking the courtyard. The first floor’s magnificent library and lounge is a highlight. Rooftop exercise pool with a view toward the Sagrada Familia is a nice touch. Welcoming and accommodating staff.,5,2022,11,20
13,VERY NICE BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"Stayed here 4 nights.  Charming historical building; super location; excellent staff; nice public spaces; excellent bar and breakfast dining room.  Room was well appointed.  Only issue was (apparently) insufficient housekeeping staff.  On two occasions, our room was not cleaned.  Explanation was that the housekeepers were consumed by cleaning vacated rooms for new guests and ran out of time before their shift ended.  That needs to get fixed!",4,2022,11,17
13,Great choice,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Cotton House. Not only is the location ideal, the hotel is beautiful and a very significant old building. The rooms are large and very comfortable with the best beds. Reception made us feel welcome as soon as we stepped in the door. Our room was ready and Reyes gave us a brief tour and history. He is delightful and always greeted us with a smile.  I would return and stay  for an extended period because I fell in love with Barcelona in general. Thank you to everyone at Cotton House, you made our stay enjoyable.",5,2022,11,09
13,Amazing Stay,"We recently stayed at the Cotton House for 3 nights.  The service from the minute we arrived till the minute we left for the airport was consistently wonderful.  We had a higher-than-usual vehicle and the valet team went out of their way to find a place to park the car.  All the small touches throughout our stay were thoughtful.

We had a back room with a balcony and it was lovely to have a drink there as the sun set.  The beds were comfortable, super quiet room too.

Special shoutout to Rajdeep and Reyes who provided exceptional services!  We appreciate you!",5,2022,11,07
13,Great Stays,"From our family to the Cotton House family, we just want to say thank you for all your great hospitality, help, friendliness and caring.  Both of our stays over the last couple of months were great, and we could not recommend staying at this hotel more.  The property and location are wonderful, but truly the staff stood out and made our stays exceptional.  We feel like we have a new home and new friends in Barcelona, all right there at the Cotton House.  Froggy obviously feels the same way.  We look forward to returning some day.  Thanks.",5,2022,11,04
13,Wonderful hotel,"Enjoyed our 3 night stay very much. The location is central but away from the most busy/noisy areas. Easily accessible from the airport - 20 euro using the Cabify app. The building is beautiful and make sure to check out the rooftop view. We stayed in an upgraded Egyptian room which was quiet, comfortable and had a huge shower. The bed and bedding were divine. The highlight of the hotel is the staff, especially the concierge service. They were super helpful with recommending restaurants and making reservations (although they can't do miracles so make sure to reserve your sagrada familia tickets a week ahead). Another big plus was a wonderful terrace restaurant. We had breakfast there on our last day and it was wonderful (just make sure to clarify what is included in Batuar vs Cotton breakfast - there are two printed menus with conflicting information). The hotel is part of the Marriott network.",5,2022,11,02
13,Unlikely to repeat,"This is the fourth Marriott property I have stayed at in Barcelona, and the one I am least likely to repeat. If you want to be in the middle of all the touristy stuff the Meridian offers better value and better location. If you do not mind staying at the beach, my first choice would be Arts, then W. The location on a major road is not great. I am still trying to figure out what this Autograph brand stands for. I would definitely not rate the hotel 5 stars. When I arrived I was not offered any help with luggage (nor when I was leaving). Normally I could not care less, but this time I was traveling with two suitcases due to an extended trip.  I stayed in ""Cotton Room"". Nice room with a small balcony. While I could see over the rooftops, the courtyards are nothing to get excited about - lot of laundry handing on balconies. To me it seems this property is similar to the Meridian in a sense it has been been a hotel before, so the renovation is really a facelift. Otherwise who would put an awkward bathtub instead of a walk-in shower into a hotel room today? I paid my stay with points, which was the reason for choosing this hotel. I would have never paid the asking rate for the room. ",3,2022,10,31
13,Not a 5 star property,"We stayed one night following a cruise.  Ironically we stayed next door preceding our cruise and that other property truly IS a 5 star.
In both places we reserved junior suites.  At this property the bathroom is very small, there is a simple closet, the bedroom is small and the adjoining living room is a bit larger but not special.  In the other property in a junior suite we had a large bathroom, large, walk in closet, large bedroom and larger living room.  Another difference:  there was a small split of wine and two chocolates to welcome us at Cotton House - next door was a bouquet of fresh flowers, chilled cava in an ice bucket, and beautiful chocolates.  Another stark difference was the level of service.  It just wasn’t here with the exception of Reyes, the head bellman.  The front desk never offered an orientation to the property.  Our suite was not ready at check in and we were never offered coffee or anything else.  We went to the ‘restaurant’ for some and getting the attention of anyone to ask for some was difficult to say the least.  For another cup we had to physically go in search of someone and then had to ask a second time because they’d forgotten.  
Our stay was salvaged by the dj who mixed some great music in the evening on the patio, where we enjoyed a bottle of wine, tapas and then dinner.   The food is outstanding.  The service?  Not so much - perhaps they are short handed?
The library area is lovely but if you want to sit there you cannot have a beverage we were told.  
This was one night only and so it was fine.  However we will return to Barcelona for another cruise in the future and it will not be to this hotel.  We’d rather go back next door where the service matched the accommodation and the level we expected.",3,2022,10,28
13,What a find….,"After much research we finalized our 3 nights here after our cruise. Using our Marriott app and TripAdvisor made it almost seamless. Rooms are smaller than our U S  expectations but very well attended. We were upgraded to a room overlooking the patio dining and were not disappointed with the location. Belle at the front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating and the mature bellman jumped at our every request.Hotel is classy and elegant in a very central part of town, Bring your walking shoes if you choose to walk as it’s still a little jaunt to most sites. Brunch every morning on site is exceptional and an event on its own and quite a treat. Please be aware of petty theft and pick pockets in all of Spain as it is nothing short of organized crime. We dodged one close call because we were warned and had our guard up. Don’t be scared just be aware. Felt safe the entire time here. Spend sometime at the market to see another side of life. About  15-20 from airport.",5,2022,10,28
13,Beautiful hotel; a few flaws,"I stayed here for 6 nights in Oct 2022. The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. The restaurant is excellent and the restaurant team is incredible. Definitely take advantage of that. The reason I'm only giving this hotel 3 stars is the housekeeping service and the pool. 

Housekeeping: the service was average, at best. We had to repeatedly ask for things to be done (towels replaced, dirty cups removed, etc). When the room was made up, we would come back to find clean towels left on top of our luggage (??), bathrobes still left on the back of the chair (not hung up), dirty cups in the bathroom even though we specifically asked to have them replaced. Really basic stuff. Also our room didn't have a bottle opener, which was supposed to be there, so we called housekeeping two times and they kept telling us they'd bring one and they never did. We finally just took our bottles down to the restaurant where they happily helped us. The housekeeping at this 5 star hotel is 3 star level. 

The pool is tiny and sad. 

The front desk team was lovely. The hotel smells incredible (we tried to buy the candle but they were out). 

If you care about housekeeping and having your room attended to or a good pool, consider that when booking. If you care about location, a beautiful hotel, yummy beautiful restaurant and kind staff, I say book this hotel.",3,2022,10,26
13,Great Historic Hotel,"This was our last stop on our honeymoon and we had a comfortable stay. We arrived early and we got luck with our room being available. The bellman was very knowledgeable about the hotel's history and very friendly. The Concierge recommended some great restaurants and she was great with describing the vibes of each restaurant as well. The bar staff at night was fun! The only thing I would say was the front desk friendly but could tell them was some miscommunication on things. We were told that we had breakfast included and then when we went up for breakfast on our last morning, they said it wasn't included after we ate at the buffet. I had toast and a hard boil egg for approximately $32. When I brought it up to the front desk about what we were told at check in and what happened, she just said ""yes, it is not included."" We would not have eaten that morning if we knew that ahead of time. Other than that, the rooms we beautiful and comfortable.",4,2022,10,19
13,Visit to Cotton House Hotel,"Overall, we had a wonderful visit. I'll start with the cons. I used points and paid for upgrades from there. Our room was not as nice as I had expected it would be. There were stains on the bathroom walls, the toilet ran (it needs to be fixed)  and for some reason housekeeping came extremely late (5:30 pm) We couldn't get our room cleaned one night because we were just back from a long day touring so opted to just get some new towels. That just seems really late to get a room cleaned. Was it because I used points? Now pros...restaurant was wonderful, front desk staff was wonderful and special shout out to concierge Sara. She was absolutely incredible. We are vegetarian and she got us reservations for two dinners that were superb. Also, it was our wedding anniversary and we really were impressed with the restaurants. Thank you Sara! Location is also in a very central location for getting around and we were able to walk to a lot of locations. Overall, good but could have been a bit better with the room itself.",4,2022,10,18
13,Beautiful property in perfect location,"We spent four nights here and were completely glad we did.  For us, the location is literally perfect -- right at the epicenter of everything one might want to do and walkable to everything. The staff was lovely and the breakfast spread very generous.  Our room had plenty of room and (while it was probably overdue for a deep cleaning), the bed, the linens, and the shower were all great.  We overlooked the courtyard which means we didn't even hear the traffic of the main road.  If we return to Barcelona, we'll certainly choose the Cotton House Hotel again.",5,2022,10,14
13,Beautiful boutique hotel,"The decor or this hotel is unusual and very sophisticated. The service was friendly; everyone recognized us and greeted us daily. Reyes was especially helpful with our car and any other needs and questions. Checkin was friendly, quick and smooth. The man that helped us with our bags and served us champagne was wonderful. The restaurant has a beautiful outdoor dining area that we greatly enjoyed for dinner with wonderful food and service. I highly recommend this hotel!",5,2022,10,11
13,Amazing Hotel in Barcelona!,"We stayed at the Cotton House while we were on our honeymoon in Barcelona.  The hotel is gorgeous and extremely clean!  The rooftop pool was amazing as well.  We told the concierge that we were on our honeymoon and they sent up a bottle of wine and a dessert.  The staff were all extremely friendly.  We had breakfast every day at the hotel and it was very good.  The hotel also had a nice bar.  Lastly, the hotel was very centrally located to many attractions and restaurants.  We would highly recommend the Cotton House and will definitely stay here again if we're in Barcelona!",5,2022,10,09
13,Great vibe and good cocktails,"Great Graet atmosphere in the restaurant. I went there with my family nad we had dinner at the CottonHouse. The food was good but many things on menu were not available. The cocktails were very good and the bartenderd can get you everything off the menu.

However if you are looking for the cozy, modern, beautiful mid 19. century vibe where you can take the best pictures this restaurant is the nice. Great experience",4,2022,10,09
13,Beautiful Property Centrally Located,"We stayed at this wonderful property for 5 nights while staying in Barcelona on a recent Vacation. We stayed in the Cotton King Room and were given a room on the top floor facing the courtyard overlooking the cafe. The room was nice and quiet even though on a busy street. Staff was amazing and always very helpful. The hotel is very centrally located and within walking distance of popular neighborhoods such as the gothic quarter and La Barceloneta, as well as popular attractions such as La Sagrada Familia and Parc Güell if you like walking. There is also easy access to the Metro. The Cafe on the second floor has a beautiful patio that makes you forget you’re in the middle of a large city. Cold breakfast buffet was included as a benefit choice with our stay as Bonvoy Platinum members, as well as the choice of points or a welcome drink. The breakfast was delicious but only ate at the hotel once due to wanting to explore the city. There are several sitting rooms including a beautiful library on the second floor where you can relax. There is also a small pool on the top floor with stunning views overlooking the city to the north. This upscale hotel is an excellent choice if looking for a relaxing quiet hotel that is centrally located. 10/10 would stay again.",5,2022,10,05
13,"Perfect location, helpful staff, breakfast, room, amenities…","The Cotton House is in a convenient, immaculate, central & safe part of Barcelona near subway stops.  The restaurant, buffet breakfast, bar, terrace & concierge are on 1.  The fitness center, Pool & rooftop bar on six.  The cozy pool had 6 chaises along with tables & chairs.  The fitness room had 2 cardio machines & some free weights.  arrangements can be made at a more extensive gym.  

 This historical, boutique hotel from the 1800's has 83 rooms, formerly the headquarters of the Association of Cotton & Textiles.  There were cotton touches throughout the charming hotel.  The 'House of Cotton' has been a  landmark; as the hotel after an extensive 2005 restoration & refurbishment.

We were given a deluxe madras room on the fifth floor. The room is bright, Plush and very comfortable. We have a king bed with luxurious linens & toiletries, refrigerator filled with bottled water, a safe, Nespresso machine, Electric teapot, plush robes and slippers, lots of closet space and plenty of room to open up our luggage.  The toilet, tub and shower are in separate rooms off the sink & dressing area, making it ideal to share for five days.  

Breakfast every morning was included, we enjoyed cappuccinos, warm fresh pastries & cakes, meats & cheeses, fresh juices, platters of fresh fruits, sandwiches, yogurts .... The terrace & different dining rooms were bright & beautiful, service was impeccable.

Housekeeping went out of their way to make us comfortable. Ariadne and Javier, the concierges was extremely helpful. They recommended the app Fork which is the European version of Yelp & Open Table, transportation & venues.  We choose the Marriott brand because of the knowledgeable and helpful concierge that helps us navigate the city safely & efficiently.",5,2022,09,29
13,Cotton House is the best of the best.,"From the  wonderful staff at reception, Reyes who is clearly the historian of the house, and the fabulous staff in Batuar, the service at the Cotton House could not have been better. The Cotton House exudes an old world charm, from the uniforms that the entire staff wear, to the library, and the ornate staircases, you feel like an aristocrat in the early 1900's. 

We arrived at 3pm and our upgraded room was ready. We had booked a basic Panama room, but my wife called the day before check in and let them know it was my 50th birthday. We arrived upgraded to a very spacious main level Cotton room with an outdoor terrace, on the same floor as the bar/restaurant. It was so comfortable, and with late checkout on our departure day, we almost refused to leave. 

We ate/drank at Batuar every day of the stay. The food was fantastic, the look of the restaurant was very old world European, and the service was excellent. Polite and friendly, not stuffy.

It was a perfect 3 day stay to begin our 11 day trip to Spain. Thank you to everyone at Cotton House for making my birthday trip so special.",5,2022,09,27
13,Beautiful hotel and Reyes is lovely!,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights with my friends earlier this year. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. The restaurant and back patio are breath taking! The hotel has small touches that absolutely stand out. Reyes is one of the best parts of the hotel! He made us feel safe in the lobby and on the street outside of the hotel. He was very warm and lovely, making it a nice experience when we first arrived and each time we returned to the hotel. I hope everyone is able to meet him!",5,2022,09,18
13,Great location and charming hotel!,The hotel is beautiful and in an amazing location! The food in the hotel is excellent and so is the staff! I would say only downfall is the bell hops. I told them the address even showed the website of the museum and he told the taxi driver the wrong address so we had to take 2 taxis 🤣🤣 ! The room was nice we had a beautiful balcony which was nice at night to relax on ! One last thing I am a platinum member and there was no upgrade! Which I was surprised about but I get they were fully booked!,4,2022,09,17
13,Well appointed and comfortable with the excellent service.,"This is a great hotel, the staff is super friendly and helpful and we were very comfortable staying here for 2 nights. 

We stayed in a Cotton room and it had a courtyard view. Yes, the room is small but when you’re in Europe hotel rooms are not going to be enormous! I found the size of the room comfortable for 2 people and our 2 large suitcases and various smaller bags. 

We did get the chance the check out pool on the top floor but didn’t go swimming. The pool area is nice and wasn’t super busy at the time. The pool isn’t large but a good size for cooling down and hanging out. 

The hotel itself is decently located and we walked to many places with ease. On occasion we took taxis as well and that was also never too far of a drive from the major touristic sites in Barcelona.",5,2022,09,07
13,Favorite hotel in Spain,"We stayed at the Cotton House on the recommendation of a friend who's in the hospitality industry in Catalonia and it did not disappoint. The facility itself is gorgeous--wood paneling and beautiful decor throughout. We ate breakfast and a dinner at the outdoor restaurant, which was fantastic. And the location is great--very close to most everything and the concierge got us tickets to the Sagrada Familia and Casa Batllo. Will definitely stay at the Cotton House again the next time we're in Barcelona. ",5,2022,09,05
13,Truly lovely hotel in an excellent location.,"We loved our experience in this hotel. It is beautiful at every turn. You are inundated with charm at this place! We stayed in a larger Egyptian room, and it was spacious and full of high end details and amenities. The breakfast is really wonderful, especially when you can dine out on the patio. The rooftop pool area is very small, but it makes for a nice break between activities and it offers stunning views of the city. The reception staff were remarkably welcoming and the service was very friendly throughout our stay. The location is nice, too, because you are a bit removed from the overly touristy Ramblas, but still a very close walk to it. You are also close to the metro station and it's easy to get taxis to where ever you wish to go. 

Ok, so there are a few minor downsides. The gym is laughably small. Don't count on using it if you are a grown person who actually likes to work out. There are plenty of gyms in the area to go to (you'll have to buy a day pass for them, of course). The rooftop pool should be adults-only - it's quite small and not set up for kids at all and unfortunately parents desperate to entertain their children on vacation, let them take it over and ruin the ambience for everyone else.  This happened only once while we were there, but just don't count on it being a calm, relaxing place to get a drink and take a dip. Finally, you kind of have to track housekeeping down to clean your room if you weren't ready for it the first time the housekeeper passes by. Having said that, they seem very happy to clean it once you let them know.",5,2022,08,28
13,"Nice hotel, terrible service!","This hotel is definitely not a 5 star at all. My husband and I travel all over the world, and have stayed in 5 star hotels 90% at the time, and this hotel is definitely by far not anywhere near other 5 star hotels out there. For the amount of money you pay, it's a complete ripped off that you wanna vomit! and here's why.
Sure, I'll give the overall esthetic of the common areas of the hotel a 5 star. It is very unique, lovely, and the history of the building is special. The rooms are 3 star, It is very small. Nothing in the room is grand, shower is basic, toilet is basic, everything is basic. A very underwhelming overall ambiance of the room is definitely not worth your money (you can get better accommodation on other hotels).
The service is 1 star, garbage service. The restaurant staff takes forever to take your order (1 hour minimum) and once you've ordered your food you will never see them again, even if there is no other customer eating. The room service is almost non-existent. We called literally 10 times for the so called ""24 hour room service"" but no one picks up the phone. We called front desk 3 times to tell them that no one is picking up in room service, and on the 3rd time the front desk person had to looked for kitchen staff (and this is in the middle of the day). Another incident where we called front desk to ask for housekeeping supplies and the supplies never came (we waited 2 hrs, thinking they might be busy). Called the front desk again and supplies still never came. So we decided to buy our own toilet paper and other supplies that supposedly the hotel supplies but never did. We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and it was the most excruciating 5 days. Stay as far away as possible from this hotel. Take your money somewhere else where you will be treated better and actually receive a 5 star accommodation and service. Marriot should evaluate there hotels and make sure that they are up to there standard cuz this one is definitely not there.

",2,2022,08,23
13,Great customer service,"Our stay at the Cotton House was exception.  The concierge took care of us and a shout out to Reyes who was amazing.   The room was spacious and very comfortable.  I wish I had the same type of shower in my home.  From the time we arrived, we were offered champagne and water.    Great vibe in the restaurant and bar as well.  Location was excellent.",5,2022,08,15
13,Contessa,"I went to the hotel to check it out since I wanted to visit with my husband. A rude young girl och a boy in the reception did not let me visit the rooftoop since I was not staying at the hotel . I had friends staying there coming later but they did not let me go up.
Very rude.",1,2022,08,13
13,We Loved Staying at the Cotton House,"From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, we were had a very friendly greeting by the staff at the front desk.  They offered us with icy cold water and refreshing cava, which was much needed after a long journey from California.  After freshening up, we toured the hotel which is as lovely as it is depicted on the website.  It was bigger than it actually looked online.  We picked it because we want a hotel that had a Barcelona/historic ambiance which the Cotton House delivered.

Our first stop was the restaurant/bar.  Alessio was our mixologist and he was the best along with everyone there.  He gave us a lesson in Vermut and made us the best drinks.  We spent a lot of time at the the bar. It was such a beautiful place.  We loved it.  We asked Alessio about his favorite places other than the Cotton House.

The rooms were really nice and relaxing.  The bed and pillows were so comfortable.  We slept so good.  I loved the lotion, soap and other toiletries that were provided. Our room had amazing views.  Everyone that we chatted with at the hotel was friendly and helpful.

It was also centrally located which really helped.

It's a beautiful hotel!  We can't wait to stay there again.",5,2022,07,27
13,First Impressions are lasting,"We contacted the hotel prior to arriving to enquire about arranging an antigen test which we required 24 hours prior to boarding our Silverseas ship in Barcelona. 
They responded immediately and sorted a Dr to come and conduct the tests in our room in the hotel.The.person I dealt with was Julia on the Concierge desk- she was so, so professional and also extremely friendly. 
We booked our room via American Express Platinum Fine Hotels and Resorts programme , all of the benefits were awarded at check in.I have advised my American Express Account manager of this. On arrival in the hotel we had lunch in the private beautiful courtyard.My husband is a connoisseur of burgers and said it was the best he had in a long time. As previously arranged by Julia the Dr came as arranged at 430pm and conducted the tests. The Dr was extremely efficient and pleasant.We had the test results emailed to us in approx.10 mins, the results were thankfully positive.
The room in the hotel was not big but had a fab bathroom and also a small balcony which looked over the courtyard. We both slept extremely well. Breakfast in the courtyard was outstanding. My husband actually went back to bed after breakfast as the bed was so,so comfortable. We travel extensively and over the years this is most probably the most comfortable bed we slept on. I went to the best el Corte Ingles about a 15 minute walk from hotel. 
So in summary we would totally recommend this hotel for location, interior design ,,service , although at times for refreshments in courtyard it could be slow but the staff were so pleasant you could not complain. 
The General ambience in the hotel is outstanding. 
We have stayed at numerous 5 star properties in Barcelona over the years and The Cotton Club would most definitely stand out as one of the best. 
Thank -you once again  to the wonderful team and General Manager who runs a fabulous property.😊",5,2022,07,27
13,Centrally located beautifully renovated boutique hotel that serves up charm and refinement in equal measure,"Gorgeous hotel with sumptuous furnishings and decor, very pleasant helpful staff, and so nicely located in walking distance to lots of the main attractions of Barcelona. Close to the Ramblas and lots of high end shopping and cafes and restaurants.",5,2022,07,24
13,Another Amazing Stay at the Cotton House!,"We consider this to be our home base in Barcelona! This was our third stay, and cannot wait to come back! The staff was always warm and personable, with honorable mentions going to Julia, Reyes, Fran, Goof, Javier, Deni, and Olivia! They always take such good care of us and are so responsive, with everything from upgrading our room to making reservations on our behalf at our favorite restaurants in the city.  

As always, the interior of the hotel is stunning and we are obsessed with the signature scent, so much so that we have purchased their home fragrance.  The breakfast buffet is well-curated and high quality, and it is so amazing to start off the day with having a long, leisurely, sun-drenched breakfast on the terrace.  

We love this hotel so much and cannot wait to come back next year!",5,2022,07,24
13,Beautiful Hotel. Great for Business or Family,This is a beautiful hotel.  Full of history. An amazing circular stairway going up 6 floors.  Indoor /outdoor dining.  Excellent service.   Food.  Beautiful floors.   We felt safe and comfortable.  There is a lobby sitting area.   And then up one floor on the 1 st floor. Is the restaurant and a library.   Great for business or family.,5,2022,07,19
13,Cannot say enough good things about Cotton House!!,"We have just returned from a couple of weeks of traveling in Europe, and Cotton House was by far our favorite hotel. By FAR.  And it is now one of our favorite hotels ever. Cotton House is perfectly located, with great amenities, extremely comfortable rooms, and beautiful ""common areas"" like the library, which really shows off some of the history of this great property. We had two rooms, and both of them were great - the beds were extremely comfortable, and quiet at night. The restaurant area which has breakfast in the morning is really nice - and the breakfasts were fantastic, with a wide variety of things to choose from and unique items that we really loved (for example, the salmon toasts were delicious, and they made beautifully decorated cupcakes with American flags when we walked in for breakfast on the 4th of July!). Casa Batllo, Casa Mila, Barri Gotic and essentially all of central Barcelona are within easy walking distance, and there is a gorgeous view of the city and Sagrada Familia from the rooftop. Prices for everything are very reasonable. But the best part? The people. Everyone in the hotel was extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful - there is a great staff here from top to bottom. The dream team front desk staff of Julia, Laura and Goof were absolutely fantastic - we would have liked to spend more time with them if we could - they were a lot of fun to talk with! Reyes was always very kind to us and always super friendly and helpful, and he always had a smile on his face. We miss them and everyone at the hotel already! We will come back again for sure. Great job Cotton House!!",5,2022,07,17
13,"Beautiful hotel, great location, excellent service!","From the moment we checked in (quite early) we were welcomed warmly by the staff (with a glass of cava) while we waited just a few minutes for our upgraded room to be ready.  Our room wasn't  especially large, but it was comfortable and, had huge closet and bathroom as well as a Juliet balcony overlooking the Gran Via.  The pool area on the roof is small but lovely with attentive service.  I had excellent oysters poolside.  The rest of the hotel has been beautifully renovated as well, and the food and service at the restaurant, Batuar, were both outstanding.  This was a great last hotel for this trip--perfect amount of relaxation and indulgence but close enough to the hustle and bustle of Barcelona to see the sites easily.",5,2022,07,13
13,Great stay,"We stayed from June 7-11, The hotel is charming and the staff is accommodating and friendly, We had breakfast there daily and it was wonderful. Bell staff was incredibly helpful. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Highly recommend!",5,2022,07,13
13,Gorgeous Hotel,"Just got back form 2 nights staying at the Cotton House Hotel and it was amazing! It had been a long travel day, and when we were checking in we were offered a delicious glass of Cava. Check in was a breeze and while the room was a bit on the smaller side, it was expected in such a historic building. I can only assume they gave an upgrade due to my Bonvoy status as we were pleasantly surprised with a luxurious King bed when we had only booked a queen (it was the only option available when we booked). 

The hotel space was amazing (loved reading in the library) and my wife loved the roof top pool for some mornings laps. Breakfast was great each morning with wonderful service from Alex, and when it came time to check out Reyes was very helpful.

Will definitely be staying here again!",5,2022,07,10
13,AVOID THE COTTON HOUSE With better options in the area,"The Cotton House hotel was a total disappointment.  They were rude from the beginning.   I had a reservation for 2 adults 1 child and we were 1 adult 2 children.  They did not like children, we are also Bonvoy Ambassador status and were treated like crap.  Room was a small shoe box that we could barely walk in.  The TV did not work and no one knew how to fix it despite asking a few times.  They asked for extra money because my 12 year old daughter was in the room.  They then would pass on blame to other staff instead of simply taking ownership.  They promised to fix the tv but then didn't bother to until after we checked out.  The manager was to contact us but failed to until after we checked out.  The stay was awful.  Shampoo bottle is attached to the wall but fell off the wall, when asking for ice or water, no one would bring it unless calling a few times repeatedly.  This was a 1 star experience.",1,2022,07,10
13,Great boutique hotel with a rich history,"Boutique hotel downtown within walking distance to all major sights.  Front desk staff are exceptional, rooms are cozy and courtyard restaurant is wonderful.  We were treated to a glass of champagne upon arrival.
The decor and history of the building is worth the visit.",5,2022,07,06
13,Gorgeous hotel in a great location,"The cotton house is a beautiful hotel in a great location. We loved the small details and the architectural grandeur. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the shower was one of the best I've had at a hotel.  The pool area is small but it is perfect for a jet lagged afternoon. 

All the staff were incredibly sweet and helpful. 

The only cons here were the quality of the food, and the fact that they use so many small bottled waters! The latter could easily be remedied with an in-house water purification system using glass bottles. #marriot Make the investment! 

As for the food I would start with serving high quality breads and butter, and better coffee. 

Nicely done, would recommend this hotel! ",4,2022,07,03
13,Would definitely stay again,"Great location, great breakfast, helpful staff. Stayed for 5 nights in a triple room. Room was tight with the pull out bed pulled out but to be expected in Europe. Room turned down each night, water on the night stand.
Location unbeatable, walking distance to Las Ramblas and a shirt cab to the beach. Would definitely stay again.",5,2022,06,30
13,"Small rooms, some issues but a wonderful hotel","A debacle at check-in when my booking (Amex FHR) somehow turned into a rack rate without any benefits. I fail to understand how you can find my booking but somehow change the rate and benefits. The chap who checked me in must have been a trainee but he didn't even tell me what rate he was charging me - good thing I checked - but it was a nightmare to sort. Without a night duty manager the front desk seemed largely indifferent to my concerns about being charge 800 euros a night for just a standard room. Even in the morning when they managed to sort out my booking, no attempt was made to inform me despite my repeated requests and I had to chase it up with the front desk. Rather unprofessional and a bad start.

The room (Cotton) was nicely furnished but there was no space for a suitcase - now I realize a lot of their clientele would be on city breaks with just cabin bags, but if you have a check in case or two good luck finding a place to put them. Half the room was taken up by the bathroom, which was separated into two rooms. The shower and bath area was pretty big but very industrial; not a fan of the shower gel/shampoo dispensers they made me feel like I was at my gym or an airport lounge shower room. There was also mould on the walls. The bed however was amazing and the terrace made up for the shortcomings, despite facing the internal courtyard. Although it can be a little noisy the bar shuts early.

The library/lounge of the hotel is stunning, as are most of the common areas and the restaurant and bar. The pool is tiny as is the gym. The staff - other than reception which seemed incompetent at check in - were very nice and gave the impression that they were genuinely making an effort. So whilst they may not be as polished as some other hotels they make up for that with their warmth and enthusiasm. I think they may be short staffed as there was no doorman when we arrived in the evening.

The food was excellent, especially their made to order sweet dishes at breakfast (and lunch) which were outstanding. Not a huge buffet selection but the quality of their made to order dishes makes up for this and it is one hotel breakfast I would happily pay for and highly recommend. Good cocktails at the bar too. 

Even though the hotel was full it never felt crowded, unlike the Majestic. The location is decent and the area is a lot quieter. Despite the industrial shower, small and rather cramped room, the hotel has a lot of charm and i really enjoyed staying there. Even with the debacle at check-in, the young staff are genuinely friendly and warm and a little polish would fix those issues which shouldn't exist at this price point.",4,2022,06,27
13,Wonderful stay. Overdelivered on my expectations,"Interior of the hotel is absolutely stunning. Rooms made very good use of the space available, I had to do work and found the rooms a joy to stay in. Balcony was absolutely lovely and flooded the room with generous light and fresh air.

Restaurant and bar service was top notch and very friendly. Staff in general was very friendly

Bottles of water were provided morning and evening in the room. I would have preferred these to be readily available on demand as the municipal water tastes a bit funny.

Other than that though was a wonderful stay. I visited a couple of other hotels where friends were staying at, namely the Alma and the Grand Central. Both fantastic hotels too but Cotton House  would still be my first pick 

Also thanks to Reyes for handling my luggage and flagging down a taxi very quickly on my way to the airport",5,2022,06,19
13,Don’t respect Marriott Status Members,"Overall a charming hotel with okay proximity to main attractions. The service of check in is lacking with no special consideration or treatment for marriott members with status, ie titanium elite. This includes No upgrades, made me wait until check in time for my room. Empty promises to check for upgrades the next day. Mario the front office manager was especially rude and actually raised my daily rate claiming that i had booked an over 65 rate.

The room itself was very small, with one window of an interior light well. No help for customers as they check out. We wheeled 3 large bags past check out with no offers to help. Based on check in and out experience I will not return and would not recommend to any marriott members with status.",1,2022,06,14
13,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service","The rooms were gorgeous and comfortable - best bed I have ever slept in. The service was great from the moment we walked in, especially Reyes, who went above and beyond in assisting with baggage, calling us a car, etc.",5,2022,06,13
13,Beautiful property.  Small rooms. ,"Stayed 2N. The property feels like you're staying in a rich person's house.  As a Plat, I was given the room that I booked without an upgrade. The panoramic room was small. A small window opened into an alley. Mattress and pillows were very soft.  Washbasin didn't drain properly.  Body wash dispenser was missing.  Breakfast was nice in the leafy courtyard.  Staff very courteous.  Nice location within walking courtyard to shops and restaurants.  ",3,2022,06,12
13,Best decision for our Barcelona trip.,"Where do I start?  Wonderful location, beautiful, clean rooms. Breakfast was delicious. Julia, part of the concierge staff, helped us with restaurant reservations, taxi to the airport and much more.  The tour guide she set us up with, Carmen, was excellent. Reyes helped us with Barcelona safety tips and cheerfully transported our mountain of luggage.",5,2022,06,11
13,Cotton House AC - The Place to Stay in Barcelona,"This is a beautiful AC property in a central location in Barcelona. It is modern, has tastefully appointed rooms, beautiful restaurant, great rooftop pool/bar and a wonderful breakfast. All of these fine amenities are complemented by a truly caring and service-oriented staff. From the time we arrived until we left they were constantly looking for more ways to make our stay exceptional - and they succeeded. We would come back here to stay every time.",5,2022,06,10
13,In one word - perfect,"Our family stay was truly a great experience. Excellent location, amenities are only bested by the amazing staff. They go the extra mile with everything they do. Special mention to Reyes (Doorman), who is the absolute best. Mario at front desk was very helpful, and the Concierge Noel provided excellent recommendations. I spend 75 nights/year in hotels and don't write many reviews. Our experience was absolutely top notch !",5,2022,06,07
13,Loved our stay. Excellent service!,"My wife and I loved our stay at Cotton House. Amazing location proximate to the shops / restaurants along Passeig de Gracia, La Sagrada Familia, Gothic Quarter, etc. Beautiful rooftop deck and lounge area as well. Mario at the front desk and Javier at concierge were both extremely helpful, patient and kind. We’ll definitely be back!",5,2022,06,06
13,Highly recommend,"Absolutely LOVED this charming, beautiful, clean little boutique hotel. Was really gorgeous. The staff is fantastic.  From the front desk people to the concierge to the servers to the bellman. They couldn’t have been nicer.   The breakfast area was so lovely. Truly enjoyed.",5,2022,05,29
13,Excellent spot,"Not sure what more you could ask for in this gem. Great location.  Wonderful staff.  The doorman Reyes was a great representative of the property.  Upbeat, informative, accommodating.  We really liked the location and morning breakfast in the courtyard was quite lovely.  The shower was great and the A/C in the room got cold as ice.  LOVED IT!  Can't wait to come back.",5,2022,05,26
13,Amazing Trek Back in Time..,"When traveling and looking to feel immersed in a time and culture this is a treat…
From the moment you walk in the door the staff welcome pour of champagne to the signature Cotton House scent that greets your soul feels instantly transported.
The details of a time gone by are unique and beautiful.    Take a moment for a signature cocktail to further imagine the many meetings of the textile trade that passed thru the doors.   Be sure to enjoy a leisurely evening  meal in the garden.
Start your morning at the rooftop pool to absorb the Barcelona morning sun and welcoming sound of birds to the day before setting off to discover the beautiful city..",5,2022,05,22
13,"Three ""circles"" if I was rating a five-star hotel...","but four ""circles"" if I was rating a four-star hotel, which this decidedly is, at least for the time being. I'll start with the good stuff first. Friendly, helpful employees at every post, fun decor (even if they take ""the cotton thing"" a bit far), comfortable bed and bedding. Now, for the not-so-good stuff. The hotel is stingy with bath linens (I get more towels at a Courtyard!), drinking glasses (received two clean ones the first few days but not on any days after that, even after saying something). soap (one bar, no stocked extra, for the week, coffee pods (rationed two per day, otherwise you have to purchase them), and two very-small bottles of water per day. Not what you'd expect from a five-star hotel, certainly. We found ourselves hoarding, say, our drinking glasses and rewashing them! Regarding the restaurant (where we would normally have spent more time and money), again the servers were extremely pleasant, but service was ridiculously slow. Regarding, cleanliness, those baseboards in the bathrooms could use a serious dusting.

Here's hoping that the Cotton House pays heed to some of its recent more-negative reviews; and here's also hoping that these are symptoms of pandemic shortages and the like, and that the hotel can get it together to achieve a five-star experience. Further, in light of one or two negative reviews, i feel it necessary to point out that we used no discounts or upgrade ""coupons"" when we booked--we paid ""sticker price,"" as it were.",3,2022,05,20
13,Five star service and accommodations,"This hotel is beautiful, sophisticated and moody. The common areas are unique and well appointed. The food is delicious. The patio restaurant seating was a special treat. The room was well designed with a very comfortable bed and soft, lovely linens.",5,2022,05,17
13,Doorman Reyes Was the Only Good Part of This Hotel,"I traveled to Barcelona with my daughter and thought I was staying at a 5 star Autograph Collection Hotel, but it was definitely not.  I will say Reyes the doorman is amazing, caring and his customer service is the best I have witnessed in a very long time.  I hope he finds a job somewhere else though because the rest of this review is not good about Cotton House.  

I am an Amex Business Platinum member as well as a Marriott Bonvoy member.  I booked this hotel through Amex travel.  Since I traveled from the US our flight was overnight and upon landing American Airlines lost our luggage so we went straight to the hotel.  I went to the desk to try and check in and the staff behind the desk is extremely smug.  First, I asked to check in and he told me my room was not ready yet because I arrived too early.  I advised them I understand that but we lost our luggage and flew overnight and had no clothing or toiletries.  They offered us nothing but a map of the city to go buy clothes or to go up to their restaurant and eat but it would be several hours before a room was ready.  They offered no toiletries at all and they could care less we lost luggage or that we have to wait several hours.  

We were so exhausted and only wanted a bed and shower so we tried to shop for a bit and then came back and literally sat in their lobby. for over and hour  I then watched other people check in without any issue and they were given their room keys.  I was told my particular room still had people in it who had not checked out.  Then when I asked about this, the man behind the counter smirked and said, but you booked this on Expedia.  I told no I did not do that and then informed him how I booked through Amex Travel and I had no idea why that was relevant but I felt like I was being judged for not booking directly through the hotel.  He only offered to update my booking with my Marriott number.  As an Amex booking though I am supposed to get an early checkin if available and a free upgrade if available, although those perks seem to be a joke because it's never ""available"".  

So I sat back down, but I was treated like I booked the hotel on a discount and honestly even if I did, no customer should be treated like a discount.  Eventually my daughter who is 23 fell asleep on their couch, which is not a good look for a hotel lobby and was only at that time that all the sudden our room was ready.  

I also had only 50's in Euros with me from the airport and I-asked them to change them for me and he left my euros sit on the counter almost as if he was trying to embarrass me only to then tell me they have nothing less than 50's in Euros also.  Again, he did this while smugly smirking and I can't understand why.  

Upon entering the room it was warm and stuffy and it was very evident the room was not just turned over that minute and in fact, it seemed as if it hadn't been lived in for quite a few days.  I feel like they made me wait on a principal alone.  As if to teach me a lesson, but I am unsure what that lesson is since I can't control how early my flight got in, couldn't control the fact that I wanted to-lay down and sleep and shower etc.  The room also was older and was not a 5 star room by any means.  It was very small and the bed was thin and uncomfortable.  

The restaurant was also not welcoming and in fact I felt like they quite often rushed us especially at breakfast.  Although the first time in the restaurant they took so long bringing food a few other tables got up and walked out and then I started to leave when our food was brought.  Yet a few days later they rushed us out after breakfast and you could tell they did not care for us sitting and talking while sipping coffee.  I did not spend more than 30 minutes there.  

The hotel is rude, cold and subpar and I would never stay here again.",1,2022,05,12
13,An amateur hotel,"If you choose this hotel because of the location, I want to tell you that El Palace is 10m away.

It was a trip to the Catalunya region with my parents and friend.
We needed to get the regular PCR test for returning to our country by the policy of our government. So I arranged the test at the hotel in advance by talking to the concierge of Cotton House Hotel.
The doctor came at the promised time on the 2nd of May, and she said if we paid a total of 160 Euros by adding 40 Euros to the regular test fee of 120 Euros, we could receive the test results in two hours.
My mother decided to pay 160 Euros for this express test because she wanted to receive the results as soon as possible to keep her mind stable and comfortable for the rest of the journey.
We waited for the result throughout the trip, but it took 5 hours to get someone else's result. There was other customers' personal information. (I guess they didn't tell the customer about the situation and didn't apologize to them) So I talked to the staff at the front desk, and finally, we received the result at almost midnight. However, there was no description of the time when my mother took the test. I sent an email to the concierge about this situation again the next day, but they didn't respond. (The Korean government requires the PCR tests within 48 hours of departure in the departure country) So, I talked to the concierge on the 1st floor, and she told me to take care of it. But, I didn't get any response from them again. We stopped the schedule, went back to the hotel around 5 PM, talked to the staff at the front desk, and she reported to the supervisor. The supervisor told us through her staff that we needed to go to the 1st floor and talk to the concierge directly. I was so embarrassed about her response, but I went upstairs and spoke to the concierge once again. She promised to call my room, but there was no call until 6:15 PM. I went down to the 1st floor and found out the concierge had left work.

The supervisor came out and said that the time when the result was reported was the legal standard in Spain. So then, there was no problem from the beginning. Why did they explain it at that time? The hotel had the test result sheet at the hotel before handed to me. Moreover, the PCR test was required from the government of Korea, not Spain. From that moment, I could not trust any staff in the hotel. I wasted a lot of time and emotions. I went to the airport with my parents the next day and had to explain the test was taken within 48 hours.

They took no responsibility for the extra 40 euros I paid and wasted my family's feelings and time. No one but Ms. Anika apologized for the situation and tried to solve the problem. I want to thank Ms. Anika for her efforts.

For your information, when I returned to Korea (I stayed one week more than my parents), I stayed at another hotel and took the PCR test through another lab. Even though I did not request it in advance, they filled in the inspection time and gave the result sheet to me until the promised time.

The following are things I don't usually report, but I want to talk about now.

#1. At check-in, the staff told me that they upgraded my room by three categories, but I think it would be better to express that they accepted the SNA (Suite Night Awards). I didn't receive any upgrades other than SNA.

#2. The hotel staff collected all the towels when cleaning room 302, but they didn't give me anything, so I had to request by phone.

#3. I talked enough with the concierge and booked the restaurant ABaC, but the concierge double-booked the Disfrutar restaurant on the same day.

I think this is an amateur hotel that needs to be managed by Marriott's headquarters.",2,2022,05,12
13,"Solid, but not amazing, choice","We love the Autograph collection hotels as a general rule - we prefer smaller boutique hotels to the large chains.  The risk, of course, is that the quality can be a bit uneven, and that was the case here.  The public spaces at this hotel are beautiful.  The rooms are a bit small and in need of a refresh.  The breakfast at the restaurant was tasty, but service was quite slow and forgetful - we left more than once without everything we had ordered.  It seemed like they were overwhelmed, even when the place was not particularly busy.  The coffee service, in particular, was frustratingly slow - there was no do-it-yourself option and no brewed coffee, and every espresso/cappuccino order took ages to arrive.  They need something easy for people who just want some quick coffee.  There also were no egg options as part of the buffet - you had to order them separately, and they took a while.  It would be good if they just had some boiled eggs or something like that for people who want a quick egg option.  The concierge was also a little bit disorganized - they had no record of multiple reservations we had made through the hotel.  The front desk staff, however, was super friendly and helpful.  In terms of location, we liked the beautiful and quiet street the hotel was on, but it is a bit away from the main tourist attractions in the gothic quarter.  That worked out very well for us, but for others who want everything to be within a short walk, it would not be a good option.  On the plus side, it was relatively close to the Gaudi buildings in the Eixample neighborhood.",4,2022,05,03
13,You want 5 star experience --stay herer,"This was our fist time to Barcelona and we made  a great, great decision to stay the Cotton house. uncompromising  elegance, topped by extraordinary caring staff.Every person on their staff was a concierge--they loved their jobs and it was evident. Special shout to Alex who settled us in by taking us to the garden bar/ restaurant since our room wasn't quite ready.They even pad the room doors in leather.
The staff set up our pre cruise boarding testing by having a clinician com to our room to conduct the rapid covid test. We only had a couple of days in Barcelona but plan to return and will definitely stay at the Cotton House. Thanks guys and gals!",5,2022,05,02
13,Classy hotel in a lovely area.,"We enjoyed a 3 generation stay in late April. The hotel is in a wonderful location, everyone was very friendly and helpful. My 12 year old granddaughter loved the pool and the library! The beds were so comfortable and the outdoor balcony was perfect for TikTok videos to send back to her NJ friends. We felt pampered and welcomed. Highly recommend and will return.",5,2022,05,01
13,Disappointing and over rated…,"Having stayed at this hotel some 2 years ago, we decided to stay once again for almost 1 week as a family of four.

We’re really disappointed at the very bad experience we had day after day at the restaurant, specially for breakfast.

We had to wait in average 30m to receive our order of “hot” dishes, from a menu of about 8 options…. On our first day we waited 30m to be told they run out of pancakes.  Having order those for our kids it wasn’t a pleasant news .  Eggs were always cooked wrongly and it took really long to get a coffee…. Yogurts  expired, Burnt toast…and in general a very unexperience group of young friendly people that try their best but that was unfortunately not enough to match the 5 star standard they are so proud of.

We provided feedback to reception, restaurant staff, etc… just to be told that indeed it’s a very frustrating situation known by everyone and they are working on it….. so it appears that the hotel staff is more frustrated than the guests!! Very unusual and sad situation indeed…

Most dresses worn by the female staff were covered in stains, some of them worn wrong dresses size, not even belts seemed to fit properly, hygiene is key specially when working at the restaurant, uniforms are a great marketing tool however under those circumstances they can become your worst enemy….As customer you feel somehow mislead and for sure over charged…

Rooms are really tiny, even the suites …. It took about 4 days to remove some cups from our room, only when we left a note to the cleaning service to politely mention that the cups belonged to the hotel they were removed.   Instead of nice toiletries they have placed 3 big bottles in the wall of the shower, I haven’t seen that in a 5 star hotel before… 

Beds are really comfortable and very good location, unfortunately all other things are a big put off specially for the price they charge per night…

On a bright side: Ferran from the restaurant at night, very helpful and great with kids, he was one of the few people that made them feel welcomed and special…other than that for kids: nothing…. Not even a welcomed sweet or kid’s menu.  This wasn’t the case 2 years ago, I’m sure there are many ways to make kids feel comfortable and happy that do not risk c-19 protocols…

All in all a very disappointing visit, we were told many times they are aware of the poor standards and are working on it… fair enough, however not at all matching the expectations they create by charging for a 5 star service and experience that doesn’t exist.",2,2022,04,30
13,Hit all the marks!,"We had a really lovely time at Cotton House in Barcelona April ‘22. The staff were patient and professional. The decorating concept seamless and the spaces that created were varied, interesting a relaxing. We visited the outdoor terrace too many times to recount and were pleased with each. The food there, particularly the tapas on the terrace, was first rate (don’t skip the croquettes). The location was perfect for us. The concierge arranged a dinner which resulted in one of our most memorable meals. Breakfast was perfect - we had the buffet but a la carte looked equally appealing. Every detail, spot on. Thanks at the end to Reyes who hailed a cab and had us on our way. We have recommended to friends and family and are already planning our return. (NB: we were upgraded to a suite via Amex Platinum, but I am sure any room would elicit the same glowing review).",5,2022,04,17
13,No value for money. Tiny rooms. Weak service.,"Paid over 400 euro a night per room for a 20sqm room size at most, so definitely no value for money. Hotel staff were nice however all young and not experienced. I went to the restaurant ( only one where also breakfast is served ) at 1 pm it was empty. I wanted to have lunch and the young hostess told me it’s all booked for lunch ( and all empty tables!) of course I got angry and finally they gave me a table with a condition to leave by 2pm. I didn’t and at 230 pm place was still half empty ( hour and half after I arrived ). Food was average ( steak was like a chewing gum) and over priced.  Never again. 

Breakfast was acceptable but then again service was as very bad. Slow and they forgot many things you request. 

We constantly had problems with the room keys not working ( see photos ). We asked for maintenance but they never came to fix our door. 

No management or managers on site. One bell boy in entire hotel so you have to wait for your turn !  
Good location however would never go back for the price vs tiny room size vs weak service. 

The best hotel in town the arts hotel is charging almost the same as cotton house for 10x value for money",3,2022,04,14
13,Shabby,"A newish hotel but currently looking a little shabby. Dirty carpets and dustly light fittings that I would expect to be dealt with from such an establishment. That aside, we were seen but ignored by the bar staff for 15 minutes and eventually decided to leave. This has happened previously but it won’t happen again. Previous experiences have been delightful and I am loathed to simply attribute Covid. I would hope that the management now pays more attention both to detail and the service they provide.",1,2022,04,13
13,My new favorite hotel in Barcelona!,Cotton House is Amazing!! A small boutique style property in a superb location. Our room was absolutely lovely and very spacious (huge for European standards).  Everyone at the hotel goes out of their way to assure guests have the most perfect stay. The common areas are very hip and cool with beautiful decorations. Great food and cocktails. Loved the location as we were able to walk almost everywhere and about 15 min to the Gothic area where we spent a lot of time. There are fantastic cafes and tapas bars within a few blocks. All of the hotel concierge restaurants recommendations were terrific. It’s my new favorite hotel to stay at in Barcelona!,5,2022,04,11
13,"Nice stay, beautiful hotel, recommended with some caveats","We found that the Cotton House hotel was a beautiful hotel, well located in Barcelona.  

The building is an old Barcelona Cotton Association headquarters and has a beautiful marble staircase on one side, a 20th Century spiral staircase on the other, and the library, sitting, breakfast/dining areas are beautifully done.  It's very nice and impressive.  The hotel appropriately uses cotton as its accents in decorating, but it can be a bit kitschy at times.

I would have given the hotel five stars except for the room sizes and the staffing.  The staff was very polite and had a professional appearance.  But it seemed apparent that almost all of the reception staff, bar staff, hostesses etc. were college students on internships.  There seemed to be no middle management present anywhere in the hotel.  None of the staff, except at night, were Spanish/Catalan.  Many of the staff didn't speak any Spanish at all or quickly asked you to speak in English.  When I travel, I like to interact with locals, even at the hotel.  So I found it to be odd I had to speak in English many times at the hotel.  The service was not ""five star"" as the staff's attentiveness in the restaurant and bar seemed to be more of a college atmosphere of interacting with their colleagues as opposed to servicing their guests, e.g. having to ask for coffee at breakfast three times, etc.  Again, the staff was nice and polite, just not polished enough for a five star experience in the dining areas.  We had nice interactions with everyone.

The rooms were a bit small or tight for my tastes, HOWEVER they were very new and clean and welcoming.  I would suggest a street view if you're picking a room.  We had three rooms in total for our family.

All in all, I recommend the hotel.  They just need a few more grown ups overseeing the business.",4,2022,03,26
13,outstanding! Fabulous customer service!,"We were warmly greeted by Eddie who took our luggage and gave us champagne in a beautiful flute and Laura who was very kind and efficient and made sure we received all of the benefits we were provided by booking with American Express. The room was lovely and we had a nice patio with comfortable chairs and tables. The hotel has a wonderful history and we enjoyed our room and delicious dinner served by the very efficient Fatima and the gracious manager, Ricardo and Sophie provided us with excellent service as well and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was very good and the breakfast room is warm and inviting and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and Goff was another wonderful employee who made our trip so special!",5,2022,03,13
13,"Great location, Great service, Great City","My boyfriend and I were traveling through Spain, and came across this hotel.  The hotel is in a great location, and the staff are amazing.  Particularly Reyes who gave us a guided tour of the history of the hotel, but also helped us with our luggage the whole time.  The rooms are on the small side, which was fine and expected for an old hotel.  The only thing is don't share a room with someone if you need privacy, the shower is in the middle of the room and with a slightly see through glass.",5,2022,03,12
13,Awesome service! Incredible staff and beautiful hotel.,"Incredible staff at the Cotton House - attentive, personable and informative. The hotel itself was beautiful, super clean and in a great location. Very easy to get just about everywhere we wanted to go. The restaurant and bar area is beautiful and the food was very good.",5,2022,03,12
13,Fell slightly short of expectation,"I appreciate the fastidious, guest-focused staff at Cotton House Hotel. They seemed to genuinely care about me and my experience. That's the good. The not-so-good is that the hotel didn't execute some things that were important to me. I had to move to a different room twice because of toilets that splashed on the floor or toilet seat. The housekeeping staff could have worked harder to keep things clean, orderly, including putting back on the shower drain cover they took off each time they cleaned my room. Perhaps most of all, staff could have resolved more quickly my concerns related to late-night noise. The guest on the floor directly above me seemed to return each night around midnight. No problem -- except for the high heels, or what sounded like that, on the hardwood floors. (I appreciate that the staff moved me on the next-to-last night of my stay. More, while I did not request it, they upgraded my room and put me on the top floor to ensure quiet.) Ask me about Cotton House Hotel, and I'll tell you to expect beautiful decor, a great neighborhood, and a staff that is committed to the highest-level service, even if from my vantage point it's not able to deliver that just yet.",4,2022,03,07
13,Nice Hotel But Not a Five-Star Experience,"We recently spent a week at this hotel and our stay was perfectly adequate but not what one would expect for a five-star hotel. Things just seemed off from the moment we pulled up to the hotel when we weren’t sure whether the young man who offered to help us was the bellman or was trying to steal our luggage. 

The check-in process went smoothly and we were super grateful for the very early check-in. We were offered a glass of water and not the sparking wine other guests have mentioned. 

The room itself was on the small side, which made it difficult to store our two large suitcases as there was nowhere to put them other than in the middle of the main path through the room and no luggage racks were provided. On the positive side the balcony facing the courtyard was lovely and the bed itself was maybe the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The room was also very dark and quiet except for the one night when our neighbors had a small party. We had to call the front desk to get washcloths (not routinely provided evidently) and a TV remote, which was missing (and rather than just sending up a remote someone first came to look under our bed).

The service was unremarkable and most of the staff did not go out of their way to greet us. There was also no apparent concierge and several times we went down to the front desk and there was no one there at all. 

The food was excellent albeit expensive. When we went down to the restaurant on our first night, the host chastised us several times for not making reservations. While standing there waiting to be seated, one waiter threw a piece of trash right past my face, which startled me and seemed rude. Then the waiter poured wine for the table by reaching right across my boyfriend’s face. While these are minor incidents, they added to the general perception of an unfriendly staff. 

We chose this hotel as we are loyal to the Marriott brand for its excellent customer service and we wanted the vibe of a boutique hotel, but this experience did not live up to Marriott standards or our high expectations. I know that covid has been challenging for many in the tourism sector so I am still giving the hotel four stars while they adapt to returning tourists.",4,2022,02,27
13,Beautiful Old Hotel,"The Cotton House used to be a trading area and storehouse for cotton.  Much of the ornate detail from the transaction area is beautifully restored and turned into common areas in the hotel.  The rooms are a nice size for a hotel in a downtown area,

There is a great open air, bar area in a tropical surrounding.  Very relaxing place to have a glass of wine and unwind after visiting Barcelona's many attractions.

The staff is wonderful and accommodating.  They arranged a covid test for our return to the states.  English is spoken here as well as their native language.",5,2022,02,24
13,"Décor, people, comfort, location, food, architecture - cannot wait to return!","Many of the Barcelona hotels looked enticing on-line so my daughter and I had a hard time choosing. We were seeing Spain for the first time – visiting my son studying in the city.  We wanted to make the right choice and are thrilled that we picked the Cotton House.

Alex, the very friendly doorman, was the first and last person we saw. He was a smiling face the entire week.  Both he and Aitor took the time to show off the city to us from the rooftop of the hotel. Their excitement for the city and the hotel impressed. 

Countless things stood out for us during our vacation week – 
-The elegant, rich yet cozy and light-filled interior of an historic palace added to the sense of wonder and beauty.  The stunning restaurant, gorgeous library and open spaces all tied in with the cotton-industry past.  Library was a warm, exquisite spot to curl up with book and gather quietly before dinner.
Batuar Restaurant was fabulous!!  The chef prepared incredible meals all day and evening and we took full advantage of room service.  The breakfasts were so good we lingered no less than 2 hours each morning.  By far the best patatas bravas and lattes in Barcelona.  The signature ""breakfast"" waffle - complete with cotton candy and ice cream - is a standout.

The restaurant is light-filled and open, laid out with essentially five gorgeous unique and equally inviting spaces.  I loved the bar area with fireplace and caramel-leather tufted banqets.  My daughter adored the smallest space, with walls of glass shelving and cabinetry housing sheaths of fine cotton.  
The friendly and attentive staff takes customer service seriously. We were so grateful to the Concierge - Marian and Javier were spot-on with their restaurant recommendations and arranged seamless Covid tests for us with Dr housecalls.  
If pressed to say something negative – I would only mention two things:
1. The mirrored gym is small.  But it doesn’t disappoint as it’s packed with beautiful, new equipment – two weight racks, elliptical, bike and the cushiest exercise mat ever.
2. The cleaning staff could be more proactive with replacing and sticking coffee, towels, Kleenex etc.  Plus each room receives just 2 Nespresso pods/day.  But housekeeping are all lovely and arrive at your door in just moments with anything you need. Shoutout to Alejandro from housekeeping staff!

Back to the abundant positives – 

The front desk staff is SO accommodating and professional.  We especially appreciated Mario, Anika, Ricote and Javier, as well as the two door men)
A great playlist adds to the relaxed and happy ambience in the public spaces.
Regarding our room, we upgraded from a King-Courtyard to a larger room on the 1st floor with a King and  comfortable pull-out couch.  We enjoyed the beautiful private terrace and would request this same room again.
The “value” pricing is icing on the cake for this upscale hotel.  The décor, the people, the comfort, location, food, architecture.  This unique hotel made our vacation even better – we cannot wait to return.",5,2022,02,23
13,Exceeded our expectations - Amazing.,"This hotel completely exceeded our expectations. Above all else, the staff were fantastic and worked extremely hard help us at all times. They were friendly, helpful, and had lots of times to help us plan our outings. Nothing was too much for them to do. From the door staff, to the front of house, to the concierge, all were amazing. My wife said the bed was the most comfortable she has ever slept in, great as she was 17 weeks pregnant. They wrote us a message on the mirror for our 2nd year wedding anniversary and left us a cake in the room. They really made it extra special. The design of the hotel is amazing, we particularly liked the bar area, the lighting and atmosphere were great and the staff very attentive.  It is a stunning location. Would recommend this to anyone travelling to Barcelona. Many thanks Cotton House, Rob and Rebecca",5,2022,02,20
13,A Unique Gem in the Heart of the City,"I recently spent two weeks at the Cotton House in Barcelona. The staff was amazing, from Mario at the front desk and Christina & Nicolas at the Concierge to Mara in housing and the bellmen, they were all a delight. 

The hotel itself is situated close to Passeig de Gracia which has tons of store, eateries and is a lively part of the city. Within a 20min walk most of the city is at your fingertips. 

I was able to use Marriott Suite nights to upgrade to a junior suite. The room was up to date, spacious and the bed very comfortable. The wood floors added extra character to the room.  

The 1st floor lounge was incredibly unique. Do yourself a favor and have a drink in the library! They have decent wine list and a full bar with a diverse selection of spirits. 

The gym is in a tiny room so if you’re looking for an intense workout you’ll need to go elsewhere. Fortunately, the concierge team was very helpful and directed me to a gym that was a 2min walk from the hotel. 

Hotel WiFi worked well (doesn’t always) which make ‘working from home’ a breeze. 

All in all a wonderful stay. I’ve stayed at a variety of Marriott brand properties in Barcelona and while they were all okay, Cotton House is the one I would recommend the most.",5,2022,02,12
13,Magical Boutique 5 Star with a Heart,"Cotton House is an exceptional 5 star boutique hotel in a central location of Barcelona, close to transportation, high end and casual eateries, shopping and many key tourist spots.  The restaurant and terrace area are a designer's dream, and the rooms are calm, modern and unique.  
The best part of Cotton House is the staff.  I ended up having to stay here for 3 weeks because my daughter needed foot surgeries after a fall.  The staff went out of their way to help her, lending us a wheelchair, helping her in and out of taxis, bringing up a stool for the shower, and ice buckets on a regular basis to ice her foot.  The concierge helped design a private tour that could accommodate her handicap.  The staff in the lobby, including Carla, Alex, Reyes, Javier and Eddie were super helpful. Aitor, Emia, Fatima, Nabil (bartender who makes the best cocktails including La Ultima Palabra) and everyone else went out of their way to make me feel at home.  My apologies to all those who I have not named. You helped me at a trying time and made me fall in love with Barcelona. I will be back soon with my husband!",5,2022,02,04
13,Cotton House Hotel - Barcelona,"This is our second time staying at the Cotton House. We love the location. It's easy to get in and out of  Barcelona from here, especially during rush hour when the streets are teeming with motorcyclists weaving in and out of cars.

The hotel is lovely. It was originally a cotton house where nobility and well-known public figures had their garments made. Some original bolts of cotton cloth are on display.

The interior design includes original invoices, dating back to the 1800's, which have been used to paper the walls of the dining room!  So much history here. One gets to experience what life could have been like from a bygone era. 

Their buffet breakfast offers a very large selection of unique items such as lychees in syrup and homemade lemon cakes, among other patisseries and freshly baked breads. 

Reyes, the head porter/concierge, was very helpful with the large amounts of luggage that we were traveling with. He gave us great tips and information about the city. 

The beds are heavenly and the linens are all beautiful soft cotton, staying true to the hotel's namesake.

If you're looking for a quiet, boutique hotel, this is the place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2022,02,02
13,Best boutique 5 star in Bareclona,"Awesome experience at this brilliantly situated hotel only a couple hundred metres from Passeig Gracia with the main shops.   Attentive friendly smiling staff in all areas of the hotel.  It was celebration for my wifes birthday and they went the extra mile to make the day special.  Great restaurant and outside terrace and bar.  You know its good when locals arrive for lunch.  Rooms are small but perfectly furnished with the very best cotton throughout.  This is true 5 star service in beautiful surroundings , we will definitely return. ",5,2022,01,20

13,One of the best meals in barcelona,"Cotton house has seriously blew my mind, from the terrace to the service to every single meal we had
Everything was very impressive. We were served by Nabil a very nice and helpful waiter. Recommended",5,2022,01,14
13,Good choice in Barcelona but be mindful of your belongings!,"The stay would have been positively memorable if it wasn’t for one important issue: my pair of Sony XM4 headphones went missing. All I know is that I checked into the hotel with them, I never took them out of my room, and when I was packing to leave they were nowhere to be found. I tried to sort the issue with the reception desk who escalated to the housekeeping management. Nobody knows nothing. I’m shocked and disappointed, and no matter how nice the property is, I will always remember it as the hotel that ""lost"" me my headphones :( 

For the rest: good location (a stone's throw from the Sagrada Familia), beautiful ""old world"" lobby, great restaurant and breakfast buffet, nice room upgrade with a roomy shower and view to the Gran Via. It's a pity my stay had to end like this.",2,2022,01,13
13,A home away from home in Barcelona,"Not enough time or space to sing the praises of Cotton House, our home away from home during our trip to Barcelona. It is a beautiful hotel, originally the home of the Boada family. It now belongs to the Spanish cotton industry group, which leases it to the hotel.

Cotton House is beautiful - the rooms, the common areas, the restaurant, and the terrace. The staff cannot be nicer or more helpful. The food and drinks are delicious. They did an amazing job setting up and serving our New Year’s dinner for 15 at the hotel’s library. And they helped us with tests and printouts even after we had left the hotel.

I’m a big fan of the Majestic Hotel, but think I’ve found a new favorite one! Cannot recommend it enough! 

(By the way, it is the third Marriott Autograph Collection hotel I’ve stayed at since the summer, and they have not disappointed.)",5,2022,01,11
13,Amazing hotel with even more amazing staff!,"What you experience at the Cotton House Hotel is really just the best Marriott and especially the Autograph Collection has to offer. The place is truly unique - it offers not only amazing rooms (and suites) but also a great breakfast buffet and superb staff. This ranges from the Front Office Manager Olivia who is amazingly caring and friendly. The same applies to Mario and his colleagues at the front desk who made sure that I would have the room available earlier than 3pm. Reyes, who is the responsible bellman of the hotel, makes sure that you're welcomed in a super friendly manner and takes care of your every need!
To sum it up, it's my 3rd time at the Cotton House Hotel and I must say it definitely has become my favorite go to hotel in Barcelona! Highly recommended!",5,2022,01,03
13,Disappointing Stay,"I will preface this review by saying that I have travelled extensively, and while I have high expectations, I am generally able to overlook a few missteps. I had high hopes for this hotel, given its history and publicity. From a design perspective, it is beautifully done, with well-curated spaces throughout. During our stay, it had the added ambiance of being decorated for Christmas. My only gripe from an aesthetics standpoint would be that some of the spaces are quite dark, to the point of us barely being able to see each other at breakfast one morning. Unfortunately, the major drawback of this property, and the reason I wouldn’t return, is the overall lack of service, which falls far short of a property of this category. This hotel appears to have hired most of their staff from outside of a Spain, which is problematic for a few reasons. First off, many of the staff do not speak Spanish, which just felt quite odd to me. Secondly, the property lacks the usual friendly, service-focused mentality that is experienced nearly everywhere else in Spain. The service was cold and impersonal. The overall sense we experienced throughout our stay, was that the staff acted as if they were doing us a favour each time we made a request. Check-in was ok, however we were only offered a glass of water, and not given much of an explanation of the property. We did not receive a room upgrade or late checkout despite our Marriott status and being AMEX platinum cardholders. We only discovered the restaurant and patio up one floor from the lobby when we went searching them out. Breakfast was consistently poor; we noticed many guests similarly frustrated by how long things were taking, and the staff themselves seemed overworked and burnt out. This is despite many of the guests opting for the buffet, so I’m not quite sure what was so burdensome to the staff. The hostess was frantically running around filling water glasses and taking orders in addition to seating guests. The rooms, while again beaidiful, suffer from a lack of sufficient storage, with only 1 small closet with sliding doors that is difficult to access. There is also only a small set of drawers, with 2 of them occupied by the safe and bar equipment. We stayed in one of the largest rooms and still found it difficult to store our clothing and luggage. The one major selling point of the rooms is the beds. They are extremely large, comfortable, and outfitted with beautifully soft linens. The property sells many of their items including the towels, toiletries etc, however when we enquired about the sheets no one knew where they could be purchased. While a small misstep, this is not typical for a property of this caliber. The competition in Barcelona is strong, with the Ritz Palace and Almanac both just a block away. Both of those properties have far higher service levels and surpassed our experience here.",2,2021,12,26
13,Stunning hotel!,Absolutely stunning hotel! Could not get enough of the deco and beautiful restaurant and library room! Special thanks to doorman Reyes who was always warm and welcoming and made us feel special. Our room was spacious and the beds were amazingly comfortable!,5,2021,12,17
13,Highly recommend,We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel. It has a classic yet modern feeling. The rooms are very pretty and the restaurant is delicious. The staff was very nice and helpful especially Nabil and Reyes. Great location too- we walked all over town from there.,5,2021,12,10
13,Favorite hotel!,"We stayed at the Cotton House Hotel for five nights and loved everything about this boutique property. The staff, dining, rooftop, room, historic features, location, etc. Deni was our server on several occasions and we so appreciated her. Thanks to all! Highly recommend and will stay here again.",5,2021,11,28
13,These stellar reviews are spot on for a reason,"In my mind, there is no better place to stay in Barcelona. From the second we approached the Cotton House Hotel we were greeted by the friendly doorman and front desk staff. Everyone smiles and engages you because they want to make sure you have the best experience possible. You can tell the staff loves their jobs because all they want to do is show you around the hotel and make sure your every need is met. The restaurant staff, the bartenders are also incredibly nice.

The hotel is impeccably clean and LOVELY, especially the decor! I wish we could live there. If you want a very quiet room, I suggest room 302. It’s located overlooking the restaurant patio. It was so quiet, I would have thought we were sleeping in a bank safe. But every morning we would walk onto the balcony and enjoy the sunshine and smells of Barcelona.

The hotel is about a 15 minute walk to the Gothic quarter, Sagrada Familia and pretty much everything you want to see, so the location is great. 

Do yourself a favor and stay here.",5,2021,11,25
13,Decent hotel with great location,"Over all, this is a hotel you will be happy with. The rooms could do with some renovations and new furniture at least. However, very good location, wonderful terrace and great staff. Reyes was very helpful and kind to us. The breakfast was very good also.",4,2021,11,14
13,?,"Great place. Lovely spot and style. All around, a great place.

Particularly great staff at reception, concierge,  the bar and Reyes.

Breakfast included sadly didn't include hot food. So you have to pay extra. For a not inexpensive hotel that seemed disappointing. Otherwise I would have given 5stars.",4,2021,11,11
13,"Convenient, elegant and quiet hotel. Splendid breakfast! Amazing staff.","We had a splendid time in Barcelona and the Cotton House was a perfect place to stay. The staff is very accommodating and friendly. Gino, Javier, rise and the young gentleman on  the evening shift were all helpful and extremely polite. We had a room on the sixth floor overlooking the courtyard.",5,2021,11,03
13,Unique hotel with wonderful staff,"People are wonderful and that is what makes this hotel. It is a lovely little place. Beds are comfortable, location is great.  I was disappointed I didn’t get any room upgrade (Ambassador) but the room itself is nice tho noisy. Lots of weird noises - sounds like water being poured in toilet several times and street noise kept me awake.  That said - I would still select this hotel. Recommend ear plugs (if they work for you) or ensure you have a room away from the street.  Had breakfast and Tapas in Batuar - great service and lovely terrace.",4,2021,10,28
13,Fantastic stay at this wonderful hotel.,"I can't even begin to say enough about our recent stay at this hotel. From the moment you walk in it has the wow factor. They kept much of the original house on the first two floors. They have kept the old world vibe but added modern touches to the décor to make the hotel feel old and new at the same time.
The staff was wonderful and they helped with every request we had. Reyes, the bellman was so helpful and his warm spirt was so welcoming. The food and cocktails were amazing. Please try the limoncello and order the lemon tart for desert. It was a work of art. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",5,2021,10,27
13,Mostly Amazing,"Our stay was mostly amazing. The hotel itself is gorgeous from lobby, to rooftop, to library. The front desk was so helpful and the bellhop Reyes particularly went above and beyond to help us out. Our room did have an ant infestation, otherwise I would have rated our stay 5 stars!",4,2021,10,23
13,A Solid Choice for AMEX FHR in Barcelona,"Review:

High Points: the theme of cotton uniquely carried out throughout the hotel, the library rooms for drinks, the decor of the indoor bar and surrounding tables, the bathrooms with separate shower, tub, toilet, and sink areas

Low Points: breakfast had no green tea (""at least not today sir"" the breakfast staff told me); the QR codes on the tables outside reflect only a tapas and bar menu, but a fuller menu WAS available which we realized when watching other tables offer different food options, and only then  Vincenzo told us that other options were available from other menus; nobody on check-in morning or afternoon staff spoke decent Spanish- we conducted all of our conversations in English to try to accomplish anything; reaching the wall-mounted bath products from the tub is impossible, and serving them even MORE impossible... how do you pump bath soap into a tub when it's in a container on the wall on the opposite side of the room? (room 601); world-famous Spanish hot chocolate comes in packets of CC chocolate to make yourself--if you can find hot water; upon check-in we confirmed an amenity of a guaranteed late 1600 checkout; on departure day front desk called us at 12 asking if we needed assistance with our luggage for our 1400 checkout, yet we confirmed again our check-out at 1600; I left an item in the library (my mistake) and nobody from housekeeping lost and found aided me in recovering it; the complimentary small bottles of water in-room you can use for Nespresso machine, tea kettle, or drinking but only ONE of those choices

Unique Points: the rickety floors, the Concierge who sits alone on a table for 12 in the middle of the 1 floor, Reyes from the Caribbean made a wonderful, personal impression to every guest (as many TA reviews attest here); breakfast coffee you make yourself from a machine that offers a few options; individual bamboo tongs accompany each guest to all buffet choices; the breakfast cotton-candy waffles with dulce de leche is a real treat with the theme of the hotel

F&B Big Threes:
Food: gourmet twist on modern tapas
Service: a bit clumsy at breakfast and a bit understaffed at the popular dining hours
Ambience: outside with hotel guests looking down on diners from their rooms",3,2021,10,21
13,Hotel Guest,"We loved our stay at the beautiful Cotton House. Reyes provided a warm, sunny, and helpful welcome and was so kind to us. Such a lovely and historic setting to frame our trip to Barcelona. We would stay there again!",5,2021,10,20
13,Perfect Location and Beautiful historic hotel,"The Cotton House Hotel is a lovely former cotton manufacturing building turned into a hotel. It has every bit of the historical charm that I love to stay in while visiting Europe and had a great central location between the Eixample and Gotic neighborhoods - making it super easy to see the main sights and having tons of great dining options within walking distance.  

Our room was decorated with fine cotton images, backlit, which made for a super cosy morning or late evening lighting.  It also had a good size terrace overlooking the patio, which was lovely to listen to the sounds of the evening. Everything was immaculate, clean, and well taken care of. 

Breakfast was very good, with a variety of fresh fruit, meats, cheeses, cakes, and breads.  It is served on the patios outside - a perfect place to drink coffee and enjoy the morning. 

Service was fantastic - over our four night stay - many behind-mask smiles greeted us and they took care of our every need.  Unfortunate I can’t remember his name, but he was an intern from the Netherlands was especially fantastic. 

Would recommend staying here - for Marriott members looking for a hotel - this is way better located than the W to the historical sights and to great dining options in the evening.",5,2021,10,16
13,Our stay in Cotton House,"Perfect stay with super crew! We enjoyed every minute of our stay : beautiful rooms, nice rooftop, friendly crew and excellent location. We can recommend everyone the Cotton House Hotel. Nothing negative to mention…",5,2021,10,15
13,The perfect stay with perfect hospitality,"Everything about this hotel is top notch.  The property is beautiful, well appointed, and luxurious.  The restaurant, public spaces, and rooms are beautiful.

At the very end of out stay, Reyes came to out rescue, hailing a cab, fixing a broken bag handle, and getting us off to the airport on time.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ all the way.",5,2021,10,14
13,Great hotel.,"Just want to leave the message, sending huge appreciation towards the staff Reyes.  He has helped me out with my personal assistance need perfectly before my flight, and I greatly appreciate it.  Reyes you are the best. Thank you. :)

Room 404 - Yui",5,2021,10,01
13,Excellent venue,"Excellent venue and location in the Eixample district. Staff is absolutely fantastic in particular Reyes, who warmly and briefly explained to us the main features and history of the Hotel. The patio snd restaurant staff and facilities made a difference too. Room 101 is definitively a big 10/10. Thanks Cristina for the change!",5,2021,09,29
13,Boutique luxury hotel with an awesome staff,"This boutique luxury hotel is very well located with an awesome team running it. The main level lounge, restaurant, and terrace were beautiful. The staff absolutely wonderful. They were genuinely invested in assuring our visit was special. The front desk staff (extra special thanks to Laura), the doormen, the servers, as a whole were the very best I’ve ever experienced in all my travels. The guest rooms were a little worn and might benefit from the level of luxury that exists throughout the rest of the hotel. That being said, I would return here again without question.",5,2021,09,26
13,Reyes is the man!,"From the minute Reyes greeted us at the door, we had a fantastic stay. The hotel is beautiful, quiet, and comfortable. The staff is amazing and friendly.

We were undecided between a city view or courtyard view. We ended up with the courtyard view on the top floor which was amazing. From the pool, you can see the Sagrada Familia, but not sure if you would be able to see it from any lower floors with a city view.",5,2021,09,22
13,Wonderful Stay,"I had the most wonderful stay at cotton house in early August. I stayed here back in 2018 and returned because of the great location and unbelievably comfortable beds.  The whole cotton house team was incredibly helpful, but Reyes went above and beyond.",5,2021,09,12
13,While in Barcelona,"Excellent property, centrally located, comfortable and spacious rooms.  The bed comfort allows the guests to have pleasant and restful night. I highly recommend the property for a leisure or business trip.",5,2021,09,07
13,One of the best hotels we ever stayed at,"Barcelona is one of our favourite cities in the world, but at times it can be quite hectic, warm and some times even a little smelly. 

That’s why we LOVED coming home at this hotel. It smells so fresh and clean, every single corner is beautifully decorated, the temperature in the rooms is perfect and the staff is calm, kind and will not give you no as an answer. Reyes was our favourite staff member with his kind smile, eye for detail and attentive service. 

Regards Katya & Robert",5,2021,08,30
13,What an amazing experience!,"What an amazing experience! We travel a lot and always choose nice hotels but this one is on top of our list. The staff is simply amazing. We were welcomed by Reyes who is like the host that shows you around upon arrival. I never experienced a welcoming like that! The building is simply stunning and the rooms very nice. The bed, pillows and sheets are out of this world and the products like shower gel and shampoo are exceptional. The restaurant is very good. Breakfast is impressive. A lot of choice and everything fresh and homemade. For dinner everything is local but Michelin-star level in my opinion. There is a valet service which is super easy when you have a rental car. After checking out we found fresh bottles of water in our car with a goodbye note and a cotton ball on a little branch. This closed off a phenomenal stay in BCN. We will certainly come back!",5,2021,08,26
13,Beautiful hotel and city,"If you love old traditional interiors with a modern twist then this is for you. All the luxury and modernity in a stunning refurbished building. Breakfast in a courtyard or swim on the roof with views of the city !!!
Swift service from everyone and made to feel very welcome . Thanks to Reyes fir service with a huge smile !!
I will be returning .",5,2021,08,26
13,"Beautiful hotel, stunning service.","We booked this hotel blind for a last minute extension to a holiday in Girona. We hit gold, what a beautiful hotel. From the second we pulled up outside we saw it was somewhere special, and in a great location, right by Passage de Gracia and the boutiques/shops, also very close access to all the tourist spots, the Gaudi buildings, including Sagrada Familia and the Open Top Bus routes etc.

The hotel is beautifully appointed, the original design features excellently restored and used and from the front door onwards, the impression is of superb quality and old-school glamour and splendour, the hotel does not feel 5 years old, it feels brand new, but also 100years old. The staff reflect that impression (the quality of service, not being 100yrs old!), two amazing young ladies behind receptions, both speaking perfect English, wouldn’t let us do anything before pouring us a glass of Cava. Then a second glass whilst they processed our check-in. We felt immediately like 1950’s Hollywood stars, the vibe of the hotel. They continued to be hugely helpful throughout our stay with recommendations on restaurant, bars, coffee shops, tourist attractions, etc.

The staff throughout the hotel were similarly superb, the dining room and bar staff, housekeeping, everyone dressed immaculately in a uniform befitting the generation of the hotel. 

The ‘bell boy looked like he had stepped out of a late-19th Century Cotton Plantations owners Manor House. Immaculately dressed and clearly immensely proud of the hotel as he gave us a guided tour and explained the long history of the building and its recent life as a hotel. The 6-storey, roof hung spiral staircase takes your breath away, a real design feature, but the hotel is filled with them.

The Bataur restaurant is similarly superb. Beautiful inside, stunning outside - a lovely outdoor terrace where you feel transported back to times gone-by. The staff again are superb Every single member of staff was brilliant. Emma (an intern who started the day before we arrived!), Elisabet and Enia really stood out as brilliant, as did Lorenzo, but all staff were superb. We ate breakfast every day there, and ate dinner on three occasions, so greatly did we enjoy it.

The rooms were great, if we were to highlight a weakness, the rooms are small as with most city centre hotels. Our 30m2 ‘Egyptian’ room was very tight for three of us and the rooms, whilst spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated, did not quite reach the level of ’newness’ the rest of the hotel attained, but more a reflection of the hotel, than the rooms. Furthermore, the Hotel Manager soon found us a more suitable solution. 

Overall we loved our stay, and would’t hesitate to return here on our next trip to Barcelona.

PS - one great tip, hire a YEGO scooter, brilliant way to see the city!",5,2021,08,23
13,Perfect Stay in Sant Pere!,"We spent four nights at the Cotton House Hotel at the end of July 2021 and absolutely loved our stay! We are Platinum Elite Marriott Bonvoy members, and they did a double upgrade for our room, which was ready for us by the time we checked in! We had a Cotton Deluxe Guest Room, with a balcony that overlooked the courtyard.  We drank espresso every morning on that balcony, before enjoying breakdown downstairs on the terrace! 

The staff saw to every need! They were incredibly responsive and helpful, and made our stay incredibly enjoyable! I especially loved having breakfast on the terrace every morning.  The location was ideal, as it was close to everything we love in Sant Pere, but still in a quiet neighborhood.  Definitely also recommend hanging out at the rooftop pool. 

Everyone with whom we were in contact, from the front desk staff, to people helping us with the breakfast buffet and happy hour, to Reyes with summon a cab for us, was warm, friendly, professional! 

We have already booked our next stay and cannot wait!",5,2021,08,22
13,5 star decor/comfort with 4 star service,"Wonderful location, gorgeous decor, incredibly comfortable bed! Less than stellar pool (it’s tiny!) and really hard to find chairs up there.

The service was 4 stars (va 5 star hotel). The soap in my room was empty and the lotion was open/used from the previous guest. Often, there was no staff at the pool to get towels.

Difficulty finding bell-hop, someone to help get a taxi, housekeeping, etc. Most stuff was very kind and apologetic. 

I’d stay here again but hopefully after the pandemic they can increase staffing to help provide a 5-star experience.",4,2021,08,22
13,"Amazing, especially Reyes!","I had a great time at this hotel, but the best part was when Reyes gave me some cotton with the signature smell to take back home with me. A great memory with a great team. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in Barcelona for a nice trip.",5,2021,08,21
13,Amazing hotel,"Great hotel! Would def come back here on my next trip to Barcelona as close to all the shops and restaurants. Really friendly and attentive service and front desk staff, , and especially Reyes! He was always there to help!",5,2021,08,18
13,Great Hotel!!! You won’t be dissapointed,"Our stay in Cotton House was simoly excelent! The hotel is beautiful and rooms are super comfortable. The restaurant in the first floor “Batuar” is a MUST, the food is delicious!! One of the best restaurants we went to in the cuty. The staff is very kind and attentive, and I want a give a huge shoutout to Reyes, eho helped us with our bags, finding taxis and recommending olaces to go. If you’re looking for a good experience in Barcelona, Cotton House will do just that!",5,2021,08,10
13,Fantastic stay in Barcelona,This hotel is very boutique.  It is a lovely place to stay. We were greeted with a glass of Champagne upon check-in.  The service at the hotel bars and restaurants are excellent. Housekeeping is wonderful and the rooms are spacious.  The breakfast is both ala carte and buffet so there is a choice.  I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to couples traveling here.,5,2021,08,09
13,Would stay again!,Everyone was awesome!  They spoke perfect English and even helped me communicate with my broken Spanish. There was a young woman (can’t remember her name) who could be the greatest greeter I have seen at a property and Reyes outside was great!,5,2021,08,05
13,One of a kind,"One of the best in Autograph collection, the decor is Indo French style reminded me the furniture we used to see in Old Madras and Pondicherry in India. Rooms are clean but we were not given adequate towels but they were provided after we asked for it. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful.  Patio and restaurant are very beautiful and the ambiance is fantastic. Food is relatively cheap and good quality.  Location is great and you can walk to almost most of the attractions. Overall my experience is great and I recommend this hotel for your stay at Barcelona.",4,2021,08,04
13,Historically Beautiful,The hotel is very beautiful and you can clearly tell it is historic. Staff was wonderful and nice especially Reyes was great with helping us with luggage when we were checking out. Rooms are a bit small with no storage so keep that in mind when staying . Also they do not give you that many towels or pillows but if you ask you can get more. The outdoor terrace is beautiful but it closed at 12:30pm which was a bit annoying cause I could have stayed there much later enjoying the atmosphere.,4,2021,08,03
13,Perfect Location-Above & Beyond Customer Service-A MUST for travelling to Barcelona,"Attention all USA travelers to Barcelona…If you desire an amazing hotel that is in the heart of everything and want to feel safe and treated with first class service, then book your stay at the Cotton House Hotel

My wife, 10-year old son, and I researched our family vacation to visit family in Vienna, Austria in July of 2021 and found that we could save significant dollars on each ticket flying through Barcelona.  In previous, years, the tickets were less expensive to fly through London, but this time around we decided Spain was our choice.  Our trip consisted on a 1-day layover in Barcelona on the front end of the trip followed by 4-days on the back-end.  Being a Marriott Bonvoy Member, I opted to book my family at a Marriott property, but we did not want to stay near the water at the W Hotel, so we looked at all of the things we wanted to do, sight-see and visit while in Barcelona and then select a hotel not too far away to minimize cab fares.  The Cotton House Hotel on Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, 670 offered an amazing location so we booked a 1-night stay and then a 4-night stay for our trip.

Upon arrival, we were initially greeted by REYES, a friendly bell hop.  When our taxi from the airport stopped in front, he assisted us with our luggage and got us to the reception area.  This was not our only interaction with REYES, as we bumped into him several times throughout our trip.  He politely held doors, offered us water (it was hot in July), and offered to hail taxis for us too.  As our first point of contact, REYES, offered us a welcoming smile and spoke both English and Spanish (we speak both too).

The next highlight, goes to MARIO, the front desk attendant.  MARIO was overly-friendly, checked us in quickly and gave us maps of the city.  He explained all of the hotel policies, restaurants, cleaning, and safety precautions.  He was our second point of contact and so very helpful in getting us situated and feeling welcome as this was our first trip to Spain.  After a long day visiting the Soccer Stadium, we returned to the lobby and MARIO again greeted us, complimented us on our new FC Barcelona attire and offered recommendations for dinner including the hotel restaurant too.

We accepted the recommendation and next found ourselves at Batuar, the hotel restaurant on the 1st floor.  ELLE, our server, was very attentive, made us feel welcome and answered all of our food-related questions.  ELLE finished out our first day by bringing us dessert and our bill which was quite affordable.  Our first night in Barcelona ended with huge smiles on our face and left us anxious to return at the backend of our European vacation.

Upon our return to Barcelona the following week, we again saw MARIO, but this time, we were assisted with check-in by a young lady, MARGUBA.  In my opinion, MARGUBA is the ultimate, extreme definition of amazing and over the top customer service.  I travel for my employer regularly, and I can say with 100% confidence that MARGUBA is the most efficient and amazing front office manager I have ever encountered.  From hailing taxi’s, offering waters, answering tourist questions, and simply giving just a smile (from behind a mask of course), MARGUBA helped make our stay enjoyable.  Since we were returning to the USA, we needed to locate a clinic that offered COVID testing.  We knew that we needed one within 72 hours of departure so we figured we could walk-in somewhere and pay for a test.  We asked MARGUBA if she knew of a place and with a concerned look on her face, she asked if we made any  appointments as places in Barcelona are not as plentiful as we are used to in the USA.  When we said no, she offered to call a local doctor who was coming to the hotel the following day for another guest, but she offered to call us once she could confirm the test results would arrive before we left.  This is where the best customer service people shine…MARGUBA recognized the look of concern on my face as it was late in the day and we needed to have the results returned before we left 2 days later.  She looked me right in the eyes and said, “Please sir do not worry about this COVID test, I am going to personally see to it that you and your family find a place to take the test and get your results in time.  Go back to your room, get cleaned-up and I will call you shortly with answers.”
Very rarely do you see hotel employees go above and beyond for guests, but MARGUBA followed up on her promise.  She located a clinic 20-minutes away that was open for 1.5 more hours and requested me to round-up my family and she would assist in getting a taxi and inform the driver where to take us.  When we arrived downstairs a few minutes later ready to go, she jumped out from behind the desk, walked outside and halfway up the block whistling and waving for a taxi to come.  She gave the driver the address and we were on our way.

When we returned to the hotel a few hours later, we thanked her for her help and support.  She went over the top helping us in our time of need and it is for this reason, I will tell anyone reading this review, that the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona hires amazing staff members and trains them to put the guest first and ensure they have a hassle-free stay while in Barcelona.  I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling from the USA.  You will find all of the comforts of Marriott (comfy beds, free water, large bathrooms, good plumbing, lots of power outlets, a mini fridge, iron, robe and slippers, and a safe for valuables too).  You will also be greeted by a staff that embodies 100% customer satisfaction.

My family and I were so pleased with our visit (outside of the amazing city) that I could not wait to write this review.    We absolutely loved Barcelona and the charm the city showed to us, but our hotel stay was amazing and REYES, MARIO, ELLE, and MARGUBA deserve the highest accolades for a job well-done.  Next time we visit Barcelona, we will be sure to stay at the Cotton House again and I recommend you consider doing the same !!!  Thank you Marriott and Barcelona.  Hope to see you again soon.",5,2021,08,02
13,Repeatedly have great stays,"This is the second time we've come back over the years.  The staff are always fantastic - and especially Reyes who is a familiar face over the years: highly responsive and professional, always with a glowing smile on his face!  The room was a nice upgrade and the bed is heaven.  Our only recommendation would be for the hotel to up its game on toiletries - bath salts, etc would've been nice.  Instead, we had two ""bath gels"" and one ""conditioner"" on the wall.  Also, room had only one bathrobe and beach towel but I am sure had we requested a second set, they would've provided immediately.  Finally, the room service was excellent and the food truly fantastic.  The cheese plate and breads far exceeded our expectations for room service, as did the gourmet Salmorejo.  Vale!",5,2021,07,30
13,Wonderful stay in Barcelona ,"My wife and I stayed at the Cotton House Hotel for 4 nights during our first trip to Barcelona. The service was incredible from all the staff. Our favorite part was the breakfast on the terrace every morning. One evening my wife accidentally cut her finger and needed a bandage and some salt water and one of the service members rushed to our room so quickly, he was out of breath! Checkout was quick and easy and Reyes at the front desk even fetched a cab for us to the airport. From start to finish, it was an incredible experience. ",5,2021,07,27
13,Delightful Historic Hotel with Modern Convenience,"This is a delightful hotel with an excellent location.#
Greeted warmly by Marguba, she ensured that the trip was smooth and beyond expectations. The room was the beautiful Damasco Suite, which I recommend as an upgrade worth paying for. Huge room, high ceilings, amazing artistry and a romantic 4 poster. Oasis of a breakfast patio, awesome location and charming people.

What else do you need?",5,2021,07,20
13,"Excellent hotel to explore from, unwind and relax!","While the Cotton House facilities were top notch it was the staff that made the experience world class and exceeded our expectations.

The front desk staff was warm and welcoming. The front desk not only booked a great restaurant on the beach for my partner's birthday but also helped us address the miscommunication with a medical lab regarding our Covid test results for travel back to the United States.
 
Each morning we happily awoke to a breakfast team that were friendly and hospitable. The hostess would welcome us each morning by name. Servers would ask how our previous day’s adventure went while perfecting our morning coffee.

At dinner it was as equally enjoyable. The first dinner we had, our server paid amazing attention to us and told us about the history of the Cotton House. While during the second dinner, our server provided personal service that you would only receive at the finest restaurants welcoming us and remembering our food preferences from breakfast of the previous day.

While Barcelona by itself is memorable it was our stay at the Cotton House that made it magical.",5,2021,07,14
13,"Terrific Staff, Lovely Hotel and Great Location","My wife and I loved the Cotton House. Marguba and Aina from the front desk were amazing - so helpful. The breakfast area and pool deck were incredible. The breakfast was okay. They charge extra for hot items which we found odd. Our room was a little strange - separate rooms for the toilet and shower with a sink in the middle of the room. Overall, the hotel is beautiful and well located. The staff is excellent and makes up for any other shortcoming. We had a lovely stay.",5,2021,07,12
13,Best Staff Ever !!!,"Such a unique outstanding beautiful  hotel  , the experience and service is above 5 stars ! All the people who work at the Cotton House Hotel go above and beyond expectations  , they never fail to impress me , perfect example is Nabil who was so welcoming on my first few days of arrival and continues to impress me every day with little touches that make a big difference  , a wonderful friendly team member , nothing is too much trouble for Nabil , always dealing with guests with such professionalism and friendliness , such as oasis of tranquillity !!!",5,2021,01,17
13,Perfect Hotel for all We Want to Do in Barcelona-Redux,"We were excited to spend some time in Barccelona again and chose to stay at the Cotton House once more.  About an hour away frrom the airport but within walking distance to all we wanted to do in Barcelona, the Cotton House was waiting for us again.  The staff is superb.  They make us feel like home, ensuring we knew all of the amenities of the hotel, bar and restaurant hours, etc.

We enjoyed the bar several times during our stay, choosing light snacks with drinks served by the friendly Serena.

The bar and restaurant are open concept, but there were cozy corners inside and a patio outside for meal and drinks al fresco.

The rooms are a tad smaller than other Autograph's but this is always a function of the unique locations.  There was nothing small about all the in-room amenities and the decor.  As wonderful as we remembered it.

The concierge team is always ready to help with maps, making reservations, etc.

We were able to walk to the Cathedral, to Flea Market, to St. Catherine's market, the Gotic quarter, and to the Placa Catalunya easily from the Hotel.",5,2020,09,28
13,The hotel is stunning and the staff are fantastic,"Had a long weekend get away to Barcelona to see friends and stayed at the Cotton House.  Absolutely fantastic staff and the hotel in beautiful.  We had breakfast included in our rate, which was nicely done with a covid combo of items off a menu and a small buffet with disposable tongs.  The location cannot be beat in the center of the city, with most major sites an easy walk.  I will definitely stay here again.",5,2020,08,09
13,Wonderful Stay,"As soon as we arrived the service was top notch.  The bellmen met us at the cab as we got out and loaded the luggage onto a cart.  He was friendly and unobtrusive.  We walked to the front desk and everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  The young man who helped us was friendly and informative.  The bellmen helped us up to our room and upon entering he mentioned all the features in the room.  He was very friendly and professional.  The room was spacious and clean.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  All amenities in the room that you need. We opted for the breakfast in the morning. There was a nice selection on the buffet and in additon you can order breakfast.  The staff was so friendly each morning.  We also had lunch one day, and appetizers and drinks on another day.  We were very happy with the food and of course service.  We spoke to the concierge one day to have a car service to the airport on our last day.  I believe her name was Carla.  She was so friendly and gave us options on the services.  We were staying during the vamp of the Coronavirus.  So as it came near for us to leave we kept changing the time of our car service.  Carla was so accommodating for all the changes.  Each time we walked passed the concierge desk or front desk they always stop what they were doing to say hello or thank you for staying with us.  We loved the hotel.  The SERVICE was top notch.  And we are hard to please because we are in the hospitaliy field.  
Thank you Cotton House...we will be back again!",5,2020,03,18
13,Great Design Boutique,"Worth it to stay here just for the history and over all design. 

The location is great, close to Plaza Catalunya, so access to transport and Aerobus is easy. It is just off the main streets so its relatively quiet. 
Service is very good, friendly, genuine and they ask all the right questions to try to ensure you have a good stay. Most are proactive and will seek to your needs. I only stayed for a quick 1 night stay but felt this in their service nonetheless.

Bar is beautiful with great cocktails and service.

Rooms are very nice. Given the tighter space, it is very well laid out. Got an upgrade from Madras to Cotton with balcony, love the door separating bedroom with the bathroom area. Liked the separate shower/ toilet and sink area. Only design flaw is that towel hooks and racks for shower and bath are located inside the shower behind the door, as such after drying off you get your feet wet by stepping back into the shower to hang towel or bathrobe. If they could add hooks outside of the shower this would solve the biggest grievance I had.
Given the historic nature of the building, walls and floors are super thin, thankfully during my stay it wasnt very full or roudy so wasnt noisy. 

Check in and check out was clear and flawless. I would say would have been nice to have been told that the rooftop was closed due to seasonal/ weather reasons as well as spa services and concierge services should one need it, they have a pretty big dedicated concierge team on the second floor! 

Otherwise, definitely would return. Really enjoyed my stay.",5,2020,03,09
13,Perfect location,"The plan for our trip was to stay in the heart of Barcelona in a price/quality hotel. Due to the current situation, it was possible to see that the hotel was pretty quiet. The room was great, the design is wonderful, the breakfast was great and the staff was great too. Kudos to Tania at the front desk and Carla at the concierge, both were really hospitable and were happy to show us where to go and take our doubts. 

Only one down side was my last day, where I agreed to pay for late check out as my flight was not until 19:00. And as I just wanted to relax and enjoy the last couple of hours in the room, I put the do not disturb sign at the door. For my surprise, around mid day , the housekeeping kept ringing on my door, even open the door... I think this could have been avoided as I agreed the previous night to extend my check out till 3pm and agreed to pay. 
Nevertheless, we had a great stay.",5,2020,03,07
13,Fabulous place!!! ,"We didn’t stay at this hotel but our friends from Barcelona took us there for a tour. It’s so stylish and beautiful! The architecture of the building and the design of the interior are stunning. Fabulous vestibule, staircase, lounges, library, terrace and restaurant are the pleasure for the eye. Truly a great representation of an iconic 5-star hotel! Pure elegance and significance historically speaking! This is definitely an amazing place for a visit! ",5,2020,03,05
13,Stunning Hotel with Unbelievable Service,"I love Autograph Collection properties and the Cotton House is a perfect example of why. This historic building turned hotel sits in the heart of Barcelona and offers a unique experience with easy access and all the stunning benefits of Marriott hotels.

I arrived in the morning and was greeted very pleasantly as an Ambassador guest. My upgraded room would be available in an hour (10am) which was very acceptable to me and so I went to meet a friend for coffee. When we got back the room was ready and my bags were in the room. Due to Ambassador status we had free breakfast and a voucher for drinks in the beautiful bar or on the terrace. The next day I also received a bottle of wine, some tasty chocolates, and a note on the mirror! Really great show of ambassador recognition!

The room itself is not that large, but it's a historic property so that's sort of to be expected. The toilet was separated from the shower, which I like especially for getting ready in the morning as a couple. The shower was really nice (rain shower) and had all the great things like water pressure and warmth you might want. There were slippers and bath robes and good amenities. The bed was super comfy and the room was well appointed with nice furniture including even outside on the balcony. Everything in the room was perfect, unless you were looking for a big room.

Then the public spaces were even better. The roof deck with pool is so great both in day and at night, and the little touches like automatic glass sliding door, and extra plants for privacy make it even better. The downstairs area is so beautiful and historic, and the bar made great drinks in a lovely setting. Breakfast was filling and included everything from avocado to great cheeses. Couldn't have asked for more.

The real cherry on top was the service, staff remembered my name throughout the trip and were super fast to help at every chance they had. I knew I was taken care of from the moment I stepped on the premises. Cannot wait to return to this property! Definitely my favorite place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2020,03,03
13,Unbelievable Stay,"My wife and I stayed here the last 2 nights.  Overall incredible.  Upon arrival we were greeted by many friendly smiling faces and treated like VIP’s.  Hotel is beautiful.  We got a very nice tour of the building by Fernando who was very nice and informative.  Everyone was super nice but especially Marguba behind the desk.  Tremendous attention to detail and we have never had such fantastic service and kind greetings and we have stayed at many, many hotels.  Sunny bar/ restaurant area was a delight and outside terrace was fantastic for an early evening drink.  Can’t wait to come back.",5,2020,03,01
13,All about the service,"I had only 24 hours to spend in Barcelona and was lucky enough to stay here.
The location is very convenient with all the coffee shops, bars, bakeries etc... you need within a short walking distance. Beautiful rooms, so comfortable, great beds etc..., rich and varied breakfast, beautiful rooms, lobby, etc... small pool on the roof (too cold for February though). 
To top it up is the service of all staff, from cleaners, to concierge, to reception, to bar to restaurant staff, all smiling, helpful, cheerful. My flight was at 2100 and when I asked for a late checkout they really tried to help as much as they can, not the usual sorry can not you often hear at many hotels. 
STAY HERE",5,2020,02,27
13,Outstanding customer service!,"I stayed at the hotel with my daughters and their friend for 4 nights in February 2020. The hotel is very centrally located, the lobby, library, restaurant and other common areas are very tastefully decorated and the rooms are very nice without being over-the-top. But what makes the hotel stand out is the warmth and helpfulness of every single person, from the front desk, to the bellmen, to the concierge to the restaurant and room service staff.  All of them went the extra mile to provide us with help during out stay and always with a sincerity and warmth that is unusual in the hospitality industry.  The breakfast, while relatively expensive, is one of the best I’ve had anywhere in the world.",5,2020,02,22
13,Best customer service,"My family of three loved our stay at this hotel.  Firstly, their customer service is one of the best I've experienced in any hotel. Secondly, when I checked into my hotel my 2 year old son had a fever. The hotel arranged for a doctor to visit our son in our room free of charge. Within 30 minutes of checking into the hotel, a doctor was present and saw my son and provided us with a prescription for his medicine. Thirdly, since I was there for my 40th bday and my son's 2nd bday, the hotel provided us with a free room upgrade and a free bottle of champagne and dessert. Fourthly, their breakfast, included with our room, was phenomenal. The hotel is located in the heart of the city. The rooms are spacious, clean and beds are very comfortable.",5,2020,02,20
13,Great hotel!,We really enjoyed our visit to the Cotton House in Barcelona. It is well situated to important tourist sites. The food at breakfast was excellent. The staff was very helpful and cheerful. The concierges were especially wonderful. We also enjoyed the friendliness and hospitality of Reyes every day.  We would certainly stay at this hotel again.,5,2020,02,19
13,Absolute Best Service in Barcelona,"I spent two wonderful nights at the Cotton House. Although the hotel, rooms, and location are all spectacular, what truly makes this property so very special is the staff. Every single staff member I encountered went above and beyond in their duties. You can tell that they all really enjoy their work and enjoy what they do. My trip to Barcelona from the US started out badly in that my flight was delayed almost 8 hours and my cousin’s flight was delayed 24 hours. Christina and Heidi went above and beyond in making sure our transportation from the airport was rescheduled and that our rooms were ready for us when we arrived. It was so nice to not have to worry about the details because these ladies were on it!  Once I did arrive, I was greeted warmly by Julian. He was so nice and welcoming and made me feel like I was at my home away from home. Every time I saw him throughout the rest of my stay he addressed me by name and asked how my day was. I’m not sure how many guests were staying at the hotel but he always remembered my name and other guests’ names as well. He also knew that it was my cousin’s birthday and he not only greeted my cousin by name but also wished him a happy birthday! Finally, Tommy the concierge, again went above and beyond. He, like Julian, always remembered my name and had wonderful dining suggestions. In fact, on my cousin’s birthday he recommended a wonderful restaurant and made us a reservation while we were talking to him. After we left, he called the restaurant back to let them know that we were celebrating a birthday. We had no idea he did this until the restaurant brought out complimentary champagne and cake and sang Happy Birthday to my cousin!  

If you have the opportunity to visit Barcelona, please, please, please treat yourself and stay at the Cotton House. There are so many wonderful hotels around the world, and I’ve been very fortunate to stay at a few of them, but the Cotton House tops my list because of the incredible people that work there.  The friendly, professional, and downright incredible staff made our stay a truly unforgettable experience. I look forward to returning to Barcelona just so I can stay here again!

Thank you Cotton House for a remarkable and unforgettable vacation!",5,2020,02,06
13,"Cotton House Hotel, Autograph Collection","The Cotton House is a five-star hotel that brings back the elegance of a time gone by and romanticizes high society at the turn of the 20th century. As a guest here, you’ll understand the grace, refinement and elegance of this period.

A landmark by architect Elies Rogent, this was originally a two-story home built in 1879 for a prominent family. Four floors were added some years later when it became the headquarters of the Catalan Association of Cotton Manufacturers. Original architectural elements like the master staircase have been retained.

The Cotton House Hotel has successfully captured history and blended 21st century service, cuisine and amenities to meet the demands of today’s clients. Luxurious carpeting line the hallways. Leather padded doors keep noise out. From branded soaps, bath salts and lotions in your bathroom, to the plush linens, robes and slippers by your bed, staying here is an experience that touches all your senses. 

Batuar, the hotel’s sophisticated bar and restaurant, offers house-created Mediterranean selections and beverages using the finest ingredients. There’s a delectable breakfast menu of unrivaled pastries, cakes and crepes.

On display in the restaurant are beautiful original bolts of cotton used in the trade while 19th century client invoices have been used to paper the walls. In keeping with the building’s heritage, each guest bedroom offers a selection of cotton cloth samples from which you can order creations made by master couturiers today.",5,2020,02,02
13,Wonderful location - easy access to everything,"My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House over New Years and it was the perfect location to get around many of the sites in Barcelona.  The staff was polite and helpful, the rooms clean, quiet and spacious.  Every meal we had in the restaurant was fantastic.  We easily would stay at the Cotton House again - highly recommend!",5,2020,01,26
13,Barcelona trip - Winter Getaway,"The Cotton House hotel is an elegant boutique property under the Marriott Bonvoy umbrella. The hotel used to house a textile company. In fact, you can get a shirt tailor-made during your stay. 

The hotel exudes old classic elegance from the lobby to the dining area. The rooms were a good size for couples. We were upgraded to an Egyptian room which had a desk, couch, and balcony.  

Location can’t be beat. We were less than 10 min walk to the main area Passeig Gràcia. You can find rows of designer shops, cafes, restaurant. Public transportation is easily accessible. 

The best part of course is the amazing staff  Highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona.",5,2020,01,22
13,Staff and service,I can’t say enough about how helpful and amazing the staff from front desk to restaurant and especially the concierge desk were! They went above and beyond for all requests no matter how big or small! Friendly and knowledgeable!,5,2020,01,19
13,A+,"Hotel was perfect. Beautiful, spacious room with a small balcony. Helpful and attentive staff. Beautiful bar and amazing breakfast to start off your day. Centrally located. The concierge provided fantastic dinner recommendations. I plan on making this my go-to for stays in Barcelona.",5,2020,01,18
13,Wonderful!,"I could not have had better service in Barcelona!  My friend and I picked the Cotton House because we are Marriott rewards members.  We went to Barcelona to get my daughter situated in her apartment while studying in the city.  The moment we walked in the front entrance we were welcomed with glasses of Cava, warm greetings and smells that instantly makes you relax and feel at home.  I give the staff at the door, desk, restaurant and concierge desk 5 stars. Every person was friendly and enthusiastic about making sure our experience in Barcelona was excellent.  Every recommendation for dinner and tours exceeded our expectations. The breakfast that was included offered both cold items and delicious hot items that can be ordered off the menu.   The location is perfect.  A Quick walk to all locations but just far enough away to avoid the crowds.

Thank you for making my week in Barcelona one of the best trips I have had!   Looking forward to coming back in April!",5,2020,01,18
13,One of the best ,"This was honestly probably as close to perfection as one can get to a boutique hotel. Everything, from the moment we checked in was faultless. We only regret not staying longer!

We arrived quite late and the check in was smooth and warm, especially since our route from the airport involved a rude and verbally abusive taxi driver. We were greeted straight away and was served a glass of sparkling to accompany our check in.

The bed is the BEST we have ever slept in, so much so that we asked the concierge for the manufacturer’s name. The room, is yes, a little small, but it was sufficient and it’s not like we were spending much time in the room anyway. The other linen was also clean and fresh.

The room we had (Room 511) also had four USB charging ports, but it was on the wall near the desk, so we asked for an adapter for the power point near our bed which was provided promptly (we had to return this upon check out).

But one of the best experiences at this hotel was that upon request and staff availability, the concierge staff are able to provide guests with a tour of the building which has a history of its own. This is truly an unique experience and I highly recommend this!

Thank you to the staff at Cotton House for making our last two nights in Barcelona so amazing! ",5,2020,01,17
13,Amazing experience in Barcelona,"My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House over the holidays. I can't say enough great thinkgs about our experience. The hotel is lovely and the common areas are very inviting. The Concierge stafff was wonderful to work with- Christina, Daniela and Vittoria all provided great recommendations on tours and restaurants. I would highly recommend this property to friends and family. The only downside is that our room while well appointed was on the small side. All the other perks definitely made up for that however.",5,2020,01,15
13,Holiday,"Amazing breakfast in hotel. Elise is really attentive, she takes care of the guest. Employee in desk are very nice. All time, they help us. Thank you for everything. L’hôtel is beautiful. Good emplacement in city. We come back.",5,2020,01,13

classic lounges. great location
great breakfast selection, bright room overlooking garden
quiet and peaceful
warm welcome",5,2020,01,12
13,"Amazing service, great location","We had an amazing experience all around at the Cotton House thanks to the wonderful people who work there.  We've been lucky to stay at many great hotels worldwide, and our experience here was probably the best, particularly given the very reasonable price point.  There are so many examples of the wonderful service but here are a few:

- Our mother-in-law arrived the night before we did and she is older and doesn't speak much English (or any Spanish).  Marguba helped her with check in, etc and my mother-in-law was very grateful for all our help.
- Our overnight flight arrived at 7am on a Sunday morning and we (along with other people we recognized from our flight) all arrived at the hotel ~8am.  Despite the many tired families, the staff worked very quickly to check everyone in and get them rooms despite it being well before check-in time.
- Unfortunately my wife was very sick upon arrival and we didn't leave the room for the first 2 days.  Several employees offered to call a doctor if needed or get medicine from the pharmacy if needed.  In particular, one of the concierges, Javier, was truly remarkable.  My wife had difficulty eating anything and Javier coordinated with the kitchen at the restaurant to cook some simple rice.  When my wife was somewhat better, Javier recommended several places nearby to eat, and all three we went to were great places.  Javier truly made a difference in our stay and we are very grateful to him.
Every person we interacted with was very helpful and cheerful and made the experience great.  We travel alot and this is rare to see.
Finally, the hotel was located in a great location on the Gran Via - close enough to the popular sites like Las Rambas, Placa Cataluyna, Gaudi buildings, etc, but also far enough to feel like you are in the real Barcelona.  And there are several small markets very closeby if needed.
We loved our stay at the Cotton House and will definitely be back.  Thanks to everyone who made our stay so memorable.",5,2020,01,04
13,Simply Spectacular,"This hotel is perfectly located, perfectly decorated and perfectly staffed. It was a fabulous experience and i will never forget the people and the place. Thanks to everyone there who made our stay so wonderful!",5,2020,01,01
13,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff !","This place was absolutely stunning. The architecture, the decorations, the rooms! Everything is super clean and beautiful! The staff is incredibly nice and helpful (seriously wonderful!), the restaurant is also beautiful and the terrace surrounds you with beautiful green plants and wonderful decorations. It was a wonderful place to stay! Not too far from the Sagrada Familia and from la Plaza Catalunya, it is pretty well located. ",5,2019,12,31
13,Beautiful interiors and great service in a charming hotel!,"My wife and I love this hotel! The decor in this cozy hotel is fabulous. An old textile headquarters converted to a lovely hotel in a relatively quiet area but close to many bustling areas and the old town section. Our room is a delight with a balcony facing a courtyard so it’s very private and quiet. The lighting, bed, and bath areas are well thought out ( although a free more drawers would be appreciated). The public spaces are beautiful. The service is awesome. Great concierge with multiple assistants. Christina helped plan our visit-very knowledgeable. The breakfast rooms are also very pleasant with delicious buffet and to order dishes including omelettes, crêpes, eggs etc. All well prepared and delisch!. We’ll be returning here to the Cotton House next week to visit the Sagradafamilia(Btw it’s a good idea to get tickets well before your visit if you want to go up the tower). 
Check out the package deals for the hotel on the  Bonvoy site or App. Sometimes the room plus breakfast is a better deal than just the room!",5,2019,12,29
13,"Good location boutique hotel , very cosy ","I stayed in Barcelona for 8 days , so I chose two hotels, W and Cotton House. As a Titanium member and I guess I have been upgraded to slightly bigger room. My friend was upgraded to corner room on the top floor as he was using standard rate to book while I am using prepaid rate.  There were some issues two weeks before I arrived as I used the prepaid rate as they were asking you to pay via email first although I rejected , but I guess you need to contact hotel to avoid cancellation.  This arrangement not required in W.  Having said that , the whole check in and check out experience was great and efficient,  I asked for help via two to three staffs to get taxi for other stuffs , they provided great and efficient help too.  The  breakfast was good while you need to pay extra for hot dishes, but the overall quality was good . Staff members was nice and generally pretty and smart , this is a plus for customers although people do not say it generally. Haha",4,2019,12,28
13,Best Hotel in Barcelona! By far!,"This Hotel is beautiful. Besides being in downtown Barcelona, you get to experience a different kind of Hotel. From the excellent room, to the Batuar Restaurant, Spa Suite and the best... the staff! They make your stay feel like a magic trip! I will sure stay there again! Ohhhhh, and the terrace... BEAUTIFUL!!!!",5,2019,12,27
13,Cotton House- lovely hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House for 3 nights this month. Very nice hotel. The room was small, but that's to be expected in the city. The interior was very unique and sophisticated. The location was excellent. It was walking distance to the beach and the main sites (like Sagrada Familia). We had breakfast at the restaurant and the staff was friendly and very helpful.",5,2019,12,18
13,Fantastic atmosphere,"We had a great time at the Cotton House Hotel.
The staff is really nice, friendly but still professional.
The whole hotel is fantastic from the room (quiet which was great to have a proper rest) to the restaurant, outdoor patio and common areas. Loved the restaurant for diner as well as for breakfast. The food is really good.
I liked the relaxed and cosy atmosphere. The place is a gem.
Thanks again.",5,2019,12,18
13,Excellent Service,"My wife and I spent 5 nights here in an Egyptian cotton room that we paid for primarily with points.  the trip was last minute, we had never been to Barcelona and we did very little pre-planning.  Nonetheless we had a great time because of the great service provided  by the hotel concierge staff (Daniela, Vittoria, Christin (?) etc) consistently went out of their way to help us and provide good suggestions on tours, restaurants and places to see.   What I will remember most about this hotel is the consistent high quality service provided by all employees. ",5,2019,12,11
13,Super Cool Property,"This converted old factory is worth seeing even if you don't stay there.  But stay there you should.  Outstanding and helpful staff, wonderful in-house restaurant and a really nice room.  The location is terrific - central but away from the crowds.",5,2019,12,10
13,24 hour Barcelona stay,"
My husband and I squeezed in a 24 hour trip from NYC to Barcelona this year in order to hit the next tier for our airline status. My Bonvoy ambassador recommended Cotton House to us as we were debating between this hotel, the Edition, and the Hotel Arts. I’m glad we took my ambassador’s advice! 

Taking the overnight flight into Europe is always dangerous. Who knows when your room is ready? After spending all night flying, we always show up jet lagged and crabby. Luckily, the hotel was able to upgrade us and have a room ready for a very early check in. It was so greatly appreciated. 

Our room was well appointed with gorgeous decor and the first comfortable mattress I’ve had in Europe! The room was completed with a small balcony overlooking a courtyard and the hotel’s restaurant. 

After a few hours of a nap and a shower, we were ready to explore. The hotel concierge Vittoria went out of her way to create a personalized walking trip in Barcelona for us! It was incredible! A few important churches, some romantic parks and plazas, the Picasso museum, a food market, and the Christmas market all were stops on our adventure. It was a wonderful gesture. 

We had some wine and snacks in the bar area before dinner. The restaurant and bar are gorgeously decorated (as is the hotel) and we almost debated staying for dinner if the concierge team hadn’t already gone through the trouble of securing us a Michelin Star dinner. 

Even though we stayed only one night, the Cotton House hotel felt like home. The entire team ensured that our total experience was absolutely perfect. We will make this hotel our permanent home away from home when we are in Barcelona. ",5,2019,12,08
13,"Great location, friendly staff",The Location of the hotel is great! But the best thing about the hotel is the staff. They’re so warm and welcoming! Special thanks to Orkhan from front desk and Manuel from breakfast. For sure my fist choice in Barcelona.,5,2019,12,08
13,Spot On...but,"Hotel has a decent location fo both business and tourists and spot on service from front desk (Juan), housekeeping and concierge (Javier, Cristina) and less so from restaurant and bar staff.  The rooms are very nice, the bed super comfortable; but there is some noise from other rooms and the terrace bar.",4,2019,12,05
13,5* disappointing ,"We booked this hotel having stayed at another autograph collection in Zurich expecting a phenomenal experience. The hotel is a five-star hotel so we expected a lot. Upon check-in service was fantastic. The property itself is gorgeous, old fashioned and modern at the same time. Location is great as well- 10 minute walk to the gothic section. Rooftop restaurant has a great atmosphere. Unfortunately we ended up disappointed. We walked into our room and noticed hair all over the bathroom on the floor but decided not to make too much of it. We went out for the day and when we came back we noticed they had turned down our room. Our extra key was missing and they left the garbage bag on top of my belongings on the desk. At this point I called down. They apologized and offered us a drink on the rooftop. The restaurant was empty and it took 25 minutes to get 2 glasses of champagne. I try hard not to give bad reviews but this was disappointment after disappointment for five star. The next morning we found something unsettling  on the bed. We called they sent someone up who brushed us off. We told the manager upon check out everything that happened and she was very apologetic and kept assuring us that a five-star hotel would not have these issues  but unfortunately that is not always the case. But the bottom line is that when you splurge on a 5 star, the service should be too. ",3,2019,12,01
13,Lovely Hotel,"I really enjoyed staying here the bed was comfortable room was really nice. It was a little close to the the courtyard bar but festivity’s there didn’t go on to late.
Breakfast was great good array of fine edible goodies and the service was very good
",5,2019,12,01
13,"Great Staff, Location and Experience",I several recommendations from friends that had stayed at the Cotton House in the past. To be honest most of their reviews undersold the experience.  The staff was very friendly and always greeted you with a smile. Reyes in particular would run up the street to get a taxi during busy traffic times. Easy walking distance from most downtown attractions. A must stay.,5,2019,11,23
13,Great hotel in a great location,"WE had a wonderful time in Barcelona and staying at the Cotton House helped.  The staff and service are excellent.  They are so friendly and can't do enough for you.  Danielle at the Concierge Desk was especially helpful.  Our first day there she sat down with us and explained the layout of the city, and what to see in each section. Also our room was great.",5,2019,11,20
13,First Class,"relatively small Hotel, now part of Marriott.   We actually stayed here three sepaarte times in Oct/Nov 2019 with travel in between. Frankly we booked three different types of rooms and think the suite option aat least the room we got was not worth the extra money versus the Egyptian room   The late had balcony on back 
Very nice location, very nice interior and very nice breakfast buffet, and concierge ""Gossypium"" staff 
narrow roof top pool but decent size lenght for laps if you are so inclined lie me.",5,2019,11,20
13,Barcelona Vacation,"We stayed at the Cotton House for five night. The first stay was four nights and then we stayed there an extra night at the end of the stay. The hotel is great. Very clean and in a great location. The only issue we had was with housekeeping. Had two days in our stay where housekeeping either did not show up or did not show up until really late in the day...actually cleaned the room while we were waiting.

I am a hi level Marriott member because of all of my travels and we thought that we would have been able to check in the hotel early as we had just traveled 20 hours to get there and arrived at 9:00am. Unfortunately we were not able to check in until 2:00pm. Just made it hard after such a long flight.",4,2019,11,19
13,I can’t say enough ,"The best staff of any property I’ve stayed, and I’ve stayed at a lot.
Details, from the attention paid to my room, to the smiles and present conversation at breakfast. 
The restaurant and lounge at dinner can be lively and interactive, depending on the night. 
I will be back over and over.",5,2019,11,15
13,Could be the best hotel ever if,"Prior to our arrival we advised reception that we will need an early check in ( we were traveling with a three years old) .At our surprise the room was not ready but we understood and went for a lunch at the hotel restaurant. The waitress was kind of either tired or hates her job. Zero smile and lousy service...food on the other hand was good. After the lunch around 2 pm we checked on our room if it was ready when they advised us that we received an upgrade but the room will be ready little bit after 3 pm.
We understand the occupancy issues and this is not something we can criticize the hotel about but they might learn something from The Ritz 😊
The upgrade we received was really amazing suite called Vichy Suite with a magnificent terrace and overall a real gem.
The hotel pool and a gym are a joke - perhaps a couple can fit in. The location of the hotel is really great and close to major attractions.
The hotel is worth a visit but we personally would prefer rather Hotel Arts.
Now the best part of the hotel is impeccable and personalized service by Mr Julian from the Front Desk. He is such an enthusiastic and positively energized young man. He left us truly amazed.
The breakfast staff were superb too - Manuel and Pierre!
Bellboy Reyes was also super kind and attentive to details.
These staff made a stay at Cotton House worthy!",4,2019,11,15
13,Worse service ,"I was amazed (not in a good way), kids running the breakfast and lunch - no coordination and many mistakes in what we ordered. Some of my friend’s food never arrived. 

The hotel is very well situated and it’s has some character overall, thus they have to step up in their waiters and bar personal. 

I won’t go back to that hotel just because of that, as well as my 5 other friends.

13,Not a cookie cutter hotel,"The building and rooms have character, which I appreciate. I found the room well appointed and functional, though having the shower as a ""room"" is an unusual design choice. As one would expect from a Marriott property, the beds are comfortable. As an added bonus, the thermostat works. 

I found the staff excellent, friendly and helpful. I would stay here again.

I had only two real complaints. First, the fitness room is tiny. Although I never saw another person there, two would have been a crowd. Second, they charge 3 euro for a Nespresso pod in the room. Marriott does this at a lot of their high-end properties in Europe and it just makes it feel as though they're nickel-and-diming you. On the other hand, it's a standard home Nespresso unit so you could always get your own capsules at a grocery or convenience store.",4,2019,11,10
13,Walls are made of paper,"Average hotel for a premium price in downtown Barcelona. I was very excited about spending a week here during a conference. But in the end it was quite disappointing.

The hotel has a few nice details, great decor, location close to many landmarks. But it was quite a few issues. The gym is ridiculously small, with just two cardio machines. Most importantly it's very noisy! I didn't have a single night of silence. I could hear the room next door until 1am. And they weren't even shouting, just regular talking and TV. Same thing for housekeeping. You can hear every single door opening and closing in the entire floor!",3,2019,11,08
13,FANTASTIC Marriott Property,"I looked at all the Marriott properties in Barcelona before deciding on this one, and after reading all the TA reviews. As a Marriott Titanium Elite I've been at a lot of properties and have to say this is one of the best. The staff is just over the top with excellence even though many are young interns, but maybe that makes them great because they are so eager to help. The room was super clean, great bedding and quite comfortable. My only complaint would be the TV which is very, very limited especially if you're from the US and used to a lot of cable channels. Didn't get a chance to use the pool but it looked interesting, top floor outdoor lap pool. The onsite restaurant and bar was GREAT! Again, super staff. The location for what we wanted to do was EXCELLENT. Everything including the theater was in walking distance. For a few things like the Sagrada Familia church we took a taxi for about 6 euros, but we could have done the 25 min walk. If I ever get back to Barcelona, this will be my base camp for sure!",5,2019,11,08
13,Wonderful experience,"From the cold Cava at the check in to the magnificent sheets and towel, The Cotton House was a superb experience. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable,  the room luxurious and the location perfect for a week in Barcelona. We will be back!",5,2019,11,06
13,"Excellent.  Perfect location, superb staff","The location is hard to beat.  Easily walk everywhere (or at least to a hop-a-bus that will take you to the other sites),
   Each member of the well-trained staff was excellent.   Front desk, bellman, breakfast waitstaff, and the concierge desk.  All very friendly and helpful with a GENUINE interest in serving the guests.",5,2019,11,05
13,Good location ,"This hotel is located in a quieter part of Barcelona within walking distance to everything.  The hotel is pricey.  The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly. Breakfast is not included, but is good.",5,2019,11,05
13,Wonderful - I’ll be back!,"My wife and I stayed in this wonderful Barcelona hotel, which is converted from an old house. This is a great boutique hotel. It’s really interesting, intimate, with a beautiful bar and restaurant. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The property is very well-kept.  

Only stayed one night but were very pleased, well taken care of by the staff, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended!",5,2019,11,05
13,Perfect hotel,"This is one of the best hotel we have stayed in. Fantastic service from the minute we walked in to the minute we left, great room, very comfy bed, large bathroom, roof terrace with fantastic views, excellent food. An oasis away from the hustle and bustle with great central position.",5,2019,10,31
13,A Very Memorable Stay,"  My husband and I spent 5 nights at The Cotton House in October.  From the moment we walked in, we knew we were in for something special.  The decor is stunning.  It is an historic building with an interesting history.  As we arrived early in the morning, our room was not ready.  Our luggage was stored for us until our room was ready.  We were offered a tour of the building and learned its history.  The staff was welcoming and very professional.  They were very friendly and gave us great information and advice.  
   We had a very nice, comfortable room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard.  Complimentary robes, slippers and luxury bath products were provided.  We especially loved the separate room with a rain shower and separate deep, bathtub.  Everything was 5 star!
  We had a wonderful complimentary breakfast every morning.  Hot dishes could be ordered for 5 euros each.  They were excellent and well worth it.  My favorite were the waffles with dulce de leche.  A heavenly treat!  The dining rooms were beautifully decorated and there was also a pleasant outdoor dining area.  We enjoyed a glass of wine there and relaxed among the lush plants and flowers.  
  There is a very small lap pool on the roof and small patio.  A great spot to enjoy a bottle of wine at night.  
  The hotel is located in a nice area of Barcelona, away from the more touristy areas.  It is within easy walking distance to restaurants, shops and attractions.  
   Our trip was to celebrate our recent anniversary and we were pleasantly surprised one night with a bottle of cava and chocolates.  A very thoughtful and enjoyable gift!
  We had a very memorable stay at The Cotton House.  I highly recommend this excellent hotel.",5,2019,10,30
13,Beautiful Hotel in Great Location,"Spent a few days at the Cotton House and had a wonderful time. Wonderful central location made it easy to take a quick cab ride or pleasant walk to the sea, restaurants, bars, shopping, etc. The rooftop pool is very small but very intimate with outstanding views of the city. I'm a very loyal Marriott customer and my Titanium status didn't lend much help if you're looking for an upgrade.",5,2019,10,29
13,Beautiful hotel,"We had a lovely deluxe king room overlooking the courtyard on the 4th floor. The hotel is a lovely blend of the historical features of the building and the modern renovations.
The staff at reception and the concierge staff are very welcoming and gave us some good recommendations.The hotel is very conveniently located close to several of Gaudi's buildings and the Sagrada familia. There are always taxis close by to access all  areas of the city.
There are nice restaurants & bars a short walk away including El Mercat for tapas, El Nacional bars & restaurants and a great cafe called Alsur just around the corner",4,2019,10,25
13,A Grand Hotel,"We have stayed at the Cotton House twice, both times it was before our cruise. They are conveniently located about a block from the Las Ramblas and close to the Hop on Hop Off Bus Stop. The area, although busy, is a very nice area with shops and small restaurants within walking distance.

The rooms are spacious and very clean and comfortable. Our rooms overlooked the restaurant and garden and was very quiet. Food in the restaurant is priced about what you would expect for such a nice hotel. Everything we ate there was fantastic and absolutely no complaints with  either quality, quantity or service. A very nice experience.
We highly recommend the property and have friends that are going to stay based on our recommendation.",5,2019,10,21
13,Room without a view,"3 night stay, reception staff were very welcoming and accommodating. 
Room was okay internally but a ‘view’ over some kind of aircon or pool unit and on the corridor by the lift with a tiled floor (noisy). 
The blackout curtains didn’t meet and so there were streaks of light as a wake up call.
Breakfast - a reasonable buffet, but so slow service on coffee and eggs, on 2 mornings.
Over EUR300/night..?  They need to provide better...
",3,2019,10,19
13,Great Boutique Hotel in Center of City,"If you are looking for an exceptional boutique hotel The Cotton House is perfect. It is a historic property in the middle of Barcelona. The Cotton House started as a private residence. It was a two story home. The Cotton Exchange purchased the residence and added four more floors for administration offices and meeting rooms. The conversion to a hotel added great guest rooms along with open spaces and historic decor. The spiral staircase is a must see. The staff, especially the concierge staff, is very friendly and helpful. 
The breakfast, which was included with our room is sensational. The lunch and dinner menus are limited. However, many local tapas bars are within walking distance.
Overall great experience.",5,2019,10,17
13,Great Stay,"We stayed at the Cotton house 10/7 to 10/13 and loved it.  
Positive points- the place was spotless, spacious rooms including the bath and closet, bed and bedding was super comfortable, staff were great and the location close to all.
Negative points- they held $100 Euro per night security. They actually took this from my account until we checked out, restaurant was ok, but very costly and not worth it, I asked for ice at the bar to take to my room, and was charged $5e for the ice and $5e for the service
The place was great and I’ll stay again next time in Barcelona, just won’t use the restaurant or their ice!",5,2019,10,15
13,A jewel in the city,"This was our first trip to Barcelona and there could not have been a better place to stay.  In addition to the spectacular venue itself, its history made the hotel even more wonderful.
The staff, food and concierge service could not have been better and the location, in the heart of the city, was perfect.
The five star rating is on spot for this European gem.",5,2019,10,15
13,"Lovely Boutique Hotel, Great Location","We stayed 3 nights coming off a Viking ocean cruise.  We had prebooked using Marriott points and added one upgrade.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful, in a perfect location, near shops, within walking distance to many attractions,Iincluding the cathedral of Barcelona, Sagrada Familia, La Palau de Musica,... and has an incredible staff.  The desk staff was amazing,there to greet you upon your return from your outing with a glass of iced spa water of cava.   Arrangements for tickets to parc guell were made with ease as were directions to museums, etc.  The patio is lovely for a late afternoon glass of wine.   This is a jewel in a city that offers so much.  Thank you for making our stay one to remember. ",5,2019,10,12
13,Unique hotel,"The best hotel in Barcelona. Very unique. Service was great as was the room.  I would not recommend their gym, it was very small with limited weights. The hotel has tons of picture worthy areas and is centrally located with restaurants and shops nearby. Has the feel of a boutique luxury hotel. The history of the hotel is a nice fit.",5,2019,10,11
13,Mediocre ,"The hotel has a great concept being an old
Cotton factory. The theme is pretty cool with linens placed in places in the hotel. The rooms are small. There is a refrigerator that goes off in the middle of the night that’s uber loud . The walls are paper thin you can hear people’s conversations. I would pass if you want to pay for a luxury hotel. ",3,2019,10,10
13,Lovely historic hotel with rooftop pool,"This is a very convenient hotel with beautiful details and decor. There is an outdoor patio for dining which is lovely. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The concierge was great, She helped me set up Cabify which takes the place of Uber here.The rooms and bathroom have been updated very well recently. The breakfast is generous with fruit and pastries. Meals on the patio are very good.They have a fabulous white chocolate soup dessert that is to die for! I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Barcelona.",4,2019,10,09
13,Mixed Bag,"The property is lovely and the staff try hard to provide great service. This is 3 instead of 5 for 2 reasons —the restaurant served me raw chicken which was a shock. They seemed to think they did me a favor by not charging me for it! The second reason is that an overly zealous bellman grabbed my luggage as I was checking out and despite my protestations, shoved me in s taxi. Turns out the taxi driver did not understand where I was going and then let me out at a point that turned out to be a half-mile from where I was going. It was an unsafe area through which I had to drag my suitcase!

If you do stay here, explore off property food options as they are probably much better and less likely to make you sick!",3,2019,10,05
13,excellent hotel,"the property is great, well located, comfortable modern rooms, the staff is outstanding. I come from a previous bad experience at a Marriott hotel and this one makes up for that. I will definitely return to this property.",5,2019,10,05
13,Overnight stay,Found the hotel and staff very good would definitely consider staying again and recommend to other people.Room was very clean and spacious although the room was overlooking a busy thoroughfare when window was closed there was any noise.,5,2019,10,03
13,LOVELY property in the city ,"very charming, unique, old plantation type feel... it’s a very special place!  Especially the service was above & beyond- everyone was super helpful- ESPECIALLY Carla (at front desk) & Reyes (bellman from Dominican Republic). 

Attention was paid to every little detail. The shower & bathtub were in their own separate room. Great bath amenities & super yummy towels!  USB plugs in the wall. Great robes & hair dryer.  Rooftop pool was divine with views of Sagrada Familia cathedral & Monserrat in the distance.  The library & restaurant / bar with seating indoor & outdoor served a delicious buffet breakfast.  The decor all over was divine. Location is in the heart of the city, but in an upscale neighborhood with great shopping.  This was in contrast to the hotel I had just left on Las Ramblas that was like a tourist trap. 

FYI, my first room was an interior room that made me feel claustrophobic- but they quickly changed me to a fabulous one! I booked through Am Ex FHR program, which gave me an upgrade, early check in, late check out, breakfast for 2 & $100 FB credit. GREAT deal!",5,2019,10,03
13,Great stay at the Cotton House!,"We loved this hotel and can't say enough about the staff there. From the reception desk to the bellman and from the concierge to the dining room/bar, everyone was very helpful and pleasant. Such nice people!

Our room was on the 6th floor with a balcony overlooking a courtyard that also enclosed the outdoor patio dining area. The breakfast served in the dining/bar area was amazing. We ate jamon iberico every day and it was the best thing ever!

There was a great rooftop pool with a small bar. Yes, there are umbrellas and they serve drinks and food items.

We were within walking distance of La Sagrada Familia as well as many restaurants. We also easily walked to Placa Catalunya to catch a bus to Montserrat. The walk to the Mandarin for the Moments Restaurant tasting menu was also quick. I was a little apprehensive at first to walk at night but there were no problems at all.

We loved the feel of this hotel, kinda' old worldly with lots of history but also modern amenities. Would stay here again.",5,2019,10,01
13,Close to perfect,"Historic building lovingly restored. Great introduction by concierge to history on arrival. 
Breakfast excellent and they will make anything for you.
We stayed in 2 story apartment with great private patio.
Very small gym.
Good location.

Only complaint was the check in process. Young lady was on the phone while lecturing us about 3 pm being the time our room had too be ready. We had requested early check in and realized that it is never guaranteed. We arrived at 1 and was told would take an hour to clean room. Called at exactly 3::01 to be told room was,ready.",4,2019,09,29
13,Amazing beautiful decorations.,This hotel has a very special feeling from the terrace and restaurant and bar amazing decor and super stairway in the lobby.  Great views from the roof top pool as well.  Great friendly service.  No gym  No spa.,5,2019,09,29
13,Most amazing hotel,"From the moment we stepped into the hotel till the time we left, we had nothing but amazing service.
We stay in many luxury hotels around the world and I have to say this was one of my favorites. The front office staff were so nice, friendly and helpful. They found out it was our anniversary ( my wife of course had to mention it) well out came the bubbly, and later we received a room amenity that was amazing.The bedding is so comfortable and the location is great. I'm sorry I don't remember the girls names at the front desk but honestly they were all great.Congratulations on a hotel run so well.",5,2019,09,23
13,Wondering if they stayed at the same hotel,"Every now and then I come across a hotel or restaurant where the reviews heap high praise on the establishment encouraging me to stay or dine there, only to wonder, once I do, if the previous reviewers and I went to the same place.

There is no false advertising or trick photography in the room pictures. The rooms look exactly as represented. What's missing is how truly small and cramped the rooms are, so cramped that the bathroom sink is literally in the eight by four foot corridor between the room door and the room itself. When you step out of the shower you're stepping directly into that same entry corridor. If you're traveling solo, the arrangement is no disadvantage. If you're traveling with a companion, plan on showering and dressing in shifts.

Our room came with a shabby balcony overlooking adjacent rooftops, rooftop air conditioning units, and residential laundry hung out to dry on wooden porches behind neighboring residential apartments.

To the reviewer who found the public spaces ""stunning"" and ""absolutely beautiful"" I'd have to advise him to get out more. The public spaces are cramped and 'quaint', ""quaint"" here a polite euphemism for old, tired, and in need of repair. Looking around while sitting outside on the deck at breakfast, you might think to add 'dirty' to the description.  

The praise that I found most incomprehensible, though, was the seeming uniform praise of the staff and the service. My wife and I spent three days here two weeks ago. The service staff is seemingly comprised of an abundance of uniformly attractive young people in their twenties with no concept, whatsoever, of what passes for merely average hotel service, let alone the kind of service one might expect from an Autograph Collection hotel. 

I could cite at least a half a dozen consistently bad and unprofessional interactions with hotel staff from reception to the restaurant to the bar, and I would if someone asked me to, but I'm confident that anyone reading this review can anticipate what I might have to say. The operative words here are 'consistently bad' and that's coming from someone not particularly demanding or hard to please.

The breakfast buffet was terrible. The last breakfast buffet I saw at a Marriott Courtyard Inn would have been preferable. So terrible that although we had paid for breakfast, after our first breakfast experience, my wife and I ate breakfast at a coffee house around the corner.

As a parting 'gift', when the valet brought my car around upon checkout, although my new car had been bright and shiny when we checked in, and we didn't use the car even once while staying in Barcelona, the car was returned to me with an eighth of an inch of construction dust on it. 

And then there was that inexplicable $200 charge on my credit card that posted days after we checked out. 

The hotel's location was OK, but know that you're predominantly going to want to sight-see and dine well east of the hotel. While we were able to walk to virtually every other restaurant we dined at during an almost three week vacation in Spain, we found that we had to cab to and from dinner all three nights in Barcelona. 

I hate to write a uniformly negative review so let me praise the Cotton House's air conditioning system. Possibly the best in Spain.

And if I might offer some parting advice, if you're thinking about staying at the Cotton House and not for any reason having to do with Marriott, you should consider the El Palace Hotel right next door. By all outward appearances a much better choice.",3,2019,09,19
13,"Beautiful Design, Excellent Concierge","Place is stunning.  Absolutely beautiful - from the lobby to the bar to the breakfast room to the terrace the patio the rooms the suites the hotel is exquisitely decorated and designed.  On to the Concierge desk - WOW.  Talk about insider tips!  Javier, Cristina, and Sara were helpful pre-arrival, and amazing once we were on property.  Javier took care of our every need - restaurants, tours, reservations, etc.  Sara helped us celebrate our anniversary and sent us some treats and even decorated our room how sweet.  Cristina was the wonderful.  SO helpful, she really made our stay.  We stopped by el nacional for late night dinner because it was the same designers at Cotton House.  ( please tell her we went! )  That's the kind of inside information and local touch a good concierge can provide.  Please extend our gratitude for their wonderful service.  - kevin from new york",5,2019,09,12
13,Courteous & Helpful staffs--Beautiful and artistically decorated Hotel.  One of the kind!,"I first came across this hotel on Instagram, and fell in love with it.  That motivated me to travel to Barcelona and to other regions of Spain.  The Hotel location is perfect, walking distances to Sargarda Familia as well as Passeig de Gracia (fancy shopping streets such as Chanel...etc) to the La Rambla and then down to the seaport.
I booked a spa treatment the day of checked in, the spa room is located on the 6th floor and the treatment was amazing.  The outdoor rooftop swimming pool (also on the 6th floor) is small but so tastefully decoratedand cozy.  They even have an out door bar with service staff so the guest is able to order a cocktail while sitting by the poolside.  The view from the roof top is also breath taking.  We enjoyed several meals from the Batuar resturant--indoor or in the courtyard.  Lovely environments.  Would love to visit again.",5,2019,09,11
13,Best Location in Barcelona!,"Me and my husband stayed at Cotton House in July and it was just perfect, special thanks to Andreu! 
We had a car as we travelled in Spain after that. Alex was super attentive and always took our car for the parking and brought it back when we needed.
We were welcomed by Laura at the reception that was always helpful with us.
The room is super cozy, there was a balcony where we could seat and relax a bit during our stay.
The location is amazing, we could go walking for the main attractions, stores, bars and restaurants! 
They also have a nice terrace for drinks in the afternoon!
Would definitely come back and recommend this hotel!",5,2019,09,10
13,Holiday,"Excellent ambience, very good service, great room and bed, convenient location. Place reflects historical trading links 
Staff speak fluent English, good location. Great view from roof patio
Worth the price   A Marriott/Bonvoy Hotel",5,2019,09,09
13,Outstanding Service,"Room rather small, and rooftop patio underutilized since limited drink service, plus they lock door at 10PM. But, wow, what outstanding service from front desk through concierge. Really attentive. More so than any hotel I can remember visiting elsewhere. Loved the location too.",4,2019,09,06
13,First Class,"What an amazing hotel!   Wonderful service!   Superb Hotel Restaurant & Bar!    Coordinated an amazing Gaudi Tour!   Wonderfully appointed rooms, beds, linens with all the comforts of home. BEAUTIFUL environment, furnishing and artwork through out the hotel.",5,2019,09,04
13,A fun yet calm oasis in the heart of Barcelona,"We spent 5 amazing days at the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona, which is a Marriott/Bonvoy property, and were extremely pleased with everything related to our stay there.  From the minute we arrived we were wonderfully taken care of by Alba and the front desk staff.  Concierge Javier looked after all of our touring needs, expertly guiding us each day with advice on where to go and assisting us with attraction ticket purchases. The location of the hotel was ideally suited to exploring Barcelona - in a quiet area but centrally located near the Gothic Quarter and close enough to walk most places.  Our room had a lovely balcony overlooking the inner courtyard and hotel terrace, and featured the most comfortable beds and luxurious bedding of our entire trip. The rooftop pool (with a panoramic view of Barcelona) was also much appreciated and was a great place to cool down and unwind after the heat and hectic pace of Barcelona.  We had a wonderful breakfast every morning in their restaurant, and were offered a reduced price because of the length of our stay.  We would definitely stay here again should our travels return us to Barcelona.",5,2019,08,25
13,Exceptional boutique hotel with amazing staff and amenities,"We recently stayed at the Cotton House Hotel for 5 nights and we were blown away with the property, staff and all of the nice amenities. We stayed in a Junior Suite and had more than enough space for a family of 3.  Our suite came with a gorgeous patio with beautiful ivy walls.  It was a great space for us to sit in the mornings to read and at night to just talk while our 7 year old daughter would be asleep.  

The history of the hotel is so intriguing definitely ask for a short tour at the front desk which will give you a better appreciation of the hotel.  

The rooftop dipping pool was spectacular.  It has a small bar and an amazing view of Barcelona including the Sangrada Familia.  

Our room came with a complimentary breakfast buffet which was delicious and quite a large spread.  Our family enjoyed that time every morning. 

The customer service in this hotel was top notch.  Everyone was so welcoming and helpful. The concierge team gave great suggestions for dining and shopping spots.  They also called the airport when we had questions about the tax refund process and clarified our specific questions.  

We had the most amazing stay and would highly recommend this hotel to those travelers even with kids as it was one of the most comfortable stays for our family.  The Cotton House is impeccable and we will definitely stay again if we visit Barcelona again.",5,2019,08,25
13,Poor staff service and housekeeping,"It’s not a five star hotel standard. The hotel staff at breakfast restaurant is inattentive - waited for long to get someone to order hot dishes and refill the food at the buffet tables.  Food is so so - the pancake was already cold when serving, guess no one served it out from the kitchen.  The house keeping is the worst - They don’t refill bath amenities, towels have stained, hair on the floor.  Basically they just changed towels and tidy the bed without cleaning and tidying up.  With this price, I will choose other hotels with better location.  The room is a bit dated (especially the bathroom) and need a renovation for the price they charged.",2,2019,08,15
13,Barcelona visit,Wonderful service. Great atmosphere. Excellent food. Convenient downtown location. Hope to be able to stay there again. The entire staff from bellman to front desk and restaurant service staff professional and very kind,5,2019,08,13
13,Beautiful and classy hotel ,"We traveled as a family of 4 with a 4 month old baby and a 5 y.o.  The hotel is really pretty and has a small rooftop pool to enjoy after a hot day in the city.  The garden is amazing, very pretty and serves a nice breakfast.  It is in a perfect location to discover the city center by foot.

The front desk was very friendly and helpful, they welcomed our daughter with a little present and offered us some water on arrival.

Unfortunately our experience with the restaurant staff (specially at breakfast)wasn’t that good.... at breakfast the ladies specially one of them who did not speak Spanish, I believe she spoke fresh was very rude... never smiled, she kept on talking with her colleagues while everyone was waiting to be asked for orders of warm food.  She seemed to be the coordinator and her unfriendliness was also observed with her female colleagues.   On the other hand, the men working in the restaurant were very friendly and helpful...but were constantly told off by their female colleagues which I found really uncomfortable and unnecessary.

Dinner was nice, portions were rather small and we experienced the same issue described for breakfast: the ladies very unfriendly und somehow annoyed to be working there and the men very friendly and smiley but put aside by their female colleagues.

All in all nice boutique hotel, still lacking from professional people in their restaurant. Otherwise ok for business or leisure trips.

13,A special place,"fantastic hotel, fantastic room, fantastic staff.  we stayed in the hotel for 6 nights.  always available staff, especially Gigi, serena and Carla.  the pool has a great view and the rooms are a dream.  great location, well served.",5,2019,08,10
13,"This is 4+, not 5 at all","Beautiful hotel. 
Pleasant location.
Gorgeous design.
Terrific concept and idea.

Poor execution.
Lack of luxury experience.
Nice try.

My suggestion: come to this hotel to have a drink, or for excursion and super pictures. But don't stay here. Choose something else. 

I write this review from a COTTON HOUSE room. I can't sleep here at all. I wake up at six every day. 

The room is small. The only Window has a size of a briefcase. A flat TV is bigger than this window. I can touch the next room""s curtains if I pull my hand outside the window.

It's stuffy here. Lack of space. A/c Works perfect but it burns out oxygen in an hour if you have adult's lungs. You open your squizzed window to a tiny yard. And you feel better but only if you are earless. Because industrial noise of conditioning systems and infravibrations of ventilation creates a full sound picture of a modern airport like Frankfurt. Add some bass drums exercises from a room refrigerator which joyfully jumps every time when it awakens or falls asleep. And, of course, you can hear when your neighbour to the North West farts and what exactly the old pair from the corridor thinks about the last flamenco show. 

Pool. Khmmm. I wouldn't call it so. It has a size of a pool table, it's true. When I saw it, I thought I messed with the floors and got into a someone's semiprivate bathroom. The size of the pool can be compensated by a great city view. It's a nice venue at the Golden hour to take panoramic views 📷 with a glass of cava.

Breakfasts are ok. Take buffet, don't take a-la carte. They will bring cold meals. Coffee and teas are superb. I am not kidding. It's a drama to find a good espresso or ""te caliente"" in Spain. 

But what's good here?
Design. History. Colonial concept. 
Beds, pillows and linen are amazing. 
Friendly personnel.

My wife thinks this is an amazing place to hold hi class events for luxury brands. But not for living here. I can agree with her. Not for a price of 5*.

13,Wonderful Hotel,"Fantastic hotel in a great location!  Lovely room facing the street yet very quiet. Bed is very comfortable and bath products are great. The staff here cannot do enough for you.

We can’t wait to come back!",5,2019,08,07
13,Service needs dramatic improvement,"Wonderful hotel well located in Barcelona. The design is simply wonderful, rooms are great but need some refurbishment. My room was facing the street but still very quiet which is important to me. The quality of the food is average. Do not take the avocado toast, it is just some pieces of avocado thrown on a toast with some cheese, see picture. Really!!!!! The personal is young and without any experience so you can feel the constant chaos and you have to constantly remind them about things you have ordered. Interesting enough, i have never seen so many people complaining during breakfast. I do not even know if there is a manager, i have not seen him. They have a great patio on the back where it is worth having a drink. This may be the worst managed Autograph collection hotel and i have stayed in few. There are better alternatives in Barcelona.",3,2019,08,06
13,Chic hotel,"The hotel was ultra chic and I loved our small room(which was an upgrade by the way). The staff couldn’t get anything right though. Our room blew a fuse and all of our electricity went out. We were rushing to get ready and make our appointment at the La Familia. They said they would send someone up. No one ever showed. Fortunately my husband was able to find the fuse box and fix it ourselves. That is one example. They said sorry we sent someone to the wrong room. Ummmmm over an hour ago!? Anyways, the list continues. Though I will say the hotel was pretty enough I would return just knowing essentially I was on my own with the customer service",4,2019,08,06
13,Customer Service at it's Finest!!!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Cotton House. I can not say enough about the staff here. I have several allergies and they were very accommodating. The concierge and manager went above and beyond in getting me specific water as I have a  sulfur allergy.   The rooms were lovely. I would just say that the restaurant could be a little better. Overall, I would go back over and over because the staff truly understand customer service and make you feel at home. Gracias.",5,2019,08,06
13,Great Hotel in a great location,"My father, mother, and brother recently stayed at the Cotton House in Barcelona while on a family trip to Spain. The hotel was centrally located and near all of the major items to see in the city or easily accessible by the metro.
The rooms were large, very comfortable and surprisingly quite for being so centrally located. However the main thing that separated our stay at this hotel from any other hotel was how friendly, helpful, and attentive the staff was. Whether it was saying hello each morning, helping us to easily plan things to do or make dinner reservations, or how genuinely friendly all of the hotel staff was to my family, their attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond made our stay amazing.",5,2019,07,31
13,Happy we stayed here,"This was our first time trip to Barcelona, and overall satisfied I had chose the Cotton House hotel for 3 nights there; Not only we felt good when woke up each morning, ready to start our strolls within the city for the day, we also think we stayed while in a good care of each hotel workers/staff. 
There were things that didn't work out smoothly (e.i sensitive room key card and getting help or advise on finding an English speaking doctor/clinic nearby for quick visits), but even those didn't make me to change my opinion on how very good the hotel is. Meravellós!",4,2019,07,30
13,First time on Barcelona,Soooo loved this hotel. Rainy one night so we ate in the restaurant. It was delicious.The bartender can make mean martinis and manhattans. Extremely accommodating staff on their cute dresses were sonice. We stayed five nights and we didn't want to leave.,5,2019,07,24
13,"Stay somewhere else, not worth money","Usually my stays with Marriott Bonvoy are amazing, but this hotel was absolutely horrible. The restaurant was barf and SLOW, they key cards needed to be replaced everyday, the door in the bathroom wouldn't open because the screws in door jam and strike plate were falling out. We were originally told at 2pm room wasn't ready which was fine until 330pm when we were again told housekeeping made an error and they didn't know when we would get a room. That didn't go over well due to us having a tour at 5pm and we needed somewhere to get ready. They did let us get ready in  temporary room, but still a bit unnerving not knowing if we were ever going to get a room. The people who work here seem nice but collectively have no idea how to handle customer service, they are very young with nobody to help them when problems arise. Every day on the 1st floor outside restaurant the staff was just standing/sitting around with not a clue what to do with themselves. An example is when we went to restaurant 1st day to wait for room we sat and waited 20 minutes to order anything. We watched the staff setting a table next to us, helping customers that arrived after us and yes we asked to order several times. It took an hour after that to get our meal. We finally just had to leave because we had a tour. This hotel stay has made me cancel my reservations with Mariott in Paris due to similar concerns and complaints. Come on Marriott you can do so much better!!",2,2019,07,24
13,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights using points, the hotel is stunning! We were greeted with fizz on arrival and showed to our room - I scored 4 as room was disappointing as was dark with no view at all but as we used points I was sort of ok with this. The rooftop pool is fantastic and so lovely to dip feet into after a long day walking Barcelona.... we loved it here!!",4,2019,07,22
13,Stay elsewhere,"Good location.  Friendly staff. Small but clean rooms (it's Europe). Food-go anywhere else.  Room service,  a joke. Nice for evening drinks on the back terrace.  Stayed 8 days and they were not able to consistently fulfill any request; ie key cards not working...ok it will be fixed.. day after day, nothing...aggravating.  extra towels...had to request every day.  If I'm back in Barcelona,  I'll stay somewhere else.",2,2019,07,17
13,Terrible Customer Service,"This was our first trip to Barcelona... So far the people have been extremely kind and friendly. Checking into the cotton house we felt the same. A nice room, convenient location and clean. I am travelling with two kids that include a 5month baby. Upon trying to heat water up for her milk we realized the kettle was generating a rust like residue. Complained to Laura at the reception several times and she kept sending up kettles but no one understood English and there was no help from the reception despite the many complains. 

To top it off the refused to clean our bathroom and room unless we left the room despite us having a 5month baby and me telling them that we have lost our personal belongings in the past. This was the first hotel that has refused housekeeping and this is over a stay of 4 nights in a Triple room! 

I would strongly discourage this hotel for families especially with children as the staff here has no empathy or any sense of hospitality. As a Marriot Bonvoy Member I am extremely disheartened by the service standards at this hotel.",1,2019,07,14
13,Wonderful boutique hotel ,"This is a wonderful spot and n the heart of Barcelona. Easy walking to so many spots, the rooms are extremely sound proof, though small. Elegant and well appointed, the hotel has excellent food and drink. A well equipped though again very small fitness room is available, and a lovely rooftop pool. The best feature of the hotel is their army of young, friendly and knowledgeable concierge staff. We will be back. ",5,2019,07,11
13,Gorgeous Property & Excellent Staff,"The Cotton House is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful city. The staff (especially Marcie) where outstanding and very helpful. The location is about a 10-15 minute walk to the heart of the gothic quarter or the Arc and Citadel Park. Not an issue for us but there are many hotels closer to those areas. However, we were very happy with our stay here after finishing a cruise in Barcelona. There is a rooftop pool with a great view of the city and the Sagrada Familia. The rooms are very well air conditioned and the decor was beautiful. This is a great option for a more luxurious stay.",5,2019,07,10
13,Excellent staff and well appointed room,"The staff at Cotton House are extremely attentive and helpful. From running down the street to hail a taxi to staying up late past 02:00 to receive us after a late flight, they never missed an opportunity to be of assistance (and Reyes at the door is a delight). 

The room was beautiful and was stocked with everything one would need and a few things you wouldn’t realize you wanted till you had the option. 

The acoustics of the building left a bit to be desired. Knocking sounds from the rooms above and doors opening and closing in the hallway were very evident. In all fairness, I am a light sleeper but normally 5 star hotel rooms are fairly silent. Additionally, the black out curtains don’t stop light from coming in on both sides and so don’t actually function as real black outs. If these gripes don’t resonate with you, you’ll likely find this hotel to be fairly perfect. ",4,2019,07,07
13,Fantastic hotel,"You will love the accommodations 
We stayed there with our friends
Booked two rooms
Great 
Location and wonderful history
If we return to Barcelona in the future we would certainly consider staying there",5,2019,07,02
13,Princely price for a “Jail Room”,"The room they assigned us was supposed to have a city view, instead we were provided with a room that was tiny and literally had a small window facing three white walls five meters from the window. It felt like you were paying over $450 per night to stay in a dark prison cell. Furthermore, the front desk manager was very rude and made no effort to seek an alternative, she insisted we had to stay since it was past the 48 hour cancellation policy. My wife and I were traveling for a family holiday and have never gone through such a terrible experience at supposedly a five star service oriented hotel. As a benchmark we are frequent travelers who have been fortunate to spend many nights at five star hotels in Italy, UK, Greece, US and France - this hotel was the worst; I would NOT recommend staying here !",1,2019,06,25
13,great staff,"Great staff. They are hard working and diligent people. They didn't miss any of my requests. Small room. The room was too small for two people. I couldn't open my suitcase while my wife opens hers. However, you can forget about the size problem once you are helped by the staff members.",5,2019,06,20
13,A wonderful boutique hotel,"Our family recently stayed at the Cotton House. The staff are wonderful. Javier and Blanca at the Concierge desk are amazing. Javier recommended and made reservations at several fantastic restaurants; Blanca helped with bookings for several very interesting events. The accommodations, especially the beds, are very comfortable. The bathrooms are stocked with really nice towels and robes. The room décor is very pleasing. Its small size (less than 90 rooms), allows you to easily interact with the staff and in turn allows them to remember you. The location is great with easy access to many places of interest. Cotton House provides you with the hospitality that Barcelona is well known for.",5,2019,06,16
13,Wonderful botique hotel with first class rooms and top tier service,"This hotel is a perfect choice. Service--whether the front desk, hotel staff, and the bellman named Reyes--were all very nice, professional, and accommodating. The hotel itself was unique and gave the vibe of a first class boutique hotel. The hotel is also an easy walk to most of the touristy spots in Barcelona, including the huge market on La Rambla where one can spend hours trying fresh foods. When I go back to Barcelona, this will likely be my first choice every time.",5,2019,06,15
13,The wait can be long....,"Siestas during the day and a no queue strategy had us bum rushing the counter every 15 minutes for 5 hours before our room was ready (despite platinum status). Rooms are awarded, not based on first come first served or priority status, but on how often you ask for a room. People come in hours later and get rooms. Not that the hotel isn't lovely, it is....but many customers sleep until 3pm so suggest another hotel if you require a 3pm check-in.",3,2019,06,15
13,Beautifully Calm Experience,"We arrived on a cruise ship and were only here one night, The location is beautiful and very convienentt to many sights. Great service at the front desk. Our room wasn't ready but t our bags were held and delivered to our room later while we were out. The hotel did call when the room was ready but we were out enjoying the city. Quiet and cozy was the atmosphere when we were there. We had drinks and snacks in the Restaurant/Bar area outside and it was very nice. Service wasn't the best. Not sure if it was inbetween shifts (?) It didn't matter that day (May 1, a holiday) as we left the next day. I would return for the location if nothing else.",4,2019,06,14
13," Great stay at Cotton House ","Cotton House Barcelona is an intimate hotel set on a beautiful tree lined street, within minutes of La Rambla, Casa Batllo, La Sagrada Família, restaurants and bars.

The arrival was spectacular and much of it was due to the team at the hotel recognizing that we were coming in from an overnight flight from the US. We were greeted with champagne and with an upgrade king room with a balcony. After 45 minutes, our room was ready. Excellent! 

The guest room is large, the bed is super comfortable (ask for a foam pillow and you will be sleeping on cloud nine!), the amenities are great and having that extra space outside to enjoy coffee was awesome. 

What brought me to Barcelona was a meeting and it happened to be my birthday as well. Came back to find birthday cake, cava, and balloons in the room. Such a treat! 

Special thanks to Alba, Clara, Heather, Christina and Matt for making the stay very memorable! 

Now for the “meh” of the stay. Love coffee. However you only get 2 Nespresso capsules per day to enjoy. Each additional one you request is 3 Euro. Seems a bit odd to me to be honest. Not because of what it costs to stay there but because coffee is such a common amenity. Why charge for it? The other part was the breakfast...this needs work. The flavors were not what I was expecting and one morning the omelet had a long hair in it and the server - when I pointed out the hair - said do you want me to take it away? Well, yes, I do. Lol. And I don’t know, maybe say sorry or would you like another one? For 31 Euro a pop, I was disappointed. 

All in all great and would definitely stay here again.

13,9237837 stars for Cotton House,"I wish I could rate this hotel higher than 5 stars. It was perfect. The staff was really helpful and kind, spoke perfect English, and the hotel itself is beautiful. We basically lived on the outdoor terrace and the restaurant serves one of the best cappuccinos I had in Barcelona.",5,2019,06,06
13,Not for us,"Didn’t quite hit the mark. Without repeating all the other Marriott status members’ experiences (which was our experience too) we were assigned a very small, European sized room— the Madras— which was situated directly across from the elevator, behind thin doors, and overlooked the busy street below. However: we made it work for the 1.5 days/two nights we stayed—it just took some constant rearranging of our two weeks’ worth of luggage and ear plugging to make it work. 

While the room’s decor is very lovely, the bed comfortable, the linens soft, the A/C runs at full blast, there were some problems: the shower closet had black mold/water damage and a very confusing door that opened inward. When the shower is turned on, it made the rainfall shower head drip all the door/room, making a huge mess in an already small space. The hairdryer was lacking a motor/ hair guard cap on the back, which I really wished I noticed before loosing a chunk of hair to the hairdryer, painfully. 

Housekeeping never came for the five hours we were out sightseeing, but when we returned around 3p to freshen up for drinks they knocked. We asked if they could give us an hour and we would be out of their way for another two hours. We returned after going back out for drinks/shopping and housekeeping still hadn’t come. Finally I had to walk to the front desk and request the cleaning service during dinner, which was completed then. 

The interior of the hotel is very lovely and we enjoyed having drinks on the relatively empty back patio. The location is perfect for anything you want to do in Barcelona. My advice would be to avoid letting them put you in the Madras room if you need more space, or staying there during a busy time (apparently a Tuesday/Wednesday ahead of summer break falls in that category...) We will be back to Barcelona, but likely not back to the Cotton House in favor of trying another Marriott/SPG/Bonvoy property in the city. ",3,2019,05,30
13,Exceptional Boutique Hotel-First Class,"Perfection! More and better than we expected, the service is welcoming and gracious and they made our stay delightful! We were offered an upgrade on our first and second stay before and after our cruise out of Barcelona. The location is great with so much within walking distance. We were offered a glass of champagne upon arrival and it just gets better from there! Clean and amazing towels and linens of high quality cotton, complimentary bottled waters were provided, snack of chocolates and a small bottle of red Spanish wine were delivered to the room. I can't tell you how amazing the stay was...perfect!",5,2019,05,30
13,So beautiful and nostalgic ,"Amazing cocktails, friendly service and the interior is beautiful ! I felt like in the 50s in Cuba and every corner feels different but special! They’ve paid so much attention to details and that’s why this place gets 5 stars ",5,2019,05,30
13,Amazing Staff ,Just completed a 4 night stay at the Cotton House Hotel. I have had the privilege to stay in several fine hotels over the past 20 years but the Staff at the Cotton House stands out. They go above and beyond to make sure that you are comfortable and satisfied with your accommodations. Their genuine warmth and welcoming smiles are felt each time you pass through the lobby. I was treated like a VIP and I was just an average middle aged lady traveling with family and friends. Stay here. You will love it. Thank you to the Staff @ Cotton House for making our Barcelona stay so wonderful. ,5,2019,05,25
13,Gorgeous and so friendly,"Superb boutique hotel. Interious are stunning and uplifting and link back to ther building's history beautifully. The rooms are beautiful and fresh in design with great amenities. 

The cocktail bar and restaurant are superb. Loved the drinks. Breakfast was very nice. 

All the staff were super friendly and had wonderful attitudes. Highly recommend this place. ",5,2019,05,21
13,Amazing Time in Barcelona,"I decided last minute to find a BonVoy hotel in Barcelona for a few nights. I booked a room at the Cotton House. I can not say enough about how amazing the hotel and staff. Fabulous location, beautiful building, great food and, most of all, an incredible staff. In particular, I want to call out some who work at Batuar (the restaurant) - Laura Cervera, Raphaelle, Alice, Camilla and Quirze. Thank you for giving me such a beautiful stay.",5,2019,05,20
13,Wonderful Stay,"We were upgraded to an Egyptian suite and truly loved our two night stay. The hotel front desk staff were absolutely the most helpful and courteous one could hope for. The hotel, although on a busy, beautiful street, was very quiet inside.. The location is absolutely prime for touring Barcelona. There is a small convenient store two doors down and many great restaurants, hop off bus stops and high end stores nearby.  The breakfast rooms/restaurant and outdoor dining courtyard was stunning. The breakfast buffet was sufficient and coffee was great. I would highly recommend this beautiful boutique hotel.",5,2019,05,17
13,Great choice in Barcelona,"Had a combined pleasure and business trip in Barcelona and booked the Cotton House.  Great location and such a wonderful staff!  The concierge staff (Gossypium- which seems to be a share staff with another property was FABULOUS.  For weeks before I had them sharing ideas and booking tour and restaurant reservations.  While there I had some last minute changes.  All handles exceptionally well!  Room was very comfortable.  Bed was exceptional.  Only criticism was modest closer space. 
Hotel a very unique property and casually elegant vibe.  Centrally located with easy walk to Placa Cataluña, la Rambla and gothic quarter as well as Gaudi houses and Basilica.  I like the hotel arts (a Marriott guy) but like this location better, especially if not in the dead of summer!",5,2019,05,09
13,Cotton House Experience,"Spent 4 days in Barcelona, Cotton House was a fantastic choice. The hotel is centrally located and the staff was exceptionally helpful and courteous. We used the jump on, jump off bus to get an overview of the city before returning to areas we were interested in. ",5,2019,05,03
13,Truly a 5 star experience.,"My wife and I visited April 20-23, 2019 during our honeymoon.  We stayed at many very fine locations throughout our three week trip but Cotton House topped the list for service.  Beautiful facility, and the best service I have ever received at a hotel.  I am a Marriott Ambassador level customer and they went out of their way to respond to our every need.  Their concierge service is outstanding to the point that when we entered they would stand in unison.  A bit funny but very well trained staff.",5,2019,05,03
13,Chic hotel with gracious service in a great location,"We had an amazing stay at this beautiful boutique hotel in a great location between the Eixample and the Gothic Quarter.  No problem getting a lifetime-Gold upgrade with a spacious, attractive room on an upper floor to celebrate our anniversary! The multi-lingual staff is very friendly, especially the young women in the stylish uniforms in the restaurant and Reyes at the front door, who all took such good care of us.  The restaurant is a lovely space with a wonderful breakfast display - lots of choices and excellent coffee -  in the morning that converts to chic bar with great wines and cocktails available in the evening.  We fell in love with the décor - and the linens and towels (seriously, I would have bought those bath sheets if they were available!) - but would one expect any less from a hotel named Cotton House?  We have found our Barcelona hotel!  Can't wait to bring friends here when we visit again in 2020.",5,2019,05,02
13,Beautiful small hotel,"The hotel itself is an antique, rooms are small, but decent. I find it quite over-rated, probably I book this during the Easter period. The service is excellent during check in, concierge, and other restaurants staffs as well. Food in the restaurant is reasonably well for dinning, but there are a lot of better restaurants in Barcelona. However, this hotel is about 15 mins walk from the La Rambla area. 
Breakfast buffet is continental, but you got an option of getting freshly cooked eggs at a premium, which I won't recommend, this is one of the worst egg I ever had.
There are a few outlet stores nearby selling local brands clothing, price are good.",5,2019,05,01
13,Good location for Gothic and Born areas,"This is a historic boutique hotel where the staff is very friendly and helpful, particularly Kiki and Ellen. 
There is a small restaurant and bar as well as a very nice garden area where you can enjoy a meal or cocktail. 
My criticism is with housekeeping. On two of our four days we had to call for coffee pods since none had been replenished. The first time it took over three hours and four requests before the problem was rectified thanks to Ellen. 
This being our first visit to Barcelona we were uncertain if the hotel’s location would be conducive for tourism. We found it to be perfectly situated to key sites. Most sites were within a 10-20 minute walk. ",4,2019,04,28
13,Nice location but too many misses,Compared to other properties I have stayed at like Rosewood and Waldorf Astoria in multiple cites this hotel failed to meet the mark.  Room was clean but had a small bathroom and large closet.  Service at bar and restaurant is slow. Breakfast had very limited selection. Room service is not available 24 hours.  Bar server forgot an item we ordered.  Wine came with a chipped glass.  They did comp some items but service was not as good as the Mandarin and Mercer where we went for lunch. Many people may be satisfied with this hotel but true luxury travelers most likely will be disappointed.,3,2019,04,28
13,Wow!! What a fantastic place,"This hotel was truly amazing. The hotel is beautifully designed/appointed and is swarming with staff; there are a million people everywhere to help with whatever you need. Everyone was great/friendly/amazing - front desk, every concierge and the bellhops. And, their uniforms are stunning. I loved them. 

I will definitely stay here again when I'm in town next time. 

One note: We had two rooms and got an amazing Platinum upgrade. But, the basic level Panama rooms tend to be very small. So, if room size is important, make sure to book a larger room. Also, of you decide to book a Panama room, be sure to book one with a ""larger"" queen bed, as there are two different size Queens beds (with the smaller one being roughly the size of a full). ",5,2019,04,26
13,Lovely boutique hotel with great service,"Stayed here for a mostly work trip. Room was a decent size, great balcony, and excellent staff.  Restaurant was very pretty, and good food.  It is well located, just a few blocks from a major shopping street, and near restaurants and stores. It is a boutique hotel, so some quirkier details (bathroom is bifurcated with hallway entrance to room), but a clean, well cared for hotel.",5,2019,04,24
13,"Check in was chaotic, but clear sailing after that","Cotton House would easily rate five stars if our check in would have been routine to a small hassle.  We arrived after an overnight flight checked our bags and asked about availability.  They suggested that we check back at 1:00pm.  When no room was available then we asked that they call which they advised that they would.  By no call at 3:00 pm we messaged through the app with no response.  We checked again later with Blanca at the Gossypium desk if she could help, and she had us in in five minutes.  So, the lesson here is check your bags, don't count on a call, and come back in the late afternoon.  The rest of the stay was great.  Location is excellent for just about everything.  Barcelona is a very walkable city, and this is central to a lot of great attractions.  Marriott elite level status provided the breakfast at no charge, and it would have been a value at 28 EUR pp.  Rooms are small by US standards, but immaculately clean and well appointed.  Gossypium desk staff were great and helped is out with a lot of great information and directions.  The decor is interesting and beautiful.  It is a wonderful property.",4,2019,04,23
13,Personal service and much more,"My granddaughter and I ‘lived’ for three very enjoyable days in Barcelona at the Cotton House Hotel.  We visited every place we wanted, thanks to the help from the concierge service at this wonderful hotel.
The breakfasts were delicious, our dinner outstanding and our room extremely comfortable.Javier and Kiki at the concierge desk helped us solve a ticket problem we had, and in addition, made reservations and appropriate suggestions for city destinations that we really enjoyed.   The personalized service is absolutely outstanding!
",5,2019,04,18
13,cannot say enough great things about this Hotel and the Staff,"The first thing you notice is how smartly dressed, attentive, polite and cool the staff is. You walk up to the nicely laid out concierge area and all staff stands up and gives you their full attention. Even when there are others being served you get the feeling that they are all there for you at that moment. Not easy to pull that off. The hotel is first class in all respects-service, rooms, food, everything.  It will always be my first choice when in Barcelona.",5,2019,04,12
13,Peaceful Elegance and Exceptional Staff,"Stayed here for 3 nights, and this was my first time visiting Barcelona.  The hotel is beautiful.  The building is old yet extremely elegant and well maintained.  The rooms (we had 2) were larger than I expected given the age of the building.  Each had a terrance and let in a lot of natural light, making the room bright.  Bathrooms and bath products were outstanding.  We had dinner in the hotel one evening, and the food was delicious and well executed.  Would certainly dine there again.  We spend one evening in the bar, which is cozy and elegant, with a great selection of gins and whiskeys.  What shines the most at this property are the staff.  Each person we encountered was incredibly kind, warm, helpful and accommodating.  The staff make our stay here truly memorable, and we are excited to return here on our next journey to Barcelona.  Thank you!!!",5,2019,04,08
13,Best Boutique Hotel [5 Stars],"e stayed in this hotel for 3 nights,
This is a first class boutique hotel, fantastic design,
A delicious breakfast, a great location, and most importantly an exceptional staff and service,
The crew members are dressed in soothing white, floating in the background and available to every question and request.
I was surprised to hear that a large part of the staff were students (from all over the world) studying hotel professions in Switzerland and were doing internship here. The desire for excellent service is very prominent.
One negative point - in the cotton room  they placed the sink in the passage corridor into the room, which is really uncomfortable.
In conclusion, the experience was excellent, and the hotel is highly recommended",5,2019,04,08
13,Beautiful Hotel. Gorgeous Staff,Never have I stayed in a hotel where the staff is dressed so smartly. Great hotel for business or leisure. Great detail to style and detail throughout. Stayed in room 503. Loved the shower room. Will definitely return!,5,2019,04,03
13,Great stay but needs a few improvements ,"We stayed here for a short break for our 1st trip to Barcelona. Great location and the interior was wonderful. 

The reason why it wasnt 5 stars is because the cleanliness of the bathroom was not very good, hair on the floor that was not ours. The shower door won’t close correctly so the water would go on to the floor when having a shower.

We had a drink in the bar and we had the most wonderful server, her name was Natilia from Mexico, she was lovely.
",4,2019,03,31
13,Perfect again! Pay no attention to bad reviews,"Love this hotel as much as three years ago and this time with 3 children! Superb service especially Beta, Clara, Tori, and Reyes who genuinely have the gift of serving. Excellent breakfast and lunch/dinner. Ambience in restaurant is historically charming and relaxing in the library. Love the cotton house scent so much we have the spray in our home :)",5,2019,03,31
13,Cotton House Hotel was exceptional.,"We had a wonderful stay at the Cotton House. All the staff were friendly and accommodating and welcoming, especially Reyes who greeted us upon our arrival and every day coming and going. We will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family!",5,2019,03,26
13,"Very nice hotel, very good stay","We stayed here for three nights as a Titanium Bonvoy member. I booked an Egyption room since it had a sofa bed for my daughter. The booking was a points + $ upgrade fee. We checked in pretty close to the official check in time so the room was ready. We were given two welcome drinks as the welcome amenity and I chose the breakfast daily. This was the second time I'd stayed at an AC and both were on the same trip (see Retiro review for Madrid). What struck us at first was the seemingly large number of staff in the downstairs lobby as well as the upstairs concierge desk; there were a lot of people and service throughout was very attentive. The hotel itself was small, but beautiful. It was definitely more 'luxury' than the Retiro though not quite the Alphonso XIII in Seville. Our room was on the first floor; 101. Honestly, it was much smaller than what it appeared in the pictures but it was what we booked. They had the sofa bed made up an hour or so after we checked in which was nice. We had a glass of wine and some lunch in the bar / restaurant. The food was ok: chicken caesar for me, chicken sandwich for my wife, pasta with bolognese for my daughter. It was good, not great; but we're not foodies so I don't that as a good indicator of the quality.

The room and bathroom were good. The thermostat was great actually. I know that sounds silly, but hotel thermostats in general and those in Europe specifically usually are not usable or not functioning going by past experience.

The room had a small patio enclosed by a wall. I realized that on the other side of the wall was the outdoor seating for the bar. I thought this might be a problem in general and for my daughter's rest specifically so I made some inquiries. The outside closes at midnight; the bar in general closes at 01:00. I asked to be moved and they did find a room on the second floor for us if we wanted it, and also offered to move us to the 5th floor the second and third nights saying 'a double move would be no problem.' The room on the 2nd floor didn't seem to be any better than where we were; it was right over the outside bar. So I told them we'd stay put and let them know about the 2nd and 3rd nights. That night we did hear some noise but it was a cool night and the crowd moved inside. Ultimately, I told them we'd stay put; I didn't really want to pack up or inconvenience them with the move if it wasn't very much necessary.

We had drinks each night in the bar: wine and mixed drinks. The service was prompt, accurate and efficient.

We had breakfast twice in the hotel. The only food out was continental and was all cold items. The selection was not great: tons of breads/pastries, several meats and cheeses, fruit, cereals, etc. A real continental. There were some sandwiches that could be toasted; I did this one morning and the ham and cheese was good. You could order a small selection off the menu for 5 euros each. One morning my daughter got some eggs. Juice and coffees were included. So nothing like what most old European Starwood's offer, but it was as billed: Continental. They did give it to all three of us each day.

I looked at the workout room and pool, each of which barely registers. I think there was four pieces of equipment and the pool was a small lap pool. But then again, my guess is they are big enough for the demand for them!

The only 'problem' I had was at check out. I wanted to use a Marriott gift card to pay at check out and the two folks up front had never seen them before. It was a short and dismissive conversation: I don't know how to use that. So I used my soon-to-be-cancelled AMEX Bonvoy card to settle up. I'd have liked to have use the gift card, but oh well.

Overall, this was a very nice hotel and a very good stay. it was much more than I expected after my first AC stay so I'm glad we picked this one.  When the weather is warmer, I think having any room on the first two floors would be problematic with the bar noise.  So my recommendation would be to try to stay on floor 3 or above if at all possible.",4,2019,03,24
13,Good but not the best 5 stars in BCN,Nice Hotel but service is way far what you can expect from a 5stars.They just don't care of you whatever you ask.Except friendly and classy behavior from Alice atBreakfast and Merce Barcelo FrontDesk.,3,2019,03,18
13,Oasis in the middle of the City,From the minute we stepped through the door we were welcomed into this amazing space. Beautiful furnishings and a coziness that Pottery Barn is trying to achieve but this is the real deal.  A nice blend of indoor and outdoor space as the library dining folds into a sunlit bar that flows onto a terrace. Roof top plunge pool with sun deck made for a relaxing spot to get away from the city hustle. Small gym facility if you are looking for that.,5,2019,03,16
13,The online reviews don't do this hotel justice......,"We picked this hotel due to the location but quickly found out there was so much more.  We have stayed at many Four Seasons but the service you get at this hotel is above all else.  Young and pretty are most of the staff and they always are asking to help.  If you do ask for help they take all the time you need to get you what you need.  The room was bigger than I thought and even had a pull out couch for our son to stay with us a few nights who is studying abroad. The restaurants they suggested were all so very good and easy to walk to and they take care of the reservations, even the hard ones.  If you are looking for a tour they will arrange it all. So many places to stay in Barcelona but if you are looking for a boutique hotel that is not too big and offers a lot of one on one service, search no further.",5,2019,03,10
13,Look no further!,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and remain extremely satisfied with the hotel overall.  The staff were all very attentive to our needs, and the room was well appointed and thoroughly cleaned everyday. The hotel is perfectly located- walking distance to many attractions but if not there are taxis immediately outside or the metro nearby.  There truly was nothing more we could have possibly wanted.  Thank you to the team at Cotton House Hotel for making our trip truly memorable and we look forward to returning in the not too distant future!",5,2019,03,06
13,Beautiful boutique hotel!,"Cotton House Hotel is an amazing boutique hotel! One of the best boutique hotel we ever stayed in. Everything is well selected and decorated, we were simply in love with all. The breakfast is served in a cozy space and it was also really good. The neighborhood is fantastic and very central. Definitely recommend!",5,2019,03,06
13,Terrible Service! Hallway Perfume Is AWFUL!!  Too Overpowering - Needs Dialed Down!!,"I would have given this a 4 star rating but the service was so terrible I couldn’t.  We checked in on Feb. 22nd and there was no acknowledgement of my Platinum Elite status whatsoever.  There was never any mention of points versus breakfast or points vs drinks.  

Later in the evening I reached out to see what my benefits were.  At that point they still weren’t clear.  The next morning we went down to look at the breakfast and decided we’d do that instead of points they had automatically chosen for us.  There was total confusion with the wait staff and they told me I needed to go to the front desk.  They should have been able to call the front desk to sort out without me having to go down. 
 
The breakfast buffet was OK but not nearly as expansive and nice as the one at the Le Meridian.  And the service was TERRIBLE.  Nobody came to our table and we always had to get up and ask for anything.  It would then take forever or they’d just flat out forget the tea, water, or ice we asked for.  

The only positive service we received was the evening of our stay when we had drinks in the bar.  Natalia took care of us and she was awesome.  Engaging, enjoyable, and very attentive.  

With the Autograph Collection I assume it’s going to be like the SPG Luxury Collection but that’s not the case.  They’re usually nice but somewhat eccentric hotels.  The perfume in the hallways and in the room was way too overpowering for someone that’s allergic to strong, artificial scents.  It was just too much and caused me to get an allergic skin reaction.  We cut our stay short and we moved to the Le Meridian for the next two nights.  

I'm not sure how this hotel gets such great ratings when the service is so terrible.  We won’t be staying here again.",3,2019,03,04
13,All around very good,"This is a very charming hotel. Service topclass, all areas, not least bar are very beautiful.

Rooms are not huge but big enough. We had connecting doors to children and 310 and 311 were great in that way.

Did not use spa or pool this time",5,2019,03,02
13,Stunning Architecture,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful and screams five star luxury as you enter the lobby. I absolutely love the restaurant area and having breakfast there every morning of our stay really made us feel like we were in Europe. The courtyard garden is another beautifully decorated outdoor space to relax in with a cocktail before heading out for dinner. My only reason for not giving it 5 star rating is that for the cost of the room it didn't quite deliver for me. Despite chasing the cotton suite with a little balcony the room felt small and slightly worn, especially the bathroom. For equal or less money you could stay other places and get a bigger and newer hotel room, however you wouldn't get the other beautiful aspects of this hotel which is again part of the experience. The location is good but I might chose to stay closer to the gothic area next time as we found ourselves walking there every day for the multiple food and shopping choices. It is walking distance to La Familia Sagrada though and it's in a pretty part of town that didn't feel to busy or touristy. Overall it's a lovely hotel and great service as well.",4,2019,03,02
13,"Great location, great service, good hotel","The Cotton House Hotel stands out for the great location (very central in Barcelona within walking distance to many major areas a tourist would want to visit) and great service. Our bags were lost and the hotel worked with the airline to track them down. They were always greeting people coming and going with very cheerful attitudes. Every employee we met with very friendly and helpful. The only reason that I don't give the hotel a ""5"" rating is that the actual hotel room for the price was not great. The room was small (which is common in Europe so that's not a huge issue), the water pressure was weak, and the bed was just average. Having said all of that, we would definitely not a have a problem returning to the Cotton House if the price was right. Overall we had a very good stay and this property would be in the running when we return to Barcelona.",4,2019,02,27
13,This has to be one of the most disappointing stays I have ever had,"I was travelling in Spain as my daughter is getting married outside Barcelona in April. The end of the trip included 2 nights in Barcelona and as I was travelling with my sister wanted to do something special. Wow - what a disappointment. Although the property is lovely in the reception areas the bedroom are literally too small to swing a cat - in fact even too small for a tiny mouse! The entry way includes the vanity which is very inconvenient and the bedroom had barely enough room to place our suitcases - but that was not the reason for my unhappiness. Old buildings have their quirks and it is necessary to make allowances. 
Where I was most disappointed was in the area of customer service - or the lack thereof. The reception team were totally disinterested and this had nothing to do with language as the 'young ladies' behind the desk were of obvious English heritage. After waiting for the 'young lady' to master the complexity of the reception system (apparently she had never used this before - or so it appeared) she told me that our room was not ready and it would take an hour to get it ready. This was at the check in time of 3pm!!! The experience was a downhill trend from there onwards - housekeeping was shocking - dirty glasses and cups were left in the room after the beds had been made - there was a constant need to call down to request the basic essentials of a 5 star hotel.
This hotel is in the 'Autograph' collection - there are some serious changes that need to be made to personnel before it deserves this status",1,2019,02,20
13,"Awesome Design, Perfect Location","Stayed here for a few nights on a business trip on the recommendation of a Barcelona local, and it was totally the right choice.  Loved the design of the common areas - the mix of traditional and modern elements makes it both elegant and trendy, not stuffy but also not painfully hip.  The staff was uniformly helpful, pleasant and fun - can't remember all of the names of the bar staff, but Luigi and the guy from Cadiz were awesome!  Front desk staff was also great. Location in the Eixample is perfect, so much better than staying on La Rambla.  

And the food at Batuar is top-notch - in fact, our dinner here was the best meal we had during our time in Barcelona!  And the croquettes are everything...

A few negatives - the basic room is indeed small, and dark.  I didn't spend much time there so it didn't bother me, but my coworkers had balcony rooms that had lots of natural light that were much better.  Also, this is not a business hotel, so you can't be in a hurry, particularly at breakfast - it's more of a linger-over-your-meal type of place.

I will be back....!",4,2019,02,18
13,Nice location and hotel design,"Nice platinum recognition with upgrade to a junior suite which I found a sufficient size and I liked the decoration.

The location was fantastic - I walked to all of the places that I wanted to sightsee at

The service was generally very good at the front desk, concierge and in the restaurant

Room service croquettes were lovely

Negatives:

The bedding was probably a bit light for winter

Though the hotel was quite at night, sounds of traffic were quite loud coming in from outside when trying to sleep

When I contacted the concierge in advance of my stay about booking spa treatments I said I had heard that if I book through them I could get a 20% discount.  The response was rather haughty and claimed there was no such thing.  When I was staying at the hotel and had used the ""spa"" which was just a room with no spa facilities, the therapist told me that she was from the Palace hotel on the corner of the street and that if I wanted to have more treatments, I could just book through my hotel concierge and get 20% discount.  I was hopping mad that not only could I have gotten 20% off as I had specifically mentioned (and that's quite a bit off a 180 euro treatment) but that I could have had access to facilities too.  I was quite disappointed with the Cotton House concierge because of this.

As other reviews have mentioned, attention to detail of housekeeping could be lacking

The water in my room was never replenished during my stay.  I had only two small bottles of water to last me three days - not ok at all.

When I ordered pumpkin cream soup from the room service menu they served me zucchini cream soup instead because they didn't have pumpkin.  They should have said when I was ordering that they didn't have that menu item.

Only one fully trained front desk staff member was not enough for the demand.",5,2019,02,14
13,"Tiny room, cheap remodel, leak in our room","We stayed at this hotel Jan 2018 and it was miserable.  We had a leak running down our bathroom wall for most of our stay due to showers being installed incorrectly.  You could tell this area has been leaking for awhile.   We both ended up with a repertory issue, unsure if an illness or due to mold in the walls.  They offered to move us into a room right next to the bar which we declined.  We were then told a suite would be available soon so we waiting for that.  The suite never happened.  We were eventually moved into an identical room on the top floor and offered a credit at the hotel.   We didn't have a bill at the time so we racked one up to eat up the credit,.  The bill still went on our credit card for a good month.   When I contacted the hotel again after we left we were offered something if we return all the way from Seattle.  This is billed as a high end hotel and it is far from that.  While it is a very pretty hotel and the staff, all very young, seem great, it is what it is.  A neat building with TINY rooms and a very cheap remodel.  I would never return to this hotel and am now concerned about all Marriott Autograph hotels being over billed as something they are not.",2,2019,02,12
13,Hospitality,"We were warmly welcomed after a long flight from Miami, Fla. The room was immaculate, clean and spotless! . Restaurant and staff were outstanding. I enjoyed the textile history.No other hotel welcomes you with Champaign and choclate!
",5,2019,01,30
13,Welcoming hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at the Cotton House. Although we arrived late morning, we were able to check into our room - so appreciated!
Our room had a nice view of the street and the Sagrada Familia in the distance. With the windows closed, there was no street noise.
The location was convenient for walking to many sites and restaurants. Every time we returned, we were greeted warmly by the staff. It made us feel like we were coming home.",5,2019,01,26
13,Very cute hotel...,"This hotel is more of a boutique hotel.  Definitely not a 5-star or a luxury hotel, but it is very cute and convenient.  Shops and restaurants are within walking distance.  There isn't a gym either.  We probably not stay here again since there are so many other choices around, but I do not regret staying here.  The staff is super nice.",4,2019,01,25
13,"Great Location, Fantastic Service","We arrived early in the day from a red eye flight from the US. While our rooms were not ready (totally expected) the staff jumped to make us feel at home. They offered all of us a welcome beverage and gave us ideas to relax low-key until our rooms were ready. The rooftop pool has a great views and all of us enjoyed a swim (or two). The food was great at the restaurant and the rooms were fresh, spacious and well appointed. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an better than average experience.",5,2019,01,22
13,Not a 5 star hotel,"I wouldn't say this hotel is 5 star level. We were overall pretty disappointed with our stay. The bathroom floors and walls were dirty and there was a lot of dust in the bathroom, there were holes in the window curtain and the curtain also didn't close all the way. Sunlight was glaring through every morning. We had to ask a few times for coffee refills and bathroom amenities weren't replenished. We actually stopped getting housekeeping services, it seemed all they did was make the bed and fold the towels.  No umbrellas at the pool, you'll just bake in the sun if you go to the pool. The gym was super tiny, they would be better off not even having one. No treadmill. Someone was in the gym when I walked in and there wasn't enough room for 2 people to be in there. 

If you stay on the 2nd floor, the noise from the restaurant is a bit loud. We were woken up at 8 am with the music. The Cotton rooms are pretty tiny. They have a unique shower, but otherwise the space is cramped. We upgraded to the Egyptian room, which is basically the corner rooms. They are larger, but the terraces are smaller. The Cotton room had space for 2 chairs on the terrace, where the Egyptian can only fit 1. 

Concierge was really disappointing. They recommended 2 restaurants for lunch in Sitges, which were both closed for lunch (we found out when we arrived). We were misdirected to the wrong train station and given timetables for the wrong day. The concierge wasn't knowledgable about bike rentals. Overall, they just weren't knowledgable at all. Better off doing research on your own. 

The location is decent, but I feel there were better locations. It's a short walk to Eixample and La Rambla. It's not in the heart of Eixample. I would have preferred staying there.

The one positive at the hotel was the staff at the terrace bar & Bataur. They are what made our stay pleasurable. I would definitely recommend visiting the bar & restaurant, but not really staying at the hotel. The hotel has a charm and interesting history, but the rooms and amenities aren't on par with 5 star.",3,2019,01,17
13,Stunning Hotel in Perfect Location,"This hotel is a masterpiece. The rooms are gorgeous, the dining area breathtaking and the rooftop pool a much welcomed necessity during the summer season. The staff were spot on with their restaurant recommendations (the 2254 Barcelona tapas restaurant was our favorite) and even helped send some clothes I mistakingly left in the room back to South Africa without any issue! I really recommend the yoga and Pilates they have on offer in the mornings too. Will definitely be back to stay when I’m in Barcelona again.",5,2019,01,16
13,Excelent Boutique Hotel,"This really is a great friendly small boutique hotel. Everyone from the doormen, front desk, concierge  housekeeping and restaurant staff were friendly, helpful & professional.   

I wished the rooms were bigger, but they were fairly represented on the website. So I knew what to expect. 

Breakfast was very good, didn't get a chance to try other meals at the restaurant.",5,2019,01,14
13,Great hotel,"Wow the hotel was amazing! We enjoyed every single aspect of it! The staff is absolutely wonderful from the minute you walk in the door! Reyes received us in a very friendly manner and helped us with the bag. Then Cristina was absolutely amazing at recommending restaurants, bars and sight seeing options, she also helped us book our tickets online, and organized them by days in a package! The breakfast was good, lots of options and the rooms comfortable. Dont forget to try the candy that they complement you with, its amazing, i tried buying some but is not for sale, they should bc its amazing! Great experience and would come back 💯 of the time!",5,2019,01,14
13,This is it,"This is a very good quality hotel located at the center of Barcelona. The lobby, restaurant and the rooms are very well decorated. It gives you a woww effect when you enter the hotel. I definitely recommend Cotton House to all my friends and family. ",5,2019,01,12
13,I Would Stay Here Again,"What a charming hotel!  We enjoyed our sumptuous breakfasts and loved the old grandeur-feel of the interiors of the hotel.  We also enjoyed a light dinner in the restaurant and enjoyed it thoroughly, even though they were out of my favorite soft drink.  BTW, highly recommend the drink Lady Cotton House if you like your drinks on the sweeter side.  Was so so good.  Beds were very comfortable.  The only ""negatives"" were not being told that breakfast was included in our room rate when we checked in (which we found out when we came to the restaurant the next morning) and the noise from the Main Street as our room faced the street as opposed to the courtyard (could hear motorcycles and sirens).  They did have turn down service contrary to past reviewer (perhaps this was changed since that person stayed here).  The negatives were small and our stay was fantastic.  We would certainly stay here again!",5,2019,01,10
13,Loved our Five Night Visit,"We had a lovely 5 night stay at Cotton House and had no issues.  As Lifetime Platinum there was availability and were upgraded and had complimentary breakfasts and chose a free drink for the gift.

The rooftop was closed but we took drinks up a couple of nights and usually had the place to ourselves.  

Check in was fast and we were served a choice of cava or water. The porter showed us the room and brought extra water for coffee. Very helpful.

The public rooms are beautiful.  We would visit these areas to relax and check our emails.  Even the stairway is beautiful. 

It was cool during our stay and we chose to have drinks on the terrace.  There are portable fireplaces that made our table warm and cozy.  Complimentary nuts were served.

Concierge was busy but helpful with reservations.  

Breakfast (without paying the extra 5 euros for eggs) was excellent. Many restaurants nearby if breakfast is not complimentary which is 32 euros per person.  I would suggest that wait staff tie their hair back since I observed one lady’s hair drag over a plate and most of the ladies have waist length hair.

The exercise area outside the roof top terrace is tiny.  Saw one guy with a mat on the roof top terrace.  Since we got a lot of exercise walking we did not use their facility. At least something is provided but don’t expect a lot of equipment.

The location is very convenient.  The Aerobus drop off is at the Catalunya Plaza which is a 10 minute walk.  We walked to most places.  Suggest if you take a taxi to the cruise port to walk down to the street on the left as you walk out.  Our driver took several minutes in traffic to drive down and back up to get on that street.

Not sure about the negative reviews.  There are pictures of the rooms and the hotel.  If one wants a bigger area in the city then suggest renting an apartment.  Our expectations were met by the Cotton House staff and we had a wonderful stay.",5,2019,01,06
13,At least reply,"How can we be insisting for more than a month, and no reply yet, for your LAttelier room that you advertise in your website? We had great plans for both us and your property to celebrate a special occasion but what a shame!!! it got lost among your staff who promised everyday a reply in few minutes. Too inconsiderate!!!!!!!!",1,2019,01,04
13,Wish I could give it a better rating,"The service personnel and especially the concierge team is about the best I have worked with. Pre-trip and during my stay. They were to a person welcoming and professional. Deserving of 5 stars.

But...

It is located in a charming, old house which has been refurbished. Nicely done but the rooms are very small. They are acceptable for 1 person, but tight for 2.

We arrived only to find that in both of our two adjoining rooms the previous guests (I assume) had opened (seal broken) the vodka bottles in the mini bar and filled it with water. Embarrassed, the hotel immediately apologized when informed.

The entrance and common rooms are charming and decorative. But the lobby is way too dark. The restaurant/bar is okay but a limited menu. I assume that during the summer months when you can sit on the terrace it would be much more welcoming.

While the location is good, this hotel simply is not a five star. Just little things for example turn down service.

Somehow, we departed reflecting on whether this hotel was worth the money (we had 4 rooms) and decided no. We will look for another location in Barcelona for our next trip. And I am sorry for that because it has nothing to do with the very good personnel.",3,2019,01,02
13,This was one of the most disappointing places I have ever stayed,"I have spent most of my life traveling and have stayed in a variety of places from simple cottages to luxury hotels.
I tend to look for the unique and special - and this time decided to stay in a hotel from the Marriott Autograph collection. In the past this has been a good decision - not so in the case of the Cotton House Hotel!
The hotel has been decorated in wonderful fashion and is a great place for a drink or a snack - it is terrible as a place to stay!
I had one of the 'better' rooms - Cotton group with courtyard view and tiny balcony! There was literally no place in the room to move - the entrance was incorporated into the 'bathroom' with a sink and two closets that were too small to put more than one person's overnight items. We were there for two nights and ended up having to live out of suitcases - not much fun. But that was not the problem - I understand that in a older historical building there are some space constraints.
The biggest issue was the overall lack of customer service - from check in until departure I felt that there was literally one bad experience after the next.
I had sent in a request for a feather free room - something that is in my Marriott profile but wanted to be sure that there were no issues. 
On arrival- around 3.15 - the reception staff appeared to have no idea of what to do in terms of checking in a guest. I was greeted with blank stares when I said I wanted to check in - not a language issue as there appears to be a focus on English speaking personnel - in fact several of the staff were very British. Finally one girl decided to try and check us in - something that should take a few minutes. After almost half an hour she said that unfortunately the room was not ready - they would now need to prepare it and ensure that there were no feathers - despite assurance on the mobile application that all was ready for our arrival!
That was just the first of ongoing issues - which included housekeeping leaving the room in total disarray - not replacing toiletries (2 people in a room need more that one item of each) - it was just one bad experience after the next. The only light in this dismal tunnel was the server in the bar who was charming and attentive!
All personnel appear to lack adequate training and experience - and have a very disinterested attitude. Most appeared to think that they were there for effect - rather than to serve guests!
I wish I had read through some of the other reviews on this property before making this booking - it seems that if you are in a preferred status with Marriott or Starwood - and make use of Award certificates (which reflect many stays and customer loyalty) you are penalized by a bad attitude and terrible service. Certainly not what one would expect as a Frequent Traveller. 
Suggest that Marriott take a good long look at their strategy for this property - it is certainly not a reflection of what one would expect of a premier brand!

13,Enchanting and lovely hotel,Probably the nicest hotel in Barcelona.  They have maintained the essence and history of this spectacular and enchanting building.  I highly recommend the cocktail bar and the indoor terrace for a nice drink.  The terrace is a jewel.  Lovely rooms and some of the most useful and happy employees that I have found.,5,2018,12,30
13,Treatment of a Platinum Marriott member using a 5 night certificate,"I booked this hotel early in 2018 using a 5 night stay certificate.  We traveled to Barcelona in late September 2018 staying at the hotel until October 4, 2018.  On arrival we were given a tiny room overlooking a shaft at the hotel - the hotel acknowledged my Platinum status.  After the first night, I went to the front desk and asked to be moved to a better room for the remaining 4 nights.  I never heard back from the management and left the hotel after the 5 nights to continue our trip.

On our return home, I contacted Marriott and outlined my issue.  They sent an inquiry to the hotel.  The response was only one night could have been changed so they didn’t feel it was worth telling me .  Visitors were moving in and out each day and it seems strange at least 3 nights could have been accomadated.  I am convinced that due to me using a Marriott certificate , I was viewed as a second class client.  I have never had this experience in London or Copenhagen where I have used certificates.  I have been a longtime Marriott rewards and Marriott vacationclub member and in past years used Marriott for business functions in Arizona.

I called Marriott rewards again and requested at least refunding me 3 nights (or points) due to the issue and experience my wife and I had at the hotel.  Several weeks later, I have still not heard back from The Cotton House hotel since Marriott Rewards contacted them for a second time on this issue.

I definitely do not recommend this hotel to travelers to Barcelona.  They clearly aren’t professional in their follow up and treatment of Platinum Marriott clients.

Rooms can be extremely small and unpleasant although I will admit the location is good.",2,2018,12,13
13,Cotton closet,"We stayed the end of October.  We are Starwood  platinum status.  When we checked in they wished my husband a happy birthday.  That was the last thing they did for us.  On the last night I called the  concierge. And reminded them I had sent an email  regarding his birthday and they said they would do some sort of celebration for a fee.  I said, “no thank you.” In the end they did bring champagne and balloons.  To our room,  which leads me to the next issue.  The room was not even a room. It was straight out of Harry Potter,  a closet. No real window.  Claustrophobics beware! I would caution anyone when booking.  I would so of enjoyed a real room.",1,2018,12,07
13,One of my favorite hotels in the world!,I travel the world all year for business (pleasure when I can) and I can say that this hotel is one of my favorite.  My colleagues also travel for work and say the same thing.  It's got character and charm.  It feels like home.  The people are nice and genuine.  The restaurant is awesome. What more do you want?  Only a few hotels will even get me motivated enough to write a review.  This is one of those places.  I would say top 3 for me.  Enough said.,5,2018,12,06
13,"Beautiful hotel, lovely stay","We were greeted at our taxi by Merce, who checked us in and informed us that we had been given a beautiful upgraded room.   We were also warmly welcomed by Juliette with whom we had several helpful interactions during our all too brief stay.  All the staff were warm, welcoming and helpful.

Our upgraded room was lovely, with special touches in relationship to cotton, since the hotel was once the headquarters of the Association of Cotton House Manufacturers.  We had a balcony, which unfortunately we didn't get a chance to relax on, as it rained during our stay.   The room was light and airy and the bed was super comfortable.  One thing to note in this particular room: we had a ""wet"" room with separate tub and shower, however the floor was very slippery.   We didn't discover the mat for the shower floor tucked way under the sink vanity until the 2nd day;  it would be more helpful if the mat were placed in the shower area as a slip on the shower floor could be a real problem.

We didn't dine in the hotel, but the restaurant looked quite nice.  We only wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy more time in the hotel, but we had much to see during our short visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,12,05
13,"Superb chic designer hotel, tastefully and artfully staged. Dinner was exquisite","I was a guest at dinner after business meetings. The hotel is delightful and the restauant located within a room displaying archive samples of cotton fabrics and extracts from order books or old ledgers (the building was formally the Cotton Trade Union Headquarters).

Staff are young, informal and friendly. No sign of any quality hotel stuffiness.

We enjoyed a selection of tapas-style starters - beautiful smoked eel, fine crispy slices of aubergine were highlights.

A main course of perfectly cooked hake, gleaming white, moist and just ready to flake apart was wonderful. Served on a bed of soy/sesame flavoured prawns surrounded by a creamy light sauce.

Judging by the beautiful selection of fruits, I maybe misjudged my deconstructed Strawberry Tiramisu, though the strawberry sorbet accompanying it was delicious.

The red wine (chosen by our host) was sensational - I suspect it was very fine and rather expensive!

Do go for the experience.",5,2018,12,05
13,We loved the Cotton House,"Excellent service / staff. Beautifully decorated property and rooms. The cotton “theme” is everywhere. 
Large room with a very comfortable bed 
Very good location close to Plaza da Catalunya.  
We had a great stay. ",5,2018,12,02
13,Overcharged.,"Long story short, they charged me at the bar which I pointed at the time of payment as it was different price on the Menu and charge was higher on the check. I was told by one the INTERNS from many which work there  that what they charged was correct as they  always bill same amount to everyone. Which is fraudulent.
I took the menu pic and the bill and sent to Cotton house via Facebook where they recognised the mistake and asked me to send them my bank account details so they can reimburse me. 
It’s been 2 months and no sign of payment a month  ago I contacted them and they said they will check with finance and come back to me; which never happened they never came back to me.

It’s not about the money anymore but the service itself where you served by interns who service experience is not 5 star but your bill is always going to be 5 star and overcharged.",1,2018,11,30
13,Beautiful Hotel for a Honeymoon Stay!,"I recently stayed at the Cotton House Hotel after doing a bit of research.  My wife and I recently got married and decided to do Barcelona as part of our Honeymoon trip.  We heard from a friend of ours that stayed at the same location for a work trip that this hotel was not to be missed and I have to say that we agree.  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering to stay here! 

The exterior of this hotel is nothing grand.  In fact if you are not looking for it you could easily walk by and totally miss it.  I say this not as a negative but quite the opposite.  There are many hotels in the city that have massive grand facades and 4 or 5 bellhops outside wearing shiny red jackets . This hotel is tucked away in between a few other buildings and the doormen and workers are always available, very friendly and helpful, and quite knowledgeable.  The heart of this hotel is the interior.  And quite a heart it has! 

Once you walk into this hotel it feels like you are walking into a grand mansion or an amazing museum.  Every single detail of this hotel is well kept and each wall and floor and ceiling felt like it had a long and impressive history while yet feeling very comfortable and warm.  The outdoor courtyard behind the dining area was very nice and had plenty of seating.  Our room was up on the 6th floor with a balcony and overlooked the courtyard.  The room was updated and very comfortable.  The bathroom was clean and updated and the bedding was very nice. 

We ate several meals at the hotel and they were all wonderful.  Because I have status with Marriott we also got the free breakfast buffet which consisted of pastries, fruit, cheeses, and meats among other things.  The amount and variety of pastries made it feel like you were sitting in a small bakery.  Additional food was also available for purchase which was very good.  

Overall we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone considering a stay here.  We enjoyed our first night so much that we actually extended our stay another night.  This hotel brings the reliability of the Marriott brand and combines that of the over the top finishing touches you expect in a city like Barcelona.  The staff is incredible.  The food was very good.  The location is great. They even surprised us with a bottle of wine and chocolates with a hand written note to congratulate us on our honeymoon.  From start to finish we had a wonderful stay and were sorry to say goodbye when we checked out but it was on to the next location for us. 

Pro-Tip:  There is a massage spa next door in the hotel on the corner called the Mayan Luxury Spa.  If you get a chance and want a nice massage while in town swing by there.  It was great and if you book it with the concierge at the Cotton House you get a discount. 

Enjoy your time in this wonderful city and make sure to leave some time to walk around inside the hotel and just enjoy all the details it has to offer.",5,2018,11,28
13,We loved it!,"This trip was a romantic getaway, and this was our favorite hotel (in our favorite city) while in Spain. From the very moment of arriving, they really make you feel special and welcome. This place felt like home, as its location is perfect for walking to some of the coolest neighborhoods and shopping, and coming back every night was always warm and full of smiles. GREAT great people. Reyes was always there to greet us with a smile every morning! Great guy, and since he is from a neighboring Caribbean island, we connected with him instantly. Laura at the restaurant went above and beyond welcoming us to the hotel. And the concierge team was FANTASTIC, especially Cristina, whose recommendations and advice were on point  all throughout our stay. The room was superb, as well as the housekeeping. Hasta pronto, because we are definitely coming back!",5,2018,11,27
13,stunning hotel,"stay here if you can! such a beautiful hotel, used to be an old home and it was converted to a hotel. absolutely stunning, and the service is 5 star. we stayed for one night after our cruise ended and we wished we could've stayed for a week!!",5,2018,11,26
13,Friendly service with a Smile,The Cotton House Hotel staff greeted us as soon as we walked in and every time thereafter.  Service is there number one goal.  The rooms were so nice and beds very comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding!  I cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  It is conveniently located and we mainly walked everywhere.  Reyes - one of the doormen was as friendly as can be and helped us with our luggage.  He was the nicest person and oh so helpful!  Highly recommend this hotel for a Barcelona stay!,5,2018,11,26
13,End of Cruise Stay in Barcelona,"We had just completed a 12-day cruise of the Mediterranean and were looking for a place to stay as we ended our vacation with a couple of days in Barcelona.  We were fortunate enough to come across the Cotton House in our search.  With a warm and inviting staff, courteous and professional service and amazing amenities, it was the perfect stay.  We dined there for one evening meal and breakfast and the food was as impeccable as the service and the staff.   Maria at the front desk was especially gracious and provided us with a quick tour of the property and its history.   Unique charm and warmth in the heart of Barcelona.  Highly recommend and we will stay again when we come back...",5,2018,11,25
13,Full Marks for the Cotton House,"We stayed 8 nights at the Cotton House for our 25th anniversary, and we loved every minute of it. 

We were in the Egyptian Cotton Room, and we had plenty of space - it was very comfortable. The decor and ambience were are amazing - historical, yet with the perfect contemporary styling. The hotel even SMELLED amazing.

The food was lovely, the portions generous. The cocktails tasted great and were Instagram-worthy. We ate breakfasts at the hotel most days (great omelettes) - but a few times we tried nearby Alsur Deli, which was delicious, the coffee amazing and the pricing a bit more modest.

Service was on point. The concierge team booked so many things for us - a food tour, paella cooking class, reservations at 2 Michelin-rated restaurants (try Tickets), a soccer match and massages at the neighbouring El Palace (virtually next door). They have complementary yoga/pilates 3 mornings a week - lovely. A special shout-out to Gigi, who served us on our last night. 

This hotel is centrally located, with SO MUCH to do within a walk. All the walking helped to offset the effects of the tapas, wine and vermouth. (Try Spanish vermouth on its own - very smooth.)

We can't say enough about the hotel - we look forward to one day going back.",5,2018,11,25
13,Visit to Barcelona,"Second time staying at the Property and it was even better then the first. From the greeting by the Doorman, to the exceptional check-in staff to the wonderful note left in the room by the manager the hotel is top notch. The restaurant and bar servers could not have been nicer and the hotel is just an exceptional piece of architecture. My only disappointment was that Jonathan the bartender was on holiday and I did not get to see him. The service I received from the intern Bartender from Switzerland on Saturday and the amazing bartender and server on Friday were second to non. I am a life time Platinum Marriott member , it would be hard to find a better experience while traveling. Thank you Cotton House Staff for a wonderful visit",5,2018,11,21
13,"Great ambience/staff, average room","Stayed 5 nights on points & loved the ambience of the public rooms, but the room itself was plain, with small windows to inner courtyard, so no view & room stayed dark.  Bathroom was very awkward - shower water all over the floor & no fan, so stayed humid & rather smelly.  Audible plumbing sounds from other rooms.  Staff was very helpful & location made it easy to walk to almost anything we wanted to see.  Breakfast buffet had a good variety of cold cuts, cereals & pastries, but hot dishes cost an extra 5 Euro, unlike our last stay at Gritti Palace in Venice which included hot items.  Would stay again only if guaranteed an upgrade or paying for suite.",4,2018,11,19
13,"Beautiful hotel, horrible service","Arrived in Barcelona to a taxi strike.  Hotel never told me.  When I arrived, called Hotel and they said no cars available.  Took the bus and walked 15 minutes with luggage to the hotel.  

Hotel is in an Art Deco building form the 30s, very beautiful and classic.  Room was nicely appointed, and small, not unlike a lot of rooms in Europe.  

Given a room and told that since I'm there for a long time they would upgrade me if possible.  No one ever followed up, no upgrade and no contact from the hotel at all. 

Made several simple requests for towels, having my room made up and similar types of things.  Hotel was slow, or non-responsive. 

Had several breakfasts at the hotel restaurant, which were nice.  Had dinner, and the food was quite average and the service extremely slow.  Would not recommend.  There's so much great food in Barcelona, skip the hotel (if you stay there) and go out. 

Finally, reserved a car through the hotel to take me to the airport because of the taxi strike.  It never arrived and the hotel was at a complete loss as to how to help.  Simply had no idea and it was a nightmare getting to the airport.  

Given the price, the fact that this is supposed to be a five star hotel, etc. it was a real disappointment.  The service was just horrible, start to finish. Not because they are negligent, but more because they are clueless. ",3,2018,11,18
13,"Great place, dinner unacceptable","We have had a lovely night out at Cotton House. It’s an absolute gorgeous place to stay, the ambiance, the personnel, the bar the cocktails, the architecture. All is lovely. But just one suggestion. Stick to cocktails because the food is absolutely under the limit. Actually never had eaten so poor for such a high price. ",3,2018,11,18
13,Nice hotel,"We spent 3 nights at the Cotton House Hotel. It was very nice. All the staff who work there are very charming & well turned out. We were welcomed with a friendly smile. As my partner is a Marriott member we were given a room upgrade. 
The hotel is very well appointed - soft furnishings, cotton plants everywhere, magazines scattered. One thing i didn't like was the overwhelming fragrance they pumped everywhere around the hotel. It gave me a headache for the entire time we were there. 
Our upgraded bedroom on the 4th floor over looked the street below. A busy street but couldn't hear the noise from the street in the room. The soundproofing between rooms however wasn't so good. I could hear every time our neighbours flushed the toilet or ran their shower...
The room wasn't big - there was just room for the bed was big & very comfy. (Perhaps the comfiest bed I have ever slept in). The vanity area & sink were right in the middle of the room next to the bed. With the wardrobe (very few drawers to put things in & limited hanging space) right behind the sink - not much space for 2 people to move about when getting dressed. The shower was behind a door next to the separate toilet. It was like going to the toilet in a cupboard. A small not very sound proofed cupboard at that. If you are a bit shy about going to the toilet in front of your partner then perhaps this isn't the hotel for you. As whomever is in the bedroom can hear everything that goes on in the toilet... 
In the room was a tv, ironing board, nespresso machine, hairdryer, safe, mini bar, dressing gown & slippers & a small bottle of water for each guest.
Well appointed rooms can only assume our upgrade was to a better view - rather than a bigger room.
Good location - easy to walk to everything.",4,2018,11,13
13,great delight,"This place has not only beaten our expecations regarding service and taking care, great rooms, great dinner place with lovely arranged plates and nice (midtown) balcony. The hotel is located very central to whatever place you may want to go.",5,2018,11,12
13,"Highly recommend....service, history, location....","Stayed 5 nights, service and customer orientation excellent.  Concierge team was even better, as set up a lot of reservations and tours before arrival, then a big help when here.  Basic room small like a lot in Europe, but functional.  Got upgraded mid-stay to a suite.   Building very interesting with a lot of history including a tour, and great location.  Fun outdoor deck, patio too. 

Every person very focused on customer service in every detail, highly recommend, and would for sure stay here again.",5,2018,11,11
13,Lovely autograph property,"Beautiful and charming cotton house !
Rooms are lovely - we had one with balcony which was delightful .  Concierge are quite helpful -
Restaurant is great for breakfast - lunch or drink in evening . Service is amazing - everyone is so friendly and attentive . Good location - walk to  many places in Barcelona !
Recommend -take walks tour to Monserratt !",5,2018,11,08
13,"Has everything you'd want, and we're pretty demanding","The hotel is in a great location, just a 10 minute walk from Placa Catalunya, where most of the tours meet, and a point on the way to La Rambla or the Gothic area. Even the Barcelona beach is walkable, although it is a bit of a walk. Decor is luxurious. Courtyard, in nice weather, is a great escape spot. Breakfast is one of the best we had in our two week trip all around the country. The room, and bathroom were very nice, with a comfortable bed. The best part, though, was the people that work there. From the doorman, who quickly learns your name, to the servers at breakfast, or in the same area (very comfortable and inviting lounge/breakfast area) for a late night glass of wine, were all very polite, attentive, and eager to please.  The concierge desk, shared by a number of young ladies, was very helpful, especially Molly. We would not hesitate to recommend to our best friends.",5,2018,11,08
13,Over The Top Luxury,"This hotel is one of Marriott's Autograph collections and, while my wife and I have stayed in several of these, all of which are excellent, the Cotton House is at the top of our list.  The location is ideal:  centrally located on Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, three blocks from the action at the Catalunya Plaza and La Rambla.  The hotel is a converted private residence that showcases the history of the cotton trade in Barcelona.  We had a spacious room on the top floor with a small balcony overlooking the courtyard.  There is a lap pool on the roof, the staff are very friendly, the restaurant, and especially the breakfast buffet is outstanding.  Yes, it's a bit expensive but if you are looking to be pampered for a few days, this is the place.",5,2018,11,07
13,Beautiful hotel that takes you back,The Cotton House is true to its history! Wonderfully kept with well thought out details everywhere. The restaurant transports you to the time of old merchants coming from distant lands. Room is magnificent. Would stay here again and again ,5,2018,11,07
13,A low profile luxury hotel,"We found this place by accident because we could book it using Marriott points.  It was amazing. Everything was sparkling clean and modern. Although the place dates to 1879, you get the sense of being in a hotel that was just recently completed. It was comfortable, quiet and restful.",5,2018,11,06
13,Resort style hotel in the center of Barcelona ,This 1800’s era hotel has the charm of an antebellum southern plantation (Cuban or american) with its rich wood furnishings and moulding. But you’re on the gran via in the heart of Barcelona. Request a room with a balcony facing the rear of the building (not street side). It was quiet enough to keep our balcony doors open for fresh air all night!,5,2018,10,31
13,Beautiful hotel close to everything!,The rooms are beautiful with comfortable beds. We had connecting rooms which is great for families.  The bathrooms were spacious (loved the rainfall shower head) and well appointed with amenities including bathrobes. Loved that the rooms have nespresso machines with espresso pods.  Rooftop pool has an amazing view -- especially at night.  From the front desk to concierge staff -- everyone was very attentive and helpful.  Complimentary cava in the lobby was a wonderful touch. I will be back!,5,2018,10,28
13,Might be one of the nicest hotels I've been to,"This hotel is really something special.

* the staff is helpful, friendly, and thoughtful

* the location is a bit off the main drags but in Barcelona that is a MUST given how overrun it can be with tourists

* the building is absolutely spectacular - every day I looked around and thought ""someone really had a vision and an eye..."" From the lamps in the dining area to the various end tables, the details are there.

* I arrived early, they took my bags, gave me a drink and then called me when my room was ready.

* the stairwells are so amazing and pretty, the rotunda after the lobby is the same.

* our room had a small balcony with these wooden shutters that were really great; we'd close them at night to calm the sound and they let the breeze come through, so splendid.

I really enjoyed the stay...The Autograph Collection has never disappointed.",5,2018,10,24
13,Batuar Bar and Restaurant- Icing on the cake,"We LOVED staying at the Cotton House Hotel, the staff was very friendly and accommodating; some of the best service that I’ve encountered. The icing on the cake was having a drink on their patio restaurant and bar, Batuar on our last night. We had an amazing glass of wine and loved our server, Luigi. He was friendly, knowledgeable about the area and even gave us recommendations for our upcoming trip to Italy (where he was from). Thank you Luigi and the entire staff, we can’t wait to come back.",5,2018,10,24
13,"Nice stay, except for this one thing...","We checked in to Cotton House for three nights after disembarking from a cruise. We arrived at the hotel about 10a, hoping to luck into an early check in. That did not happen. We finally were assigned a room at 3p, and told we had an upgraded room. Being Marriott platinum was a blessing as the room was still very small. The bathroom was part of the bedroom area with an exposed sink vanity and separated water closet and strange tub shower wet room combo. This set up was not great, as the floor of the walk in shower was extremely slippery. There was one very small plastic shower mat for the whole floor with a rain shower head above. The rooms are done in almost all white. Re the “Cotton” theme.  Comfortable but soft bed, nice bed linens and pillows.  There was a small balcony overlooking the hotels back courtyard below, so it was quiet. TV had only two English language channels, CNN and BBC. We ate a lovely breakfast each morning in the restaurant. Tremendous spread of breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, salads, etc. For hot items there was menu service. We had lunch our first day while waiting for our room. It was good, but expensive. Now, here is the only problem we had with Cotton House. The last night of our stay we decided about 8p, to go down to the restaurant for a quick bite of dinner. We didn’t realize as an in house guest we would need a reservation. This was a Thursday night, 18 October. We arrived, and the hostess seemed aghast that we would expect to be seated. The room was at least half empty. We were shown to the worst table in the room, right next to swinging kitchen door. This is how we were treated after spending over 1,000 euros as guests in this hotel. It felt like a punishment. Of course, we were told all the other tables were reserved for the evening. We quickly ate and moved into the lovely adjacent library area. The dining room remained mostly empty. The hotel is otherwise very nicely restored and the staff of young Marriott interns fun to engage. Location is pretty good. Walkable to the main shopping street and some of the main tourist sites.  A few restaurants nearby, but nothing special. ",4,2018,10,22
13,Kudos to the staff,"Our 3-day stay last week at the Cotton House was delightful.  The hotel public areas are absolutely beautiful (it was a former cotton barren's home) and retain much of the homes original architecture and style.  The staff was uniformly excellent, and in particular, i would like to recognize two of them.  Eline van Malssen worked in the morning in the restaurant, and she is midway through a 6-month stint as an intern with this Marriott property.  She was gracious, provided attentive service, and made time to chat with us to answer our numerous questions over the three days.  Thank you Eline!  Similarly, we had the pleasure of meeting 'Gigi' one evening in the restaurant. He is from Italy, where his family has been in the restaurant business for a long time.  He's one of those people who live 'out loud', as i like to say:  friendly, very expressive, and willing to offer insights into the local scene.  Thank you!",5,2018,10,22
13,One of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in!,"Cotton House is one of the finest hotels that I have stayed in.  Why?  (1) Outstanding staff.  I cannot even thank anyone personally, since all were great.  Nothing was too much trouble.  (Although thank you, Gabriel for suggesting that I visit Vielha in the Pyrenees for a few days.  A memorable trip.)  (2) Lovely rooms:  convenient, elegantly furnished, all needed appointments.  (3) Location.  I prefer being away from the cacophony of the Ramblas.  The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood, with authentic restaurants a short walk away.  (4) Ambience.  Old and beautifully designed.  (5) Great pastry chef.  I only ate breakfasts there.  But I am accustomed to pastry that looks lovely, but tastes like damp cardboard.  The Cotton Hotel’s pastry chef is a genius. 
 
Thank you everyone at the Cotton Club Hotel for making my birthday trip memorable and fun.  By the way, enchanted by the female staff’s makeup, I have begun to wear red lipstick.",5,2018,10,21
13,Great Lobby/Restaurant - Terrible Rooms,"Great lobby, restaurant and nice staff, but the location is mediocre. Not walkable at all. On a busy street in the middle of nowhere and the rooms were dreadful. Decent size but they feel like a motel in the middle of nowhere. Like 100 year old rooms that haven’t been renovated with gross, dirty furniture. ",2,2018,10,20
13,25th Anniversary ,"What a wonderful place!! We stayed here for 3 days prior to embarking on a 10 day cruise. Egyptian Room Suite was spacious with lots of storage and a large bathroom. Very clean and quiet room with a cute patio. Only knock I saw was that I did think the carpet in hallway should be cleaned or replaced. 

Breakfast was lovely with a wide selection of options! We enjoyed several evenings of Cava along with the most addicting “truffle chips” prior to venturing out for dinner. (Robata for great sushi and El National for just about anything you could want and great people watching/meeting!) Enjoyed talking with the CH staff as they offered great recommendations for eating and sightseeing! Luigi was amazing as he also gave us recommendations for restaurants in all the cities we are visiting in Italy! Can’t way to go to his grandmothers establishment in Napoli! Already talking about a return - and I can’t wait!! Thank you Cotton House!!",5,2018,10,16
13,Excellent staff and location,"The Cotton House is a very unique hotel with a perfect location for site seeing. The hotel is beautifully decorated with alot of wood and items from the cotton industry such a a whole room of white bolts of fabric in the dining room that is lit in a soft cream color. It is just so pretty. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and to meet any request that you may have. They really work hard to be friendly and welcoming. From the bell staff to front desk, wait staff and concierge everyone was top notch.  We had room 401 which was a lovely, quiet room away from the elevator, on the back of the hotel with a nice little balcony. It was so quiet and private. There is a small pool area on the roof with lounge chairs and a narrow pool. The gym is small but has a few machines and a few weights. Breakfast which was included since we are Marriott Platinum members was delicious and plentiful. Drinks on the patio and dinner in the restaurant was a lovely way to spend an evening. The service was great and the food was delicious. The only reason that I can't give this hotel 5 stars is I felt the bathroom could have been cleaner. Some scrub with bleach the floor would go along way.",4,2018,10,15
13,Great boutique hotel,"OK, I admit my decision to stay here was based on the fact that I could purchase Marriott gift cards with Amex points.  But we were pleasantly surprised at what a great boutique hotel this was.  Great central location for sightseeing.  Nice rooms, restaurant and service.",5,2018,10,14
13,One of the Best,"I just got back from Barcelona and most say this is one of the best places I’ve ever stayed.  I’m Platinum with Marriott for the last 15 years so that means I’m never home and I’ve stayed in a lot of places.  If every city that I went to had this hotel it would be the place I stay.  The rooms were great.  The bar was gorgeous.  Everyone who worked here was super friendly.  I wasn’t suppose to stay here but after a problem with my reservation at another Marriott property I had to quickly book another place.  I’ve never been so happy to have a reservation get screwed up or else I might have never found this place.  The “only” issue might be with the fitness center being a bit small.  Luckily I was the only person ever there when I was using it so it really wasn’t a problem. Besides...who goes to BCN to workout ;-). Do not hesitate to stay here.  I forgot to mention, it’s in a great location.  Walking distance to almost everything you’d want to do in BCN. ",5,2018,10,13
13,interior eye candy in the middle of Barcelona,"The room exceeded my expectation in every aspect, the personnel is super attentive and classy. Most of all we enjoyed chilling in the library or in the bar, enjoying 5 meter ceilings with stucco and panels and the cheers proportions of the whole hotel. A must see inn Barcelona",5,2018,10,12
13,"Service is 5 star, odd rooms","The temperature control is very hard to operate, had to open patio door as it got too stuffy to sleep. Very historic hotel, you can get a tailored short here for €275. It was once a cotton mill. Doors are so heavy my petit wife can barely open them. Room small but clean. The staff is wonderful.",3,2018,10,08
13,"Beautiful hotel , but small rooms, disappointing service","I'd found the Cotton House on several Barcelona 'top' lists and thus was expecting something great. The common spaces are beautiful. The front desk staff was very nice and welcoming so we were quite pleased when we arrived - but no one else treated us similarly. For instance, the concierge was brisk and unhelpful, the restaurant staff not engaged. 

While historic and charming our room was quite small - as a Marriott Platinum member I stay frequently at Marriott properties - this was the smallest room I've ever landed in at a Marriott property. Although I'm eligible for an upgrade - that either didn't happen or all the rooms are tiny.  There was essentially no closest and we were unable to unpack since there wasn't anywhere to put our things. The only space was a small closet in the bathroom with room for maybe 5 hangers - the rest of the closest there  was taken up with narrow open drawers -one for the safe, one for wine and glasses, two more that were two narrow to put things on. I like to unpack when I travel - instead we lived out of our suitcases, my friend with her suitcase on the luggage stand, mine on the desk.The room just felt very cramped and sparse. In addition - it was just dark.  Our room looked into an inside small courtyard that itself didn't have much light.  I can see the size working for a couple - but we were friends traveling together and were just on top of each other the whole time we were there. 

One of the reasons I'd chosen this property was for the rooftop pool - the pictures had made it look beautiful - it too was tiny - really it's just a short lap pool.  Although we understood that there was a rooftop bar - whenever we went up there there to have drinks out there wasn't any place to order drinks and no employees were ever around.

The outdoor terrace dining area is a lovely. lovely space. However, service wasn't good. Our first night we were told there wasn't room for us to have dinner so we sat off to the side on benches to order drinks and some tapas - there were long gaps in which we were ignored. I asked twice for a food menu - finally resorting to walking to where the menus were stored and just helped myself to one. We had to actively flag someone down to give them our order, and getting our bill to sign took more than 15 minutes after we'd finished. We did a ton of gesturing to get folks attention. While sitting there we counted 10 empty tables that remained empty - so it wasn't clear to us why we couldn't have one of them.  As others have noted the food was really expensive for the portion sizes.  Both mornings for breakfast we were ignored.  Morning 1 we sat for 15 minutes before being helped.  We ordered omelets, which didn't arrive for 40 minutes.  We think they failed to put in the order because we checked on them multiple times and each time our server looked at us blankly as if she had no idea what we were talking about and we had to re-order. We'd been told that while continental breakfast was included eggs would be 5 Euro extra.  I asked 3 times for the bill to sign before finally being told that we didn't need to sign and were free to just go - arghhh.  The first day we were there for nearly an hour and a half when our plan had been to have a quick breakfast and head off sight seeing.  Day 2 was slightly better although still very slow service  - we asked for the eggs to be 'well done' and 'dry' and they arrived soupy 20 minutes later.  This time we knew that we could just leave anytime.

In addition to being ignored in the restaurant we couldn't get anyone at the front desk to pick up the phone when we called down - each time the phone would ring, then music would play and we'd finally give up and just go downstairs to talk to someone.  Each time they did seem busy - but it would seem that they should have a process to at least say something before just being putting callers on hold. Again - front desk staff were great - they were friendly and helpful. 

We'd been so looking forward to staying at the Cotton House - but it was hugely disappointing. Yes, it's a beautiful hotel.  Yes, the front desk folks do a great job. The rooms (or at least the one they gave us) are too small, the service in the restaurant isn't good.  It just wasn't what I'm used to when I stay at Marriott properties- particularly not as a platinum member.",3,2018,10,08
13,EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS!,"We read all the reviews on this beautiful hotel well before we made a decision to stay here. I am a former travel agent who has a husband who has taken great joy in planning all our vacations for almost four decades. We can sincerely say the reviews lived up to what we experienced during our six night stay. We cannot understand how they are not the best hotel in Barcelona! As a three year old property, they have a few growing pains, but they dealt with any issue we had with swiftness, understanding, grace and kindness. The staff here are TOP notch! They made note of our preferences and that is the sign of a truly fine hotel. We loved our trip back to Barcelona, but this hotel in itself is a destination.
If you are looking for an absolutely lovely property that feels like an oasis, you have arrived. Long after you leave, you will always remember this amazing property.",5,2018,10,08
13,Great Location,"This hotel is nicely situated for sightseeing some sights like the Picasso museum, shopping and great restaurants.  The beds were extremely comfortable and breakfast and service was great.  I would rate it 4 1/2 stars except for the temperature control.  It was working fine until we were unable to control it from the room thermostat.  The front desk has the option to control from a central panel.  Once we expressed concern they released it to our control once again.  The hotel decor is lovely and there is a nice restaurant where you can eat indoors or out.",4,2018,10,08
13,"Yes, It’s a Wonderful Hotel but.....","All the positive reviews are right on the money: friendly staff, beautiful building, nice room amenities, etc. But the bar and restaurant are really expensive.  We spent €70 for a few tapas a couple of glasses of wine the first night.  Were charged €28 for 2 glasses of sangria on the terrace the next day (it wasn’t listed on the menu). Didn’t have breakfast there since €31 per person seemed a little steep.  Found a great little cafe, Alsur, a block away that had interesting breakfast and lunch options at a third of the price.  ",4,2018,10,06
13,Top Hotel in Great Location,"We stayed 8 nights at the Cotton House during our first visit to Barcelona.  The hotel is located in a perfect location for access to Barcelona's excellent transportation.  Just blocks away from metro stations and some key bus lines right at the hotel.

We stayed in one of the Egyptian rooms with a small balcony.  It was a great room.  Excellent bed (my wife wanted to take the sheets home), roomy comfortable bathroom, and quiet location.

We arrived on a Wednesday morning.  We were greeted efficiently and pleasantly. 
 The Hotel staff was attentive and made every request happen.  We worked with the concierge to schedule a day trip to the Dali museum via train.  It was perfect.  

The neighborhood has some excellent restaurants short bus ride or walk from the hotel.  During our stay we explored many areas of the city, near and far, and grew more appreciative of the location and the hotel.",5,2018,09,30
13,It’s a special hotel!,"From the moment we arrived , we were greeted by a friendly and helpful doorman to the friendly and warm reception from the front desk with a glass of cava this hotel has it  all! Yes, our room was not huge but very comfortable and with great turndown service nightly. The breakfasts were delicious and the bar and veranda services wonderful! We enjoyed the pool after a day of exploring Barcelona. The history and beauty this hotel has made our stay wonderful and it was close to many of the things we chose to explore in Barcelona. I would highly recommend and would chose again if I am back in this beautiful city. This hotel does everything right!",5,2018,09,29
13,Wonderful,"It got a rating of 4 because of “details” but I will say at the outset we love this hotel. It has character and charm and the staff are all terrific. We had the Cotton room and it was quiet with a nice balcony overlooking the rooftops of Barcelona. We were on the 6th floor with easy access to the pool deck which was nice. 
So details.... there were housekeeping issues. Thanks to Merce most were immediately corrected which was great and you can tell they tried. Little things like furniture with pieces of veneer missing are quality control issues that I would expect a 5 star hotel would pay attention to. Maybe I’m wrong. Once again quality control. The breakfast in the AM is nice although I question having Platinum members pay extra for eggs. If the hotel is listening, Laura the F&B supervisor is a GEM. Don’t lose her....promote her. She arranged a special Morning breakfast celebration for my wife’s birthday which was wonderful. And the days when she wasn’t there you could tell the efficiency of the breakfast operation suffered. She is a standout amongst a standout staff. We would definitely stay at the Cotton House again.",4,2018,09,29
13,Excellent Customer Service,My husband and I stayed for 3 nights during our trip in Barcelona. The staff were very accommodating and polite. My favorite space in the hotel was the outdoor terrace area. We loved spending time here for a drink as it was surprisingly relaxing from the hustle and bustle of the city. Highly recommend!,5,2018,09,28
13,Lovely hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed for 5 nights (couple). The Conceirge, Anastasia was very helpfu with our planning activities. The breakfasts were incredible...inside or outside seating! The personnel were all friendly, helpfu and accommodating. The room cleaners were friendly, effective and efficient! Beautifully clean rooms ,daily. The front end were welcoming and the doormen were amazingly helpfu! The hotel’s location is terrific...we walked to many of the sights!",5,2018,09,27
13,Not good value for money,"Leaving our cruise ship meant we had to arrive at the Cotton House Hotel rather earlier(10am) than the usual check in time (around 3pm). Guests have to check out by 12noon, so the staff said they'd give us priority and let us know, on our mobiles, the minuite a room was ready.
We bought a coffee; we went up to the swimming pool; we sat around for nearly 2 hours; heard nothing; enquired and were told it was not quite ready, so we went out for lunch.  No phone call was ever received.  At around 4pm we returned to the hotel and were shown our room.  No mention was made regarding the delay or promised phone call.
The room was adequate but nothing special.  There was only one chair on the balcony; a cupboard that only opened if you'd shut another door alongside it.  We checked on the web and found the same room at £180 /night but we were paying £400/night.( The following day, we looked at the Artes Hotel (Ritz Carlton) near the beach.  They only had a suite available and it was magnificent: 650 euros/night)!  Breakfast at Cotton House was not the American style buffet we had expected.  You could help yourself to a little of everything: cold meats, cheese etc but nothing exceptional.  Toiletries in the room were not replaced; we had to make do with one bar of soap to use in the bath, shower and basin.
However, the male Concierge was good: he recommended us to several restaurants close by, the Patagonia being so good that we visited it twice.",3,2018,09,26
13,You've got to be there to experience it,"This was a truly delightful hotel. The international staff were attentive, giving great service. It's not a huge hotel yet has 2 concierges who are magicians.If requested, there is tour of the hotel to explain its history. 

The hotel is well located and its serene ambiance was just what I needed. Spot on!",5,2018,09,25
13,Elegant stylish!!,"I love this hotel. A breath of fresh air. Wonderful staff, small but nice and comfortable rooms. The service from concierge and guest services brilliant. Location is good and breakfast is very nice, very good quality products and wonderful staff.",5,2018,09,24
13,An elegant hotel in a good location.,"We stayed for 4 nights in this hotel recently, using Marriott points. It is a luxury hotel with a beautiful architecture, right in the city centre, just 10 minutes walk from La Rambla, one of the more famous tourist attractions. Check-in was a breeze. The reception staff were very friendly and we were offered champagne. The bed and the bath rooms were surprisingly small and there was no view at all from the room but the beds were comfortable and the sleep quality was good. There was a coffee machine in the room. The wifi was free but agonizingly slow. The overall service was excellent, right in the Marriott range, except in the restaurant. In the neighborhood, there are quite a few mini supermarkets and restaurants. Overall, we were dissatisfied with the rooms and the wifi but the staff at the  reception and the concierge were excellent.",4,2018,09,21
13,Fantastic Boutique Hotel with a Phenomenal staff,"My wife and I spent the weekend at the Cotton House. It is a fabulous boutique hotel The hotel itself is small (my guess 40-50 rooms) and doesn't have a big expansive lobby or pool areas. Its a ""city center"" hotel with great history, impeccably clean and maintained.  However, what make its special is the staff. Every employee we encountered was friendy and happy to help. The doorman would run down the block to get you a taxi!  The concierge was incredibly helpful. Our experience with Kristina was truly specially, we wanted to get a table a tapas restaurant and it was booked solid. Kristina called for 2 days and finally got us in.  Great Job Cotton House!",5,2018,09,19
13,Great Marriott Hotel,"Stayed at the Cotton House Hotel for three nights. Two nights before cruise and one after. 
Staff is wonderful and very professional. 
Great location for shopping and restaurants. 
Loved my cruise but really loved the bed at Cotton House.",5,2018,09,17
13,No detail left out!,"We stayed at the Cotton House on the last leg of our 2 week trip to Europe and were so happy we did.  The service was unparalleled.  We were greeted with champagne, strawberries or mint infused water.  The architecture of the hotel is incredible.  The room amenties were above and beyond including a Nespresso machine, Bassols towels and robes, toothpaste, a shave kit, etc.  We had a balcony with a view of the city and terrace.  There's a beautiful rooftop pool and terrace as well.  Breakfast was incredible with a large variety of choices of meats, cheese, breads, fresh fruit juice, etc.  They ""goppysium"" (concierge) was always very helpful.  The entire place has a cotton theme since it used to be the home of a Cotton industry family.  We were so happy to come back to the room and relax each evening.  The staff always greets you with a smile..I could go on and on...  truly a top notch Marriott property - worth a stay even if you're stop in Barcelona for just an evening! ",5,2018,09,16
13,Lovely lunch,Gorgeous interior design and a lovely patio where I had lunch in a tranquil environment away from the busy streets of Barcelona. There were many delicious vegetarian options. Great place to have a meal or a drink at the beautiful bar.,5,2018,09,13
13,Spain Trip,"Loved this hotel! Highly recommended it! Beautifully decorated and close to so many things to do. 
Fabulous staff and very friendly and accommodating. 
Food at the restaurant was great too! Made our first trip to Spain wonderful full of great memories. Thank you Cotton House!
The Reef’s",5,2018,09,13
13,Gorgeous Hotel - One Of Barcelona's Best!,"This was one of our top picks for places to stay when we were in Barcelona, due to it's storied history and gorgeous rooms. Another plus for this hotel is it's central location. Any place that we wanted to visit was within an easy walk from the Cotton House. 

Everything from the building's neoclassical exterior, to the lovely lobby area, to the emblematic spiral staircase to the stunning rooms, this is one of the most charming hotels I've visited. We had a Egyptian Room, which was stunningly outfitted in gorgeous and comfortable linens (including hotel logo-monogrammed pillows) and had plenty of space for us. The small balcony overlooked the hotel's courtyard and surrounding apartments. The shower and bath amenities were lovely. We really enjoyed the comfort and style of this room. 

For a fitness buff such as myself, the small pool and VERY tiny fitness room were a disappointment. But, Barcelona is honestly too lovely to stay indoors, and I did runs along the streets and beaches each day.

We were so busy seeing the sights of the city, that we never got the opportunity to try any of the hotel's dining options. Next time we will take a moment to do that.

Thanks to the lovely staff here for a great stay! We'll definitely make a return visit.",5,2018,09,07
13,Easily a 5 star rating,"This hotel had everything you could want in a luxury hotel. Great room with incredible amenities, great service and an excellent location. The concierge was great helping with our daily plans. The shower is in its own room, a great idea. Loved our stay here ",5,2018,09,06
13,Where The Staff Makes The Difference!,"We are travelers who have enjoyed stays at some great hotels in Europe and the United States, but Barcelona's Cotton House Hotel may be our very favorite. The location is perfect, the building and public areas are beautiful, the food is special and the bright rooms are most comfortable.  But what makes Cotton House so special is the staff.  They are beautifully attired, universally warm and gracious, and always there with a genuine desire to fulfill a traveler's every need. Kudos to the hotel's management for the hiring and training of the very best hotel staff ""family"" we have ever experienced.",5,2018,09,05
13,Dominic,Dominic here would like to say a big thank you to the American guy from new York who found my phone in taxi and left it in reception a true gentleman thank you sir .not many of yous about .have a good trip,5,2018,09,05
13,A great surprise,"I have been  in the resaturant twice in 3 days for lunch at Cotton House as I wanted to double check and reconfirm my impression.
The place is very nice elegant but not rigorouse , classic but cool , old and modern at the same time with inner and outside table.
For luch they offer a set menu with varouse option which is really one of the best Quality/price I have tried. One appetiser or salad , one main (fish or met of veg ) one dessert with a cup of wine for less than 30 Euro. Very nice esperience which recomend. A la carte then the yhave plenty of plates , some of the Spanish tradition other more international with good price considering the location. Good wine list with acceptable mark up.
I will return soon for Dinner. Better to book as it serves also the hotel guests therefore may be full.",5,2018,08,30
13,Our hotel in Barcelona ,"This former cotton factory now houses the boutique hotel in the center of Barcelona 
We were originally meant to stay at the W a great hotel but not located in the best location  
This however is a 10 minute walk from every spot you want to walk too
The staff are friendly and all speak perfect English and a are treated very well indeed ,our continental breakfast was great 
The rooms are very simple but very comfortable and the bed linens heavenly
Great outdoor sun deck and pool on the top floor",4,2018,08,28
13,Silly good rooms in Barcelona ,"All the expected stuff - clean, comfy, even roomy rooms.  The building is historic; Nice blend of history with contemporary feel.  The staff is great, the breakfast is fab.  Avoid the interns at the concierge desk.  They are sweet, but are not from Spain.  
No happy hour.  And they nail you @ 16 euro for a glass on sangria!  Location muy bien.  

",4,2018,08,27
13,A wonderful place to stay,"My wife and I were traveling in Europe for our anniversary and ended it in Barcelona. We only had one day and one evening to enjoy the city and knew we wanted to stay here. The place was wonderful, we were greeted promptly and made to feel welcome. When we arrived in our room we were surprised to find a note written on the mirror – it was congratulating us on our anniversary from the hotel staff and it included a plate of goodies on the table. 

The room was well decorated and very clean. The food from room service was served promptly, arrived hot, and was delicious. 

The hotel is near all of the action and if we are ever in the area again we will definitely be staying here again.",5,2018,08,27
13,Fabulous hidden gem!  First class all the way!,"This hotel was a hidden gem.  Looks small from the outside, but beautiful light and bright rooms.  I was surprised to enter the room to such a modern and beautiful space.  The restaurant was very good, and the location great.  The staff was incredible.  Everything was A+",5,2018,08,27
13,Excellent hotel,"Great service, helped us overnight a lost bag, good location for Sagrada familia, park guell, shopping in Gracia.  Concierge’s all very helpful, knowledgeable, connected.  You won’t regret this place.

Pros: great restaurant, everyone speaks great English (if that matters to you), connected and knowledgeable concierges.

Cons: hard to come up with any.  This is not a mind-blowing experience but it is very good and good value for money.  A great place to stay.",5,2018,08,25
13,Excellence,"Part of the Autograph Collection this restored boutique hotel exceeded our expectations in almost every way. Located within walking distance to nearly all areas of interest you 
will be helped by one of the most welcoming staffs one will ever encounter. Do not hesitate to place your excursions and dining plans in the capable hands of these people. Rooms are adequate sized yet very functional. Nice amenities and pool on the roof. Will stay here again when I return!",5,2018,08,25
13,Lovely Hotel in a Great Location,"We stayed at the Cotton House Hotel for three nights before a cruise. The location proved to be perfect:  just a few minutes walk from places like Plaça de Catalunya and Passeig de Gracia for shopping and restaurants.

The hotel is a lovely, characterful old building, beautifully renovated from the days it was a club for cotton merchants. The reception area is most elegant. Our welcome was extremely friendly and accompanied by the offer of a glass of Champagne, and we were checked in with excellent efficiency.

Our room was spacious (though I did get a free upgrade) with a kingsize bed—very comfortable like all Marriott beds. The bathroom was a wet room with a bath and a separate (unenclosed) shower, which was fun.

Wifi is high-speed. I clocked 97.5 Mbps down and 58.2 Mbps up.

We didn’t eat breakfast in the hotel, but did dine in Batuar one evening (reviewed elsewhere on TripAdvisor). It’s a delightful location and, I’m sure, very pleasant for breakfast before venturing into Barcelona.

We have stayed in Barcelona a few times. The Cotton House has moved to the top of our hotels list.",5,2018,08,23
13,"Classy, elegant hotel in the perfect location!",We stayed five nights at the Cotton House Hotel.  The staff was very warm and they even upgraded our room.  This was such a beautiful and well-designed hotel.  We ate a few times in the hotel restaurant Batuar and the food was very good.  On top of it all it was centrally located in Eixample neighborhood and we could walk easily to so many things.  Would definitely stay here again if we have a chance to visit Barcelona again.,5,2018,08,19
13,"Upscale Property, Great Location","Wonderful experience at the Cotton House Hotel! Attentive staff, comfortable and clean rooms, beautifully rich public areas. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet, but did not have dinner at the restaurant.  A short walk from many of the downtown places of interest. Definitely worth the splurge.",5,2018,08,19
13,Class... Elegance... central location ,"A hotel full of charm... authentic Spanish architecture... very elegant and classy rooms... the location is top notch... it is a walking distance from Pasege de gracia... if you go to Cotton house, try to get a bottle of their home fragrance! Unique! ",5,2018,08,19
13,Honeymoon in Barcelona ,"Amazing hotel! Used points for our stay here and it was the best Marriott hotel I’ve seen. Very friendly and attentive staff. Amazing building and the rooms are spacious and very nicely decorated. Great location, can walk to several points of interest. Would highly recommend this hotel and can’t wait to come back.",5,2018,08,17
13,Honeymoon trip,"We traveled from the states and spent the first few nights of our honeymoon at the Cotton House. It was absolutely perfect!! The amazing decor, friendly and attentive staff and very comfortable rooms made our stay at the Cotton House so memorable! The rooftop pool was perfect for a relaxing afternoon after touring all morning! The location was very central to everything going on in the city, I highly recommend staying at this hotel!",5,2018,08,17
13,Wondering stay,"I loved this hotel, I cannot believe it's a Marriott, it has so much character. The service was lovely and so helpful. Room were clean and beautifully decorated. I would go back in a second! Do yourself a favor and eat dinner in their restaurant, it's wonderful! ",5,2018,08,16
13,Fantastic Stay!,"Our family had a memorable stay at the Cotton House Hotel. From the moment that we walked into the front entrance the entire team made us feel right at home. This is a stunning property, inside and outside. It’s beautifully decorated with lots of rich history, the rooms are bright and nicely decorated, nice bar and we enjoyed the breakfast on the outside terrace. Laura A., Laura G. and the entire team were amazing in ensuring that we had a great stay!",5,2018,08,15
13,Boutique hotel with fantastic location,"Really enjoyed our stay on the Cotton Hotel. Staff was very friendly, hotel is in a great location, and rooms are comfortable.  Add to this the hotel has an authentic Spanish feel. 

Also of note - Hotel has a lovely outside eating area on the first floor (2nd floor for Americans) as well. ",5,2018,08,14
13,Very unprofessional service,"Very unprofessional service at the bar next to the terrace, very little knowledge of the gin options not to mention the preparation of it. On a previous visit service was superb. The Hotel deserves much better.",1,2018,08,13
13,A wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Barca!,"Interior design is an artist's dream.  Beautiful from top to bottom. I was offered a glass of champagne and a tour of the hotel when I arrived.  The lobby is gorgeous and very welcoming as are the staff members.  Breakfast ""buffet"" is incredible.  European style with lots of cheeses, meat boards, fresh juices and cakes and pastries.",5,2018,08,07
13,Delightful Boutique Hotel in a busy City,"This boutique hotel was once a home and then the HQ of the cotton industry in Barcelona.  It is now a delightful hotel.  The staff was marvelous, friendly, and helpful to us.  The rooms brought to mind the traditional European hotel room (remember to put the key card in the slot at the door or the lights do not work!) but modernized to today’s standards and expectations.

The small restaurant served a good breakfast with very strong coffee to get us going each morning.

The staff was able to help us arrange visits to the Picasso museum and Sagrada Familia on short notice making our two day stay very fulfilling.  They were also very helpful and spot on with their restaurant recommendations.

We felt right at home.

The Hotel is part of the Marriott/Starwood system.  A delightful quiet respite in a city that can be raucous. ",5,2018,08,07
13,Cotton is the theme here - Beds are awesome!,"Beginning as a bourgeois house, Casa Boda, in 1879, in 1957 was acquired by the Cotton Manufacturer's Guild who added 3 floors to become their headquarters.  Hotel has a cotton theme throughout.  Location on Gran Via within walking distance of Sagrada Familia and luxury shopping.  Yoga/Pilates 9 A.M. Mon-Wed-Sat.  Restaurant offers terrace dining.  Some rooms have balconies. Check out the floating circular staircase and library.  We experienced some minor guestroom maintenance issues but the staff here is multi-lingual, attentive, & wear beautiful cotton uniforms.  Buffet breakfast includes pancakes, waffles, & eggs from the kitchen.",5,2018,08,04
13,Awesome But Expensive,"Really nice hotel with great decor.  More of a quite place with a laid back vibe.  Love the hotel, the room was nice but for the price ($$$$) wasn't really anything to write home about.  Beautiful place in general and would definitely stay here again if the prices were a bit more affordable",4,2018,08,01
13,Beautiful historical property with modern comforts,"Very stylish accommodation close to Passeig Gracia;

Ideal location to explore the city and stay in a very comfortable atmosphere;

My Marriott reward status got honored upon check-in and additional perks were a room upgrade and free breakfast, thank you;

Pros:
- Beautiful historic atmosphere
- Rooms, very comfortable and all amenities available
- Outside terrace

Cons:
- Rooms on the small side

Excellent recommendation when staying in Barcelona",5,2018,08,01
13,"Fantastic, wonderful hotel in great location.","This is such a beautiful place.  Unfortunately my wife and I were only in town for one night, otherwise we would have spent three or four nights here for sure.  The rooms are very beautifully decorated, huge heavy doors so the rooms are very quiet.  The room we were in had a wonderful balcony.  The breakfast buffet was extensive, really great options for everyone.  Service here is fantastic.  They have a very nice library/bar area where you can just sit, relax and have some snacks and a nice drink to unwind after a long day of sightseeing.  The front staff was awesome, super helpful in recommending places to eat, which we took them up on, and we were not disappointed at all.  This was really a great experience, beautiful hotel, beautiful staff, and wonderful amenities in a superb location of Barcelona.  A+",5,2018,07,31
13,Wonderful hotel and incredibly helpful and friendly staff,"Spent 6 nights on vacation at this property and everything was perfect!  Clean and stylish room with a great view.  The staff said hello and good bye with a smile each day that we departed and arrived.  We used the concierge service daily and their recommendations were informative and accurate.  They booked lunch, dinner, and attractions immediately.  They were also available frequently throughout the day.  The pool is small (as you can see in the pictures); however, the two times we used the pool, we were able to get a lounge chair.  Food and drinks are high quality and the servers are very professional and friendly.  Finally, this hotel is in a great location to walk to most of the attractions.  Excellent experience.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,07,26
13,Very Special Hotel,"Cotton House is a beautiful historic hotel with an extremely unique stylized feel. The staff was incredibly accommodating—the concierge floor is open long hours & the staff goes above & beyond to help guests. The common spaces (library, restaurant, sitting areas, staircases, etc.) & exceptional staff are largely what make Cotton House so special, but there is also a lovely pool/roof deck, gym & spa. 

Guest rooms are somewhat small (no smaller than should be expected in a large European city) but very smartly appointed with well-planned & intentional use of space. My husband & I visited as a part of our honeymoon & we were so appreciative of the nice gestures from all 4 of our hotels in Spain. Cotton House went WAY above & beyond what we expected &/or had experienced at any of our hotels. The staff clearly spent some major time & effort decorating our room—filling it with wine, candy, and multiple handwritten notes. We were beyond impressed from the moment we entered the room.    

Cotton House’s location is also perfect. Very central for all of Barcelona’s major sites (everything is walkable) but off the tourist path enough to provide a tranquil environment. Cotton House is one of the most unique & wonderful hotels I have experienced. 
",5,2018,07,26
13,Lunch ,"Loved this hotel, from the moment I arrived , beautiful old home restored and decorated ,had lunch on the 1st floor , amazing food , great staff and friendly , even got a 5 min tour of the hotel and its history ,, 
Don’t miss it when in Barcelona ",5,2018,07,24
13,We will not be back,"We spent our last night following a long Mediterranean trip.  I picked this hotel and booked a suite because it looked like a lovely place to end the trip of a lifetime.  We went to the hotel restaurant to grab some tapas and the host was incredibly rude and turned us away. I told hotel management and they were non-responsive.  We went back to our original hotel, Hotel Arts, for dinner instead and would have moved back there but for the Arts being sold out.  ",1,2018,07,18
13,Delightful Hotel,"Charming, boutique hotel in a wonderful location with outstanding service. The entire staff were pleasant, informed and helpful. I especially appreciated the restaurant navigation and reservations that were done on my behalf - nothing short of spectacular. Many thanks to the entire team at the hotel!
",5,2018,07,13
13,Disappointing Stay - Stay Elsewhere,"There are too many great properties in Barcelona, particularly with the Edition opening soon, to stay at the Cotton House.  I stayed in May, and had an unfortunate experience.  I am a Marriott Platinum, and for whatever reason my status was not reflected on the Hotel's reservation despite it being clearly on my booking.  As a result, I was initially assigned a small room and did not receive any arrival amenity.  Furthermore, the room I was then given was not properly cleaned.  There was dirt in the bathroom and hair on the floor - disgusting.  Then, the following morning I woke up and the room smelled horribly.  There was construction going on the next door, and apparently that caused the room to have a foul odor my entire stay.  I complained to the front desk multiple times, and was not offered another room or any solution.  Lastly, I have not been able to get the proper amount of Marriott points credited for my stay despite multiple emails.  Since I arrived after midnight, I was only given credit for one night despite spending and paying for two regrettable nights at the Hotel.  Stay away.",1,2018,07,11
13,Classic Hotel with Modern Luxuries,"The Cotton House is a reasonable ride from the airport.  Upon arrival we were met first by the doorman, a very professional person who spoke excellent English (a welcome plus).  The Front Desk staff were busy with other hotel guests.  So, the Doorman invited us to wait in the front lobby parlor, a very nicely apportioned area, and offered a drink and snack as we waited.

The Front Desk were also quite professional and friendly. And, they spoke excellent English!  Once checked in, a Bellman escorted us to our room, a practice that I have come to enjoy in European and Asian hotels.

Our room was quite expansive, the bathroom quite modern, and closet and drawer space pleasantly more than adequate for two people.  The room had a small balcony that over looked the hotel's out door lounge area.

Downstairs is a ""Library"" bar area with cocktail service.  One evening we decided to eat in the Library.  That was a treat!  Breakfast is served in the restaurant, which is where the bar is located.  We had the option of ordering ala carte or eating from the buffet.  Both were quite enjoyable.  In the evenings we partook of our cocktails either on the out door lounge or in the Library.

 Located on the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes this hotel is reasonable walking distance to many of the tourist attractions as well as good shopping.  Of course there are plenty of taxis and of course Uber.

The hotel's staff was quite friendly and everyone we interacted with conducted themselves with the highest degree of professionalism.  As an English only speaker I never felt uncomfortable interacting with the staff.

I will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,07,11
13,Keep away unless you have Marriott points to use,"Stayed there for a significant birthday celebration based on its price bracket and location. It was only when we checked in that the hotel revealed that its part of the Marriott chain, there is nothing on the website about who the real owners are. If you stay there based on those expectations then it is fine. You're not going to get a Relais et Chateaux experience despite their rates. That said, the staff are very well presented but are let down by small and tired guest rooms whilst the public areas that could generally do with a deep clean.
We wrote an extensive email that was ignored initially but finally had a vague response that didnt address our complaint but offered us one complimentary night. Having spent a considerable amount on our stay we were reluctant to have to pay more to turn 'a night' into a weekend break.",1,2018,07,05
13,Overrated Service,"Lazy staff who did not want to help with any enquiries from the breakfast experience to helping book a restaurant or even just general requires the experience the staff gave us was poor at best. 

It was a though we were an inconvenience rather than a paying guest. 

The hotel itself was beautiful but when mixed in with the service the overall experience was poor. We wont be telling anyone to stay here in the future.",1,2018,07,04
13,"Lovely hotel, excellent service, smell of mildew in one room","First off, we loved the hotel and the staff, the location of the hotel and most everything about it.  It would have been a straight 5-star rating if not for the smell in one of the rooms.

We stayed here for a night in two Egyptian rooms on the same floor.  Due to the location of these rooms, each was located at one end of the floor.  One room was perfect while the other had a lingering smell of mildew which was quite noticeable and never went away.  We did feedback to the staff and hopefully they've gotten it fixed as this was otherwise a top notch property in the Marriott group.

We checked in early after a cruise and while our rooms were not ready, staff took our luggage and emailed/texted us when they were, which was a nice touch.  The beds are one of the most comfortable we have slept in and we really liked the history of the building and would have taken a tour if we had enough time.  The staff were uniformly friendly and delivered a high level of service - the kids loved the huge lollipops!  We would not hesitate to recommend this property with the caveat that we hope the odour in that one Egyptian room has been dealt with.",4,2018,07,01
13,Great City Hotel,"A great hotel with excellent service from the staff. Food was good, a little pricey though. 

The hotel itself was beautiful and appeared to be in a very good state of repair. 

The bed was very comfortable and the room extremely clean.",4,2018,06,26
13,Cash stolen,"It was a nice room and breakfast was awesome too. But my cash got stolen in the room during the five nights stay there. The staff said it may because I put on the desk so the housekeeper thought it was tips! But the fact was the wallet was buried at the bottom of a large backpack, which wasn’t touched during the stay. No actions or apology taken to deal with it after we told about the stolen cash, bad attitude, they knew it happens!",2,2018,06,25
13,"Beautiful hotel with a vibrant, engaging young staff","We stayed one night pre-cruise. We were greeted at the curb when our car pulled up. There is cold, infused water waiting for you as you check in. The hotel is beautifully restored and the outside terrace is lush with palms and ferns. We did not venture out and had dinner in the restaurant where there were many locals dining. Food was excellent. The staff is gracious and accommodating. The Placa de Catalunya is considered the Barcelona city center and is only a ten minute walk from the hotel.",5,2018,06,23
13,Wonderful hotel for 50th Birthday,"What a wonderful hotel. Great location, a short walk from Place Catalunya, this hotel is full of character and history. The former tailor's guild of Barcelona, the building retains many original features, whilst only having been renovated to modern standards 3 yrs ago. We had an Egyptian room which was very well appointed with plush bathroom and walk in wardrobe which was kept very clean. The room decor was very tasteful based around the cotton theme. The common areas downstairs, (restaurant, library and lounge) had many original features. The staff were very friendly and the restaurant  /breakfast was of a very good standard. We would return tomorrow.",5,2018,06,20
13,Small Guest Rooms But Otherwise Great Property,"Location:  Excellent. Just far enough away from the main tourist areas to be close enough for ease of access but with less craziness and commotion.
Service:  Excellent. All of the staff, from the bellperson to the front desk to the restaurant staff were very helpful and on-point. 
Property: Excellent. The hotel was only opened a few years ago and so the overall shape of the property remains good.  The common areas on the main and second floors were amazing. Be sure you don't miss the library and adjoining original rooms. The restaurant was bright and airy. The bar area was comfortable. The outdoor dining area was perfect for afternoon cocktails and snacks. The rooftop pool and sitting area was popular with all guests. 
Food/Beverage:  Very good. Tapas, salads, drinks, breakfast, dinner, lunch. I experienced all of them and had basically no complaints on any food/beverage. Some things were above average and a welcome respite from the more ordinary tapas found throughout the city. 
Rooms:  Poor. . I booked something other than the basic room and something less than a suite. The room was much too small. It was sparsely furnished. Closet space was inadequate. Drawer space was practically nonexistent. Desk was too small. Furniture seemed somewhat mismatched. Bathroom was decent size but the tub/shower combo was all wrong. I requested a room move. I was told nothing was available, but the Marriott website showed otherwise. Disappointing. 
Overall:  Highly recommended. BUT be sure you book a suite if you are at all interested in having some room in your room.",4,2018,06,20
13,Terrific Hotel and Service,"We stayed at the Cotton House in May and June a total of three days for pre-cruise and post cruise accommodations. Our reservations was with Marriott reward points and our stay was absolutely the best.  We were able to check in early for both reservations and we were upgraded to very nice rooms.  One the Egyptian Cotton and the other the Vichy Suite which was beautiful. 

The staff was great and took care of all our needs and treated us absolutely wonderful.

We cruise frequently from Barcelona and will make the Cotton House our hotel of choice in the future.  No complaints from us about anything.",5,2018,06,20
13,Superb,"The hotel itself is gorgeous. Booked two rooms which were both spacious and well appointed.  The rooms were sleek and modern. The public spaces were were beautiful.

The hotel staff were very friendly and courteous. They were happy  to converse with us in Spanish or English.   In particular, we received tremendous help from Claudia and Marta. They helped us book tickets to various museums. Overall the hotel staff were extraordinary and amiable.  

We will certainly be staying at this hotel again next time were in Barcelona.",5,2018,06,19
13,"Very nice hotel, great staff","We spent two nights here.  The hotel is very nice, luxurious, in a very nice area of Barcelona.  The entire staff is superb, very caring and helpful.  The hotel is part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection.  Rooms are well appointed, and very clean.",5,2018,06,18
13,Don't stay on points,"This is a lovely hotel in a great location. Complimentary cava, snacks, and water in the lobby. The breakfast was terrific.

However, we booked on points, so we were given a handicap accessible room with a view of a brick interior corridor. This concierge confirmed that booking on points was the reason we were given that room.

The bathroom was a huge problem as it was completely flat and the drains were on both sides, so there was no way to shower without flooding the entire floor.

We had been traveling for a week, and had some laundry to be done. I asked if there was a wash and fold service nearby. I was given directions to a 24 hour location. We got there to discover that it was lockers and you had to order service from your phone. This wouldn't work with our international numbers, so I used a bunch of data setting up an account online. Then we saw the notice that it would take 48 hours to get our clothes back, which wouldn't work with our departing flight.

I returned to the hotel. We inquired about just having 4 pairs of pants laundered. We were told this was impossible as the next day was Sunday, and they couldn't get them back to us by Monday morning.

At this point, I had to resort to washing these clothes in the shower, which only further emphasized how unhappy I was about the room assignment. We complained, and they did offer to change our room, but at that point, it would've taken too much time, and we had a packed agenda in Barcelona. They also confirmed that they were well aware of the problems with the shower in that room.

They did send a nice gift set and plate of sweets to our room, and they paid for a private car to the airport.

However, the need for this could've been avoided if they'd just found a way to wash my four pairs of pants. At a hotel of this level, I would expect someone to take them home and launder themselves before telling a Gold member it was impossible.

Also telling is this is the first time I've stayed at a Marriott in recent memory where I didn't receive a post-stay survey. They knew there was a problem, and they didn't want to hear about it.

I lived in Barcelona for 2 years, so any time a friend or colleague is traveling there, I am asked for recommendations. Unfortunately, despite the lovely amenities, I cannot recommend The Cotton House due to the lack of service.",4,2018,06,18
13,Excellent stay.. staff couldn't be nicer,"Everything about this hotel is top notch.  My wife and I both agree this is where we will be staying everytime we come to Barcelona..  The staff, OMG.. so well trained.  And I think they sincerely care about you.  For example, whenever i need a cab, they would run to the end of the block to hail a taxi for me.  Not just one person, everyone of them...  And they don't walk, they run....I am from New York.  I don't see any hotel in NYC who does that..  highly recommend this hotel..",5,2018,06,16
13,Luxurious boutique hotel,"What a hotel. I loved it right away. The building used to be the  headquarters of the Association of Cotton House Manufacturers. The staff was friendy, professional and very helpful. My room (Madras) was understatement as its best. No oppulence or whatsoever but only materials and decorations of highest quality. Especially the bed was excellent. It was hard to get up in the morning - heavenly. The bathroom was separated between toilet and shower and bathtumb. Lovely set up - wild old style belle epoque glass doors.

The set up of the roof top was very well done and thought through. The atmosphere up there was very private and exclusive.

The whole hotel reflects luxury and savoir vivre as its best. Well done - I'll come again. ",5,2018,06,14
13,Beautiful botique hotel in the heart of the city,"We had a wonderful stay at the Cotton House. Not a large hotel, but grand in a small way. Old world elegance with a modern touch. The staff was very helpful, especially Claudia who gave us much information as far as day to day travels and activities in Barcelona. The hotel itself is beautiful with quite a history. The rooms were clean, decorated in a neutral decor, but very small. Not a lot of room to walk around. The bath facilities were separate instead of in one room. The shower and tub were separate from the toilet. The sink was also separate, in the hallway. We had a Cotton room with a balcony overlooking the terrace. We spent a lot of time on it. Overall, it was a good stay.",4,2018,06,12
13,Top line hotel,"Ok, so this hotel is pretty pricey, but it's totally worth it! Everyone here was incredibly nice and helpful. We had a suite, because we were traveling with our two kids and needed a little extra room. Everything was incredibly clean and nice. I was worried it was a little too nice to be there with two little kids (they can be a bit unruly), but no one complained and the staff were incredibly kind to them - offering them treats and drinks. The pool is very small, but really perfect for kids. Our five year old son could touch the bottom, so was able to be in alone and cool off. Had to jump in with the three year old, but it was a nice break from the heat anyway. We also met several very nice people staying here! It's about a 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe and La Cuitadelle and maybe 15 minutes to El Born, which has lots of botiques and restaurants. We were especially impressed with Emma Paoletta and Tacha Cornelis, who were super helpful every time we needed anything.",5,2018,06,12
13,Old world charm with contemporary style,"I came to BCA only for a few days and booked a room based on the reviews. 

Although it was only for one night, I enjoyed all the luxuries that the hotel had to offer. 

I stayed on the top floor which had a terrace and view of the city. I was also in close proximity to the rooftop pool, which was calming an tranquil. 

The library and lounge area had a fantastic sense of design and scale as well as a rich history. 

My room was clean and airy but with a soft large bed that I wanted to sleep in all day. 

In the morning, I signed up for AM yoga, which was a great treat. 

The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and kind.",5,2018,06,11
13,Amazing Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"As a Marriott Lifetime Platinum Elite member, my wife and I have had the opportunity to stay in many amazing hotels throughout the world – both with Marriott and with other organizations – but we are in agreement that our five-night stay at the Cotton House Hotel ranks as one of our top experiences.

This boutique hotel, centrally located in Barcelona, is absolutely beautiful and is within walking distance of many of the attractions that bring you to this city. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. Although the facility itself is amazing, it is the staff and their service that will bring you back.
 
The excellent service for us began months before we arrived. From questions regarding baggage storage to assistance in planning our itinerary while in Barcelona, the Cotton House staff provided outstanding support. 
 
Upon our arrival for check-in we were greeted by the amazing reception desk team, all of who provided wonderful service throughout our stay. They were always available to provide whatever assistance we required.
 
The concierge provided excellent service - restaurant recommendations and reservations, direction to points of interest in and around Barcelona, as well as assistance in the booking of tours.

Our trip was made that much more enjoyable thanks to the excellent Cotton House Hotel and their outstanding staff.",5,2018,06,11
13,Beautiful Hotel,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Cotton House for four nights.  From the moment our taxi dropped us, the attention to service was impeccable.  I have been a Marriott Platinum member for years and this has to be one of the most beautiful properties I have ever stayed out.   Cotton House is paradise in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Barcelona. A wonderful escape to recharge and get ready to see the sites.  I would highly recommend AND upgrading to a room with a balcony -- it was simply, Perfection!",5,2018,06,09
13,Great Barcelona Hotel,"I chose this hotel due to my preference for Marriott hotels, but I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  This is a convenient location in Barcelona, but a few blocks from the noisy areas of the city.

The service is what distinguishes this hotel.  We were impressed by the check-in staff, the bell staff, the concierge staff, and the bar/restaurant staff.  This 83 room hotel has two concierges....incredible.  The concierge was great...made tour reservations for us and recommended some great hotels.  The only marginal service was the room cleaning...OK, but not great.  The staff at the hotel are consistently professional, courteous, friendly, and engaging.

The Cotton brand is elegant and appropriate for this elegant hotel.

At our last night, we enjoyed a drink at the bar and enjoyed meeting a young Navy couple serving our country abroad.

Great stay!",5,2018,06,08
13,Expected Better,"The hotel was frankly a disappointment though one must expect Marriott Autogragh Collection hotels to present a wide variance.  Room very small, very little grandeur to any part of the hotel. Everything felt cramped. Front desk personnel very friendly and hotel in very good location, and in-house hotel food better than average.  Of course the room was very clean, bed excellent, staff professional.  I need more elbow room and open spaces.  Can’t recommend it.",3,2018,06,07
13,Very nice hotel,"I liked this hotel a lot. They have a yoga class, decent rooms, and nice breakfast. I just hoped the room to be a bit bigger, but I assumed the rooms were small like New York ones. The hotel is located at very nice neighborhood and it's convenient to walk to most stations and touristic places. The staff was nice as well.",4,2018,06,07
13,Wow!  One of the best boutique hotels in the world. ,"The best staff every department I’ve ever encountered. From the time we stepped out of our cab all the way through check out, this staff was absolutely phenomenal. Rooms were not huge but were beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable. We enjoyed the restaurant and bar several times and the service was second to none during our 10 day trip across Spain and Italy. This is an excellent hotel that I give my highest possible testimony. We very much look forward to visiting again. Great job everyone at The Cotton House and thank you for making our visit great!!",5,2018,06,05
13,Historic Hotel but has It's Limitations,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Booked on points. Platinum Elite member.
 
Checked in on Memorial day and indeed the hotel was fully booked. Room wasn't ready by 3:00pm. Had to wait 30+ minutes for them to get me a room cleaned up while being jet legged on a ten hour flight. 
Tried to push for an upgraded room politely but failed, was offered two drink coupons. Asked if it is possible to upgrade next day and was told to be put on a waitlist. First time I have ever heard that a Platinum needs to be on a waitlist. I feel the staff is trying to discourage you from asking and hope you forget or just give up.

To be honest, the standard is pretty good with double sinks. All missing was a tub and view since it was facing the alley of nothing. The breakfast spread is great, hot plates are $5 each which is quite reasonable. 

Went down next morning to ask for the upgrade. Yes as a platinum you would happen to check the website for available rooms each day and everything is available. 

Was told she needs to ask the manager and get back to me. This was quite annoying since we had a full day outside and wanted to move our stuff in the morining. Came back in the evening to request the upgrade for the third time and got the Egyptian room. The upgraded room I got still had no tubs and the bathroom was half the size of a standard room with one sink. The closet is twice the size in length which is quite useless since you still have problems opening up your luggage. In addition, a sofa bed with street view. Unless you have a third person, I really don't feel the need for a room upgrade unless its a suite, since total size felt/is the same for Egyptian room.

This was my first time in Barcelona and location is a big factor. You are paying for the location of a boutique hotel with maybe Cat 6-7 room and service.

If location wasn't a factor, I would choose Hotel Arts Ritz next time which has good cash rates.

Pros:
Location is good
Super fast wifi at 60m/60m speed
Historical hotel with good ambience
Breakfast spread

Cons
1. Small room even for an Egyptian room
2. The smallest gym I have even seen. 3 people max?
3. Had to push hard for an upgrade which found out wasn't worth the effort.",4,2018,06,05
13,Beautiful Hotel,"I want to start by saying that we are very loyal Marriott customers and anytime there is a nice Marriott in the city we're visiting, we really like to book it and enjoy the benefits of being a Platinum Elite member. I do want to say that the hotel itself is beautiful. The dining area, the terrace, the pool, the check-in - all really beautifully designed and special. We were offered champagne upon check-in as well, which was lovely. We were also excited to hear that we had been upgraded, which was exciting, as the rooms are not cheap and we were excited to see what an upgrade would hold! The room was really nice with a balcony overlooking the terrace, however, it did need a little TLC. The shower had really dirty grout, the sheets both nights were not up to par with a Cat 9 hotel. On the first night, they were dirty, so I left out the card for them to be changed. The next night, they were torn and stained as well. The towels were also stained (looked to be makeup/lipstick) so that was disappointing. Overall, the staff was wonderful and sweet, the location was really perfect and the communal spaces were beautiful. However, we felt the rooms for the price should really have been cleaner and better taken care of overall. We'd definitely like to come back to Cotton House on our next stay in Barcelona!",4,2018,06,05
13,Disappointing experience,"A recent stay at the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona was extremely disappointing. Although the location was great, and the staff very welcoming and polite, the room and facilities for a €400 - €500 per night experience left much to be desired. To make matters worse, I spent several days wrangling with the hotel to try to get them to release the pre-authorised funds back to my credit card. These were still not showing in my account five days after I had returned home.

Following our stay at the Cotton House Hotel the management requested that I sent feedback to them, below is content from the email I sent. A week has passed and I still have not had any acknowledgement or response.

Four months ago we decided that we were going to have a very special break away to celebrate my husband’s 60th birthday and my 50th birthday. On a previous visit to Barcelona we had enjoyed a breakfast at your hotel and because we knew we didn’t want to stay at a ‘chain’ we decided to book a room at The Cotton House. Having seen the type of accommodation we would get at your competitor’s hotels (as an example, The Meridian were offering suites for €400) we could only begin to imagine the comfort that the Cotton House Hotel would offer in a room at a similar price. 

When we arrived we were surprised to be asked if we wanted to become a member of the Marriot points programme. This was the first indication that the Cotton House was part of a chain, not something mentioned on your website. As the receptionist took our credit card we were told that in addition to over €1900 for our accommodation, the hotel would debit an additional €400 as a charge for potential incidentals. This gave us a bad feeling because I instantly felt that the hotel did not trust its guests. I am a seasoned traveller, and in all the hotels I have ever stayed in, only an imprint of the card has been taken, never money debited from my account. The receptionist reassured that this would be refunded on departure, but as it turned out the refund was bundled into the final bill and three days later my account is still missing over €2300.

Upon check-in your receptionist informed us that we had been given an upgrade so we were full of anticipation to see the luxurious room we would be staying in, at €400 - €500 per night!

The porter showed us to our room and our hearts sunk. The upgraded room, was in fact a room with a sink in the passageway and very little space. A single armchair meant that either my husband or myself would have to perch on the bed or stool if we wanted to watch the TV or enjoy a drink in our room together.

I went to use a tissue to find that there was only a single sheet in the box. I went to wash my hands but there was no soap in the sink in the passageway to the bedroom. Neither, was there any in the wet room. The housekeeper’s trolley was permanently left parked outside our room from morning to the end of the day, every day. This was a real eye sore, but at least meant we could help ourselves to those items that were missing from our room!

Sadly, that was not the end of it: After a shower I discovered there was no bath mat. We went to use what we expected would be ‘luxurious’ cotton robes. Instead they were thin, uncomfortable and so small through shrinkage that the arms only came to my husband’s elbow. Towelling was minimal and certainly very standard given the hotels repeated references to cotton. As I sat on the bed, I noticed two holes in the sheet but as a card beside the bed told me that the sheet would be replaced the next day, I wanted to think of positive things and not complain. Unfortunately, over the 4 days the same top sheet with its holes remained unchanged.

Over the coming days numerous other disappointments came to our attention.
	•	The bed sidelight shades were broken
	•	The draw with the safe fell off its hinges, blocking the exit from the room, (surely a fire hazard?)
	•	Some of the cupboard handles were broken
	•	The sink plug didn’t allow water to drain without removing it entirely
	•	We enjoyed a drink in our room but it took 2 days before the glasses were cleaned
	•	Despite paying over €400 a night we were told that should we want an egg for breakfast we would need to pay more!
	•	Just 2 teabags were left in the room as part of your complimentary package, whilst the milk was two economy UHT single serve pots.
	•	On our return to the hotel after a hot day out, I asked for ice to be sent to the room. The receptionist told me that there would be a €5 charge.
	•	The carpet outside the lifts on the 4th floor was dirty, stained and worn.
	•	The toaster at breakfast didn’t work on two out of the four mornings we had breakfast.
	•	There were no sun shades at the roof top pool.
	•	The towel supply at the roof top pool had run out.

Our Barcelona break is over and rather than memories of a fantastic birthday celebration, we are instead reliving this experience as we list the shortfalls. The gesture of a 20% refund, although kind, will never alter the disappointing experience we have had at the Cotton House Hotel.

With all of the above said, the one positive comment we can offer is that all of your staff were attentive and helpful throughout.",2,2018,06,04
13,Beautifuly Designed,"Even if you don't stay at The Cotton House Hotel - its worth it to go inside and take a look.  Add it to your must see list.  Wow - what a beautifully designed hotel that manages to meld flawlessly the historic and contemporary. Hats off to the designer.
We were lucky enough to spend 3 amazing nights in the Damask Suite - a spectacular room. 
Believe it or not, the staff complemented the space - the concierge that managed to get us into the best restaurant in town with a few hours notice, the parade of staff that entered the room with a birthday cake and wine within minutes of our arrival, and the lovely ladies greeting us in the morning breakfast room in there flowing white dresses.
A very magical place to stay while in Barcelona. 
Minor issues ( my name is call me fussy) -
1) A missed turn down service one night.
2)The roof top pool was a little untidy - there should be an attendant there to clean up and take orders for cocktails, etc.
3) Not a lot of hanging space - only about 18' in one of the best rooms in the hotel.  Beware heavy packers like myself - I was on a 2 week tour - lots of hanging and big suitcases.
* All in all an amazing hotel that I would return to in a second.",5,2018,06,03
13,Above and beyond service,"We arrived earlier into Barcelona well before check in, and they let us freshen up and helped to expedite our room! They went above and beyond to make us feel at home and welcome. The room was beautiful as was the balcony. Breakfast/ bar area was really cool and the spread for breakfast was amazing. Great location as well! The pool was small but just what we needed and had a view of the sagrada familia! I’d rate this place higher than a five if I could ",5,2018,05,31
13,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here 3 nights, sort of a grand finale to a trip that took us from Italy, to Switzerland, then Spain.  Lovely historic building with old world style and first class amenities.  Breakfast was delicious and the restaurant was charming both filled with morning light and after dark for a night cap.  Beds were comfortable, the rooftop pool small but refreshing and the location very central to most sites.  Using points brought this top-shelf experience within our budget!",5,2018,05,30
13,Pros and Cons,"This is a beautiful property and the staff endeavors to exceed expectations, however at the end of the day I didn't love it. The positives are the location and the property itself.  The second floor library, restaurant and concierge area are lovely and comfortable.  The outdoor bar is a wonderful spot for a drink or desert and the staff is great there.  We arrived on St. Jordi day and the hotel had placed a rose in our room which was a great touch.  The cons...the first day we noticed a faint sewage smell in our room and over the next 4 days it increased.  It seemed the air turned off when we were out of the room so the smell built up when the room was unoccupied.  It dissipated pretty quickly after getting back in the room but obviously was unpleasant. In Marriott's defense, we didn't complain so they didn't know about the problem. I also thought the restaurant could use an overhaul -- long wait times for food, an overly fussy menu and overwrought service.  Marriott was advertising the arrival of a celebrity chef so perhaps he will bring clarity to feeding hungry people real food. My opinion was that the experience fell a bit short.  Still a lovely hotel though and a pleasant although not memorable stay.",3,2018,05,30
13,Great hotel in great location,"Hotel was walking distance from most if not all tourist locations. Cost was medium to high, but I used my Marriott points.since they didn't have a lounge for my Marriott level, they offerred Continental Breakfast or extra Marriott Points as a substitute.  I do recommend the hotel.",5,2018,05,29
13,Great location and beautiful property,"This hotel is very conveniently located about half way between Sagrada Familia and La Rambla.  Easy walk for us to either.  The hotel is beautifully appointed and the staff is very accommodating, especially Reyes, one of the lobby attendants.  Our suite was beautifully appointed.  Highly recommend.",5,2018,05,28
13,exceptional stay,"It was a pleasure to spend some days in this full of charme hotel. 
The service was great and the staff was really exceptional. 
A team of young people very motivated and enthusiastic about their job.
always careful to satisfy every customer request and always present but in a discrete way so that to put the customer at ease.
Every time I will be in barcelona I take advantage of the hospitality of this hotel.",5,2018,05,28
13,Maybe byo pillow?,"As an SPG ambassador platinum, I have high expectations. Coupled with the great reviews for this property, I was very excited for our stay. And, while the cotton house delivers on a sleek aesthetic and great location, there were 2 issues that make it tough to give them more than 3 stars. 

1. The pillows were terrible. We are talking polyester with zero support and no hidden feather or more supportive options in the closet. 

2. The service was odd. At the times I didn’t need help, it always felt like there were 3-4 people greeting me. But, when I needed to check out and get to the airport, I waited 15 min because there was only one person working the desk at 9am. Not an odd time for a number of guests to check out.

Platinum recognition (for those this is relevant for): the continental breakfast buffet is awesome. Avocado toast on the daily was delicious. And, the pastries, wow!

The room “upgrade” left something to be desired. I think we got a balcony as our upgrade? We did use it, and enjoyed it, but if it’s not clear that it’s an upgrade, why bill it as such???

Bottom line: This is a beautiful property in a good location and everyone was really nice. Pillows and front desk management should be easy to fix. Don’t let this review turn you off. ",3,2018,05,28
13,Top class hotel.,"This luxury hotel is worth  staying in its properties.It is very well situated  ,walking distance to la Rambla , a multitude of restaurants and tapas bars, 
The service from the front desk to the hotel restaurant /bar is excellent and the rooms are well decorated and charming.",5,2018,05,27
13,"Charming hotel, great location","We loved the Cotton House Hotel. The decor is beautiful, the location is fantastic and the staff was charming. The rooms are well-appointed, but not huge or luxurious.  The bed and linens were lovely. The breakfast is fantastic. The lounge area near the breakfast room, the restaurant itself, and the outdoor seating area are all very charming.  There is a very small lap pool with lounge chairs on the rooftop.  We did enjoy sunning ourselves here for a few hours one afternoon, but for those who want a big poolside experience this is not it.  The exercise room is tiny, which did not matter to us since we walked miles each day touring the city. We are platinum members and stayed using points and cash.  We thought it was expensive in terms of the cash required in addition to points. We did not shop around and have not stayed in Barcelona anywhere else, so don't have a good reference for the quality of stay in regard to the pricing.",5,2018,05,27
13,Grand and beautiful hotel on a great location ,"What a wonderful way to make my holiday perfect ♥️ great location near the Rambla, the gothic district, romantic walk through narrow streets with beautiful houses and great restaurants. 
This hotel is now one of my favourite, great and comfortable beds, beautiful smiling staff. Great breakfast buffet. 
Looking forward visiting again. ",5,2018,05,27
13,Outstanding in all respects,"This hotel has a great location, charming & historical decor, and a marvelous staff.  Our friends had a dental problem on a Saturday the day before we boarded a cruise ship the hotel found an open dental clinic and the problem was solved professionally, quickly and at a reasonable cost in 1 hour.  The Egyptian room is worth the cost as it is larger and in a more quiet part of the hotel.  The view from the pool terrace is wonderful.  The hotel restaurant is good and a great place to have a drink & light meal after touring all day.  We would stay here every time we are in Barcelona.",5,2018,05,26
13,Great stay and better service,My wife and I stayed at the Cotton House in Barcelona before heading north tothe Madrid. It is a wonderful hotel with a very professional and engaging staff. The location is very convenient to the many must see sites in the City and public transportation and quality restaurants are within easy walking distance. The hotel is terrific.,5,2018,05,26
13,Fabulous Hotel and Staff,"I stayed for 3 nights in April of 2018.  The people there were so friendly and helpful, it was a great place to recover from jet lag and see Barcelona.  From the water and apples available in the lobby each morning for walkers/runners/dog walkers to the clean and neat rooms I really enjoyed myself there.  The main areas are full of old world charm but the rooms and bathrooms are thoroughly modern.  I do think the outdoor patio area could use some fresh cushion covers but other than that I have no complaints.  The concierge services were top notch and helped me learn the city.  First class location, too!",5,2018,05,26
13,Wonderful Stay,"Like all the other reviews state, this hotel is amazing. Location is wonderful, staff were friendly and very helpful, the room and common spaces were a delight. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2018,05,24
13,The best of the best.,"I cannot say enough about this hotel. We stayed here for just two nights at the start of our honeymoon, though I could have stayed for weeks. The staff could not have been nicer, our room was absolutely stunning, the bathroom was pristine, and we felt like celebrities the entire time. They just treat every guest this way! The restaurant/bar is gorgeous and breakfast is well worth the extra cost. If I return to Barcelona, I will absolutely insist on staying here again.",5,2018,05,23
13,"Great, well located hotel","This is a very well run hotel. Service in all areas is at a high standard. Dining / bar area is very unique for a small hotel such as this. Be sure to request room looking to interior, not the street, and it will give you a flavor for living in Barcelona. We look forward to returning on our next trip to the city.",5,2018,05,22
13,"Sumptuous hotel, the best in Barcelona!","There’s no better hotel than The Cotton House, Autograph Collection in Barcelona at the moment, a personal favourite of Barcelona-based superstar Shakira.The Marriott’s Autograph Collection is always a guarantee for quality and perfection, but The Cotton House Autograph Collection goes beyond expectations. Very central (it only takes 30 mins by taxi from the airport), the 83-room property saw an intense refurbishment process which culminated in January 2015 with an opening to local and international clientele who can enjoy listed architecture, pastel furniture, and cherry on the cake: a rooftop pool terrace view over the iconic Sagrada Familia. Staff is very professional and dedicated: from welcoming guests upon check-in with a glass of cava to greeting them with their names in the morning, the level of professionalism is unmatched in Barcelona. There are four bedrooms adapted for the disabled and a ramp for the swimming pool.",5,2018,05,21
13,The Very Best in Barcelona for 50th Birthday Celebration,"From both my professional experience as an exec in the travel publishing industry and my personal perspective, absolutely everything about this property and its staff is exemplary of the very best in hospitality. It's what I'd expect from Relais & Chateaux, not Marriott. From the minute we arrived to the minute we departed, we felt completely attended to and graciously welcomed into the property's ""family"" of a clearly proud team. Everyone's professionalism and level of courtesy—from the bellman to the front desk team to each concierge to everyone in the dining room and the entire housekeeping staff—was consistently outstanding. That's a real feat.",5,2018,05,19
13,Disappointing,"I came to stay for a couple of nights-in between work trips in EU.  I am a lifetime platinum member with Marriott-used points to stay.  When I made the reservation I noted that it was 2 non-couple staying.  We arrived a bit early-so the reservation clerk took our number and assured us she would call when the room was ready-well, at 7 pm-no call-figured the room HAD to be ready so we went to hotel.  Yep, it was ready-just no call.  We stayed in room 202.  I opened the door and gasped for air.  There was literally 3""s between the beds and absolutely NO ROOM to move around or even open up suitcases.  I thought I would see at the desk if I had options.

Well, this was Tuesday the 11th of May at 7pm ( for you management to track down this desk clerk as I don't want to call her out in a public forum).  When I told her the room was way too tight-we couldn't even open suitcases-well her responses was ""open them on the bed"".  I asked about changing room-no.  I said I would pay for an upgrade.  Her response ""the hotel is sold out""-then I was rather unceremoniously dismissed.  Yep, over 400 nights spent in a Marriott and I was dismissed.

So we moved out a chair into the hall-and pushed the beds apart to have some breathing room-but it was still horrible (avoid room 202!).  I went on line and checked-and I suspected-there were plenty of rooms available.  Why this desk clerk would lie when I can easily go online (verified also with call to reservation line) and check-who knows.  

So let that sink in-I am a loyal Marriott person-and she can't be bothered-worse yet-flat out lied to me.  So, Cotton House-I am DONE WITH MARRIOTT.  I will be shutting down my Marriott CC and moving away from Marriott.  This stay reminded me of what is wrong with Marriott properties-you just don't care.  I will be sure and tie your name to my closing out my account with Marriott-they can thank you personally for the loss of revenue.  Not accommodating me is one thing-having an employee that lies-not acceptable.  

Don't stay here with points-they don't care.  Lots of options-take this off your list.",2,2018,05,10
13,Beautiful former mid-1800's home of a cotton Baron,"Exquisite hotel with very helpful and friendly staff.  Beautifully renovated and decorated, incorporating themes of cotton and business. Centrally located between the old City and l'eixample, making it easy to walk everywhere. Very near to metro stops as well. ",5,2018,05,10
13,Impeccable 3 night stay!!,"We very much enjoyed our three nights in the luxurious hotel.  The rooms were very nicely decorated and very comfortable!  The staff was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful.  The breakfast was fantastic - some of the best pastries we’ve had in Europe. Nice selection of fruits, meats, breads, etc and menu options for eggs, etc.  the concierge staff was phenomenal with perfect advice and restaurant recommendations!  And the location was perfect - walking distance to most everything!  Highly recommended!!!",5,2018,05,08
13,Great Barcelona Hotel Stay,We have been to Barcelona many times and this was the first time we have stayed at the Cotton House Hotel. The hotel is situated in a great location to all the main interests and good restaurants. The staff was outstanding! Always helpful and wanting to provide the best service and care. The rooms were wonderful - all the comforts needed in order to enjoy a relaxing night! I wish we had more time on our trip to stay more nights. Thank you hotel staff for a very enjoyable stay!,5,2018,05,04
13,WONDERFUL,"Great Location, Very Stylish, Restaurant was really good...but the best part was the front desk staff.  Had a luggage mix-up and they were so kind and helpful.  Highly recommend.  Would definitely choose this Hotel again.",5,2018,05,03
13,Wonderful stay,"This was great property right in the heart of all that we wanted to do in Barcelona.  The rooms was very comfortable and the staff was great.  The concierge recommended some wonderful restaurants.
There was a great bar and outside area as well as a breakfast buffet.
I highly recommend this property!",5,2018,05,01
13,Wonderful boutique property with a great location.,"We spent 5 days here as part of a European trip to celebrate 30+ years of marriage. Everything was excellent and the staff surpassed expectations. The only thing that is maybe a downside for some is the size of the rooms. They are small as are a majority of European hotel rooms .
The restaurant food was very good, but it's Barcelona the options are incredible for all budgets. I would certainly stay here again.  ",5,2018,04,30
13,Great location; great concierge; a few hiccups,"The Cotton House Hotel is a lovely hotel in a historic building in a great walking neighborhood, not far from a Metro station. The concierge service is fabulous.  The buffet breakfast has a huge variety of options.  The rooms are small but comfortable.  We had two issues:  the first was no hot water one day; the second was the restaurant staff was not well trained.  Perhaps because many of them are in hospitality school and doing internships at the hotel.  That being said, I would stay here again.",4,2018,04,27
13,Had a great time! ,"Really really loved this hotel for unexpected reasons. 

The standout was the first floor Bataur restaurant. We had lunch in their outside terrace after arriving which was a great way to settle in on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Breakfast each morning there was a treat. Also had a light dinner there our last night in town before going out for drinks. Seems like it is a hotspot for locals as they were running a reservations list and dressy Spaniards showed up with friends and family. The chicken Caesar salad was so good we ordered it twice.

If you are there on the right days sign up for the free yoga class offered in the morning. The teacher was lovely and we were able to do yoga outside on the terrace. Special treat afterwards is a bottle of water and some fresh fruits. 

The room itself was nice but very quite small. The gym left much to be desired as it is so small I could barely turn around. The pool is also very small but enough to have the pool vibe and chill on the lounge chairs. 

Excellent location with 15min walk to most places you would want to visit. I would stay again!",5,2018,04,25
13,Best places to stay in Barcelona,"This is one of the most beautiful and friendly hotels I have ever stayed. Everything here is just wonderful. The room is spacious and very well equipped. We have a little front garden to our selves. The staff was efficient, friendly and helpful. The flight I took lost my luggage and they helped me to call the airline services (in Spanish) and tracked my luggage down. Every corner of this hotel is just gorgeous and makes you happy to stay and admire. The food in the restaurant is also very good. The location of the hotel was perfect. Very close to city center and has two Metro stations nearby. Highly recommend and would love to stay there again!",5,2018,04,23
13,Excellent Hotel all around,"Me and my girlfriend visited my City of Barcelona and stayed at the Cotton House. This hotel exceeded all my expectations: Location, decor, service, food etc. Never saw a more friendly and efficient staff, with special mention to the two tigers from the Dominican Republic, Edward and Reyes.",5,2018,04,22
13,Beautiful and classy hotel near food and shopping,"My wife and I stayed at the Cottonhouse for a week in April and it was an absolute delight! The hotel staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and are able to provide hundreds of recommendations. 

The hotel bar and restaurant has a beautiful patio that is as fantastic as the drinks and food. I recommend eating breakfast at the hotel before you hit the town. The Cottonhouse is a mere three streets away from hundreds of shops and restaurants.  ",5,2018,04,22
13,Wanted to love this place,"I thought long and hard about how I wanted to write this review.  The entire time we stayed there I was conflicted as we used (very valuable) points for our stay.  I believe that should always be taken into consideration.  My husband and I are life Platinum members of Marriott and have benefitted greatly by that program.  In that respect we liked having a choice of room class at this location vs only have one low class to choose from.   Important to note they don’t, at least when we booked, offer any of the Suites on points.  Not surprising and that was fine.

The rooms are clean and fresh but oh so terribly small.  We had the largest non-suite room with a balcony (which is odd as non-other in this class did) Egyptian room.  I don't remember the room number but it was on the 5th floor on the inside court.  It was at the end of a hall and on a corner which afforded us a small space near the door which to store our luggage.  We had been traveling for some time and had three large suitcases.  We stayed here a week so unpacked by 50% and storage for our luggage was nil.  The bathroom is nice but lacking in ventilation.  The Egyptian room has two sinks which was important to us.  None of the other non-suite rooms did. The products in the bathroom were wonderful.  The air-conditioning in the room was excellent.  Cleaning service excellent.  Bed and pillows were very nice, soft and as one would expect, great cotton products.  

Now here is where we go downhill.  As I mentioned the room is small.  If I was paying the $700 a night for this room, as suggested during the month of our stay, I would have been even more disappointed.  The breakfast was lacking in every way possible.  At first you believe it's grand but start tasting the food and I can't believe they get away with it!  I ordered scrambled eggs one day and I swear they were swimming in ocean water.  The meats were tough and the fruit tasteless.  By day three we were eating churros on the street and only grabbing cappuccinos at the breakfast bar.  Our room had a small loveseat that was a sleeper.  It was falling apart and of terrible quality.  Very hard to sit in and get out as you sank a foot into it.  The desk, coffee table and loveseat/sleeper had, maybe, 10-12 inches between each for your legs.  My husband and I were crawling over each other when getting ready or working on our laptops.  Wifi was limited.  Can’t honestly remember if we paid for it.  

The concierge were wonderful to deal with but didn't come up with anything spectacular.  We are very familiar with dinning in Barcelona and some of the suggestions given us were not top tier (after asking for such).  Everyone was courteous and helpful but suggestions were mid-tier and sometimes leaned towards touristy.  I got the impression they had little direct experience with the locations and were just advised to refer to them.  

Back on the positive side, the location is great and we walked just about everywhere except for long day tours.",3,2018,04,17
13,"Beautiful Old Building, Modern Hotel",We loved this hotel.  Well located within 1/2 mile to one mile from most attractions. Very nice patio for drinks and dinning. Gracious and comfortable sitting areas.  Balcony to sit on.  Very comfortable bed! And it was quiet at night.  Staff was more than helpful.,5,2018,04,17
13,Great location and service,"Boutique hotel with great service and prime location. Rooms were clean, there’s a small fitness center and pool located on the rooftop. Within walking distance of lots of shops, restaurants, and landmarks. Great restaurant with breakfast buffet and bar. Would definitely return! ",5,2018,04,16
13,Nice boutique hotel in the city center,"Elegant hotel with very friendly staff, great location (and super tasty chocolate). Love the design of the hotel. 10min walk to Casa Mila and 15min drive to Park Guelle. Would be perfect if Autograph Collection considers to offer more complimentary upgrade to their favorite reward customers.",5,2018,04,14
13,A fantastic experience with my family.,"My family and me visited Cotton House Hotel for 4 days and the experience cannot be described with words. Simply the hotel was amazing !!! 

The staff is very friendly and professional at its most. Firstly, in the entrance we were offered with a glass of champagne and some sweets, which made us feel like at home. Afterwards, the staff took our bags and delivered it to our room, making our life so much easier!. I really appreciate the concierge team, they helped to make our stay unforgettable, from booking the tickets to sagrada familia, recommending excellent restaurants and even booking tickets to the theme park and the zoo for my little son!

The hotel itself is stunning, the sensation when you walk inside the historical building take you to the past! The library and the restaurant were truly beautifully decorated making my time eating my breakfast and drinking coffee unforgettable! 

The room we stayed was excellent as well, spacious for 3 people with a small terrace , with all kind of amenities we would expect from such a high quality hotel and even more ! The room was as well very nicely decorated and the most important super clean!My favorite part of the room however was the bed, super soft and relaxing made my family and me sleep in an instant !

If you are looking for a different kind of a hotel in a historical building, with excellent staff and walking distance from the city, I highly recommend this one!!!",5,2018,04,10
13,Hidden Gem in Barcelona,"I am staying very regular in Barcelona in many of the nicest hotels. I recently stayed at this hotel (part of the Autograph Collection) and I think that it is one of the best hotels in town. The service is excellent and the rooms, restaurant, terrace are great.",5,2018,04,10
13,What a fantastic hotel from beginning to end!,"We were greeted by the most charming young woman, named Laura, who smiled the entire time she was helping us.  She welcomed us with a glass of champagne and delicious butter cookies. After checking in, we were given a tour of the hotel and an explanation of its history which runs deep and then up to our beautiful room with a view of the city.  The bathroom is the winner for me.  It was quite large with a vanity with two sinks and the shower was larger than our walk-in closet.  The bed was extremely comfortable and there were lots of fluffy pillows.",5,2018,04,09
13,Comfiest Beds Ive Ever Slept On,"Not a bad thing to say about this place. The rooms are a little tight but the beds are like clouds, the staff is perfect, and the margaritas are some of the best I have ever had. If and when we come back to Barcelona, we will without a doubt be staying here again. Thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2018,04,08
13,Superb all around!,"My wife and I stayed here last week for 4 nights and could not have been more impressed.  The facility is top-notch and oozes with charm.  The location is excellent, and the staff were so kind and helpful.  Easily recommended and a place I will absolutely stay the next time I'm in Catalonia.  (side note, very nice welcome as a Platinum member)",5,2018,04,05
13,Luxury at its finest,"This was a spectacular visit to Spain. I went around the beautiful landscapes, as it is easy to travel around if you base yourself at this hotel, but I enjoined this hotel the most. Its exquisite food and bedrooms where absolutely fabulous!",5,2018,04,04
13,Nothing Better,"My wife and I have stayed at some wonderful hotels, both in the US and Europe, and our stay stay at the Cotton House was one of our best.  The place is immaculately beautiful, with old world charm and highlights.  The staff was courteous, very fiendly and prompt with any request - the nighttime front desk staff went out of their way to help us during a late night flight crisis (last minute flight cancellations).

The room itself was comfortable, well appointed, with a amazingly comfortable bed.  After days spent walking, and nights spent eating, it was a nice quiet place to come back to relax for the next days adventures.

The Cotton House is the place we will stay on our trips to Barcelona.",5,2018,04,02
13,The Place to Stay,"This hotel has an old world charm with all of the modern day amenities.  But what sets them apart is their customer service and making the guest feel special through out their stay.  From the time we arrived, each individual we encountered demonstrated the pride and joy they felt working at this property.  Upon arrival we were welcomed with a light refreshing beverage and was provided a detailed quick tour of the facility on our way to our room by the bellman.  Our room was on the first floor adjacent to the restaurant.  As a Platinum Marriott member we received an upgrade to a room that had a private patio area.  The room was very spacious and it greeted us with a personal welcome message on the mirror.  The food and service each day at the restaurant was top notch.  We had breakfast each morning and ate dinner in the hotel one night as well.  By day two, the hostess knew us by name which is always a good sign that the hotel pays attention to the details.  We had the fortunate pleasure of using the concierge team for several ticket needs and they were extremely helpful.  The hotel itself is conveniently located in walking distance to many of Barcelona's attractions.  The Cotton House Hotel is one of the nicest hotel properties I have stayed out.  We will no doubt stay here again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2018,04,01
13,Stylist comfort,"A welcome change from the usual cookie-cutter chain hotels.  The architecture and ambience of this hotel is calm and serene.  

The concierge were fantastic and delivered great suggestions on things to do and restaurants to visit.  They even pulled out all the stops and got us a table at 'Tickets' - a very hot table and very hard to get a reservation.  'Tickets' was fantastic (another review for that).   

The rooms are very clean and, with the high ceilings, very airy.

Afternoon snacks on the terrance hit the spot and don't miss the sangria - very tasty",5,2018,04,01
13,Beauttiful Boutique Hotel with Excellant Staff!,"Wonderful boutique hotel with a stylish blend of old world & modern décor, historical past, stunning terrace, rooftop pool, and a superb restaurant!  The Cotton Room  with a balcony facing the courtyard, was lovely, spacious, quiet, and very comfortable.  The Staff were extremely attentive and made us truly feel like VIPs.  The hotel is perfectly located on a grand boulevard within walking distance to La Rambla, Barri Gotic, and the Gaudi Houses; Casa Batllo & La Pedrera.

(My only wish is that the hotel was more generous with the in-room bottled water and coffee service.  We just had two very small bottles of water and  two coffee pods provided to us daily.  Our request for more was promptly administered.)",5,2018,03,30
13,Vagabond cowboy,"What a great find. 
Wonderful old hotel but modernized with charm. 
Immaculately clean and well appointed. 
Great staff, great location, great breakfast. 
What more can you ask for?
Four night stay went too fast. 
Will stay here again on next trip to Barcelona or I won’t go !!",5,2018,03,30
13,Week in Barcelona,"Awesome hotel...very comfortable. The food was excellent. We qualified for the free buffet breakfast which was a collection of fresh meats, cheeses, cakes, muffins, cereal, toast, jams, fresh fruits...etc....it was plenty to eat. The hotel staff was wonderful. The students working the restaurant and concierge desk were very helpful...they helped plan our whole week. Most of the activities we did were within walking distance. If you are not into walking, then they can arrange a taxi for you. Our room was small, but very clean quiet, and comfortable ..plenty of room for 2 people. We did not spend much time in the room...we were out every day on trips. I would highly recommend the Cotton House and we plan to visit there again sometime.",5,2018,03,28
13,Great Barcelona Lodging,"The Cotton house is a beautiful hotel with a pool deck, gorgeous dining room and bar, and a comfy library and concierge area.  The location is good for Metro and terrific for walking to Las Ramblas, Sagrada Familia and the Gaudi houses. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was terrific.  Each Autograph Hotel has a history and this one was the Cotton Exchange and then an incredible mansion on the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes.",5,2018,03,28
13,Perfect stay!,"Def visiting this hotel again! Beautiful rooms, stores in walking distance, very nice personel. Couldnt ask for a better stay. Also the service was great, even after check out we still felt very welcome to wait in the lobby for our flight!",5,2018,03,26
13,Great Boutique Experience,"From the moment you arrive, the staff at Cotton House makes you feel like a VIP guest. The staff is energetic and eager to please. The amenities are first-class. The rooms are cozy and well laid out, with huge closets and large bathrooms.

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and the hotel had a nice bottle of Cava and sweet treats waiting in our room, along with congratulatory notes. This was indicative of the level of service throughout our stay. Warm and personal care is given to every request and anticipated need.",5,2018,03,25
13,Doesn't get any better than this!,"My stay at the cotton house was absolutely wonderful. First off, the hotel is beautiful. It's so classy (without being old-fashioned) and the interior design is a perfect mix between classic and modern. The old library is a treat, and the terrace is amazing for sunny days. The rooms seemed very new and had everything one needs (including a great view of Barcelona and the Sagrada Familia). Beds were super comfy and bathroom was great. Oh and breakfast out of this world! In addition to this all, the staff was so incredibly friendly and helpful. Always smiling and happy to help, they were ready to assist me with anything I needed: restaurant reservations and recs, tickets for museums, groceries. They even wrapped gifts I bought for my family. All in all, it was the most wonderful stay and definitely one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! Highly recommend it.",5,2018,03,20
13,Great week in Barcelona at the Cotton House Hotel,"Our family spent last week at the Cotton House to visit our son who is studying in Barcelona this Spring semester.  I wanted to compliment the team at the Cotton House Hotel for their excellent service during our stay.  The Cotton House is affiliated with Marriott through their Autograph collection of hotels. My wife & I have stayed in many Marriott properties, including several Ritz Carlton's, and we both felt the service we received last week at the Cotton House was every bit as excellent as any of the Ritz Carlton hotels we have enjoyed.

Specifically, we would like to recognize two individuals who truly made our week in Barcelona special.  First of all, our Concierge Yuriy was extremely helpful in arranging tours, recommending sites and restaurants.  His positive and professional demeanor were so welcoming. Our kids even commented on how helpful it was to have Yoriy helping us make plans throughout the city.

Secondly, we would like to recognize JT, who waited on us before and after dinner in the library.  Again, JT was very friendly and always sincerely interested in how we were enjoying our time in Barcelona.  He often asked what activities we had experienced that day, sharing his perspective and making additional recommendations for the following day.  Our visits in the library turned out to be a great way for us to discuss each day's activities, and JT's excellent service made it even more enjoyable.

Last week was truly one of the best vacations we have ever spent together as a family, and your staff had everything to do with it.  If we are ever in Barcelona again, we will definitely stay at the Cotton House Hotel.",5,2018,03,20
13,Elegant atmosphere!,"This place is absolutely gorgeous! I love the atmosphere, the style and the service. I just tried the bar (really good coffee), but I would say is totally worth a visit. A hidden gem in Barcelona. Highly recommended!",5,2018,03,20
13,Staying here you are in “high cotton !”,"From the friendly, helpful front staff, to the comfortable room with the - of course - 100% cotton linens - we loved this place. We also enjoyed dining in the restaurant, which has a nice ambience. Don’t miss the roof top view of the city! ",5,2018,03,19
13,"Great Location, and everyone was very nice","My wife and I had a great 3 day stay at the Cotton House.   It's on the pricey side, but the room was very nice (but a little quirky).  We received chocolates in our room on two of the nights, we enjoyed wine and cava in their 1st floor ""living room"".
The internet worked well, and there were plenty of outlets in the room.  However, we were a little disappointed it only had one sink, and the shower/tub was in a room to itself.  And one was either in the shower or in the tub.  Not horrible, but a little quirky.

We were a little disappointed with the breakfast.  No ""hot"" options were standard.  Not even eggs.  Hot dishes were five Euros additional.

I would consider staying at the Cotton House again",4,2018,03,13
13,Excellent,"Last week we stayed for four nights at this very special and beautiful hotel in Barcelona.
We were very pleased with the excellent services. The moment we entered the staff did everything to make us feel welcome. Drinks and chocolate while checking in and professional help with luggage and reservations. They even mannaged to get us a reservation in the very much wanted restaurant ""Tickets"", which has a 3-month waiting period. Breakfast was excellent with lost of fresh fruit and excellent sweets too. Fast service with coffee by the very friendly Dominique. The concierge service was more professional, helpful and available than we have ever seen before- and we are frequent travellers. The heads of the team, Alfredo and Damian, both have the very exclusive Clé d'Or and we understand why. We never had to wait for help and the restaurant reservations were perfect. We will definitely return to this stylish hotel, with very nice soft jazz music and it's very well dressed staff that helps you to relax before you visit the city. The terrace and roofpool gave us the opportunity to enjoy our drinks and food in the sun.",5,2018,03,08
13,"Cute, Elegant hotel. Great location!","Beautiful hotel! Wish we had enough time to tour the hotel. Staff was very friendly and addressed us by our names. The downside? The rooms are VERY small! My husband and I had two big bags and two handbags which made the room very crowded and hard to get around. 

Also, the day we got there I headed into the shower. Once I got in I realized there were a few pieces of small hairs on the shower wall.... They weren't mine. There was more than one. Makes me wonder if the house cleaning cleaned the bathroom or not before we got there. I then noticed the floor of the bathroom also had some hairs. I had some disinfective wipes and spray, so decided to clean a little on my own. 

On our 2nd morning, the house keeper just opened the door and walked in while we were inside without knocking. 

Aside from those two things, the room was great and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The location was perfect! I would definitely stay here again, maybe just inspect the room before hand and report to guest services when there is a problem immediately.",3,2018,03,08
13,Elegant!,"Charming hotel - beautiful décor and architecture. Interesting stairway in the hotel.  Staff were incredibly pleasant - gave us a tour of the hotel, the history of the hotel and were charming.  Lovely, comfortable lounge on the first floor.  The restaurant is beautiful and the breakfast was lovely.   Great location - a couple of blocks from the buzz of the city centre. Proximity - about a mile from Sagrada Familia too which we walked to.  Highly recommended.  The only negative was the swimming pool was closed.",5,2018,03,06
13,a hidden gem,"You have to know it. Even some of the taxi drivers haven't heard of this hotel. But that's exactly the charm and it should stay like that. Located in a former mansion, later converted into a cotton exchange, it still is a mansion, with original inlaid wooden floors, beautiful painted ceilings and it feels more like a house than a hotel. The lounge is intimate and beautifully decorated with lots of cubist paintings. The dining room and bar are charming and have a great view on the garden terrace. The rooms are not large, but especially on the south side (away from the Gran Via) all have large enough balconies (and are dead quiet - even with the windows open). The rooms themselves are very well done, all with cotton themes, painted white, which makes them feel roomy and very clean and well maintained. The location couldn't be better, smack in the middle of everything. The service is excellent, with each and everyone of the personel extremely helpful and friendly. One of the concierges, Ido, was especially graceful and was able to get us a reservation in 'Tickets' even though that usually takes several months waiting (which by the way is one of the best restaurants in the world for a reason and worth a journey as they say!). All in all an exquisite gem and it will certainly be my home the next time when  I'm in Barcelona.",5,2018,03,05
13,Charming and Excellent Hotel,"I would highly recommend and plan to stay here on my next visit. The staff were kind and helpful.  The décor was exquisite. And the room was comfortable and lux.  I had a great shower, room service and lovely breakfast.",5,2018,03,04
13,"Great hotel, even better staff","The hotel was wonderful, clean rooms, and lovely architecture. The beauty of the hotel was made even more pleasing by the excellent staff. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted warmly by the front desk staff, and bellman.The concierge staff is wonderful with great suggestions for sightseeing and dining. Great location and a trip made memorable.",5,2018,03,04
13,Beautiful Hotel,We booked 2 rooms using points and got double upgraded. The rooms aren’t big but they are beautifully decorated and the shower was best I’ve had in Europe! The whole hotel is gorgeous from top to bottom. It’s in a really great location. Our rooms faced the back and were extremely quiet. The staff is lovely. The breakfast is very nice. The lounge is very comfortable. Highly recommended!,5,2018,02,27
13,Beautiful Hotel  in a great location!!,"The location of this hotel is away from the main tourist area but close enough to get to easily.   I really enjoy staying here.  This is the second time in less that a year.  The people who work here are very friendly and make your stay very memorable,.  Next time I am to Barcelona, this is the place I am staying.",5,2018,02,26
13,"Clean, Comfortable, Comely ","The impressive building is packed with character, both in architecture and personnel.  On arrival I was greeted by the doorman, offered refreshments while I waited to check in and given a personal tour of both the hotel, and my room. The room amenities were first class, the terry was large and smelled fresh and the linens were crisp. Everyone at the hotel accommodated me and made my Stay fantastic. The food at the hotel restaurant was delicious and the atmosphere was great. The location of the hotel was central which made my short stay productive. I would like to return to this property.

13,Christmas Splendour,"I came to Barcelona and stayed in the Cotton House for a long week-end.  It was a promise I made myself after visiting it FR dinner and drinks previously.  It didn’t fail to completely impress me from the minute I arrived.  In the spirit of Christmas we were welcomed by the warm staff with champagne and Christmas cake and cookies.  The hotel has an amazing Christmas branch decoration which made for great photos.  The whole ambiance of this hotel is warm, comforting and luxurious and we ended stopping for drinks in the bar on our way in and out every evening.  Breakfast is lovely, not a large selection, but delicious, dinner was amazing, and of course the cocktails and wines.  We had been upgraded to a suite which though small was made up by the elegant decor.  I loved it!!!!  Most hotels in European cities have small bedrooms so the size wasn’t a surprise.  As this was an old cotton house I’m sure the original architect wasn’t considering the future comfort of holiday makers, and so the modification to the building is extremely elegant and beautifully decorated.  It is unusual in it’s  layout and lounge areas in that it’s different to any other I have experienced and give you the feel of living in times gone past.  The attention to detail such as the Christmas decorated cookies, and sweet in the library area is a lovely treat.  The bar is delightful as is the garden area out the back.  I can’t say much more to emphasize my delight and happiness in this hotel.  Oh, it’s a great location.  I always stay in this area when I visit Barcelona. No complaints.  Love it! Xxx",5,2018,02,16
13,You can put lipstick on a pig.....,"My wife is a Marriott Platinum member and we stayed in Autograph Hotels in Madrid, Granada and Seville.  All were superior to this hotel.  As a Platinum member we received a “double upgrade” for our room.  I hate to think what we would have gotten without the double upgrade.  Our “upgraded room” was tiny, not small, tiny.  Service was fine and everyone smiled but that didn’t make the room any larger.  I’m at a loss as to why the reviews are so favorable for this hotel.",3,2018,02,15
13,Great venue to experience Barcelona!,"Have stayed in the more pricey hotels down by the Sea, but found this establishment to be more ideally placed. The staff were very attentive both in the house and the restaurant/bar. The breakfast was truly Continental and superb. Rooms were not spacious but well designed with wonderful bathroom facilities.",5,2018,02,07
13,Outstanding. Period.,"My summary: I've stayed in more opulent and 'fancy/grand' hotels. However, I've never stayed in a better hotel. Period.

The hotel is wonderful and the staff are exceptional. If we go back to Barcelona, I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else.",5,2018,02,06
13,Perfect Barcelona weekend ,"Enjoyable stay in a well located hotel. 
Quiet time of year ensured excellent service.

Rooms we very clean with comfortable bedding and linen. 

Looking forward to a return visit during the Summer months. ",5,2018,02,05
13,Excellent quality and real history,"Stayed for 5 nights, best hotel experience in Barcelona, staff equals service.
Ask for a room away from the street. Central location just where to be when leaving outside the front door.
You cannot which for better place",5,2018,02,05
13,A Special Place in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Cotton House over New Years 2018 for 6 nights in a Cotton Room. From the moment we arrived, we were just amazed by the beautiful details that led to a wonderful experience. Upon arrival, you are in one of several lobby spaces that has beautiful furniture and a wonderful scent. We arrived before the official check-in and the front desk took our bags and we went out to enjoy Barcelona. The city was very busy while we there and it was nice to be close to everything but not in the midst of the bustle of Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya. When we arrived back at the hotel we were given our keys to a Cotton Room on the 3rd floor and told our bags had been delivered to our room. The room has a great terrace that faces an inner courtyard and the hotel's outdoor bar/terrace. The room itself was very comfortable with nice intimate touches like great towels/robes that are made in BCN. There is not a lot of closet space but that is typical for a European hotel room. We managed to unpack and organize ourselves in a manner allowed us to hide our luggage. The bed was super comfy and I liked that the bathroom had a rain shower option and a tub. We were never bothered by noise coming from other rooms and housekeeping was included nightly turndown service.  And wifi was great, I was even able to stream Netflix. Going to breakfast at the hotel every morning was such a treat. The attention to detail makes you feel like you are in a very special place and the waiters always greeted you with a smile. We enjoyed the buffet's various options and wonderful cappuccino's every morning.  The hotel's bar/terrace is beautiful and a wonderful place to lounge for cocktails in the afternoon or early evening. Even in winter its warm enough to hang out and enjoy BCN""s sunny weather. It is a bit pricey for drinks and food but a nice treat. The only slight negative is that the gym truly is pretty much unusable with more than 1-2 people in the room. We were able to go to a large gym down the street from the hotel for less than $10 EUR a day but it would have been nice to have a larger space for the gym. On a final note, the pool/rooftop is pretty amazing with great views of the Sagrada Familia and Barcelona. It was too cold to use the pool but I could only imagine that it would be a great place to enjoy a nice dip in the summer.",5,2018,02,03
13,High class service ,This hotel is located Down town and has it all. Great rooms with balcony. The service at the hotel is Great and the history makes you Think back in time. Bar end terrasse is nice. The staff is making your stay Great.,5,2018,02,01
13,Nice Boutique Hotel in Heart of Barcelona,"I selected this hotel for a solo, one night stay off of American Express Fine Hotels.  The hotel had a great location near the heart of the city, close to most tourist areas.  The front end staff was very friendly and check-in was quick and efficient.  I was ""upgraded"" to a room but not sure what made it an upgrade.  The room was small, but not atypical for European cities.  Everything was clean and in good shape.

The room had a seperate shower room which was interesting, but not problematic.  Overall, the hotel was nice.  I would not consider it a family hotel, but for solo travelers  or couples, I would recommend it. 

I have no major complaints other than them calling the room after 9:00 to ask me if I wanted turn-down service, which woke me from a dead sleep.  I get that in Barcelona, people stay up later, but I was in town for a night and was not looking to change my internal clock.  Not a major complaint, but worth noting. 

The reason I am giving it 4 versus 5 stars is that I do not think the hotel comes close to stacking up with other American Express Fine Hotels that I have experienced.  It was a notch or two below in terms of quality.  However, it was a good stay.",4,2018,01,31
13,Truly a 5 star hotel,One of the most amazing hotels I've stayed.  The service was just spectacular.  They went beyond and above to please their guests.  One of the prettiest staircases I've ever seen.  Prettiest restaurant and prettiest bar tenders.  Loved the outdoor lounging area in the back of the restaurant.  They make pretty good cocktails as well. You must stay here and experience it yourself. I didn't want to leave.,5,2018,01,23
13,"Good location, questionable service","Arriving in Barcelona on the day of their independence referendum was exciting; waiting all day for a room was not.  We arrived quite early at the Cotton House Hotel and had them store our luggage.  Naturally, they said that our room was not ready.  Fine, we sat in the library and had some of their excellent (but pricey) iced tea.  After a while we walked to La Sagrada Familia to see the amazing exterior.  (You have to buy tickets in advance to get inside).  After seeing that and walking around, we returned to the hotel.  When we returned, I asked if our room was ready.  They said not yet but that our room was ""being cleaned"".  While we waited in the library again, I overheard two couples who had arrived recently and whose rooms were ready.  Therefore, I went to the front desk again and inquired whether our room was ready.  No, it was not.  At that point I was irked and pointed out that people who just arrived had already gotten their rooms.  On the other hand, we had waited 6 hours and still had no room.  Finally, they got the ""manager"" (turns out he was the bar and restaurant manager) who took us to our ""premium"" room.  It was OK, but not what we were supposed to receive, especially after waiting almost all day for a room.  The manager said that he would give us a suite if he had any available, but he said that there none left.  After he departed, we examined the room further.  It was nice, but again but was not what we were promised, especially since we paid another 90,000 points on top of the original 120,000 points to book the room for 3 days.  Therefore, I returned to the front desk and told them that the room was not acceptable because it was not what we were supposed to get.  (We were supposed to get a premium corner room. The room was not in a corner and did not seem premium.)  The manager reappeared and then took us to the ""Suite Otoman"" just around the corner from the dining room on the second floor (or the first floor, as they call it).  The suite was huge but probably seldom used.  The ceiling was from the 19th Century.  (See picture below).  The room was stocked with soft drinks and liquor.  The hotel never charged us for what we drank, probably because of the shoddy treatment we received the first day.  The hotel has some beautiful features.  The location is good; we watched two independence marches from the balcony of our suite.  The food was good, and the servers was very friendly.  The breakfast buffet was included at no extra charge.  We ate at the restaurant all 3 nights because we were tired.  The menu was not extensive but still good.  There is a pool on the roof, and there was a nice view out over the city.  You can even see the top of La Sagrada Familia.  As long as you don't have the fiasco we did regarding getting the appropriate room, you will enjoy this hotel.",3,2018,01,23
13,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed for 3 nights on a short trip. We have stayed at a lot of Autograph Collection hotels across Europe, USA, and Asia and this was by far my favorite! The hotel had so much charm and character. Very photogenic hotel. We enjoyed the restaurant and the view from the roof top. The room was decent size and the bed was really comfortable. The room was very updated and clean. Location was waking distance to public transportation and easy was to Casa Batllo. Our luggage got delayed from our flight and the front desk went out of their way to keep in touch with airline to get us our bags. Highly recommend this Hotel! ",5,2018,01,22
13,Charming Hotel,I just returned from a trip to Spain and picked the Cotton House for my stay in Barcelona. It was a wonderful experience - from check in to check out.   The room was a large king with balcony overlooking the outdoor restaurant.   Large shower with separate tub and W.C. closet.   Plenty of outlets for charging and enough lighting to work.   The breakfast has everything you would want from wonderful cheeses to fruits and yogurt.   Concierge was extremely helpful with dinner reservations and recommendations.   Trust them and ask them where they would go for dinner.  We had drinks at the bar a couple of times and they offer the usually plus some interesting cocktails.  Try the Spritz with Aperol.  The Cotton House also offers champagne and chocolate to late night arrivals but if you ask they will offer you some too.   While it was too cold to swim the outdoor pool and deck looked like it would be fun in warmer weather.   See photos on instagram #jennmarsland,5,2018,01,18

13,"Cotton House Hotel, Barcelona","My wife and I are veteran travelers and appreciate a high quality of service and attention when we're staying in a hotel, but the staff at the Cotton House was exceptional.  From the moment we arrived at registration, we received an extremely friendly, professional reception.  The staff was very attentive, and we stayed at the Cotton House for six nights, so we got to know some of them quite well.  Our room was very comfortable (with the exception of the convertible sofa) with a small, quiet veranda overlooking a courtyard and the hotel's lovely terrace.  Special kudos to Nuri and Alex in the restaurant for making our stay so pleasant and for their attention to detail.  We give the Cotton House very high marks.",5,2018,01,15
13,Simply perfect!,"I just spend a weekend in this Hotel, it was my second time here whereas it was my girlfriend's first. It was also her first time in Barcelona, and since we wanted to celebrate her birthday I wanted her to experience the best. The Cotton House was my first and only choice. The communication with the staff was excellent, and their Department called ""Gossypium"" helped me with the arrangement of what ended up being an incredible moment for both me and my girlfriend. Once we stepped in she found a big, beautiful bunch of fresh flowers, a note with a personal message from me (they wrote it on my behalf, according to what I wanted to write) a bottle of wine and a little plate with sweets (macarons and so on). Saying that she loved it all is not enough!
Besides this, my room (Egyptian) was awesome, spacious, clean, with that wonderful scent that is a mark of this Hotel. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, the bathroom was beautiful with a huge shower. View on the Gran Vía de les Corts Catalanes. 
The staff is just great. Always willing to help, smiling and kind. Javier, Damian of the Gossypium, Albert, Mario and Gavin were fantastic and they deserve to be mentioned! 
Every time I'll hit Barcelona, this Hotel will be my one and only choice.",5,2018,01,15
13,Amazing hotel,"As frequent travelers, we are used to stay in big hotels but this time in Barcelona, we decided to select a boutique hotel. The Cotton House Hotel has a lot of charm due to the combination of the beauty and the history of the building. 

The hotel is very cozy and the staff really makes you feel like if you were invited by your family! 
The service is warm yet very professional, and the team is completely dedicated to provide you with the best experience possible. 

The view from the top floor to the Sagrada Familia is great and the hotel is perfectly located for tourists, as main attractions and monuments are just walking distance. 

The breakfast is amazing and if you really want to have a resting night, you will not be disappointed with the super comfortable beds!!! 

Thank you Cotton House for this incredible stay, that we are not ready to forget! See you soon!",5,2018,01,15
13,Six great nights at the Cotton House,"We stayed at the Cotton House for six nights on Marriott points.  We spent one night, left our luggage, went to Montserrat with minimal luggage, spent a night there and then came back to Barcelona for five nights. We had asked for a quiet room and got one overlooking the internal courtyard.  It was exactly what we wanted.  The staff was helpful in storing our luggage when we arrived because our room wasn't ready and then storing it overnight when we went to Montserrat.  Breakfast was great and the concierge was very helpful.  Overall, just a wonderful stay.",5,2018,01,07
13,Great boutique hotel in central Barcelona,"Really loved this hotel.  The converted historical building is great, and they are very proud of it, rightfully so.  The rooftop bar is a great place to get a drink, with nice views.  The location is great; not very close to the beach, but walking distance to La Rambla, the Gothic Quarter and the zoo.  Just far enough away to be peaceful.  Concierges were very helpful.  Rooms were nice sized and very comfortable.",5,2018,01,07
13,Wonderful Hotel!!!,"Stayed here for romantic weekend, the hotel is very cool, in a former textile merchant's residence, they've designed the hotel in a very understated, yet elegant fashion. It looks very colonial and oldworldly, but with all modern amenities.
Excellent service throughout, from check in to restaurant and bar. Loved it and didn't want to leave!!",5,2018,01,03
13,"Beautiful hotel with unique decoration, history and central Barcelona location!","My husband and I started our vacation in Barcelona staying at this hotel and it really set the bar high! 

We were greeted by friendly staff and given a class of Cava ( local equivalent to champagne) which was great after a long journey! The hotel itself is beautifully decorated with cotton!! The rooftop is beautiful with great city views! 

The second floor includes the breakfast area, the bar and a library which is a great place to grab a drink and relax with family and friends! 

On top of the great accommodations of the hotel, the location is perfect for exploring the city by foot! 

If you are looking for a unique hotel with interesting history and a central location, this is where you need to stay!",5,2018,01,02
13,A characterful boutique hotel in central Barcelona ,"Cotton House is a superb refuge in the busy tourist city of Barcelona. Service was obliging throughout. The hotel is I believe an old guildhall which gives it a superb 19th century feel - a library, wonderful parquet floors etc. The restaurant benefits from a large outdoor terrace - still quite frequented even in December - which gives one the option of an al fresco breakfast or lunch. One minor criticism was that the public spaces felt a little overheated for my taste - but then the locals sport parkas and furs in the 17C depths of ‘winter’ here! Rooms are light and bright with good comfy beds and a fine shower in mine. This is a great choice in beautiful Barcelona. ",5,2018,01,02
13,"Beautiful public areas, fresh cotton & great breakfast","I usually love the Autograph properties and this was no exception. The building is historic and maintained well so it has ton of character but doesn't feel as if it's in disrepair. The hotel is pretty centrally located so it made it easy to get to and take pit stops throughout the day.

I used my points and got a double upgrade to a room with a balcony, which overlooked the back patio area. This reminds me that I must have a balcony at my next apartment.

The staff are all pretty friendly and the room is great. Everything you need (except a jar of olives) is here, from the Nespresso machine to a bunch of liquor bottles. The bed is comfortable with linens  that are super soft. The coolest feature is the tv integrated to the mirror hanging above the desk. I wish there was a full length mirror. 

There are robes and slippers. I was sort of hoping for lush towels and robes with it being the Cotton House hotel and all. They were fine but not anything to write home about. The shower was great. Storage space was also great. I loved the balcony - did I mention that?

The restaurant is great - well decorated, well stocked and well serviced. I would recommend breakfast over points here. It's a good way to start the day.  

The public areas - opposite side of restaurant, lobby, etc. are all beautiful. Be sure to check out the spiral staircase.",4,2018,01,02
13,#Unforgettable experience,"We had stayed for 1 night and they greeted us with smiles every time, asked about our day and stay, wished us well, helped with doors and bags... couldn't have asked for more! I would personally thanks, Gossypium team for making our stay amazing by surprising us with the amenities and also special thanks to (Alfredo Martínez) and (Damian Castell). We couldn't be more pleased. 

Thank you for an unforgettable experience.",5,2017,12,28
13,An Exceptional Property!,"The Cotton House is a relatively new hotel but has a great deal of historical charm. The property is a remodeled old tailoring house that has incorporated many antique relics of the structures past life into the hotel spaces.

The rooms are airy clean, contemporary, and very comfortable. The bathrooms have a spa feel to them.

There are many lounge areas and my favorite was a library where one can have an afternoon or after dinne cocktail - very relaxing. Even if one isn't staying at the hotel, drinks in the library is a nice way to decompress.

The hotel is located on a prime main st. in an upscale neighborhood of Barcelona. High end shops and cafes run all along the st. so one can feel the lively city energy immediately upon exiting the hotel. 

My stay at the Cotton House was among the highlights of my Barcelona trip and I highly recommend it to anyone I know traveling to Barcelona. ",5,2017,12,27
13,"Cannot wait to be back... again, and again...","Fantastic Hotel!
My favorite in Barcelona!
It is my second stay and again we have been pampered every day by the staff who is available for any requests...nothing is too difficult for them!
The bar is beautiful and the barman makes amazing gintonics...
The room beautiful and specious, the bed very good, everything is just so comfortable...
I really hope to be back again soon, maybe in May for my birthday!",5,2017,12,27
13,Outstanding gorgeous hotel,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.  We loved the room and the balcony.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful, classic and the decor was gorgeous.  The  continental breakfast was fabulous. The outdoor area was great to sit outside with a heater and have drinks. Front desk staff great.  There was a young man working at the front desk one night who was very helpful and friendly.  Staff were extremely professional and service was great.  We loved the location and walked to everything. I cannot say enough about the concierge staff.  Sabrina was absolutely wonderful.  My boyfriend left his prescription expensive sunglasses on a day trip to Segovia and she went out of her way to contact the restaurant, speak to the staff numerous times and set up for them to mail the sunglasses to the hotel.  It was just wonderful.  She was fantastic.  When I return to Barcelona, I would have to say that I would only staff at the Cotton House.  Why mess with perfection!!  Thank you to all!!",5,2017,12,26
13,Beautiful hotel but terrible room,"Very impressed with this boutique hotel. The staff were friendly and very helpful. It’s located in a great location giving you the opportunity to walk anywhere and we did.
Everything about this hotel is beautiful except our room. Our room was small with absolutely no charm. There was no room for your baggage, only one chair to sit on and if you wanted to sit anywhere you had to sit on the bed, which I hare. However the bathroom was tolerable with a large shower and it also had the only closet which was small. Your view was 3 walls. Fantastic!!!! The floors were hardwood and someone above us was walking around in high heels at 2 in the morning. So I paid with our Mariott points and I should not complain. Wrong!! With the number of points that I used we should have gotten a better room. Did not use their facilities because there are so many fantastic restaurants and cafes within walking distance.",4,2017,12,24
13,Definitely recommend this hotel,We stayed in this hotel for three nights during Thanksgiving week.  I would say that the size of hotel was not big but we got lots of personal attention.  Not everyone spoke perfect English but enough to communicate and the staff was all friendly end helpful.  We had a king size bed and a sofa bed for our child in the room.  I can’t say that our room was spacious but we have traveled in Europe many times to know it was a good size room.  The room was kept clean and was nice interior.  The hotel was located in the very convenient spot in the city and was close to subway stations.  We took subways to get to anywhere.  We also walked a lot while we stayed in Barcelona and it was nice exercise.  It was our first trip to Barcelona and did innately our stay at this hotel made our stay smooth and comfortable. We will definitely recommend this hotel for anyone!,5,2017,12,22
13,Gorgeous hotel with friendly staff,"I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and absolutely adored it. The decor is gorgeous, especially the beautiful restaurant. The breakfast every morning was delicious with a large array of cold items to choose from and hot items for only 5 euro extra. We mostly stuck to the buffet but I splurged on an omelette one morning and it was excellent. 

I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offer free fitness classes several times a week, and I took advantage of a yoga class with a friendly, talented teacher.

Our room was extremely comfortable, with a nice balcony. I was traveling with a friend and am a gold Marriott member. The front desk staff were very kind and accommodating in moving us to a bigger room with two separate beds instead of the King I originally booked. 

The real highlight of the hotel is the staff. Every single person we encountered was friendly, helpful, and seemed to genuinely care that we had a good experience. I was on my own my first and last night of the stay and they took special care to make sure I knew where I was going and that I was comfortable. We always felt well looked after and welcome. I will definitely be back to Barcelona, and wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. ",5,2017,12,14
13,"An Outstanding Stay at the Cotton House Hotel, AC","My wife and I are long time Platinum level members of the Marriott family and go out of our way to stay at a Marriott when at home in the USA or at our home in Germany from which we travel throughout Europe. The Cotton House hotel was an absolute joy to be staying at while visiting Barcelona. A beautifully decorated hotel with a fascinating history to be shared. The rooms, restaurant, library and overall ambiance were exceptional. Most impressive was the staff. From the reception desk, to the restaurant staff to the concierge.  All were friendly, professional and welcoming.. We were treated like family and made to feel as such. Truly an outstanding group of professionals and each a wonderful ambassador for the Marriott. If visiting Barcelona in the future, we would not choose any other hotel than the Cotton House Hotel.",5,2017,12,08
13,The only place for me in Barcelona.,"From the moment I crossed the threshold of the doorway at Cotton House I was treated with exceptional care.  The front desk staff is very helpful and professional.  They provide a great deal of information about the hotel history and offer a personal tour once you are settled in your room.  The rooms are all lovely, but I was fortunate to get an upgrade to the one of the individualized suites.  The was a mix of historic home architecture with the modern appointments you expect in a luxury hotel.  The first floor offers many sitting areas to relax outside of your room including a stunning library and atelier room.  You can get lost in all the historical aspects, it is simply breathtaking. The main restaurant and bar are also located on this floor and the food is exceptional, as is the service.  There is a lively bar scene as well, but you can also have a more quite moment in one of the side rooms near the library where they will serve drinks and snacks.  The breakfast offerings in the main dining room are nearly overwhelming. The service in the dining room in exceptional.  If you are there in warmer months, you can enjoy dining outdoor on the terrace.  They also offer a pool and spa area on the top floor of the old mansion with a lovely city view, but this is truly a summer activity.  The front desk is also very informative with information on transit and services if you plan to do any tourist activities.  The location is in the heart of city with easy access to anything you would like to do in Barcelona.",5,2017,12,05
13,Best hotel in Barcelona I have stayed so far,"What a lovely place! Everything fits together so well. From the decor, the interior design up to the chic uniforms of the entire staff. Historic elements combined with modern design, I loved everything about it. 
Cosy rooms and wonderful beds.
And most importantly, the entire team is so friendly and attentive and hospitable. Always smiling.
I will be back!",5,2017,12,05
13,wonderful and memorable experience!,"I had not been to Barcelona in many years and had asked for a recommendation and was directed to Cotton House. After staying there for 4 nights I have found a new favorite hotel. 
I was lucky enough to be upgraded to the Ottoman Suite. The decor of the suite and all public areas is simply stunning. The attention to detail is astounding. 
My room was on the first floor and facing the main street outside. However, double glazing allowed me to have a perfectly silent room at night. 
The staff was incredible and on many occasion suprised me by calling me by name. 
The breakfast was a fantastic start to my day. The breakfast buffet was well arranged and the overall atmosphere was always very positive. 
I cannot wait to come back to Barcelona, and of course, stay at Cotton House again.",5,2017,12,03
13,Best kept secret in Barcelona,"Our staying in this hotel was absolutely marvelous. We were staying in this beautiful room and it couldn't had been any better. We had a beautiful balcony with the best view over Barcelona. Besides that we had a bathtub and rose leaves everywhere, very romantic. They thought about every detail and the hotel has an extremely luxury and classy atmosphere, but because the staf is so nice it feels really cosy as well. They made sure we had everything we needed and WOW the breakfast had everything you wished for; all kinds of food of the best quality in a beautiful restaurant. I was especially  impressed by the Gossypium team and their knowledge about the city and their good recommendations. We will definitely come back to the Cotton House next time we're in Barcelona. This hotel is probably the best kept secret you will find in Barcelona.",5,2017,12,03
13,WONDERFUL HOTEL in a GREAT LOCATION,"My daughter and I ended our two week vacation in Europe by staying at the Cotton House.  We found this hotel to be elegant and welcoming thanks to the attentiveness of all the staff we encountered.  Gaby offered us a glass of cava as we checked in.  Our room on the 6th floor had a balcony overlooking the terrace.  We awoke every morning to a spectacular sunrise with the ocean in the distance.  Our room was nicely appointed with every amenity needed to make for a comfortable stay.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning. Edward, our waiter, remembered our beverage preferences!  We needed to order a ""take away"" breakfast one morning.  We were not disappointed.  James in concierge arranged several tours to suit our interests.  As tourists, the location allowed us to safely walk both day and evenings.  We want to extend a sincere thank you to all the staff for making our first stay in Barcelona a memorable one.  We highly recommend this Marriott Autograph Hotel because it truly lives up to that standard.",5,2017,12,01
13,Spain Trip ,"Our first trip to Barcelona, we had the pleasure of staying at this hotel. From the minute we walked in the door, everyone greeted us with a smile and offered help in anyway. Our room was fantastic, a balcony to sit outside and drink wine and a view of the city. Hotel was very quiet and the food was excellent at the restaurant. Hotel staff gave us pointers of things to see and do. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay here!!",5,2017,11,28
13,"Best linens ever in well located, luxurious hotel.","We stayed 2 nights here using Marriott points in room 607. Paid 100 € extra per night to upgrade 2 room levels from a Panama room to a Cotton room. Very glad we did as the Cotton room felt quite cramped. This room has a terrace with a view of the inner courtyard for the entire block so saw backs of many apartments surrounding the courtyard.

The facilities in the room were very nice and comfortable. Probably the best towels and sheets we've ever had at a hotel. I guess they should be with a name like Cotton House....  The entryway of the room opens into a short hall with a closet that contains shelving and a safe on the left as you enter and the toilet, in a small separate room, on the right. After the closet is the sink, with little space for your toiletry kit and another closet with hangers. After the toilet is a unique shower and tub room where the entire floor is basically the floor of the shower. It's really slick when wet so very much appreciated the doorman that brought up our bags showing us where the bath mat was stored under the sink. The shower has a rain forest type head and a hand held option.

The king size bed was among the most comfortable we've ever had. There was little floor space on the 3 sides of the bed not against the wall.  There was a small bench for suitcases that only held one suitcase. I was reluctant to use it since it had a framed painting or print right above it that my suitcase would hit when I opened it. Overall the room was really fairly cramped and would not have enjoyed a smaller room. I suppose that's normal for most European hotels but this was by far the smallest room we had on this trip to Spain.

The staff was very helpful and friendly. We were given glasses of cava on arrival and a tour of the impressive library, L'Atelier room with numerous bolts of fabric and a really cool staircase. This trip was to celebrate a birthday and the Gossypium (concierge) wrote happy birthday on the large mirror in the room entryway and provided a half bottle of wine and a nice piece of chocolate cake. The doorman pointed out that the in room refrigerator could be used to store food or water bottles with no extra charge and also brought us more of the small complimentary water bottles. We used the concierge once to provide us with an excellent recommendation for a nearby restaurant for lunch. Since we are Gold Marriott members we had access to the continental breakfast buffet which was excellent with breads, meats, cheeses, excellent orange juice, fruit, yogurt and a large assortment of pastries and sweets. You could order hot breakfast items for an additional 5 € but felt no need to do so. We asked for and received a late check out since we are Gold members. Glad I reviewed the bill on checkout as they had double charged for the upgrade. That was quickly resolved however I asked for a copy to be emailed to me as the front desk person was flustered by the error and our taxi was waiting with the meter running. Have not received a copy but saw the correct charge on the credit card statement.

The location is right on the division between the old and new parts of Barcelona. We walked 7 blocks to Casa Mila, 4 blocks to Las Ramblas, 5 blocks to the Palace of Catalan Music and the start of Barri Gotic and 2 blocks to Metro stop Tetuan that took only 2 stops to reach Sagrada Familia. All in all an extremely well located location to use as a base for touring Barcelona. Gran Via is a busy street so I imagine the rooms facing it would have some street noise.

Overall I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that likes small luxury hotels especially if you are a Marriott or SPG member.",5,2017,11,28
13,great experience,"We like to compliment the staff of the cottonhouse hotel for there hospitality.They do everything (and more) to make you feel comferable and make you feel at home.
Wonderfull ambiance and delicious food.
The hotel feels warm and cosy as if you come home.
Thank you so much",5,2017,11,27
13,Exquisite hotel!,"The hotel is stunning with beautiful, dramatic staircase. Staff is professional, friendly, and most helpful. The location is perfect. This was our first time staying at the hotel and we definitely will return. 
",5,2017,11,26
13,Pleasant hotel at a great location,"I remember the place to be within walking distance from lots of shopping and good restaurant. It is near the subway station. The hotel is not huge in size and the warm welcome from the hotel staffs made it even more cozy. Almost all of them are very helpful but I can’t help but remember the very smart Gavin Morrison who even speaks mandarin. The front desk ladies have been extremely helpful in giving directions even though the concierge is on the second floor. Overall the stay was pleasant and I would certainly recommend others. Don’t miss the welcoming champagne!
",5,2017,11,26
13,Perfect Spot,"The cotton house is a great hotel well located in Barcelona. The suspended staircase is a great feature and the dining terrace is a great place to relax on a sunny afternoon. The hotel places a lot of attention to detail and the staff are well trained and provide an excellent level of service.
I can only recommend

13,Beautiful hotel!,"We have stayed in Marriotts all over the world, and this hotel was one of our favorites!  It is a gorgeous property.  So many personal touches. When we arrived, they offered us champagne while we checked in.  The room was beautiful and faced the street, however the street noise was almost non-existent.  The concierge recommended an amazing restaurant and made reservations for us, and circled his favorite places to walk to on a map for us to explore.  We had drinks before dinner on the beautiful patio - an oasis in a big city.  It was chilly, and we were offered blankets as well as a fireplace that was wheeled up to our table.  In the morning we had to leave early for the airport, and enjoyed an exquisite continental breakfast in the dining room.  The valets brought our car, and handed me 2 bottles of water as well as a sprig of perfumed cotton as a memoir of the trip.  Wish I could give it 10 stars!",5,2017,11,23
13,Charming and lovely hotel in the center of Barcelona,"In the 19th century this hotel was a cotton factory and three years ago it was renovated into a lovely hotel. The rooms are large, the bed is comfortable, bath products are good. Your door is padded leather. Breakfast is delightful, service with a smile and a great selection. There is a terrace weather permitting. The memories of cotton are in cases around the dining room. Staff is as charming as the hotel is lovely.",5,2017,11,22
13,Perfect,"A perfect stay, it started with me getting out of my cab from the airport and quickly realizing I left my wallet in the cab. The bellman ran 3 blocks to retrieve my wallet!  WOW a great first impression and my next 3 nights continued on the same level! The service on the property is outstanding, more often than not the people working knew my name throughout my stay. 
I had a room on the second floor...I think it was a handicap room as the shower was very large...but maybe every room is like that..the bed was awesome and I had plenty of space to relax and work. 
I had breakfast twice, dinner once and cocktails once...again the service was A plus! 
The location was very convenient as I was a tourist and was able to walk everywhere with ease. I'm a Platinum for Life Marriott guy and this property ranks in my top 5. 
Thanks for a great stay! ",5,2017,11,17
13,Top Tier,This was an absolutely beautiful hotel. The rooms were great with free wifi. They were spacious and comfortable. The hotel lobby was beautiful. The restaurant and nearby lounges were magnificent with unbelievable paintings and ceiling frescoes,5,2017,11,15
13,Disappointing,"We arrived early and understandably our room was not ready.  We were told that they would call us when our room was ready.  No call.  We returned at 4PM and our room was ready but our luggage had not been sent up.  After 30 minutes I went down and got our luggage.  One night at dinner we were given someone else's bill, at first the server insisted it was ours and then blamed it on someone else. Breakfast was average, stale pastries and yogurt with mold.  Our room was the biggest disappointment.  There was not a separate bathroom,  Your enter the room in the vanity area!  Very small room.  Small pool area.  The common areas are beautiful but I would not recommend this hotel.",3,2017,11,12
13,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"I cannot say enough about this absolutely lovely hotel. Our room was on the 5th floor with a balcony that overlooked the outdoor dinning area.  The decor is modern and the room very spacious and very clean. The location is also great. They serve an outstanding breakfast buffet with an array of food that’s sure to please everyone. The staff is also a big part of what makes this hotel a must. They were gracious and couldn’t do enough for you. Don’t hesitate.  James, the concierge is wonderful and will gladly hel you with a tour that will definitely suit your needs",5,2017,11,09
13,Wow! A diamond. A truly great hotel.,"We stayed at the Cotton House the last days of October 2017. It is a great facility! The rooms were very clean, modern and comfortable. We were warmly greeted with a glass of champagne when we walked in the door. Things only got BETTER from that point on! The staff was the best that I have seen in a long while. The food at the hotel beat all of the other restaurants that we tried!! Hands down, no competition, the hotel was the best. Our trip continued on Norwegian cruse lines in a ""Haven"" suite. Private butler, special lounges and restaurants, (the best of the Epic cruise ship), The hotel was better! When I return to Barcelona, there is no question where I will be staying!",5,2017,11,09
13,Business Dinner for 10,"Fabulous hotel in a great location with a very interesting menu. 

We had an excellent dinner for 10, i really enjoyed my visit, everyone was left full and happy.

Great decor and atmosphere, a stunning hotel ",5,2017,11,09
13,You say you want a custom shirt??,"A classic hotel experience in club style elegance, a tourist designation in itself.  Rooms are spacious and well appointed, modern on the inside with a classic feel as you approach and look out the giant balcony windows. Lobby sweets are a don't miss.  Pleasant open air pool on top floor overlooking the fabulous Gran Via.   Elaborate Breakfast buffet with local specialties (omg, those fresh Spanish Figs!!) and comfortable library style sitting rooms in common area.   True to history, one can order in this location a custom fit COTTON shirt from a choice of dozens of fabrics to be delivered during your stay.    Only improvement recommended is complimentary coffee/tea service throughout the day, and SOME amenities for Marriott Platinum Executive Elites.    A memorable stay regardless, true to AUTOGRAPH standards",5,2017,11,08
13,Beautiful Hotel in a Beautiful Town,"The hotel is situated in a beautiful 19th century neoclassical building. We stayed in the Vichy Suite which is a two story suite. The bedroom and sitting room are located on the 5th floor and a lovely internal spiral staircase takes you to the 6th floor where there is another sitting room with a half bath and a private terrace with views of the Segrada Familia. The suite was lovely but I think housekeeping needs some additional training as they placed the clean bed sheets on  top of our suitcases while cleaning the room!
The hotel does serve a hearty buffet breakfast which includes Jamon Iberico - not to be missed.  Location wise it is very central.",4,2017,11,06
13,"Excellent, but not for us",We only visited the hotel to have an evening meal. Lovely hotel but rather too formal for our family - more the atmosphere of a gentlemen's club. We wanted to eat on the outside terrace but they would only serve us starters there and the dining room was too formal a place for our youngsters - we were much more comfortable on the terrace. The food was good but pricey. In the end we made do with a meal of starters. Service was rather slow. Would not go there again.,4,2017,11,04
13,Perfect In Every Way!,"This hotel is a gem. The service is stellar and consistent by every member of the team in each area we encountered. 
There is always someone to greet you and and inquire, if they haven’t already anticipated, about how they can assist you. The front desk staff to the housekeepers, maintenance, bell staff and servers all worked together to ensure a positive experience. That is no small feat and something to be proud of.
James our concierge was extremely helpful  in assisting us which tours would be most appropriate as well as recommending options for a nearby restaurant.
Our room was tastefully decorated and impeccably clean. Bed and bedding extremely comfortable, towels plush. The room had everything you could possibly need. It felt like home.
During evening rounds we requested extra espresso pods and they were delivered in less than a minute.
The dining area was airy and light and there is also an outdoor terrace. The breakfast buffet was extensive and the quality of the food was excellent. 
I hope the trend of the Marriott Autograph Hotels continues, the Cotton House is the perfect model. Thank you for this enjoyable experience while visiting Barcelona.",5,2017,11,03
13,Excellent Hotel,"A group of us stayed here overnight.Everything was first rate.The staff were great,giving us champagne while we waited to check in.Everyone was very attentive and friendly.The food was very good,and they have a nice outdoor space to chill in.",5,2017,11,02
13,Elegant Hotel in Barcelona ,"Stayed here for three nights.  Outstanding and attentive service in historic building.  Perfect for adults seeking a calm oasis in a busy city.  The entire hotel is designed to be a feast for the senses.  Great art work,  pleasing scents, great food and wine.  Breakfast buffet is extraordinary and suits every taste.  Omelets made on request. Located with easy access to Les Ramblas. 
",5,2017,11,02
13,Fantastic - and you get Marriott benefits!,"A beautiful and quiet hotel.  All the staff was very friendly and very helpful.  When we arrived we needed a hardware store to fix a broken suitcase; we told several people in the lobby who tried to think of where to go but Albert remembered there was a hardware store literally around the corner so he walked us in the store and helped translate what we needed - fantastic!  The rooms are quiet, comfortable and very functional - ample outlets and USB ports.  Even though our room was next to the elevator it was very quiet and we never had disturbing noise. All of the front desk and restaurant staff spoke fluent English.  The breakfast is also a highlight - a full buffet of meats, fruits and cereals...for only 5 euro additional you can get a hot egg dish as well.  We were entitled to the buffet as Marriott Platinum but I am not sure what the charge would be otherwise.  We took a taxi a couple of times for some of the further sites but many were located within a 20 to 25 minute walk from the hotel.  There are many choices of restaurants within blocks from the hotel as well.  Definitely recommended for a Barcelona hotel.",5,2017,10,30
13,Fantastic Smaller Hotel in Barcelona,"The Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona is a very unique and wonderful hotel. The staff is fantastic and attended to all of our needs. We stayed at the Cotton House for seven wonderful nights. The house was privately owned at one time and later converted to a boutique hotel with beautifully appointed rooms. We had a room with a balcony which we used during our stay. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was extremely comfortable. The restaurant is great. We had all of our breakfasts there and also two dinners. The restaurant staff made us feel welcomed and were very attentive. If you want a great smaller hotel in Barcelona, the Cotton House should be your home away from home.",5,2017,10,28
13,Stylish 5 star hotel centrally located,"The Cotton House is a very stylish boutique hotel with excellent food and very attentive service.  The rooms are nicely appointed, thought some are on the small side - not untypical of Western Europe.  We spent very little waking time in the room, so not a concern.  The common areas are very comfy and inviting, not something i would say of most hotels.  The food and drink at the buffet breakfast and for lunch was top notch, though not cheap.  Because I have Marriott status, the breakfast was free every day.

The location is excellent, at least for walkers like us.  It sits just north of the old section of town, virtually every key site towards the harbor is 15 minutes walk or less.  Sagrada Familia or Casa Mila is 20 minutes walk north.  The only time we took a cab was for Parc Guell, which would have been a much longer walk.  Decent restaurants nearby, but you will pass multitudes of interesting places on your walks to and from the sites.  The3 location  is very safe and we never felt any concerns on our walks, even at midnight.

I have only two complaints:  
- the “gym” is a joke, 1 bike, 1 elyptical and some dumbbells in a space the size of a walk in closet. And the elyptical broke while i was using it.  I know it’s a boutique hotel, but an establishment of such quality should either have a better fitness facility or not have one at all.  We chose this hotel in part because they advertised a gym, so were disappointed.
- the position of concierge appears to be used as a training opportunity for the generally very young and international staff.  On several occasions our questions to the concierge resulted in a Google search, which i could have done on my own.  They often knew no more about the site, restaurant or journey than we did.

Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay and would consider the hotel again for our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2017,10,28
13,Satisfied,Stayed in the hotel for 3 days prior to a cruise.  Really nice hotel.  Great staff.  Restaurant was very good except that the evening menu was a bit limited.  The breakfast was outstanding.  We stayed in a room with 2 beds.  Highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,10,26
13,Such a wonderful hotel!!!!!,"Great location, we were able to walk everywhere.  Can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel -- the rooms are perfect and quiet, the breakfast buffet is abundant and delectable, the lovely outdoor dining/bar is my favorite place to luxuriate, the decor is elegant and welcoming.  But the very best part is the amazing staff -- from reception to concierge to restaurant staff, every single person is outstanding, kind, helpful and gracious.  Our favorite hotel EVER in Europe!",5,2017,10,25
13,"Beautifully decorated hotel, please put belongings in safe....","We just returned from a 4 night stay at this very beautiful hotel.
The second day there we found that a packet of money from my husbands brief case, which was tucked away in the bottom was stolen.
We informed the manager and they reimbursed us in points for the equivalent money lost. (since we paid in points for the stay) 
We should have used the safe, but never the less felt very violated and scared for the rest of the stay.
Location of the hotel is perfect and the rest of the staff was always very nice.",4,2017,10,24
13,Ok! Four Point five stars ,"I never give more than four stars but this is worthy of better..

After spending 4 busy days on a Mediterranean cruise - we disembarked at 9am and headed straight to our hotel to drop our bags off and get onto the streets for the first of our sightseeing of Barcelona. 

We were greeted immediately at the curb, bags taken to the reception counter.   The young lady that checked us in - was efficient, thorough, and friendly.   Our room wasn’t ready, which was expected being so early.  Our bags were tagged and whisked away to storage before we were half way done with the check in process.  Offered some water and a snack while finishing the check-in.   
The associate informed us if we would be checking out the Sagrada Familia - we would need to reserve a few days in advance.  She directed  us up stairs to the concierge who helped us purchase the tickets, and offered us suggestions for Hop on n Hop Off bus line.  Her recommendations were very useful and helped make our stay a great one. 
Location of the property is great - just on the outskirts enough but not too far. 3 or 4 blocks to La Ramblas. 
The common areas of the hotel were very clean and organized at all times.  
Beautifully & tastefully decorated - the entire ambiance is relaxing, warm and classic.  The theme with decorations & the uniforms are all very cohesive and add to the entire experience. 
The room was immaculate - top to bottom. This room was not the standard European room - instead it had a comfy King Bed and pillows , roomy shower and bathtub combo room and an incredible balcony. 
Our exit was just as efficient as the entrance.   Taxi was ready at 6am and off we went to our next destination... Paris.   This hotel of the four European hotel we stayed in was hands down our favorite! 
 ",4,2017,10,23
13,Cotton experience ,"I probably wouldn't have noticed the entrance of the hotel on this busy boulevard, but once inside I had an experience which was more than a night sleep. I surprise myself saying ""wow"" while I discover the beauty of the hotel. You will be amazed by the right balance of a rich past with contemporary touches but also about the history of the building. The first floor will lead to a beautiful restaurant decorated with lot of taste and a very leafy terrace which adds an exotic touch. Ideal for a cocktail in the afternoon. The only disappointment is when you realise you cannot have your breakfast on the terrace ( frustrating on a sunny morning). You will have choice of various type of food for breakfast international and local to please everyone and every mood ( Tags with allergies or name next to the food will be better ), the service is good but the staff starts feeling the pressure when the room is busy and becomes a bit more nervous but always stay polite. 
The bedroom itself is again well done, I love the indirect lighting that creates a cosy atmosphere. The little balcony/terrace    is facing a typical Courtyard. You will not compromise on the essential as me and my partner slept well, the room is very quiet. The bathroom is very contemporary (not suitable for everyone) but really spacious. The little swimming pool on the top floor  is enough to relax after a long day of sightseeing. The location is ideal for shopping, exploring the touristic areas, but also where the locals live. I definitely recommend the experience, even if the dress code of the guests is a bit too sporty/casual for the style of the hotel (only my feeling during the stay).",5,2017,10,23
13,Best Boutique Marriott,"This hotel is top of the charts in absolutely every area: location, staff – very friendly, very professional and plentiful at all hours of the day or night. The rooms are clean, contemporary & with great bedding, wonderful shower, amenities and well soundproofed. Huge buffet breakfast worth taking. Very nice bar/restaurant & patio courtyard that is very tranquil at the end of a busy day for a drink. Also a very nice rooftop pool.  
I would definitely return here and highly recommend it!
",5,2017,10,22
13,Best Staff at any Marriott Hotel,"My husband and I have been staying at Marriott properties for over 30 years and this is the best. The staff is absolutely wonderful. From the moment that we arrived, we were impressed - - the doorman, the front desk staff, the bellman, the concierges, the housekeeping staff and the breakfast room staff are all top notch.

And, the hotel is lovely. The bedding, towels and mattresses are first class. The breakfast room is bright and the buffet is very good. Also, the location is phenomenal. Easy walking distance to Las Ramblas, El Born, the Cathedral, the Picasso Museum, the port, etc.

We stayed at the Cotton House for four nights at the beginning of our trip to Spain and liked it so much that we stayed there for one night when we returned to Barcelona to catch our plane home.",5,2017,10,19
13,Superb hotel must visit!!!,"This is an amazing property and the location is so beautiful.Rooms are so beautiful ,comfy and spacious.Rooms are inspired by cotton softness.

Breakfast is amazing and have lot of options. Batuar restaurant is elegant with terrace sitting.staffs are so courteous,helpful and understanding.I would highly recommend to stay here when in this beautiful city of Barcelona.",5,2017,10,16
13,Very nice place to stay.,Beautiful hotel.  Very nice breakfast each morning.  The outside patio was an awesome place to relax and enjoy a drink.  The staff here are friendly and accommodating. You will enjoy it here. The rooms are on the small size but very nice.,5,2017,10,15
13,Gorgeous Hotel/Excellent Location/Fantastic Service,"We stayed 4 nights at the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona, and the experience was fantastic. We were able to easily walk to outstanding restaurants in the general area as well as numerous attractions including the Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlo, Las Rambles, etc., etc. The room was tastefully decorated; the bedding was warm, soft, extremely comfortable, and top of the line. Staff members were exceptional in every way. When we arrived we were offered champagne and tiramisu as well as a tour of the beautiful hotel. We felt pampered and extremely valued as guests. The Cotton House Hotel is top of the line in every way.",5,2017,10,14
13,Best Bed Ever!!,"My wife and I stayed here about two weeks ago.  We used Marriott points (45k per night) and we had to pay 140 euro per night so not a terribly affordable hotel.  That said, below are some strengths and opportunities that we experienced...

Strengths...
1. The bed and the sheets are outstanding...one of the best sleeps I have ever had at a hotel. You can actually purchase the sheets!
2. Design, look and history of the hotel is excellent 
3. Central location to many attractions and restaurants (all very manageable walking distance)
4. Very professional and courteous staff 
5. Restaurant was very good...decent variety and options and the quality was excellent

Opportunities
1. While the restaurant was good in terms of food quality, the service was consistently slow
2. They have a pool but it's really a single lane lap pool...not much space around the pool to sunbathe...that said, the views from the top floor are beautiful 
3. Requests made from room to front desk twice required me to call back and check on status (or re-request)

Additional Comments...
We visited during the Catalonia vote for independence and the supporting public strike, none of these events impacted the services or availability of staff at the hotel.  That was very much appreciated as during the strike most every attraction and restaurant was closed.

Overall, great place to stay...highly recommend",4,2017,10,14
13,"Spectacular hotel filled with history, steps away from Plaza Cataluña and Paseo de Gracia","I had looked forward to stay at this hotel for quite some time, and I really loved my visit!

The hotel is located at the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, steps away from the emblematic Plaza Cataluña and near many important sites, surrounded by lots of restaurants, right near the Ramblas and Paseo de Gracia, with its many high fashion stores and outstanding Gaudí houses (Casa Battlo and Casa La Pedrera). 

The building is filled with history: it was called La Casa de la Industria Textil Cotonera, also known as la Casa dels Cotoners, since it was the headquarters of the Cotton Producers Guild. This building was built between 1880 and 1882 by the architect Elies Rogent, who also built the Universitat de Barcelona.

The decision to reuse this landmark for a luxury hotel saved the building from demolition. It was such a wise and wonderful move!! Every detail in this hotel is a pleasure. They preserved the original elements of the building, such as staircases, ceilings, floors and walls, and everything is decorated with cotton details. You feel surrounded by cotton and history.

The bedrooms are perfect, modern, luxurious and comfortable. Our bed was like a cloud, and our window overlooked La Gran Via.

Breakfast was excellent, served in the beautiful settings of Batuar, a restaurant named after a machine that was used for pressing cotton to eliminate its impurities. 

The staff is wonderful, always eager to help and please the guests. At the Cotton House, I really felt transported to another era of elegance and opulence. Altogether, a perfect stay in Barcelona!",5,2017,10,12
13,Avoid - not a 5 star!,"The cotton house hotel put a significant damper on my time in Barcelona. The room was nowhere near 5 star hotel quality - 3 stars at best. We booked using points (45k per night! - for reference you can stay at any park hyatt for 30K points per night and no upgrade fee if you’re a hyatt member). We had to pay a mandatory “upgrade” fee of 40 euros a night, this was not an optional upgrade. I would hate to see what the base room looks like, if it even exists. 

The sink was in the middle of the room and leaked all over the floor and our stuff at all hours. The toilet room had dirt all along the baseboards that wasn’t cleaned the entire length of our stay. The shower was mouldy and had dark brown hair in the drain upon our arrival. There was toilet paper floating in the pool when I went up to check it out. Besides being dirty, the pool was too small to swim in. 

Bottom line: there are tons of hotels in Barcelona at comparable or cheaper price points. This is not a 5 star hotel, don’t waste your money or your points! ",2,2017,10,12
13,Exceeded Expectations - Designers Dream Hotel,This is a beautifully designed hotel in a good location in town. It was an old cotton mill converted and you can still purchase beautiful custom cotton shirts here. The rooms had great working AC - very important when it's hot.  The walk in shower was spacious and there was a separate water closet.  The amenities and bath soaps were top notch and now I ship those products from Italy to America.  We found the accommodations to be very comfortable and enjoyed the delicious breakfast in the mornings.  We walked to many places from here and felt it was fairly quiet.  The staff was friendly and accommodating -  I would love to come back to Barcelona to stay longer and visit - no doubt I would stay again at the Cotton House.,5,2017,10,11
13,First Class Property and Service,"I loved everything about this property! As an event planner, I stay in many hotels around the world and this is, by far, one of my favorite! The service and staff were above and beyond. The restaurant and bar staff, as well as the front desk and concierge, made you feel like you were the most important guest there. The room was beautiful and well laid out. The sheets were AMAZING! I have never slept in a softer bed. I can't say enough great things about the Cotton House Hotel!",5,2017,10,10
13,Comfortable and Good Location,"After 10 days in France we took the train to Barcelona and stayed at this hotel. The attendants at the front desk were friendly and welcoming. One of the young ladies wondered where we had been in France as she was from there. Since we had never been there we relied on the concierge to help us with an “ itinerary”. On both days two different concierges patiently went I’ve a nap with us explaining how we could walk to various parts of the city and what to see and do. The first night we were weary after walking around and around the city. We had trouble getting our bearings and following the map. We decided to try the hotel’s restaurant. We liked it. Being American we ate on the early side, around 7:30. We weren’t looking for anything fancy after our long day. So I had a burger and fries. Adequate and did not screw it up. A plus for our day. It wasn’t cheap but then again it was in an Autograph Collection hotel. 😀

Room was in need of some TLC as shower drain did not work properly, sink drain didn’t work right and there was a loose floor board. When you stay at this class hotel you expect things to be perfect. So A+ to the concierges and B to accommodations. ",4,2017,10,07
13,A great historic hotel in a great location ,"We used Marriott points for our 2 night stay here. We got in early from a cruise so a room was not available, although an ""upgraded"" room became available while we were still checking in. It took a few hours before the room was ready for us, so we wandered around the area for a while. We got a nice tour of the hotel and learned a little about its history as a private home and then a cotton warehouse of sorts, before becoming a hotel. It really is lovely. The concierge was one floor up from reception and they were marvelous. They made good suggestions for dinner and helped us get tickets printed for the Prado in Madrid, our next stop, and were generally very helpful. Breakfast was nice, with lots of fruits, meats, cereals, sweets, etc. Specially cooked foods, like eggs were available for an extra cost. Our room was a decent size though not huge. There were 2 separate small rooms, one for the shower, and one for the toilet. There was a safe in the room, which I especially appreciate, since Marriott has taken them out of most of their hotels in the US. The bed and pillows were comfortable and we had a king size bed, not always available, especially in old hotels in Europe. There were no clocks in the room, which seemed odd, and the room was not quite as luxurious as most 5 star hotels we've stayed in. If we had been paying for the room in anything but Marriott points, I would probably have thought it was too expensive.",4,2017,10,07
13,Outstanding Service in perfect location,"This hotel offers a fantastic experience in Barcelona.   The staff was absolutely amazing from check-in to the super efficient concierge staff.    Rooms are both beautiful and comfortable.   The restaurant and bar staff were quite fun.   We only took breakfast in the restaurant, but found the offerings to be a nice variety with fresh delicious options.   The hotel itself is located in the perfect location for the casual tourist.   We will certainly stay at this property again.",5,2017,10,07
13,Horrific service ruining our honeymoon,"We chose to stay at Cotton House as the finale of our honeymoon- expecting excellent service and nicely decorated room. Upon check-in, we were offered drinks, free tour around the hotel and the bellboy was very friendly. I was first surprised to see how tiny the gym room (two cardio machines and one set of dumbbells), swimming pool and swimming pool deck were. In the room, the sink for the bathroom is in the bedroom, like one of the cheap motels in the States. We understand it's a heritage hotel and there is lots of limitations on the hotel room if priority is given to preserving the integrity of the hotel's style. So everything aforesaid didn't bother me too much. 

But two incidents prompted my one star review - which is a first. 
1. We were assured by the front desk that we could bring and open our wedding gift, a bottle of champagne, to the restaurant/bar area or the patio outside it, and enjoy the champagne.  Acting upon such advice, we invited two of our wedding guests who were also staying in Barcelona to take a taxi over to our hotel so we can enjoy the wedding gift together. We walked in to the bar, and was told that we were not allowed to bring in the bottle, or even sit in the corner of anywhere in the restaurant to drink it- not even if we separately also order drinks from the bar. My friends were just standing there and I was utterly embarrassed holding my champagne. I was pretty much ordered to go back to my tiny room to drink. I have relayed the advice I was given by the front desk, and the hotel staff looked at me like I made the story up. Later on, I ran into the front desk person who told me I could bring the champagne, and all I got was a ""that's too bad"". 

Recommendation- If your hotel staff has offered your guests something, try not to eat your own words or blame your guests for listening to what your staff say. We can't be more embarrassed and disappointed.  

2. When we opened the door for the service ladies, a mosquito flew in to our room. It wouldn't stop buzzing near my ears and I got bitten multiple times when I was just chilling out on the bed. So I went to the concierge and asked if they have anything that could help get rid of the mosquito, say repellent or ointment. The reply I got was - there's a corner store. Are you kidding me? That's a 5 stars hotel response? The concierge asked me what else they can help me with, and I couldn't help but ask- well, how could you assist me? They ended up offering sending someone to my room and kill the mosquito (which was a creative and almost hilarious suggestion).

So here's my honeymoon- I am at a 5 stars hotel premises, supposedly enjoying my time; and instead I ended up waking up my husband, turning on all lights, and chasing after a mosquito. That's the most hilarious but ridiculous part of my stay. 

After killing the mosquito, we also spent 4 mins calling the concierge to let them know we have killed the mosquito. We were not able to reach anyone. 

To sum up- this hotel is not a 5 -stars facility and its service is the worst I have had in the entire Europe, if not the world. The only time I had worse service was in the middle of nowhere in China with zero star hotel for work. 

Regretting our decision to stay here, I took a look at the management's responses to negative comments on TripAdvisor about this hotel. It's a copy and paste apology which exemplifies how little they care.

I will strongly recommend AGAINST anyone to stay in this hotel.  If you just want to see the cool building and its interior decor, you just need to get a drink at their bar (which was tasty) as there's nothing special in the room. You don't need to pay 500 usd per night to stay and suffer the tiny room, gym, pool and mediocre service.

13,WOW ! Now this hotel is just the very best !,"We stayed here after a week in Barcelona and I have to say that this marvelous hotel was the icing on the cake in one of our favourite cities.
The building, the service , the food , the location: All top notch.
If in Barcelona I would highly recommend anyone staying in this historic old hotel. 
Its the perfect mix of tradition, modernity and great hospitality.
Every member of the team was beyond helpful, polite an friendly. However I must give a special shout out to Alfredo , who with his team form the Gossipium ( Concierge!) helped us out with guides, car rentals, taxis..you name it he made it happen.
So thank you everyone , you are the best !
Stephen",5,2017,10,06
13,Great place but a higher mark-up on the price!,"We were here for a couple of nights, pretty much exhausting our Marriott rewards points. The building was fantastic, with its history and lovely interiors! We had a spacious sound-proof room, and a lovely bathroom. The only downside in the bathroom was that water spread all over the place when we showered - the barricade wasn't really effective. The pool was a tad bit small, we would have loved to take a dip had it been more spacious. However, the breakfast spread was lovely, and the staff were very friendly! Unfortunately Catalonia was on the streets one of the days we stayed, so couldn't enjoy much of the sights the hotel's location offered. We would love to stay here again (someday) when we could afford it!",4,2017,10,05
13,"Nice hotel, great location","Stayed here Sept 17-24.  Great location, was within walking distance to most of what we came to see.  Nicely appointed room with a very comfortable bed.  Most of the staff was pleasant, although I was disappointed with the check-in experience.  I selected a hotel in the Marriott family due to being a Platinum member.  Front desk agent never acknowledged my status until I brought it up.  I was told I was upgraded to a nicer room (#316), which was right off the elevator and facing the Gran Via (the street in front of the hotel), so there was a fair amount of road noise 24x7.  My sister-in-law and her husband made the trip with us, they were in room 210, which had an interior view, and they said it was very quiet.  Our upgraded room didn't appear much bigger than theirs except for the shower area.  Had dinner in the restaurant one evening, the food was very good.  Several good tapas restaurants close to the hotel (e.g. Ciudad Condal).  Overall, it's a fine hotel in a nice area, but the disappointing upgrade experience keeps me from giving this place a perfect rating.",4,2017,10,04
13,Beautiful Property in a fantastic location.,"Travelling as couple on tour of Spain. 3 days & 2 nights at Cotton House.

Check in was efficient. Our room wasn't quite ready so we left our bags and started exploring the neighborhood. In short order we received a call from the front desk letting us know that our room was ready. 

The property itself is really charming. Feels like your in an elegant home with beautifully appointed indoor and outdoor spaces. If it wasn't located in one of the most vibrant cities in the world you would be tempted to remain in the hotel for the entirety of your stay.

Our room was on the 1st floor with a small terrace. The furnishings and bathroom were nicely designed and in keeping with the rest of the hotel. The terrace for our room did not have a view per se as it is surrounded with lush vegetation to shield it from the public terrace and the other private terraces on the same level. As such it felt like a little private garden and was perfect spot for a glass of wine and relaxation. 

We did not use the restaurant other than for breakfast. The breakfast buffet has a nice variety of options for any appetite and the service was quite good.

The location of the hotel is perfect. The L'eixample neighborhood in which it is located is beautiful with loads of shopping (if that's your thing) and restaurants to choose from. Everything is within a short walk: La Rambla, Gothic Quarter, El Born, Barcelonetta, etc. Access to public transportation including the Metro is close by.",5,2017,10,03
13,A real disappointment,"We had planned on staying at the Cotton House Hotel for 4 nights in September but left after one night.  The front office check in staff has not really been trained appropriately and though we arrived early and hoped that we would be able to check in early, certainly understood that check-in could be as late as 3:00.  Unfortunately, we were told that our assigned room was currently being occupied by a ""Platinum member"" and they could choose to stay until 5:00 p.m. and that they were very busy in the hotel and it could take an additional hour to get the room prepared for us.  Very matter of fact, no ""Can we offer you a drink"" or anything just that's the way it is.  

We called our travel agent and she called the front desk and they immediately put us into a room, however, the room was actually pretty comparable to a Motel 6, with marred up furniture and very little room to move around.  Though I do have to say the bed was very comfortable and we did stay one night.  

Some of the staff is quite lovely while others, especially the front desk seem quite frazzeled.  I was very disappointed and we checked out the following day and went to another hotel next door.  I read all of the great reviews so we were quite surprised and maybe just arrived on a rough day.  We stay in many Marriotts and Ritz Carleton hotels so we were expecting much more.",1,2017,10,02
13,Charming,It was a great hotel w great location. Very friendly stuff and nice ambiance as well. Stayed 2 nights and had a very nice time during my stay. Prices are a bit more expensive but when u stay in the hotel u think that they deserve it. ,5,2017,10,02
13,"Gorgeous hotel, brilliant service and wonderful food","We had a faultless time at Cotton House and loved it. The history, decor, tasteful luxury accents and wonderful ""Team Gossypium"" concierge made this unforgettable for us. Perfectly located and faultless, Cotton House Hotel exhibits all the things I love about luxury hotels!

Definitely worth doing the free hotel tour as it is great. And don't miss dinner at Batuar or breakfast either. Just a fabulous hotel that I can't recommend enough!",5,2017,10,02
13,Comfortable Elegance!,"Due to last minute flight changes we suddenly needed a hotel for one night in Barcelona and found this lovely small hotel.  Situated in a great location, we were delighted with the room and it's finishes. The bed was very comfortable, the windows were quite soundproof, we did not hear any street noise!  Public rooms were beautiful and comfortable.  Breakfast was really exceptional, with a vast traditional buffet offering as well as made to order items from the menu.  The hotel has a very nice courtyard area, perfect for coffee drinks and dining.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Easy to walk to area shopping and attractions.",5,2017,10,01
13,Wonderful Charming Hotel,"This was the home of an old cotton business which has been redone as a fabulous  boutique hotel.  The rooms, public spaces, and restaurant are charming and intimate.  The staff is very helpful and the service is wonderful.  This hotel caters to adults, no public spaces or activities for children.",5,2017,10,01
13,Amazing property,"I had been eyeing this hotel for at least a year before we booked it and it definitely lived up to and exceeded my expectations. Attention to detail was everywhere. 

Amazing staff (especially for Spain) great breakfast, great showers, great bedding,
It has it all. If you love boutique hotels and especially are a Marriott Platinum member like myself then stay here when you are in Barcelona.  ",5,2017,09,29
13,"Good, but could be better","Common areas are very nice. Our Panama room was waay too small for the price we paid. The bathroom, while attractive, had no place for our toiletry bags etc.  Using the shower resulted in entire floor being wet.   Lunch on patio was nice, not exceptional. Staff very friendly. Hotel entry is small and many taxi drivers unfamiliar with it.  Main objection was high price for very small room.",3,2017,09,26
13,It's ok...,"My bf gave me a choice of places to stay in Barcelona and I chose the Cotton House because it seems to be close to everything, and it has high marks on its reviews. I think that if I had it all over again, for the money we paid, I would've chosen to stay elsewhere. First, when we were getting off the taxi, I asked the receptionist for somebody to help with our bags. I was expecting a bellboy to help with the bags, but she ended up leaving her post to carry our bags, which I thought was weird. After being checked in, we were given a room, probably the size of my closet. We literally did not even have space to open our luggage completely and unpack; the shower and the toilet shared a space, and didn't even have a wall between them. I mean, me and my bf both thought that this is unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. Being a Marriott Platinum elite status, he immediately complained and demanded to be switched to another room; supposedly, there was a last minute cancellation so they were able to switch us. When we arrived to our second room, it was a lot better with a bathroom and a bathtub, but it still wasn't great. For the money we are spending to stay here, I don't believe that it was worth it at all. Also, I am a little appalled at the fact that a 5 star luxury hotel would even have rooms like our first room. The hotel itself is beautiful, and has a lot of history. The staff are all young, like they just got out of high school. The people working in the concierge were all very helpful. The breakfast buffet had a huge selection to choose from, except they charge extra for hot breakfast. I think that for the money, I would've stayed at the Palace, or elsewhere.",3,2017,09,26
13,"Nice hotel, good location","We stayed on the 6th floor overlooking a courtyard and above the restaurant. This is a quiet floor and we had a nice balcony. The pool is located on the 6th floor as well, so not far away. 
Bed was very comfortable and had nice pillows. Room was not large, but big enough. 
I really liked the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful.The restaurant Batur was excellent for breakfast and dinner. 
The neighborhood is more residential and we found it a nice area to be in. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,09,24
13,Fantastic,"From the arrival till the end of my journey, I just loved the staff and the property. Everyone is nice , listen to your needs and pro active ! The room was amazing as well as the product and quality of amenities ....WOW ! a Must try and do !",5,2017,09,21
13,Best breakfast ever,"An incredible property with a great location! Among many positive hotel highlights, the breakfast must get special mention. The quality and variety of the wonderful food and drink was amazing. Service was incredible. Only hotel drawback we observed was the tiny workout room.",5,2017,09,20
13,A taste of time gone by...,"The Cotton House Hotel is situated where a Textile Mill once stood. The hotel is done in a period of this mill and is warm, charming, beautiful and inviting. The staff was excellent from the doorman, front reception, concerige, restaurant, back to the reception for checkout. The hotel decor is a museum in itself and you can even take a tour of the property. In each sleeping room there is a book of fabrics where you can have a tailor come to your room to take you sizes for a custom shirt and fabric. A must for old world charm.",5,2017,09,19
13,Perfect,"Lovely property, helpful staff, and excellent central location.  The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean with an old world charm and modern amenities.  Unfortunately we didn't even realize they have a rooftop pool until check out!  How did we miss that?",5,2017,09,15
13,Cotton House Hotel,"Cotton House Hotel is in central Barcelona and walking distance to most of the sights. A beautiful and comfortable hotel which used to be the old cotton house.

We were upgraded to a lovely room with a large balcony which was fun for relaxing with wine and cheese.

The breakfast was complimentary since I am a gold member and included a wide variety of items and freshly squeezed green juices which was a treat.

Recommendations--for a 5 star hotel the bath amenities (shower gel etc could have been higher quality with a more neutral scent). Shower and robes and towels were super nice.",5,2017,09,15
13,Pure luxury......,"The Cotton House exceeded our expectations as one of the better small elegant properties we have ever stayed at.  We stayed in the Madras room which had such a beautiful view as well an air of simple elegance. The linens fresh, the towels huge and plush ( we actually purchased a set).... Staff is extremely attentive from the moment you enter until you leave. Concierge...outstanding and helpful in making reservations, canceling reservations... great recommendations as well... The restaurant  we only ate for breakfast but the offerings of fresh fruit to traditional egg dishes was savory.... The rooftop pool has a wonderful view of the main street and Sagrada Familia in the distance....  Yes it is expensive but  if you are looking for a small quiet gem in a very peaceful neighborhood... This is it!",5,2017,09,13
13,Beautiful Hotel; perfect location ,"Upgraded to the Egyptian Room which was beautiful and on the same level as the concierge and restaurant which was exquisitely furnished. Had good experience with the check in and despite our room not being ready were treated to a coupe of champagne and a tour of the hotel

We had dinner and breakfast at the hotel but due to impending rain missed out eating on their beautiful terrace. Nevertheless both meals were very good. 

Location is just perfect for what you need to do in Barcelona, i.e., we were able to walk to all the Gaudi buildings and a long but lovely walk to the beach area

Perhaps too fussy but I did not give it 5 stars as we came back from dinner to find our room had not been made up / had a turndown service - possibly a bit harsh but it was such a lovely stay you just expected them to get it all right. Would thoroughly recommend and would certainly be back",4,2017,09,12
13,Step back in time with great staff BUT NEEDS MAINTAINING,"I took too long to write this review but we had a great check-in with (Miguel?). We came early and understandably our room was not ready. He gave us a welcome drink, which was above and beyond seeing we came before check-in time. I guess other people's crankiness resulted in our benefit. I love Autograph Collection hotels because they are essentially independent hotels that have a lot of charm. You can look up the history but I can say they did a great job with the renovation. My only complaint is the maintenance of the bathroom and cleanliness. The sink was not sealed properly so we had water running down on the floor, annoying. Shower needed to be cleaned and sealed as mold was found in exposed crevices. The white leather chair by the desk is absolutely beautiful but it had some food stuck to it. These are all easy fixes that I'm sure/HOPE they have solved by not. If not, please fix these as this is such a beautiful hotel that it would be a shame to see it run down so quickly!",5,2017,09,10
13,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,"My husband and I just had a wonderful three days in one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. The Cotton House Hotel!  We loved our suite with a small private courtyard!  The staff are all young gorgeous men and ladies who look like Moreland are eager to help!  The biggest surprise was the restaurant where we had a delightful breakfast, lunch and dinner!  They really go the extra mile in a lovely tropical location!  You will love it!",5,2017,09,06
13,"Fabulous, classy, historic hotel in great location!",I stayed at the Cotton House Hotel with my husband and two teenage sons for five nights while on vacation in Barcelona in August.  The hotel far exceeded our expectations!  The rooms and facilities are extremely clean and well maintained!  We enjoyed relaxing and swimming in the rooftop pool several evenings after returning from excursions in the city. The breakfast buffet is expansive with delicious foods to satisfy all tastes!  We had dinner one evening in the hotel restaurant which has a lovely outdoor patio that is a wonderful spot to enjoy some delicious tapas!  The staff all spoke English and were extremely friendly and helpful!  We all felt very welcome throughout our stay.   I highly recommend this gem of a hotel and hope to return myself!,5,2017,09,06
13,Check in Process Was Not Customer Friendly,"The Cotton House Hotel is gorgeous. It is a former mansion with many original features. Just beautiful. We are high level Marriott rewards and actually booked the 2 night stay with points. Our arrival was early, but Marriott rewards allows for early check in. Since there are only 80 something rooms and they were completely booked, we were told our rooms (traveling with another couple) were not ready. That was fine. They held our luggage and off we went. We came back after 1pm and were still told our rooms were not ready. Our traveling companions were informed at 2:30 that their room was available. At 3pm (check in time), we approached the front desk again. We were told the room designated for us was still not ready. At that point, we were told that another room  (a double upgrade) was available and was given to us. The room was a little larger and a very nice bathroom, but couldn't see the double upgrade. The included breakfast buffet was lovely. All of the staff and conceirge  tried to be helpful, but many seemed as they were in training and thus uninformed. I loved the hotel and surroundings; my husband was not as impressed. When we checked out, we had to pay additional euros that we thought were taxes. We later learned we were charged for the ""double upgrade"" since we were using points for the 2 nights. We will be discussing this with Marriott as we were never told there would an additional cost for the room that was available at check in. We thought it was their concession for not having a room for us even when the check in time arrived. Loved the location.",3,2017,09,05
13,Exceeded My Expectations,"I first want to apologize for taking a month to post my review....the staff deserved praise immediately. One of the first hotels I have stayed at in awhile were management and the staff understand superior exceptional service and hospitality. Cudos to management for their training and attention to detail. I had the pleasure of a six night stay using my Marriott points...the property reminded me more of a Ritz Carlton except the staff was much warmer and down to earth. In many ways, the staff shaped my positive experience of Barcelona. To my point, I ate dinner two nights in the hotel restaurant at 8pm at the hour the Spanish say is the time to eat with the wait staff. We enjoyed our time talking and getting to know the staff that we wish we could see them again. Special shout outs to hostess Cristina and wait staff Nuri &Judith. The restaurant also hosts the breakfast/buffet which is exceptional and a tremendous value for everything offered. The front desk is extremely well staffed and offers exceptional security and cool drinks for the weary traveler. The hotel hires many interns who are also exceptional. I was totally impressed by the concierege Madison at Gossipyum. I don't think this is luck that management is hiring and training properly. My wife and I also loved the uniforms of the staff. The women wore an outfit that look like a designer nun outfit which was accessorized with bright lipstick and cool shoes. It reminded of us of a Robert Palmer video from decades past. Not that I use the gym much on vacation after walking miles everyday; however, the gym is a little small for a business traveler. Loved the great air conditioning in the room which allowed us to cool off after walking in the heat. The only thing I would have changed was the fact the housekeeping cart was always located outside my door when I entered the hallway. I regret that I have not visited Spain earlier in my life. I can't imagine a better place to visit than the Cottonhouse, especially for American and foreign tourists.",5,2017,09,05
13,Beautiful Space and Quiet Rooms,"Public spaces are beautiful - I really like the library on the second floor.  Definitely would stay here again.  

Pros:
- Quiet rooms
- Comfortable bed with wonderful linens and pillows
- Big bath towels
- Balcony to sit out on/able to get fresh air in the room
- In room safe

Cons:
- No walk-in shower - instead a deep tub which is not easy to get in and out of when your feet are wet 
- Breakfast was included but they needed to have some hard boiled eggs on the buffet instead of charging €5",4,2017,09,04
13,Nice and cosy place,"I went with my husband for our anniversary and had a wonderful time there. Had a mixed experience, first with bad room, rude staff then to nice balcony room, polite staff after escalation (sigh!). Anyways, the entire stay was made comfortable with nice breakfast. We were given a nice balcony facing room, though the rooms are very small. The pool was one the same floor as ours and it was in open, so really nice on hot sunny day. Breakfast area is great place to sit.",4,2017,08,30
13,Cotton House is King,"We stayed here after a cruise.  My daughter (15) selected the hotel over the Hotel Arts and the Renaissance based the pictures on the website and the central location. Quite honestly, the pictures on the website do not do this hotel justice.  It is gorgeous. We booked an Egyptian room which comes with a king bed and a sofa bed.  Upon arrival, check in went smoothly but we had to wait a few minutes until a staff member could take us to our room.  Since we were greeted with glass of cava, this was a pleasant wait.  Our Egyptian room overlooked the courtyard on the second floor (My daughter loved going up and down the spiral staircase).  I was concerned about noised from the restaurant below but it was never a problem.  The room is small compared to US standard but easily held all our luggage and clothes for the three days we were there.  There is a mini-bar in the room, but you can use it as a fridge for your own beverages even without taking items out.  The room comes with Nespresso machine and we had brought our own capsules but there is a Nespresso boutique within walking distance if you need to buy your own.  There are also several grocery stores near by to  purchase water, beer, wine, and snacks.  We did not get a chance to eat in the restaurant but I agree with others that the breakfast buffet is outstanding.  My daughter's personal favorite was the red velvet cupcakes but I loved the simple iberico ham sandwiches they served.  The pool on the top floor looks small but fulfills its function and was never crowded.  We used the concierge to book the Picasso Museum and the Sagrada Familia.   He was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful, as was all the staff during our visit.  We only have three small issues:  the hotel has a book of tours you can book (and we definitely would have done one or two of them) but we didn't discover the book until late the second day (it  wasn't on the desk but hidden on the night stand); we always had to request three sets of towels each day no matter how many notes we left for housekeeping; and the maid never converted the sofa bed back to the sofa during the day.  As a bed it takes up a lot of the room and makes getting to the small balcony and sitting at the desk difficult.  Just small things that did not spoil our stay and we would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,08,30
13,Mixed Feelings,"The hotel itself is a charming one of kind hotel near many of Barcelona's attractions but far enough removed that quiet time is possible. The outside sitting area and bar is lovely and the breakfast area is adequate. I can't give this a higher evaluation because the inexperienced staff were nice but inept. As a Marriott rewards member I am accustomed to certain privileges such as early check in. We arrived in the morning after a long flight and not only could we not get a room early, but it was not even ready at 3:00pm, the regular check in time. We were told that we were given an upgraded room because of the delay. The room was adequate but I not only can't figure out what made it an upgraded room, I am even more concerned about what my original room would have been like. I'd consider staying here again, and I will say that the manager reached out to me after I wrote to him about my experience, but I'd also look into other comparable hotels for comparison on my ex visit to Barcelona. ",3,2017,08,30
13,"Beautiful centrally located unique hotel, near Ramblas, walk to beaches, old town","Loved this Autograph. Short walk to Las Ramblas and 'medieval' sector, 10-20 minute walk to main city park and spectacular Barcelona beaches. 
As with many Autographs this is a re purposed building - Cotton Exchange in the 1800s. Surrounded by some 4-5 story apartments and other moderate sized hotels. Rooms large enough, terrific beds. Breakfast buffet was excellent, outdoor restaurant in summer was very good. 
Great staff, very accommodating, knowledgeable. 
Rooftop had great views and the tiniest pool!",5,2017,08,29
13,Unforgettable anniversary ,"Stayed for a night celebrating our anniversary. Smooth check in and beautiful appointed room on the 6th floor, very clean and spacious. We found a lovely chocolate amenity and a lovely handwritten welcoming note from the Gossipyum team, which I'm a fan of. The bed was so comfortable and bedsheets so fresh that actually felt like sleeping on cottons buds.
The hotel has so much history it actually looks like a contemporary museum, full of references of the cotton and textile industry all around you. As soon as you enter the hotel, you somehow start a journey to the colonial times. We booked a table at Batuar Restaurant, all of the waitresses that took care of us were very charming and interacting. Food was spectacular, we shared some Indian cuisine tapas as a starter.. delicious! Then a burrata salad and  a lovely cannelloni.. by far the best burrata I've ever had.. so creamy and yummy, I'll be definitely ordering that again in my next visit.
We enjoyed the pool next to our room in the morning and head for breakfast, which had so many delicious savoury and sweet options to choose from. I had the poached eggs and bacon and were so delicious! From the sweet section I had the banana and chocolate chip cake...I had to ask for the recipe! It was such a pleasure treating my partner (and myself!) For our four years anniversary. We are already looking for excuses to go back, well done Cotton House team!",5,2017,08,29
13,One night stay,"Had a marvellous stay here in the Cotton House.
Artfully designed from floor to ceiling its quite a place to stay. Shame it was just one night, but will return again very soon.
The restaurant is good too
Upstairs is a fun plunge pool
Lovely beds too",5,2017,08,28
13,Beautiful Property,"This property is very well placed in the tourist area of Barcelona.  We were within walking distance of most major attractions and many good restaurants.  The hotel is beautiful from the moment you walk in.  The front desk staff are all very friendly and helpful with knowledge of the city.  

Our room was very clean had everything that we needed so have no complaints in that regard.  Please keep in mind that this is a boutique hotel that was developed out of an existing property so the rooms are not massive but trust me there is enough space.

We used the pool at the hotel, again it is not huge but was a great spot for our kids to burn some energy and for the adults to have a couple drinks and catch some afternoon sun.  

My favourite part of this hotel is the breakfast and the restaurant area.  The ambiance is just perfect for any meal and the food was great.  The staff were all very nice and attentive.  It was very clean and everything was well stocked.  

I have absolutely no negative comments about this property so it gets a 5* in my books.",5,2017,08,28
13,One night stsy,"We stayed at Cotton House before leaving for a cruise. The location was ideal - close to main streets  but peaceful. We had a room facing main road and had no issues with noise. The rooms are small but well designed 
Staff were charming and when there was a slight confusion at check in they immediately apologised, sorted it out and gave us an additional complimentary drink   
Breakfast was an excellent selection 
Would certainly recommend this hotel",5,2017,08,24
13,A wonderful week in Barcelona,"Just wanted to rave about our just completed stay at the Cotton House Hotel!
  Even though we arrived about 10am, after a quick, informative tour of the property and breakfast at the hotel restaurant, we were informed our room was available! Our Egyptian Cotton room was plenty big enough for our family of 3 with the sofa bed stored. The bathroom was well appointed, although the shower/tub was a little difficult to get in and out of. The balcony looking over the courtyard was a nice feature, if only big enough for one person at a time. 
  The concierge was helpful all week long, providing directions to the many walkable sights, riding the Metro for more distant attractions and making arrangements for day trips to Montserrat and Tossa del Mar.
  The amazing buffet breakfast is included for Gold and Platinum Marriott Rewards Members. Items such as omelettes and pancakes are not included in the buffet, but are cheaper a la carte than the buffet, if it is not included at your room rate.  The Batuar (onsite restaurant) courtyard was great for tapas and drinks and/or dinner.
  The pool and terrace offer a nice place to cool off and relax in the evening with a  view of the Sagrada Familia.
We wouldn't hesitate to return to the Cotton House Hotel!  ",5,2017,08,23
13,Perfect location and dreamy bed,"We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning after just getting off a cruise ship and we knew our room would not be ready for several hours. We walked in to a very pleasant staff. We were offered water while we went through the check-in process and we were informed that there was a level of the hotel we could use if we would like to freshen up and shower which we did not need but was a nice touch. The hotel stored our luggage for us while we ventured out into the city for a few hours. This hotel was in a perfect location to sightsee around the entire area. After doing a city tour and having a tapas lunch we returned to the hotel and our room was ready early. Upon entering our room it was like a breath of fresh air. Everything was updated, light, airy and pretty. We had a balcony that overlooked the courtyard and faced some residential buildings. It was very pleasant sitting on the balcony and enjoying the beautiful Barcelona weather. The highlight of the room was the king size bed. It was soft and sumptuous, the sheets were made from the softest cotton (hence the name cotton house?) and it was like sleeping on a cloud. It was so comfortable we overslept the next morning! Every staff person was very helpful, informative and polite. I would highly recommend this hotel in Barcelona!!",5,2017,08,22
13,Stunning hotel! Lovely location.,"This hotel has a fabulous Mediterranean feel to it - lazy mornings on the balcony, late drinks in the bar! The dinner is delicious and the staff were very pleasant and knowledgeable. Our room was lovely - bright and airy! The pool area is small but there's so much to see in Barcelona that we didn't mind. The Barcelona electric bikes tour was an absolute treat! We did the tour with tapas and got to see photos of the beach before the Olympics which was a definite eye opener. This hotel has a stunning internal staircase! A romantic hotel for a couples break. It's within walking distance if the usual sights but a bus ticket would be a good idea for ease getting around. Would definitely return. ",5,2017,08,22
13,FANTASTIC,"This might have been the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  The hotel employees are fantastic, the rooms lovely and the care given by the staff is superb.  We happened to be in Barcelona during the terrorist attack.  We were on a bus when my wifes cell phone rang asking if we were OK.  We had no idea what had happened and they told us and were just making sure we were ok.  At that time the bus service stopped and we had to walk, trying to find our hotel.  After asking many questions, night fell upon the city.  We stopped in a hotel and they were nice enough to call our hotel.  The Cotton House sent a car to pick us up.  At the hotel there was a guard at the door making sure only people who belonged there were coming in.  The manager, came from behind the desk to talk to us and make sure everything was fine.  The hotel offered a special menu, since they did not want us back on the street.  The room we had was super.  Well appointed and a shower big enough for 20 people. The next morning they even checked to make sure we were OK.  There was one SUPER employee, Mario, he came to get us and each day would ask us what more he could do.  We have stayed at many hotels, but this one was great.  All the employees are very well dressed and each seems to care about you.  Would suggest a stay at this hotel and if you do, stay hi to Mario.  If there was a 6 star rating I would have given them 6 stars.",5,2017,08,22
13,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights. The hotel is beautiful and front desk personnel were very helpful and friendly. 

We did have a couple of bumps during our stay however. One was the concierge service. On three separate queries we were given wrong or lacking information.   For instance, we asked about the subway or bus service from the football stadium as we're going to a huge game between Barcelona and Madrid. The concierge did give me the subway stops BUT did not mention that the service shuts down at a certain time. We were forced to walk back to the hotel, about two miles at 1:30 in the morning. The city is safe, clean and beautiful so we didn't feel threatened. However, with that little piece of info we wouldn't have stopped for tapas after game. 

Secondly, we wanted to enjoy a bottle of Spanish wine we bought in the city on the outside pool deck. It was closed and locked so we went down to the terrace area. The bar manager informed us we could not drink our own wine but she'd be happy to give us their wine list to purchase. 

As I stated the hotel itself was beautiful and the rooms clean but we did have some irksome blunders. ",4,2017,08,22
13,"Amazing staff, amazing property...","We stayed at The Cotton House Hotel on vacation. We, unfortunately, arrived an hour before the van attack on Barcelona. I was appreciative of the care the hotel staff took for their guests. They increased security in entering the hotel, and they were mindful of people wanting to leave.  They kept the guests informed of anything they knew. 

Our room was lovely and fancy. We are a family of three (and like space), so the junior suite was just the right size for us. Again, the staff was amazing and attentive to our comfort our entire stay. They arranged a time each day to make the pull-out sofa for our 8 year old son to sleep. 

The restaurant in the hotel was great for dinner, but we found it overpriced (even compared to other €€€€ restaurants).  It was good, just the cost of 2 meals elsewhere which was expected, but disappointing. 

The breakfast buffet was amazing. The servers were friendly and attentive. The food selection was fresh and diverse. There were tons of cured meats, breads, cold cuts and vegetables--something for everyone. 

The rooftop pool was also a huge bonus. Not very large, but just the right size for the size of the hotel. It was so awesome to have the pool/lounge at the end of each day before dinner. 

The best part of our stay was the staff. We were greeted every time we arrived and acknowledged every time we left. Whatever we needed, it was taken care of ""with care.""  We hope to make it back to Barcelona some day...",5,2017,08,21
13,Coveted loved the Cotton House Hotel.,"From the perfect location where the hotel stands to the comfort of the best cotton linens in its bedrooms… without doubts that we highly recommend the Cotton House to stay during your passage for Barcelona. 

The hotel takes you on a journey back in time by its interior design and decoration but still with your feet on the modern and contemporary vibe of Barcelona. 
The international staff (very well dressed, we must say too) is the touch of the hotel, by its sympathy and dedication to the guest. A 5star service!
 
The restaurant also wins by its food variety and great flavor. The breakfast buffet variety is thought to all appetites, it includes from fruit to salmon, juices of all varieties and all kind of coffees. 

The pool on the terrace is not that big but serves the purpose for the guest to feel completely relaxed at their own home - and this time, with a special view of the Sagrada Familia cathedral. 
 
The Cotton House offers you the comfort of your own home, with a 5star service and luxury amenities - inspired by cotton and the hotel’s history - and also the opportunity to discover the historic center of BCN as soon as you take a step out of the hotel.",5,2017,08,21
13,Awesome Boutique Hotel,Location is excellent. Staff are friendly and speak excellent English. The decor and atmosphere are fabulous. There is a lovely restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. The breakfast buffet is terrific with many choices. The rooftop small pool and deck was just perfect after a long day of sight seeing to cool off and relax. We were able to walk to every where that we wanted to go. I would go back in a minute. I am a frequent Marriott visitor and this is by far one of my favorite properties.,5,2017,08,18
13,"Excellent location, service, and quality","I have nothing but good things to say about the Cotton House. It's in a perfect location from which to explore Barcelona. The service was excellent from all members of the staff from the moment I pulled up to the hotel to the moment I left. The rooms are very nice and modern given the hotel was only opened a few years ago. The rooftop pool is very nice but small. The fitness center is also very small, but neither of those qualities concerned me. I would definitely recommend anyone to go and I will likely return the next time I'm in Barcelona.",5,2017,08,16
13,Very nice hotel but too stuffy,The hotel is really nice and in a good location but I would not choose to stay here again.  We have stayed at many lovely boutique hotels throughout Europe and have come to know what to expect but this just felt uncomfortable.  I almost felt sorry for the staff as it was evidently clear their uniforms and scripts were so highly stressed they were unsure how to react when prompted for something off script.  Great if you are looking for somewhere to just rest up and good location for sightseeing. ,3,2017,08,15
13,Perfectly Wonderful Week at Cotton House in Barcelona!,"My husband and I have just returned from three weeks in Europe. Our first week was at the Cotton House and we have only wonderful memories of our time there. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly  and offered a drink. All the staff is truly exceptional and only too happy to offer assistance. Everyone is friendly and seems to truly  enjoy what they are doing.  The breakfast is lovely with many choices and beautifully presented. I believe they charged extra for omelets or pancakes, but we were more than happy with the variety of things they put out. My husband loved the bagels and smoked salmon and I liked trying their Iberian ham which is a specialty of the region. Fruit, yogurt, baked goods, cold meats,cheeses  and cold cereal were available. The servers couldn't  have been more attentive. The scent of cotton that permeates the hotel is very pleasant. As Marriott gold members, we were upgraded to a lovely room on the top floor.  It was beautiful. Loved the balcony and the rain shower was relaxing. The location of the hotel was ideal. We walked to Sagrada Familia and to La rambla. Even bought a bathingsuit at Cortez Anglais where we had the most delicious hot chocolate ever!  Our nieces and their families were staying at an air b & b and we were able to catch a bus right across the street to their apartment. We used taxis, buses and the metro and all were close to the hotel. I asked the concierge to recommend a good Italian restaurant that was casual and Luigi's was suggested. Wonderful!! We went with my nieces and their families, including a little one who is not quite two. It was the perfect choice and absolutely delicious. They have a big brick oven for pizza and make their own pasta. We had quite a variety of meals and everyone was very happy. Nice wine list as well. Thank you to the Cotton House for suggesting it. All in all, our time in Barcelona was something we will always think of with wonderful memories due in great part to how happy we were at our stay at this lovely hotel. Should we return, the Cotton House would definitely be our hotel of choice. Do yourself a favor and try it. You won't be disappointed!",5,2017,08,14
13,Great and worth it,"Stayed there on business. The hotel is well situated and very charming. The room was only ready at 2h30 so went to the pool to wait. I knew this would happen so planned ahead. The staff is very nice. The only negative from my point of view, and I have commented about this in other hotels, the new Marriott policy to perfume the ait in all hotelz with the same scent should be better handled. In some it is discreet and in others like this one it is overwhelming. Besides this small inconvenient my stay was really good. Good food and breakfast had a lot of choices. The bathrooms are huge and the bed sooo comfortable. Will stay there again.",4,2017,08,13
13,"Smells good, nice location... BUT","We enjoyed our stay in Barcelona, and the hotel is lovely, however a few things rubbed me wrong.  

Breakfast: be warned, this is NOT a breakfast you may be used to. As Platinum members we get complimentary breakfast, and in 90% of the places we stay it's usually good enough to sustain you for most of the day. Here, it's carbs, carbs, carbs, carbs, carbs, yogurt, fruit, and a few deli meats. No eggs, bacon, sausage, omelets, potatoes, or pancakes/waffles unless you order off the menu and pay. Also, my husband wasn't feeling well so I wanted to take him a muffin to the room. I was stopped by a server and told that wasn't allowed. I COULD fill a plate and they would BRING it to our room (as room service and an added 4 or 6 euros. Don't remember). Umm. No. 

Room: DO NOT get a room facing the main road. The windows have no sound barrier and all night it was cars, mopeds, sirens, people, music. All. Night. However, bedding is one of the nicest we've ever had. 

Bathroom:  BE WARNED.... if you are disabled or unsteady on your feet, the shower/tub bathroom combo is a death trap. Super super super slippery. I fell in shower once, laid a giant towel on floor for traction, then getting out I had to hold onto door jam to keep from falling on the super slippery tile (or laminate) floor. As I was holding on, the super heavy shower room door slammed in my hand. The bathroom was seriously treacherous. Wear shower shoes or something. I'm not kidding. 

The airport strike: not the hotels fault, but we flew out about 10am. Opening our door at 7am was a flyer-outside the door, not slipped under- stating the airport was having a strike and to arrive at least 4 hours early for flights. Hmmmm.  First we had heard of it. Also, no other notice was given at the hotel: no bulletin board or flyer in elevator. We barely made our flight. 

The smell: I loved the smell. It was like Bath and Body Works Cotton. A+ for that. 

Staff:  all the ladies dress in cotton dresses and look impeccable. Guys dress to the nines also. Kinda Stepford Wife life, but classy. 

Location: Really nice. Close to everything in the city central. We didn't use a bus, metro, or HOHO bus once. I lie... took a bus to beach. Everything else is walkable. Also, short cab ride from airport. But... BE WARNED... on a Wednesday the ride cost 26euro. On a Sunday, 45euro. Weekend premium. I was not happy. Take the Aerobus. Google it. ",3,2017,08,13
13,Boutique feel with amenities of a large hotel,"Our family of four stayed in two rooms, which I believe were the ""larger"" rooms but were still pretty tight. However, they are designed efficiently and we did not spend much time indoors. The rooms faced the back and were very quiet with small balconies that we enjoyed using. We opted for the breakfast buffet, which is heavy on sweets and other continental offerings. We enjoyed the bar and had drinks in the garden which is very pleasant. The roof deck and pool was a nice bonus and gave my 11 year old a place to have fun with a few other kids, just big enough to accommodate them. The staff was very helpful and gracious and the location was ideal.",5,2017,08,08
13,Great hotel and excellent service,My experience at this hotel was great.  From checkin by Laura we were greeted very warmly.  The staff have excellent customer service and go out of their way to please you.  The room was quite big as I had expected a small room based on some of the reviews I read before leaving.  The room was very luxurious.   They allowed me early check in.  Their free wifi is also the fastest I have ever experienced in any hotel.  The location was perfect for visiting les rambles and the road with the luxury shops.  Great 5 star experience.,5,2017,08,04
13,Wonderful Oasis in Barcelona,"We spent one night at Cotton House to fit in a quick visit to Barcelona before boarding a Mediterranean cruise.  What a jewel!  The property is in a converted house (think Rockefeller mansion) that later became headquarters for a cotton trading company (hence the name).

The rooms are small as expected in Europe but beautifully appointed.  We lacked for nothing.  My wife especially enjoyed the light fragrance that permeates the hotel ... it is made from cotton flowers.

The hotel staff was extremely gracious and helpful.  We were offered a drink upon arrival and checkin was efficient.  They offered us a quick tour of the hotel which was fascinating.  During the tour, our bags were delivered to our room which was on the top floor.

The breakfast buffet was outstanding.  The staff was very attentive and the food was delicious.  And don't miss the marshmallows in the library.

The location is fantastic for visiting the city.  We will certainly be back to the Cotton House.",5,2017,08,01
13,Beautiful Boutique option for Marriott loyalists ,"Part of the Autograph collection of Marriott boutique and unique hotels, this is a terrific option in the Eixchample neighborhood.  The building was a commercial property that was beautifully renovated to a hotel but kept much of the old world charm and architectural integrity of the building.  Excellent staff at the front desk, and restaurant/bars.  We used Marriott points for two rooms and agreed to pay a $40 per day upcharge for the Cotton King Room.  These rooms are larger than the base Madras rooms which must be very small. There is a beautiful roof deck with pool, and bar with a view of the city including the Sagrada de Famiglia. The hotel is within walking distance to the La Rambla, El Born and many other neighborhoods.  Our favorite meals were at El National, a cool food hall.  We also liked Tapeo in the Born neighborhood for Tapas.  There is a good Italian restaurant very close to the hotel called Luigi if you need a break from Tapas.  The only thing I did not like was the gym, it's very small, otherwise I really enjoyed staying at this very unique and original hotel.  I also recommend using Barcelona Day Tours for sightseeing options.",4,2017,08,01
13,Awful room-inexperience staff,"I made a reservation for my birthday for my daughter and my self with 2 beds.  The room wasn't ready so I went to the pool deck.   I asked the pool attendant for sunscreen.   She gave me her own because the hotel didn't provide her with any.  I asked to call down to see if my room was available. She said there was no phone that she had to use her own cell phone.  She told me she was an intern.  She was very sweet but very inexperienced.  It turned out that -1/2 the staff were temporarily interns.  
When I got my room it was the size of a postage stamp.  There was only one bed. I had a cold and when I complained they told me there was no other room available. They said that they never guarantee how many beds.  The room was so tiny we cold not fit a roll away in it.  The staff was sweet, but were not honest in meeting our needs.   On top of that, my daughters watch went missing never to be found.  Don't stay at this hotel.",1,2017,07,28
13,Charming Property in the Heart of Barcelona,"We loved this hotel. It was in a perfect location just a 15 minute walk from the ocean and 10 minutes from Las Ramblas. There's tons of restaurants around and the neighborhood is charming. I'm very glad that we stayed here instead of the Ritz-Carlton. The Cotton House was charming and it actually felt like being in Barcelona, not a glass skyscraper.

Rooms were very nice. The showers were huge and cotton amenities were provided, living up to the hotel's name. The lobby/restaurant were beautifully decorated with 5 star service. There's history to the hotel as well (cotton was used here for textiles) and the library was beautiful. Their specialty cocktails were very good, and the breakfast buffet was a great continental breakfast that included mint water and green juices. The pool was on the terrace with a view of Sagrada Familia. It was a small pool though, and the fitness room was small as well. 

I would highly recommend the Cotton House and I'd stay here again.",5,2017,07,28
13,Service not 5 star level,"Rooms are good but small. During my visit I had multiple cases of mistakes in service and not professional handling of claims. I got my room only 6 pm, wrong luggage was brought to my room, Waiters forgot my order in restaurant and they over charged me from my credit card from rooms. 2 star staff in a 4 star hotel.",1,2017,07,28
13,"Classy, Stylish, great staff, great location","A step back in time but with all the modern features.  Swanky hotel with great staff.  Classy breakfast topped off with an elegant evening menu.  The rooms vary in size but come with only the best cotton linens and towels.  Makes you want to take some home and you can buy them if you want.  Located one block from the main shopping and dining district, three blocks from Gaudi's home and just a stroll from the Sagrada Familia or the wharf district.  An international staff that takes care of all your needs.  A little pricey at times but well worth the expense.",5,2017,07,27
13,Beautiful hotel ,A beautiful hotel in a great location. Delicious food and staff anxious to please. We would certainly stay here again. The decor is what I imagine a hotel in India might feel like. We upgraded and had a courtyard room. Lovely atmosphere ,5,2017,07,27
13,The best hotel in Barca," This is obviously not a cheap hotel, but it is definitely worth the money. The location of the hotel is great. You are within walking distance of all the main city attractions. The hotel rooms are modern and luxurious,    The grounds are beautiful and well kept, and the staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. The reception manager, Juan, is an asset to this hotel. It was almost 1:00 AM when we checked-in and we were very beyond hungry. Juan took the time to help us find a restaurant close by that was still open on a week night . When we came back from dinner, he offered us a free bottle of Cava and desert to take to our room. We would definitely stay here again and will continue to tell anyone we know to stay here. ",5,2017,07,23
13,4 star hotel pretending to be 5 star,"People/service: Friendly staff, but service not at a sophisticated level
Room:  Nice theme, but not high quality furnishings...rug in room was very worn out, sofa looked nice but cheap and uncomfortable to sit, pillows used were low quality (felt like pillow purchased at a dollar store)
Hotel ambience:  Modern historic, but not so keen on lobby music as it felt like a night club which for me is more stressful. 
Value:  Not great if",3,2017,07,22
13,Above & Beyond - Best Place to stay in Barcelona,"Simply the most spectacular place to stay in Barcelona.  The staff went above and beyond to make my stay one of the most memorable experiences of my lifetime.  The hotel is exquisite. I staff was attentive and really anticipated my every need during my stay.  If you want to experience luxury and amazing service. Stay at the Cotton House. The food was excellent and next time I find myself in Barcelona the Cotton House is the place to be.

Thank you Cotton House Staff. You guys are simply the VERY BEST!",5,2017,07,21
13,Superb service in a boutique setting,"The staff is incredible at this small boutique hotel.  My two nights here were very enjoyable.  The main floor is spectacular with sitting rooms, a library area, restaurant and terrace.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and sitting outside for a nightcap on the terrace is highly recommended.

The decor and furnishings of the public rooms really stand out.  There are examples of fabrics, products and ledgers from the building's previous incarnation as a club for textile suppliers and tailors.  Even though my room was on the fifth floor, I usually took the spiral staircase up and down so as to soak in the sights of the spherical lanterns and the rest of the building.  

There is a very small fitness area on the top floor adjacent to the deck and pool - the latter is tiny and is really just for immersion rather than swimming unless you have it to yourself.  Views over the busy street include various hills and highlights of Barcelona such as the tops of the towers of La Sagrada Familia.  

Rooms are small and the decorations are simple in a stark white.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the bathroom amenities fantastic.  My only complaint is that I asked for a room away from the street but did not receive one.   Even though there are double-paned windows I could still hear the traffic below.",5,2017,07,21
13,Very Charming and Luxurious ,I loved the Cotton House. It is very surprising when you get to a hotel and a doorman opens the cab door and takes care of your luggage and offers you water and sweets while you wait to check in. And he asks you about your trip and everyone is so nice and they take care of you and when you get to the room you can't believe your eyes because everything in the room is so gorgeous ans there's a room separately for the shower and the bath tub and another one for the toilet and the room is so modern but at the same time you are on a building that has a whole history behind it. That's how you will feel at the Cotton House. It's so lovely and gorgeous and I'm out of words. ,5,2017,07,19
13,CCC ..... Comfortable Colonial Charm!,"A warm welcome awaits from the enthusiastic young team who will do their best to make sure you enjoy your stay. This beautifully restored building, the former Cotton Exchange, makes for a perfect stay in the heart of the bustling city.  Exploring the delights of Barcelona are easily done from this central location with lots of advice on hand.  Comfortable well appointed rooms with my favorite Ortega bath products and super comfy beds make for a good nights sleep. Not before a delicious cocktail or two followed by dinner on the terrace. Breakfast is served in charming surroundings of old world colonial charm with memories of of the former cotton trade. A bespoke shirt making service is available to guests.  An added bonus after a hot day of sightseeing is a dip in the rooftop pool.  A perfect spot for a weekend city break",5,2017,07,19
13,Whimsical boutique hotel with incredible design and details,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Cotton House for two nights at the end of our multi-city trip to Spain. Not only is it decorated impeccably, but the building itself is a work of art and I really appreciate how the hotel focused the design around the architecture instead of trying to change the building to fit their intended design. The bar area on the patio is lovely and a welcome reprieve from the busy city, as is the roof top pool. I loved this hotel and hope to stay here again the next time I'm in Barcelona!",5,2017,07,19
13,Good hotel but missing services,"Every one in the lobby is super friendly and say hi to the customers.  They are also very polite to answer your questions.  

The breakfast items are great. The service is either great or none.   If you are siting in the center of the restaurant, you will get multiple servants attention and they constantly serve you coffee and clean your table.  However if you are sitting on the side near the entrance, sometimes no one will serve you for like 20 min.

The house keeping has the same problem. The service is either great or none.  The first 2 days were great that they cleaned our room in the morning when we went out.  The 3rd day we went out at 11am, when we came back at 4pm, the room was not done yet even we put a ""yes"" sign on the door.  I called the front desk and the night shift house keeping manager came and had some maid to clean our room.

When we went out the 4th day, I specifically told the maid who was at the hall way to clean our room when we walked out.  She said yes.  However when we came back 4 hours later, the room was still not cleaned yet.  I called the front desk and someone said he would send someone.  But no one came.  I went to the hall way and found a house keeping manager.  She said she would send someone. Later the same maid came over to clean our room.  Apparently the maid just completely ignored my request to clean my room in the morning.

Overall the stay was just ok.",3,2017,07,17
13,Excellent service starting at reception and ending with restaurant and bar services.,"Historical building that used to house the cotton merchantss association. , thus the name, Afterwards it  was a private residence. Renovation and conversion to a hotel was done tastefully and kept many of the original features such as ceilings and floors. 
We were very well received, given a very good corner room and attended to, whenever we needed tips for trips, tourist attractions etc. Breakfast is really good with good choices.",5,2017,07,16
13,Such a lovely hotel!,"This quaint hotel is in an easily accessible area for the subway or taxis. The architecture is absolutely gorgeous and has been restored beautifully. The rooms are a bit small but well done. The outdoor patio for dinner was a real treat. Never got to use the rooftop pool as we were so busy but it was lovely. Great views. Great staff, very helpful. ",5,2017,07,13
13,Excellent experirnce,"As a lifetime Platinum member, my fiancé & I search out Marriott hotels. Unfortunately, he made the reservation so my platinum lifetime status was not honored. He is a gold member and we did get a room upgrade so everybody was very accommodating in that respect. 

Why we loved this hotel:

-welcome glasses of champagne and a little chocolates! I downed two glasses before we went upstairs! No one rolled their eyes when I came down on a regular basis to take more chocolates
-Great air-conditioning in the room -you know us Americans…
-excellent soap, bath gel, bath salts and lotion in the room
-turn down service and complimentary waters every day. 
-room 304. We had a lovely view overlooking the outside terrace and bar below us. 
-we took advantage of the pool on the sixth floor. Very small but water temperature was perfect and the lounge chairs were great and the towels fluffy & large. 
-excellent service by the staff. Are only request it was not honored was that we needed a lint brush for my fiancé's pants and the concierge was unable to find one. A recommendation: have one available. 
-wonderful service at the outside bar where we enjoyed a bottle of cava and a bottle of delicious Spanish white. Complimentary potato chips which we devoured as well!
-whoever complained on Trip Advisor about their breakfast was just mean! The food choices, quality and quantity were outstanding- everything we wanted was available plus desserts! Desserts for breakfast! 

We thought the location was outstanding and the hotel is spectacular. We would stay here again. ",5,2017,07,12
13,Good Hotel,"Overall, this is a gorgeous hotel with great designs and furnishings. The rooftop pool is 
a nice touch, and you can see the Sagrada Familia off in the distance. While the hotel was impressive on the inside and service was great upon arrival, we felt the service was a bit lackluster for the remainder of our stay. For the price point, I believe better value can be found elsewhere.",4,2017,07,11
13,Boutique Luxury Hotel in Barcelona,"First time staying at an Autograph Collection hotel. We loved the personal attention and luxurious hospitality. Hotel is within walking distance of both the L'Eixample neighborhood, Gothic Quarter and Born neighborhoods. Easy walking distance to great shopping. Hotel is very comfortable, super luxury bed and bath. Concierge and staff friendly and helpful.",5,2017,07,11
13,Over rated. ,"Cotton House

If you wish to charge like a first class hotel, you can't manage like a second rate hotel. This hotel isn't value for money. Nicely decorated premises and well located but poorly managed. We checked out after 2 days and went next door to El Palace (the old Ritz) which was superior in all respects and literally half the price. 
The manager of the Cotton House needs to start managing the hotel. We phoned the manager to share our concerns and never had our call retuned. Says everything you need to know about the lack of interest in the guest experience. 
Staff are very friendly but mostly untrained. They need to spend less time talking to each other and pay more attention to their guests. It all has a whiff of 'Faulty Towers' about it. Day 1 - no housekeeping turndown service, Day 2 no housekeeping at all. It took 2 phone calls to finally get our room cleaned. The large maid's trolley stayed in the narrow corridor near our room all day. Coffee machine in the room was nice to have, but Day 1 we only got 1 decaf capsule and 1 caf for 2 guests and no milk. We spoke to the housekeeper. Day 2 we only got 1 decaf capsule and no milk. Breakfast choices are limited and more characteristic of cheaper European hotels. You will need to ask 2 or 3 times for a coffee even though the ""barista"" only needs to press a button on an automatic coffee machine you will recognize from airport lounges. Coffee capsules in a first class hotel restaurant? Really? Step off the elevator on the 2nd floor onto carpet that is filthy and stained. The fitness ""centre"" is a fitness closet. Small, little equipment, and no water. On Day 2 it was locked. Went to reception who said they would send a colleague who never arrived. Finally managed to get a maid to open it after a long wait. Rooms have the world's smallest complimentary water bottles. Must have been a real effort to source them. We tried lunch and being a sunny day thought we'd eat out under umbrellas on the terrace. Not allowed. So we asked to sit by the windows. Not allowed either as they were being reserved for guests who might just want drinks. There were none. Asked Concierge to book a restaurant for 9pm and without consultation received confirmation he'd booked for 9:30pm, which the restaurant had for 10pm anyway. Small point, but no complimentary newspaper offered (El Palace offers many). This is a second rate hotel charging first rate prices.

13,"We loved the hotel, the staff and the location!","Staying at the Cotton House was the perfect way to start our vacation. The hotel is fantastic, very historic and amazingly comfortable. Our room had a great balcony which we enjoyed very much after a long day of sightseeing. The best night sleep we have had in a long time, the room was very quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. The location was very close to everything, a short walk to all the sights. Also, there is a small grocery store a couple doors down that has a great selection of local beer and wine.",5,2017,07,10
13,Cotton Comfort,"We have recently discovered the Autograph hotels and found them to suit our tastes so when planning a trip to Barcelona it was our hotel of choice. We spent 5 nights here and loved every minute.  The location worked perfectly for us. It was just a short walk to Plaza Catalunya where we could could pick up the on/off bus and the bus to the airports, walk through the Bari Gotic and down the Ramblas.   Even after a day of sightseeing just walking back into the hotel was a treat.  Beautifully appointed, with a well trained, enthusiastic, knowledgeable staff they made our stay a pleasure.  As others have written, the quality of the service is first class without being pretentious in any way.  The bar and terrace in the back of the hotel are not to be missed.  Gin and tonics anyone?  The best we have ever tasted.  Breakfast buffet selections were outstanding, but for those not wanting to spend the money for the buffet, many 5 euro selections were also available.  Our room was small by American standards, but perfectly appointed with the best of everything from the linens to the toiletries.  For those travelers who agree that a wonderful hotel experience enhances the pleasure of the trip, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,07
13,Fabulous,Beautiful hotel with a lot of history.  Library is nice and historic.  ...nice size hotel with wonderful service. Concierge was superb. Good location.  Comfortable big rooms with high ceilings.  Patio is wonderful for a drink.,5,2017,07,07
13,Top notch ,"I travel quite a bit and am not easily enthused by hotels, but this place is unbelievable. Quality, decor, comfort, and especially staff/service is really impressive.  I will definitely be back to the city of Barcelona and The Cotton House will be a part of those travel plans!!",5,2017,07,07
13,Fabulous,Beautiful boutique hotel in a great location in Barcelona. Within walking distance of most of the major attractions. The building is full of charm and character. Beautifully appointed - stylish and elegant. Service was excellent. Highly recommended,5,2017,07,07
13,Great Hotel in a fantastic location,We stayed here on a recent trip to barcelona. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was located close to the metro which was very convenient. Also the wifi at this hotel was very fast which I appreciated. I'd highly recommend staying here!,5,2017,07,04
13,Best Barcelona has to offer,"I've been to Barcelona a few times, and I can't believe I never stayed here before! The staff was amazing and the bartenders made it a point to outdo themselves nightly. It's within waking distance to everything. Stay here",4,2017,07,02
13,Classy Cotton House,"Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona is rapidly becoming one of my favourite hotels in the world.  The public spaces are stunning - from the vintage mirror-lined lobby and spectacular staircase through to the beautiful library and colonial style bar - and the renovation of the old building is sophisticated and stylish without being too precious.  The rooms are bright and sunny (Ive been lucky enough to usually get a high room with a balcony and views over the city to the sea) with huge beds that are almost impossible to leave.  But what really elevates the hotel is the quality of service.  Every single person - from the amazing concierge manager Alfredo Martinez and the reception staff right through to the maids and bar tenders - is friendly, helpful, efficient and charming.  It's an absolute pleasure to be around them.  It's all to easy to forget you're in wonderful Barcelona and instead just hang out by the rooftop plunge pool and order another gin and tonic....",5,2017,07,01
13,Amazing Hotel in Barcelona,We we recently stayed at the Cotton House Hotel.  It is beautiful.  It is located in a great neighborhood in Barcelona.  It is the perfect place to stay when visiting this beautiful city.  We would stay here again for sure.,5,2017,06,22
13,Spent a great week here!,"Stayed at the Cotton House in March, celebrating my husband's milestone birthday.  We really loved this hotel and the staff was really great and friendly.  The breakfast is amazing and the rooftop bar is lovely.  The hotel is set in a beautiful building and is so quaint and feels homey. Also, great location, central to everywhere you want to go in the city.  One caveat was that ""concierge"" was not very knowledgeable and need better training.",4,2017,06,22
13,A Memorable Occasion at the Cotton House Hotel,"Special events come too infrequently, so we chose to stay in a unique and lovely hotel for our Anniversary celebration.  We had traveled in Spain twice before, but this was only our second time in many years to visit Barcelona. 

We were pleased with our large, light and airy room on the fourth floor.  The king-sized bed was extremely comfortable and attractively appointed.  The bath facilities took a little practice before perfecting the shower sprayer, but we were successful. 

We appreciated our initial tour of the hotel complete with details of the building's history by our enthusiastic guide.  There are several appealing common spaces from the dining area to an attractive and slightly masculine library and, ultimately, to the pool on the top floor.  The view of Sagrada Familia was fascinating and encouraged several photographic attempts.  Although there was an elevator for our use, we were attracted to the beautiful stairway, or stairways, within the Cotton House....another photo op.   

Since we were re-living our visit of long ago, a tour of Sagrada Familia was a must.  Additionally, a tour bus ride showed us other fascinating aspects the city as well as a fun visit to Montjuic.  We were near enough to the Barcelona Cathedral that we were able to walk and enjoy the sites along the way.  Yes, shopping was included.

Although our visit was only for three days, we were so please to wrap up our three weeks visit to France and Spain with our unique stay at Cotton House Hotel.  Yes, we would encourage our friends to have a similar experience on their next visit to Barcelona.",5,2017,06,22
13,History and Ambiance in the Heart of the City,"What a treat to spend time in this beautifully-restored building in the best area of the city. (Well, I'm sure there are people who might opt for another section of this vast and gorgeous city, but it's definitely in the top three). This hotel is the site of the former cotton industry in Barcelona and the entire place is ""cotton-themed"" from the décor to the names of the various types of rooms. It's plush without being garish, and the staff is top-notch. Our room (the Madras) even had a small balcony with two chairs, which was nice since many of the hotels we stay in don't even have windows that open! The morning breakfast buffet was excellent in both variety and presentation. We will definitely consider staying here again when we venture to Barcelona.",5,2017,06,22
13,Stunning hotel,"Such a stunning property. We were taken away by its beauty on our first visit. Well, our second visit was even better. The staff and Mr Martinez took excellent care of us and made our stay incredibly special. We can't wait to go back!",5,2017,06,22
13,Mixed feelings....Good Hotel but have stayed at better for the price,"If you are rich and have no problem throwing out cash with minimal expectations, Cotton House is for you.  The overall hotel was very nice, the location was good, but that may be an issue with the layout of Barcelona.  Service was either excellent or non-existent, dependent on the individual.  At least we were burning Marriott Reward points so my wallet survived.",3,2017,06,21
13,Home Base in Barcelona,"We stayed here for two nights prior to boarding our cruise ship. The hotel was lovely... a perfectly restored cotton mill with all the modern amenities that make a fine hotel. We appreciated the historical ""aura"" very much. The rooms were quiet, the bathroom was very clean and modern, and the bar/restaurant area was charming. Being greeted by a glass of champagne was a wonderful little perk!",5,2017,06,21
13,Great location.  Cool old building. Nice hidden spot in the bustle of Barcelona,We stayed here last week while at the end of a three week driving Spain vacation.  It was lovely. A bit of a delay in registration but was resolved to our satisfaction. Hotel is very close to city center so it is definitely in the right spot.  Very well appointed. We were on the 6th floor with pool and fitness so that was nice.  Restaurant was nice.  Service is definitely slower but that is cultural and we learned to slow down. Lol. Did the pop up Indian Chefs dinner which was very yummy. Breakfast was hardy and they did eggs if asked.  I would stay here agin if I come back to Barcelona.,5,2017,06,21
13,"Beautiful hotel, nice staff and a great location too!","The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The staff very professional, kind and helpful!  Our room was excellent, with a beautiful bathroom and great shower.  Our room came with a complimentary meal (I'm not one to eat at hotel restaurants) - we used ours for lunch - and the food was amazing, we had the best croquetas of our 4 days in Barcelona here.",5,2017,06,20
13,Love this hotel and staff is amazing!,"We took our 4 adult kids to Madrid and Barcelona for Christmas. We used our Marriott points and stayed here. Best choice we made. The location is great. We were in walking distance of almost all the major sites. The rooms are not large by American standards but I have never been in a more well laid out room set up. There's plenty of room for luggage and stowing things. The entry hall of the room also has the large bathroom sink and 2 closets. The toilet and shower each have they're own separate, closed door room off of the ""entry hall"". The set up is genius! So it doesn't seem like you're on top of each other. Plus there is a pocket door that closes to separate the bedroom from the bathroom/entry hall area. Our rooms had balconies but it was too cold to use.  Beds were so comfortable! Breakfast was great! Staff was friendly and helpful! The bar was awesome! We hung out there a lot. We are traveling to Barcelona again this summer and I would like to stay here again. My family all talks about how they love this hotel ! Doesn't feel like a Marriott at all. ",5,2017,06,19
13,AMAZING Hotel + Service,"We have stayed at ALOT of Marriotts over the last 5 years and the Cottonhouse is without a doubt the best one we have been to. This was our 3rd stop on a 4 stop trip through Europe and it was so refreshing and relaxing. 

It is a beautiful hotel and everyone working there is absolutely wonderful. Every time we were in the lobby, we were greeted with champagne :) Reyes went out of his way to help us during our staying with taxis, information, etc. 

This hotel also has THE most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in. It was like a little piece of home while traveling. We can't say enough good things about our experience here. 10 STARS!!!!!!",5,2017,06,19
13,Awesome hotel,Formerly the private residence of a wealthy cotton merchant this beautiful boutique hotel has a fascinating story to tell and a staff that loves to share the story and provide excellent personalized service. Can't wait to go back!,5,2017,06,17
13,Fabulous historical hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights and can't find one thing to complain about. Our room was very comfortable and the staff the most accommodating we've ever encountered. The breakfast was very complete, and we enjoyed the bar for an after-dinner drink and coffee.We accidently left some personal items behind, and the staff is making arrangements to send them back to the US. This is a wonderful addition to the Marriott collection. BRAVO!",5,2017,06,16
13,Feels like a boutique European hotel,"Although this is a Marriott property, it has the feel of a local historic hotel.  It is excellent in all regards:  the public areas, sleeping room, restaurant and most of all the service.  The staff is friendly, helpful and capable.  The location is very good.  It was an easy walk to almost everything including the Gothic area, La Rambla, Sagrada Familia, etc.",5,2017,06,16
13,Wonderful experience,"Overall a very nice experience. This is a well run boutique hotel with motivated staff, not large but functional rooms, excellent breakfast choices and quality service.  No complaints of any sort, will certainly go back!",5,2017,06,14
13,Great Choice,What a wonderful experience.  Beautiful room with a view.  Great location. We were treated royaly by the desk not only on arrival but every time we passed it.  The breakfast included many choices and service was outstanding.  We stayed three days prior to our cruise and used a taxi from airport the first day and to ship.  The taxi system is very good.,5,2017,06,13
13,A Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"There are many hotels in Barcelona from which to choose. If you are looking for a hotel that offers impeccable service, attention to detail and a warm and intimate atmosphere then The Cotton House is the place to stay. Great location. The rooms are spacious for a boutique hotel. Character is evident throughout. Big thick towels, Egyptian cotton sheets, breakfast buffet with a variety of delicious items are all standard. Not to be missed.",5,2017,06,12
13,"Service and luxury feel lacking, cramped rooms","It's sad to say we left this property feeling very disappointed. The rooms are poorly sized and apportioned, lacking sufficient towels and no complimentary water. Calls for more towels go unanswered and served. The breakfast is disappointing. It's absurd that they charge for eggs, especially in an all inclusive package, that costs over 500 eur/night. The service during breakfast was comical, with a lot of employees around but uncoordinated and unable to even serve coffee in a timely manner. 
Given the price point of this hotel, we expect better. If you are used to the service levels of ritz, mandarin oriental, even W level properties you will be disappointed. No doubt it is a gorgeously appointed property in the communal areas but the lack service, attention to detail and luxurious feel leave one feeling that this property is grossly overpriced and over hyped.  Pass. ",3,2017,06,11
13,Fabulous ,"My husband and I choose this beautiful hotel for its location, price, and style. We were not disappointed. When we arrived our room was ready so we immediately went up to drop off our stuff so we could start exploring Barcelona. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a large bath and sitting area. The staff was helpful with directions and recommended a cool place to have lunch while walking around the area. When we returned at the end of the day we went directly to the fantastic patio and got comfortable with drinks and modern lounge music. What a treat. After a long day of travel and sightseeing I fell asleep on my husbands shoulder and woke to one of the fabulous staffers covering me with a blanket. Just one example of the careful and courteous service we experienced at the Cotton House. This hotel is absolutely beautiful. Every detail is crisp and elegant. Breakfast was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The location is ideal because all areas of interest in town are near enough to enjoy but feel removed enough for privacy. We loved our stay. Thank you cotton house for making our first trip to Barcelona a luxurious one. ",5,2017,06,11
13,Wonderful and convenient hotel,Stayed here this month before a cruise. This is an old historic hotel that goes  back to 1800's . Staff is very friendly and supportive. Continental  breakfast is great and more that enough for breakfast. The hotel is close enough to most attractions so would stay again if i visit Barcelona. ,5,2017,06,09
13,All around excellent hotel,"This is one of the most enjoyable hotels I've stayed in.  It has a great location in Barcelona. The building is a converted mansion, which retains many amazing late 19th century architectural elements. The staff were all very helpful and courteous.  The rooms are a little small, but they use the space efficiently.  We had a small balcony overlooking the courtyard, with functioning shutters (which was cool).",5,2017,06,08
13,Extraordinary Experience,"This was a mixed business and pleasure trip and as Marriott brand loyalists, while we would normally stay at a larger business focused property, we decided to stay at the Cotton House.  It met and exceeded all of our personal and professional expectations.  The accommodations are fabulous but most of all we appreciated the superb assistance with several challenging business needs. We can't help but single out Albert, the bellman, who not only moved more than a dozen heavy boxes for a business event in/out of our room but also chased down a van taxi so that we could move the boxes in one taxi instead of two.",5,2017,06,08
13,Historic hotel in prime location,"The hotel has a quiet entrance considering how grand it is on the inside. The palace hotel, located right next to it, has big bold red banners and occupies the corner, whereas the Cotton House has a pair of small brown banners marking its entrance. Once you step in, however, it opens up into a beautiful 19th century lobby. On the first floor (note that the lobby/entrance is floor 0) there is a library and ""cotton"" room guests can relax in, or even have a tailor hand-make a shirt for them. Shirts aren't cheap - expect to pay around 300 Euros.

Perhaps the best architectural highlight of the hotel is the spiral staircase. I recommend you take it at least once, even if you are on the 6th (top) floor. There is also a set of marble stairs that make a grand entrance between the 0 and 1st floors.

There is also a restaurant and deck on the first floor. The restaurant is fine for breakfast, and the deck is fine to relax on with a drink, but the non-breakfast dining leaves a bit to be desired.

As of June 2017, there is an Indian pop-up restaurant advertised in the hotel, which turns out to be an additional menu to complement the existing restaurant menu. The menu presented to us was prix fixe only for the Indian pop-up, with a somewhat larger drink selection. Also, as to be expected in a nice hotel, the pricing for items on the menu is exorbitant compared to nearby places. A single drink will cost more than the menu del dia at nearby restaurants, and a liter of water is 6 Euros here.

There is a rooftop pool and deck, which also serves food and drink. Also expensive but very convenient if you want to relax by the pool. Note the pool is quite small and shallow, and there are limited deck chairs here (around 10) and on nice days it can fill up. Also on the top floor is a small fitness room, which has an elliptical and an exercise bicycle but no treadmill.

The rooms are comfortable and clean, and noise is not a problem. Robes are available in the room, and the bed has a foam top which makes it very comfortable to sleep on. Some rooms have a balcony with two chairs, though these face the interior courtyard and deck. It's not the most scenic but it's nice to relax on.",4,2017,06,07
13,"Perfect location, small and charming","We were recently in Barcelona for our son's wedding and stayed here.  It is a lovely hotel, small enough to be cozy but large enough to have that nice old school luxury hotel feeling.  The old cotton trading building has been very thoughtfully converted - the bedrooms and public rooms are well decorated.  The staff is very friendly and the service is prompt and professional.  We will be staying here when we return to the beautiful city of Barcelona!",5,2017,06,04
13,Wow! Just beautiful ,"Wonderful service from the greeting at the door! Check in was smooth and our cases were stored until a room was ready so we headed out to explore Barcelona following advice from the knowledgable concierge. Room was wonderful. Quiet and relaxing. Unfortunately the toiletries were too perfumed to use but we loved the box of shaving kit and toothbrushes for use if needed. 
Evening on the outdoor terrace was lovely. Quiet, relaxing and great drinks. Good recommendations from the staff. 
Breakfast - amazing. Great selection of meats, pastries, fruited etc. best I have ever seen. So fresh and I'm sure local or made on property. 
A night to remember!!!!",5,2017,06,04
13,Sadly Unorganized and Mismanaged,"The experience was negative form beginning to end.  they cannot get reservations correct to save their lives and they promise the world but deliver very little.  the hotel is beautiful, in a great location, and the staff are very friendlybut that didn't make the experience any better. There were so many issues i had to get out of here and stay elsewhere.  Please take heed to this warning!",2,2017,06,03
13,Beautiful boutique hotel,This is such a beautiful boutique hotel that is part of the Marriott chain. It is a very old historic building which has been restored. Rooms were nice size for a European hotel and bathrooms were also spacious. Buffet for breakfast was excellent. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful. They have a small exercise room on the top floor (6th) and a small pool with a sun deck area. I stayed here twice during a two week period and one of the times I stayed in one of their suites which was so unique and beautiful.,5,2017,06,02

Longtime Starwood Gold members, converted some points to stay at this Marriott property. First time to do so, would do it again. Good bang for the buck option. Marriott treats you better!

R O O M
Originally booked a Madras room, asked for an upgrade and got the Cotton room. Always helps to ask. Check-in process could have been better. 

The room itself was spectacular, marrying modern conveniences with turn-of-the-century, almost British Colonial design in that ""organized chaos"" fashion employed by the interior decorator in the rest of the hotel. The bathroom was stocked with Origia, which are silicon-, paraben- and gluten-free products. Housekeeping was impeccable, everything was spotless.

A M E N I T I E S
Rooftop pool was perfect for unwinding after a long day of exploring the city.

D I N I N G
Breakfast selection was good; for an extra €5 per person, we ordered one a la carte item from the menu, usually eggs. 

Gluten-free options were excellent. Tip: ask for ""pan sin gluten"" if you need gluten-free bread. Most restaurants will have it in Spain.

Service was very slow; on the first day, the staff completely forgot about our order. 

On our last day, after saying we had a train to catch and had about 75 minutes, they said it wasn't a problem. We ordered the duck rice and the burger, and a drink. It took more than 30 minutes, and the duck rice was inedible, with the duck being very tough while the inside seemed undercooked. The burger was flavorless. They comped the duck rice and offered free French fries, and the ""pan sin gluten"" (warm on the outside, frozen cold oh the inside) arrived, and it was a nice effort and they were very polite, but we barely ate our food and had to leave to catch our train. One of the staff members offered bottled water, which was a nice gesture.

S T A F F / S E R V I C E 
Hotel employs plenty of earnest interns (read: junior staff from colleges around the world, some from Les Roches in Switzerland and Le Cordon Bleu in France, along with others from Spanish universities). 

While there are some senior staff who supervise their work, the ratio could be tipped in favor of more seasoned staff members. 

At the concierge desk, for example, we asked about private tours but kept being stirred toward big bus tours. When we needed help booking first-class train tickets while the Renfe site was down, we suggested clearing the cache and using an incognito browser, and the interns impatiently said it wouldn't change pricing; we tried to stay patient and said clearing the cache could probably help with the site issues (we both work in tech and knew that we were talking about). 

Generally, someone at the hotel should remind the interns that their guests are used to a certain service level; they shouldn't presume otherwise.

The senior staff, of course, were excellent.

A beautiful place to stay in Barcelona, a true respite from the bustle of the city. Perhaps a true executive chef with a strong point of view and menu can push this property to truly five star. Would stay there again.",4,2017,06,02
13,"Beautiful, well-located special hotel","I absolutely loved our stay at this beautiful hotel, which to me defines a 'boutique' hotel-- fairly small, very stylish, and luxurious in a fairly understated way. We had a room with a view of the Sagrada Familia cathedral from our room, and despite facing a fairly main road the room was completely quiet. The hotel is also located in a wonderful location, very central and walking distance to many of the key tourist sites like the cathedral and the Gaudi house.

The bed, linens and bathroom were all wonderful and we loved the amazing-smelling bath and body products. The breakfast in the lovely conservatory-type restaurant and drinks later on the patio also made one feel like you were really on holiday in an exotic location. 

No complaints whatsoever and very pleased with our stay.",5,2017,05,31
13,Stunning Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"Absolutely a perfect hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. The building is an absolute architectural gem. When we arrived our room was not ready so we opted to wait in the lobby for our room.  They did offer a tour of the property as well that I took advantage of.  They explain the history of the building and what they have done to preserve it. Upon getting our room (102 - an Egyptian room) we were really happy (after 24 hours of travel).

The room was magnificent.  It was very large compared to European standards, and even slightly bigger than what you would find as a standard room in most American hotels.  The ceilings on the 1st floor are 14-16ft tall so that made the room feel even bigger. The room had the best A/C which is also nice for a European hotel.  The bathroom was nice, double sink, great amenities, and a tub/shower combo.  If I had a complaint, it would be the shower only has 1/2 glass wall to keep the water in while you shower, so the floor did get pretty wet - BUT the had the best rainfall shower head that made you want to stay in the shower forever.

We also had a nice private patio.  At first I was bummed that I did not have a view from our room, but we grew to love this patio.  At night we could sit out there and enjoy the sounds of the bar outside, enjoy our cocktails in our boxers, and just relax. The walls of the patio were covered in blooming jasmine so that made it really nice.  We loved the privacy the patio provided.

The bed was amazingly comfortable and the sheets were divine.  I guess if ""Cotton"" is in your name, you are going to have good bedding.

The service was really good, we did not need to use the concierge as we had pre-booked everything, but they had several on staff.  We also did not use the restaurant as we wanted to explore and find smaller places to eat. We did get drinks one night at the bar.  The service was poor, but I think there was a miscommunication from the server to the bartender as only one drink showed up.  After waiting for 25 minutes we went to leave and they had the 2nd drink ready and comped both which we took back to our room. The cocktails are truly an art there, very handcrafted with unique ingredients. We would have gone back had it not been for the poor experience, but I wont hold that against the hotel as everything else was so good. 

In addition to the bar patio, they also have a rooftop patio with a plunge pool and loungers. During the summer they have a small bar set up there too.  It was just not warm enough to go swimming, but if I was in Barcelona for a week, I would have spent a couple afternoons there. 

If you are looking for a hotel in Barcelona, check this out. Yes, it is pricey, but you get what you pay for.",5,2017,05,29
13,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service, well located","This is a beautiful hotel - the rooms and common areas are very tastefully decorated. Location is great and easy walking distance to city sights, shopping and food.

We stayed in a room with a balcony facing the courtyard / hotel patio. The covered balcony was very nice and usable. The room was clean, comfortable and functional and had enough space by European standards. The shower was oversized with great water pressure. Room was extremely quiet - free from internal hotel sounds as well as outside noises from the patio. 

The hotel restaurant is very nice with a good selection for breakfast. The outdoor patio is a great area to have drinks in the afternoon or night. 

Service was excellent - front desk, restaurant, room service and housekeeping. Staff are very accommodating and attentive - room requests are responded to within minutes. Concierge was very helpful in helping to make restaurant reservations. 

Overall - highly recommend and would return.

13,Our family highly recommends this hotel and really enjoyed our stay,"We had an excellent stay at the Cotton House Hotel and it all started with the wonderful staff. The team, (front desk, restaurant, bell staff, housekeeping, concierge) were incredibly kind and very helpful. They went out of their way to make our stay comfortable.

The location is terrific and is perfect for walking both to the old town and to the fancier shopping area.  The restaurant in the hotel has a great outdoor deck and the atmosphere is fun and relaxing (cocktails are great, only downside is you can't have food on the deck). The breakfast spread looked amazing though we didn't actually eat there. 

We used the concierge extensively, particularly for restaurants and for baby sitting service for our small daughter. The restaurant recommendations were great and were just what we were looking for. The baby sitter was wonderful, she did a great job interacting with our daughter and we were very, very happy with the service. 

One down side, the base level rooms are very small so if you want space I would look at upgrading to at least one level up.",5,2017,05,26
13,"Lovely, quiet hotel in the middle of Barcelona.","Very luxurious Marriott property (rooms a bit small, but that seems to be European), with good service. Centrally located, and they were very nice about special arrangements for my mobility scooter. Loved it!",5,2017,05,26
13,A perfect 10,"As a lifetime Marriott platinum member I have spent more than 1100 night at Marriott properties and the Cotton House has been one of the best stays I have ever experienced. 

Service. 10.  The concierge is available to help with everything.  Including a Mini Cooper convertible they had delivered to the hotel for our day trip to Montserrat. 

Food.  10.  Not only is the restaurant and terrace gorgeous, the food and service are top notch. 

Location.  10. Central to everything 

The staff is well trained, accommodating, service oriented.  The hotel property is beautiful.  

Highly recommend a stay at the Cotton House if you are in Barcelona 

",5,2017,05,25
13,Beautiful Hotel and great location,"This is a very unique and beautiful hotel. The building has historical status and because there were things they couldn't change about the building some of the rooms have configurations that are a little unusual. Don't be afraid to ask to see other rooms if you're unsure about the room. The staff is very accommodating and will work with you. We loved, loved our second room. We ate at the restaurant because we got in late and it was quite good. The breaksfast is very nice and they have a beautiful terrace and will are you a great gin and tonic.",5,2017,05,24
13,Wonderful hotel!,"My husband and I stayed at Cotton House for 3 nights at the beginning of May. The hotel itself was beautiful, with clean and comfortable rooms. The staff was very kind and helpful. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, and the food was plentiful and delicious. The pool on the roof was nice to come back to at the end of an afternoon to relax at before getting ready for dinner. Even though our room was on the busy street (not a courtyard view), we slept soundly through the night and could hardly hear the traffic below. Wonderful experience overall!",5,2017,05,24
13,Will definitely return,"My husband and I stay in luxury hotels across the world and found the Cotton House to be on par with the best we've been to. The staff was immensely professional and helpful, everything was very clean and spacious and the hotel itself is gorgeous. Upon arriving we received a tour of the hotel with some history, which we've never had before at a hotel. It was so personalized, and allowed us to get to know both the history and the staff better. The food at the restaurant was great and the outdoor patio off the restaurant is a wonderful place to relax after a day of sightseeing. The hotel is also in the perfect location-close to everything but not in the middle of the busiest area, making it a great retreat. We will definitely return.",5,2017,05,23
13,Perfect in every way!,"Everything about our stay at Cotton House was excellent, I do not have a single negative thing to say.  We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights on our honeymoon.  From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel so welcome.  They greeted us with champagne and quick tour of the hotel while our bags were taken to our room.

The entire hotel is absolutely GORGEOUS... the most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed in.  My favorite spots were the breakfast area/bar, the outdoor patio, and the rooftop pool deck.  You can see the towers of Sagrada Familia from the pool deck!  

The room was just as lovely as the rest of the hotel.  I thought it was rather large by European hotel standards.  We also had a small covered balcony that overlooked the outdoor patio with seating for two.  It was nice to sit out on the balcony with wine in the evenings before we went out for dinner.  Given that the hotel is on a major road (Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes), I was shocked at how quiet the whole hotel was.  

The continental breakfast was fantastic - highly recommended!  They had breads, cheeses, cereal, yogurt, sandwiches, juices, coffee, and much more and all if it was delicious.

The staff was also excellent.  We used the concierge quite a bit to book a day tour of Montserrat, wine tour, sailing cruise, concert tickets, and dinner reservations.  They were able to charge all our excursions to our hotel room, so we didn't have to worry about payment to the tour companies.  The staff greeted us by name every time we entered or exited the building, they really were amazing.

Possibly the best part of this hotel (besides the many I've listed above) is the location.  It is the perfect location for exploring Barcelona.  We were able to walk almost everywhere, and getting a taxi was no problem whenever we decided to do so.  Walking to Placa de Catalunya took about 5-10 minutes, the Cathedral took about 15-20 minutes, walking to the beach took about 30 minutes.  

Like I said before, I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about Cotton House - everything was perfect!",5,2017,05,23
13,AN AMAZING HOTEL IN AN AMAZING CITY,"My family (5 of us in 2 rooms) and I spent 5 nights at the Cotton House Hotel in the third week of March to celebrate a milestone birthday.  Not a huge fan of chain hotels but the Cotton House Hotel is a true exception.  Although it is part of Marriott's Autograph Collection there is nothing chain hotel about it.  

From the start when I booked the hotel via email to the time we checked in, throughout our stay and when we checked out, the staff was simply outstanding, friendly, courteous, knowledgeable, professional and helpful.  They portray a classic yet relaxed sense of formality that is very European but seldom seen nowadays.  The staff is very thorough on any requests with frequent follow up to ensure that our stay was satisfactory and enjoyable.  For example, 2 of us had lost our luggage.  From the time we checked in until 2 days later when the airline finally delivered the luggage, the staff gave us proactive updates 2-3 times a day until the bags arrived.  Simply outstanding.

The hotel itself was an old Cotton mill that has been meticulously renovated with old artifacts and architecture left in place.  Upon check in they present you a glass of refreshing Cava and give you a brief tour of the hotel and its history.  Well done.

The rooms though small are very modern, efficient and very comfortable.  They are decorated in a colonial theme reminiscent of an old Cotton plantation.  The housekeeping staff is excellent, very thorough and accommodating.  

The restaurant offers an extensive and outstanding breakfast that is a great value.  Evening cocktails in the outside patio or the library is very relaxing and a great way to soak up the atmosphere.

The rooftop mini pool and work out rooms offers a great panoramic view of Barcelona.  

The concierge team was outstanding and very helpful in securing reservations in hard to get restaurants and with general suggestions on sights, insights on local secrets, etc.

The location is outstanding and very close to all major attractions.

Without a doubt an amazing experience.  The Cotton House is our 'home' in Barcelona.",5,2017,05,22
13,Totally Enjoyed Our Stay Here,"This hotel is unique for it's history as an old (1800's) textile factory and the lobby and lower floors reflect that in a wonderful way.  The rooms are good sized with comfortable beds and well appointed bathrooms.  The staff at the front desk and in the bar/restaurant areas are very friendly and try hard to please.  The women at the concierge desk also went out of their way to be of help with directions and planning for sightseeing.  There is a nice outdoor patio garden and we enjoyed sitting out there when it was warm enough (we were there in February).  This hotel has a great location that is within walking distance of the main area of the city and many good restaurants.  We had dinner at the hotel one evening and enjoyed the meal we had.  The ambiance of the place as well as the friendly service made it a very memorable and special part of our trip and we would definitly stay here again if we return to Barcelona.    
",5,2017,05,22
13,I am smitten...,"Only go to this lovely hotel if you like the cleanest accommodations, delicious meals, an attentive staff, a beautiful historic building and the wafting smell of jasmine coming in through your balcony.  Seriously, I love this hotel. And it is in the perfect city, Barcelona.

I can't wait to return...",5,2017,05,22
13,"Amazing Staff, and Beautiful Hotel","We recently stayed here for 3 nights on our trip to Spain, and had one of the best experience during our entire trip in Spain. As soon as we arrived, we were quickly checked in. We were upgraded to a nicer room. We loved the room and décor, everything in the room was very nice. Hotel is centrally located with most of the attractions within walking distance. Subway station is just 2 minutes walk, which can pretty much get you around the city easily. Consistent with Autograph hotels, this hotel offers only Continental breakfast but it does have some very good selections. We enjoyed it very much and you can always include an omelet for 5 euros. We really wanted to try the restaurant but didn't have time for it. We will definitely return here for future trips.

Staff all around (front desk, restaurants, concierge service, and house keeping) were totally amazing- very friendly and helpful. We just want to thank you for making our vacation memorable in Barcelona. You guys are the best!!!",5,2017,05,21
13,Perfect Historic Hotel,We had the pleasure of staying at the Cotton House prior to our cruise. The hotel itself is a gorgeous historic property conveniently located between La Sagrada Familia and Paulau de la Musica as well as other sights. The staff could not have been more courteous and helpful! Our room was perfect (506) with a courtyard view. We were even surprised with a birthday treat of wine and sweets!💖 We highly recommend this charming hotel and look forward to staying here whenever we might return to Barcelona!,5,2017,05,21
13,Fantastic!!!,"This hotel was amazing - we stayed in the Egyptian suite which was beautiful with a cute terrace.  The pool was a refreshing treat - small but perfect for a dip after a long day walking all over the city.  Very few people took advantage of this amenity so it was even more of a treat.

Equally important- all of the staff were so kind, helpful and accommodating- they helped us feel right at home with their genuine kindness!  Many thanks to all of you!!

I hope to have an opportunity to come back again and enjoy this treasure of a hotel!",5,2017,05,20
13,"Clean, small noisy",We stay on first floor in an Egyptian room for $500.00+ an night and was next to dining room / bar patio and was very noisy.  Staff was pleasant and room was clean.  I even had to sign out on a sheet of paper an umbrella on a rainy evening(no trust).  I felt it was awkward,3,2017,05,20
13,Very small room but cool property,"10 night stay is far too long in such cramped quarters with tiny window overlooking nothing. Decent bathroom, great bed linens, and competent housekeeping once we told them 4pm service was not acceptable. ",3,2017,05,18
13,"Fabulous, must stay!","Beautiful, conveniently located. Common spaces are lovely, rooms beautiful.  Service is well-intended, but uneven...some great, some a little untrained. Overall, however, a fabulous place to stay...will return",5,2017,05,17
13,Classic service & ammenities!  Wonderful,"Barcelona's Cotton House Hotel is a true classic!  Location, rooms, service, well trained staff who anticipate your needs, décor, cocktails & food are all first rate.  We stayed for three nights and there was not one disappointment.",5,2017,05,17
13,Jewel in the City,"We spent 3 nights at The Cotton House and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The architecture and décor inside are magnificent, and the staff was very friendly and more than capable of dealing with our very limited Spanish.  The rooms are a good size with all the amenities, and the restaurant was top notch (we ate two breakfasts and a dinner there).  The location is very close to a number of landmarks and there is a taxi stand right on the corner as well.   We would definitely go back.",5,2017,05,17
13,excellent hotel,"great location, great service. One of the best and most relaxing hotel I have stayed in.
Staff very helpful with everything, and a great breakfast. Lots of areas inside the hotel to relax and great cafe area at the back in the open.
Decor throughout and history of the hotel was amazing.",5,2017,05,17
13,Loved the history of the place in cotton trading,"Location is fantastic, we had many places to visit, not far from the sea , La Rambla and lots of attractions. Room was nice and spacious, bathroom is usual. We had a room on the main street, but view was very pretty and no noise or disturbance at all. Breakfast was outstanding , with lovely seating both indoors and outdoors on the terrace with gardens. Team is really nice, knowledgeable and helpful.  Make sure you check hotel lounges and halls, plenty of interesting things about cotton industry history ad trading. Very special place , would definitely recommend",5,2017,05,17
13,Beautiful hotel in heart of Barcelona!,"Gorgeous renovated cotton textile mill that is now a  Marriott property. Comfortable rooms, gorgeous hotel, great location to walk or short taxi to all the sites in Barcelona. Would recommend for couples or families with older children. ",5,2017,05,16
13,Great beds,Love the quaint feel of the hotel. Lots of great picture perfect details with charm. Great bathroom design and amenities with an amazing restaurant and local flavor wine and spirits selection at the br,5,2017,05,16
13,Wonderful experience!,"The Cotton House Hotel, Autograph Collection was excellent in all ways.  With such a central location, we could walk to most major attractions such as La Sagrada Familia.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The rooms were beautiful, clean, quiet and comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was delicious!  We loved the interns from all over the world who helped plan our day and were able to get us tickets when needed.  We would highly recommend this hotel if you are planning a trip to Barcelona.",5,2017,05,16
13,GREAT Hotel and experience,"My wife and I are experienced travelers and booked this hotel because it was connected to the Marriott family of hotels.
The property is truly outstanding and the location is perfect for ALL activities one might want to enjoy.
The staff was on par with any Ritz Carlton property and the rooms and restaurant were truly special.
We had the opportunity to work with one of the Concierge staff..Anna.  She not only helped with a few last minute site bookings but stayed late one night to help solve an airline issue (canceled flight) and completely exceeded our expectations for responsiveness and complete satisfaction.
We will be back and will recommend to all our friends and family and suggest anyone looking for a wonderful hotel experience to book here",5,2017,05,16
13,"Amazing hotel, staff, and service","I love hotels that have history and character and The Cotton House fit perfectly. I had a 2nd floor room with a balcony overlooking the restaurant. It was quiet and very nice to hear the soft music of the restaurant in my room as I relaxed with the door open. 

I ate the majority of the meals at the hotel. Asking for drink and food recommendations, the staff did a perfect job!

I have nothing but compliments for every aspect of my stay from the welcome Cava, the tour of the hotel, friendly and helpful staff, food, room, common areas.

I will definitely be back, maybe even this Thursday. :)",5,2017,05,16
13,Noisy,The Hotel is beautiful and the staff and service is wonderful. We did have trouble sleeping due to the noise in the courtyard bar patio area. There was a party drinking and laughing loudly until 12:30 am on a Sunday night.   After two calls to the front desk it was all quiet at 1:00 am. We had a balcony room overlooking the courtyard and the hotel piped music and crowd noise was loud.  Evidently there are no closing hours for the outdoor bar until there is a complaint!  The hotel is in a nice location and very walkable. The room was not huge but still very nice. ,3,2017,05,16
13,Best Hotel Ever!!!,"I travel quite a bit, and have NEVER received this quality of service.  Its my 3rd day here and still have another 2, but felt compelled to put in my review right away. 

In addition to the top-notch staff, the hotel is absolutely stunning. This is a must stay hotel for any traveler.  Location is great, too. Right next to  a street where all the shopping happens. 

",5,2017,05,14
13,Superb!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Cotton House in a room with a balcony & was the best thing we could have done when choosing a hotel in Barcelona. The room was beautiful, quiet, with a very comfortable king size bed & lovely bathroom.This has to be one of  the best hotels in Barcelona, its a beautiful building, great location, great staff, always very attentive, where nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast & restaurant food was excellent. We tried the pop-up Indian curry tasting menu by Atul Kochar, the Michelin 2* chef which was excellent. Stay here & you will not be disappointed. The Lonely Planet Guide Book states that ""you will not want to leave"", how true!",5,2017,05,12
13,An Amazing Hotel and Staff,"Upon arrival and thereafter, it became apparent fairly quickly that the hotel would be one of the highlights to our trip to Barcelona.  We arrived early after flying all night and Marc Samanilgo (not sure of spelling of his last name, sorry) immediately starting checking to get us into a beautiful room with no waiting.  The entire staff from the front desk to the concierge to the entire restaurant staff were amazing. Every staff member we encountered was super courteous, friendly and professional. We especially want to thank Pierre, who was an intern working in the restaurant and was delightful.  Nuri was wonderful and even got us tea and great cake from breakfast at the end of a long day of sightseeing. Batuar, the restaurant on site, was amazing.  We had dinner two of our three nights in Barcelona at Batuar because the food was so delightful.  And Angelo Virzl was an outstanding manager. We were lucky to be there on April 22 which was one of the dates for the hotel's Algodonera Market Lab.  This fun event was on the courtyard of Batuar and including music, food, wine and great artisans.  The Cotton House Hotel location was perfect and in walking distance to many important sites in Barcelona including Sagrada Famila.  We would highly recommend The Cotton House Hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.  We thank everyone there for a wonderful experience in a beautiful city.",5,2017,05,10
13,Unique find,"The renovation of this property is exquisite. The common rooms display the history and elegance of years past.  Rooms are modern and comfortable. The outside bar/patio is perfect for relaxing and enjoying a drink, unfortunately the bar manager doesn't allow you to eat outside fearing the food will get cold (it was low 70's) but we did persuade him to allow us some Tapas outside. There is free WIFI though out and if you have the option of breakfast or points grab the breakfast, it is a treat!  Our only glitch was check in and check out; our room wasn't ready as we arrived early however we had been up for almost 24 hours and of course tired.  We waited on the patio as we were told by a young women ""it won't be long"". After an hour we checked back and were eventually told housekeeping was doing the room now.  It was evident this women was not staying on our situation  so we continued to wait but across from the desk. Five minutes later were were told they hadn't started the room yet and had another for us.  Now we had been upgraded so I never 
knew if we had a ""lesser"" room or if there was any difference at all. Then at check out, the SAME women then charged us 40 Euro per night more.  She aggravated me so much I just said fine and we left.  The facility is beautiful and worth the stay, just avoid that women!",4,2017,05,09
13,Look forward to going back,"Absolutely amazing hotel at a very convenient location. The service is amazing, all the staff are all smiles & extremely helpful. The rooms are bright and spacious. Concierge, reception & service staff are top notch. Really enjoyed our 2 nights stay and will definitely stay there again.",5,2017,05,08
13,Beautiful and Relaxing,"The room was beautiful. Large king bed. Bathroom had a shower and tub. Balcony over looking a courtyard. Staff were friendly, allowed us a late checkout. I would stay here again, handy to all the areas you would want to visit.",5,2017,05,07
13,"Excellent hotel, perfect location","Excellent hotel within walking distance of the historic center. There are plenty of restaurants and metro stop nearby. The hotel is located in a historic building, which is also very interesting, with many common spaces.
The rooms are large with extremely comfortable beds. From the upper floors there is a very nice view of the city. We had breakfast included, which although continental was excellent with a great selection of dishes.
The service was at the level of the hotel and it was excellent. Especially I want to note bellmans.",5,2017,05,06
13,Great hotel in a good location!,"We stayed in the Cotton House Marriott for a long weekend in Barcelona and we loved this hotel, from the helpful staff to the well decorated room (ours had a balcony). Would definitely stay here again. This hotel is in a great location, close enough to walk to restaurants and attractions.",5,2017,05,06
13,Good but not great,My third visit. Overall the first time I was there a year ago was the best. Concierge was not overly helpful with off of the norm needs. Hotel restaurant very good and room clean. Just not anything special ,3,2017,05,03
13,"Excellent Hotel, Great Location and Lovely Service","Stayed here for 4 nights and had 2 rooms at the hotel. Both were on an upper floor and had beautiful little balconies facing toward a courtyard. This is my first time in an Autograph Collection Hotel and would definitely come again. Hotel was beautifully  furnished, has a colorful history and a warm staff. Our room included a traditional Spanish breakfast and was quite good. Over all I give this property high marks and an overall excellent rating.",5,2017,05,02
13,"Great location, wonderful staff","We absolutely loved this hotel. It was walking distance to attractions and dinning.
Our room was beautiful, with a balcony overlooking the Main Street. This room had everything we could ask for from free wifi, to wine, if you wanted it. Huge shower , especially for Europe, large walk in closet and plenty of space to relax.
This staff was unbelievable! Going above and beyond. They couldn't have been more helpful, from making sure our room was good enough,helping us find our way around the city, to great dinning suggestions. I wish we could have stayed longer and been able to enjoy it more. Mark, the manager was the best!
",5,2017,05,02
13,Comfort seeker,"We absolutely loved this hotel-the service, the friendly and helpful staff, the comfortable room, I can go on and on.  The staff went totally over the top to make us feel welcome and our visit enjoyable. Our stay contributed to our enjoyment in Barcelona-the concierge assisted with information and bookings at sights/restaurants, saving us a heap of time. We've had some excellent stays at Marriott properties but this one provided a special memory. Loved the treats upon arrival too!",5,2017,05,01
13,Gorgeous!,"Stayed here in April 2016 using points. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The breakfast was delicious. We stayed in one of the rooms with a small veranda which was magical. Well worth it, but if you aren't paying using rewards or points, it's pretty pricey. Proximity to tourist attractions is off the beaten path a bit, but popular spots are mostly within walking distance or a short subway ride away.",4,2017,04,29
13,Great experience...,"At the heart of Barcelona, this 19th century hotel is a peace of Art and magnificent Architecture.  We have been delighted by the staff members during our 4 days.  From our arrival, we understood what customer service means to them.  In the bar, at the restaurant, for advices of all kinds, we had always somebody available to listen to us with smile and professionalism.  They always met our requests and expectations, what a team.  It is not cheap but definitely value for money.  The place to be for a guaranteed successful stay in Barcelona.  Kind regards, Philippe",5,2017,04,27
13,Very Nice Boutique Hotel,"Beautiful property centrally located and within walking distance to most major attractions, high end shopping and great restaurants.  Rooms are nicely appointed, bathroom tub and shower set up are quite original.  Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful although upgrades are not readily available even for premier platinum status until 3rd day, we passed on it as our room was nice enough to not warrant the move to a lower floor suite.  

Concierge staff was hit or miss, got some bad directions and advice by some, others had good recommendations.  Double check, generally they did not seem to have experience or a good feel for the area. 

Bar (Batuar) atmosphere was very elegant with very attentive staff, cocktails were pricey.   Daily continental breakfast was plentiful with large and varied options, however not much change from day to day, gets a little boring for longer stays.  

Enjoyed the property and staff.  Would stay there again unless we wanted to be on the beach...",4,2017,04,26
13,Could have been 5*,"This is a really lovely hotel and almost sneaked in at 5* in my book, but two key features disappointed. 

Housed in a wonderful old building, that was previously the cotton traders HQ, the hotel occupies six floors and has grand, warm and intimate public spaces.  Some really thoughtful art hangs on the walls and the overall decoration is well put together. 

Service was always lovely from a young, local crowd. 

So what was poor?  First, the wet-room floor was a potential killer, slip-sliding all over the place.  This clearly hasn't passed standard Building Regulations for anti-slip.  Second, the amount of light seepage into the bedroom was sufficient to read your book with all the lights off and the curtains closed.  They're simply not wide enough, not installed correctly and too small. 

All this is a shame, as this could have been a top-notch experience. ",3,2017,04,26
13,Must stay here!,The hotel is is a great location. Easy access to multiple districts by foot or by cab. Wonderful clean rooms with great amenities. Amazing service by the staff. Made the trip to Barcelona even better!  ,5,2017,04,26
13,Must Stay!,My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House prior to a cruise.  What an amazing location.  From the friendly service of the front desk to the staff during our breakfast.  The room was very well appointed.  The history of the building added to the beauty of Barcelona.  We hope to visit again and will definitely stay here again.,5,2017,04,26
13,Excellent hotel!,"My husband and I spent the week before Easter at this hotel. It is everything people say and more! The hotel is beautiful, it's elegant yet comfortable. If the weather cooperates you can have drinks outside in the garden. The breakfast was included and was terrific, we didn't have the need to order eggs off the menu. Yes, the rooms aren't huge but ours was quite functional. The shower closet is something we've never encountered before!

The best part of this hotel is the staff. They go out of their way to assist. From the Cava at check-in to the check-out, everyone is superb. We decided to eat in the restaurant our last night but didn't have a reservation. The staff took care of us and found us a table. They should all be commended.",5,2017,04,24
13,Simply not 5 star,"This is simply not a 5-star hotel.  The service is adequate, but simply not up to peer hotels.  For example, at the Hassler in Rome, upon check-in a front desk associate takes you to the room.  Not here.  At the Langham in London, your slippers are put out next to your bed at night. Not here.  At the Villa Sant'Andrea, every reasonable request is met without blinking twice.  Not here. 

Moreover, the rooms look worn considering the age of the hotel—dirty walls, chipped paint and uneven flooring.  Contrast that with the Savoy in Florence, where the rooms are perfectly maintained.  And, the shower in the Madras room is impossible—you have to get into it, then close the door, then turn it on. 

If I were not in Barcelona for such a short trip, I would switch hotels. ",3,2017,04,24
13,Hidden Gem in Barcelona,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this property. The fusion of classical & modern is spectacular, the location is amazing & the staff/service were delightful. We already want to go back to Barcelona & I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else! ",5,2017,04,24
13,Nice hotel but overpriced for the size of rooms,"Had a nice last minute stay here. Staff were friendly, and the terrace and bar were great. Where it fell down was the size of the rooms- for over 300 Euros we felt it was pretty cell- like. We didn't even have an external window, just one looking out onto the wall of a courtyard, which made the whole thing pretty dingey.",3,2017,04,21
13,Fantastic Place to Enjoy Barcelona,"Arriving without luggage due to weather related flight changes/reroute from the USA, two intern front desk personnel, Mark and Charles, made a world of difference and their welcome was so appreciated.  Even before checking our reservation, champagne and water and some excellent sweets were offered and enjoyed.  After the check in was completed and assurances made to get the lost bags to our room upon delivery, a tour of Cotton House was offered and accepted.  It's basically a hotel inside a museum!  Absolutely gorgeous with its spiral staircase, sitting areas, flowers and excellent ambiance.  A thorough explanation of features of the hotel room was provided by Mark when we entered our room and an offer to help in anyway possible, was made.  Everything was in proper working order and extra European adapters were provided in a super timely manner.  Breakfast both mornings was ample and excellent and nothing more needs to be ordered from the additional menu available.  Fresh squeezed orange juice, mint water and other beverages were bountiful and an excellent array of meat delicacies just added more and more pleasure to the meal. The desert table is likewise hard to resist.  
Once one of the missing bags arrived at the hotel a day later, a call was received from the desk that it was on its way up and less than 30 seconds later it was delivered!    Due to the departure time of our cruise ship, we went to the airport on Sunday morning to retrieve the other missing bag as delivery of baggage from the airport to the hotel was slow, but not the fault of Cotton House.  One can take the Aero Bus from the airport to Pl University, and then board the #12 bus which stops directly in front of Cotton House.  Talk about making it easy!   
A glass of wine on the hotel's patio prior to taking in the view from the rooftop pool area prior to leaving for dinner at Casa Alfonso, (a short 10 min walk) made Saturday evening complete.   Would we stay here again? No doubt about it as it is centrally located and the staff make this great hotel, fantastic.",5,2017,04,20
13,"A Great Stay, But Some Rough Edges","Stayed here 5 nts. (on Marriott points - Yayyy!)   First, location -- very good, on the margin between the old Gothic Quarter and the new l'Eixample business and shopping area, with good transportation connections.  Very closest Metro stop, Urquinaona (say ""ur-keen-OW-na""), two blocks away and on the main M-1 east-west Metro line with connections with other lines .  ONE LIMITATION:  Hard to find any small family-style restaurants serving trad. Catalan cuisine nearby.
Staff are WONDERFUL -- At least 5-star, and maybe 6- or 7!  Cordial and delighted to help you enjoy your visit in any way possible. I can't say enough good about them.
Excellent wi-fi -- almost as good as home.
Some rough edges with the room:  The floor drain in the shower was plugged and spread water over the bathroom floor (fixed almost immediately after reported).  The 17-inch clothes rod in the closet was inadequate for two people;  and it was Ill-secured and about to slip out of its bracket (also, lost two inches of usability due to the ironing board).  There was no toilet bowl brush -- an absolute 'must' with European-designed toilets!  Trivial, but these should not exist in as hotel that charges as much as 300-500 Euros a night for rooms.
The rerstaurant  -- BATUAR -- serves very good food -- a bit pricey, but in-line with the neighborhood .  Once again , the service is a delight -- nice people who REALLY want you to enjoy your dinner!",5,2017,04,19
13,Posh and elegant,"Very nice and elegant place,  bit expensive but nice.

Staff don't speak Catalan apparently in , only Spanish and English.

Very well decorated, very welcoming. It's a nice place to have a drink at night with friends.",5,2017,04,15
13,Great Boutique Hotel,"We absolutely loved this hotel.  We were warmly greeted upon arrival with 2 glasses of Cava and our boys with chocolates.  The building itself is amazing and all guests are given a 15 minute tour and told about its history.   Each day when we left the hotel or upon our return the staff greeted us and asked how our day was.  Breakfast was included for us as my husband is platinum with Marriott and the spread was wonderful - a typical European spread with fresh squeezed juices, coffees, meats, cheeses, breads, and 4 or 5 entrees they would cook for you.  The dining room is beautiful and a great way to start the day.  We ate in the restaurant on the day we arrived and while the tapas were a little pricey, they were absolutely delicious...as my husband says, ""You get what you pay for.""  The beds were very comfortable and there was a Nespresso machine in the room along w/ a tea kettle for teas.  We stayed in the Vichy Suite which was absolutely perfect for our family of 4.  It has a king bed and two couches that make into a bed.  It also has 1.5 baths which allowed a second bathroom for our boys.  It also has a private terrace and an amazing view of the Sagrada Familia.  We had a lovely time in Barcelona and the Cotton House definitely added our  positive experience.  We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,04,13
13,OK but seems disorganized,"Interesting story of the building but I found the staff very ""rehearsed.""  That is fine but if they have a passion for their work, which at least the bell boy did, it gets masked by the uniforms and appears insincere because of the apparent scripting.  It also seems to make them a bit unresponsive if you as for something.  They did offer us a nice drink of Cava on arrival and our room was clean and ready and the furnishings well maintained.  We had a room with a courtyard facing balcony which was very breezy and comfortable in the afternoon.  Upon arrival and departure there was no bell staff so we took our own bags.  The room was very quite.  The breakfast was uninspired and they nickle and dimed the ""free"" breakfast such that an omelette was 5 euro.  In a 450 euro room with breakfast included this was really petty.  Probably go back to the Majestic Hotel in the future or the Palace next door.  However, that balcony was very, very nice for an afternoon bottle of wine.",4,2017,04,13
13,Boutique hotel where you feel at home,"If you want a more personalized experience without all of the crowds at a bigger hotel, this is the perfect choice.  Hotel interior decorating is fabulous!  I loved sitting in the library, on the restaurant's patio, and by the pool on the roof.  Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful.  They made me feel at home.  Housekeeping did a wonderful job and visited my room twice per day to freshen it up.  Food was delicious.  They give you a tour of the hotel when you arrive.",5,2017,04,11
13,💖❤️💖historic boutique hotel in Barcelona! ,"Hello! We just left the beautiful and historic Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona! It was gorgeous and the front desk staff fabulous! We are Marriott Rewards travelers and used points to stay here. It's allot of points but we felt it was worth it. 

The young men that checked us in when we arrived Saturday night were friendly, professional and gracious hosts. 

We enjoyed the beautiful roof top pool and the outdoor patio ( although too early for them to serve food outside). We did not eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on that. The hotel restaurant atmosphere was beautiful though.   We were traveling with our teen who is a bit picky and the restaurant just didn't appeal to your typical American teenager. We did have the breakfast one morning and it was fine not overly impressive but worked for us. 

We had a corner room on the 6th floor that over looked the garden patio. It is also the same floor as the pool but not to worry this is not a loud place.   You have a view of the. I You will love this historic building down town. We walked almost everywhere but the staff easily assisted with taxi's when needed. We also used the concierge desk for tickets to sights and a dinner show. 

This is our first trip to Spain and it could easily be one of my favorite cities. Being from Connecticut I compare every city to New York. I was warned that Barcelona can be very crowded especially the week before Easter. It is no NYC at Christmas that is for sure! Of course the popular tourist spots are crowded and I would suggest getting tickets online ahead of time. If the tickets online are sold out the day you want to go and you can pick another day as you can expect at least a 2 hour wait. For example La Sagrada Famila is very crowded with tour buses and the line to get in could be a 2 hour wait. Get those tickets in advanced. And the crowds compared to NYC say Christmas? Think Rockefeller Center or 5th Ave window crowds.  Pretty crowded.  We spent a beautiful Sunday afternoon at the Parc de la Ciutadella. I would suggest grab some lunch to go and head there for the afternoon.  If you try to get food at the park there is some places but the lines are long. 

Happy and safe travels! ",5,2017,04,11
13,Almost 5* had restaurant service not let it down,"The location and the building is absolutely perfect. The decor in every room is an Instagrammer's dream. 
I was greeted by incredibly friendly reception and door staff; and they were throughout the four days. Offered champagne on arrival; very special! 

The room was perfect; again the decor was beautiful, the bed large and comfy and additions such as cotton flowers in the bathroom are a lovely touch.

My one issue came with the service in the bar, where we were told we couldn't have food (not even bar snacks) outside on the deck. For breakfast I had to ask every morning to be served, for coffee to be poured, for napkins which were missing, or a fork to be given. The staff in the bar / restaurant were not that friendly, which was a disappointment. 

The breakfast however was brilliant in terms of selection and quality; so much choice and variety. Very impressive.",4,2017,04,10
13,Luxurious Hotel with Outstanding Service,"From the moment we entered the Cotton House Hotel, we were treated like treasured guests who had come to stay in a beautifully renovated home. Our room was modern and very comfortable.  We especially appreciated the assistance of the concierges and the front desk staff.  We had breakfast and dinner twice in their restaurant, Batur, because the food and service were exceptional.",5,2017,04,08
13,Old world ambience with a modern touch,"This would be first on my list for a dinner in Barcelona.

We had dinner here one night and loved it.   From the moment you walk in the door you can't miss the amazing design effort that has gone into this hotel, though it looks like it just evolved.

The terrace was the perfect place to enjoy a pre-dinner Gin and Tonic with a great view and perfect atmosphere.  Dinner was exceptional, as the staff are extremely capable and professional.  

A great experience from start to finish...highly recommended.",5,2017,04,05
13,Loved every Minute.,"Beautiful renovated building, all the rooms are modern and spacious.  The people who work for the hotel make you fell like you are home.  The hotel is in a great location, close to the historic old town and right on the edge of the more modern area of Barcelona.  Walking distance to all the sights.",5,2017,04,05
13,Luxurious Connection with the Past,"We walked into the hotel and were greeted promptly and offered Champagne and a sweet. I noticed a familiar bouquet from my childhood on the counter - Cotton Stems. 
My father was a cotton farmer in Missouri in the 1940s - 1950s. He passed just a year ago, and the bouquet brought back good memories, as did the order/manifests for cotton goods on display in the dining area from 1951. My father's cotton could've made it here, to be stitched into shirts by the tailors who worked their trade here.
The concierge was knowledgeable about the area and mapped out a nice walk in the Gothic Quarter, with a quick detour for a couple Antoni Gaudi buildings.
The meals were very good and wait staff was very attentive but discrete.  
Our room was fifth floor facing the street and was bright, airy, and quiet.
While we did not arrange the bespoke shirt service, a nice optional service, the all- around experience was pleasurable. 
When we are in Barcelona again, we'll stay here. Not only as an homage to my dad, but because they are truly hospitable.
Rick and Carol Willis",5,2017,04,05
13,A charming and modern hotel in city center,"We've spent three days in Barcelona and did enjoy the hotel. It s very comfortable, the staff is welcoming and friendly, the food is good (we had lunch when we arrived). It has a charming restaurant with a micro-museum explaining the production of the cotton - and the whole building inside is decorated to illustrate the art of making the cotton and the cotton fabric. The location is central.
We liked this place a lot and would certainly return.",5,2017,04,04
13,Fantastic boutique Luxury hotel.,"We stayed here for 4 night and we enjoyed it very much.  The staff and very friendly, the location is good.
We have been to Barcelona few times in the last several years and this is by far the best hotel we stayed at.",5,2017,04,03
13,Exceptional in Barcelona,"This hotel is a part of the Autograph Collection in the Marriott world.  
This is a truly exceptional property.  It's boutique in size with ultra-sophisticated room.  Rooms are bright, airy and very well appointed.  
     This hotel is housed in the building that was originally the Cotton Association of Spain, prior to that it belonged to a family from the cotton industry.
     The lobby is elegant and features reception treats throughout the day.  The bar is old-world with imaginative drinks, comfortable seating arrangements and outstanding servers.
   The hotel's restaurant features an outstanding Catalonian influenced menu.  Well developed pre-fixe menus give the opportunity to sample talented preparation of regional cuisine.
   The hotel is in close walking distance to the Ramblas, shopping, theater, and world class dining.
    In short, it's an outstanding property, small and comfortable, giant in a cosmopolitan world.",5,2017,03,31
13,Great Location and BEAUTIFUL Property,"I loved this property, the history and decor was on point to the theme they were aiming for. The staff was all properly dressed with uniform and the service was amazing. Reyes, Olga, Alex the bartender, and Ivanka from concierge stood out quite a bit during our time here. Reyes is always smiling and greeted us every time as we walk into the hotel. Olga really made sure I was very satisfied with my excursion and went out of her way to make sure I was happy with the results. Alex, amazing and attentive bartender and so friendly recommending all the things and places to eat and see. Ivanka (I think that's her name) she was part of concierge and she really knows her stuff about Barcelona and was always happy to help plan out the day for you. The hotel was so central to everything, we debated about moving over to the W for two nights, but decided to stay based on the property and the staff and how well they have treated us. I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming into Barcelona!",5,2017,03,30
13,Perfect Home Base!,"My teenage daughter and her friend loved that they could walk everywhere!  Their room and our room were both Madras rooms.  The two rooms were not identical.  We had a more traditional bathroom with two sinks.  Their sink was in the hall and they had a shower room, which they could get all wet.  It was a perfect home base, centrally-located near all the sights.  There are good restaurants nearby.",5,2017,03,29
13,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL BUT NEED TO BE CAREFUL!!,"My husband and I as well as 7 of his friends were in Barcelona to run the Barcelona Marathon. We were 8 couples. My husband booked 8 rooms at Cotton House for our  friends as well as us. My husband had actually stayed at Cotton House 3 weeks prior to our stay for a business trip. When he stayed there he asked for a room facing the courtyard for the upcoming Marathon stay and the receptionist at the time said that that they would give us one. However when we checked in for the Marathon stay we were not happy with our room. It was tiny and looked onto a wall. We immediately went down to reception and complained. We were thankfully given another room that was incomparable to the original room. 4 of the couples were given rooms facing the courtyard and we all arrived more or less the same time. So we were not impressed. 

Two out of the 4 days we were there our room had not been done by 15h30. When I saw this I called housekeeping to tell them and I then went out and told my husband who at the time was in the hotel lounge with his friends not to rush to the room. After a while he went to our room. He found the door ajar as the maid was still making up our room. As he entered the room he asked the maid when she will be done. She could not answer him as her mouth was full of the Muesli that he had especially bought to eat on the morning of the race. Well suffice to say that was the end of the Muesli!! What else was the maid helping herself to??!! Rather disconcerting to say the least. My husband immediately went downstairs firstly to say that his room had not been done by 15h30 and that the maid was eating his Muesli.
Another issue we found was that the hotel has a policy for breakfast that if you eat there for 3 or more mornings the cost is 18 Euros per person but if you eat there only one morning then it is 33 Euros per person. As mentioned above we had booked 8 rooms for 4 nights. My husband asked reception if on our last morning there we can all eat, which was 16 of us, for 18 Euros per person as a special favour in light of how many rooms we had taken for 4 nights. He was told by the lady at reception ""It does not work like that"" I would have imagined after the business we had given them and my husband's second stay there in 3 weeks as well as the Muesli episode it would have been their pleasure!! We had also spent a fortune on pre dinner drinks every night in hotel lounge. We feel this was was unreasonable.
Other than this the hotel is beautiful, the fragrance they put through their air vents in the public areas is magnificent. The hotel is in a good location. Wi Fi is very fast. As for the breakfast we can not vouch for that!!",3,2017,03,29
13,Great well-located hotel with plenty of character,"If you are looking for an interesting boutique hotel with a central location, welcoming staff, and interesting interiors, you should take a look at the Cotton House Hotel.  We were greeted warmly at check in, and the staff throughout the hotel was helpful during our entire stay.  We had a room on the 6th floor in the back from which we could glimpse (and I mean glimpse) the Mediterranean, but more importantly, the room was very quiet and looked out over the terrace and a city scene.  It was a decent size for a European city hotel.  The public spaces are beautiful.  The restaurant alone offers different atmospheres for seating ranging from an outdoor patio for drinks to warm and clubby or light and airy for breakfast.  We had both drinks and breakfast in these spaces and enjoyed it every time.  Breakfast itself is copious and very good.  Cured meats, pastries, cakes, salad, breads, fruit, yogurt, egg sandwiches etc as part of the buffet.  Other public spaces include a stunning library/sitting area where I believe you can have drinks as well and two gorgeous staircases.

The location was perfect for us.  We like to walk, and walked to everything from La Sagrada Familia to el Born to the port to Mont Juic. All our restaurants for dinner were about a 20 minute walk whether that was by the Picasso museum or in the Eixample area.  There is a metro stop close by as well.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to friends who are looking for this type of hotel experience.",5,2017,03,29
13,Dinner,"Wonderful dinner, cool hotel.  We did not stay at this hotel but we had dinner there.
The location is great, the feel of the hotel is very special
The bar had quite a buzz and the outdoor space was lovely.
Pool on top too!",5,2017,03,27
13,Impressive boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"We stayed here for two nights at the beginning of a week vacation on the Mediterranean. The hotel was unique and well appointed, located in easy walking distance to Las Ramblas. The front desk personnel were efficient and friendly and offered many good suggestions for restaurants in the area. We had breakfast in the restaurant at the hotel, which was bountiful and delicious. Highly recommend!",5,2017,03,25
13,Classy Barcelona Hotel!,"Really loved our brief stay at Cotton House. To echo other guests, we were greeted warmly by both the front desk and the bell staff. Most appreciated after the overnight flight from U.S. The hotel is a beautiful property and the room was most spacious, overlooking a courtyard. Enjoyed the outdoor patio for a drink, before embarking for an evening on The Ramblas. Bar staff couldn't be nicer. We'll be back someday!!",5,2017,03,22
13,Loved it,Spent one night at the Cotton House a couple of weeks ago upon arrival in Barcelona with family.  Beautiful boutique hotel in a great location.  Staff were wonderful - special mention goes to Anna at the concierge desk who was of great help in securing great seats to the Barca - PSG match on short notice!  Highly recommend.,5,2017,03,21
13,Great hotel; loved this hotel; best staff.,"Upon arrival we were warmly greeted with Cava and tiramisu.  The hotel is a boutique hotel in an historic building and a great location--close enough to walk to sites and close to the Metro. The staff can't do enough for you.  The Front Desk staff, Carles and Sofia, went out of their way to greet us each time we entered the hotel; were helpful with suggestions; and provided us a tour of the historic building.  The restaurant was lovely and each day Judith would ensure we had everything we wanted. The Concierge were very helpful in providing directions, maps and suggestions--Avantika, Daphne, Sabrina, and Anna.  The doorman--Reyes--was always there with a smile.  Thank you to everyone for making our stay so enjoyable and memorable. Would recommend this hotel very highly.",5,2017,03,20
13,Cash stolen from houskeeping,"I had $300 in cash left in an envelope inside of my backpack (I left this in my room for the entire time I stayed in Barcelona). The Monday that I had checked in around 2 pm I heard a ton of noise in the hall. I peeped through the eye hole and noticed that two staff members were running up and down the hallway and going into multiple rooms on the floor. I first thought this was very strange but assumed it was a procedure. Then I heard a door bell and I was getting up to answer the door a staff member uses his key and opens the door. At first when he sees me he looked startled and flustered. He then turned around got two water bottles and handed them to me and shut the door very quickly. 

The next strange incident happened on Wednesday around 4 pm.  I came back to the hotel. The house keeping staff was outside of our room (a woman) but said our room was ready. She seemed startled but moved her cart aside so we could enter the room. After a few minutes of being in our room a housekeeping member (a man whom I did not see in the hall) knocked on our door and asked if everything was okay. I thought nothing of it at the time but did think it was strange how he asked us immediately after we got into the room. 

I got to the airport and took out my envelope and noticed that the $300 in cash was missing. I have since called the hotel and they did admit to a large amount of foot traffic on the hotel floors due to a ""market week"" they had in their hotel. I have no idea what this entails but they said that was the reason why staff members were entering the hotel rooms (they claim that the staff members were delivering invitations to those guests) but why was my room included in this if I wasn't a guest of ""market week""? 

Would not stay here again. Aside from this incident, the room was not as it was advertised, very small and the bathroom had very bad drainage issues. The pool was temporarily closed for the four nights I stayed in the hotel- the staff did not let me know via email that the pool would be closed for three days due to maintenance.",1,2017,03,20
13,Loved this hotel! Would go back for sure.,"We found this hotel to be charming in EVERY way, from the greeting at the front desk (with a complimentary glass of 'cava') to the friendly staff (front desk, restaurant , housekeeping, each and every one we encountered), to the stunning, creative decorating scheme. The public rooms are beautifully conceived. Our bedroom facing the rear with a balcony, on an upper floor, was smaller than expected but perfect otherwise.  We would definitely recommend a rear facing room if you plan to open the windows (we did almost the entire time due to mild weather). Gran Via is an extremely busy avenue, and thus there's lots of traffic noise.

Very conveniently located five blocks from Placa de Catalunya.  Coming in on the fast, inexpensive airport bus was a breeze.

Didn't have breakfast in their restaurant, found a small place around the corner with great coffee and reasonable prices. However, had the tapa tasting menu for two one night, a sensory delight.",5,2017,03,19
13,Will not stay anywhere else,"I am so surprised I was as delighted as I am with this hotel.  Fantastic staff, property and easy to get everywhere...Metro, busses, heart of town is just a few blocks walk.  As someone else said, ""quite Elegance"" for sure.  If you enjoy 5 star boutique accommodations, you like this for sure. I travel a lot and used Marriot points which was a double bonus.  Was here with my daughter and felt super safe and everyone from concierge, waiters, front desk, etc was great.",5,2017,03,19
13,Beautiful hotel in great location ,"Historic hotel, very beautiful, staff extremely friendly, in a great location. Easy to walk to sites and restaurants.  It's also nice that it's a Marriott hotel see you get your points. I would highly recommend this hotel. It will make your stay in Barcelona one to remember.",5,2017,03,18
13,Quiet Elegance and exceptional welcome,"We were intrigued about what it would be like to stay at a house once the home of Gaudi and later of the Cotton merchants of Barcelona. Nothing compares with the exceptional hospitality, quiet elegances and location of this hotel! Despite its relative small rooms, we had all we needed for a 5*plus premier hotel. We even had a thoughtful parting gift on the dashboard ✨",5,2017,03,18
13,Nice and welcoming hotel ,"When you walk inside and you start to smell the nice parfum of the hotel, you already know that you will enjoy your stay.
The team of the welcome desk always smile and offer you a welcome drink. In the lobby the doorman will help you to carry your luggage.
Finally the room will be bright clean and quite big (coton room). The breakfast is very nice and complete (fruits, bread, cheese, yogurt, ham and sweets). Waitresses and waiters are always checking on you see if you need anything.

13,What a beautiful hotel!,"We stayed at the hotel for two wonderful nights. The staff was welcoming, efficient and very knowledgeable. The rooms were lovely. The lobby and restaurant area were beautiful. The breakfast is not to be missed. Also, the outdoor space outside the breakfast area is charming and comfortable. The location was perfect. Close to tourist attractions eithe by walking or metro. I highly recommend this beautiful hotel and it's excellent and professional staff!",5,2017,03,17
13,An absolute gem! ,"From the moment we walked in until we checked out three days later, we loved this hotel! We were given a brief tour and history of this beautiful space. The staff was very friendly and the concierge was knowledgeable. 

As platinum members we stayed in a beautiful suite with simple but elegant decor. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. The breakfast was filled with a variety of healthy juices, yogurts and wonderful pastries!

The hotel's location was excellent. We walked to the Gothic Quarter, the Port and to dinner. 

I highly recommend the Cotton House. It made for a fabulous place to stay in the amazing city of Barcelona! ",5,2017,03,16
13,"Beautiful renovation, excellent location and attentive staff!","We had a great room with a balcony facing the courtyard, just down the hall from the rooftop pool. The renovation work and the interior is spectacular with great attention to detail. You really feel like you are in a special one of a kind place.",5,2017,03,16
13,99% perfect,"It has been a long time since I effused about a hotel.  This is the one.  Stylish, smallish, great bar, beautiful terrace, small modern rooms and bathrooms, attentive, almost perfect service (oops, was planning a shopping excursion with front desk and the hotel person forgot to tell me-and I guess I should have known-that shops all 12-3), very small roof-top pool, very small but very clean and well-equipped gym.  
The vibe is great, not too young, not too old.  Love.  

The negative 1%: see above + carpet on 4th floor hall very stained.

NB: for the operator, dial 9, not 0",5,2017,03,16
13,Nice Hotel with great Staff,"We stayed at this hotel for a week in March, 2017. The location of the hotel is central and perfect for restaurants, train stations etc. The hotel staff is always there to help you with a smile.

13,"Three & 1/2 days, no 4&1/2 days in Barcelona ","Thanks to the impending snow storm on the East coast, Newark, we get to extend our first trip to Barcelona. No thanks to the airlines about cancelling our flights and not making any effort to help! 
But that's not what I'm reviewing today! The Cotton House, totally surpassed our expectations! The staff were excellent very well managed and trained. First class service, food, room with excellent bedding!  Beautiful outdoor courtyard for drinks, after a full day of seeing the sights.
You only live once, splurge or use all of your Marriott points, this place is awesome, great location, close walking access to restaurants,shopping, and many attractions. Very helpful staff to help make reservations, buy tickets ,provide maps, what ever you may like.",5,2017,03,14
13,A secret Find,"We stayed at this hotel for a second trip to the Barcelona Marathon because we had such an incredible stay last year. 
We were not disappointed,in fact it was better then our expectation!
First the location is perfect,bus stop out front,very short walk to many restaurants and shopping. The rooms are boutique size but quiet, well appointed and very comfortable, very hip. 
The whole feeling of the hotel is a private club.The dining room and breakfast are first class and the lounge area a fabulous respite after a long day out.
The staff is what makes this hotel special,from the greeting from Reyes who is helpful, happy and offering, water, pastry and maps.The unbelievable Gossypium Team who is a young, knowledgeable concierge team that works exceptionally hard to make your visit special. Especially Avantika who is a great addition to this hotel.They very kindly left best wishes in our room for the marathon. These special touches makes this a hotel we will return to!",5,2017,03,13
13,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful stay","Cotton House Hotel is a lovely, immaculately-kept hotel outside of the old town bustle of Barcelona.  Great service, delicious breakfast (among the best I've ever had in a hotel) and an excellent quiet location.  The building itself is amazing and the decor is both bold and understated at the same time.  My only complaint is that it was a little hard to get the attention of the restaurant staff if we needed anything, though this was an issue at many places we ate and so I suspect there may simply be different norms about this.",5,2017,03,12
13,"Great service, beautiful hotel",We stayed at this beautiful hotel during our recent Barcelona visit.  The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly.  We had a very short stay in the city and wished to make the most of it.  Their recommendation of the hop on and off tour bus was spot on and we were able to purchase tickets at the hotel.  The concierge explained how the buses worked and where to catch them.  The daily buffet breakfast is amazing!  Such a variety and the restaurant area was beautiful.  Can't wait to go back and visit again.  Cotton House will be where we stay again.,5,2017,03,07
13,Two thumbs up!,"Stayed at the hotel for a week with my wife while visiting Barcelona last month.  Most enjoyable stay!  Staff was most friendly and helpful.  Even gave us the tour of the hotel while waiting for our room to get ready (first ever hotel tour for me).  Rooms are clean and modern.  Loved the spiral staircase.  Hotel is very conveniently located, close to major streets and attractions, and we walked to most places.  Hope to go back to Barcelona someday, and if we do, would love to stay at the Cotton House again.",5,2017,03,06
13,SERVICE WAS TOP NOTCH,"Location was great as it was a few blocks to the main city area. At check in, we were greeted by a receptionist and he assisted us with our bags which we were grateful of and he also managed to get a connecting room which was wonderful. 

The bed was amazingly comfortable and the room was spectacular and the bathroom was also very clean and lovely. Have to say the bed was abit soft for my liking but overall everything else was great. 

Breakfast was spectacular and the way it was carefully arranged accordingly. Hot food has be to paid but I did enjoyed the other food and they also have a big table just for desserts, YES PLEASE! And the service was top notch as they never fail to greet us or ask for coffee or tea!

Service was also excellent as we were greeted daily Reyes everyday and he made a very good impression when we first arrived and at the end of the stay, he was also also there to say goodbye. MS Singh was also kind enough to follow up on a situation of ours which we were very thankful of. 

Would definitely come back when the opportunity arises.Thank you for making our stay amazing!",5,2017,03,06
13,"Just Marvelous, highly recommended ","My wife and I and our two kids stayed here 2 nights whilst in Barca to watch FCB play. From the moment we arrived to the early morning packed breakfasts on departure the staff couldn't have been lovelier. 
The hotel is beautiful and in a great position. I would also recommend eating in the hotel restaurant. 
We stayed in both a regular room and the Presidential Suite. Both were well appointed and very comfortable. ",5,2017,03,06
13,Wonderful Hotel in a Beautiful location,The staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant. The room was wonderful and the outside bar area was lovely. The location was perfect! The room although a little  tight had the most amazing walk in closet and a wonderful shower. The bed was amazing and I must say I have never slept better.,5,2017,03,06
13,Lap of Luxury,"I have life-time platinum status with Marriott and wholeheartedly recommend this hotel. 

That said, let me set expectations on room size - adequate. Everything else - superb! We had an Egyptian Cotton Corner room (supposedly a bit larger). As an American, I'm spoiled by largess (cars, houses, bathrooms, etc.) - hence, the room size didn't quite align with the price. Nevertheless, it was a great hotel.

Service was top notch. The fit and finish of the hotel was excellent. It is a wonderfully ornate hotel. Not modern at all, and uniquely different.  All the pictures confirm that.

I place a premium on comfort and rest (after a long day of touring and walking), and the Cotton House did NOT disappoint.  The beds are some of the best I've ever slept on. The rooms are very comfortable (but thank goodness for Netflix because there are only 4 English channels on the television - when is that going to change?)

The staff was top-notch, as were their coordinated uniforms. The entire hotel blanketed you in warmth and friendliness.  Breakfast was included (hot items were extra) and the variety was abundant.

The location of the hotel is very good, as well.

The true test of any stay is the answer to this: Would you stay there again? Undoubtedly, ""Yes"" - and without any hesitation.",5,2017,03,05
13,So beautiful,Amazing place strongly recommend for coffee launch or more. We found the place in cntraveller and we fall in love. Service was outstanding. Beautiful decoration and also nice location near by P Garcia,5,2017,03,04
13,Pre cruise days in Barcelona,The Cotton House Hotel is very interesting in former Cotton Business.  The building has been made into a boutique Hotel with the Marriott Autograph Collection.   We were offered a tour of the hotel which was rich in history and many beautiful areas they have preserved.  Close to La Rambla walking street and many other historic sights.,5,2017,03,02
13,Excellent,"Had a work conference at the hotel back in November. It was a great venue, with buckets of character. The room was lovely and clean. The restaurant good for breakfast & dinner. Couldn't get a better central location.",5,2017,03,01
13,"Cotton House Hotel, Barcelona Spain",Very interesting and beautiful setting for this hotel.  The building was originally a family residence during the textile manufacturing era of the 1800's.  It has been renovated into a modern hotel while preserving important architectural history such as original wood flooring and marble accents.  The staff were wonderful and wanted to ensure our stay was outstanding.  The concierge was very accommodating. It is immaculate and the shower and tub is delightful.,5,2017,02,26
13,Like it a lot,"Very good greeting at reception. Organised and ready for me. Took very little time . Was upgrading to a supper room. Eat in the hotel restaurant.Artichoke soup followed by Octopus, very enjoyable. The bar area really very pleasant. Will have cigar and coffee on the loverly terrace. 
Certainly would recommend this hotel.",4,2017,02,23
13,Unique and very lovely,A very lovely and historic building restored to preserve its history. Great location close to placa catalunya.  Really enjoyed our stay and the excellent staff who took time to share the history of the building and were thoughtful and attentive.  Walking distance to la rambla and to metro.,5,2017,02,20
13,"Club atmosphere, distinct style, fantastic service!","We really enjoyed our stay at the Cotton House. It feels more like a Club House, has all the necessary amenities of a luxury hotel, and most importantly, the staff was super friendly! As a Platinum member we got upgraded in a room on the top floor with a nice view. This floor must have been added recently, and while everything seemed to be quite new, it has not had the charm of the other parts of the hotel. The bar and library on the first floor were very cosy and the breakfast excellent, offering nice selection of freshly squeezed juices and a wonderful selection of crispy breads and parties. The fitness room was tiny ( 9 m2?) offering two machines, as was the outdoor rooftop pool.",4,2017,02,19
13,Beautiful and VERY stylish though not always on the mark.,"The hotel is very attractive and oh so stylish. The staff was very attentive but perhaps a bit too eager. At times it felt like they were hovering, ready to pounce rather than ready to offer assistance. The room was a bit on the small size though everything worked OK.",4,2017,02,14
13,Luxury at its best!,"We stayed at the Cotton House back in October 2016 for our wedding anniversary. This was absolutely one of the top 5 hotels (if not #1) that we've ever been to. The decor is unbelievable - especially the famous staircase!. As Marriott Platinum staying on points, we were lucky to be upgraded to a larger room - the Cotton Room. I had hoped for a suite but that was probably too much to as for! We also received the complimentary breakfast buffet as this hotel does not have a typical Concierge lounge. There's no need to upgrade to the hot breakfast - you get plenty to eat with the buffet! So many great meats, cheeses, breads, fruit, yogurt, etc. They'll even make you a latte, café au lait - whatever you want! Other tips for Platinum guests staying on points - book your room well in advance - they only allocate a few rooms for ""points people"". Other highlights of our stay included the young concierge intern, Nick. We don't normally use the hotel concierge desk but Nick (and the others) were so helpful in making reservations for us at the local sights and restaurants and printing off tickets. We ended up eating dinner at Batuar 3 times during our stay due to some unforeseen rainy weather. We never got tired of the patatas bravas, Jamón ibérico (ham) or the Cava! One downside was that they didn't open the outdoor patio for dining when it got a little cooler outside. The location of the hotel is very convenient ... walking distance to all the key sights. This was a dream vacation and we would love to return one day. Thank you to all the staff for making this a fantastic stay!!!",5,2017,02,14
13,I Highly recommend this hotel,"From the moment we went thru the door until the moment we departed, from the doorman, to the check in to the concierges every encounter with the staff was gracious, warm and professional. The public areas are interesting and unique. This does not come across as part of a large chain at all. It is more of a charming boutique hotel.",5,2017,02,13
13,Amazing weekend,"Cotton House will take you back into the 19th Century with everything you need from the 21st. 
As soon as you step in, you can tell the big investment and the great job the architect made in this property. 
Lighting, decoration, smell are just a few things to note.
The impecable service from the friendly staff made our stay perfect.
Food quality and comfort of the bed are the top two highlights.
Special mention to Jandro and Angelo who with their passion enhance the luxury feeling.",5,2017,02,12
13,They made my stay awesome,The hotel is worth every penny and was better than the higher priced luxury hotels.  You are close to everything and have great places to eat very close.  Sergi was great.  Actually EVERY one was extremely nice and accommodating.,5,2017,02,11
13,VERY BAD,"We are almost done with our stay at Cotton House and look forward to the next hotel. We were randomly ""double upgraded"" to a room upon our arrival, this room is on the second floor above the restaurant with a balcony that was directly above the restaurant terrace. They play music at a blaring level from 10am until 1:30am every night, it makes sleep impossible. It may be the room location, but the volume level is certainly heard with any balcony facing the terrace. We finally called to see if volume could be lowered with no luck, this makes sleep impossible in addition to any nap that may be required due to lack of sleep as the music blares for the vast majority of the day. This is our 5th day here and we are considering just booking a third hotel so that we can stop having to hear the music at all times. The room is cute, but it's impossible to sleep here. Do not even consider booking, I can't imagine what our room was supposed to be like before the ""double upgrade"". As a side note, we are used to living in a very loud city and this is not the same thing. If you like to have even the smallest amount of sleep on vacation, you won't get that here. Be certain to drink at least a bottle of cava before bed each night so that sleep is a possibility. We are also using a sound app on our phone to try and decrease the restaurant sound, but it's like we are inside a club while laying in bed. Disgusting to treat guests in this way, do not stay here.",1,2017,02,08
13,Comfortable accommodations in a beautiful building in a great location ,"The service was very good, so compliments to the staff. Our stay was comfortable. We had the Madras room with a window overlooking Gran Via. The common areas are beautiful. The breakfast package was good with fresh juices, coffee, tea, pastries, eggs, waffles, pancakes, mini sandwiches, meats, cheeses, fruit, etc. The hotel could do a better job with general maintenence and upkeep, e.g., there was staining in the carpeting in the public area on our floor as well as other places etc. A 5 star boutique hotel ought to be near perfect. In addition,  one morning, repair work was done just outside the room; however, this should have been scheduled for the afternoon or when the rooms in the area are unoccupied. The hotel is in a good location for exploring the city by foot or metro. The neighborhood is safe and upscale. There are supermercats, restaurants, bars, pastry shops etc nearby. Definitely have a cocktail at the hotel bar, which offers a large selection of drinks. The cocktails we ordered from the menu were beautiful and tasty. Overall, a good stay. ",4,2017,02,05
13,"Extraordinary hotel and service, in the middle of Barcelona!","We loved every single thing about this hotel! From the moment we entered and were offered waters and cava and greeted so warmly, we were thrilled with our hotel choice.  Every staff member, from the bell hops, to the front desk, to the ""gossipysium"", to the restaurant staff was extremely helpful, pleasant, and friendly.  Our room was beautifully decorated in a simple, warm style.  Great thought was put into the comfort and ease that was considered in it's design. We had a long bench and a beautiful leather chair in our room for additional seating.  The sink, toilet, and shower are all in three separate rooms, allowing for much more efficient preparations for the day and for sleep...no waiting around for the bathroom!  We stayed in a Cotton Room, and had a gorgeous view of the sea from afar, and of the neighborhood, up close.  We could see balconies of the local people living life and the beautiful courtyard restaurant seating of the hotel.  The sunrise from our balcony was spectacular!  The bed was one of the most comfortable that I have ever slept in.  Seriously, stay here. Very grateful to have found such a gem.",5,2017,01,31
13,Watch this space!,"This place has a unique charm like no other.....who ever redesigned the hotel deserves a nobel prize if there were such a thing for interior decorating. The public rooms are spectacular. The staff are impeccably professional and extremely inviting....the bar is fantastic (Best Nigroins) and it wouldn't surprise me if this hotel features in boutique hotels of the world.....(hopefully there is such a book) The reason I didn't rate this property as excellent is whilst the rooms were beautifully designed, they are tipping the smaller end of the scale vs price.....bathrooms are integrated into the entrance which is a tricky challenge for any designer but I'd do things differently.....showers need non slip floors! Thats a law suit waiting to happen (Hope the management see this) Beds are mind-blowing......I would have been tempted to steal one if it didn't look so obvious walking out the front door! Will definitely return.....And if you like the Art Deco 20's sort of feel.....stay there.....(Make sure breakfast is included it's expensive otherwise)......",4,2017,01,27
13,Couldn't be better ,"Super friendly staff and very tasteful interior. The breakfast is just 👌👌👌and relatively good location, about 5-6 min to the subway and really near the casa batllo and casa mila. They are doing everything extra better, such as providing twice room services per day and offer you a tour in the house about the history of the hotel",5,2017,01,27
13,"Lovely hotel, great staff, great location","We stayed in the Taffeta Suite, which was really lovely. It has a view of the Gran Via outside, and is right near the lift, but yet it was so quiet, we slept in both mornings for way longer than we had meant to! The bed was so comfortable and the suite really well appointed. Lovely bathroom with delicious Ortigia products. 
The welcome and service from the staff was excellent, from speedy check-in and check-out, to helping us to get a dinner reservation somewhere that we were told by friends it would be impossible to get one at short notice! The lounge area, breakfast room and bar are beautifully decorated and so relaxing, but with a cool atmosphere.
My husband used the gym which is small but has everything you need from a hotel gym. 
Location-wise, the Cotton House is away from the hustle and bustle of La Rambla etc, but within easy walking distance, so we walked everywhere.
We really enjoyed our stay at the Cotton House and would definitely return next time we come to Barcelona.",5,2017,01,26
13,Gorgeous property and great staff. Great location.,"This historical building is beautiful and the designer they hired did a stunning job with the updates.  The library, atelier and bar/restaurant are gorgeous.  And the staircase is a masterpiece.  I just returned after a 2-night stay for a birthday trip and enjoyed everything about this hotel.  The staff were so welcoming and we had great service throughout.  They really went out of their way to help my friend celebrate her birthday. We were upgraded to a Cotton room and enjoyed the balcony.  The rooms are small, but the beds are very comfortable and the finishes are very nice.  We enjoyed the continental breakfast in the beautiful restaurant each morning (included for Gold/Platinum members).  The great location allowed us to easily walk to the Gothic quarter, El Born, and Eixample.  Two nights at this hotel was not enough.  I will be back.",5,2017,01,23
13,Beautiful hotel with great staff.,"This hotel is really beautiful on the inside and smells great (a weird thing to focus on, but it really did smell wonderful!). The room was really well decorated, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a great shower and tub.  The staff at the concierge was very helpful with restaurant recommendations.  Location wise, we were able to walk to almost everything we wanted to see in Barcelona. I would absolutely go back.",5,2017,01,22
13,Pampered Stay!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House last week as we ended our 3 week European adventure.  It was the perfect way to end our trip!  The hotel is a beautiful blend of modern and traditional.  The renovation of the building was hip, elegant, classy and timeless.  The location was perfect for us as it was not in any hectic tourist areas but only short walk away from everything.  There are many beautiful well located hotels but what made our stay the best at the Cotton House was the staff!! From our arrival being greeted by Jandro and team with a class of Cava and a sweet bite all the way to leaving early in the morning the day of our departure by two smiling cheerful faces.  The entire concierge team when out of their way to help guide us and were always a joy to talk to. The bar and restaurant staff all have passion for what they do and want to do whatever they can to please you and make your time with them the very best.  The service is excellent and they can't do enough for you.  If you have the chance to be treated by Alex, Nicholas, Jonathan or Nuri enjoy!! They are knowledgeable, professional, and entertaining. The best staff ever!!  We look forward to our next visit to the Cotton House!!",5,2017,01,22
13,Excellent stylish and friendly hotel in good location,"We had the Otoman suite which was excellent. Despite being at the front of the property and on a low floor there was no problem with noise. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent (though for us the hot options were an extra cost). We really enjoyed our stay.

The hotel is in a good location for all the sites (Gaudi etc.). We would definitely return.",5,2017,01,22
13,"""Stunning hotel in great location""","The hotel is beautiful, cozy and situated in a great part of the city, especially if you like to walk. Every member of the staff we met was courteous and eager to assist us in any way possible, but Reyes and Nuri both went out of their way to make our stay memorable. We would not hesitate to stay here again. Just lovely!",5,2017,01,20
13,Great hotel and superb service,"Beautiful hotel, centrally located, with superb staff.   Outstanding service.  An A+ 

hotel with perfect service.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona. Staff was very helpful with tours and tips.",5,2017,01,18
13,Classy hotel,"My husband and I decided to change things up and chose this hotel in the Eiample area of Barcelona since we had stayed in the Bari Gothic area on our last visit to Barcelona. It is a beautifully decorated hotel in a very safe location, with a roof top pool, bar and restaurant with inside or outside seating, onsite tailor, and easy access to public transportation (metro or bus).  We took the Aerobus to Placa Catalunya and it was a 5 minute walk to the hotel.  We walked to several good restaurants, great shops, Sagrada Familia, Las Ramlas, etc. We only used a taxi to go to the Magic Fountains and to the cruise port, and it was reasonable. The concierge were very helpful with directions, taxis, reservations, etc. we highly recommend it and hope to return there again.",5,2017,01,14
13,Fabulous Hotel,"The experience at this hotel was amazing! As I stepped into this hotel to check-in, a glass of champagne was offered to my daughter and myself. The front desk was efficient and so welcoming. The room was beautiful and yes the cotton sheets were wonderful. The fragrance that permeates the hotel is fabulous..makes you want to just stay in the hotel and not leave.
This boutique hotel is so conveniently located that you can walk to many great shopping, sights, and restaurants. But, the great asset of this hotel is the staff. Many interns from all over the world who are personable and caring. The concierge staff was great especially, Faisal Siddiqui, who was patient with us and provided us with many great restaurant suggestions and assisted us with tour reservations.
The library was a wonderful respite from the day's activities. We had tea and drinks in the evening and Mavie Veliz was wonderful. She ensured we had some tasty bites with our drinks and always ensured we were comfortable.
I was remiss in not obtaining the reception desk staff's name, because they all were so fabulous. Note to manager: We checked in on Jan 2,2017 about 11 am..The staff was efficient and very welcoming. We travel alot and stay in Marriott Hotels, this is the best Autograph I have stayed at!",5,2017,01,13
13,"Great location, felt at home","This hotel is like no other. The experience has been excellent as well as the service. The rooms are kept very clean and the staff is right there for when you need. The hotel decoration is amazing I really loved it.  The restaurant El Batuar is cosy, the food is good however I would add a littlw bit more variety. The breakfast is absolutely delicious and has home made bakery which I really liked. We travelled with our pet and we had a bed for her and bowls for food. The hotel ammenities were fine. The only thing that I would say is that the room Up to Cotton are a bit small, but it felt really cosy. Totally recommend. ",5,2017,01,13
13,Nicest Hotel We've Ever Visited,"My wife and I are in the middle of a three night stay at the Cotton House and are enjoying it so much that I had to write a brief review. The service is absolutely impeccable. The building is stylish with incredible attention to every design detail. The rooms are beautiful, quiet, and full of amenities. The beds are some of the most comfortable I've ever stayed on. Small and unimportant detail - everyone who works here is so beautiful! If you're looking to treat yourself to a luxury stay in a beautiful city, the Cotton House is hard to beat. Simply among the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at.",5,2017,01,06
13,Great experience!,"We were excellently treated since we stepped into the hotel. The staff was very caring. 
We enjoyed a delightful dinner. We recommend you to order hot dishes for breakfast. They were incredible. We slept in the 'Otoman Suite' and we found it extraordinary. 
With no doubt we will repeat the experience if we go back to Barcelona.",5,2017,01,06
13,Luxury in the heart of Barcelona,"This is a wonderful boutique hotel centrally located in Barcelona close to most everything. The staff, everyone from the front desk to the engineers, are truly there to make sure your stay is as pleasant as they can make it. One of the best staff experiences I have ever experienced. Be sure to take advantage of the concierge service which is first class. We booked two tours through them as well as requesting information on other attractions. They are knowledgeable and make it very easy especially for the Sagrada Familia and Park Guell tours. The rooms are modern, nicely furnished with lux linen and are very quite. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have slept on in quite awhile (why is everyone going ultra-firm?) which was a nice surprise. It is an absolutely lovely hotel with very modern amenities yet still keeps it's old world charm. 

There is a roof top pool deck with a view that is open year round, perfect for a nightcap. (The pool is a little chilly in the winter but the view is great!)",5,2017,01,04
13,Fabulous,"The Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona is positively fantastic.  Boutique-y, charming, excellent service, wonderful bar and restaurant, lovely lobby/library room ,delicious breakfast and nice rooms.  My 3 night stay was wonderful and I was sorry to have to leave.",5,2017,01,03
13,Great ambiance Great food ,"If you love excellence  in ambiance , service , and quality food , this is the place to be .

A variety ""out of the box"" gastronomy like pumpkin humus with anise seeds , avocado with fresh herbs , scallops in wine buttery sauce , to name a few .

The interior is a breathtaking experience similar to that of Ham Yard  Hotel although of a different style.

The low acidity olive oil served with a selection of freshly baked breads is an additional touch .",5,2017,01,02
13,Great location and service ,"Cotton house is a beautiful hotel. It was an old mansion that was eventually converted in to a hotel. Everyone at the hotel is nice and works hard to provide superior service. The concierge is great in helping to find tickets to attractions as well as booking it. The only problem with the hotel is the bathrooms. They are poorly designed and rather dangerous. The floors in the shower is either made of fiberglass or plastic. There is a tub and a separate stand up shower in the bathroom. The floor gets extremely slippery after you shampoo and wash your body. If you slip and fall, you will definitely hit your head on the tub and either die of aneurism or will have a concussion.
The food in the hotel is great, as well as the service. The breakfast is a selection of juices, cold cuts, fruits, breads, muffins and sweets. ",4,2017,01,01
13,Coffee and drinks,"Lovely hotel. Haven't stayed but we go there for coffee, drinks and light meals when in Barcelona. Very stylish decoration with amazing service and a beautiful terrace. Quite pricey but worth it for a bit of luxury.",5,2017,01,01
13,Inspired design; good but not great service,"This hotel is worth a visit to enjoy the outstanding work put into the interior design. Both the common spaces and the private rooms are inspired and helped make our visit to Barcelona something special. Of the photos we took of this beautiful city, a good many were of the inside of this hotel!

The location of this hotel is also ideal. Just on the edge between Eixample and Gotic districts, most major offerings are walkable.

The service is, unfortunately, not up to par with the 5 stars this hotel is trying to achieve. There is a lot of enthusiasm and energy; truly, many busy bees. But I've never seen so little focus with so much motion. This place has something more to aspire to.

For example, on the two evenings my wife and I spent at the bar, stacks and heaps of used glassware shared the bar with us as servers placed used items there. We supposed waiting for the bartender to take care of, but he was in full motion turning out orders. The wait staff repeatedly passed these stacks by and offered the bar no assistance. We observed other tables stacked with dishes for over an hour at times as well. Again, repeatedly passed by empty-handed staff.

Jonatan, the aforementioned bartender was an absolute professional and a clear example of the service this hotel works for but simply overwhelmed. Frankly, it seemed that a floor manager was either not in attendance during our stay or not in control of the floor.

Aside from the oversights, the staff was always absolutely cheerful and eager to please. If the Cotton House can work out the kinks, it will be one special place. We will visit again with high hopes!",4,2017,01,01
13,Excellent Hotel and outstanding service! ,"I generally stay in hotels half the year traveling for work so I have a little knowledge about hotels and the service you can expect. I took a short trip just prior to Christmas to Barcelona and stayed in the Cotton House Hotel.
It was a real treat. The hotel is a special place and very nice accommodations. Room well appointed and clean as to be expected in the level hotel. But what really made the hotel special was the service we received from the moment we arrived until we departed five days later. 
This includes all parts of the staff but I have to make a special comment about two really friendly and helpful members of the staff. Jonatan was a master in the bar and served some wonderfully delicious cocktails on a couple of occasions and then Nuri in the restaurant and bar was such a delightful young lady and very helpful with the service but also providing us insight into Barcelona.
I would highly recommend this hotel. Again we really enjoyed our stay! ",5,2016,12,30
13,My FAVORITE Hotel anywhere!!,"From the moment we were greeted by the smiling faces of all of the employees of the Cotton House, to our departure, we were treated like royalty! The service at this hotel is impeccable and our stay was everything and more than we would have ever dreamed it to be. I wish I had every name of each individual employee to mention and give the highest of accolades to but we have traveled through Spain & I am now confusing the names & locations. On the other hand, I can honestly say that each and every person demonstrated an outstanding commitment to their job and the hotels superb reputation. The Cotton house could not have been more accommodating or beautiful. It exceeded our expectations in every way! With it's rich sense of history, which has been exquisitely preserved, to the pride & joy each and every employee took in servicing us to the umpteenth degree. 
My friend and I traveled together, and while the room was stunning, we knew we might have difficulties in getting ready at the same time daily once we saw the room layout. They of course were eager to satisfy us and graciously did trying to be sensitive to our pocketbooks as well. Our rooms were luxurious and the beds and bedding were extremely comfortable.
The Concierge assisted us in sifting through tours & scheduling for us exactly what we wanted. On one of the days, after a helicopter ride, my friend became ill in the taxi cab. The even took care of this for us by helping to communicate to the taxi for me and cleaning the floor of the taxi. We owe them a HUGE thanks for this and everything they did. This was certainly going above & beyond the call of duty.
We were beyond impressed by this hotel and know that anyone who stays here will be too. The location within Barcelona is superb, walking distance to most anything. The food at the hotel was excellent, and the dining experience was so exquisite too. There just aren't enough words to articulate our positive experience. You will just have to see it for yourself! I have many places on my list to see, but because of this unusually excellent experience, I may have to return sooner!!!",5,2016,12,24
13,My new favorite hotel in Barcelona!,"This place is great!  The rooms, the location, the staff, the food, the bed, I can't say enough about this place.  I can't wait to go back to Barcelona and stay at this hotel again!  It's a bit more expensive than the rest, but it's surely worth it!  I just wish there was a coin laundry in the hotel.",5,2016,12,20
13,A dream come true on a rainy night in Barcelona,"I booked the Cotton House Hotel as a birthday surprise for my husband, who knew where he was staying but not why :-)
I got to the hotel early at around 6.30pm in a Barcelona downpoor and I was soaking wet.  
I was greeted by two absolutely fabulous people, one was called Reyes (and his English was superb) and the other gentleman was Alejandro (Jandro) who was on Reception.  Whilst Jandro did all the paperwork, even managed to upgrade our room and gave me all the right instructions on how to park the car, Reyes brought me a towel to dry off, he gave me a delicious glass or Cava and some chocolates.
I just felt at home.
The room was superb, we had a balcony looking over the terrace (nice and quiet) and even though it still poured down, it was a beautiful spot to sit and drink wine.  There was a complementary bottle of Marques de Riscal 2011 and a lovely bowl filled with chocolates and Macarons - delicious!!!  Then then Reyes came and helped me to understand how the technical side of the room worked (tv, coffee machine, A/C, shower, etc.) and then room service brought me a fabulous BlueTooth sound system so I could listen to my music off my phone.  I was in Heaven.
The bathroom was clean and beautiful to shower in, more like a hot downpour, but it was super.
The bath towels were thick and warm and we had lots of little bottles of shampoo and conditioner and all sorts of treats.

I left for my dinner and met my husband later.  To our complete surprise, when we got up to the room, there were red rose petals everywhere and a really cute heart shape on the bed.  Thank you for that detail, it was very romantic.
We ordered some wine and some special ale for my husband as well as a selection of cheeses and we felt like Kings for the night.

The next day, the sun was shining and we really enjoyed a coffee from the balcony, listening to our music and watching the Cotton Hotel Terrace be converted into a beautiful Christmas Market.

When we left, our car was brought around for us too.

I would just like to say on behalf of myself and my husband, you made our stay at the Cotton House very special.  We will recommend you and we will definitely be returning again.

Thank you especially to Jandro and Reyes for their hospitality.  They made it magic!

13,"Beautiful hotel, amazing service ","Stayed here for more than a week for a conference and solo vacation time around Barcelona. It has an outstanding location, truly unique and beautiful ambience, and excellent service. The staircase is so cool!

I shipped multiple packages to them for our conference booth and they had it all ready from me the moment I got there. The staff is attentive and welcoming. 

Also, true to its name, the linens here are wonderful. Would purchase them for my home if I could. ",5,2016,12,14
13,Like a warm fresh towel,"Walking into this hotel you feel enveloped in a warm fresh towel, plush, comfortable and homey.  The historic architectural details play off the modern interiors and there is something interesting to see around every corner.  The courtyard is a great place any time of day to grab a drink or a snack.  The breakfast is very good and the service is astounding.  The best part of the hotel is the bed! You feel like you are sleeping on a fluffy cotton ball.  If not for the vibrant city of Barcelona I would have stayed in that bed all day!",5,2016,12,12
13,Perfect hotel for our week in Barcelona,"My husband and I just returned from our trip to Barcelona and loved staying at The Cotton House. We love Autograph Collection hotels and this one did not disappoint. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is incredibly attentive. Great views at night on the 6th floor terrace. The restaurant food is delicious. It's an easy walk to area attractions. Concierge service helped us with car rental, soccer tickets and so much more. The staff at the restaurant is excellent! Our room was spacious, super comfortable bed and I loved the bathroom and walk in closet space!

13,Fabulous facilities and fantastic staff,"Stayed at the Cotton House with my wife on a business trip in November. This is a fabulous property with a wonderfully calm and opulent ambiance. The staff, from top to tail, were absolutely brilliant throughout our stay - professional, knowledgeable, courteous and really helpful. Highly recommended!",5,2016,12,09
13,Beautiful hotel! Nice people. Good food and decent rooms,We stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay very much. At first my husband was not happy with the small size of our first room (although it was totally fine for Europe's standards...) but the front desk graciously moved us to a slightly bigger room. The rooms are clean and pretty. The breaksfast was really good and the various common rooms in this hotel were gorgeous. It's old and original but by now means shabby...Very elegant and peaceful. The location is nice... away from the tourist areas but close enough for ease walking or in taxis. Mr. Fana was also very welcoming and helpful!,4,2016,12,07
13,Beautiful Property with First Class Service,"The Cotton House is a charming small hotel located in the heart of Barcelona.  The rooms are lovely, the property gorgeous and the staff magnificent.  Breakfast each morning in the dining room was fabulous.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,12,07
13,Perfect Location,"My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House in October. From the minute you walk through the doors you are treated royally. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. The staff; from check in, concierge, restaurant staff, housekeeping are so kind, attentive and helpful. The location is perfect. A short walk to Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas. We had breakfast each morning at the hotel. The food was amazing. We enjoyed drinks at the outside bar in the evenings. I would highly recommend The Cotton House when you visit Barcelona!",5,2016,12,07
13,Best of the Best,"We chose the Cotton House because of its location and architectual appeal and,
we were not disappointed.

Former site of the cotton industry in Spain, the hotel has been reinvented as one
of the cities premier boutique hotels.  The rooms, while not oversized like most
European hotels, was well appointed and offered all the necessary amenities.

We opted for the bed and breakfast option which afforded a wonderful buffet
breakfast every morning, with the option to order from the menu.  The evening
meal had a varied menu and engaging waitstaff ... with special kudos to Tony,
who is destined for much success in the hospitality field.

Stay here, and you won't be dsappointed.",5,2016,12,06
13,"AMAZING MATTRESS, SHOWER, BREAKFAST, SERVICE...","My husband and I stayed at this hotel during our trip to Barcelona. It is SO NICE. The staff is very helpful and attentive. I felt kind of weird because every where I turned there was someone offering me chocolates or water. The decor is so beautiful at this hotel. I loved their shower here. It has the rain shower so the water falls directly from above you. The pressure is nice and strong and they have a setting that gets the water ultra hot. My husband loved it so much he showered 2-3 times a day just because the shower felt so good. We got the best sleep here at the Cotton House because their mattress is nice and firm, but soft at the same. 

The Cotton House is at a great location. It is a walkable distance to Placa de Catalunya and there are lots of metro and bus stops nearby.

We ate breakfast at the hotel every morning. They have fresh veggies and fruits. They had an assortment of breads, pastries, yogurt, granola, muesli....The list goes on and on. You can order extra food from their menu, but what they had displayed out for breakfast was more than enough for us. Their dining area is full of glass windows which allows natural light in. It illuminates the dining room. They have a small area in the dining room that is filled with the cotton linens they sell. It is displayed nicely on the walls. This hotel is so beautiful and the service is absolutely amazing.",5,2016,12,06
13,Beautiful,"Simply beautiful property, from A to Z. First 2 floors were kept as originally built, with flooring and rooms layout, plus added decoration from those times. Breakfast is continental, but the best and most beautiful i ever seen. Egyptian suite is cosy, with small balcony to inner yard. Staff is professional and attentive. 5 minutes walk to Passaig de Garcia and city center.",5,2016,12,05
13,Charmed in Barcelona ,I love the location of this game of a hotel. Location is incredible and the room nicely appointed. Restaurant was very good for dinner as well as tapas and wine selection. Great value for Barcelona close to everything. ,5,2016,12,04
13,Lovely Convenient and New Hotel,"I stayed almost 5 days at this hotel.  The rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable.  The hotel is only a couple of years old at this point, so the hardware and furniture is all in good order.  The look is modern and stylish.  The service was prompt, professional, and always pleasant.  I requested the concierge to make two restaurant reservations.  Each time the reservations were made precisely and a written note was delivered to the room to confirm the appointments.  Lobby staff was very friendly and quick to provide refreshments and bottled water.

The hotel is conveniently located 2 blocks from the Placa de Catalunya and the Ramblas.

I did not have the breakfast nor did I use the spa/gym.

I can recommend this hotel.",5,2016,12,03
13,Wonderful Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed here for a week in early November and had a wonderful time. The hotel is very new, and located in a spectacular building. They have done an excellent job of retaining some of the classic characteristics of the building and it's history while creating modern and very elegant rooms. 

The rooms themselves are very well appointed. The beds are incredibly comfortable and the amenities are excellent as well. The room we were in faced over the courtyard and terrace with a small balcony. The only negative is that the sliding doors are not as soundproof as one would expect and it can be a little noisy with people out on the terrace having drinks late at night.

The hotel restaurant has an excellent breakfast and the food is also quite good. The menu for dinner is a bit eclectic, but the quality of preparation is very high. Having a drink on the terrace or at the bar is also fantastic. 

The location of the hotel is very good - easy walking distance to La Rambla, Placa de Catalunya and to El Raval and El Born areas. We were able to walk to La Sagrada Familia in about 25 minutes as well. 

Finally, the staff at the hotel are amazing - extremely helpful, friendly and attentive. They really have a wonderful team working there. The concierge support is excellent and available for extended hours. At times they have two concierges working to help guests. 

Overall, a wonderful hotel that I highly recommend.",5,2016,11,29
13,"Historical building, central location in the heart of the City","We stayed for a bit more than a week in this fantastic hotel. The building was erected to be the Cotton Trading House. It has lovely high ceilings, impressive wood flooring, amazing liberate, beautiful terrace and above all amazing staff. We stayed in The Cotton Room, it was spacious, the hotel is relatively very new, very stylish and in the heart of the city, walking distance from most attractions. I highly recommend this hotel for business and leisure stays. Thanks a lot Cotton House for an amazing Summer in Barcelona :)",5,2016,11,29
13,Wonderful Hotel To Use While On Vacation In Barcelona,"My wife and I plus my two grown sons spent 5 full days in Barcelona on vacation during Thanksgiving week. Loved the city. We definitely liked this hotel  and would stay there again if in Barcelona again. The hotel is located pretty much in the center of the things we wanted to do. And for those things a bit far away--nothing seems  too far away--the metro system is easy to use and get around. (We got a 5 day city pass that was helpful.) The rooms were very nicely appointed and included a balcony. We looked out over the inner courtyard. The staff were very attentive. Without my asking, they gave my son a birthday gift of a bottle of wine and a platter of small cakes along with a very nice note. (He is in his 20s.) I am a Marriott platinum member so breakfast was included; it's a bit pricey if you have to pay compared to what you get out on the street. But, for breakfast, they had a very nice assortment of things to eat; fruit, yogurt, cheeses, different types of bread, salad, breakfast meats and a wide assortment of pastries. This hotel just opened, evidently a year ago. It  is beautiful inside and is very nicely appointed. On the sixth floor is an outside area, where you have a swim- lane type pool and areas to sit.",5,2016,11,28
13,Beautiful and elegant stay,"I booked this property on points and it couldn't have been better. I was upgraded to a slightly larger room overlooking the street (not loud unless you opened the window) which was nice for feeling like you were in the city. With my status I got breakfast included, and while it was a continental one (hot dishes were extra) it was delicious-bread, cheese, yogurt, fruit, coffee, juice, pastries, some cold meats/salmon. The staff were so friendly, the room was elegant but not over the top, and the bed was sooo comfortable.  About a 10 minute walk from where you can take the airport bus, and walkable to all areas of the city. Would recommend for anyone staying in Barcelona. ",5,2016,11,27
13,Five days in Barcelona ,Stay at the cotton house hotel in January during a trip through Spain. The hotel is beautiful and close to La Rambla although quite a hike from many of the other sites in Barcelona. Break was included since we were Marriott platinum members and it was  fantastic. The rooms were on the small side but very nice and bright. They were also very quiet which is great for us light sleepers.,5,2016,11,27
13,The ultimate chic venue,"We spent a weekend in Barcelona with our young children and couldn't choose a better place to stay. Cotton House is probably the most sophisticated yet modern hotel I've been to. And I have seen a few:-) totally in the zeitgeist for what concerns decor and atmosphere, this hotel has lovely staff and an amazing attention to detail. Everything is carefully selected, from the toiletries to the items in the mini bar. It feels more like the nicest private house you can think of than a hotel and that is what makes it special. Breakfast is impressive and service spotless. A fantastic place, where I cant but recommend! ",5,2016,11,26
13,Amazing hotel!!!,"The hotel is fantastic. The crew is kind and sweet; we were able to speak almost all languages we know with them. The hotel location is great, only two blocks to the subway station. The hotel is clean and decoration is beautiful. Bed is amazing and shower is perfect! Everything we wanted in a hotel.",5,2016,11,25
13,Highly recommended,"The staff was very helpful! They helped us with the camp nou tickets, taxis, recommendations and club bookings.
Its location is great, everything is in a walkable distance.
The hotel was beautifully decorated, modern yet classic! 
",5,2016,11,23
13,Extremely nice hotel with great and knowledgeable staff.  Reyes is especially good at the concierge desk.,The room was very nice and the Library sitting area is exquisite.  The staff knows about all of the attractions and you can book tickets at the hotel for many of the tours.   Food was fantastic and the wait staff was great,5,2016,11,20
13,Wonderful stay,"I am a Marriott gold elite member and stayed at the  Cotton House for 1 night post cruise. The reservation was booked with points and I was upgraded to a room with a balcony.  This was my first stay at an Autograph Collection hotel and I was pleasantly surprised.  The hotel was lovely, service great.  More personal than the larger hotels.  The room was not overly large (consistent with European hotel rooms) but well outfitted.  Unfortunately, it was too cold to use the rooftop pool.  Breakfast was delicious.  The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks from Plaza Cataluyna.  Strongly recommend.",5,2016,11,20
13,Amazing hotel!,"Set within really amazing Art Deco surrounding, this hotel is one of the best in Barcelona, the service is excellent, the rooms are big and really clean and charming and the local bar and restaurant looks amazing!",5,2016,11,19
13,Exquisite Boutique Hotel.,"Absolutely one of my favorite hotel stays this year.  I landed a high quality room which was clean, spacious and quiet.  The staff were top notch with exceptional English and Spanish-speaking ability.  I would stay here again!",5,2016,11,18
13,Lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"Chose the Cotton House from the TA ratings and we were able to use points. The beautiful boutique hotel is located several blocks from the Airport bus stop so for those hearty souls who pack light, it's an easy walk. For others like us who bring a lot of stuff, a short cab ride was in order. Service was excellent. The property was spotless. Our room was functional and the beds were comfortable. The restaurant looked interesting but being in for only one night, we decided to step out. Unfortunately, the Tapas place we chose around the corner was forgettable. Win some and lose some. You won't go wrong here. You will find us at the Cotton House on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,11,18
13,"Perfect Location, Refined & Eclectic Five-Star Accommodations","My wife and I did some research and stumbled upon a new, Marriott-owned property called The Cotton House, which opened its doors in 2015 and is part of the global hotelier’s Autograph Collection.
l
From the moment we arrived, the staff, led by Alfredo Martinez, could not have been more accommodating. Built in the 19th century for the Cotton Textile Foundation “Fundación Textil Algodonera,” it embodies the neoclassical style with striking architectural details throughout. These included wood-inlaid marquetry floors, a dramatic circular staircase (physically suspended from the top to bottom floor), elaborate, but tasteful ceilings and chandeliers, and plush and super comfy furnishings in all the public rooms. Many of the public rooms extended the cotton theme, with fabric samples displayed in windowed cabinets, etc.

Our room was an “Egyptian” room, and included a private outdoor patio. In addition to the superb dining accommodations and an audacious breakfast buffet, the hotel has an outside area off the dining rooms for drinks or just to hang out. On its 6th floor, one can find the lap pool, a small workout room, and chaise lounges, plus dramatic panoramic views of the city that include La Sagrada and the Pyrenees Mountains on an especially clear day.

We simply loved the Cotton House and would highly recommend it. As New Yorkers who like to walk, we found its central location especially appealing. We also want to thank Alfredo and his colleagues for making our stay there a most memorable one.",5,2016,11,17
13,The Heart of Barcelona,"I visited Barcelona for the first time back in September 2016.  While trying to locate a hotel in the city center, I ran across a boutique hotel called Cotton House.  The hotel is wonderfully decorated and the staff engaging and courteous to its clients.  I had read online different reviews on the property and was curious to see what my overall stay would be like.  I could not have been better taken care of.  
The Batuar restuarant's food was amazing, drinks were refreshing, and the wait staff very attentive to your needs.  While the staff is young and some are doing internships at the hotel...if you engage them...they are very polite and go out of their way to take care of you.  
The rooms were very clean and good sizes for european standards and the design inspiration of cotton makes them serene feeling.  Nice place to lay your head after running around the gothic quarter all day.
I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, holiday travel or for a the quick get away from it all.  
I hope to get the chance to stay here again in the future during my travels.
Thanks for taking good care of me during my visit to the heart of Barcelona...Cotton House...home away from home.

13,"Elegance, Convenience and Service - trifecta!","This property exceeded my expectations in every way. It was elegant yet comfortable. The room amenities (bed linens, espresso machine, etc.) were fabulous. The terrace was beautiful as were the furnishings. The bath/shower were huge. 

Reyes Fana, my favorite doorman ever, was always ready to greet me back from my explorations/adventures with a huge smile and desire to help with anything I require. The front desk staff worked diligently to get my room ready early after an all night flight. The breakfast was sumptuous. I could not have enjoyed my stay more!",5,2016,11,15
13,elegant boutique hotel,"This hotel is in a great location and is beautiful throughout. Nice to just walk into the library or restaurant. So much attention to detail!

The only problem is that the WiFi was usually slow and often didn't work at all. I called about this on the first of five nights and they fixed it for a while. But soon the problem returned. 

Other than spotty WiFi it's an ideal place to stay. 

",4,2016,11,15
13,Amazing deck top views,"Rooms were stunning. Bathroom amenities outstanding. Updated 19th century building with unique boutique like features. The staff was very professional even to all the rude American's demanding an early check in. People go to the bar or pool! 
Central location and close to the high end shopping.",5,2016,11,14
13,Stephanie M.,"Elegance. Warmth. Hospitality. Charm. Comfort. All of this and more defines our stay at this beautiful hotel. Conveniently located in the Eixample district of downtown Barcelona, you're walking distance to shopping, restaurants, museums, and local markets.  The concierge was helpful in acquiring our tickets to the fútbal game, jazz concerts, and museums. Staff is friendly and always greeted us with smiles. We enjoyed our week stay at this amazing property and highly recommend it. We will definitely return.  Hopefully sooner than later.  ",5,2016,11,14
13,Great hotel,"Stayed three days at this great hotel before starting an Atlantic cruise. Staff were friendly and courteous, food was good but expensive. Room was spacious and clean. Can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,11,12
13,An amazing experience in a beautiful boutique hotel,"On return from a western Mediterranean cruise, we checked into this elegant landmark hotel at the heart of Barcelona.  The front-desk personnel were friendly and welcoming: they offered a glass of water and a snack as we completed the check-in process.  The room (503) was well-appointed with deluxe amenities. It has a balcony with plantation shutters and wicker furniture, overlooking a patio restaurant on the ground level. The bed was comfortable with luxurious 300-thread-count cotton sheets.  
The Concierge Team is one of the very best Hotel Concierge Team I have met:  each member made us feel at home during our stay. Team members recommended restaurants and made reservations for us; purchased sight-seeing tickets on-line for us and provided a guided tour of the Hotel and facilities and also helped extending our stay for one more night on short notice. 
A big thank-you to Damien, Faisal, Jenny and Nick at the Concierge Desk; and Tatiana, Tatiana and Gabriel at the front desk.  Cotton House – highly recommended! (Best wishes to Jenny, who will be returning to her studies in Switzerland upon completing internship in the Hotel).",5,2016,11,12
13,Cotton House Barcelona ,"Excellent boutique type hotel with Marriott credentials. Beautiful 19th century building undated to please today's travelers. The staff is attentive, very friendly and helpful. The 2nd floor patio outside the bar and restaurant is beautiful as well as comfortable. Overall the entire experience was excellent.",5,2016,11,12
13,Great Boutique Hotel,"A super nice hotel in a magnificent old building in a great location in the city

The rooms are beautifully appointed and the common areas really well decorated in an elegant old style way

The staff were all very friendly and obliging.

All in all a very elegant and well run hotel in a great location.",5,2016,11,09
13,All I can say is WOW,"The Cotton House is a MUST when coming to Barcelona. Amazing hotel in an amazing city. Location is about a 5-10 minute walk to Las Rambles, easy to get to from airport (I took a taxi and it was €30 with a decent tip). 
The staff are some of the best I have experienced in a hotel. The rooms are not huge, but it is an historic building so your not going to get that. The rooms are extremely well appointed and the beds a very very comfortable. I can't fault this property at all.
I wish I was staying longer in this fantastic city so I could explore more and enjoy more of the amenities this hotel offers. Do yourself a favour and book your Barcelona stay at The Cotton House.",5,2016,11,09
13,Amazing experience,Very beautiful hotel with amazing stuff. A great choice for romantic getaways. We love the library and the shirt atelier. Foods and bar is also great. We recommend this hotel for couples more than families since there is not much attraction for children. Special thanks to Reyes Faña,5,2016,11,09
13,Top Notch Hotel,"Everything about the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona was perfect for our recent visit.  The staff is well-trained, polite and very accommodating and helpful.  Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted and assisted with our bags, offered water and a snack and helped with the check-in process.  After checking in, we were offered a tour of the hotel common areas, which are gorgeous, and shown to our room where our bags were already waiting.  We had cocktails on the patio, which is one of the most relaxing places I've ever seen.  Our room was clean, spacious and had a lovely view of the patio below.  We were in room 507 and highly recommend reserving a room with a balcony.  The balcony was definitely worth the additional cost.

Overall, our favorite hotel of a 4-city European tour.  We will definitely stay at the Cotton House again on our next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,11,08
13,Gorgeous Boutique Hotel in Downtown Barcelona- A Must,"Spent a wonderful weekend in Barcelona with my wife, and we are so happy to have chosen this beautiful, Marriott affiliate hotel for our mini-trip.
Its young, warm, friendly and totally service-oriented staff will make you feel at home from the first minute. 
The building used to house the city's tailors guild and has been remodeled with a lot of good taste to evoke a past era of grandeur. 
Its rooms are small but comfortable, fitted with an invisible TV and ultra comfortable  mattress and bed set.
Will be back!",5,2016,11,07
13,Delightful hotel with great service,"Booked hotel with Marriott points and wasn't sure what to expect but it has been a wonderful stay. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Concierges helped me purchase tickets online for the Gaudi museum and other popular sites. Towels, Bed linens and pillows fit the namesake and are fabulously soft and comfy. For a European hotel, bath and shower are very spacious.  Location is convenient to the subway, shopping and restaurants. Hotel restaurant has a fantastic breakfast buffet. Gym has limited equipment but plenty of other things to do in the city.",5,2016,11,04
13,"Chic, luxe and fun","Cotton House is my new favorite hotel in Barcelona, which I visit about 14 days a year.  The hotel is relatively new and well done - pretty rooms, quiet, everything works well, great beds/linens, excellent bar and breakfast. They also have a dinner restaurant but I didn't try it.  The 1st floor (one up from the ground floor for us estadounidenses), has a terrific spaces - bar with a library and mulitple rooms for drinks, relaxing & breakfast, a beautiful terrace, and the concierge desks.  About concierges, it is the one weakness of the hotel; they are young and not as helpful or knowledgeable as those at other excellent hotels in town.  They were nice but slow and didn't solve many porblems or give great advice.  The desk staff are also young but enthusiastic and fast with smaller things.  

But back to this lovely hotel.  Many rooms face inward onto the quiet center of the block, and we just loved hanging out at the hotel.  It is close to the Plaza Catalunya, so the area 2 blocks away is touristy, but not bad right at the hotel and that also means it's a quick walk to the Born and Casco Antiguo.  

The ""gym"" is so tiny it is not useable, but the pool and roof deck are nice.

There are a couple other good options in town for small luxe hotels that cost less than the expensive Oriental, but this si right up there and for now my top choice.",5,2016,11,02
13,"Lovely hotel, outstanding staff and perfect location","This was the start of a long awaited retirement trip and the Cotton House was a great start.  As advertised the building has been beautifully restored with a feeling of elegance and calm.  Our welcome after the long flights and a morning of touring Barcelona was warm, an introduction to what we would find throughout the hotel.  We were upgraded to an Egyptian room with balcony overlooking the courtyard - wonderful place to sit when jet lag has one up at odd hours.  The bed and sheets were crisp and perfect to sleep in.  Our breakfast was included and we certainly took advantage of the beautiful Serrano ham and cheeses along with fresh fruit.  Location wise it could not have been better for us - we had planned on using the Metro but found all our explorations could be accomplished on foot.  Whenever we had questions the lovely ladies at reception were quick to help us out.  This is certainly a hotel we would love to visit again - quiet elegance in beautiful Barcelona.",5,2016,11,01
13,Loved it,"Great location in Barcelona, walking distance from La Rambla, Paseo de Gracia. 
It's all about details in this hotel, from the time you arrive until you leave. 
The staff is young and outstanding (difficult to find in hotels nowadays unfortunately). 
The decoration revolves around cotton. The rooms are very cozy and the bed is very comfortable.
I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again. 
Good job 👏🏻👏🏻",5,2016,11,01
13,Comfortably Elegant Boutique Hotel,"Walking up to Cotton House, it is very unassuming and one might just continue past not knowing what awaits inside.  It is clearly someplace special and unique, from the gorgeous spiral staircase to the library area on the mezzanine level.  
My stay was related to a business conference and there were several of us arriving at different times/dates that changed several times.  The staff were very accommodating with the multiple changes.  The facility itself is simple elegance as are the rooms.  Lovely bedding, towels, lighting in the rooms.
Centrally located, it is a 15 minute walk to sites in multiple directions.",5,2016,10,31
13,"Lovely Hotel, Great Staff, Central Location",The Cotton House Hotel is in a lovely historical building that has been transformed to a boutique hotel.  The staff are friendly and helpful and made our stay wonderful.  The hotel also provides a beautiful breakfast spread and serves great drinks and tapas in the evening.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of the Plaça de Catalunya and Las Ramblas.,5,2016,10,31
13,Beautiful Barcelona Hotel,"My husband and I used points to stay at the Cotton House Hotel for five days. Upon arrival, our stay got off to a shaky start with some concerning room issues, but I have never seen a staff or manager more responsive to our needs and concerns!the entire staff, the ""Gossypium Team"", is totally dedicated to the guests and did a splendid job. Special thanks to Miriam, Alexis on nite audit, Sebastian, Carmen, Alexia and Juanma . . All amazing! The hotel is beautiful and well located and our room was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend . . . Especially because of the amazing employees!",5,2016,10,31
13,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"Cotton House is more than just a nice hotel, it is an experience.  The hotel is well located and the decor and facilities of the property reflect the history of the building.  The rooms are very large and well equipped, and the staff is absolutely excellent.  The restaurant/bar area is very pleasant, and we enjoyed both a late evening (by our standards anyway) drink, and a very nice buffet breakfast in the morning.  The concierge desk was helpful in arranging dinner reservations for us, and their selection proved to be a great choice.  We were sorry that we only had one day here - we will certainly look to come again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,10,29
13,Lunch at Batuar Restaurant ,"A very fine restaurant in an elegant hotel.  The service is superb and the food is excellent.  Next visit to Barcelona you must try this restaurant.  The menu de dia is truly international with flavors from Asia, Europe and the Middle East all in one menu.",5,2016,10,28
13,Barcelona's unique boutique hotel,"Concluded our vacation by staying at one of the finest hotels ever: Marriott's AC Cotton House, near the center of Barcelona.

The beauty of the hotel is magnificent. This was formerly a cotton industry trade association office and was converted to a 5-star hotel.

The beauty of the staff is remarkable.  Upon arrival, a helpful staff member guided us through the hotel, pointing out features we would have missed.  After that awesome first impression, the staff continued to excel in treating us like honored guests. No request went unfulfilled and most were delivered above and beyond our expectations.

When I return to Barcelona, I will stay at this outstanding hotel.",5,2016,10,28
13,Beautiful Hotel!,"To begin with let me just say that Cotton House Hotel is more about the public areas than the room itself. Right from the reception, to the library, to Batuar (their cocktail bar & restaurant), their lounges and even the concierge's desk the Hotel has some of the most stunning interiors of any hotel I have been to. The hotel has beautifully preserved the original embellished ceilings & floors, the woodwork and the magnificent marble staircase from the former Cotton Textile Foundation contributing to the distinguished, luxurious feel of this hotel. Just walking into the reception transports you and the two enormous vases with the cotton twigs at the reception desk sets the whole theme for this hotel. 

Location: Located on Gran Via this hotel is a 5 minute walk from Plaza Catalunya and about 400 m from the Passeig de Gracia Metro Station. Walking up and down the street you will find many shops and even more dining options. 

It must be noted that the entrance of the hotel is extremely discreet and if you are not actively looking out for it you can easily walk past it. 

Rooms: We booked the Egyptian Cotton room on a triple sharing basis and it was a tight squeeze. With the three of us and our bags the room was quite cramped with barely any space to walk around. That being said, everything else about the room was spot on. The bed was amazingly comfy, we had a little balcony that looked out onto the terrace, a mini sofa & a flat screen TV. 

Services & Facilities: OMG that terrace! My favourite place to be at with my book at breakfast time. I would wake up and head down immediately for breakfast (which was amazing too BTW) and call for my cappuccino which was served in a little wooden tray with a glass of water and a chocolate. A perfect start to every single day that I was there. Unfortunately I didn't get to spend my evenings there too as I have heard they serve the most delectable cocktails at the bar. As mentioned earlier, this hotel has a library, a conservatory and several lounges which are all just one more beautiful than the other making you want to spend time in and savour each room. 

The staff at Cotton House were all really nice, courteous and helpful. 

The only thing that was mildly disappointing was the size of the plunge pool & the gym. They seemed like they would get crowded with just a handful of people so I chose to avoid it and enjoy the rest of the hotel instead.",5,2016,10,28
13,amazing boutique hotel,"My wife and I would had a most wonderful stay at the Cotton House last weekend. At the check-in the receptionist was able to change our room to the one that suited our preference. The concierge service assisted us throughout our stay with restaurant reservations and always followed up to make sure we had a positive experience.We stayed in room 201 that had a bath tub, terrace and a view of the  court yard.
We are looking forward returning to the Cotton House and highly recommend it!",5,2016,10,26
13,None better,"This hotel is 5 stars plus. The hotel is beautiful, and historic. The bar, library and terrace provide a very nice place to relax and socialize. The staff is excellent, from the reception desk through the concierge and the waiters. There is a very nice dining experience to enjoy as well. The room is tops. I can remember having stayed in none better. I must admit that my description here really is inadequate to convey how nice the hotel is. In addition, it is located very conveniently at the top of the historic section of Barcelona. This is a Marriott hotel, be sure that you are a Rewards member. It is a real worthwhile program. Thanks Marriott!",5,2016,10,24
13,Hotel for Design Buffs,"Visited this hotel in September. Great Location. Beautiful Interiors. 

The room that I had was not big but comfy nevertheless. The best part of the hotel was definitely the public areas. For a designer, I was fascinated with the beautifully conserved original details of the building and the amazing array of furniture that completed the whole look.

Love Batua the rooftop restaurant where we spent countless evenings sipping delicious cocktails -mainly spanish Gins! The Gym is extremely small, in fact it'd be too crowded to have two persons working out at the same time! But I guess ppl go to Barcelona to venture out and not spend time at the hotel gym.

Service staff were courteous and friendly. Will definitely be back again . SOON!

13,Beautiful building and wonderful service ,"My wife and I spent a weekend at Cotton House and consider it one of the best hotels we have ever used. The historic building has been beautifully restored including very contemporary guest rooms. The location is also great, on the Gran Via.  Breakfast was amazing. Perhaps best of all was the service from the friendly and well trained staff.",5,2016,10,21
13,We Love This Hotel!,"We stayed here for eight days as we explored Barcelona.  The hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance to many of the sites, including La Sagrada Familia (1 mile).  The area around the hotel is safe and we walked to and from dinner every night without worry.

The staff is wonderful and they all treated us warmly and ensured that our needs were met.  We really enjoyed meeting Amanda who took care of us one afternoon on the terrance.  The concierge people were wonderful and very patient with us.

Our room came with a free continental breakfast and it was wonderful!  Lots of selections with many new choices each day.  And, if you want something hot you can order it for 5 Euros.

The decor of the hotel is wonderful with a cotton theme (what else?).  I loved sitting in the library each morning to catch up on my emails while enjoying the old world sense of the room.

We stayed with Marriott Points and we're gold members so the breakfast was included.

If we ever come back to Barcelona we'll be staying here again!",5,2016,10,20
13,Incredible Hotel,"Amazing service, beautiful rooms, staff go above and beyond. Five star rooftop view from the pool.. Hotel is in a great location next to restaurants and shopping. Very impressive bar menu and service.",5,2016,10,18
13,Too much ,"The hotel is nice but the price is way too high
The concierge is not informed about train station rules 
They don't know the better restaurants
They have outdated literature for Segway tours
The draft beer is 2.50 eu all over Barcelona but it's 7.00 at hotel!!
Unacceptable for the price
Will not return here ",3,2016,10,17
13,"Unique and luxurious, in a great location!","My husband booked this hotel for three nights prior to us taking a cruise because it is a uniquely restored property and a luxurious Marriott Autograph Collection hotel. Our previous stays (including the AC Palacio del Retiro, Casa Monica, Cosmopolitan and Algonquin,) have each surpassed our expectations. We stayed in a ""madras"" room -- #314 that overlooks the street below, yet it was very quiet. The room's layout was interesting yet functional. The single sink is open to a hallway across from a water closet, and a ""bathing room"" that included both a hand-held and rain shower, and tub.  The room was standard in size but had every amenity. The internet connection was consistently good. Generously sized (paraben, silicone and gluten-free) ""Ortigia"" toiletries had a subtle fragrance. The embroidered white towels were huge, thick and plentiful. The bed was just amazing! The linens were so soft, pillows were perfect in different sizes, and my difficult-to-please husband had no complaints about the mattress! The staff was most welcoming and accommodating and will take you on a tour of the historic property, if requested. The public areas of the hotel are stunningly beautiful. The location was terrific and in the highly desirable Eixample section of Barcelona. We walked just a few blocks to the Sagrada Familia and many other attractions, restaurants and upscale shops are also nearby. A pool is on the top level which looked nice although we didn't use it. My husband did go to the small but adequate workout room on this top floor and used the treadmill. We really enjoyed our stay although we didn't take advantage of many other services that it offered!",5,2016,10,15
13,Best of the Best! Sublime experience.,"My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House for 5 nights in October, 2016. If you are vacationing in Barcelona, look nowhere else. Stay here. Can't say enough good things about it. The hotel is elegant and cozy, decorated in a modern art-deco, colonial style that respects it's origins as a ""cotton house"" where Barcelona society had their clothes designed and fitted---it's really beautifully done. Located in the heart of Barcelona, you can walk almost everywhere but a taxi stand is right on the block. But the best part of the hotel must be the staff who are friendly, knowledgeable and eager to make your stay special--- when you arrive, there is a staff member standing at the door to welcome you home-- another example? On our first night, the housekeeper came to turn down our beds but we were catching a ""siesta"" and did not need the beds turned down--- but my husband was craving some chocolates and asked if they left chocolates on the pillows. They don't evidently---- but when we returned from dinner, lo and behold, there were chocolates on our pillow and we found chocolates in our room EVERY night thereafter! Now that's service :)  We also found the concierges very helpful (thank you NIck) and the dining room waitstaff as well (Anna). The breakfasts were more than delicious and included a fruit and yogurt spread, tables laden with pastries, many juices, meats and breads to choose from, as well as eggs and other hot dishes. Really loved this hotel and will stay nowhere else should we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,10,15
13,A real value!,"The location couldn't have been better for walking, and walking or taxi.  Staff was welcoming, friendly and most helpful, going above and beyond to make our stay fondly memorable. The concierge was the best.  We will stay there again if ever we revisit, and recommend it to our traveling friends.",5,2016,10,14
13,The Best and Perfect Stay while in Barcelona,"I arrived in Barcelona on September 18th for a dear friend's 50th Birthday celebration. Upon my arrival to the Cotton House, I was immediately welcomed by the amazing reception team, staff and front door personnel.  I was checked in and escorted to a wonderful breakfast until my room was ready.  Within an hour, my room (604), my absolutely perfect room, was amazing!  Amazing view of the neighborhood, well appointed amenities and the MOST comfortable bed I have slept on.  This truly is a special place and I will stay here on future visits!",5,2016,10,12
13,perfect home base,"This hotel was a great home base for our days in Barcelona.  The room was comfortable and well-equipped, the public spaces were both beautifully decorated and comfortable, and the real stand-out was the service.  Front door help getting taxis, concierges great at organizing and assisting us with our plans, and in my own case, super-helpful when I left something behind and they got it back to me in record time.",5,2016,10,11
13,Fantastic Hotel,"The Cotton House is a fantastic hotel located in the middle of the Gran Via and away from the congested tourist area but yet close enough to go there if you desire.  The common area of this former mansion are just beautiful especially the garden restaurant area.  Staff is outstanding, friendly and always has a ""can do"" attitude.  This property was renovated into a hotel just over a year ago and is a modern hotel inside a beautiful historical structure.  It would be our first choice of a hotel when we return to Barcelona",5,2016,10,11
13,Beautiful hotel with extremely helpful staff,"This was our first stop in Spain and was the nicest (read ""fanciest"") hotel we stayed at. The location on gran via is central to almost everything we wanted to see. The building itself was absolutely beautiful. All of the staff we interacted with went above and beyond to be helpful and make us feel welcomed. Loved this place!",5,2016,10,10
13,Wonderful Hotel,The Cotton House is in a central location making it easy to walk anywhere in Barcelona. The buffet breakfast is very substantial and the service is great. The rooms are comfortable. The hotel staff is extremely accommodating. Great customer service. ,5,2016,10,10
13,Wonderful hotel,"An amazing hotel in barcelona. All the decoration, service, people, everything was great. 
They take in consideration all the details. The rooms, the Bibliotheca, the restaurant and terrace are so beautiful. Everything great. ",5,2016,10,06
13,Wonderful stay,"I am a little late to review my stay at the Cotton House Hotel Barcelona, and I apologize for this.

The hotel is amazingly located just a short walk from Plaça de Catalunya, within the city's centre.
My friend I just had the most wonderful time! The room we have been assigned was beyond beautiful, it was always spotlessly clean and very well laid out and designed.

The staff was incredibly kind and attentive, always taking the time to have a little chat even on a booked out period. 
The help received by the Gossypium team was excellent and the foundation for our exploring the city. 
I will definitely be back to BCN and hope to stay at Cotton House again. Thanks for all you did! See you soon!",5,2016,10,05
13,"Friendly staff, great hotel!","The staff seemed to always go above and beyond! They were friendly, polite, and helpful. The hotel was stunning and has a lot of history. The patio restaurant was delicious and staff was great. It is a great place to grab a drink after a day of touring. Great location as well!",5,2016,10,04
13,"Very good service, nice rooms, good food and drinks ","I've been at Cotton House for a long weekend and really enjoyed it. The service is attentive and polite. The rooms are very tasteful furnished, with a beautiful little balcony with view on the hotel terrace. Hotel with history, very good food and drinks. Nice, little pool in the roof! Even when you don't stay in one of the rooms-it's worth a visit for a drink on the cosy palm terrace! ",5,2016,10,03
13,Great hotel as long as you avoid the Panama room/cell!,"I say cell or rather luxury cell because basically there's no window. Yes, there's a glass pane that opens but only to the walls. There is no sight of natural light. After just one night I came out claustrophobic and distressed. Avoid this room at all costs. I am very disappointed in Marriott for not making this clear. It should have been clear threat the view is a wall one foot in front of you. I've been to many hotels where such an option was available but would always be indicated. I used my points for this room and wouldn't take it if it was free unless it was part of a reduced sentence. I'm sure other rooms at this hotel would have been nice beside otherwise it is a beautiful hotel in a great location.",1,2016,10,02
13,"Nice common parts, need better pillows","Great location, beautiful common parts - terrace, library, bar etc.
Room surprisingly cheaply finished for this kind of price level.  Uber-cheap laminate floor already chipped and peeling badly, despite being a pretty new fit out.  And at this price level you really ought to have proper pillows on the bed, not these Uber-cheap foam things that probably cost about 5€ each.  Dreadful. At least there were a lot of them...",3,2016,10,02
13,Who wouldn't want this AUTOGRAPH on your travel memories?!,"The beautiful Cotton House left its Autograph on us!  

Fantastic stay of two nights to set us if on a 5 week adventure through Spain, Morocco & Portugal. 

So easy to reach taking A1 Aerobus from BCN Airport (5,90€ each way PP). Get off on the last stop and walk about 5 blocks. And the hotel is just 3 blocks off if Passeig de Gracia. Such a PERFECT location! 

We were greeted by Delia who is such a sweetheart. They gave cold water and chocolates to welcome you at the reception desk. 

Our room was beautiful. The most amazing bed, pillows and linens! The toiletries were heavenly and oh that shower! 

You will get such a great workout while taking the spiral staircase that goes the entire 7 floors. Get your steps in and skip the elevators. Plus the artistic beauty of them is stunning! As is all the furnishings and decorating.   

The history of the building is a something you must study up on. Interesting past. Walk around and look into each room on the first floor. They also offer tours. 

Nice lap pool on the roof and what a view. You can see the Sagrada Familia! Lounge chairs were so comfy up there. 

We had the breakfast ""Buffet"" each morning. Yummy assortment of many breakfast items (European style) and fresh juices that made me go back for seconds. The spinach apple lemon was amazing.  

Delia happened to be the one (and with a young man) to check us out. The ENTIRE staff were top notch as is this Marriott property.  

We will be back. ",5,2016,10,01
13,Good Place to Stay in Barcelona,"This is a unique hotel with clean comfortable rooms and great service. From the time we arrived from the airport someone was there to help us with our bags, information and recommendations for all that we wanted to do and see. The hotel is conveniently located for shopping, sightseeing and places to eat within walking distance. We very much enjoyed our stay and will go back the next time we travel to Barcelona.",5,2016,10,01
13,Great Location - Great Property,"I booked the Cotton House in Barcelona for the first three days of two weeks in Spain.  I had never been to Barcelona so was not sure of the best location.  The Cotton House is just outside the main tourist area but easy walking distance to Las Ramblas, Plaza Catalunya and just a block or so from Passeig de Gràcia.  

The property is small with no lounge.  However, the public area in the library is really beautiful and breakfast, while typical for Spain with the cheese, cold cuts, and fruit, was very well done and included salmon as well for a very satisfying option without having to buy up to the hot selections.  

The room was very comfortable.  We were worried since it faced the street, but it was not noisy at all.  My wife and I were quite blown away by how nicely appointed the room was.  The sheets were crisp and clean and everything just spoke luxury.

OK - the pool might not be that great, but we are not swimmers and the rooftop was just another nice place to hang out and have a drink.

Finally, the staff were quite friendly and attentive. Overall, a great choice for Barcelona.",5,2016,09,30
13,A Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here the night before leaving on a cruise, and it was wonderful!  It's a beautiful hotel with modern room amenities conveniently situated between (and in walking distance to) La Sagrada Familia and La Rambla.  Service was excellent, and the food delicious!  We had no complaints or concerns whatsoever.  ",5,2016,09,29
13,Nice stay in a central location,"Barcelona was our third and last stop of a two week Spain vacation,  Our stay at the hotel was very nice.  The room we stayed in wasn't very big (smallest of the three places in Spain that we stayed), but it was pretty comfortable.  Having a second chair to sit on (so one of us didn't have to sit on the bed) would've been great, but the room wasn't big enough.  The pillows were way too soft, and I asked at the front desk for firmer pillows, but we never got them.

The breakfasts were very nice, and while it appeared that most of the people working in the restaurants were interns (with limited training), everybody was very friendly and tried their best to be helpful.

Our room faced the courtyard in the back, and on one evening there were some people sitting outside on the patio by the bar, and talking and laughing way too loudly at 1AM.  There should be a ""curfew"" hour when guests are asked to go inside, so that the guests could sleep.

If I could give 4.5 dots I would, as overall it was a very nice stay, but not at a five star great level.  Definitely worth returning to.",4,2016,09,28
13,Beautiful ,"I slept good every night, very comfortable mattress! It was about 30 min from airport €40. The breakfast was very good made to order eggs, pancakes or crepes. Unfortunately, there was a 'nat' problem all around the bakery cakes, breads, fruit just about anywhere food was on buffet tables. I have never seen infestation at any hotel I've stayed at before like this. The small cake provided upon check in also had nats flying around them. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it. ",4,2016,09,27
13,It's a splendid museum hotel,"Located at the very vicinity of Ramblas , this hotel is perfect for Families.
Though at the entrance you feel it is a small because of the lobby , but after proceeding to the main lobby, you are There in a great hall . The hotel has been a cotton mill and it has an area where you can view the history of this hotel.
Rooms are quite clean and the staff are very friendly . It is centrally located. ",5,2016,09,26
13,Nice hotel but poor restaurant experience,"We checked into the Cotton House for two nights using MR points and were unexpectedly upgraded to the Vichy Suite, a beautiful two-level suite with a curving staircase up to a sitting room and second bath at the top of the hotel, with access to a private rooftop terrace. The front desk staff were very accommodating, and the hotel is lovely and well-positioned. The only sour note was in the hotel restaurant. We arrived tired after a long train ride and wanted a easy dinner in the hotel, but the restaurant (which is very small for the size of the hotel) had no tables available. No problem, we were happy to eat at the bar, where there were seats available. Can't do that; they don't serve food at the bar. What??  We had a drink and ended up sitting on a couch with some appetizers. While we were there a few tables emptied, but neither the hostess nor anyone else offered to seat us properly. Unfortunately, that experience marred our appreciation of the hotel. We would not return.",3,2016,09,25
13,Great start to our trip!,"We stayed here for one night using MR points.

We arrived on a Thursday morning via taxi from airport.  We knew we likely could not check-in and were dressed appropriately to hit the streets.

Checked in with no problem.  Front desk staff were great.  There was water and a light dessert in the lobby.  We checked our bags and the hotel took our phone number so that they could contact us when the room was available.  

I believe we had a ""cotton"" room. We were on the 6th floor (memory fading). It is the same floor that provides access to the pool and awesome rooftop views.  Room was actually comparable to a U.S. hotel and probably a little larger.  The bath and shower were in a separate room from the other facilities.  There was a sliding door that could be used to close off the bathroom area for the bedroom.  We also had a nice sized balcony.  The balcony view was the hotel terrace.  

As a MR member, breakfast was included.  We were also offered a beverage in the bar area which we declined as we are not drinkers.

The walk to the main plaza area was about 7 minutes and less to the train station.  Great location and easy walk to everything.

We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.",5,2016,09,24
13,mediocre,"Average service.
Average location.
Rooms are pretty expensive for what you get. we had multiple rooms, 2 were extremely small and dark (1 small window in the corner) for €300+; we opted to pay additional for an upgrade for another room at check-in and that room was normal.
Nice decor in public areas.",3,2016,09,23
13,Stunningly Elegant,What an elegant hotel. Beautiful rooms with such great history. Lovely patio for eating or just enjoying drinks. Continental Breakfast was included and we were extremely surprised by the spread that greeted us. Our room faced the road with floor to ceiling windows and we could not believe how quiet it was. The sheets and bedding were of the softest cotton and felt like sleeping on a cloud! The service was impeccable. I highly recommend.,5,2016,09,23
13,"Fabulous hotel, beautifully presented","Enjoyed two nights at the beautiful Cotton House Hotel using our Marriott points and what a superb choice it was. 

On arrival we were offered a tour of this fascinating, historical hotel, which has been recently and sympathetically restored. Since it was never built as a hotel (see the website for its history), it avoids that bland or stuffy hotel feeling. It's more like a large boutique hotel, exuding the opulence of the era in which the building was first built. The excellent concierge arranges day trips, well-being treatments, restaurant reservations and you can even have a bespoke tailoring session in the fabulous tailor's room where a shirt with fabric of your choice will be made to measure - we didn't indulge but loved the fact this is available. 

We enjoyed expert and relaxing massages (one sports massage, one reflexology), available on-site in the small wellness room adjacent the pool. The concierge telephoned the spa and spoke in English, so we could understand what was being said to the spa staff. We thought this was highly professional.

Room 610 (a 'Panama' room) was well-equipped and beautifully presented with a large walk-in rain shower with additional hand-held shower head (note: no bath). The view is of a clean white-washed wall, but the advantage is it's incredibly quiet since the room is tucked away. Open the window and you'll notice how good the window sound-proofing is (very good)! We heard very little noise whilst in the room with the exception of an early riser in the hotel gym adjacent. This was the most peaceful hotel room we've stayed in, with a superbly comfy and extra wide bed too, top marks. The restaurant, breakfast room and hotel throughout is a delight, superbly appointed, and matched our expectations by looking exactly as it does on the website.

Easily accessible (10 mins walk) from Arc de Triomf and Passeig De Gracia stations or the helpful front desk staff can hail/book you a taxi elsewhere.

Overall, an exceptional 5 star hotel with superb staff. If you're looking for a 5 star hotel which doesn't feel like a 'business hotel' and puts the guest experience first, you must stay here. We hope to return!",5,2016,09,21
13,"Gorgeous hotel, lovely staff!","The Cotton House is everything a high end hotel should be. Front desk and doormen were always helpful without being intrusive.  The room was perfect in every way...in fact we took photos for when we redo our master bathroom. Comfortable beds, quiet room. We didn't have a view but there may be some rooms that have one.  Never had breakfast at the hotel because it was a buffet --generally never like them but who knows, Cotton House buffet may have been great.  (Around the corner is Al Sur and their food was superb! Very interesting menu)  Had delicious drink sitting on terrace...Lady Cotton? so good!",4,2016,09,19
13,Experience best of Boutique Hotels,"We were only able to stay 2 nights in this incredible property.  The building is historical yet detailed in both modern interior design and antiques. Beautifully executed design and very clean. Good staff with dual languages.  The room was very accommodating - slightly on the small side, but it worked.  Best A/C the entire trip. I found the beds, sheets and pillows to be the best and most comfortable I've ever slept on - bar none of any trip I've taken in the last 20 years. Pure pima cotton deluxe!   The location was great to walk to both the main touring of historical sites and shopping.  Or a 10 minute cab ride at best.  The breakfast provided was very good and varied. I would not hesitate to recommend it to the pickiest of travelers.",5,2016,09,17
13,Felt like sleepy on a cotton cloud,"After much travel throughout the region my husband decided to treat us to this boutique hotel. It was truly wonderful, lovely appointed room with luxurious bedding, amenities and for us a room that faced the street which was nice. The hotel is wonderfully appointed...so much so that the first day we never left the property! drinks in the library, dinner in the really nice restaurant, more drinks on the lovely veranda which was heated and the best night sleep of all our days in Spain. The next morning we had the most fabulous and extensive breakfast buffet I have ever had at any hotel abroad and I love breakfast. The staff was very accommodating and helpful. We found out how close we were to all the action, easy walking distance to most of the sites and also to the area where you catch the day trip buses (we caught a tour bus to Monserrat-beautiful views from the monastery). Loved our stay and would go back definitely the next time in Barcelona.",5,2016,09,16
13,Beautiful property but...,"We stayed one night after our cruise returned to port. The hotel is indeed amazing and has a detailed history. Perhaps it was because we 'paid' with points, perhaps not. Our room was not going to be ready for at least 5 hours and I kind of expected that. We went and did a Hop-On / Hop-off tour (which took most of the day) and stopped to eat at a delicious Italian restaurant recommended by the girl at Cotton House. We were on the same floor as the pool. I called down about my luggage, which was still not in the room. A half hour later I had to go get my luggage. Our 'view' was a couple of nicely painted walls. I would have hoped for more. I really was disappointed for the rating the hotel had.",3,2016,09,15
13,Excellent property,"The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to most of the interesting sights including La Perdera, Sagrada Familia, the cathedral, etc. The rooms are well appointed and spacious and During the blustering weather in the summer the A/C performed flawlessly.
The breakfast, dining and bar areas are beautifully decorated in rich paneling and classic Spanish decor and one can enjoy a morning breakfast on the lush veranda.

The staff is very friendly and helpful. The only negative is the advertised fitness center which is merely a bicycle machine and an elliptical which did not work very well. Should not even be classified as a fitness center.

Highly recommend.",5,2016,09,14
13,The Chicest spot in Barcelona,"Absolutely blown away by the intimate beauty of this hidden gem of a hotel. Exquisitely decorated hotel in the centre of Barcelona with a spectacular terrace. Wonderful to meet friends for drinks. Every inch of this beautiful old cotton mill has been impeccably decorated reflecting the chic, modern style of Barcelona. Quirky details highlight the modern, laid back elegance of The Cotton House Hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful, and speak numerous languages. Absolutely a must see!",5,2016,09,14
13,Platinum experience,"We loved the 2 night stay at the beautiful Cotton House hotel.  Marriott Platinums get free breakfast.  The rooftop swimming pool was wonderful.   The staff were friendly and accommodating, we were able to have our bags held from 7AM and do an check-in early at 1PM.  The concierge staff was very helpful for booking local tours.  We enjoyed the hotel tour by Miss Mueller too.",5,2016,09,13
13,Best Autograph Collection Hotel,"I have had mixed results of Marriott entering into the boutique hotel areas under the Autograph collection moniker, most times it is maybe as good as a Renaissance or standard Marriott but here was absolutely beyond what I am used to. We stayed on points and had upgraded our room to be on the back side with a balcony - well worth the effort in all those decisions. 

The staff are absolutely amazing, check in was warm and very giving asking what they could do, offered us a drink while we waited to get checked in. 

The room was very modern and sleek - the bathroom was well sized and great for two people. Very quiet at night was able to sleep well and be rested for everyday of exploring. 

We were offered the breakfast in the morning and were reluctant to take the offer but again well exceeded our expectations - more choices and fresh food than I have ever had at a Marriott property before. The sitting area was very relaxed and again the staff took care of us nicely and was very quick to restock items as they became low in the service area - it was a welcome way to start each day and for once did not feel like we were just having hotel food but rather items local to the area. 

The location was central and great to get around in general - highly recommend this hotel as a chain that does not feel like a chain experience at all.",5,2016,09,12
13,Exceptional Service | Elegant Hotel,"As soon as we arrived we were offered water and mini tiramisu desserts! They have a small rooftop pool and deck with great views of the city. The hotel has only been open a little over a year and all the furnishings are new. 
I'm not providing a 5 for this hotel considering their bar service was subpar. Rather than telling us the bar was closing, they decided to shut off the lights in the back patio at 10pm...on a Wednesday?!",4,2016,09,12
13,Lovely stay,"What a beautiful hotel. A very warm welcome, and fitted out wonderfully well. Pool area is small and the pool is tiny, but it did the job. Bar is gorgeous and while we didn't eat there the food looked great and the bartender made an excellent martini.
Room was very nice, bit of noise from building work outside but no big deal. Staff were all very friendly but with so many interns sometimes there were knowledge gaps or staff not knowing when to leave guests to themselves. It's a small quibble though, we would definitely stay there again.",4,2016,09,12
13,"Friendly, helpful staff, great atmosphere","I would recommend this place to my closest friends and family.
All of the English speaking staff were so friendly and helpful, and they really went above and beyond to make our stay here the best it could be.
We accidentally arrived a day early, and they took care of it for us, no problem. Next time I'm in Barcelona, I'm staying here for sure.",5,2016,09,11
13,Not a 5 star hotel,"Hotel has an excellent location however I wouldn't rate it 5 stars.   Rooms are average and cleaning is on the poor side.   We got a room with a balcony which goes for over $400, I was a little surprised to find several cigarette butts there.   The breakfast which is 30 euros is severely lacking, dont bother with it.   To add insult to injury,  our mini-fridge broke while we were here or perhaps it was already broken, we are traveling with an infant and we had stored all the milk in there which is now all spoiled (we are still here).  When I called the front desk I got an indifferent ""sorry for the inconvenience"" which really does nothing to get me out of the current situation without baby food.   Autograph collection?  I think not. ",2,2016,09,10
13,Great stay....,"Hotel has a real homely feel to it! They have kept a great ambience about the plan and the staff were attentive, friendly and extremely helpful!! The room was well presented and the the terrace and breakfast was fantastic. Will definitely be coming back here with my family soon",5,2016,09,10
13,Lovely old world luxury with updated building and rooms!,This was our first time at the Cotton House.  The hotel was convenient to everything.  The street was relatively quiet.  The breakfast was spectacular.  The entire staff was very young but extremely accommodating.  Our understanding is that many of the staff members are students training at hotel school.  They were delightful and so anxious to help.  Their language skills were excellent.  The concierge arranged a great tour of the City.  Our room was lovely.  The rooftop pool had a great view.  Marriott continues to please us and is so reliable.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.,5,2016,09,10
13,Just Amazing,"We spent the afternoon on the terrace, without being hotel guests, and we had an amazing time. The ambiance is cozy in the middle of Barcelona and the personnel was outstanding (reception, gosipium, cocktails and bar). We were recommended to take the Gosipium cocktail and it was awesome, I definitely recommend it to anyone stoping by the terrace and bar. I am looking forward to stay at the hotel in my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2016,09,09
13,Unique and authentic experience,"My wife and two young children stayed a few days in late August.  We all enjoyed our stayed at this beautiful hotel.  Every aspect of the property is unique and beautiful--the room, library, ""candy room"", patio, lounge area, outdoor dinning area, etc.  The check in was pleasant, service was efficient and customer service was top notch.  We will definitely revisit in the future. ",5,2016,09,08
13,Plesantly surprised,"We stayed here for one night before leaving for a cruise.  We really enjoyed our stay.  The staff was friendly, professional and helpful.   A staff person gave us a tour of the place including the history of the building which was very interesting.  The rooms were modern.  Our particular room was small but worked just fine for us since we only there for one night and didn't spend much time in our room.   We had a room with a view of a small courtyard area.  I would suggest requesting a room with an outside view.   Overall we were very pleased and would definitely stay here if we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,09,07
13,Beautiful and relaxing,"My husband and I stayed here at the start of our second honeymoon. Here is our experience- (it was good!) 
When we checked in, the staff had already upgraded us to a nicer room! They are very nice about storing your luggage and if you get there early you can go to the pool and relax until your room is ready, which is what we did. When our room was ready we we did not like the bed set up (it had 2 twin beds pushed together), and I had reserved a ""cama de matrimonial"". I went down and asked if we could please change, and the woman was very nice- she walked me to the room herself to make sure. Everyone from the server at the pool, to the front desk, to the nice man who helped us with our luggage was excellent. We did not want to leave. The pool area is small but very relaxing with a nice view- you can see the Sagrada Familia:) They have a pleasant area for the restaurant with alfresco dining. We LOVE LOVE the building itself - beautiful design and decor. The room was wonderful, very quiet and we had a balcony. The bed is incredibly comfortable. It will be difficult to top this hotel. The area is very safe, and convenient to walk to the gothic quarter. We will stay there again when we come back to Barcelona! Thank you to the staff for a wonderful stay!",5,2016,09,07
13,Fantastic Stay in a Fantastic Hotel,"Cotton House Hotel is part of the Marriott Autograph Collection, so my stay was primarily done with points and frankly the main reason I chose this property for a 5 night stay in August.  
This property exceeded all expectations and is truly 5 star worthy.  It is boutique size with approx. 50 rooms and located in the former cotton exchange in Barcelona - the cotton them is carried throughout the hotel.  The public spaces especially on the ground floor and 1st floor have been exquisitely restored to feature the original decoration and style of this building - and the results are simply beautiful.
I was greeted by staff at check in as a Marriott Gold member and was given a room upgrade at check in even though redeeming points.  The staff throughout the hotel were helpful, nice and available without being pushy.
The rooms are new, medium size, with all the 5 star amenities available.  The bed and bath linens are really nice and again carrying through with the cotton theme of the hotel. My room had a balcony which overlooked the back of the hotel and the restaurant/neighborhood area.  There was absolutely no noise coming from the restaurant which was a nice surprise - must be great windows!
The restaurant provides a very nice breakfast - both continental or ala carte from a menu. I did have 1 lunch at the hotel which again was very nice although a bit pricey.  The restaurant's outside patio area is a great place for a drink in the evening. 
The fitness center is really small with 2 pieces of cardio equipment.  The pool is also very small, located on the roof with a handful of chairs and tables.  It's quite nice for sunbathing and you can order drinks and foods pool-side.  
My only minor issue experienced on this visit was the wifi reliability on the property and in the rooms.  The signal tended to vary in strength at-times going out completely.  This happened sporadically on the visit.
Overall I highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Barcelona.  It is on Gran Via but relatively quiet - centrally located within a short walk to all the major sights in the city.
I was really very pleased with the service and accommodation and would gladly stay at this property in the future.",5,2016,09,06
13,Quiet Barcelona oasis,"This is the hotel at which to stay if you are sensitive to noise. It is extremely quiet - there is no noise from the hallways (the doors are extra thick and padded), and no noise can be heard from above, below, or to the sides of the rooms.  However, there *is* some street noise which can be heard on the 2nd floor (which is like the 3rd floor in the US) in the suites overlooking the front of the hotel. It is possible that this noise is not audible from the suites on the higher floors - I did not get a chance to visit any other front-facing rooms. I was able, however, to visit (and actually switch) to rooms overlooking the rear of the hotel, and those rooms - at least on the 4th floor and above, were pin-drop quiet. When falling asleep at night, I felt like I was in a fabulous little cocoon. I wish I could have stayed longer!",5,2016,09,04
13,Bad surprise,"We spent two nights here, my family and I.

The hotel itself is very nice in a very convenient location.

However the service is very very poor. In a 5-star hotel (800 per room per night) you would expect they change the bed linens every day ... Unfortunately that was not the case, and also the bathroom towels were not replaced either ... Absolutely unacceptable.

At the check-out we mentioned this to the receptionist ... But no reaction ... Is that the common practice ?

",2,2016,09,03
13,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel in bustling section of the City.  5 star service and Rooms.  We had a balcony room overlooking the rear courtyard.  Lobby, lounge, bar and restaurant all had a luxury ""old world"" feel.  We stayed here for 3 days after a cruise.  Off the ship at 8am and of course the room was not ready (as we expected)  They held our bags and were very helpful in providing a map and directions for our planned tours.  The city is so large that I can't say this was the ""ideal location"" but the hotel was top notch.",5,2016,09,01
13,Superb - In each and every way,"This hotel is a must for anyone visiting Barcelona. The service is impeccable. Rooms are modern and spacious. Food and drink are second to none. Extremely helpful staff. Location is excellent to visit and navigate all the important sites of the city.
There is no other hotel you should consider. 

",5,2016,08,31
13,Loved this hotel!,"This hotel was 1 of our favorites throughout our entire trip in Spain!  It was modern, elegant, yet had the Spanish flair we were looking for.  Our room was bright, clean, and functional.  Its location is perfect--on a quite street right off of Passeig de Gracia.  The service from the front desk to the concierge was absolutely impeccable! Notably, the wonderful, fresh scent and cool air we breathed in whenever we entered the hotel lobby just felt so amazing after walking around all day.  They also have a really nice rooftop pool that's just perfect for lounging for a break from sightseeing.   I will definitely stay here again next time we're in Barcelona!",5,2016,08,31
13,Amazing!,This hotel is understated on the outside but such an old world jewel on the inside! /we were upgraded to one of the historic rooms and it was just an amazing room! We loved the bar with it's patio  and wonderful service...and the drinks were great too!!,5,2016,08,30
13,Wonderful Hotel with Terrific Staff,"We just loved the Marriott Cotton house hotel during our stay in late August 2016. 
The hotel is a small, boutique property in a  great location central to all the major tourist areas but not on top of them. The rooms are small, but well appointed, new and wonderful bedding and towels.
The staff is exemplarary! No question was a problem, no request an issue and always with a smile and genuine concern.

The only drawback we could see was that the food and drinks we very overpriced compared to the balance of Barcelona.

We would recommend this hotel!",5,2016,08,30
13,A really good hotel in all ways.,"A really good hotel in all ways.

I booked this hotel as it looked a little quirky on the Marriott web site but have to say I felt really pleased I did.

The hotel is brimming with character, the ambiance is fantastic and the service of the very highest order.

The rooms are relatively small but decorated to a very high standard, have the best air conditioning I think I have yet found, makes almost no noise but can do really cool if you want. The walk in wet room for shower and bath was a great touch and the balcony an unexpected extra (we were lucky to get an upgrade).

The main thing I will take away is the service excellence, the team are always present in enough quantity to ensure no one has to wait more than a minute or two and all are very keen to make sure everything goes well with your stay.

We were doing a city break so never did get to use the” mini pool” so cannot comment on that but I can say that it was nice that on arrival we were given a tour of the hotel so we knew what was where.

The restaurant was great, over thirty gins was a good sign, including top brands such as Plymouth, the food served promptly and of a very high standard both at dinner and breakfast (we did not do lunch as went out sightseeing).

If returning to Barcelona this would certainly be my first choice (have previously stayed at the Hotel Arts, the W and two of the Hiltons).",5,2016,08,29
13,Very Refined Hotel with. Great Location,"Very nice hotel. Felt as though I was in New Orleans. Try to get an upper floor. It is worth upgrading - cost me an extra 40 euros. The bed was very comfortable. Bath large enough for two and a rain shower next to the tub.

Drinks out side is delightful before dinner. Nice sitting area on the second floor.",5,2016,08,29
13,Charming Historical Hotel at a Great Location,"Stayed in this hotel for two nights and the Marriott brand definitely did not disappoint. The hotel is beautiful with a very vintage feel but fully equipped with modern facilities. The staff were all very friendly. Upon arrival, they offered a tour around the historic hotel which was a great start to my trip to Barcelona. The room was comfortable. Breakfast was great with a wide selection of food and drinks. Also had lunch on my last day here and the food and service was great - I had that octopus and it was a unique and delicious meal. The restaurant and garden terrace is extremely comfortable and gives a great feel of a top quality hotel and also the city. The location of this hotel was perfect. Was away from the crowds but walking distance to most attractions and the subway station. A few buses (from Plaza Espana / Las Arenas for example) even stops right in front of the hotel. The only thing that was below average for a 5 star hotel would be the housekeeping which I thought was a bit rushed but this would definitely not prevent me from going back to this hotel. And, the pool is small and one can't do laps there but still a great place to relax and enjoy the rooftop views of Barcelona (you could even see the Sagrada Familia) from there. I would highly recommend this hotel which is also value for money for a 5 star hotel. ",5,2016,08,29
13,Cotton House Stay,"Very nice hotel and well located! The rooms were very comfortable and well appointed. The staff were generally friendly, but not all of them were to the standards that should be expected for this type of hotel. The general manager came off as a bit condescending in my opinion and didn't follow through with a complaint that we had.",3,2016,08,28
13,Excellent service ,"Last week I had the pleasure to know the Cotton House Hotel as one of my friends was a guest at your hotel and we enjoyed the beautiful terrace for breakfast. The terrace is unique in Barcelona, even though the hotel is in the middle of the centre, it is an oasis of relaxation. The breakfast was spectacular, normally a hotel breakfast buffet is standard, however at Cotton House they pay special attention to the presentation and variety: amazing experience! I have been living in Barcelona for 9 years and know many hotels in the city, however the Cotton House Hotel is an unique hotel which stands out from the others with its amazing location close to the main shopping street, historical building and outstanding service! It feels good staying at an hotel where the hotel staff seem to enjoy working, always with a smile and everyone was really friendly and attentive at all times, even though the hotel must have been at its busiest. I am glad I finally got to know the hotel and will certainly repeat my visit and recommend it to others. Many thanks to all the staff for making my visit memorable and I will certainly come back!!
Kind regards, Helene",5,2016,08,28
13,Great central location,"What we liked: I'll start with the hotel being very nice. The rooms are very comfortable, a little small but cozy. The atmosphere is really nice. We often frequented the bar and sat outside on the 1st floor.

What could be better: inconsistent service at the restaurant...we had 3 different servers take our order and didn't communicate to each other before a fourth took over on day one...not good. Service is what gets you repeat business

On our last night, tonight, we ordered tomato bread and Iberian ham almost an hour ago and checked in it 3x and still have not had it served. Very disappointed...so late we decided to go back to our room

Too bad Nuri isn't here tonight because she gave us great service last night.

The concierge service was good, recommended some food restaurants. One had a great view but the food wasn't that great. Another was awesome!

Overall really nice hotel and perfect location...maybe just set expeditions with the staff when you order...
",4,2016,08,27
13,Excellent boutique in central Barcelona,"We discovered Cotton through an article in a travel magazine, who awarded it ""Best Design"" for new boutique hotels. Our expectations were high, and the Cotton met them. 

While the service was exceptional throughout, I was particularly impressed with the restaurant/bar and front door teams. 

The rooms are small (though well-appointed). There aren't many views, though all of Barcelona's architecture, color and culture is just outside the front door. ",5,2016,08,27
13,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is an old building that was where tailors met their clients way back in the day.
They have updated the building beautifully. Keeping a lot of the beautiful architecture while updating the rooms in a very modern and cool way.
Breakfast was included and it was very good. The hotel staff were really wonderful and the pool area is very nice. Small, but very nice. 
It is located close to everything, and very easy to get around from here to just about anywhere, either walking catching the metro or taxi.",5,2016,08,24
13,"Outstanding service, great facility",Stayed with my family in two connected room.  The hotel is very well located few minutes walk from Catalonia Square.  The renovation work done on the building is outstanding. The service was very attentive to all of our needs.  Breakfast terrace is just outstanding,5,2016,08,24
13,Hola Barcelona,"First time at the Cotton House Hotel. What a treat! Location could not be better. We had a wonderful room with a balcony and it was truly Barcelona at its best.  The hotel was beautiful and service was amazing.
If you are in Barcelona make the Cotton House Hotel your stay.",5,2016,08,22
13,Hot in Barcelona,Fabulous new hotel in an old building. Very cool look most comfortable beds ever. The location cant be beat right in the heart of everything. Wait till spring or fall the weather is to hot and humid in august.,5,2016,08,22
13,Gorgeous and Insta worthy! ,"From the minute we walked in I could not stop taking photos of this gorgeous eye candy of a hotel!  As far as finish out and design, this hotel is hard to beat.  I've stayed at some beautiful hotels, Meurice in Paris, Rome Cavalari, Hilton in Queenstown, Richard Branson's Casbah Tamadot and Cotton House has a place with all of the above.  The service and staff were top notch and very accommodating.  The lounge, bar, terrace are lovely and the food was a great.  So many details.  The rooms are small, but this is Europe and it's a renovated mansion.  The bathrooms were actually quite large and indulgent and we loved our little balcony over looking the terrace.  The rooftop pool is small but the views at sunset were amazing to have a sangria and view of Sagrada.  We stay at Hiltons and Marriotts often due to my husband being a world traveler and we will be back to Cotton House for sure.  Location is also great near Ramblas, shopping and only a 15 minute walk to Barri Gottic.",5,2016,08,21
13,A near perfect boutique hotel run by a chain,"This is a very striking property that seems just the right size to produce individualized attention in a full service hotel.  As other reviewers have noted, there's a young, energetic staff who go out of their way to  make you feel welcome.  We were given a tour of the hotel, which has an interesting history and and has been turned into a very comfortable property.  Our room looked over the hotel courtyard which housed an outdoor terrace for a restaurant with an appealing menu.  The size of the room is typical for a European hotel with a more generous bath area than one would expect and a balcony with a couple of chairs and a table.
As nice as the hotel is, the staff and it's location are the real stars.  There wasn't any question that was attacked with ingenuity and great follow up.  Many  of these young professionals were actually interns who are clearly well trained.  As for the location, we were able to comfortably walk to La Rambla, Familia Sagrada and the Arc L'Triomf and their ancillary attractions.  To get to more distant locations, we used the Hop On Hop Off 2 day passes to get a good overview and then to actually get us to our sightseeing destinations.",5,2016,08,21
13,Beautiful hotel in a convenient location,"I was a little concerned reading some of the reviews, but our stay ended up to be perfect.  We loved the hotel-the location absolutely can not be beat-walking distance to restaurants, sightseeing and the metro.  We needed a drug store and a convenience store while we were there and both were just around the corner.  We booked the Cotton Room, which was perfect for the two of us.  It wasn't huge, but we've certainly had smaller rooms in Europe.  And the bed was super comfortable.  We enjoyed the (mostly) young, enthusiastic staff-they offered us a tour of the hotel which we ended up doing on our own.  And we loved the breakfast-lots of choices including Red Velvet cake which I've never seen on a breakfast buffet before!  We will be back!",5,2016,08,20
13,Family Vacation,Beautiful hotel with spacious rooms that are well appointed. Only downside is that bathroom doors afford little privacy. Free buffet breakfast to elite Marriott members. Impeccably clean with lovely staff. Attached bar/restaurant has both indoor and outdoor options.,4,2016,08,18
13,Beautiful building in a central location,"My wife, teenage daughters and I stayed for five nights at the Cotton House Hotel in late July.  Our rooms were very comfortable and the hotel made a great base for exploring Barcelona.  The staff is very young (I don't think anyone was close to thirty years old), international and enthusiastic.  We appreciated the ever present cold glass of water in the lobby and the quick efforts by the bellmen to get a cab.  The majority of guests seemed to be cruise ship passengers in for a night at the start or end of a cruise. 

The concierge staff is helpful with basic questions; however their recommendations for restaurants and entertainment are limited to standard tourist destinations. For those seeking interesting restaurants or unique experiences, you should rely on Trip Advisor or tips from locals.  All in all we had a very nice stay at the Cotton House Hotel.",4,2016,08,16
13,I'm in shock ,"We arrived quite late and were looking forward our stay. We had booked King size bed. Once we arrived it turned out that they are out of rooms with King size beds (although we had already paid for one). They said that they'll provide us 3'rd level upgrade and guided into the room. It was a tiny little thing with twin bed :/ We dropped the room and demanded for a better one. They promised to fix it. We went for a late dinner instead, once back in the hotel they gave us the good news: they had sorted out room issue. 
We opened the door and it was even worse than the first one ! I was in a SHOCK ! It was night by that time already and all managers had left hours ago, so we were forced to accept that s****y room. Toilet hadn't been flushed and sink was in the hallway !!! I've never ever seen a sink in the hallway in a 5star hotel ! And the bed was far from King size - surprise surprise !!! 

All the other personnel was super friendly and professional ! Restaurant was good and we also enjoyed pool area but reception was awful! I'll never go back to that hotel if I can help it ...  ",2,2016,08,16
13,Great Hotel in a great spot!,"I was a little nervous about booking here because the good reviews were great and the bad reviews made me wonder if I should be staying here.  I was worried about the size of the rooms and the layouts in particular.  However, while the rooms were a little small, they were laid out quite nice.  The super high ceilings had a way of making the room seem bigger than it probably was.  

The service here was great though, they staff were amazing the whole time.  Also if you are worried about the location, don't.  The place is in a perfect spot where you can walk to anything.  

As other said, while the hotel is nice, I do worry about the finishes and how long they will last.  The floors seemed a bit cheap, again, they look great now, but will they in a few years?  I will let them worry about that though.  

Also, one final point, if you like a cold room the A/C here was insane!  I loved it!",5,2016,08,16
13,Outstanding experience and unforgettable stay!,"Outstanding experience and unforgettable stay!

I really love the historical building where this hotel is based! Highly recommended for its location, cozy atmosphere and wonderful staffs. The location is perfect, near to everywhere in the city center (shopping area, historical monuments, train station, metro, etc.), the staffs are very attentive and made me really feel like home, specially the handwritten warm welcome words in my mother language really impressed me a lot.

I stayed 3 nights in the Egyptian room at the 1st floor, the room has a small but lovely terrace where I spent good time working outside with the sunlight. The breakfast variety is excellent, I just can say, this hotel exceed my expectations and the experience here was extraordinary!

Everything you find here will just make you want to come back and stay again. I'm a very frequent business traveler, I'm pretty sure that I will be here very soon!",5,2016,08,15
13,Great Hotel with Questionable Finishes,"The Cotton House is a great hotel with truly beautiful common areas, and features an almost unparalleled breakfast location for the city. The staff are all extremely helpful, courteous, and, (worth noting) attractive. The rooms, albeit small, are configured in a way that utilizes the space efficiently, and are very aesthetically pleasing with beautiful lighting. However, it seems as if the hotel only went three-quarters of the way there in terms of its furnishings. While the rooms look nice, there are some glaring cost-cutting measures that evidently took place. The flooring seems cheap, and the desk and fridge both appear to not be solid wood as both have aged horrendously considering the property has been open for merely a year and a half (for example, the wood veneer on the minibar was flaking off, making it extremely hard to close, and our desk was covered in scratches). The bed, on the other hand, was very comfortable. Overall, this is a great hotel, one of the best in the city, but cheap finishes in the rooms lower one's perception of quality and luxury offered at the Cotton House.",4,2016,08,15
13,Unimpressed,"This hotel was not impressive for the prices charged.  The rooms are small and noise transmits easily from the rooms nearby.  I almost wonder if the walls were made of cotton.  High ceilings hide the compactness of the room until you try and move around.  Interior rooms have a view of air ducts and the walls of the adjoining building, and almost no sunshine.  The hotel is run by dozens of college-age Europeans who are unfamiliar with much of Barcelona to help guide you.  They are self-proclaimed ""interns"" in the hotel.  Given that this is a moderately priced hotel, I would have expected better service.  There was no benefit to being an elite Marriott member.
Other facilities include a rooftop with about 12 lounge chairs at the small pool, and gym the size of a closet with one elliptical machine, one sitting bicycle and some dumbbells without any room to really workout.
Breakfasts are not European style but 29 euros for a breakfast buffet, and they make it challenging to get the few items that they allow on an a la carte menu, if you do not want to gorge yourself on a buffet.  
It is the perfect example of an American-owned business taking  financial advantage of Americans traveling abroad.  My recommendation is to find another hotel to stay at and take a pass on the Cotton House.  There are plenty of options in Barcelona.",2,2016,08,15
13,Just wait a cotton picking minute!,"This was ABSOLUTELY more delightful than I thought it would be! 

This is my first stop in 20 day EuroTrip to celebrate my 40th birthday! I needed somewhere to stay that was nice, fresh and would energize me before I headed to the gargantuan Harmony of the Seas for a 7 day cruise then on to Paris, Amsterdam and London. My options were the W Barcelons, Hotel Arts and the Cotton House. To the likes of the fabulous AC Santo Mauro in Madrid, Spain, I chose the Cotton House. I was skeptical because of the reviews and seemingly small rooms displayed on the website, but I wasn't disappointed.

Really, truly, a room (to some) is just a place to rest between sightseeing. I am just really particular when it comes to personal space and big or small, I want everything I need. I used Marriott Rewards points to book a Cotton King with a balcony looking into the courtyard. The room is what you would expect in a boutique hotel. The color pallete and textures in the room were clean and inviting. Something about the white made it peaceful but when you turn on the lights, the yellow hues warmed it up. The rain shower being in a 'closet' with the tub was cute. 

The floating stairs. WOW. Just WOW. 

From the entry to the library to the Gossypium where you could make your own shirt, this hotel was like a plantation home you'd find in the French Quarter in Louisiana. 

I had dinner and breakfast at Batuat, the hotel restaurant. The food was very good and the service very attentive. 

I'll definitely return here when I can come back and see the city more. As it were, I only spent 2 nights in preparation for the cruise and my only sightseeing was to the Monastery in Montserrat (MUST go!).

13,This is the place to stay in Barcelona.,"A stunningly-beautiful hotel with outstanding service and in a great location. The hotel is an old mansion used in the cotton trade, expanded and updated into a wonderful hotel. The common areas are incredibly gracious and well-appointed, with furnishings that point to a rich past, but are also very current. The hotel rooms are tasteful studies in white, with tall ceilings and huge windows. The bathroom area is a study in effective use of space, and the showers are amazing. Internet is fast, and the concierge service is top-notch. The breakfast is amazing, and the outdoor dining area is in a quiet courtyard. Key tourist destinations are either an easy walk or short ride away, as are outstanding dining options. There is no better place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2016,08,12
13,Horrible  wi-fi,"The location is not bad, but not that great, depends on your expectations, search the map first.
Roof top swimming pool extremely small.
Rooms nice but small, clean. comfortable beds. 
Agree with the previous review  about nespresso coffee capsules.This is a joke, they give you 2 only ( hotel room costs 300-400E/night). Hint - walk to Pass de Gracia- there is nesspresso boutique there. Even worse, I asked for extra cream for coffee- never got more that 2 (really?), Ive never seen that anywhere in the world! simply cheap approach.
Water bottles every night very appreciated.
And the WORST IS WI-FI, so poor quality ( but free- this is what you get  for free here).

Overall, this is a BEAUTIFUL, stylish property, but guest service needs to get trained, needs a lot of improvement in customer service. 
Tried the restaurant once- average.
I don't think I would stay here again, however this hotel has a great potential.",3,2016,08,12
13,"Hotel experience was over all quite good, but the room was inadequate","The Hotel is very attractive and the tiny swimming pool is cute and refreshing if you happen to be able to fit inside it without crowding anyone else. The views from the roof are also attractive, and the outside breakfast was superb, as was the service. The beds in the room are comfortable, the rooms is quite clean, and modern, but the views on the roof top, at least in our room, were abominable. Our rooftop room had a view of A/C ventilators/transformer , basically a view of a wall. We are Marriott GOLD members and we asked for another room, but were told that the Hotel was sold out, and that was the only room  available. I think that Marriott normally offers its GOLD members better rooms, so that was very disappointing. The location is also excellent.",4,2016,08,11
13,A choice for a boutique hotel in Barcelona,"Overall we had a very good experience at this hotel.  We stayed here the night before departed on a cruise.  This a very nice boutique hotel with a great location.  Very easy to get to from the airport and to go to the cruise terminal.  I was pleased to see they honored the room upgrade as I am Marriott Gold member. Other pros: front desk service, hotel ambiance, rooftop pool, outdoor bar. 

There were some cons though. I would not recommend using the car service. We had baggages issues arriving into Barcelona and when I asked if they could return in a couple of hours after we received our bags from a later flight, I was told I would be charge the full fare again (over 200 Euros - 100 for the first attempt and another 100 for the second attempt). No thanks, we took a cab which was just as easy and only 30 Euros.  The hotel gives give 2 Nespresso pods for the in room coffee (1 reg and 1 decaf). The problem is there is a large sign that says if you want more it will cost 3 Euros a piece. As previously stated, I stay at Marriotts over 50 times per year and have never seen that before. For what you pay for a room you shouldn't be charged for extra coffee. Lastly, the breakfast was completely disorganized. It was a nice spread but there was not a hostess or wait staff. It seemed like it was just their regular staff trying to run a restaurant. The was lots of confusion and it wasnot very orderly. It was a shame because it has lots of potential. 

Despite the last critiques, it was overall a good experience. If they fix these issue they could compete with the other exclusive hotels in Barcelona.  ",4,2016,08,07
13,Beautiful hotel in a great location with small rooms,"I am surprised this is an Autograph Hotel for Marriott with the size of the rooms. Rooms are too small but common by old European standards. Wonderful first floor library and restaurant. Food is good or bad. I had one meal of each. Smoking on the terrace can be a little too much. If you have a room with a balcony you have cigarette and cigar smoke creeping into your room if you open the sliding glass door during terrace hours. They need to work on ventilation for the terrace and balcony room guests. Friendly staff. Overpriced for what you get and not compared to similar properties in Paris, London, NYC, San Francisco or New Orleans. This is not a five star hotel. A want a be.",3,2016,08,06
13,Nice Hotel in a Great Location,"This hotel feels great the moment you walk in.  The staff up front were excellent.  If I could replicate the beds and the robes my wife would be beyond happy!  The rooms are of modest size, but nicely appointed.  The location is easily walk-able to most of the places you will want to go (as a tourist)....we taxied in, and proceeded to walk almost everywhere (including the beach...although a bit further).  The service at breakfast left a bit to be desired, the gym and pool are tiny..but otherwise a great choice.",5,2016,08,03
13,Love this hotel!,"This hotel was wonderful from beginning to end. The rooms are on the small side but quite luxurious. The beds are amazingly comfortable and the rooms have plenty of amenities included. I was with a group of 14& we all loved this hotel. It is centrally located , and the staff will help you to arrange transportation or sightseeing.
We did not eat anything other than breakfast at the hotel... The Breakfast was very good. We did have cocktails at the outdoor bar... Which is filled with comfortable couches and chairs... We enjoyed the vibe and the drinks. Would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2016,08,03
13,Lovely Hotel,The Cotton House is a lovely boutique hotel in an outstanding location. You can easily walk to everything from here. The rooms are nicely appointed with gorgeous linens. We had drinks and a light meal in the restaurant one evening. The outdoor setting was delightful and the young man who waited on us was outstanding. We had drinks on the rooftop one afternoon and loved being able to take pictures of the entire city. The entire front staff of this hotel was very accommodating and very professional. We enjoyed our stay in this very beautiful hotel.,5,2016,08,02
13,Excellent service but not the greatest hotel,"The rooms are extremely small in this hotel which makes it very uncomfortable.  The prices are high for what they offer.  Amenities are fine, they make sure everything is taken care of in the rooms.  Service is great throughout the hotel, the restaurant is very beautiful and has good food. It is a boutique hotel, don't forget that.  We tried to go to the pool, it was a joke. Never seen anything like that, looked like kid's pool for 5 people, walked out immediately.",3,2016,08,02
13,Best of Barcelona,"A boutique gem of a hotel in the Eixample area close to all the interesting tourist spots.  It's an easy walk to old town, Sagrada Familia, and Las Ramblas.  The rooms are tidy with lux furnishings, an incredibly comfortable bed, excellent a/c, in room coffee maker, flat screen tv, plenty of light, plush bathrobes, etc...

The hotel has done an outstanding job of keeping the old cotton house feel of the original building while providing sleek, contemporary, luxurious rooms and  beautiful, cozy public spaces.

Staff was wonderful and attentive.  

The terrace is a lovely spot for breakfast or for evening cocktails.  Don't miss their special cocktails made with real colloidal silver!",5,2016,08,01
13,Beautiful Hotel and Wonderful People,"Highly recommend for a romantic and pampered get away. Short walk to shops, great food, and sights. Quite cool oasis. Outstanding history and very well maintained. Outdoor eating and relaxing area to enjoy the sunshine and quiet. Rooms have all the amenities in a beautiful classic decor. ",5,2016,08,01
13,Nice hotel... Enjoyable stay.,"Spent 6 nights at the Cotton House.  We were concerned about the location, but it ended up being in a perfect location for us.  Even though our room faced Gran via de les Corts Catalanes, we did not hear the street noise.  The hotel has good access to shopping and the restaurants in Eixample, and it was an easy walk to Sagrada Famillia, Arc de Tromp, El Born, Barri Gotic and of course Las Ramblas.  Our stay included breakfast, which was good.  Breakfast was a nice continental.  If you wanted eggs and bacon, that came at a small surcharge.  The fresh juices were really good, and the service excellent.   We went to the 2nd floor patio a couple times for pre dinner drinks, and it was really relaxing.  (Europcar is also just down the street if you need a car rental).  All the staff at the Cotton House were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were bright white, comfortable, and clean.  This hotel has some nice old European character.  ",4,2016,07,30
13,"Impressive, indeed.","I was in Barcelona on business and the Cotton House Hotel was truly wonderful. My room was ready when I arrived and the staff was excellent. (Suffice to say, their English language skills far surpass my Spanish.) The whole time I was there, I was greeted warmly and made to feel like I was coming home. My room was nice and well-appointed. I overlooked the Gran Vila, yet it was still quiet. The restaurant and outdoor seating area was splendid. The hotel is located in a part of the city that makes it easy to walk, grab a cab, or hop the subway to all the major attractions. For me, the Cotton House is a place I will definitely being staying in again. Check it out if you're in Barcelona.",5,2016,07,30
13,Perfect Location...Maybe Perfect in Every Way,"The efficient and friendly staff here made our stay in Barcelona even more enjoyable.  Our room was well appointed, super clean, modern and had a nice view.  The historical value of this property was very interesting and I enjoyed spending some time just exploring the property.

Breakfast was full of choices to satisfy pretty much anyone...the house baked pastries were delicious.  Whether dining in the lovely indoor area or drinks on the calm and cool outdoor space, you couldn't go wrong.  Cooling off in the pool provided a nice break from sightseeing.  

I only wish we could have stayed longer than four days.  I'm pretty sure I could move in and stay all summer.",5,2016,07,30
13,A room with no view,"I had to spend there few days with my wife as other hotels fully booked. I must admit that the reception was lovely but, only that. We had a room with no view, just another wall in front of us. Did not like it.  Though the staff and the cherry at the entrance were very nice. We would not go back.",3,2016,07,30
13,A gem of a hotel in a gem of a ciy,"This is now my ""go to"" hotel whenever I am able to get to one of my favorite cities in Europe. It is centrally located in the heart of the city, just up the street from the Palace Hotel, so many attractions (including Segrada Familia and Las Ramblas) and many good places to eat are within walking distance. It is a Marriott Autograph Collection 5-star hotel with beautiful architecture and a warm, cozy luxurious atmosphere. It was once the home of a textile baron, hence the name Cotton House.

All of the rooms are modern and well appointed but some standard rooms are small by American (but not European) standards.  The suites are excellent and the special ones, like the Damasco suite (Room 104), which was once the master bedroom of the original family owners and which I got to stay in as a courtesy upgrade) are spectacular. Thank you Cotton House for the awesome upgrade!

I cannot say enough good things about the staff. A hotel is not just about accommodations -- people make a big difference. Everyone I met was enthusiastic and eager to help. Special thanks to the reception staff and the concierge who were simply outstanding.  The restaurant in the hotel is very good and recommended. Excellent breakfast, so a meal I often skip I did not skip here.

I highly recommend you give this hotel a try. As another reviewer has said, this is a hotel ""with soul"".  I look forward with delight to staying here again on my next and any opportunity to visit Barcelona.",5,2016,07,29
13,Superb hotel,"How to describe how great it was this top experience. Just to indicate the better could be difficult to get.
Breakfast was extremely good, wonderful flavours and preparations.
And the best, the attention from all personnel of the hotel.

This is a 100% recommended hotel for pleasure in BCN.
",5,2016,07,29
13,"Comfy room, outstanding breakfast, nice enough pool.","The main advantage we found was the willingness and competence of the staff to follow through. This can be a problem while traveling. If you need your hotel to get things right while you're in this region of Spain, this hotel will look after you.  

Additionally, the rooms are charming and contemporary. The food is top notch.  The building is something of a living museum. Housekeeping is exceptional. 

It's a great property.",5,2016,07,28
13,Bad wifi,"This hotel is a lovely place in a privileged area of Barcelona. They have a lovely lobby, restaurant and garden terrace. The team of young professionals is well trained, although made a few mistakes.

The room was nice although I could never get the AC to work in the temperature desired. I was freezing at night and called reception to be informed that I could not control the AC from my room. They adjusted it downstairs and told me they would call me back to check it out in 25 min. They never called. The room then got very hot. I had to call them back and it became a hassle.

But the big problem of the hotel is the WIFI or the lack of it. It does not cover the entire hotel and I had to move tables at breakfast to get a signal. The speed was extremely slow and I got constantly disconnected. It was impossible to work remotely.

",3,2016,07,27
13,Very nice and stylish ambiance,". The entrance of the emblematic building is a beautiful Hall with mirrors an access to two stairways: one, a grand marble staircase, and the other, a spiral staircase built in the 50's. The old noble areas of the building have an elegant library, several living rooms  and lounges where the bar and restaurant are located, a luminous glass conservatory and a 300 sqm terrace with stylish tables, umbrellas, outdoor furniture areas. Really beautiful at night. 
The German chef does a good job too.",5,2016,07,26
13,Marriott's Cotton House in Barcelona,"This is a great hotel close to everything.  It is walking distance to a lot of sights and only a short taxi ride to many more.  The hotel is old, but the accommodations are quite nice.  It has a restaurant and nice patio seating.  There is a small outdoor pool; great for sunning oneself or cooling off.  The staff is very cordial and helpful.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a pleasant, quiet, and quaint hotel and close to the action.",5,2016,07,25
13,Cotton House,"My wife and I stayed at the Cotton House for four nights in late June.  What an enjoyable experience.  It was a perfect location.  Having not been to Barcelona before we were not sure about which part of Barcelona to stay in. The hotel is close enough to walk to most of the main sights, and important to us, off of the Las Ramblas.  A fantastic breakfast and excellent staff added to an make this a great stay.  I travel a bit, and have a rather high bar.  This hotel exceeded our expectations.",5,2016,07,25
13,Top notch,"I travel a lot and stay at many hotels. The amazing thing about this place is that it has something very few other hotels have: it has soul. Incredible staff, amazing atmosphere, great food and drinks, and an impeccable attitude. It's really one of the very few hotels that are actually nice to just hang out in! Kudos to the entire staff and management. ",5,2016,07,22
13,Great hotel,"I stayed with friends at the hotel in July 2016. The hotel was really great, very interesting and different decor. Rooms were very comfortable and the entire hotel staff was very friendly and professional, making us feel welcome. The rooftop pool has a great view and even if it's not too big,  it's still very relaxing and enjoyable experience. ",5,2016,07,21
13,"Superb hotel, excellent service","Very good location just off Placa de Catalunya within walking distance to both Passeig de Gracia and La Rambla. What really sets this hotel apart is the fine mix of luxury furnishings set in a historic building and staffed by well-trained and eager to please staff. The overall experience elevates this hotel beyond 5 star.

I was given a room at first without a long bath, but as my wife had a recent operation for her knee, she needed a hot soak after walking the whole day to release the muscle tension. To the credit of the hotel manger Serge, he managed to find us a room despite the hotel being full and kept the room till the next evening after we returned from the day's activities. We hurriedly packed our belongings into the suitcase and when we returned after dinner, our belongings were transferred to the new room with the long bath. Unfortunately the fridge was not working, but after I left word with the front desk, it was promptly fixed. The concierge deserves special mention. Their enthusiastic service finding restaurants, transportation, tours and tickets removed much of the hassle of planning our own way. There was a young man (I think he was Yunis, but I'm sorry if I got it wrong) who was especially helpful and quick with his computer. The front desk staff were also superb. I was late for a dinner appointment and there was no taxi outside, so the front desk staff walked to the end of the street to hail a taxi for me! Even Serge walked out to bring a taxi for us on our last day.

The dining room is beautiful, set in a greenhouse with plants and natural light. Paid with a  bountiful buffet, it is the perfect setting for breakfast.

A very lovely and memorable experience. I would definitely return if I have a chance.",5,2016,07,21
13,you won't be sorry,"The Cotton House
is a comfortable, stylish, artful and welcoming place to stay when in Barcelona. And you can use your Marriott points there!  It is a boutique hotel recently created in an old Cotton Brokerage.  Paying tribute to the historic building’s past, a dining room’s walls are lined with bolts of pastel cottons behind glass doors, a sitting room has displays of cotton brokers wares, and cotton - branches - images - references are tastefully placed throughout.  While our room was spacious, elegantly appointed and had the “always appreciated” Marriott quality bedding, it was the rooftop terrace that was our favorite feature.  It was a candlelit, warm comfortable spot for a drink in the evenings, with an exceptionally friendly and talented bar tender whose specialty is a chocolate martini (not to be missed).  By morning, a complimentary breakfast buffet that looked like something out of a magazine was enjoyed there.  If we ever have the good fortune to visit Barcelona again, there will be NO question as to where we will be staying.",5,2016,07,18
13,Great boutique hotel!,"When you first walk in you can see the history of the building and know it will be special.  We were greeted by Alonzo who was an outstanding tour guide if the property and very knowledgeable speaking excellent English.  The history is left at the room door as when you enter the room you find a well appointed room for Europe.  It was quiet, the air conditioning worked extremely well and all the appointments were top notch. The bed was extremely comfortable and the wifi super fast.  We even had a small balcony that overlooked the back terrace area of the restaurant and bar, it was very peaceful in the morning.  The property is walking distance to everything you want to see in Barcelona and only a couple blocks from two Metro stations.  When we come back we will stay here.",5,2016,07,17
13,Gem of a hotel,"This hotel is truly a gem. What really stood out to me was the staff. I have stayed at many nice hotels but the Cotton House staff was better than most.  Everyone was very friendly and inviting and always took the time to check on your stay.  We utilized Marriott Rewards and were still upgraded to a room that was a bit bigger and got the included breakfast as a Platinum Elite, which was really nice. It was actually a very nice tranquil way to start the morning having breakfast and sitting on their beautiful terrace. 

The rooms were also nice and very comfortable.  We had a room facing the street and heard virtually no noise. 

For me when I leave a hotel, and I feel like I would spend a bit more money to stay at that hotel than a similar hotel around the corner.....I know I had a good experience!",5,2016,07,16
13,"If in Barcelona, stay here! ","I'm a Marriott Platinum member and stay anywhere between 50-75 nights per year (for the last 4 years) at Marriott properties on business. I'm very familiar with the Marriott brand and know what to expect at all of the properties (including Autograph). 

Now, the experience at the Cotton House was absolutely unique and in a way, unexpected. Not because of the great location, not because of the beautiful, restored building nor the rooftop pool nor the bar, but because of your staff!!

From check-in to check-out it was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Room not ready because we showed up too early? ""No problem, we will hold your bags and call you when it's ready"" .... By the time we had a glass of water and a brownie and Marina gave us a tour of the property...our room was ready. Upgraded. Room 202!!

Sonia, Marina, Alonzo (I'm hoping I got the names right) and all of the staff (from front to back) always had a smile, greeted my wife and I by name and always (always) asked if there was anything they could do to improve our stay. It's almost strange, but every time we came back into the hotel from walking about, it felt like home. Your staff is responsible for creating that ambiance. Superb job!

I've never written a nice note (nor complaint) in any of my stays but I had to this time. Please share this feedback with your staff; customer service MAKES LOYAL CUSTOMERS. I'm one of them and from now on, business or pleasure, Cotton House is my house in Barcelona. 

Una cosa más - todo el personal se refiere al hotel como si fuera su propiedad; ""renovamos el hotel"" ""abrimos, adquirimos la propiedad"" ""gracias por hospedarse con nosotros"". Es obvio que han hecho un buen trabajo de ""branding"" y por eso, otra vez les felicito. 
",5,2016,07,13
13,One night pre-cruise,"We booked this property because of favourable reviews and also as I am a Marriott gold member.  
It was a perfect decision as I can not say anything negative about our stay.  From the moment we arrived the staff were professional and courteous in every interaction from the doorman/bellhop to the cleaning staff.  Our room was clean and fresh and the view from the sixth floor rooftop was excellent. The bed sucked us right in and the room was quiet. After a nine hour fight and a day of sightseeing we had a great sleep. 
We had the Marriott buffet breakfast which had way too may choices. 
I have only one complaint and that is my decision to only stay one night. We hope to come again and next time I will be certain to stay longer. ",5,2016,07,12
13,Terrific jewel in center of barcelona,"This hotel has only been open afew months so it's relatively unknown. A renovated private home with original floors and staircases. Hard to believe it is part of the Marriott chain. A boutique hotel feel, outdoor restaurant, personalized service with a smile. Clean ,fresh, and superb all around.",5,2016,07,12
13,So Glad We Chose Cotton House,"We've always had great results with Autograph Hotels, and in Barcelona Cotton House didn't disappoint.  Luxurious room by European standards, great central location, and the staff is excellent.  The restaurant also made a great choice when we didn't want to go out.We have really enjoyed wrapping up in the evenings with drinks on the outdoor patio (pictured).",5,2016,07,11
13,"Great stay, fantastic design, lovely staff","Great stay, with top honours to the design team. The public areas are lovely, blending old world and contemporary design in a seamless way. The restaurant has a lovely patio, there is also a small rooftop pool and bar. Breakfasr was great, if not exceptional. The room was light, all done up in shades of white. Staff were young, close at hand, welcoming and knowledgable. The concierge arranged a good wine tour at just 12 hours notice. Maybe the final sevice flourishes of a top city luxury hotel are missing, but the upside of that is a very inviting and informal atmosphere. The location is great, bridging Eixample and the old town. Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,10
13,You will enjoy one of the best place in Barcelona,"This is one of the most amazing place in Barcelona. Exclusive hotel gives you special atmosphere from the first entrance. Specific smell, old style but new furniture, very delicious resteraunt, bar at open veranda is something you have try. With one word you will never forget your time at this place. ",5,2016,07,10
13,Fantastic!,"I can't overemphasize how nice this hotel is. A former palace that was transformed into the offices of the Cotton Buyers and finally a hotel. Loaded with history,, beautiful decor and fantastic location. It was much more than we expected.

We only spent one night here following our cruise but it was perfect. We checked in very early but the staff checked us in and then held our bags while we went out and toured Barcelona. When we returned we were shown our room and bags were delivered very quickly.

Our room was spacious, luxurious and very comfortable. The bed was comfortable, room was clean and bathroom spotless. Always a plus with my wife!",5,2016,07,09
13,Beautifully restored hotel offering rest and relaxation in the heart of the city,"Great location, assiduous staff and a beautifully restored building; the perfect ingredients for a wonderful stay.  My partner and I stayed at the Cotton House for my birthday in June and it was a lovely treat.  The room wasn't the largest in the world, but extremely luxurious and, as one would expect given the name of the hotel, the linens were exemplary.  We only stayed one night as we were travelling on to other parts of Spain, so a good location for easy access to areas of interest was key.  We were not disappointed as the hotel is well located and we were able to walk to all of the areas we wanted to see.  

Why did we enjoy this hotel so much, despite our brief stay?  The location was ideal, the staff were friendly and couldn't do enough to ensure our stay was enjoyable and the design of the hotel was stunning.  Our favourite moment was enjoying a drink in the hotel's garden terrace bar restaurant which is an oasis in the city.  Sublime.

One night was not enough.  We will definitely be back.",4,2016,07,09
13,"Great Location, Great Hotel!","My husband and I stayed 1 night after a cruise.  The hotel is centrally located, making it easy to reach all that sites.  The staff is TERRIFIC! We arrived early and they were happy to store our luggage and lock our valuables in the hotel safe.  When we returned from a tour of Barcelona the staff had put our luggage in the room. The room itself was very comfortable and a terrific end to an extended vacation. 

The rooftop terrace area is welcoming and we enjoyed tapas/drinks there in the afternoon. Breakfast in the morning was extensive...you ordered a hot dish (eggs) and there was a huge buffet with fruit, yogurts, cheese, meat and pastries.

Special kudos to Olga, the concierge - my husband forgot his expensive suit jacket in the tour company's van.  Olga made arrangements for shipping it back to the US. 

Wish we had more than 1 night - we'll definitely return to the hotel the next time we're in Barcelona!",5,2016,07,08
13,Delightful stay in a great area,The staff treated us wonderfully and our room was excellent.  Our rate included the breakfast which was all we needed or desired.  Very nice location--close to many of the big sights and easy to reach the rest by the subway stop close by.  Would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat.,5,2016,07,07
13,Here is Barcelona's oasis and it's exactly like nothing else,"The Cotton House Hotel is simply beautiful, excellently located on one of the city's most central streets and just a few blocks from Passeig de Gràcia. Its staff are so helpful, greeting you with smiles and impeccable service and it is a unique gem in the middle of Barcelona with a stunning restaurant and outdoor terrace. Their bespoke concierge service, Gossypium, really sets this hotel apart and their enthusiasm for making sure their guests have the best experience makes for an unforgettable stay. The rooftop pool is also the perfect addition to its multitude of services. 
Architecturally inspiring, it is not only a beautiful setting but also a historical one, built on the site of the old Cotton cooperation.  The rooms are stunning, particularly those with a view of the 1st floor terrace and are very well-equipped.  You would be hard pressed to find a better and more beautiful hotel than the Cotton House in Barcelona. ",5,2016,07,05
13,"Beautiful hotel, thoughtfully renovated hotel","My husband and I loved the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona -- it's a former association building for cotton manufacturers in the old textiles district, and the renovation has preserved many special touchesthat pay tribute to the building's past, like a huge display of cotton blossoms in the lobby and small reams of textiles in glass display shelves instead of books in the old library.  This is a beautiful hotel that feels both historic and clean and fresh.  Great location -- easy walk to La Rambla, the Gothic Quarter, and Ravel.  About 30 minute walk to the pier.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,07,05
13,Great Marriott Partner in Barcelona,"Always hit and miss with the Marriott Autograph partners on the continent - this was a hit. Room was on smaller side, but bathroom was completely modernized with walk-in overheat shower and no issues with temperature or pressure. Morning spread was (Marriott Gold) was good, not exceptional, but with tea / coffee / juice personal service from uniformed staff that also provided tips and tricks for local attractions. 
Everything interesting in Barcelona is within walking distance from this hotel. For Parc Guell, the subway stop is down the street and you are three stops away. La Rambla about 2-3 blocks and Sagrada Familia about 15-20 min walk.",5,2016,07,04
13,Outstanding hotel ,"My husband was in town for business and I was visiting for a few days of vacation. This hotel was not only beautiful, but very large rooms with open terrace windows. Great location, within walking distance to the marketplace, gothic quarter and shopping district. Fantastic service, this Marriott is unlike other hotels.. A must see! ",5,2016,07,03
13,Awesome food and drinks ,Awesome food and drinks. Really excellent place to hangout at the terrance. Surprisingly good food. Drinks were definitely awesome. Lobster on flat bread was my favorite. Both cava and whiskey sour were good too. Lots of plants and palm trees around.,5,2016,07,03
13,Very homy and cozy hotel,"Cotton house is perfect hotel for travellers who don't hurry and love relaxing atmosphere. Very friendly and polite personnel. Very stylish hotel each detail is especial and very creative. Rooms are light and cozy. I enjoyed staying. 

P.S. and unforgettable cotton smell in lounge room)) love it",4,2016,07,01
13,The best,"Everything about Cotton House is remarkable, unique and outstanding  - staff, rooms views. An incredibly special place with lovely people, the most beautiful rooms and an environment which feels glamorous, relaxed and happy. We dream to return one day.",5,2016,06,29
13,Great Hotel with a lot of history,"I loved this hotel.  The location is fantastic.  You can walk to just about anywhere.

The history and design of the hotel is great.

We upgraded to a room with a balcony.  This room was very quiet, with great views into the courtyard.",5,2016,06,27
13,Be careful!,"This is a nice hotel.  Staff is young, friendly, yet stiff.  I used points for two rooms for my family of five.  Reservations were made  last fall. During check-in I was told repeatedly that it was impossible to make a reservation for points for 5 people.  The up-sell incurred with me paying over 500 Euros to stay. My kids were on one floor in a nice room, one bed and a sofa bed. My wife and I, in a glorified cigar box of a room, double bed, nice bathroom, 2 floors away.
My expectations for the rooms were not met considering how many points I surrendered. I've been a Marriott (Platinum Elite) member since 1989 and Marriott Vacation member (President level).  Breakfast was good, expensive.
I have always counted on Marriott to do the right thing.  This did not happen here and clouded a very nice stay in a beautiful, vibrant city.  Families! Think twice before unloading points to this level! ",4,2016,06,25
13,Great hotel - but I need to mention the rooftop pool area,"We are regular visitors to Barcelona and decided to stay here for the first time for four nights. The hotel is absolutely stunning, it's in a great central location, rooms are spacious and the service in the hotel was fantastic. Generally I can't fault a thing and would recommend staying however, it's worth mentioning the rooftop pool area in a little more detail. The area in reality is actually very small. The pool itself is a long thin pool that realistically can only accommodate one person swimming in it at a time. Sunbed wise there is only around 12 beds TOTAL which all get taken up very quickly. The area is so small that it is a squeeze to get past the front of the beds and the pool. Two people want walk past each other at the same time that's for sure. There's then a general seating area which has two half circle couches and a few stools. These can also get taken up quickly and are not that great unless you want to sit around generally for a few short minutes. There's then a tiny bar that much of the time didn't seem to be attended by staff which was puzzling. As I said I would absolutely stay in this hotel again and would highly recommend it HOWEVER, if you are looking to book this because of the allure of a pool area and hoping to relax and sunbathe you might want to consider your options.",4,2016,06,24
13,Luxury in the Heart of Barcelona,"This hotel is extremely comfortable, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food and wine is excellent.  The hotel has some history.  It was originally a house.  Tons of character and stories that the staff are willing to share.  Everything about this place was better than expected, except the internet was horrible.  Fortunately, friends were staying across the street at the Indigo and I was able to take care of pesky work matters quickly each morning and evening in their lobby using their WiFi.

The location of this hotel is very central to everything you'll want to do in Barcelona.  I would return.",4,2016,06,23
13,Nice hotel and locale. Not best service. ,Staying here now. Beautiful property and rooms for Europe. Service lacking. Bar closed by 12 pm. Pool bar not even open today. Courtyard was closed for breakfast yesterday. CAnt get service. Asked for some but they never came. Kids were in the room during service hours yesterday. Asked to have room cleaned afterwards. They never did. Also had to request 3 times for a king to be switched to two twins. Aside from this a great property. ,4,2016,06,21
13,AMAZING HONEYMOON HERE!,"The end of our honeymoon cruise took us to Barcelona and we stayed at the Cotton House for 2 nights.  The hotel was gorgeously historic!  VERY well maintained and great service!  We checked in early as our cruise docked at 9am and decided to explore the city a little.  While we were out, the hotel staff placed a bottle of wine with little desserts in our room for our honeymoon.  It was so sweet!  The bed was so comfortable (pillows could have been firmer).  We had their continental breakfast each morning and they had some great freshly squeezed juice available.  This hotel is also very centrally located to shopping and restaurants and we walked everywhere.  LOVED this hotel!!",5,2016,06,15
13,Great hotel and great location.,Beautiful hotel just off the La Rambla.  Lovely rooftop terrace with a pool.  The history about the hotel is very interesting.  It has a lovely restaurant and bar.  The staff was very helpful with everything. We'd stay  here again.,5,2016,06,13
13,June visit,"Stayed here with some colleagues. The staff was friendly, the hotel is beautifully decorated, the drinks at the bar are fun and fresh, and the breakfast offerings are amazing!!!    The rooms are exceptional, loved the bed, the sheets and the towels in the bathroom are fantastic. Look forward to staying here again. ",5,2016,06,13
13,Beautiful elegant hotel,We went for dinner to this hotel and enjoyed the décor and ambiance.  Lovely hotel in a great location.  Will definitely stay on the next visit.  Lovely colonial vibe in the hotel and outside.  Don't miss it.  ,5,2016,06,13
13,Simply the best .....,"On our southern Euro-tour we stayed at six countries in 19 different hotels from four figure costs per night in Venice down.  Cotton House was the best from the time of arrival to departure.  The Reception team was welcoming from parking our RHD car (thanks to their driver who's worked with F1 drivers so RHD was no problem at all!), bar and restaurant service and its location that's handy for many of the sights of the city.  On departure I eventually (all good fun) got my credit card back from the charming receptionist and our car also had a couple of bottles of water and some cotton flowers.  No issues, 10/10 and we'd certainly recommend and use Cotton House again - the most helpful, efficient and charming efficient staff we've encountered for a long time!",5,2016,06,12
13,Very nice hotel and excellent staff,"though the staff all seem too young to drive- Younes the Concierge was 19- they are very helpful and energetic.

The hotel is quiet, has great beds and shower size, nice buffet and library, and is centrally located.",5,2016,06,12
13,Well appointed & decorated!,"I debated booking this hotel until I happened upon an article in a national interior design magazine that sung its praises. Indeed, the hotel met all expectations. Tasteful decor gives a nod to the hotel's history as a fine fabric manufacturing house. As a boutique hotel, the staff is polite and discrete. We especially enjoyed the morning breakfast service (do opt for the breakfast included package). The hotel room was a bit small by American standard, but the ""shower room"" was a treat and the beds were luxurious and cozy comfortable!  Lovely!",5,2016,06,09
13,Beautiful hotel,"This hotel is very well done and a comfortable place to stay.  The only issue we had was getting service in the restaurant.  After waiting for a while, we just decided to leave.  Also, I agree with another reviewer that it is a little pricey.",4,2016,06,08
13,Amazing,"I stayed here for four days.  From the moment I arrived, everything was completely taken care of. Everyone from the front desk to the maids were pleasant and welcoming. The patio outside the restaurant was amazing and the pool area relaxing.  It is apparent the staff takes pride in the hotel and the service they provide.  I would completely recommend staying here.  The breakfast buffet had a little bit of everything and a great way to start a morning sightseeing.  I essentially walked everyday using the hotel as my starting point - all the major sightseeing attractions are within walking distances. However the subway and bus stops are close by if you prefer.  

All and all - one of the better Marriotts I have stayed at.",5,2016,06,06
13,Lovely boutique hotel in great location!,"We stayed here the night before a Mediterranean cruise and had a great experience.  We used Marriott rewards points (plus a few euros to have windows!) so the price was great.  There were 4 of us so we had to book two rooms.

The front desk staff was wonderful to work with, the rooms were clean and very posh with really comfy beds.

The bathroom set-up is kind of weird.  There's a room for the toilet that opens into the bedroom-no biggie.  But the shower opened directly into the bedroom and there was no way to get in and adjust the temperature without flooding the floor!  The sink was in the bedroom on the other side of a half partition so no privacy from the bedroom.

Breakfast was really tasty and check out was smooth and easy.

Great location-easy walking distance to great restaurants and Las Ramblas. I'd highly recommend the hotel!",5,2016,06,06
13,"Excellent hotel, but rooms are on the pricey side","The staff were great.  The public spaces of the hotel are very nicely done.  The lobby and library oozes old world charm with contemporary touches.  The restaurant's decor was also very nice and we very much enjoyed starting out our mornings with breakfast there. 

We had an Egyptian Cotton room on the second floor courtyard above the outdoor restaurant.  The room was large by European standards with with a small sitting area and a little private balcony.   Overall, the room was tastefully done and we enjoyed it very much.  The bathrooms are very nice. The climate control works well.  However, considering the premium price they charge (note, breakfast is not included), the room was not quite five star because: (1) much of the furniture is pretty mid-range and some of it was worn (2) running water can occasionally be heard through the walls (although it did not bother us at night)   (3) the wireless did not work in our room (in other parts of the hotel it was great).  We were pleasantly surprised that the soundproofing to the outside was very good and the outdoor restaurant terrace could not be heard.

We would certainly recommend this hotel because of the location, staff and the overall hotel experience.",4,2016,06,06
13,Amazing!,"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The most attentive and helpful staff throughout the hotel. The staff were lovely to our 13 year old daughter and made our stay so enjoyable. Brilliant!
The hotel was very close to the local attractions and on a bustling street. We ate in the restaurant on two nights and the food was excellent also catering for our daughters tastes.
Beautiful terrace outside and pretty roof terrace for sunbathing.",5,2016,06,05
13,"Great Service, Great Location in the heart of Barcelona!","If you love grand old hotels with plenty of character this is the place to stay!
We arrived very early in the morning off the Carnival Vista cruise ship to stay overnight in Barcelona.  The location was a quick cab ride from the cruise port.  Our room was not yet available, however they quickly checked all our items for the day and brought us to the concierge desk to get us on our way to see the city.  It was a short walk to the Hop on Hop Off tour bus and we were able to see the beautiful city!  The Cotton House is within a quick walk to many shops and restaurants.  Our room was spacious and had a great bathroom with plus towels.  After dinner when we arrived back at the hotel we sat on their lovely patio for wine and great conversation with the staff!  I highly recommend this hotel!  I was lucky enough to use Marriott points for my stay!",5,2016,06,05
13,Fantastic hotel in a magical city,"The incredible service provided and gorgeous surroundings make this a wonderful experience. The hotel has three bottom floors that were built for a wealthy homeowner in the Gulided Age. All the floors and walls are original.  Three floors were added when it baca,e part of the cotton industry. 

There are rooms filled with glass cases hoising bolts of cotton and you can have clothing custom made.  The breakfast buffet and hot service are impeccable and every possible food is offered. A huge outdoor patio filled with plants is open for breakfast, lunch, cocktails and dinner. 

The staff, including a concierge who stays until 9pm, are incredibly helpful and friendly. The location is blocks from Casa Battl and La Padrera and is close to a subway and many great shops and restaurants. I loved this hotel. I didn't go in the pool on the roof but I took a nap on the lounge chair and it was almost as comfortable as the lixurios king sized bed. ",5,2016,06,04
13,Just steps Away from everything,"First, and foremost, DO NOT rent a car. This city is made for walking. Cars will just get in your way.

Second, The Cotton House is an upscale hotel with a very low key manner. 

Sonia, at the front desk chose to call our delivery company herself, rather than worry us with our delivery. Even more so, Sonia chose to make sure the delivery was made and went on to confirm all things. We arrived back and all was handled (Thank You Sonia).

The restaurant has slow service and seems at times to be a little disjointed. Compared to the Front Desk and the Housekeeping Departments, they are lacking.

Speaking of Housekeeping, this is one of the best teams I have witnessed. I would say these rooms are the best kept rooms I have seen; plank floors, great showers, private toilet, and balcony!",5,2016,06,02
13,Great boutique hotel with modern amenities ,"Stayed here for 3 nights in May. Amazing interior design and history. Lots of unique common areas. Staff were young, fluent in English and very helpful. As noted in previous posts, the aroma of the lobby is amazing. While the pool is small, the area is comfortable with nice views of SF. Great shower in our room which is not common in all European hotels. ",5,2016,06,01
13,Stunning Hotel,"The Cotton House hotel is one of the most beautifully appointed properties I have ever stayed at. The history, decor, and ambiance of the hotel are magical. You definitely feel like you are on vacation staying here. Plus, the hotel smells heavenly. When we drove up to the hotel in a taxi I was a little worried about being on such a busy street but once you get into the hotel all the noise and chaos disappears. The concierge and front desk were wonderful, always willing to help out- reserve tickets, make dinner reservations, etc. The rooms are on the smaller side, standard for Europe, but they are laid out logically and our room had a small balcony which overlooked other apartments and made us feel like a local for a minute. The outside area off the restaurant is a gorgeous oasis and I am sure the roof top pool is a nice place for a dip when the weather is hot (it was open when we were there but it wasn't hot enough to use it). The location of the hotel is a short walk to Las Ramblas and centrally located to many sites in town. I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2016,05,31
13,Fantastic Stay!!!!!,"We stayed in this hotel for seven nights while enjoying all that beautiful Barcelona has to offer. The hotel is beautiful, sexy and foxy and the staff will do anything to please. The restaurant and bar are very nice. We will definitely will be coming back.

13,Everything was perfect,"We stayed a night before our cruise and wished we could have stayed longer.
The room, lobby,, bar, and public spaces are gorgeous - including the stairways (there are elevators but be sure to see the spiral staircase).

Location is great.

The service is amazing.

A perfect stay...",5,2016,05,27
13,Can't get better!,Loved our stay at the Cotton House while on our first trip to Europe. Staff was very attentive and couldn't do enough to help you. Very comfy and decorative room. Great location close to the best area and restaurants. Though pricey you get what you pay for!!,5,2016,05,26
13,The center of Barcelona,Marriott has something going with its series of Autograph Collection hotels.  We stayed for five delightful nights.  Almost everything you was to see in Barcelona is within walking distance of the property.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Jonathan and Alex our bartenders have great mixology skills.  Eunice the concierge will go out of his way to assist you.  After a day of site seeing you can relax with a glass of Cava on the large outdoor terrace.  The rooms have a walk in rain shower and very upscale bedding.  The Cotton House is what you expect from a Five Star.,5,2016,05,26
13,Absolute Perfection!,"This hotel is stylish and beautiful. The staff was cordial and accommodating.  My room had a balcony with 2 comfortable chairs and a table.  The breakfast buffet was delicious.  It offered fresh squeezed juices, multiple selections of hams, cheeses, breads, vegetables, fruits, and homemade baked goods.  The uniformed staff was friendly and always attentive.  A nice touch worth mentioning:   When I got to my room someone had written ""you look beautiful"" on my mirror over the sink in white marker and a welcome not on the dressing mirror.  I hadn't seen this before and thought it was clever.  I'm not sure how this hotel found so many young and attractive staff, as other hotel guests commented on this too. ",5,2016,05,24
13,A Gem,"The Cotton House is a unique boutique hotel in a great location. Old town, fantastic shopping, great restaurants and the Hop on Hop off bus stop were within easy walking distance. The concierge was very helpful in booking dinner reservations, tours, etc, the hotel common areas are beautiful and although the rooms are a bit small they are nicely decorated. The breakfast, which places quality over quantity, was spectacular. Delicious local meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, eggs cooked to order and the most delectable dessert table we have ever experienced! Our only complaint was that the pool was unusable as it was not heated. However that is forgivable in early April😉 All around we had a fantastic stay and would recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2016,05,23
13,Great one night stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Cotton House for one night following a country hoping vacation.  Although we stayed on points, we were treated very warmly.  The room size was good, too. Not nearly as small as some reviews warned. Definitely have a drink on the Terrance.  Will stay here again the next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2016,05,21
13,Great hotel style and lovely Staff,"This was a wonderful experience from our time arriving to our final check out after 4 nights when leaving.  Full credit to the staff who made our stay extra pleasant and nice while staying here.  Room was new and with great style.  Walking distance to the old city, cathedral, Sagrada Familia and other points of interest.  Will have to return next time we make it back to Barcelona.",5,2016,05,21
13,"Great location, great boutique hotel","This very cute boutique hotel is in a great location, just blocks away from Plaza Cataluña and Casa Batllo. The rooms are pretty standard size for European hotels and breakfast was very good, though not included in our rate. Concierge staff was also very helpful in helping us to book various tours. ",4,2016,05,21
13,Exceptional Hotel - Fantastic Value,"We enjoyed 3 nights early May at the Cotton House Hotel and very pleased with staff, restaurant and rooms/decor.   Definitely on our list for a return stay!   As Marriott Platinum I was upgraded and very pleased with quality of room!  Excellent value and service.  An issue with the 2nd room we booked for our daughter, but they changed floors for her room shortly after check in - simple and painless.  

Great location and easy to to/from rail station.  Always a cab nearby. 

",5,2016,05,20
13,Loved the hotel and staff. Did not like the room.,"We stayed here for 5 nights, then we traveled to Madrid,  returning for 1 night before heading home. We had a marvelous time staying at this hotel. We had a wonderful breakfast each morning. A couple of times we had lunch which was great. Late cocktails in the bar a nice experience, order a gin tonic at least once. All the rooms downstairs are beautiful and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. It would not be fair to give this glowing review without giving a hint to our room. This is an old textile company converted into a hotel. They kept all the beautiful architecture of the original building except where they put in the rooms. The wallpaper, flooring and general construction was done in a low budget manner and it shows. Our room was so small that I had the closet open getting into the safe and as my husband opened the bathroom door it hit my back. Our shower backed up everyday until after 2 trys, the last day it drained. Because of the style of wicker between the glass the dirt that got trapped cannot be cleaned so there you have that.  The second stay we had a much nicer room and the atmosphere was not so depressing but still not elegant like the rest of the hotel. ",3,2016,05,20
13,"Amazing Staff, Lots of Class and Style","Over the years I have spent hundreds, maybe even thousands of nights at a Marriott brand property, not counting the many weeks spent at my Marriott brand timeshares.  In Barcelona I believe I finally hit the top of the line in style, class, beauty, location, staff kindness, and professional service.  The thoughtful and considerate staff, who go above and beyond every single day, are exceptional, but more about that later.  Housekeeping is magic, keeping everything spotless and clean every day, and I am positive that this is no easy task. The perfect location and convenience of this hotel to various tourist attractions, shopping and dining is extremely important to a single traveler like me.  I spent a week at the Cotton House Hotel so I had the opportunity to get to know several of the staff on a first name basis.  While all the staff members here are experts in the ""spirit to serve"" I would like to recognize some employees that really went the extra mile to make my stay as perfect as possible.  Albert Benito, Gabriel (Gabby) Borrego, Sara Navarro, Marta Ramiro, Clara Sallies,and Alonso Ruiz are all exceptional with their customer service skills and also in their particular position, either at the front door, front desk, or restaurant.  This group of young people obviously know how to work together as a team, and to deliver the most outstanding guest experience I have ever enjoyed.  My thanks to all of you, you are the best of the best.  I can only look forward to returning again and again.  Most Sincerely, Janet S",5,2016,05,19
13,Fabulous hotel! 5 star service,"Upon arriving at Cotton House I was blown away at how professional the staff was. Hotels with this quality of staff is normally what differentiates a 4 star from a 5 star hotel. Everyone in the hotel makes sure to greet you with a smile and they always do whatever they can to make sure you are taken care of. 

Our room was luxurious with a nice balcony. The bed was comfortable.

Upstairs there is a nice rooftop deck with a pool. 

Overall I will stay here anytime I visit Barcelona.",5,2016,05,19
13,Excellent Location & Staff but didn't feel too special,"I spent 2 weekend nights here recently and had a difficult time rating this hotel. On the positive side, the common areas and the rooms are very well decorated and in great condition (as you would expect for a relatively new hotel).  The location of the hotel is fantastic, in a very nice area and a close walk to restaurants and the subway. The air conditioning works perfectly and stays cold (something important to me and not always the case in Europe). The staff was very friendly and gives off the appearance of wanting to be helpful.  However, when you delve into the details, beneath the surface is a somewhat different side.  For example, I wanted to eat an early dinner at the hotel restaurant.  It was completely empty; not another guest. The pleasant hostess spent about 5 mins trying to figure out if I could be seated because she said they were going to be busy.  She seated me at an uncomfortable table in the corner.  As I left after dinner, there were only 2 more guests in the restaurant.  Although my room was very nicely decorated & in excellent condition, my window overlooked a wall (see photo).  As a platinum member who spends over 120 nights/yr at Marriotts, I would expect a little better.  I asked the front desk about an upgrade and the very pleasant clerk replied that this was the category room I booked and there weren’t any upgrades available.  Lastly, like many hotel rooms, my room had a door that allowed it to be combined with a 2nd room.  The locked connecting door was so thin and poorly insulated that I could hear every word spoken by the people in the room on the other side of the door. Unfortunately, their conversations continued until 2:30am.  Upon checkout, the very pleasant desk clerk said she was sorry to hear about my issues.  Oh well.  When traveling to a place like Barcelona, I don’t expect to spend a lot of time in a hotel room.  But, in the few hours I am in there, I want it to be peaceful and to look out to something more than a wall.",4,2016,05,19
13,Wonderfully updated masterpiece,"My wife and I spent a couple of nights here in early May and loved the way that old world charm and architecture have been blended with all of the contemporary comforts that we could ask for.  Public areas are very well presented - the outside bar at first floor level is a great place to simply sit, sip and relax.  Our bedroom and bathroom were both large - especially by European standards - very comfortable and  very well furnished.
Staff were remarkably young, polished, polite and very enthusiastic.
And the restaurant was excellent - way better than one would normally expect in an hotel.",5,2016,05,19
13,Eclectic Beauty,This hotel is beautifully decorated and is in a great location. The staff is helpful and will go out of their way to please. We stayed here for two nights after a cruise and enjoyed our stay. We could easily walk to many restaurants in the evening. Cab rides to anywhere we went were cheap and efficient.,5,2016,05,18
13,A fantastic gem in a wonderful city ,"Stayed with my girlfriend in April for my birthday. From the minute we arrived we fell in love with the place.
The staff are helpful, polite and full of welcoming smiles.
They had even left us a treat in the room and written happy birthday on the mirror.
The hotel which is set in a former cotton house has fantastic facilities including a rooftop pool and a relaxing garden. It's decoration is magnificent and we loved the spiral staircase. It also has wonderful rooms and the comfiest bed I have ever stayed in. The bathrooms are equally as impressive. 
Breakfast was delicious and although we didn't have dinner we did enjoy a glass or two of wine which was reasonably priced.
It's central location on top of everything else makes it a truly 5 star hotel and we will definitely be back when we return to Barcelona! ",5,2016,05,18
13,Amazing place to stay in Barcelona,This is truly an elegant boutique hotel with fabulous service.  You could feel the wonderful ambiance when you walked in.  All the staff greets you like a welcome guest.  The decor is beautiful.   And you can add a perfect location to all of that.  Our room was so lovely and comfortable.  All levels of the superb staff offer amazing service.  This is the place to stay in Barcelona.,5,2016,05,18
13,Perfect in every way. ,This hotel is right in the heart of everything you want to do. The only place that wasn't walking distance was Park Guell. The staff is warm and welcoming especially Nuri. The breakfast was perfect each morning. The hotel is really beautiful. The rooms were 5 stars. Love the Nespresso machine in your room. ,5,2016,05,18
13,"Stunning, artistic and more oh my!","As soon as you walk into the hotel you feel the difference.   The lobby is stunning, the employees are gracious and the hotel's ambiance is blissful.  The rooms are spacious and very nicely decorated.   The bed is like sleeping on a cloud.  The library is a wonderful place to have afternoon tea or an early evening cocktail.   You will not be disappointed.  If you are going to Barcelonia this is the place to stay.   Thank you Cotton House for making our stay so special.",5,2016,05,17
13,Beautiful hotel,"Cotton house was truly a beautiful hotel. Wonderful staff. Five stars in all respects. Great location. Easy access to all points of interest. Casa Batallo is within walking distance ,as are other attractions. Safe to walk at night. Numerous outstanding restaurants in area. Loved Barcelona. People were very friendly, and the cost of food,drink,and attractions was very reasonable.",5,2016,05,17
13,Best Sleep Ever!,"This hotel offered the most comfortable night sleep I had over my entire trip.  The location is FANTASTIC, the hotel smells great, everyone is very friendly and accommodating, the rooms are beautiful, and the history of the hotel is interesting.  I typically don't gush over a hotel since I prefer to spend my time out and about exploring, rather than in a hotel relaxing, but, this hotel was definitely one that I couldn't help but love!",5,2016,05,17
13,Central Location with a great rooftop view,"We spent two nights here recently and were very pleased. The location is only a short walk from the airport bus drop at the Placa Catalunya and perfect for exploring downtown Barcelona on foot. We walked to La Sagrada Familia, the Picasso Museum, the waterfront, and Las Ramblas. There were plenty of restaurants and grocery stores nearby. Much has been written in other reviews about the courtyard terrace, which was beautiful but don't overlook the rooftop pool deck at the fitness center. You can see all of Barcelona along with a view of La Sagrada Familia. Grab a bottle of wine from a nearby grocery then go up and treat yourself to a wonderful sunset panorama! 
As this was a European Hotel, we did not expect a huge room. But the size of our room was very adequate and the appointments were quite nice. We were particularly impressed on how quiet the room was even though the hotel is in center city. We slept very well. Service was very good, and the breakfast was great! I would recommend this hotel and stay there again.",5,2016,05,17
13,Exceptional service!,"The Cotton house is in a great central location, but what truly separates this hotels is the exceptional service by every staff member that we encountered.  The hotel is also beautiful and serves a great breakfast in the restaurant.  As another note: there is no concierge lounge so Marriott gold/platinum also have complimentary breakfast in the restaurant.",5,2016,05,17
13,"Excellent service, beautiful surroundings and perfect service",We stayed for (unfortunately) just one night at this fabulous hotel very near the city centre. We were met by friendly elegant young staff who took us on a tour of the building before showing us to our spacious room with a massive extremely comfortable bed. Despite being on the Gran Via the room was perfectly soundproofed and we had no noise issues. We walked into town to shop on our first day and walked back from the sagrada familia the next day in around 20 minutes. The breakfast is more than ample with a selection that would keep the fussiest water content. The original fixtures had been restored and we enjoyed time sitting in the library. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay.,5,2016,05,17
13,Best Hotel in Barcelona ,"We have been to Barcelona 8 times and this is the first time we have stayed at the Cotton House Hotel, we will definitely be returning . Exceptional standards.Fantastic staff, especially Edward the waiter who gave us some great tips about where to go in Sitges and the wonderful door man who gave me a cotton flower. Thank you to all the staff. See you again soon. ",5,2016,05,17
13,colonial elegance,"The ambiance of the hotel is amazing, the lobby, the staircase and especially the restaurant and the bar, both indoor and outdoor.  It is a pleasure to be there.  I cannot write anything about the rooms, from what I understood looking at the balconies from the patio, they seemed smallish, our suite was spacious and comfortable, although there was too little closet space and almost no drawers to put our things in.  Ortigia toiletries are the best.  Breakfast was excellent but we did not appreciate that a five star hotel does not offer the option of room service breakfast to guests that occupy breakfast included suites.  The consierge service was also excellent, very helpful even before we arrived at the hotel.  The rest of the staff was not satisfactory and definately not five star.  Every day I would ask for turndown service and they never came!!!!! Although the bar served very nice drinks, we came in once after a very long walk and when we asked for a glass of water before ordering our drinks, an extremely rude barman answered that he should first prepare orders of other guests that were waiting.  That attitude does not show hospitality.",4,2016,05,17
13,"great location, beautiful spot.","The cotton House is a beautiful hotel, in a prime location of barcelona. We had a warm welcome from the staff. The rooms are small and one downfall is that you can hear the people in the next room, a real bummer if your tired. The breakfast was delicious.",4,2016,05,16
13,"Trendy, Elegant and Great Location","Lovely decor throughout the property -- hip, yet tasteful and comfortable -- from reception to guest rooms. Front desk staff was accessible and accommodating. Fantastic, central location near Passeig de Gracia and Placa de Catalunya. Fitness center was small with two pieces cardio equipment, one of which squeaked. The terrace (outside of restaurant) was lovely and would have like to enjoy it more. We were informed that we were not able to eat our breakfast outside (though the space is directly connected to the dining room with plenty of tables) and we would have loved to have spent more time there in the evening; however, the weather was chilly during our stay and the hotel was out of kerosene (for the heater lamps) for three of the four nights of our stay. The concierge staff was accessible, but not quite up to par. It seems they had a selection of ""go-to"" spots, but not a breadth of knowledge about dining destinations. Regardless of some of the short falls, I would stay here again.",4,2016,05,16
13,A Five Star hotel on training wheels,"Let me first say that the staff are all very nice, with a genuine desire to please, and they were very hospitable and kind, each and every one. And the property is beautiful, in a great location. That is very obvious. I think the problem here is a combination of limited experience (they are all quite young), policies that are poorly thought out, and unclear leadership (it is unclear who a manager is, everyone is part of the ""team"" and everyone has a manager title, which means that nobody is a manager).. A common answer that you get to any request is a ""no"". I understand there is not a lot of adult supervision and people don't want to get into trouble, but this is a not a 5 star service mentality. Learn how to say ""yes"" and how can I help.

Need to change a small amount of dollars to euros (on a Sunday when banks are closed and the money changing places are a long walk away at Las Ramblas)? No, not possible. (really, this is pretty much a standard at international 5 star hotels). Run out of cash and want to ask for a 50 euro cash advance (remember, you have given them a 600 plus euro pre-authorization charge)? Impossible. Need an umbrella for a few minutes? You will need to be sure they know your room number and you will be charged if it is not returned promptly in the lobby. How about placing umbrellas in the rooms, perhaps, and not being so bureaucratic about trivia.

I requested a 5am wake up call because I needed to get a taxi and take people to the airport for an early morning flight. My wake up call is missed (it comes at 5:30 - trust me, I asked for 5am). Fortunately I had a backup alarm. Then, when I'm downstairs, the person at the desk is too busy on the phone to help me find a taxi, and at 5:45am I find myself running down the Gran Via trying to grab one myself, wondering why the hell I was staying at this hotel. Really, not five star caliber.

When I check in and when my friends check in, we are all charged pretty outrageous ""pre-payment"" authorization charges to our cards (on fully pre-paid rooms); we were told 100 euros per day, but I was regularly charged 200 euros per day, and one friend was charged a 2200 euro pre-authorization payment for a two day stay. Fortunately our credit lines could stand this, but some people might have real problems with their available credit for a European vacation with such charges, which reduce your available credit. How many hundreds of euros do you think we will take from the minibar, really? Just not a clear focus here. we're your guests, not thieves.

Need to borrow an electric adapter plug? You will be asked to fill out a detailed form. Then you will be lent a plug (from their lost and found, I would add), and told you will be charged 20 euros if it is not returned promptly. Really? Busting peoples' chops over minutiae and charging fines for lost and found adapters? Absurd. Not 5 star. 2 star, maybe?

Was at the front desk and wanted some change for a 5 euro note (to tip some of the hard working bellmen and doormen). Apparently the bill had a small tear which had been repaired with a piece of tape. The young lady declines my bill, explaining that she is not allowed to accept it, but ""perhaps I might be able to pass it in a bar somewhere later"". Really? I know of 5 star hotels that iron their bills and wash their coins for customers (look up the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco if you think I'm kidding). I'm not asking for that, obviously, just not being treated like a counterfeiter over a 5 euro note. The hilarious ending to this tale is that a day later, when I ask for change of a 100 euro note, I am obliviously offered a 50 euro note (almost torn in half), in change, by this same person. Consistency, much?

Will you have clean, fresh sheets? Not always. We had stained sheets upon arrival (looked like some blood). What is Housekeeping doing? By way of apology we received a small plate, delivered with a flourish, (think of a coffee saucer) with a raspberry, a blackberry (moldy), a few tiny bits of candy and two small chocolates. It was really kind of embarrassing (fruit bowls apparently don't exist, a small bottle of wine, or anything not quite so chintzy). 

Spent many days at this hotel and brought friends there also. Was placed in the smallest room they had (not even a bathtub) after all the business I had brought them. It was as if each visit meant I was landing anew from Mars.

And let's not forget chasing after the housekeeping trolley to get adequate toilet paper (ever been left a 1/4 roll for two people upon checkin?), or an almost empty box of facial tissues.

Bottom line, as my friends so accurately said, ""5 star? they are struggling to be a 3 star"".

I'm sorry. I wasn't going to criticize after just the first few things. The people there are really very nice, and I don't blame them. But after the 5th and 6th item, I felt this was the only way to get management's attention. I'm not an auditor, just a guest. But a guest at a number of 5 star properties around the world for the past few decades, and wanted to share some international standards and expectations. ",3,2016,05,16
13,The place to stay in Barcelona,"There are many fine hotels in Barcelona, but I would be surprised if any are better, particularly at the price. Staff is friendly, competent and helpful, and facilities are first rate. Common areas,  rooms , and bathrooms are extremely well-designed and handsomely decorated. It's like staying as a guest in an old-world mansion with a modernized touch. The hotel even smells good. It's website definitely does not do it justice. Located a short walk from Metro and world-class shopping district.Would return in a heartbeat.",5,2016,05,15
13,Beautiful and elegant,"We stayed at the Cotton House and loved it for its charm and its gracious staff.  The hotel used to be the Cotton Textile Foundation building, so the hotel has kept the textile/cotton theme throughout--complete with cotton bolls in the rooms. The location is great for walking all over Barcelona.  Our room was facing the busy street out front, but no street noise came inside.  The restaurant is charming and beautiful and the rooftop terrace is a bonus.",5,2016,05,13
13,8 Night Stay.... Great Location... Staff... Decor .... Experience,"The Cotton House represents the charm of Barcelona perfectly. The hotel was built in the mid 1800's and turned into a hotel last year. You are given a tour of the hotel at checkin. When you walk past the lobby and to the spiral staircase to the first floor, you would think you were going between floors of a museum. It has about 90 rooms and at times I felt there was a one to one relationship between employees and rooms. Every employee greeted you when you walked by. The concierge desk was staffed from 9 am to 11 pm with mid day having 2 people. An example of the level of service they try and achieve. Before we arrived we asked about and purchased tickets to an FC Barcelona football game. It was pricey ( 500 euros for 2 tickets) and I while thought I might be overpaying, it was easy, worry free and with 100,000 season ticket owners the only way to see a game. We were met at the hotel by someone whose job it was to get into a taxi with us (we paid) and escort us to our seats. The person used a cheap seat ticket to get in and didn't stay for the game. This would have been the same no matter what level seats we purchased. The tickets were mid field, 11 rows up from players bench. The hotel is just the middleman but they could fine tickets that are less customer service friendly.

The hotel is short walk to Placa Catalunya. It is walking distance to museums, the two Gaudi houses, Segrada Familia, the water front and much more. If you are not up for walking, Placa Catalunya is the Grand Central Station (in NYC) of Barcelona. 

The  buffet breakfast of assorted cheeses, breads, meats, fresh fruits and elaborate deserts are outstasnding.   We skipped it a couple of times because it ruined our appetite for lunch.

5 star hotel in every way.",5,2016,05,11
13,Best front desk in the world !,I came here to the hotel for short trip and check in by a young lady in the front desk. It regretted that I cannot remember her name but she's absolutely amazing. Very friendly but professional and smart. She sold all of my problem always with a beautiful smile on her face ! Definitely will come back !,5,2016,05,10
13,Very Chic Boutique Hotel,"We stayed 8 nights at this recently opened 80+ room hotel on the well-located Gran Via de Les Corts Catalanes. We chose it for its design and location and were not disappointed. We had a lovely, bright ""Egyptian room"" facing the Gran Via which included a large walk-in closet and was very quiet. All the public rooms were stunning and very welcoming as were the entire staff of the hotel. We especially enjoyed Pisco Sours and a plate of Iberico in the Library in the early evenings!",5,2016,05,10
13,Great Stay,"Beautiful hotel, decor, unbelievable breakfast, funky bar and great outdoor space for meals or drinks.. Just a flawless hotel.. Great location to be able to walk to the old city, not too close and not too far from Las Ramblas.",5,2016,05,10
13,"Lovely boutique hotel , with amazing service, centrally located in Barcelona","I stayed for one night, the room was very comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. Breakfast area and lobby, as well as other facilities of the hotel, were also extremely charming and different. Room I stayed had a balcony, which is a blessing for smokers like me. Hotel is 5-10 min walk from city centre. Service was impeccable. Would definitely recommend ro anyone looking for a boutique hotel with a personal touch.",5,2016,05,10
13,Spectacular Hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"I've no words about this amazing hotel. Everything was more than perfect and frankly it was one of the best hotel i've ever been to. The room was clean and tastfully designed, the Hotel staff was very helpful and pleasent. I strongly recommend it for romantic stay in Barcelona.",5,2016,05,09
13,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,My wife spent three days at this hotel at the end of a cruise.  The staff was very responsive to our needs.  The room was spacious and well laid out. The public areas were exquisite. Food at the restaurant was good and the service was outstanding.  We would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,05,07
13,"Amazing public spaces, disappointing rooms","The hotel is incredibly stylish, the staff are young and friendly, and the overall quality of the property is very high. I hadn't realised that I had booked the base level room (they're called Panama rooms, for reference). When the very nice young man from reception took us to our room and opened the door, I thought it was perhaps a mistake. There was absolutely no natural light - I thought we'd been given a room without a window. Turns out there was one small window looking onto an interior air shaft, and the blackout blinds were drawn. We raised the blinds, but the blinds were broken and only went up one side. The rooms are finished to a very high standard, and the bathrooms are very nice. But the configuration of the room was really poor, and not at all what I would have expected. So if you plan on staying at the hotel, make sure you get one of the rooms at the back, or plan on spending all your time in the public spaces of the hotel. A few other gripes - the wardrobes are badly designed, so your clothes can't actually hang, but instead rest awkwardly on the shelf below, which is too high. And there was a light bulb out in the very stylish fixture on the mirror in the bathroom. These aren't the kinds of details you expect a hotel like this to get wrong. I'm use to small hotel rooms in Europe, and in fact some of my favourite hotels have minuscule rooms. But they make better use of the space, and give you an overall more charming experience. Our room at the Cotton House just didn't measure up.",3,2016,05,06
13,Everything is made of cotton!!!!,"First off everything there is made of cotton! Haha sounds lame, but trust us you will be marveling at the same thing but the time you leave. Cotton House did not disappoint. It is located walking distance from pretty much everything in Barcelona and the staff at Cotton House go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay so consider this one a good investment to your time in Barcelona. 

The attention to detail in each room was beautiful and even walking around the hotel was lovely since there was art at every turn and it smelled amazing:) Overall everyone in our group could not get over the quality of the food, rooms, drinks, service, etc. Make sure to check out the cute rooftop pool area for a pretty good view of the city.

Staff were available at all times and seemed to anticipate every need. We will definitely be back to Cotton House and would recommend hands down for any trip to Barcelona if you can score a room!",5,2016,05,03
13,Design and hospitality,"An excellent location, a superbly renovated historical house,a really stunning courtyard terrace, a breakfast worth paying for.
But over all friendly and smiling hosts,everywhere but especially at the patient and effective reception and the bell service.
",5,2016,05,03
13,Simply Amazing!,"We spent a week at the Cotton House and we just loved it!!! Great design, amazing deco and superb staff! The location is very convenient. On our last day, while enjoying the delicious breakfast west Pete Doherty! We will definitely be back, very soon :)",5,2016,05,03
13,Beautiful setting in great location!,"The service, accommodations, common areas, and central location of this hotel are all exceptional. The building is beautiful, historic, and serenely comfortable.  There is a beautiful outdoor deck for dining, drinks, relaxing. All the staff was attentive and helpful, from the front desk to concierge to wait staff. Very comfortable bed, bedding, and amazing shower. We could and did walk right out the front door of the hotel and were steps away from both the Old City and the Eixample. Would definitely recommend staying here.",5,2016,05,01
13,Amazing Stay!,Me and my wife stayed in this great art hotel for 5 days. starting from the check in to the check out everything was marbelous. Olga Monje made our stay extremely special by checking on us regularly! The highlight of our stay was SHAKIRA and her husband PIQUE!!!! since im a great football fan and my wife a fan of Shakira we both had a very pleasant moment :),5,2016,05,01
13,Amazing Comfort in a Beautiful setting,"Barcelona was our first stop on a three city European trip.  We stayed at the Cotton House hotel on Via de les Corts Catalanes.  The Hotel is amazingly beautiful and quaint.  The best was the most comfortable we have ever experienced.  The room overlooked a courtyard where you can relax or have drinks.  The staff, was for the most part very young, but nice.  The breakfast was nothing short of amazing.  Beautiful buffet with meats, breads fruit and cheese - and to top it off you can order eggs how you like them.  Best eggs I have had - cooked to perfection.  The location is great close to three metro stops.  Safe neighborhood to walk late at night.  This is not a large hotel, 50 or so rooms, rooms are standard in size.  Nice library to have a after dinner drink.",5,2016,04,29
13,Incredible Hotel,"I could go on and on about this hotel and city but to state it simply, fabulous hotel in a great location in an unbelievable city. There is so much History in this hotel and its surroundings. Love the ceiling in the dining area. Rooms are fantastic and you have all the required amenities. Service is the same as well, very helpful and courteous. Breakfast spread is fantastic .",5,2016,04,29
13,excellent location and great hotel!,"the Cotton House is a lovely boutique hotel.  The staff is fantastic.  The food was quite good (exceptional bfast) and the drinks quite tasty in a fantastic setting.  The room I had was quite large and well appointed.  The location of this hotel is great, close to many popular areas, bit of a neighborhood feel in one direction and tourist spots close by as well.  Also quite close to public transport.  Love that Marriott has added these Autograph Collection hotels to their network.  This is a great place to stay.",5,2016,04,28
13,Top Notch hotel in building formerly housing Cotton Textile Foundation!,"Grand without being ostentatious. Glamorous while giving the appearance of subdued. Discrete - you could drive by, and we did, without noticing it. Service staff, and there are many, are all geared to exceeding your expectations. Located in trendy part of Barcelona with world class sights and cuisine within walking distance or very short cab ride. Great dining, hip bar, and a rooftop pool. Hats off to Marriott for making this a hot new hotel in Barcelona!",4,2016,04,28
13,Wonderful boutique hotel in old Barcelona,"Stayed 5 nights for my 30th wedding anniversary... and enjoyed every minute of the stay. Can't say enough about the quality of service, the care and the professionalism of the hotel staff. The property itself is georgeous with many unique touches. There are many things to check out including a beautiful spiral staircase, a quaint reading room, a swimming pool and work out room (6th floor), a beautiful restaurant and patio and much more. The hotel is surrounded by shops and restaurants and is only a 4 block walk to Playa Catalunya (park at the north end of old Barcelona). Our room was very nice, comfortable and well appointed. Just enough luxury to feel spoiled but not overboard.

My wife loved the property and the attention and service she received from the staff.

A big thank you to everyone at the Cotton House. You helped make our anniversary extra special.",5,2016,04,25
13,Fabulous Hotel,"We were recently in Barcelona, with our 12 year old granddaughter, and were so lucky to stay at this fabulous hotel.  
Everything about the hotel is upscale, and well done.  The cotton branches in lobby and rooms remind you of what the hotel's original purpose was.  We had a lovely room with a patio and loved the decor of the room.
The hotel staff was very attentive.  I found that most were interns from an university's hospitality program, so although they were young they were enthusiastic.  The location is perfect for walking to many of Barcelona's sites. Really loved the breakfast.  
The Cotton House is part of the Marriott family but it is a very European hotel.",5,2016,04,21
13,Loved our stay!,"My husband booked for us to stay for 4 nights for my birthday and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was truly amazing. The staff are so friendly and sent some macaroons to the room as it was my birthday. The atmosphere, the smell, the decor of the entire hotel is stunning. I especially loved the cotton flowers and how they had kept a lot of references of when it was a cotton factory. We loved our room the Egyptian Room, the shower was huge! The bar area and outside area are lovely and we will definitely be back to stay. I wish it had been warm enough to swim but the pool was not heated so it was freezing, I tried dipping my feet in! I kept eating the chocolate cranberries in the entrance and when we left they gave me some wrapped up which was a very sweet attention!",5,2016,04,18
13,Top notch hotel in great location ,"Hotel in one of best parts of town and has upscale rooms and areas for guests.  More  of boutique style hotel as lobby and restaurant not  very large but very well appointed. Rooms are great and bathrooms in particular are very nice with large shower and bathtub configuration. Staff is very friendly but a little inexperienced. That is, a lot of the staff seemed to be very young and while helpful were a little short on the level of experience. Good breakfast buffet option.  ",5,2016,04,14
13,Love everything about it!,"We are currently staying here, I'm already sad thinking about checking out at the end of the week. We are Marriott Gold members, we got an upgrade and love our room. The room isn't huge but it's big enough, plus, I love the bathtub! The ambiance of the hotel is amazing and all of the rooms (the library, the dining area, the pool, the lobby) are perfectly done. We love how they have stuck with the integrity and history of the building but made it modern enough to be a really nice hotel. We were deciding between staying here and the Hotel Arts (Ritz Carlton); we visited the Hotel Arts while here and are so glad we stayed at the Cotton House! Great location, great and helpful team, and great atmosphere. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2016,04,13
13,Lovely boutique hotel in a great location,"I am a regular Marriott user and gold member so the lack a free room upgrade was a little disappointing but it is only if they can manage it so not a big issue for us. The location is easy to find from Placa De Catalunya and only a short walk so it is in a great place for getting about the center of Barca. It is also only a 30 minute walk up to the Sagrada Familia and about 30 minutes down to the beach so ideal.
The room as  slightly on the small side for the huge bed it had but it was a lovely room with a great big walk in shower and very nicely decorated and clean with a balcony overlooking the central area so we had no road noise. We did have some noise on the Monday of our stay which sounded like someone working on the roof and also the plumbing seemed a little noisy on the Sunday night so a think a lower floor may be better.
The hotel itself is beautiful on the inside and I recommend the spiral staircase if you want to get fit after all the wonderful food you will eat.
The staff are very nice and very helpful but they did seem to have attended the hotel school of looking busy without being efficient. Overall though we got everything we asked for and they couldn't be nicer when they are doing it.
This is a great boutique hotel in a great location which I highly recommend.",4,2016,04,12
13,"Wonderful service, great location and a really nice boutique hotel","We booked this hotel since we use Marriott and this is a Marriott hotel, albeit not branded as such, but the Autograph Collection hotels are part of the Marriott chain.  We were also looking for something more in line with the local culture. The Cotton House surely fit this bill as it was a former cotton mill and has been transformed into a boutique hotel and is on the edge of the historical district and centrally located so you can walk almost everywhere.  The rooms are very nice, with all the amenities you need.  There is a really nice (but a bit pricey) restaurant on site as well.  The best feature of the hotel and restaurant is the service.  Everyone is very,very nice and exfremely courteous, catering to your every need.  The concierge also went out of their way to help getting our train tickets confirmed and printed.  I can not say enough about how much we liked our experience.  When in Barcelona again we will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,11
13,Loved everything about it!,I'm reading reviews by other folks who presumably stayed here the same time I did and I had a completely different experience. From walking in to leaving 2.5 days later we were treated with respect and concern. My husband was sick the 2nd day and a server put together a wonderful breakfast for him after they had been closed for a half hour! Most of the staff spoke English and remembered us throughout our stay. I would recommend the Cotton House whole-heartedly!,5,2016,04,11
13,"Top boutique hotel, great design, a perfect stay for us","First-time visit to Barcelona, and decided to stay here due to its great location (so close to Sagrada Familia, Casa Battlo, Palau de la Musica Orfeo Catalana, Gothic Quarter, Las Rambla etc). We were upgraded to a slightly larger room with full bath / shower, this hotel is only a few years old but with a rich history. I loved hanging out in the early morning in the library - wonderful ceilings - and as the name implies, this building has a history of being a high-end tailor, and the decorative touches fit a wonderful place like Barcelona.

For an altogether too-brief trip of 3+ days, my spouse and I absolutely loved staying here. First-rate breakfast served adjacent to the aforementioned library; staff greeted us with water at the lobby, along with a nice chocolate cake-like snack; helpful, polite and knowledgeable concierges; 2 blocks to the excellent metro and bus system (tip: get a T10 pass and travel like a local, although of course taxis are everywhere).

Amazed how quiet the room was being in the center of a major city; may have been because we were facing the rear of the building, and having a small balcony to sit was great. Beds and linens were top-notch; we walked so much we slept very soundly, and the room A/C/heating (it was early April so weather was a bit cool) we could not tell when it was on or not, unlike so many hotels in the US. 

We stopped by the Majestic Hotel on Passeig de la Gracia, and one other one on the same street as the Cotton House, and they had a different feeling; perhaps ostentatious is the word? Yes polished and high-end, but perhaps the difference is whether you want to be 'flashy' in your luxury or understated; the Cotton House was the latter, and it suited us very well. My spouse absolutely loved it, and I suspect we'll be visiting again.",5,2016,04,11
13,Hope to stay there again,"Outstanding hotel, great staff, and very good location. Stayed two nights before heading off to a meeting in nearby Castelldefels and wanted a hotel that was centrally located to easily explore Barcelonia on foot and was surrounded by restaurants that provided good food at a reasonable cost. This hotel has beautiful common areas and the room, even though at the front of the hotel was quiet, thanks to the very thick windows. The only negative comment would be that the WiFi seemed a little slow.",5,2016,04,10
13,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"My daughter and I recently spent her Spring Break from school in Barcelona and stayed at Cotton House Hotel.  It is a beautiful boutique hotel with a great sense of history.  It is a perfect location and within walking distance to many of the key spots in Barcelona:  Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, La Rambla, Passieg de Gracia shopping and the El Born and Barri Gottic neighborhoods.  The staff was fantastic and very friendly.  The rooms were wonderfully comfortable and modern while having an early 19th century vibe.  We would stay here again in a second!",5,2016,04,06
13,Outstanding staff; nice property,"The staff at the Cotton House, although quite young, tried very hard to insure our stay was perfect.  The property was certainly nice; however, not up to the standard of a JW branded hotel, for example.  We enjoyed our stay thanks to the outstanding service, pleasant attitudes, professionalism, and desire to ""get it right"" by the staff.  The rooms were comfortable, nicely appointed, but a bit on the small-ish side for the price.  We had the Egyptian which is upsized and was just enough room for 3 people w/ the pull-out sofa bed.  With the sofa bed out, the desk was rendered unusable.  Next to the great staff, probably the next best thing about the hotel was its location.  Very centrally located to many of the tourist areas in town or a short cab ride away (although the cab drivers seem to always want to take the longest route possible so watch for that).  Roof-top pool patio off of the 6th floor was very nice to enjoy the sun and a quiet, BYOB drink.",4,2016,04,04
13,poor customer service,"Although this appears to be a lovely property, I had a troubling experience with their customer service which I will share with you as a cautionary tale.  Recently, I mistakenly booked a room at their prepaid rate.  This was an honest mistake and when it was discovered I immediately cancelled--this was for a date three and a half months forward--surely no problem on their end with re-selling this room. However, they insisted on pushing the charges forward and now I am left with a $429. charge for an honest mistake. That is a lot of money for a human error. This is an archaic and punitive policy which does much damage to customer relations--They have of course lost a customer and, in my book, damaged their brand.",2,2016,04,01
13,Boutique Extravagance in the heart of Barcelona!,"Wow!!!!This place was spectacular!  This hotel was an old cotton factory and they kept that in mind with a lot of the design elements of the property!  My daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights and it was one of the highlights of our trip!  The staff was always smiling and helpful with suggestions for anything.  The breakfast selection is amazing and the service was super-friendly and attentive.  Our room was on the sixth floor, very quite.  We had a huge king size bed and the bathroom with its rainfall shower head and cotton luxe robes was first class.  The location itself was perfect.  A five minute walk to Las Ramblas and convenient stops along the Metro.  If you looking for a five star experience with a small, boutique atmosphere, The Cotton House is PERFECTION!!!",5,2016,03,31
13,Just WOW!!!,"This was our second visit to a Marriot autograph collection (first being the Lexington hotel at New York) and we were just impressed! We were given a complimentary upgrade by the staff on our arrival which was a pleasant surprise :)

The room was really neat and clean, with a separate small room for bath (bathtub and shower) and a smaller room for toilet. The washbasin is in the room and not in bathroom. Amother good surprise was the balcony were we ended up having dinner one night. 
The housekeeping staff also did a good job. I will tick all the boxes for this hotel and will highly recommended...

There is one small minor point of improvement. I see someone can accidentally lock themselves out in the balcony as there is no handle outside. We noticed this and hence left the door a bit open.

Will definitely come back again!",5,2016,03,29
13,Nice hotel great staff terrible room,As the subject line suggests some real positives but our room was dreadful looking into an internal space it was oppressive and depressing it's a real shame because so many things are good about the place but room 511 isn't one of them I am afraid ,3,2016,03,27
13,A week's break,"Decided to spend a week in Barcelona with my wife .Chose the Cotton House hotel simply by chance and had a truly excellent stay.Lovely room,great concierge services(mainly well educated multilingual young interns-whoever was brave enough to try this idea has struck gold).Hotel has only been open for a year and has been beautifully finished.Born from the shell of a cotton factory.
Nothing was too much trouble during our stay and staff very charming and efficient.Booked great restaurants for us and dealt with any of our concerns.We had an Egyptian cotton room on the first floor.My only criticism is the breakfasts are expensive and don't really do justice to the quality of the hotel.We found it much more enjoyable to find a friendly local venue for brunch.
The hotel experience comes at a price,but it is a beautiful boutique hotel with fantastic staff.We will certainly go back .Highly recommended-especially if you want a luxury break from the children!",5,2016,03,24
13,Super Little Gem,"If you prefer a more intimate hotel, The Cotton House is perfect for you.   Great location.  Great staff.  The rooms are much larger than normal European standards.  History buffs will love the hotels past.  Avoid the restaurant.  It is over priced and the service and food were sub par.  This is no reason not to stay in this hotel.  There are plenty of spectacular restaurants in walking distance and the staff is happy to point you in their direction.",5,2016,03,24
13,YES IT IS WHAT I LIKE!,"Hello again dear Barcelona,this hotel is very great,clean, I am very big FCBARCELONA fan that is the main reason for my being in Barcelona often especially COTTON HOUSE it is very big pleasure for every tourist.You can find there positive staff who would like to help you and clean,light rooms.Especially restaurants,breakfast is extremely super.I loved it.Thank you very very much!I will come back!!!",5,2016,03,24
13,Great Stay in Barcelona,"Had a wonderful stay at the Cotton House Hotel.  Excellent room and great service to go with it.  Everyone from the front desk, doorman, cleaning, and restaurant staff was very friendly and accommodating.   The room had great space and a nice shower room.  I am English speaking and the staff were all able to converse easily with me.  

The concierge was able to arrange a car rental with full service at the hotel.  The car company dropped the car off at the hotel, completed the paperwork, and will pickup the car as well.  The nice thing was concierge spoke in English while making arrangements with the car company.  That was very courteous and made us feel comfortable with the transaction.   Extremely professional.  

We enjoyed the restaurant as well.  The manager helped his staff in serving.  Great food representative of the local Barcelona cuisine.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,03,21
13,Amazing experience. .:),"Can't praised enough about this hotel. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out.  Room was wonderful.. we love the bathroom. A gift was given to us since they can't upgraded us..( hotel was full) not that we minded since the room we got was wonderful. Breakfast. .breakfast was a joy. We were lucky enough to sample all .. ( we did visit off season:)...)
The beauty of this hotel is its uniqueness and charms of old building...we're in love.
Staffs was always smiling..makes your day start in a good vibe and so does the evening. 
My boyfriend even have a birthday wishes upon our check out and even got a small cake for it..thank you so much.

We will definitely return and suggest this hotel to our friends and families. 
We have had a wonderful and great stayed. Wish we could stayed longer..
Thank you :)

13,First Rate Experience,"Our first visit to the Cotton House Hotel open just a year. Great location, a beautiful old building brought up to date while respecting the history. Rooms are charming, comfortable and very need supplied. This feels like a boutique hotel, a great find!
The best part of the hotel is the incredible staff, from the initial greeting by Albert with water, chocolate and newspapers and directions and suggestions. The front desk staff so welcoming you felt you were staying in a private home. 
When they found out we were in Barcelona for the marathon, they became part of our support team with a thoughtful tray of fruit, waters and a note of encouragement. 
The  tearoom area and buffet breakfast was amazing. 
We can't wait to visit again!",5,2016,03,16
13,a magical stay in barcelona,"Everything about this hotel shouts 5 stars. From the beautiful design to the outstanding staff, this hotel made for the perfect getaway to Barcelona. Spent each night out on the patio and got to know the bartenders in the restaurant. Also the concierge is very knowledgeable and helped us find some good spots around the city.",5,2016,03,15
13,A real amazing find! Can't say enough about this stay!!!,From checkin to checkout absolutely a 5 star hotel. The front reception area to the gorgeous clean rooms a overall wonderful experience. Wish it was warmer to had been able to use the roof top pool! We stayed 6 nights and it felt like home to us! Such a wonderful caring staff to make our stay so wonderful ! An added benefit was that the front desk helped us out by allowing us to exchange 100 euro a day to our account thus saving us the need to go out  to the banks to exchange money. Very accommodating not seen in many places. I would return next visit for sure!,5,2016,03,13
13,"Nice Hotel, but maybe not for business","Please read my profile for my biases.

As a loyal Marriott traveler, I looked at two hotels on my recent trip to Barcelona, the Cotton House and the nearby Renaissance. Based on Trip Advisor, I chose the Cotton House, which is a great hotel but maybe not if you are traveling for business.

I arrived mid-morning and was very happy that my room, an upgrade to a ""Madras"" room, was available. When coming to Europe from the US I like to sleep for a few hours on arrival, and then get up for the rest of the day, and if I can do that I adapt to the time change quickly. It is not always possible.

The hotel self-identifies as a ""boutique"" hotel, which is a French word meaning ""no concierge lounge"". I kid, there is no lounge but they do offer elite status travelers a nice breakfast.

What it really means is that there is an emphasis on design, and my room was very nice. You enter in through a hallway. On the left were closets flanking a sink, and on the right were two rooms: one for the toilet and another for the bath. The bathroom was a ""wet"" room, meaning that the whole room basically served as the shower. It was clean and there was plenty of hot water, although there was a tiny chip in the enamel of the tub that you can see on the picture.

I do like the fact that you can access the toilet, bath and sink separately, especially if you are sharing the room with someone else.

The main issue I had was that I was there on business, and that means I work for several hours each evening. While I don't have a great picture, the ""desk chair"" was little more than a foot stool. Sitting on it the desk was pretty high - too high to work on a laptop. The other chair in the room, while comfortable, was also too low.

I asked at the front desk if I could get a proper desk chair (silla de escrito). Since I asked on Saturday evening I was told they would need to look into it tomorrow, but I never heard anything more. I did discover that I could use the night stand and the chair in the room as a substitute, but it would have been nice to have a proper desk.

That said, since I plan to return with my wife in September, I also visited the Renaissance hotel a couple of blocks away.  The rooms there as not as nice or quite as large, but they do have a free minibar in the ""executive"" rooms. Neither hotel has a concierge lounge. Both have a deck on the top floor (Floor 6 for the Cotton House and Floor 8 for the Renaissance - Americans be sure to add 1 to that number). The deck at the Renaissance has a nice view including the Sagrada Familia, but the Cotton House has a pool (I did not get to see the Cotton House deck as it was closed).

If I return on business, I'll probably book at the Renaissance, but since my trip in September is a holiday, I've booked at the Cotton House again. It's her birthday and I think the Cotton House experience is a little more special.

The staff at both hotels are insanely friendly as are most people in Barcelona, so I don't think you can go wrong.",4,2016,03,11
13,Amazing stay!,"We stayed two nights at the beautiful hotel and loved every moment there.
The hotel is gorgeous, ideally located and the interior design is full of soul and uniqueness. 

The staff are very keen to help you and provide a detailed and charming standard of service.
Paula, at the front desk, was excepcionnally generous by bringing us macarons to our room upon our arrival and she ensured everythins was okay throughout our stay.

We highly recoomend this hotel, it has everything you need brought with a smile!",5,2016,03,11
13,Simply Amazing!,"Highly recommended staying here!  Very modern, with a nod to the past.  Rooms were gorgeous, clean, worth every penny.

The staff was incredibly helpful and kind.  The breakfast buffet was amazing - be prepared to indulge!  Beautiful outdoor space you can relax and eat in.

We loved everything about it and won't look anywhere else on our next trip to Barcelona!",5,2016,03,07
13,Luxurious  Stay,"We were here for four wonderful nights and truly were treated like royalty.  From the time you walk in the door, the atmosphere is truly welcoming.  They give you a tour of the hotel telling of its wonderful history and beauty.  The breakfast every morning was served elegantly and the wait staff was both refreshing, lovely and polite. The concierge staff was some of the best we have found, always helpful and pleasant.  And yes the aroma in the hotel is beautiful.",5,2016,03,06
13,Cuando el efiicio es un lujo,"Si el edificio se mantiene dese 1879 impecable, el resultado no puede dejar de ser excelente. La nobleza de la compañia del algodon, sigue imprimiendo una categoria sublime a las instalaciones. El personal muy bien formado al servicio atencion al cliente, te hacen sentir que siempre has estado entre ellos. Es tu casa noble en Barcelona.
If yuo have a building like Royal Cotton Company from 1879, result it couldn't be more than excellence. Categority of Cotton Company still gives an awsome character to public areas and rooms. Staff has been good training in quality and service. They make you feel wonder, as you have been always a good customer. If you look for a Nobile Room in Barcelona, here you have!",5,2016,03,01
13,Charming property!,Absolutely charming hotel right in the heart of the city... We had a grand stay here. The rooms were a bit small but still much better than some we have encountered in Europe. The interiors and decor of the entire hotel is extraordinarily stunning! The staff was really clued in and suggested some great eateries and other tips. Great service too.,5,2016,02,29
13,Exceptionally good,"I have stayed at the Cotton House at least four times. The friendliness of the staff, the cleanliness of the rooms and the customer service is always excellent. Just a nice little touch which made me feel at home: I walked into my room after checking in and on the mirror was written in white marking pen: ""Welcome back to the Cotton House Experience."" Very nice. They do go out of their way to make you feel like you are family and that you are coming back home. 

One of the things I like so much about this property is the cleanliness of the rooms. Not just the sleeping rooms and bathrooms but all of the rooms in the hotel that guests have access to. You can tell it's a passion for them. I'm used to staying in 4 and 5 star hotels and even so, you can usually see dirt build up from the mop along sideboards where they just haven't paid attention to detail. Not at Cotton House. The place is very clean and they pay attention to detail. It's kind of like the Disneyland of hotels. Staff keeping the place clean and looking first class but not being intrusive. Memo to management: Keep up the good work. Your business model works and is much appreciated by the customer.

I took advantage of their spa services and got a massage. The hotel sub-contracts with a company who comes to the hotel. The massage was excellent. It was so good I got another one the following day. Claudia was the masseuse and she was truly a professional. I'll ask for her again next time I'm back.

This hotel is in a good location and walking distance to many of the major attractions. ",5,2016,02,28
13,The best in Barcelona ,"I have been coming to Barcelona yearly in the last decade and have stayed in  very good places.  I have to say Cotton House is simply the best.  Every inch of it is beautiful.  The staff was so accommodating of all my needs.  The bed,  clothed with the best cotton was heavenly.  I did not want to leave the hotel as the day started!!!  And will definitely be back.... ",5,2016,02,26
13,Boutique in the perfect location ,"Our first time in Barcelona and we were staying for five days.  We usually use well known hotel chains and thought we would try this Autograph property by Marriott. So glad we did.  The staff are so helpful. They gave us a tour of the property upon arrival. Any questions or help we needed on activities or restaurants the concierge staff were available to us.  

The basic guestroom is a little small but has all the necessary amenities.  We particularly like the separation of the sink from the water closet from the shower. 

The hotel restaurant/bar had enough variety for every type of taste.  A broad selection of cocktails, liquor, wines and beers. 

Best of all, it was a short walk to Placa Catalunya, a jump off point for most tours, entry to Las Ramblas, shopping and close to the Gothic quarter.  ",5,2016,02,23
13,Fantastic Hotel in Barcelona,"I just adored this hotel in Barcelona. After arriving exhausted from an overnight flight with no sleep,  I was completely taken care of even though I arrived well before check in. Everyone went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and well cared for and accommodated as soon as possible. This staff could not be more warm and friendly. The hotel is gorgeous and charming - loved everything about the decor. I've traveled all over the world and stayed in many hotels and found this one just so pleasant. Only regret is I couldn't stay longer!",5,2016,02,21
13,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff",Beautiful hotel.  My husband and I stayed two nights after a cruise and before we flew home. We wished we had stayed longer. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Every tourist site we wanted to visit was within a 20-25 minute walk.  Wifi worked well.  If we return to Barcelona we will definitely be staying at the Cotton House again.,5,2016,02,20
13,Look Below the Surface...,"The Cotton House Hotel has the appearance of being a modern and charming hotel.  The hotel and rooms have been renovated, while maintaining a boutique-type feel.  However, once the initial shine wears off, there a number of issues.

First, the rooms/floors have paper thin walls.  We could hear literally everything in the room next to us, whether it was a door closing or a full conversation.  Also, most rooms have little to no view of anything worth seeing (make sure you secure a room on the front side of the hotel).

Second, while this hotel is in Marriott's Autograph Collection, our experience as Marriott Gold status holders was very underwhelming in view of our numerous other stays at Autograph hotels (including the Boscolo hotels in Venice/Rome).  I understand that hotels have capacity constraints, but no room upgrade was offered or even mentioned during check in (even if no upgrade is available, most Marriott's are pretty upfront in conveying this information).  Additionally, the continental breakfast for Gold/Platinum members was by far the most underwhelming breakfast we have had at a Marriott in Europe.  For example, the Boscolo hotels offer full access to a substantial continental breakfast and allow you to order a hot item off the menu.  At a minimum, other Marriott affiliated hotels at least provide some sort of hot meal option (e.g., eggs).

Third, with the exception of the Concierge staff, the service at the Cotton House was very mediocre.  The hotel has a nice outdoor terrace at the back of the first floor, but when we tried to go sit outside, we were instructed that we were only allowed to do so if we were ordering drinks from the bar.  For such a well ranked hotel, we certainly expected better from the staff.

Fourth, the hotel has a pool/roof deck that was closed.  The pool being closed in February is completely understandable, but there is no reason to close the roof deck (and with no notice from the staff).

Now the positives:  the hotel is in a convenient location to see a lot of the sites in Barcelona and is close to several restaurants.  The Concierge recommended El Nacional (a short walk from the hotel), which was great - almost like an Spanish-themed Eataly.  The bathroom in our hotel room was nice of a European hotel, especially the large, glass-enclosed shower.  The terrace on the first floor also has some nice charm.

Overall, we would recommend staying elsewhere in Barcelona.  Our hotel stays are driven by our loyalty certain chains and the resulting benefits, but had we known about the Cotton House's indifference toward Marriott elite members, we would have shopped around more.  We will likely explore our options with Hilton/SPG next time we visit Barcelona.",3,2016,02,19
13,Stunning centrally located boutique hotel,"Stayed at The Cotton House Hotel for 6 days and will definitely return. From the minute you arrive you are treated like royalty. The decor is elegant yet sexy. My only minor complaint would be the size of the room. I booked the larger ""Egyptian"" category room w/balcony and it was not what I expected. It was just large enough to accommodate a king bed, sofa and desk and the ""balcony"" was simply a Juliet balconette with a window that opened out 1 inch (not even wide enough to stick your head out the window). But nonetheless, we were very pleased with the accommodations. The bed was one of the most comfortable that I've ever slept in and the bathroom was huge with double sinks and a large rain forest shower. The bar was fantastic and was a lovely way to end the evening with a cocktail. The staff throughout the hotel went out of their way to accommodate your needs and always greeted you with a friendly smile and warm reception. In addition, the location of the hotel is superb. It's 2 blocks away from the Passeig de Gracia Metro stop, and tons of shopping and restaurants within walking proximity. We were there for The Barcelona Half Marathon, and the race course ran right past the hotel which was fun. I highly recommend this hotel. The Cotton House Hotel will be the only place I stay when in Barcelona.",5,2016,02,19
13,Beautiful hotel! Friendly staff!,"This is a beautiful hotel! Make sure you check out the staircase and the library! The staff is extremely helpful and friendly! Reyes the bellman had a greeting and a smile every time we saw him. When we first arrived, he got our luggage out of the cab and gave us fresh water and a delicious bite of cake while checking in. He showed us to our room and gave us a tour! Being an American hotel, you can be sure you get conditioner, lotion, wash cloths, robes and a makeup mirror in your room! We just came from a hotel in Zaragoza and not all of these were provided and the staff there very unfriendly! The continental breakfast was more than the usual array and we were not disappointed! The bed was very comfortable! The hotel was centrally located and we walked to most attractions.",5,2016,02,18
13,"This is a very charming, quaint and grand historical hotel.","We booked a slightly larger room with a sofa couch.  With the high ceilings we were extremely comfortable.  The bathroom was quite roomy with double sinks and an incredible overhead shower.  Best of all was the bed, pillows and enough electrical outlets for all of our devices.  We felt really special coming back to the room after a long day of sightseeing.  Add the delicious and plentiful selection of breakfast buffet choices and we were set.  The entire staff from check in, concierge, valet, housekeeping and restaurant were pleasant and performed their duties with a smile.  Many were quite young and clearly still firmly in apprentice mode but the training seemed efficient and effective.  

The excercise room was small and limited.  I would have liked a treadmill, but the stationary bike was adequate.  

Barcelona is beautiful and so was our experience at the Cotton House.",4,2016,02,13
13,"Elegant, luxurious, friendly staff","The Cotton House Hotel has it all.  Comfort, service, elegance, location.  The rooms are large and comfortable, the bar is a fun place to relax, the location couldn't be better...and the smell...its intoxicating. You will love this hotel.  When we return to the beautiful city of Barcelona, there's no where else we would stay.",5,2016,02,13
13,Christmas visit,"Nice location (10 minutes walk from palca de catalunya linked every 10 minutes to both Airport Terminal with free wifi on board and USB charger - other cities learn !!). Great historical building on a busy avenue near several other hotels. We heard the guest in front of us had just been stolen his luggage when exiting the taxi but suspect this could happen anywhere in such a touristy city and hotel staff were actively helping with police declaration etc. beside lift, there is a great stair and hall behind reception which made the entire experience very 'boutique'. Room was also nice quiet despite facing avenue. Overall comfortable and nice hotel in a convenient location.",4,2016,02,13
13,Charming Hotel In Center of Barcelona,"What a great hotel.  From the moment you step inside you know you are somewhere special.  The common areas are wonderful.  The rooms are quite small but functional.  Breakfast was always a highlight.  Delicious with a perfect setting outside.  The rooftop pool is very very tiny, but welcomed all the same.  Staff friendly.",4,2016,02,10
13,Lovely hotel in great location,"Comfortable, well appointed room. Professional, friendly, very welcoming staff. Great breakfast, and the bar is a really pleasant place for an apero before venturing out for tapas - we tried at least three excellent places within 10 minutes walk. We also walked down Las Ramblas to Port Vell and back (about an hour and a half with a couple of stops for coffee), and to Sagrada Familia (about half an hour there). Gran Via is busy day and night, so if your room overlooks the front, it's worth having earplugs if you're a light sleeper. We'd definitely consider staying here again.",5,2016,02,10
13,"Very attentive staff, great place","Came to Barcelona with my boyfriend and we were told the cotton house was a lovely place to stay. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very dedicated. The bar and terrace are wonderful, I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to have a drink or afternoon tea in a relaxed setting. The staff was extremely preoccupied, and helped us in all aspects. Booking restaurants and giving directions as well as advising nice places to visit, everything was aided by the staff and we were very pleased. A young woman named Teresa helped us frequently during our stay, was very nice and always trying to make our stay more pleasant! Definitely recommending this to our friends. ",5,2016,02,07
13,Great atmosphere and even better service ,"I went to the cotton house to have a drink at the terrace. Asked for a cocktail and a glass of wine, both good and favourable in terms of price-quality relationship. I really liked the service, especially Jaksa, who was very attentive. He helped us pick out our drink and was very interested in our well being. I will repeat this experience, surely! ",5,2016,02,07
13,Wonderful Relais!,"We selected this Marriott property to try a change to the fantastic Hotel Arts.
We were in love with the room, layout and design and comfort!
Breakfast very nice, too!
We decided to go to the restaurant for dinner.
First we were told of no available space, but we were nevertheless given a table. When we came later for dinner we felt like sitting in a drafty train station cafe!
No charm, no ""warmth"".  Shame, really.
",5,2016,02,03
13,Fantastic,"This is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in.  The service was unbelievable.  We were not sure where we could park our rental car on the street, so the desk clerk valeted it for us.  The entire place smells like perfume (in a good way). Our room was on the smaller side, but it was so nice it more than made up for it.  There is no separation between the bathroom and bedroom if that matters to you. The pictures really speak for themselves.",5,2016,01,31
13,Sumptuous hotel amazingly friendly great location,"With only three days to spend in Barcelona we booked into The Cotton House hotel on Gran Via which is in the heart of the city. A few blocks from Placa Catalunya, La Rambla and that fabulous street Passage de Gracia. This hotel has the WOW factor. The staff are super helpful and friendly. The interior is designed sumptuously with sweeping staircases. Although the whole place exudes luxury and elegance the relaxed atmosphere within makes it a great place to sit and have anything from a coffee or cocktail to a delicious dinner. The breakfasts are out of this world ranging from hot which includes crepes to a table of cheeses hams etc and then a table with the biggest selection of cakes ever. The bedrooms are the essence of comfort and taste. The top terrace has a small pool and from it their is a great view over the city. Having stayed in Barcelona many many times this is now my favourite hotel. Treat yourself.",5,2016,01,30
13,Unbelievable service and amenities ,This is one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed at.  The staff were attentive and helpful and the hotel was incredible in the comfort and amenities. I cannot wait to go back to Barcelona and stay here again. ,5,2016,01,30
13,Stunning Historic Building finds new beginning as a wonderful hotel,"Perfect service nestled into a historic building - and most certainly the most comfortable sleep ever! The terrace is spectacular as is the spiral staircase. We stayed overnight en route to a business, the staff were friendly efficient, and the breakfast was excellent too.  I'd probably stick with the continental breakfast over the offer of a cooked omelette.  

And for Europe the water for the tea was just right.

When the staff popped in to turn the bed down, they replaced the complimentary shower soaps - nice touch and thoughtful",5,2016,01,28
13,Cotton on to this absolutely fabulous hotel!,"My husband and 19th year old daughter were in Europe from Sydney, and decided to come to Barcelona between Christmas and Ney Year,  and after looking at various hotels we chose Cotton House and booked a suite (so we could plonk our daughter on the sofa bed).  We checked in to this gorgeous building only to be given an amazing upgrade to a room with two bedrooms and a roof terrace... Plus a lovely bottle of wine and little sweetly treaties.  The amazing time we had continued for the four days .. Breakfast - fantastic, staff - superlative, service - exemplary, hotel - can you please adopt me?  Next time we/I am in the UK we shall be back - it was just delightful - thank you!",5,2016,01,24
13,Amazing Boutique hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,Been to Barcelona many times but Cotton House is definitely my favorite hotel.  The rooms are beautiful with amazing soft bed sheets that melts to your skin.  The rooms were a bit small but I didn't mind at all as I didn't really want to get out of soft cotton sheets. The restaurant is beautiful and the morning breakfast buffet was amazing and delicous. I will definitely come back to Cotton House next time I visit Barcelona.,5,2016,01,21
13,Top of the Line ,"This hotel is in a league of it's own. After a long trip from Canada I was hoping to check-in early. Gabriel checked me in with world class service, and Gave me a lovely upgrade. The bellman helped me to my room and told me all about it and the hotel. After checking in I wanted for nothing! The room was beautiful and well equipped, they thought about everything a traveller could want. The housekeeping staff were amazing, even when just coming across me in the halls. Every time I entered and exited the building I was greeted by the wonderful team with smiles and hellos. The only downside about this hotel was when I had to leave. I absolutely fell in love with Barcelona and the Cotton House, I cannot wait to go back. ",5,2016,01,18
13,"Excellent Service, Beautiful Hotel and Great Location","From the moment that we got out of the taxi we were impressed with this hotel.  We checked in, got all our bags to our room and met with a hotel concierge who help us map out our site seeing plans.  We opted to purchase the Sagrada Familia tickets and selected our time slot right there.  I would recommend purchasing them in advance so you do not have to wait in long lines, best thing we did.  The concierge representative did a great job mapping out the city and recommending the hop-on-hop-off buses that take you to each part.  She really made our trip to Barcelona great and this hotel was just fantastic to stay at.",5,2016,01,18
13,Stylish with a few annoyances,"Was recommended this new design/boutique hotel which opened less Han a year ago. 
Was certainly not disappointed with the overall design of the hotel's public areas. Really stylish mix of retro, old, antique and modern. The staff were fantastic and the bar and restaurant were great too. Food particularly was delicious and the service helpful and attentive without being over bearing. 
A few little bugbears. I had an ""inside"" room with a window into a light well. The room was stylish but v small and it made it a bit like a cell. Pillows were nasty synthetic  filled ones albeit with good bed linen. Why do hotels insist on putting a chest inside the wardrobe which basically stops you from hanging anything up? The his is the second ""luxury"" hotel I've been to where you literally can't hand more than a jacket down the side. This one actually had a kettle on the top of the drawers - so you could steam your clothes? And finally don't have room 511 unless you want the faint rumble of what sounded like thunder or elephants trotting whenever anyone used the running machine in the 24 hour gym directly above you. 

Overall I loved the hotel - Would just find a better room. ",4,2016,01,15
13,"Amazing Service, Beautiful Building and Great Location","I arranged for two friends to stay here for their honeymoon (it was a gift to them). Cotton House staff were really helpful in arranging this, enabling me to prepay. They let my friends check in really early (7am!!) upgraded them and put in so much effort to make them feel special. They brought up special treats to the room and even made a card for them to congratulate them on their wedding. My friends raved about the hotel and service.",5,2016,01,13
13,"Historic building, super comfortable beds, service par excellence","Tip: if you are using Marriott reward points this historic hotel is much better value than Hotel Arts Barcelona.
Nice location, within walking distance to Casa Batllo and the train station. This is a 19th century building converted to a luxury hotel.
Really comfortable beds (in fact the most comfortable bed I slept on during this trip in Spain), they have a nice topper that adds to the comfort. The beds were a real standout.
Beautiful decor and service was warm, friendly and efficient much better compared to the higher priced Hotel Arts Barcelona, where I found the service staff to be snooty but ineffectual.",5,2016,01,12
13,Great Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in December.  We decided to take the metro from the airport, which was only about 20-25 minutes.  Just buy the T10 ticket and it only comes out to a couple of bucks per person.  The stop is Passeig de Gracia, which was only about a 5-10 minute walk to the hotel depending on which exit you came out of.  

The location was very convenient as it was a short walk to the main shopping area on Passeig de Gracia, and some sites such as Casa Batllo and Casa Mila.  The Sagrada Familia was about a 30 minute walk, but you can easily metro it as well.  

The hotel is about a year old and was designed very nicely.  The rooms are a bit small, but that is expected in these types of hotels.  Overall, very comfortable with a nice bathroom.  We had the breakfast in the morning, which we thought was pretty good.  The service was top notch and they all spoke English well.  It was convenient to eat here since there aren't too many places right outside of the hotel.  

Great stay in Barcelona and would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2016,01,12
13,Perfect accommodations in a great city,"The Cotton House is a superbly executed conversion from a historic private residence into a small, comfortable and luxurious boutique hotel.  You feel welcome from the moment you enter the premises.  Staff is super friendly, the rooms are are well appointed and the facilities are good.  There are many public spaces with enough nooks and crannies to have meetings without being overheard.  There is a small rooftop pool, gym, huge patio and the breakfast buffet is hands-down the best I have ever sampled. Service is super attentive always delivered with a smile.  Ask for a room facing the rear, since the hotel is located on a busy road.  Ours had a balcony overlooking the large patio and was the perfect spot to do some last emails while the sun set.  Central Barcelona is a walking city and the hotel's location is perfect for exploring. The new Apple store is just minutes away and worth seeing as it is located on a main square in a historic building.  Shopping and great restaurants are a short walk away. Our only critical comment is the slippery shower base in our bathroom.  In summary, a highly recommended hotel in central Barcelona.",5,2016,01,11
13,"Impeccably designed hotel, great location","The first thing I noticed about this hotel was the interior design.  The furnishings, decorations, and style are beautiful and luxurious without being over-the-top.  Next, at check-in, the reservations system had some issues, so it took us awhile to get to our room.  We then had an issue with the room and had to go back to the front desk, but the staff were very professional and resolved our issue.

The stay overall was great.  The breakfast was heavy on the sweets but had a decent variety of food.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are nice and functional, and the nice interior decoration carries through there too.  The hotel also has a nice terrace with a small pool.  

The location is convenient to many attractions, including several of Gaudí's buildings in central Barcelona (Casa Milà/La Pedrera, Casa Batlló, and the Sagrada Familia), Las Ramblas, the shopping around Plaça Catalunya and Passeig de Gràcia, and also the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter).",4,2016,01,06
13,"Great Property,  Excellent Location,  Superior Staff","This is our family's second stay at the Cotton House.   It's an incredible hotel.   It has a great courtyard that is a perfect getaway from the lively local shopping and dining scene.   The location is really great,  an easy walk to the best shopping and dining in Barcelona.   It's also close to the port,  the Picasso museum, and the Cathedral.   Really a unique property,  a former cotton exchange then a family home (Estate) before being converted to a hotel.   We have stayed at several Autograph Collection hotels and this is one of our favorites.   Enjoy! ",5,2016,01,03
13,Perfect blend of Boutique Hotel details & Big Chain Hotel amenities,"The hotel is beautiful with excellent service. It's located walking distance from a lot of shopping & dining in Barcelona.  The staff is very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is luxurious without being stuffy at all! The restaurant's food is delicious, too!",5,2016,01,03
13,Faultless!,"Hotel was excellent, and only a ten minute walk from Las Ramblas. We visited for my girlfriend's birthday, and were presented with a beautiful complimentary birthday dessert and drinks upon arrival at our room! The interior of the hotel was very impressive, being a former tailor's guild. Room was modern and clean. Buffet breakfast was enjoyable, although the price reflected the star rating of the hotel.",5,2016,01,02
13,Gorgeous Design & Great Food!,"I arrived at the hotel with my husband after travelling for over 30 hours - so we opted to have dinner in the hotel instead of venturing out that evening.

We were not disappointed.  The food was fantastic.  Everything from Foie Gras Bon Bons to the BEST grilled vegetables I have ever had, along with some gorgeous desserts.  Service was attentive and informative as well.

Breakfast the next morning was lovely with loads on offer.  

We had an Egyptian Larger Guest Room with Balcony, which was spacious and clean.  
The decor of the hotel is stunning.  Warm, cosy and inviting.  

We loved it and would definitely return.",5,2016,01,01
13,Excellent ,"This is an excellent hotel.  So much thought must of been put into the needs of their guests. 
The room was beautiful and had so many extras and comforts. Lovely decor in keeping with the history of the building. 
The restaurant served amazing food - drink. Nothing seemed to much trouble for the staff. They had a genuine pride in everything they did. 
",5,2015,12,29
13,Beautiful Hotel,"Hotel is situated on the main street close to most major shopping areas. 

A beautiful hotel with wonderful staffs. Everyone of them from doorman to reception are very helpful and friendly. Made us feel welcomed.

Rooms are small but we'll decorated and cozy. Which makes up for it's size.

Room Tip : It's worth while to get a room with a balcony. 

",5,2015,12,24
13,"Beautiful, hospitable hotel","Location was perfect - not right on top of everything so you could get away from the hustle and bustle, but certainly within walking distance to the main sights. 
Room and communal areas were beautiful, loved the touches like the Cotton Tree in the front desk area. We had a 'madras room' overlooking the Main Street which was beautiful and could hardly hear the traffic. Decor was immaculate, loved the walk in shower/bath. 
Lovely touch to be offered a tour and history of the hotel after we'd checked in. Front desk very helpful providing us with maps and explaining how to get to the sights. 
Whole team very personable - greeting you around the hotel but at the same time allowing privacy. 
I have to say one of my favourite things, weirdly, was the smell in the corridors! I would love to bottle that for my own house!
Thank you so much for a truly wonderful 4 nights. ",5,2015,12,21
13,Fabulous ,"Simply fabulous, an outstanding hotel, centrally located in the Eixample area with 2 metro stations nearby. The staff are extremely helpful. The rooms are well equipped and a good size and decorated to a high standard. The entrance and main foyer really impressive this time of the year a Cotton reed Christmas tree beautiful.",5,2015,12,18
13,Beautiful Property and Great Service,This is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Barcelona. The staff was very friendly and great to visit with. Their recommendations for restaurants and events was spot on. The bartender made awesome drinks and had a great personality. A truly enjoyable stay!,5,2015,12,17
13,Hidden Gem in a Beautiful City!,"My best friend and I spent a wonderful week in BCN and this was our 2nd hotel of three while we were there.  After leaving the W Barcelona, we were saddened as we loved everything about it.  Luckily, the Cotton House Hotel was captivating from the moment we stepped foot through the doors!  The staff was superb! They were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the city.  The aroma that greeted us was simply amazing. It was my friend's 35th birthday and I had booked a day at the beautiful ancient baths spa but had no clue how to get there.  The front desk staff was kind enough to volunteer to print directions, a map, etc.  They were an integral part in making my best friend's birthday unforgettable.  The Hotel was beautiful, quaint, and luxurious.  The room was smaller than some but I loved everything about it!! From the comfy beds to the insane walk-in closet, to the beautiful decor.  I will definitely stay at The Cotton House Hotel on my next visit to Barcelona. Please let me add that one of the male front desk staff was so kind as to even hold my friends stilettos at the front desk while we walked up the street for food.  When we returned to go out he was right there like a Prince Charming to make sure she had her sexy mama shoes. :) ",5,2015,12,16
13,Great hotel and location!!,"This is a beautiful hotel!!   Off the beaten path but right on the main thoroughfare, great location as we were able to walk to all the central city locations, from Gracia to the Bari Gothic, to Barceloneta, to the Sagrada, and many more.  Since it was the off season, the hotel was very quiet and private...we felt like we were the only guests there.  The staff is so attentive and friendly, and the room was very comfortable.  I highly recommend this hotel",5,2015,12,14
13,Beautiful Building - Very good location,"The architects of the Cotton House have made a very enjoyable space from the old cotton building.  They have incorporated old cotton fabrics as decoration, used old invoices from the business as wall paper, and made some excellent public rooms.  The two staircases - one spiral and the other marble - are both spectacular.  The hotel location is very good - about three blocks from the main shopping street, about 10 minutes walk to Las Ramblas and Casa Mila.  The comfort of the room was excellent - naturally using fantastic cotton sheets and towels.  The staff went out of their way to be helpful and provide guidance.  The best part was the included breakfast in the beautiful dining room. The breakfast choices were extraordinary, especially the pastries.  We stayed four days and enjoyed ever minute.",5,2015,12,11
13,A can't miss luxury experience in the heart of the city,"This is a boutique hotel in a great area that is accessible to all the sites in the city. The dining is fantastic and would recommend the monkfish. The breakfast dining option is in a great terrace and the options are varied and excellent .The courtyard setting of some of the rooms are reminiscent of old world charm. However, the best part of the hotel is all the staff and the hotel manager Alfredo whom is so passionate about guest experience.",5,2015,12,09
13,Dream Space,"Absolutely fabulous.  Repurposing of a cotton exchange into an elegant, exquisite hotel paying homage to its roots.  Decor fabulous. Rooms chic but very functional for more than a one night stay. Staff attentive and smart.  Location perfect; just just off the touristy route. You could walk almost anywhere in the city you wanted to go.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding.  We ate there 5 mornings and never got bored.  A real gem. I'd say it was perfect.  ",5,2015,12,05
13,A Five & Then Some,"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. We stayed 5 nights before a cruise.  
Staff-excellent-We were met at the curb with a smiling face. 
Room-We had a Madras room on the street with a view of Sagrada Familia.  Good bed with thick sheets. We found it quiet when the window was closed.  Not a gigantic room, but plenty of space.
This is a small hotel that is beautiful.
Restaurant-Could stand alone.  We had dinner one night,and breakfast every morning. May write a separate review of it.
Breakfast is included for Gold elites and up.  
The hotel has quiet patio in the back that offers a serene refuge in the city
Location-perfect  It is a few blocks from Cataluna  Plaza. We walked all the way down LaRambla to the port and had dinner there.  Also walked to Sagrada Famalia.  
I have over 1000 hotel nights and I will absolutely say at this hotel if I should ever pass this way again. 
",5,2015,12,04
13,Stunning hotel,"I had the privilege of staying at Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona for a couple of days last week.  It's a stunning hotel - the public spaces are beautiful with just the right amount of design working with the old modernista building (a bit of a rarity in this city where too many hotels are over-designed).   I had a 'Cotton Room' which - to push a metaphor - had a very high thread count for me:  super comfortable, HUGE bed, great amenities, wet room and sunny balcony overlooking a central courtyard.  Service was very friendly and smooth, the bar a joy to have a gin and tonic in and the breakfast buffet spectacular (I could have grazed for hours).  I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,12,01
13,Fabulous Experience and Beautiful Hotel,"This had to be one of the very best hotel experiences I've ever had. (I do travel often). From the time we arrived (early) they were very accommodating since we had just arrived from a cruise. They offered us an upgrade as our room wasn't ready. They were extremely helpful with directing us and booking us to go see Sagrada Familia as there are a lot of places closed on Sundays, including the supermarkets. They also, had fantastic bar service, friendly front desk, bellman, concierge and all around. Perfect restaurant suggestion for us and they made us a reservation for a hard to get into place for authentic food from Spain. (Botafumeiro - another excellent choice) It was our last day of our fantastic 10 year anniversary trip of a lifetime. I wish I had stayed there before my cruise as well. I will be back. Fantastic experience overall. Thank you for making it so special for us. The interior was a beautiful and the hotel is under a year old.",5,2015,11,30
13,Amazing hotel,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - ignore any other 5 star reviews I have given for any other 4 or 5 hotels as they do not compare.  
This hotel is amazing.  From the second you arrive at the front door you are greeted and your suitcase is taken off you (and not in an uncomfortable manner). At reception you are, again, warmly greeted and given a drink whilst you are checked in. 
The room we stayed in (306) was completely adequate for our needs during our stay.  Large bed, spread out bathroom, spacious bath and shower area.  It was my husband's 40th birthday and the hotel helped me arrange a few surprises for him upon entry to the room - it was highly appreciated and my husband was very grateful.  The birthday card the hotel left was also a nice touch. 
We had a drink in the library and again service was excellent without being smothering or uncomfortable.  
Breakfast in this hotel is wonderful - plenty of choice.  Hot food made to order and you can mix and match from the different options.  Cold meats, fruit, pastries (OH WOW THEY ROCK), fruit juices and hot drinks. 
I honestly cannot recommend this hotel enough.  It was a delight to be in from start to finish and my only regret was we could not spend longer here. I will be back anytime I visit as nothing else would, in my opinion, compare.",5,2015,11,30
13,Excellent stay in beautiful hotel,"Stayed at the cotton house for five nights. My wife had stayed earlier in the summer when she brought my son over to start his exchange. She couldn't stop raving about it so we stayed this past week when we visited for thanksgiving. 

Beautiful building. Restoration and interior were stunning. Great rooms. Lovely breakfast, nice library for afternoon tea and a great bar for a nightcap. 

Staff were exceptional and all spoke perfect English. 

A real find in Barcelona for a stay with character. 

Couldn't recommend it more ",5,2015,11,27
13,Hotel with character,"Stayed one night.  Upgraded to a small suite that was beautiful. It had high ceilings that were nicely decorated, as was the rest of the room. Bathroom had a separate tub and shower with lots of storage. Breakfast was very good quality and nice selection. Service was generally very good (concierge helpful in booking a dinner reservation).  It take two calls to get some coffee delivered, but otherwise good stay. ",5,2015,11,27
13,We recommend.,"We enjoyed our 6 day stay at the Cotton House. This is a Marriott, Autograph Collection Hotel, and is more like a boutique hotel and less like a typical Marriott. 

We found the location to be perfect. Close enough to walk to most places for dinner, and easy enough to get a taxi when our feet ached from walking too much. Very centrally located about 2 1/2 blocks from Passeig de Gracia and about a 10-15 minute walk to Bario Gotic.

The public spaces are beautifully done.You walk into the hotel on the ground floor and see a reception desk on one side and some comfortable couches on the other. One flight up are  most of the public spaces. There is a beautifully appointed library/lounge area,  where you could have drinks and snacks, and a center room where the Concierge (called gossypium) help guests and a beautiful restaurant/bar area. Outside the restaurant area is an outdoor lounge in a Courtyard, although it was a little to cold for us to enjoy it while we were there. The transformation of a former Cotton trade association to this hotel was done with great artistry and beauty. On the top floor of the hotel is a small pool and sitting area. 

The rooms facing the Courtyard have balconies and seemed to be quieter. Our room faced the street, which was noisier,  but the soundproofed windows blocked out most of the street noise, and we had a nice view. We had no problem with a very low hum from the very bust street. If you really want quiet I would suggest to ask for a room in the back

The rooms, while nicely appointed were more basic, but still very comfortable. Very comfortable bed, and linens.  Our room had a big walk in closet, and a bathroom with two sinks and a stall shower. One minor troubling aspect is that although the hotel is less than a year old, the bathroom  already showed some signs of wear and tear, such as worn glaze on the tiles, and some falling of the ceiling over the shower. The rooms  did not seem to have the same care and detail as the public spaces at the hotel. (The rooms were more like a nicely done Marriot than the rest of the hotel.) Nevertheless, even this minor negative, would not keep us from returning when in Barcelona. The only other negative would be the spotty Wi-Fi. It was not the best and did not seem to cover the entirety of the hotel--it was constantly cutting in and out.

The staff were superlative and are really one of the major attributes of this hotel. Every one, to a person, was friendly, helpful and very enthusiastic about the hotel, their job and ensuring our visit was enjoyable.  Gracias to all those we spoke with.

We ate breakfasts and 2 dinners at the restaurant Batuar. The breakfasts had a large selection of buffet items, and allowed you to order eggs and other items from the menu for the same charge. We enjoyed our dinners as well. The gossypium recommended  some excellent restaurants/ tapas bars within walking distance to he hotel and these were outstanding.

We highly recommend this beautiful hotel. We would indeed stay here again if in Barcelona.",5,2015,11,27
13,"Wonderful location, staff and decor !","Just got back from 5 evenings here and this is what a Boutique Hotel should be. 
I have Gold status with Marriot and was upgraded to a 6th floor King room with a nice view.
  The breakfast was exceptional, with a great variety of all types of fruits , cold cuts, cheeses ,salmon, cereals and many different pastry's and sweets.
They didn't miss any group of breakfast  foods .
  All the Staff were especially pleasant and remembered our names as they greeted us through different areas of the Hotel. 
 The Library is a wonderful place if you want peace and quiet, and they serve coffee and tea throughout all the common areas.
I injured my wrist early on , and everyone was concerned and asked about my health for the next few days.
 The best words to  describe the staff would be  "" sweet "" and competent.
Its the perfect location very close to the Placa Catalunya , Cortes Engles , Passeig De Gracias Los Rambla etc . Looking forward to returning",5,2015,11,27
13,A wondeful colonial touch,"I stayed 2 nights at the Cotton House Hotel mid-November and I really enjoyed my stay. As you probably know the hotel is the former headquarters of the Cotton Textile Foundation “Fundación Textil Algodonera”. The preservation and renovation works are outstanding and the result is stunningly gorgeous. My room 512 ""Egyptian Room"" was on the 5th floor overlooking Gran Via. Though overlooking this busy street, I could not hear any noise as the  soundproofed windows are excellent ! I had a big dressing room. Nice bathroom with big Italian shower (it was fine for me as I'm not a fan of bathtub). Check-in was quick and professional. I did enjoy the welcome drink. The library and the different living room/salons located on the 1st floor are just an invitation to relax. I particularly enjoyed the one called ""l'Atelier"" which was the office were the tailors were taking measurements of their clients. The concierge area ""the Gossypium"" is a beautiful area on the way to the restaurant ""Batuar"". I had dinner one night. Nice area but nothing memorable in terms of food. The main decoration theme is cotton. From the beautiful cotton plant arrangement at the reception, the cotton flower mural painting in the rooms, but the most original idea is the fabric sample book laid upon the desk in the room. There is a small terrace and pool on the last floor. The hotel is within easy walking distance from Gotic Center, Paseo de Gracia and all major attractions in the center. I will return to Cotton House.",5,2015,11,27
13,"Great location in the city, excellent service.","Easy walk to las ramblas, metro, and shopping.  If you don't mind walking further, you can walk to Sagrada Familia, the waterfront, etc as well.  Cabs are plentiful and easy to flag down.

Rooms are well appointed.  Plenty of electric outlets.  I'm not a huge fan of the waterfall shower head but a lot of people like that.

The breakfast that is included for marriott elites is not bad, but it's in the local style and heavy on cured meats and sweet carbs.  There is a little bit of fruit, but not much, no eggs to speak of other than some little quiche type items.  Not sure if I'd pay for this if it weren't included as I'm not a big breakfast eater in general.

Note that rooms with balconies all face the courtyard, which isn't a great view, as you're just seeing the backs of other buildings (including residential units that have laundry hanging out).  On the other hand, the city view rooms will get more street noise.",4,2015,11,23
13,Best hotel experience on our European trip,"From the moment we arrived the staff was warm and welcoming.  We were provided water and candy before even arriving at the check in desk.  Our bell hop didn't ask if we wanted help with our bags, he just took them from the cab and waited for us to check in.  He then walked us up to our room and proceeded to show us where everything was (even down to the receptacles for our phone chargers).  The Concierge was amazing and provided all the information we needed to start enjoying this wonderful city.  Cocktails at the bar were high end and very generous.  the breakfast buffet was extensive and delicious!  the hotel was also just beautifully decorated.  We will stay here again and again!",5,2015,11,22
13,Disappointing,"Despite a large junior suite, someone forgot to advise the interior designer that closets and bureaus should accommodate a traveler's wardrobe. We couldn't believe that in our spacious rooms, that the closet measured fifteen inches and there wasn't a dresser in the bedroom, just a few shelves shared with the wine and tea accessories. A tiny fitness enter was very nice but the pool was cold and on the wrong side of the street to get sun! The service in the restaurant left a lot to be desired and the food was ridiculously expensive. Although the staff tried hard, they could not compensate for the lack of attention to details that is assumed in a luxury hotel. Marriott has a long way to go with this one, especially in a city known for architecture and an abundance of fine hotels.",3,2015,11,21
13,BEST HOTEL EVER,I travel for business every week and stay at over 50 hotels a year. This hotel is by far the best hotel I've stayed at. Better then the Ritz or any other 5 star hotel. The staff was so friendly and so accommodating. They really go out of there way to make you feel special. If you were to go to heaven this would be the hotel in heaven.,5,2015,11,20
13,Very pleasant hotel.,"My wife and I stayed for three nights this week and the room was excellent. Lovely decor, good sized bath and superb overhead shower.Spotlessly clean, comfortable bed. The balcony was small and looked out on to some building work but it was still nice to get some early morning sun.
The restaurant and bar are very stylish but the food is too expensive! Buffet breakfast was €52 for the two of us for which there appeared to be no cereals or toast. That might be OK for a lot of travellers but is it only the Brits that expect this. Oh, and a decent cup of tea seems to be impossible. I shared a few words with a guy on the table next to me as he was served what was supposed to be Breakfast Tea but was just mildly discoloured water. I also had a problem with my burger in the evening but rather than cook a fresh one I was given the original put back in to the part eaten bun! NOT great service for a top priced restaurant.
However I would recommend this hotel.If you want to be close enough to all the shops and various tourist attractions it is ideally situated,but look elsewhere for your food.",4,2015,11,20
13,Great Hotel Staff,"We stayed at the Cotton House Hotel for four nights during our vacation to Barcelona. The hotel was five star with small but beautifully appointed, well designed rooms, great restaurant and beautiful inside/outside lounge. The hotel also has a great location in the L'Eixample section of Barcelona, convenient to metro, great restaurants and attractions. However, stay here because the hotel has an absolutely outstanding staff. They were the most friendly, inviting  and knowledgeable staff that we have experienced anywhere in Europe. All of the individuals at the concierge, front desk, restaurant staff and maid service were just extraordinary. ",5,2015,11,19
13,Absolutely incredible,"Very simply, Cotton House is the best all-around hotel I have ever had the honor of staying in.  It is a beautiful facility with a truly amazing staff and an excellent location within walking distance of everything we wanted to see.  Everyone is warm and friendly and will go out of their way to take care of you.  Carolina and the concierge staff are excellent.  She handled recommendations and reservations at restaurants for us and when you arrived, you would have thought we were royalty.  The doormen went above and beyond to get taxi's that could handle the six of us in our party.  They arranged our airport transfers, assisted with train transportation and made certain everything was perfect.  The wait staff in the restaurant and the bar made us truly feel important.  I cannot say enough.  I travel for a living and spend 1 out of every 3 days in a hotel.  This one, I did not want to leave.",5,2015,11,17
13,Best luxury Hotel,"My friend & I stayed here for 5 nights. Superior King room; quiet and window allows air in the room if you wish. Very firm mattress; great linens & pillows. Large bathroom with great fluffy towels & fine bath gel;shampoo/conditioner. 
What is most memorable about this Hotel is the staff. They are Professional, eager to help; very courteous; remember you name & always helpful & cheerful. You are welcomed back to the hotel & asked if you have any immediate needs. The concierge service is superb with excellent suggestions. We didn't dine there but the food is beautifully presented in a gorgeous setting. Newly renovated old building is gorgeous.All anyone could ask for is available at this hotel, including a pool & spa. It.s a must visit.",5,2015,11,14
13,"Very good hotel, one of the best showers - ever","Excellent location in the city centre, very nice rooms and attentive staff. Didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food but there is a really nice outside decking area in the well stocked bar.",4,2015,11,12
13,Perfect!,"Very good location: central but at the same time quiet.
The ambiance is just amazing, very colonial. The decor is something out of this world. The room was nice, with a great bathroom but not much closet space is provided. The breakfast is fantastic! And staff very helpful. When visiting Barcelona, I will stay there again for sure!",5,2015,11,11
13,Outstanding Boutique Marriott,"Really nice boutique-style hotel in Central barcelona.  The hotel itself is very tastefully done - a historic Barcelona building that's been treated tastefully.  The room itself was very nice - nespresso machine in the room a good touch (although just having one caffeinated pod seemed a bit mean...) 

The staff were all great - every morning when I returned back from my run I was immediately offered an apple and a bottle of water...and I felt this attitude percolated into everything they did.

I booked this as I usually stay in Marriotts when traveling - frankly I was surprised at how nice it was! The newer Autograph Collection properties seem to be really over achieving, both their brand and the price point.

The best thing though was the restaurant. When I arrive tired and jetlagged at a hotel, I just really want half decent food as quickly as possible (followed, quickly, by a comfortable bed).  The food was really top notch - if you were told the restaurant had a michelin star you wouldn't be surprised - I had salmon tartare followed by oxtail canneloni - both dishes were well executed - a little fussy maybe but not offputtingly so.  The bread was dangerously good.  The wine by the glass was also good - although frankly one expects this in Barcelona...

All in all - a rare treat which exceeded my expectations. I shall recommend it to everyone I know who travels to Barcelona...",5,2015,11,11
13,Great boutique hotel near everything ,"A unique small hotel that is near luxury. Excellent staff that speaks English and works hard to make sure you you enjoy Barcelona. Great breakfast. Can walk to most of the best to see in the city. Excellent concierge!  Rooms are so cozy and decorated with the cotton heritage of the hotel. 
",5,2015,11,09
13,Beautifully restored hotel,"The location of this hotel is excellent.  Easy walking distance to city center, shops and restaurants. It's apparent that all the staff enjoy working there and are very proud of their workplace. The beds and linens are phenomenal. We enjoyed our little balcony and also the outdoor terrace. ",5,2015,11,08
13,Classy hotel not too far from major sites,"The Cotton Hotel is in an old cotton exchange building just off the central square in Barcelona. It has all the amenities although we did not eat breakfast there. The rooms are clean and quiet, especially as it is on a fairly busy street. The staff was very personable and helpful...something we did not find routinely at other hotels we stayed at in Spain.There is a small mini mart just around the corner for any simple needs, but you will have to walk a few meters to get the restaurant district. It is a 5-10 minute walk to La Rambla walking street...highly recommended!",5,2015,11,07
13,"Boutique Hotel in great location with good service and a great, outdoor bar","Stayed 3 nights in this hotel, which is in a great location.  Just opened in February, heavily staffed with friendly, attentive service.  Rooms were very nice, smallish but fine (we were in the lower priced rooms).  Breakfast buffet was expansive and very good.
Highlight is the outdoor bar/patio, with much greenery and comfortable seating.  Highly recommend visiting the outdoor bar,  even if you are not staying here.  For the location, service and amenities, it is a great value.",5,2015,11,07
13,Exceptional property and staff,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay. From the time we arrived our expectations were exceeded. Sergio greeted us and facilitated our check in. He checked on our lost luggage daily. The hotel is beautifully restored and decorated.  The rooms spacious and comfortable.  The outside dining was so special. Food was excellent in preparation,taste and presentation. The wine and cava selection very good, Luigi was so helpful.  Thank you to the  staff and management for a delightful experience.  ",5,2015,11,04
13,Beautiful place! Unsurpassed service!,"Having been blessed to visit many great hotels, I can honestly say that the Cotton House Hotel is one of our favorites. Imediatley upon check in we were impressed with the staff and the attention that we received. Although our room was not ready, all efforts were made to make sure that we were not inconvenienced. When we eventually went to our room, we were not disappointed. We had a great view of the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and although we were on a Main Street, our room was quiet and provided excellent comfort. The staff paid particular attention to cleanliness. Breakfast was excellent for me, but my wife would have preferred less pastries/desserts and more hot dishes. The assistance we received from the staff cannot be over stated. Whether booking events with the concierge, asking for directions, or having our airline tickets printed, the staff was phenomenal. Yes, some were still in the learning stages, but their lack of experience was surpassed by their eagerness to assist and make sure that you were being taken care off. Paula at the front desk was especially helpful, always cheerful, patient and going over and above to ensure your satisfaction. I would definitely rank this an excellent were it not for the automatic charge to my credit card for potential incidentals, which in today's world should not be an issue, once the credit card has been verified. Frankly, although it was explained, and would be reversed if not incurred, I was surprised that it was a practice.  Although this could be described as an emergency charge just in case, the fact is that other similar hotels I have been to in the past couple of years did not feel it was necessary to do so. Consideration should be given to eliminating this practice. Nevertheless we had a great time and definitely recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.",4,2015,11,04
13,Luxury boutique hotel,"We arrived at the hotel after a cruise around 9.30 am not expecting to get a room. However, not only did they check us in, but upgraded us to a Cotton room from a Madras.  The room was beautiful, spacious and luxurious. The bed was so comfy, like we were sleeping on cotton candy! The shower was spacious and the rain shower a dream! The only negative thing was the shower stall floor was not tiled' nor did it have a rough surface. It was so slippery after our shower, we had to hold on to the walls and walk so slow! However, when we mentioned it to the staff, they provided us with a rubber mat which worked well. Maybe this is something the management should provide to all guests! The service was great, concierge helpful, and the dining room superb! We had dinner one night at the Batura, and the food was delicious!. Bottom line, a great find in a great location!",5,2015,11,04
13,Absolutely gorgeous hotel,"Stayed a  few nights in this lovely hotel.  It has a fascinating history and the rooms are lovely.  It is within walking distance of most attractions.  The service was unsurpassed and special kudos go to one of the employees - Carlo Lasorte - who sat with us for quite a while explaining the various events and shows that were going on during our visit.  He even went to get his computer to show us some of the events and booked us for evening tickets to an incredible show - GranGala Flamenco.  We travel to Barcelona frequently to see how the Sagrada Familia is ""coming along""!",5,2015,11,02
13,Boutique hotel well situated run by professionals,"Can't say enough about the hospitality staff at this hotel. They are an international bunch with impeccable manners. The hotel is charming and intimate completely opposite of a ""big box"" property. Sometimes taxi drivers will not know this property just tell them next door to the Palace hotel. We had a standard room which was quite comfortable. Each evening turndown included a welcome bottle of water. The hotel is a work of art right down to the spiral staircase!",5,2015,10,31
13,One night in Barcelona,"Great hotel.  Excellent location and service.  Terrace bar was very nice.  Some issues with wifi and TV but location, service and room made it easy to forgive shortcomings!
Hotel is within walking distance of many sites in Barcelona.  Concierge was very helpful with directions and got us reservations at a great, reasonably priced tapas spot.",5,2015,10,29
13,Magnificent Boutique Hotel,"I chanced on the Cotton House via the Marriott app when our prior hotel has already booked; we had decided to return to Barcelona instead of another destination. This is a magnificently restored building with strict attention to the history and culture of the Barcelona cotton barons and the society they built (albeit with tolerance of slavery in the Americas). The staff was extremely attentive, meeting us at the door with a glass of lemonade on check in. The room is not huge but is beautifully appointed and truly meets five-star standards. The rooftop has a nice little pool and a view of the city leading down to the sea, including Sagrida Familia and other landmarks. All amenities were up to standards, and the staff checks the room more than once a day to insure they are replaced and available including at bedtime. Ask the concierge for a tour of the building if you are interested in history or architecture and do not miss a visit to the second floor lobby and restored library. We visited several high quality hotels in Spain and Andorra during this trip, and the Cotton House is definitely at the top of our list (with the Palacio del Retiro in Madrid.) Literally the only problem we had was a little slow wifi upon arrival which fixed itself later in the day and was fast enough to download TV episodes. I have noted a few complaints about the breakfast service, which we did not take so I cannot comment there. Perfect location for the architectural and history buff visiting Barcelona. ",5,2015,10,27
13,Wonderful hotel; great place to stay in Barcelona,"This hotel is beautiful, the staff is wonderful and the rooms are very nice.  It was my birthday during our stay and my husband called ahead and they arranged to have roses my husband bought in my room when I arrived and they provided wine and some dessert as well.  Th e lobby and dining area are very nicely decorated and the continental breakfast was very good.  The location was also great.",5,2015,10,26
13,Historic hotel with great little extras,"My husband and I very much enjoyed this hotel for a two night stay pre cruise.  The hidden little gem is the bartenders for a nightcap.  If you so enjoy, you Must sit at the small bar and watch the bartenders at work.  I have NEVER seen such detail in every element of a cocktail.  Totally impressive.  I believe Jonathan was the man at work the night we enjoyed the details of his craftsmanship.  Be sure and take the tour of the history of the hotel.  As with European hotels they have small rooms, but cleanliness is more important and this hotel has it.
As stated in other reviews the complimentary breakfast is very good.  And yes the service is sporatic.
I didn't realize the difference in the areas of Barcelona and if you want to stay in more of a historic section look for the Gothic District.   If not this is a fantastic choice.",5,2015,10,26
13,Wonderful exquisite yet not exactly perfect ,"It's a magnificent boutique hotel part of the Marriott chain 

It's just a gem but silly policies caused some minor irritation. 

Checking in a holding on my credit card 100 euros per night toward future hotel charges ( on a pre paid room yet) seemed excessive 

Further at the beautiful breakfast they charge extra for some items which seemed churlish 

Last but not least as a Marriott lifetime platinum premier I am supposed to be upgraded to the best available room in the house 

Proudly the staff told me of my two room upgrade level which was nice but not what I had imagined 

The balcony and the courtyard were delightful 

Really liked the hotel ",4,2015,10,26
13,Amazing Boutique Hotel!,"Absolutely amazing! An incredible place if you're looking for a hotel with some character and wonderful accommodations--the hotel has pretty much everything you could ask for. The location was perfect--we could walk to all the major attractions in the city and the hotel staff was very accommodating in getting us cabs when we needed them. Front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful with our bags and knowledgeable of great recommendations around town. Every detail of the room was on point. We had a Cotton room for the week and it was rather roomy for European standards--the hotel does a great job in maximizing the space it has. The common spaces are absolutely stunning and one of a kind--a great change of pace to the vast majority of Marriott properties and their major brands. Great breakfast spread that we took advantage of all week (free if you're a Marriott rewards Gold or higher member) with the only hitch that the staff at the restaurant seem to still be working out some of the finer details--some days took rather long to get seated when tables were clearly available and service for non buffet items were sometimes very slow. Nothing major, but just something to anticipate. Overall, would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone!",5,2015,10,25
13,"Wonderful new hotel, excellent location, great conceirge staff let down by inconsistent service at breakfast","There is a great deal to like about this hotel. It is new and has been sympathetically established in an old cotton exchange/gentlemans Club. The fitout is opulent and holds the grandeur of its former life.

Location wise - most attractions are either within walking distance or public transport to reach them is close by.

The reception and concierge staff were excellent. Very helpful in advice and assisting in making on line bookings to avoid the crowded lines.

Our room was quiet and comfortable (even though it front the busy Gran Via), with all the amenities that you expect in a quality 5 star hotel. Sleep quality was excellent in a bed we would be happy to take home.

The only area of inconsistency was breakfast. It is located on the 1st floor in what would have to be one of the most splendid locations. You could just sit and soak up the atmosphere. The breakfast buffet is just as wonderful with a vast array of wonderful things to tempt and to experience.  However, there is a but, and that ""but"" was inconsistent service.  Over 4 mornings the service ranged from ""better than you would want and expect"" to the exact opposite, with a good and a very good day to make up the pack. This service inconsistency cost them the final ""star"" in my book. To be fair the hotel duty manager listened to the feedback of the ""poor"" day and we noted dramatic improvement the following day. However, in a hotel of this standard this shouldn't happen or be necessary.

Would I stay there again - absolutely. They deserve the benefit of the doubt and we all know that places can have their good and bad days.

At the end of the day this is an elegant and charming hotel.

13,Terrific Property,"Great location, next to the Ritz and a block from the main square.   Wonderful, well decorated rooms, terrific staff, the outdoor patio area is a wonderful break from the city.   Breakfast buffet is extensive and good.  The property draws upon its classic history, but is upgraded to contemporary standards.  Opened in February 2015",5,2015,10,23
13,The best place to stay in Barcelona!,"Everything about this hotel was on point. Very comfortable beds, quiet rooms, and wonderful staff.  The very best part, however, is the location.  We walked everywhere we wanted to go; easy and enjoyable way to explore the city.  The staff is happy to help with any questions you might have or to arrange tours or tickets to museums or the Sagrada Familia",5,2015,10,22
13,A Jewel of a Hotel,"If you plan a trip to Barcelona, the Cotton House Hotel is a wonderful place to stay. The staff is both professional and friendly. They understand they are there to make your stay not just pleasant but memorable. From the front desk to the concierge service they strive to make your vacation plans a reality. 

The European-sized rooms are clean and extremely comfortable. Our mattress and pillows felt like we were sleeping on air. We wish we had them at home as we can't remember the last time we slept so well. It was also nice to have a balcony with the perfect amount of privacy. 

The public spaces are beautifully appointed. They blend traditional decor and hardwoods with modernist elements creating the perfect Barcelona ambience. The impressive spiral staircase looks like an art instillation rather than a functional element. 

Consider the restaurant for more than breakfast. It was one of the best places we ate. (And we are foodies) From the delicious flavors, to the beautiful food styling, every plate was a feast for both stomach and eyes. The chocolate dusted foie gras bon-bons wrapped in gold foil and presented in a clear candy box hit all the flavor notes. The waitstaff was most attentive and knowledgable about every aspect of the menu. 

While they have an extensive wine list, consider a cocktail. The hotel employs two of the best mixologists in the city. It's quite something to watch their creative flare. Then comfortably enjoy your drink on the open-air patio under the massive palms and banana trees among the blooming bird-of-paradise. 

Staying at the Cotton House Hotel was an experience we will never forget. We are so glad we found it on TripAdvisor. What a beautiful little Barcelona jewel of a hotel this is. ",5,2015,10,21
13,Overcharged and disrespected,"First, I am a very dedicated Marriott customer that travels for business throughout the US. Currently I have more than 300,000 points with Marriott and average about 50 nights per year for me and my accompanying staff has similar loyalty. 

I made the reservation with the Cotton House for a weekend in October. Because my travel plans were fluid, I opted to stay at a Marriott property based on the cancellation policy. The reservation very clearly and specifically stated I would be charged 156.50 EU. 

Rate and Cancellation Details

•	You may cancel your reservation for no charge until Thursday, October 8, 2015 (2 day[s] before arrival).
•	Please note that we will assess a fee of 156.50 EUR if you must cancel after this deadline.

HOWEVER, I was charged 660 EU. The explanation I received was that I cancelled the room after Oct 8th and that was the best rate. The further tried to explain that points could not be used but no explanation for why the cancellation notice/warning I received when I cancelled the room explicitly stated the fee would be 156.50. 

Had I known I would be charged for the full room, I would have used it. 

This was my worst experience with Marriott and I will now consider moving my business travel to Hilton as many of the people that work for me have suggested.",1,2015,10,20
13,Perfect Extended Weekend Break in the Centre of Barcelona,"My wife and I stayed in Cotton House for the second time and it was just fantastic. We arrived Friday 16th at 11am and although check in time was not until 3, the staff pulled out all the stope to get the room ready for us at 11:30 which was a nice surprise. The hotel is a gem, absolutely stunning and the Ottoman room we stayed in was stunning, with many original features such as the beautiful ornate high ceilings maintained from the 1800s. The breakfast in Cotton House is delicious with a wonderful diverse selection of options that you would seldom find, everything top quality. The staff couldn't do enough for us and the Gossypium (Concierge) team goes above and beyond to make sure we got everything we wanted. Normal stuff like booking restaurants and attractions and spa massages to left field stuff like arranging mountain bike hire and guided route trails, which was new to them but they researched it and organised it perfectly for me and I had a great time biking up Mount Tibidabo and taking in the spectacular views of the city from up there! Anyway we can't recommend it highly enough, we've been there twice his year and will definitely be back at some stage as we both loved it.",5,2015,10,19
13,In the Heart of Barcelona ,"Fabulous best describes this intimate hotel right in the heart of the city within walking distance of everywhere in Barcelona. Rooms were private, comfortable, and had every amenity one could want. Bar, lounge and restaurant offered excellent service and the food was delicious. We would stay there again when we return to Barcelona. ",5,2015,10,18
13,Amazing Place!,"Outstanding Property! Really beautiful common areas and rich in history.  Good location; easy walk to Plaza de Cataluña, Barcelona Cathedral, and la Sagrada Familia.  Room was modern and comfortable; staff was extremely service oriented.",5,2015,10,18
13,charming hotel in great part of town,"The Cotton House is the renovated old Textile Exchange building in the heart of the city, but in quiet area.  you are only three or blocks from the heart of things so you quiet and access at the same time.  the lobby and lounges are beautiful with old fire places and great sense of the history of the building.  the rooms are very modern and comfortable, but not large.  the breakfast which was included is amazing, a true Spanish breakfast.  
the location was perfect you are within  10-15 minute walk to most parts of town, or a 5-7 euro cab ride.",4,2015,10,18
13,Fantastic Hotel,"The staff at Cotton H ouse was fantastic. Everyone including the front desk, concierge and bartenders could not have been more helpful or friendly. We were welcomed back every evening with a friendly hola and sent off everyone morning with a smiling  buenos dias. Cotton House is in a great location. Easy to walk (and we did) almost everywhere in Barcelona...especially our favorite area....the Gothic quarter. Our room was super quiet allowing us a good nights sleep and recovery from very active days. Definitely would recommend this hotel friends.",5,2015,10,18
13,Fantastic Hotel,"This place has so much history and charm and is really gorgeous.  And going off the name, of course the cotton sheets are SO comfortable.  I heard they are going to start selling them!  The breakfast spread is completely amazing.  Check out the pool area - it's so peaceful and has a great view of the city.  We absolutely loved our stay here!!",5,2015,10,17
13,Very lovely stay - an oasis of calm in a bustling city,"I stayed here for 3 days in October for business and usually find it difficult to sleep in hotel beds - not so here.  Huge, very deep, comfy bed with wonderful pillows. The only thing that interrupted my slumber was the very noisy mini bar fridge (room 204 if the hotel reads this as I forgot to mention it in checkout).  I'm sure a maintenance visit could easily sort it out. Lovely breakfast and good room service too.  Would very happily stay here again. ",5,2015,10,17
13,Found just what we wanted,"Spent 7 nights here in early October. Marriot did a great job of turning this building into a unique and elegant hotel. Our room was what they referred to as ""Madras"", I actually wanted the next level up but the hotel was booked months in advance.
The room was small (. By U.S.standards but bigger than most small European rooms, if you can follow my logic)but it was laid out so well that it felt bigger than it was. We were comfortable spending late afternoons in the room as we planned each day. Great overhead shower and well laid out bathroom area with the shower separated from the toilette area and then the sink area located by itself,made it easy for us to get up and get going without bumping into each other. Also the ceilings are high and a nice large window really makes the room comfortable

Windows , doors and walls are well built and high-end so it is very very quiet and we proved it by sleeping in each day until after 10 am and being surprised it was so late. We had a street view on the fourth floor and it was extremely quiet.

The entrance, lobby ,library area and all common areas have a elegance that makes this a great home base. The roof deck has a small pool and good views but you really need to be standing to see the views. No real area to sit and still see over the walls.On the second floor there is a nice outdoor dining, get a drink etc area that we used each evening to sit and talk about our day. Nicely laid out and very large so you could always find a private corner.
Breakfast was incredible, so much choice from pastries to cereal, to cheese breads ,meats and smoked salmon.
We did not use the restaurant other than to grab a quick bite on our first night as we checked in late. The food we had was very good and many people were dining each night
Staff was energetic and helpful , they appeared trained and eager to please. They were all young and full of energy. This is not a complaint just an observation that at times we felt like we were running through a gauntlet of can I help you, obviously much better than the opposite. 
The concierge position was held by a number of energetic young staff. They were helpful with restaurant reservations and directions.
We highly recommend this location for your stay in Barcelona",5,2015,10,15
13,Terrific Hotel!,"Great location, facilities, rooms and staff. Rooms are very comfortable, with plenty of amenities.   Got the other tech types, plenty of outlets, a great safe for laptops, cameras, tablets, etc. Good WiFi, and excellent food on the very nice terrace. The location is excellent, easy walking to most major attractions, and plenty of restaurants nearby. The staff is extremely helpful, patient and professional. Not cheap, but well worth it!",5,2015,10,14
13,Beat Marriott hotel out there,"WOW WOW WOW.

By far the most beautiful boutique hotel out there...Period.

This is a converted house of one of the most affluent families from the cotton trade over a century ago. The elegance and grace with which they have converted his hotel is awe inspiring. The theme that runs across the decoration is cotton like simplicity, with a generous use of white... The hotel is simply gorgeous to look at.

We had a king room with a balcony (called cotton room), and had one of the best nights' sleep ever in a hotel. The sheets are, without exaggeration, the softest and most inviting I Have ever slept in. And we're very picky about the quality of our sheets. But this was just next level stuff. Let me repeat myself - THESE ARE NO ORDINARY BEDSHEETS. They are velvety, silky, cloudy soft cotton sheets that will make anybody melt into them.

The hotel restaurant Batuar is incredible. We NEVER eat at hotel restaurants because there is so much better food out there in these lush global cities, but Batuar was as good as anything we had on this 3 week European trip. Great breakfast and lunch at the Mediterranean Spanish fusion restaurant. Also a terrific place for drinks in the expansive outdoor dining area.

The staff is possibly the best part of the hotel. Each and every person is young, energetic, enthusiastic, highly educated and highly intelligent. They exude an immense sense of pride in their hotel and city, and we often found ourselves in wonderful conversation with them. Whether it was the front desk, the bell desk, or the concierge, they were all full of grace and generous courtesy.

This is absolutely our #1 choice of hotel in Barcelona for the future, with its perfect location, beauty, service, and charm. Quite possibly our favorite Marriott property along the JW Ko Olina in Hawaii.

We spent ~$400/night for our room.",5,2015,10,14
13,Barcelona rocks,"Absolutely fabulous hotel!  Highly recommend to all, large rooms, comfy beds, great outdoor eating & drinking spot.  Within walking distance to everything, transportation nearby as well. Safe & very friendly personnel.  Loved it.",5,2015,10,13
13,The perfect beginning of our 24-day mediterranean vacation!,"What a enchanting hotel; Marriott owned guarantees the quality to be top notched.  The staff throughout was delightful and personable.  The food & drinks were excellent, the rooms, though typically european small, were fresh and clean AND quiet.  The bed was very comfortable.  The history of the building alone will keep you interested for hours before leaving to explore this beautiful city.  We can't wait to return!!",5,2015,10,13
13,Top notch hotel and incredible staff!,"Boutique feel hotel with family ties to international brand (Marriott).  Quick and to the point... Great hotel! Ambiance, staff, rooms and equally important the food is all 5 star's in my book. The only improvement that I'd request would be better choices in pillows but that is the only thing out of potentially many many thing's that could use improvement. (Thus my 4 out of the 5 star's rating). We will stay here again the next time we're in Barcelona. Love this hotel!",4,2015,10,12
13,Elegant Property,The Cotton House was the first stop for my husband and I on our two week vacation in Europe.  It was an especially elegant property with very good service.  The Bar was lovely retreat for us late in the evening and had a vast assortment of rum and a very knowledgeable bartender.  The breakfast display was beautiful as well as delicious.  An overall romantic setting.  Rooms in the back are extremely quiet and perfect for jet lag recovery.  This was the 2nd Autograph property we've stayed at (Algonquin in NYC the first).  We loved Barcelona and would definitely return to the Cotton House.,5,2015,10,11
13,Boutique Beauty!,"beautiful, boutique hotel! We loved the esthetic feel. The suite was large, very comfortable, with simple and stylish furnishings.  Location worked very well for us to walk to most of the neighborhoods we were interested in.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Delicious breakfast every day in a beautiful dining area/terrace.",4,2015,10,10
13,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic Stay","My wife and I recently finished up a weekend stay at the Cotton House Hotel and cannot say enough positive things about our experience. We had a great weekend stay at the hotel.

The Cotton House is a smaller boutique hotel with 83 rooms in what was once the Association of Cotton House Manufacturers building. The hotel is loaded with historic character, especially the first floor public spaces, which were gorgeous.

We arrived around 11am on a Saturday morning, and were warmly welcomed by Caroline at the front desk. Due to our early arrival, our room was not ready yet.  We were offered a chance to shower and change if we wanted to freshen up a bit. They put our bags in storage and we headed out for the day. 

We arrived back at the hotel around 3pm, where Caroline welcomed us again and then we were escorted to our room. The room was beautiful with a primarily white color scheme, dark wood floors, king size bed, and a nice balcony. The bathroom had a unique layout and was actually 2 separate rooms. One room had the toilet, the other room was a shower room with a rain shower and a tub to the right.

We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and a very large “Happy Anniversary” was written on the mirror in the hallway, and “You look fabulous!” on the mirror over the sink. We also had a silver tray with sweets waiting for us to help celebrate. Both were a fun and nice touch by the hotel staff.

The bed was extremely comfortable, with high quality sheets. The bathroom also was equipped with great towels and nice bath amenities. Everything in the room was top notch and comfortable. 

We really enjoyed our balcony, and used it after spending a day sightseeing to relax and enjoy a glass of wine or sangria before heading out to dinner.

After having dinner, we would return to the hotel and spend the evening outside on the back terrace enjoying sangria and the romantic candle lights and fires that were lit. The terrace was quiet, and was a romantic place to enjoy the cooler fall evenings in Barcelona. 

The breakfast buffet in the morning was outstanding. The options were tremendous with fruit, meats, cheeses, cereals, breads, quiche, and sweets being available to enjoy. Hot items were also available if desired. 

The staff at the hotel were outstanding. Everyone from Caroline at the front desk, to the bell hops, and staff in the restaurant, were friendly, professional, and very polite. The service they provided was top notch.   

The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to the Born area, and about a 15 minute walk to Sagrada Familia, so the location is convenient to many of the Barcelona attractions.  

If you are looking for a top notch boutique hotel experience, the Cotton House Hotel is a great place to stay. The hotel is absolutely fantastic.",5,2015,10,08
13,Beautiful boutique hotel,"We spent three lovely nights at the Cotton House Hotel and I can't imagine a nicer place to stay in Barcelona. From the moment we checked in until we left, the staff was friendly, helpful and professional. Our room was beautiful and comfortable. We ate dinner one night and lunch one day in the hotel restaurant, Batuar, and it was very nice.
The location was easy for walking to most sites and many local restaurants.",5,2015,10,08
13,All around wonderful,"We stayed at the cotton house hotel for our anniversary and were blown away by the charm, class, and uniqueness of this hotel. The staff were warm and accommodating, the room was minimalistic yet all you could want and need, the rooftop was perfect, and the continental breakfast/bar was out of this world. Love Barcelona and love his hotel. We will definitely be back! ",5,2015,10,08
13,You Won't Be Disappointed,"The hotel is beautiful, small and comfortable with an exceptionally friendly and helpful staff and a great location.  The common areas are beautifully appointed.  The guest rooms are very nice.  The hotel is quiet, and the staff could not be more friendly or helpful.  It is a short walk from prime sightseeing and shopping.  The concierge can assist with tours and dinner reservations, train tickets to nearby cities, etc.",5,2015,10,07
13,"Perfect Location, Great Staff!","We stayed a total of four nights at the Cotton House Hotel.  The first night was at the beginning of our trip when we first arrived in Barcelona before we got on our cruise ship and the next three nights was the following week after our cruise ended.  When we returned to the hotel for the second part of our stay the Gossypium team left us a nice note in our room and some chocolates welcoming us back to the hotel. A true five star hotel touch!

The Cotton House Hotel is situated in the Eixample district of Barcelona.  It is a part of the Marriott's Autograph Collection.  It is a boutique hotel with a perfect location.  A close proximity to all the great sites and a great location for the best restaurants.

We stayed in a Madras room and it was perfect.  The room has a rain shower, is very clean, comfortable and quiet. The staff at the hotel speak good English and are all very kind and helpful. The concierge recommended great places to eat and we were well taken care of during our stay.

Thank you Cotton House Hotel for making our stay an awesome one.  We will definitely be back!",4,2015,10,06
13,One of the Most Amazing Hotels I have ever been to!,"Wow! From the moment I walked in the door until the time I checked out I was treated like royalty by the General Manager Andrew Canals and Ruben Fernandez Vargas (who I plan to write about when I write my customer service book)! The room was immaculate, the service exceptional, and the hotel is packed with history and a very strong ""cool"" factor. This is now my home away from home in Barcelona!",5,2015,10,06
13,The way 5 star hotels should be,"What an exceptional property. Our group of 8 couples chose this hotel for our final 2 night stay in Barcelona after a 2 week cruise from Istanbul.  We could not have enjoyed our stay more.  The property is beautiful, warm and very inviting with great attention to every detail.  The staff is outstanding in every respect.  This is a new hotel but exemplifies old world European charm and hospitality.",5,2015,10,06
13,Exceptional hospitality in fabulous surroundings,"I chose the Cotton House because I had seen pictures of the interior design in House and Garden Magazine. I went with a friend who needed cheering up and this was just the place for us. The interior design was spectacular but what impressed us even more was the exceptional customer service. The young, professional staff were so helpful and kind and friendly and always efficient. 

The hotel is well placed to explore the sites of Barcelona - many within walking distance of the hotel. It was always a pleasure to return to the hotel to relax or enjoy drinks on the attractive garden terrace - The staff greeted us like old friends and it just felt like coming home!   

The breakfast is quite wonderful and the many treats put us in good spirits each morning. Our room was spotlessly clean and the beds were very comfortable. We recommend choosing a room like ours with a balcony overlooking the garden terrace.

Thank you to all at The Cotton House who made our stay so perfect.",5,2015,10,06
13,good,if you want to spend couple of night in barcelona this is ok. the service should be better but the decor and athmospere its good. if back i will try something different mainly because of the poor of service. overall its OK,4,2015,10,06
13,What a gem!,"This place is a true little gem. It's wonderfully stylish, the whole place has such a nice cotton smell (you smell it when you walk past it!) snd staff treats you like royalty. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I've ever seen, and you can enjoy breakfast on a nice terrace. What's more, there's even a rooftop pool with a nice view over Barcelona! Would recommend this place to anyone. ",5,2015,10,05
13,Wonderful Stay!,"We had a great two night stay at this property in September 2015. We stayed in one of the larger guest rooms-the Egyptian room-and found it very comfortable and nicely appointed. I will say that the bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever stayed in, so we felt very well rested after a long flight over to Spain from the U.S. We found the staff very helpful and friendly and enjoyed having breakfast every morning out on the back patio. The interior of the hotel is beautiful and very elegant. This property is also very centrally located so you can walk to a good number of the major sites in downtown Barcelona. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to Barcelona.",5,2015,10,02
13,End of Summer Evening!,"Fun drinks on the Terrace and a lovely dinner.

The Hotel is stunning and worth a visit in itself. Drinks were on the terrace, the staff were obliging and brought our first course outside. This consisted of foie gras lolly pops, shrimp, croquettes, all delicious (especially pheasant and truffle). 

Announcing our main courses when they were ready. (I enjoyed the lamb very much).

On the whole lovely evening, good company, staff obliging and caring if not always co-ordinated at times.

Recommend.",4,2015,09,29
13,"Location, charm and service","Such a great location. Only took a taxi once to the Park Guell, walked back. Near the Gothic centre and great museums.  Great bar and bartender. The staff is very helpful and welcoming. They new it was my birthday and decorated our room and had a lovely dessert and wine waiting for us.  Be sure to go up to the roof top pool, has a good view of the Sagrada Familia. The bathroom is wonderful and the whole cotton theme is great, best towels and sheets-ever! Beautiful historic hotel would never think it's a Marriott!",5,2015,09,27
13,豬在棉花裡,"After two days in Bacelona, I finally went to visit The Cotton House Hotel where my sister is interning. The second I walked in I WAS COMPLETELY UTTERLY AMAZED AND OVERWHELMED. It felt fake. The interior design completely threw me off! It's A perfect fusion of modern contemporary and 17 century architecture with a hint of european royalty vibe. The wooden spiral stair case hiding at the very back of the hotel is my favorite. Best way to view this stair case is to walk all the way to the 6th floor and look down- absolutely amazing with the lights hanging down from the ceiling! The library and terrace are so relaxing, best places to sit and read a book or get some work done!
The service is also what made me love the hotel so much. The hotel is basically run by young professionals- humorous and fun yet enthusiastic and down to help you with literally anything and everything. Especially the concierge team known as Gossypium Carolina, Clara, Richard, Damian, Olga and the best golden keys Alfredo. They know Barcelona from the inside and out- from touristy areas to extremely local places to where to party at night. You can always ask any of them and they give you all the information!! Also the Reception gives you one of the best first impression of the hotel providing little desserts and drinks to welcome you. The restaurant bar Batuar provides a beautiful oasis feel with plants and cute lights hanging off the Celine. The terrace is the perfect escape from this busy Barcelona city center. The service is great, people are all very welcoming and gives you a very cosy feeling, Nuri and Gigi are great!!!I had the customize cocktails in the bar and they are definitely unique, created by two of the best bartenders in Europe Jonathan and Hiomar. The things that attracted me about their food is the beautiful design and delicious fusion (prawns with chocolate sauce, Foie Bon Bon are amazing). Anyways, Cotton House is really something amazingly different!",5,2015,09,27
13,Fabulous Charming Luxurious Hotel,"Fabulous Historical Charming Hotel, great location close to most attractions. Attentive & friendly staff. Comfortable bed with exquisite linen, attractive rooms. Roof top pool & lounging area a bonus on a hot day!",5,2015,09,27
13,"Beautiful hotel, but lacking high-end boutique feel","We stayed at the Cotton House for a night and it was pleasurable, though nothing exciting especially given the price. The rooms were quite small and we found the food to be quite poor. Difficult to get service on the roof when relaxing as well.

A bit of a disappointment as we've stayed in dozens of boutique hotels and were a bit weary that this was run by Marriott. Example: only 3 wifi codes per room. How come? We have 2 iphones, 2 ipads, 2 work computers. One of us couldn't use a work computer during our stay if we had to!  Most quality boutiques in Europe don't charge for mini-bar waters, juices, etc. but the Cotton House did. Little things like that which make you question how authentic the hotel is. 

Service was nice and fairly attentive and the hotel was beautifully decorated, almost a Cuban theme to it. A nice stay, but pricey given the offerings and other Boutique choices around Barcelona.",3,2015,09,27
13,Beautifully renovated historical building,"Our stay at Cotton House Hotel a Marriott Property, unknown to most. It may only be a managed property, there are no Marriott emblems or uniforms to be seen. We used Marriott points for our stay.
The staff was very welcoming and approachable for any help you may need. 
We enjoyed the breakfast, buffet style with all the usual assorted local Salumi, cheeses, fresh veggies, smoked salmon, cold cuts, breads,fresh juices, and more. A table of delectable looking assorted sweets available as well. There were also a few selected menu order items, eggs, pancakes, etc. for 5€ extra.

The Cotton House building has some amazing history behind it's years. There are several photos and articles you may read about it. 
The variety of bolts of fine cotton fabrics are to been seen in several places within the hotel. Spend a few moments getting close to them to see the detail work. 
The dining room has some beautify displayed dish ware from the old days. In addition to the wood work and light fixtures from days gone by.
Our room 410, had a window but didn't look out at anything. It was very comfortable.
The beds & pillows  are made for a good nights rest! So Comfortable and cozy. 
The bathroom was small and sufficient, with a nice size shower and an awesome rain head down pouring of water.
We personally didn't care for the smell of the soap & lotion products. 
Plush towels and plenty of them. 
There is a safe in the closet and it worked easily. 
There are a lot Americans staying here, it was very user friendly and English is spoken by all staff.

13,"Beautiful Hotel, small room with some issues","We stayed 2 nights at this lovely hotel. The staff from front desk to bartender are very accommodating.  The public areas are wonderfully decorated with lots of character and charm.  

We received a lovely treat of an upgrade to an Egyptian room and a second treat of a nice note on our mirror acknowledging our anniversary.  The room was fairly small (so I can't imagine how tiny the 3 less expensive room categories are); however, the decor is clean and modern and the closet and bathroom spacious. The rain shower was particularly nice.

 However, our room had an odd sulfer gas/sewage smell about 4 or 5 times a day for 10 minutes or so.  Really strange.  It did wake us a few times a night and took time to dissipate.  Not sure if it is the hotels fault, but we likely wouldn't stay again due to this issue. Otherwise, it is a great property.",4,2015,09,26
13,One night business stay,I stayed here for work and I wish I could have stayed longer. The hotel is gorgeous and the service matches the hotel for quality. I had missed breakfast by 20 mins but the staff were more than happy to accommodate me. A special mention to Paula and the very helpful Swiss girl on reception.,5,2015,09,26
13,"Historical, classy, exquisite hotel","I cannot say enough good about this hotel.  Get a room with a balcony overlooking the terrace!  Furnishing are beautiful and tell a story of the heritage of the building.  Just far enough away from las ramblas but just close enough!  Visit the library, rooftop pool and dine at the delicious in house restaurant and them return to a room fit for a queen.  Service was amazing!",5,2015,09,24
13,Vacation stop after cruise,The hotel location was great.  Right on the edge of the gothic area.  Easy walk to all the sites.  The peope were very friendly and helpful.  The building was awsome.  Was a cotton headquarter with many cool items from that still there.  Went up to pool on roof for some sun.  The cahirs up there could be beds.  Had drinks and snacks in bar. A little pricey but very good with very friendly help.  Did the breakfast buffet in the morning and there was a hugh variety of food and everything we had was good.  You will not be disappointed in this stay.,5,2015,09,23
13,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,"I stayed at the Cotton House 2 weeks ago, it was an amazing hotel i got to experience for the first time Barcelona, and i truly believe i made the right decision on staying at the cotton house, staff was amazing truly kind and always there for me. i would like to especially thank Clara from concierge, i was looking for some good places to visit and she just told me the right place to visit, as well she told me really good places to eat. thank you cotton house for making my stay exceptional truly recommend this hotel for anybody who is looking for a great Barcelona experience",5,2015,09,23
13,Highly Recomment Cotton House Hotel,"I would highly recommend The Cotton House Hotel.  Staff is very professional and helpful - starting with the doorman to the front dest, concierge.wait staff in bar and restaurant, etc.  The decor is lovely and the rooms far exceeded our expectations.  We actually moved from The W Hotel to stay at The Cotton House.  A beautiful botique hotel!!!",5,2015,09,23
13,Beautiful hotel located close to the main shopping boulevards,"I found my stay at The Cotton House to be excellent although some quirky designs to the rooms did cause for some inconvenience. Check-in was both quick and without incident and the staff were always friendly throughout my stay. The hotel is located in an old cotton trading building and the hotel décor was one of the most intriguing and beautifully designed hotels I have ever stayed at. The hotel grounds are not huge but they somehow managed to fit in a patio for alfresco dining as well as a pool. The rooms are beautifully appointed and being in an old cotton house they made sure all their linen was top notch. There are also a complete set of in-room amenities for the guests.

We stayed in the Madras room and I am not sure if all rooms are designed the same but the design was a bit quirky as the toilet, shower, and sink basin are all located in different parts of the room. It means that sitting on the toilet can get a bit claustrophobic sometimes and taking a shower means walking wet across the living room to the sink basin area to dry off which leaves wet puddles in the living area. Taking a towel into the shower room is not feasible because the towel just gets wet as you take a shower. Other than the unorthodox layout the rooms were fabulous.

Breakfast was excellent and recommended with a great selection including iberico ham, salad greens, and fresh fruit. Also the staff will cook up any hot food such as pancakes to order.

WiFi is free throughout the hotel and was reliable and fast. There were enough outlets to charge two iphones and two ipads at the same time.

If it weren’t for the quirky layout the Hotel would be in my top hotels I have ever stayed at. I still give it 5 stars however because the décor and everything else about the hotel apart from the weird room layout is excellent.

The hotel is not easy to find because there are no prominent signs outside the hotel except for some flags that show the name of the hotel. Taxis also have difficulty knowing where the hotel is because it is a new hotel. The easiest way to get there is to take the train to Catalunya and after exiting head for the road called Passeig De Garcia next to the Apple Shop. Keep an eye out for the Zara store on the right side of Passeig De Garcia and then take a right down that road for about 400m until you reach Palace hotel. The Cotton House is directly adjacent to that hotel. There is a closer metro station called Passeig De Garcia but I found my bearings were better when using the Catalunya station.",5,2015,09,22
13,"Amazing hotel, Excellent staff and great location!!","This is a true jewel in the heart of Barcelona! Historical building refurbished with passion and tastefulness conveniently located near to all main attractions. The rooms are wonderfully decorated with the most comfortable bedding (real egyptian cotton!). The restaurant Batuar is just perfect! from the decor to the excellent quality of food. But even better is the team! Very attentive and professional with a charming and genuine smile, always ready to assist in anything we might needed. A big thank you to all, from the Front Desk to Gossypium (Concierge team) including the Housekeeping and Restaurant staff members. We will for sure return back and we are already recommending this property to all our friends and relatives!",5,2015,09,22
13,Great personal service - they make you feel really appreciated,"The service here is absolutely brilliant - from the moment you arrive to the day you leave - attentive, good humoured and not in the least patronising - great concierge service , lovely bar and reading rooms - Decor very art deco -every time we got out of the lift  we felt we were in a Fred Astaire movie.
However - our room which was described as the largest - was to be honest a bit on the small side and the view from our balcony was unfortunately of a building site - which on a week day could be really noisy .Try asking for a street view  room -unless you like watching cranes!
Fortunately we were to busy enjoying Barcelona and the very good weather to worry to much 
But surprisingly for Marriott, and we have stayed in many, the gym was tiny and the pool area very limited  and there was no mirror in the room for my wife to do her make up - and no real dressing table-
However these are quibbles and the warmth of our reception very time we returned from an excursion made us feel really welcomed.
Recommended, as long as you don't plan staying in the room -but then why would you -with so much to see , do and eat.",4,2015,09,21
13,One of the most enchanting stay,Amazing old palace with great and very welcomed staff. You would be treated as prince/princess during your stay at Cotton House Hotel. More over you will feel you are in this beautiful furnished hotel with excellent management.,5,2015,09,21
13,#stayhere,"Was so sad to leave the beautiful Cotton House Hotel this morning...and can I tell you that I have never, ever reviewed anything in my entire life, but I imagine that you like I are reading these reviews trying to find the perfect place to stay in beautiful Barcelona....if this is on your list you must move it to the very top.  I have been lucky enough to stay in four Autograph Collection Hotels in the last few years....the Grand Bohemian in Asheville, NC, the Kahema Grand Zurich in Switzerland, the London EDITION and just now the Cotton House Hotel.....if it is said that the London EDITION oozes cool then it must now be said that the Cotton House Hotel oozes Barcelona....it is charming and elegant and oh so Catalan without being one bit pretentious....no detail has been spared in the thoughtfulness of this hotel.  The location is perfection...you can walk or taxi to everywhere you need ,,,,Park Güell and Sagrada Familia were our favorites....book your tickets ahead online to avoid the long waiting times.... My husband says that a hotel is a hotel but it is the people who make it special.  That being said, the team at the Cotton House Hotel is very special indeed....you are greeted with the most genuine smiles you have ever seen...they are eager & earnest to share their beautiful hotel & city with you.....the Gossypium arranged two lovely dinners for us truly at the last minute and we had evenings we will never forget.  The bar at the hotel is so pretty...try the local Epidor Beer & the Petra Cocktail.... Finally there is the breakfast....amazing....and there is chocolate cake....yes...chocolate cake at breakfast ,,,, you know what they say....life is short....eat dessert early....oh and stay at the Cotton House Hotel...you will not regret it...xoxo",5,2015,09,20
13,Charming boutique hotel - under the Marriott umbrella,"Stayed here twice, one night each, the night before and the night after a cruise. On each occasion, hotel staff was excellent. Upon arrival after a delayed flight from London, the receptionist not only showed us to our room, but she also provided a tour of what was once the office's for a cotton producer. The hotel is marvelous, maintaining an old style charm to the decor.

Being platinum with Marriott, we were upgraded each time, and the rooms were outstanding. Wifi works very well, too.

That said, I'd make a few suggestions. First, the American style outlets didn't seem to work, though the Spanish ones were fine with a working converter. Second, there is no instruction to inform guests that dialing a ""9"" on the phone reaches the front desk. A little note by the phone would be very helpful. Finally, although the air conditioning works wonderfully, it would save time if there were instructions for it's use. On my first visit, it took about 15 minutes to figure it out and to know that it was working, in spite of how wonderfully quiet it is.",5,2015,09,20
13,"A Unique, Special Hotel","Stayed 2 nights while sightseeing Barcelona. Hotel is conveniently located in an upscale area close to Plaza Catalonia, La Rambla, and the old city.  The hotel looks very new and fresh (which it is). The ground floor and the next floor (1st floor) retain the architecture of the original building - quite beautifully appointed. The restaurant on the 1st floor consists of beautifully appointed rooms including glas front cabinets with fabric samples galore. The breakfast spread offered many selections and all were enjoyed immensely. There was also a nicely landscaped terrace off the restaurant  that was the best place to enjoy breakfast, lunch or a drink. Also on the first floor are comfortable sitting areas and the very helpful concierge staff. The hotel staff was always accessible and quite helpful. The rooms, also very nicely appointed, with separate enclosures for shower and tub, and for the toilet. The rooms are a bit small (which is typical of big city hotels) but very comfortable.
All In all, this is a hotel that I would love to come back to.",5,2015,09,20
13,Beyond Fabulous!,"What a marvelous jewel. The decor is so lovely and welcoming. It feels like you have arrived home to your beautiful and sophisticated home. The staff is charming, each and everyone of them.  They can't do enough for you and each is filled with intelligence and the right amount of friendliness. Breakfast buffet is a work of art. We have had two dinners in the beautiful,terrace area of restaurant. Honestly, so e of the best dining ever! The rooms, while somewhat small are lovely with beds and sheets that are the best I have ever experienced! The Cotton House is a vacation on its own, yet located in beautiful Barcelona with all it has to offer.",5,2015,09,20
13,Small expensive but charming,Room was extremely small with no view.  The window looked into a concrete wall.  Bathroom was nice and staff was friendly. Pool was nice but no enough chairs.   We were told we booked a deluxe room but this room was anything but deluxe.  Bed was not very comfy and linens were cheap.  Shower was amazing.  Hotel was great walking distance to many great sights. Will book the Hilton on our next trip.,3,2015,09,20
13,Disappoiting,"I expect a 5 Star hotel to help clients in distress.  We had a problem with one of our luggage and could not dispatch with the airline.  The minimum behaviour I would expect from a good hotel is for them to receive my luggage and send me an email asking what to do, considering I had just left the hotel an hour ago. When I called to let them know it was coming, they said they received it but could not hold for long.  I had a friend go to the hotel the next day to pick it up, the hotel said they didn't have it.  When I called to ask where it was, they said they never received it and didn't even care to register the contact information of the person who tried to deliver it.  So, I lost my luggage.  All they can say is that they are sorry and keep repeating the hotel policy line.  It is a shame, because although the hotel is very pretty, it is not their ""policy"" to help you if you have any problem.",1,2015,09,19
13,"Great hotel, staff and location ","We had a great stay at the a Cottonhouse Hotel. The room was on the smaller side, but well appointed. We had a room with a balcony, which was great for a morning coffee. The rain shower was nice and the large soaking tub was inviting after a long night of exploring. Barcelona can get quite hot, so we really enjoyed the rooftop pool. Great way to grab a beer and cool off mid afternoon. The staff were wonderful. Great English and always willing to help us figure out where we were going. Highly recommended the hotel for anyone staying in Barcelona.

13,Awesome Hotel with Great Service,I truly had a wonderful time celebrating my 50th birthday at the Cotton House! The staff was superb! The service and attention to detail was fantastic. They made my trip memorable. Great location... Great Staff!!! Thank you!,5,2015,09,18
13,Outstanding service,"It was by far one of the best service I have seen. The staff a very friendly, the rooms are comfortable and their buffet is beautifully presented, not to mention the highest quality and taste of food offered. As well as the team on the floor they all show utmost professionalism & organization, i would like to thank you infinitely for making my trip to Barcelona so comfortable and welcoming. Your commitment, hard work and professionalism simply puts you on a different level.",5,2015,09,18
13,Flawless,"A fabulous hotel - all the staff were were pleasant, helpful and friendly; the public areas and rooms are beautiful and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  The first night, I thought I'd have to complain that the air con wasn't working, but then I discovered that it was, it was just so quiet that I couldn't hear it - a totally new experience for me!  Definitely one I would visit again.",5,2015,09,18
13,One of a kind must visit hotel!,"This is an absolutely beautiful and unique hotel and will add such memories to your Barcelona trip! My friend and I arrived to this lovely property and enjoyed every inch of this breathtaking property from having drinks on the terrace, relaxing at the pool while relishing the amazing view of the city, and having a glass of wine in the library. The attention that the staff gives is unsurpassed from any hotel we have ever stayed in. They are so delightful and helpful. The rooms are so quiet, elegant, and beds are most comfortable you will find. Also, don't miss the breakfast in the morning! You need a full day added to your vacation to just enjoy this gem! We can't wait to return! Thank you Cotton House!",5,2015,09,17
13,Beautiful hotel; extraordinary staff; great rooms,"As a Marriott Gold member, we often look for interesting ""boutique"" hotels in the Autograph Collection.  Cotton House is a new addition to the Autograph Collection and I predict it will soon be a premier destination.  My girl friend and I stayed here for three nights at the end of a hectic sightseeing Mediterranean cruise.  

The entire hotel has been designed around the building's historic past as the private club of the region's cotton manufacturers.  The attention to detail is extraordinary - the public rooms are museum quality.  The upper floors are modern, high ceiling hotel rooms.  A perfect blend; matching the historic and modern mix of Barcelona itself.

The staff is relatively young, energetic and clearly excited to be part of the adventure of a new luxury hotel.  Check in was effortless.  We had selected an Egyptian room (as in Egyptian cotton, not decor).  Not huge, but big by European standards.  Modern decor, large bathroom, large closet, high ceilings.

The breakfast buffet was expansive and included everything from cereal to continental breakfast cold meats to dessert!  In typical Spanish fashion, it served until 11 am, to accommodate the late night revelers.  Even though the buffet comes with Gold membership, we purchased the room package with breakfast so that we could also have hot American style breakfast options.  In hindsight this was not necessary as the buffet was more than enough.

The concierge was prominently located in a main public area and quite helpful with dinner reservations and sightseeing options.  The Hotel is located a couple of blocks from the fashion district and shopping areas and about four blocks from the top of Las Ramblas.  And, as everywhere in Barcelona, near the easy to use subway.  The staff will run down to the corner of the avenue and fetch taxis for you.  (As I said... Young and energetic!) 

We loved this hotel; were blown away by the architecture and public areas; and impressed by the attentive staff.  We will stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2015,09,16
13,"Beautiful Marriott property, friendly staff","Our stay at the Cotton House was fantastic! We arrived around 8am fresh from our flight from the US. Our room was not ready but we were offered cookies, water, and most importantly, a place to shower, change & rest (roof top pool deck - great view of the city & Sagrada Familia). This was an amazing perk!

We were emailed when our room was ready, which was slightly early than we anticipated but a welcome email to grab a nap! The shower and bath room in our room was amazing; it had a waterfall shower head and a deep bath tub. Very relaxing. Be aware that the hotel circulates its signature scent throughout the lobby and rooms. It didn't bother me but if you are sensitive to smells, just an FYI. 

As a Platinum member, we received free breakfast, which had a nice offering to start your day. You can enjoy this on the beautiful deck area or in the restaurant. 

The hotel is relatively new, and as such has a few kinks to work out. Our bath faucet fell off and water sprayed everywhere, and there was a smoky smell in our entry way...it’s a smoke free hotel. However, the entire staff was always ready to help with whatever we needed. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to friends!",5,2015,09,15
13,"Beautiful hotel, Great Are","We stayed at the Cotton House over the weekend before heading out for a Mediterranean cruise. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on and the shower was devine. The hotel is both beautiful and well maintained & the staff is eager to please. We especially enjoyed Reuben at the front desk & Jonathan at the bar, plus Carlos is the restaurant at breakfast who made sure we had everything we needed even tho we showed up late for breakfast. The only reason I did not give it an excellent rating was the fact that while our room had a window it looked out at a wall. As Platinum Elite members, we chose to use points for our stay and were given what was arguably the worst room in the hotel in terms of a view. Since we spent most time touring, and the rest of the room attributes were nice, it did not hinder our vacation but at 40,000 points per night & being loyal Marriott customers I'd like to think we should have been given a better situated room. We will take that up with Marriott when we return to the states. ",4,2015,09,15
13,Romantic getaway,"We stayed at his wonderful hotel for one night only, celebrating our one year anniversary. The hotel itself is beautiful, staff is very helpful. I would like to mention positevly Daria from reception, she gave us a tour around the property and showed all facilities. We spent a day in pool with a marvelous view over the city and finished the evening with fabulous dinner in the hotel's restaurant.  The room was comfortable with all mordern conveniences. We even had a nice spacious balcony. the location is perfect, you can easily get to Sagrada Familia, there are a lot of restaurants and bars nearby, as well as farmacy and supermarket. I think we will come back to Cotton house next year and make it our new tradition.",5,2015,09,15
13,Wonderful and unique hotel,"We spend 4 nights at this beautiful hotel, and we highly recommend it!
The atmosphere is so relaxed, luxurious and friendly that you don't want to leave at all, but just stay there and escape reality. 
The staff is friendly and attentive, the rooms are lovely and crisp and breakfast is amazing - healthy with lots of options, and the room itself is stunning.
Not a great place for kids, but perfect for just about everyone else.
We have surely found our secret getaway here!",5,2015,09,14
13,Amazing staff and beautiful hotel ,"My wife and I stayed at the Cotton House for three nights while in Barcelona. First off, every staff person we encountered was fantastic. Extremely professional and accommodating. Also, the building is gorgeous with a very convenient central city location. Outstanding stay. The only thing to be aware of is, the rooms are on the small side but if you're only there to sleep, it doesn't matter. 
",5,2015,09,14
13,home sweet home,hotel centrally located in the heart of the city; clean and comfortable with a friendly and helpful staff.  the restaurant nicely appointed (both inside and outside).  lovely to feel like you are home while on vacation.,5,2015,09,14
13,Very nice place,I stayed in this lovely hotel for six nights . The place is really good and clean . All the workers there were very pleasant to deal with and ready to help any time with a very lovely smile in their faces . Location is very good and it is a walking distance from the centre of events . Would like always to come back and stay in this hotel . ,5,2015,09,13
13,A wonderfully unique property,"We stayed 5 nights in the Cotton House hotel and want to let everyone know it's fantastic!  

First, the Bartender Jonaton is one of the best in the World.  Wonderfully made Cotton Fashioned (Old Fashioned with a twist) is his specialty.  Servers who we enjoyed made us feel welcome - Gi Gi, Noodi, and Alex.  The Concierge staff found tickets for us, looked up a Motorcycle outlet store for us, and really helped us get the information we needed.
Lastly, the property is beautiful.  Each room is lovely but it's the library, the outdoor terrace, the rooftop pool, and all the touches of Cotton that make this a great stay.  I would not hesitate to return soon.
Great Job on this AC property from a Platinum Rewards Member!",5,2015,09,11
13,Wonderful hotel in a superb location,"We had a great stay at the Cotton House in August. All the members of staff we encountered were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times. 

Carolina at the front desk and the door crew were particularly responsive in assisting us with our check-in, handling our bags and transportation. Staff in the restaurant and Gossypium were interested in making sure that we were doing well during our stay. On arrival after a long flight the restaurant staff made sure we had tea and pastries before the breakfast service was cleared.

The staff team is an outstanding asset - really a differentiating feature for the Cotton House. Possibly a number are having hands-on experience before resuming study of hospitality management or are just at the end of their studies.  I do hope that the hotel managers continue to support the development of the staff and their enthusiasm continues to shine. It can be a little quirky in there at times but in a very good way!

The building is beautiful with many unique features after a sympathetic renovation of the original structure. Consequently there a number of different room floor plans and some are much smaller than others.  We were very happy with our Egyptian Cotton room with courtyard view. Very comfortable bed, plenty of space and it was peaceful.

We enjoyed staying in a smaller historic hotel and it does feature a small lap pool and roof terrace with a view over the city. Probably needs some shade up there but I guess that as the hotel is new it will develop services and modify some areas over time.

All of the places we wished to visit were within walking distance or a short taxi trip. The location is quiet but close to some very busy streets and sites. A couple of small grocery stores are a few minutes walk away and there are numerous small restaurants and cafes in the vicinity.

We would thoroughly recommend the Cotton House and hope to return and experience it again.",5,2015,09,11
13,Gem in the middle of Barcelona.,"We had a 3 night stay in Barcelona. From the time we arrived at the Cotton House we were welcomed and pampered. It was so nice to arrive after a long flight and given a refreshing glass of a local fruit juice. The rooms were clean and comfortable.  They thought of everything: a plug for US current, box with extra toothbrush, emoryboard, shoes shine cloth.  Next we used the concierge several times. All were extremely helpful.  We bought tickets for the La Sagrada Familia and the, 
Hop on Hop off bus. The concierge also made dinner suggestions and reservations for several evenings. Lastly, we were having trouble checking in for our flight to Istanbul. The concierge went out of her way to help us get through to the reservations number and then asked again later on whether everything was in order.  We were always greeted with a smile and a willingness to help in any way.
The location is great.  It is an easy walk to Las Ramblas and the market. Also there are tons of restaurants that are within a 5-10 minute walk.
I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2015,09,10
13,Interesting hotel ,"The cotton house is a very interesting hotel. It's a small hotel with a very specific theme. We found the hotel to be very nice and in a great location. Just off the main tourist areas. The staff was very friendly, however bar service was insanely slow in the evening, we had an empty drink for 45 min while the server walked by many times. We were one of four tables of people in the whole bar at the time. The hotel is very nice, in a nice area. However there really needs to be some training in regards to the bar. ",4,2015,09,09
13,Staff and building redeem this otherwise disappointing hotel,"In many ways the restoration of this beautiful building has succeeded in producing a beautiful hotel, but having made extensive renovations to our own home, we are perhaps sensitive to spotting short cuts and things that are sub-standard. The majority were cosmetic and small issues, but some were more substantial- the air conditioning unit falling out of the wall and crashing to the floor less than half a meter for the bed was not the most relaxing way to be woken from an afternoon nap (although the small grace is that we weren't standing underneath it- it took a large chunk out of the floor, so who knows how someone's skull would have faired). 
Breakfast is, quite frankly, bizarre. There is no hot food included- that is an extra 5 EUR per item. This annoys me, but is not a deal breaker. What I found more strange was the enormous range of cakes on offer. Surely eggs would be a far more popular choice at breakfast than a slice of chocolate cake. I was left feeling perhaps this was the point, and the hotel was intent on making as much money out of its customers as possible (note customers, not guests). Case in point being charged 5 EUR for ice.. hardly a Marriott 5 star standard in our experience.
I have written a separate review of the restaurant, which I again, found disappointing. 
The staff are incredibly friendly, and do the best they can within the parameters they are set- they were apologetic and welcomed feedback. But it is the policies of management (which are so alien to many of the great experiences we have had at other Marriott hotels) that really let this hotel down. I suggest they take a trip to the Marriott Marquis in Dubai for a lesson in how to really run a hotel, according to the standards we expect as regular guests at other Marriott hotels. 
The staff and building pull this up to average, otherwise, I would rate this as poor.",3,2015,09,08
13,Wonderful surprise,"Having never been to Barcelona, we were booking blindly. We used a search of Marriot properties to choose. We were pleasantly surprised. Location was very walkable to Ramblas, but off the beaten path. Hotel was small and well appointed. Restaurant was delicious. Staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Best for adults. Was a wonderful way to begin our vacation in Spain. ",5,2015,09,07
13,Terrific hotel! A stay to remember,"My girlfriend and I recently stayed two nights at the Cotton House; and we weren't disappointed.

The whole hotel has a fantastic atmosphere to it and the decor is terrific.  Our room was lovely; beautifully laid out with a large bathroom.  It overlooked the rear courtyard where we had breakfast on both mornings.  There was an excellent choice for breakfast with the ever attentive staff on hand to deal with any requests one might have. 

The Bar in the evening has a wide selection of drinks, all served in the splendid surroundings of this unique hotel in the heart of Barcelona.

The service provided was superb.  On the Friday evening I asked my girlfriend to marry me at the Font Magica (she said yes by the way!) and upon the Hotel finding out about this we returned to our room to find a bottle wine set out along with a very touching message, congratulating us both, written on the mirror in our room.  A very nice thing to have done and something my fiancé and I will remember fondly.

Both of us would definitely recommend the Cotton House as a place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,07
13,Best in Barcelona,"Wow, what a great treat this stay was.  The location is terrific and the newly opened property is outstanding but what sets this place apart is the people.  Every single employee works to make your visit the best- truly remarkable.",5,2015,09,07
13,"Elegant hotel,friendly staff, beautifully located","You simply must book a trip to Barcelona and stay at The Cotton House! An historic building has been transformed into an elegant hotel, keeping some of the history and giving its guests a truly first class experience. The staff is friendly and helpful, our room was beautifully appointed, and the restaurant was excellent in both food and service.",5,2015,09,06
13,Overall great-restaurant service let it down for 5/5,"The hotel itself was amazing. Great location right in the centre of Barcelona. The majority or staff were brilliant, the reception and door men especially. Very pleasant and attentive. The room we had, 303, was beautiful and the bed one of the comfiest I stayed in, and the room was very soundproofed-we couldn't hear a thing. Only downside was the restaurant. We had breakfast included but only ate there once out of two opportunities-the first was not what I expected from a hotel of that standard. The food was not hot and we asked four times for milk! Service here lacked unfortunately. Felt although they gave more attention to those guests they thought had more money?! We also went for a drink here in the evening and the service was under par. Apart from that hiccup though the stay was fab and we would recommend- just maybe eat/drink elsewhere!",4,2015,09,06
13,Highly recommended,"The Cotton House is a beautiful and comfortable hotel,  well located.  We had a quiet room overlooking the back patio.  The best part of our experience was the wonderful service provided by Ruben Fernandez and his colleagues at the Cotton House. ",5,2015,09,05
13,Perfection,"Maybe the best hotel stay I've ever experienced. The only down was staying one night.

Front desk staff were amazing. We got into both of our rooms by 11:00AM. The quality of service throughout the hotel reflected what must be a significant level of training invested by Marriott in the staff. Overall every staff member was very young. I was repeatedly amazed by their genuine interest in my needs.

Outdoor patio off the restaurant area is gorgeous. Great place for a late night drink and dessert. Seemed like there was a large number of locals enjoying the scene.",5,2015,09,05
13,Spectacular! ,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful staff, and awesome room. This hotel also had great breakfast! Staff made our stay, for my partner's 50th birthday, very special - wine, cake, birthday card, and special message written on one of the mirrors. Fantastic location in Barcelona, as well. Highly recommended!! ",5,2015,09,04
13,Lovely and well located...,"The hotel is in a converted cotton mill on the edge of the old city of Barcelona and is lovely.  The parlor level and the first floor are connected by a dramatic staircase and the common areas are tastefully and thematically appointed.  The restaurant and terrace bar are both comfortable and inviting.  The place felt homey and looks chic. There is a pool on the roof but I didn't use it. It looked nice.  Kinda small but appropriate for a city property.  The rooms are spacious with a terrace.  Well thought out and appointed.  The bed could have been more comfortable.  It felt like there was a synthetic cover over the mattress that didn't allow for cool comfort.  A little weird in a property named after a natural fabric.  
The staff were all cast from a modeling agency.  Each and every one is good looking....Which didn't necessarily translate to competence.  Example: The concierge was asked to book our dinner plans one evening and when she couldn't get us into our first choice restaurant, she simply dropped the ball.  We were left to scramble for a dinner table at 10PM. Not cute.  Aside from that small misstep, the hotel is really a fine choice in a city filled with MEGA properties like The W and the Arts.  (Both look cool but are not at all my style....)",4,2015,09,02
13,Amazing,"Such beautiful hotel ,clean,friendly,helpful, perfect location. So very happy thanks for your hospitality  : this is a must hotel ,it has very thing ::the breakfast was great , the garden so nice , swimming pool is a bit small but it didn't matter , food excellent and the staff on 1st floor so help full",5,2015,08,31
13,"Lovely hotel, great location and very friendly staff",The hotel and bedroom were both stunning. Facilities were great and breakfast was fantastic. Staff were lovely especially the concierge staff who were really helpful and made some great restaurant  recommendations.  I did think restricting complimentary tea/coffee in the bedroom to the first day was a little tight as it is nice to have a coffee each morning when you wake up. A fantastic stay and great location to explore a stunning city.,5,2015,08,30
13,"beautiful hotel, great location and the friendliest staff you can ask for","I will be checking out tomorrow and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. I read a few bad reviews but I dont think they are warranted. mistakes will happen, wherever you stay, but the important think is how these mistakes are handled, and the staff at the cotton house know how to treat a customer. from the second we arrived we were greeted by everyone in a very personable way and given first class service.  the beds are extremely comfortable the shower very unique and nice and the common areas are beautiful.  This hotel deserves 5 stars and the staff deserve even more",5,2015,08,30
13,new/clean but people and process may still need some work,"the public spaces are beautiful and it's in a great location to visit Barcelona.
but it's a new hotel so while the rooms are clean the people are still learning their jobs it seems, especially in the restaurant.  the front desk staff also had some issues realizing they had charged me months earlier (both on checking and checking out) - it's a good thing I brought print outs of the emails they had sent me.
as far as the restaurant, we ate there for breakfast and dinner 3 times and lunch once - in 7 meals they were consistently confused, delayed and incorrect about orders taken, etc.  I'm actually not sure why we kept eating there other than it was the final stop on a month long tour and we were all pretty wiped.
William at the front door was A+
The concierge Olga was A++",4,2015,08,29
13,Smashingly good hotel and amazing service ,If you are looking for a one of kind gem with an amazingly helpful staff then The Cotton House is the place in Barcelona for you.  They gave us a wonderful tour the bar served us well past closing hours and every body made their best effort to make sure we were thrilled with our stay.  Wow!  ,5,2015,08,28
13,Stunning hotel,"A beautiful boutique hotel with exquisite interiors and attention to detail. The 'cotton' smell hits you as soon as you walk in and travels throughout the hotel - something you can buy in a room spray or candle to take home with you. The staff were second to none, making us feel at home from the moment we checked in. We had a fantastic meal in the hotel restaurant with lots of complimentary dishes thrown in for us to try.

The only drawback was the size of the room we were assigned - it was far too small for two people, and there's no view from the window, which faced directly on to another wall. Though the room rate was quite reasonable for the level of hotel, I still would have hoped for a bit more of an airy feel. Our room had an adjoining door to another room which was unlocked when we arrived. The walls are paper thin and we were woken each morning to the sound of neighbouring families - not great for a five star luxury hotel. The bathroom was also dirty when we arrived with forgotten possessions from the previous guests under the sink.

Apart from the slight flaws with the room, the hotel was a gorgeous retreat in Barcelona and we were very sad to leave. We will definitely be back - but this time we will make sure to book a better room!",5,2015,08,26
13,Beautiful hotel,"I have stayed in many hotels and I must say that The Cotton House in Barcelona even though it didn't have all the amenities like the big chains was my favourite hotel of all. It was elegant , classy and the service was second to none. Our room was fantastic . The shower , toiletries and towels were incredible. This may seem trivial to most but our experience was incredible. This was one of our many stays during our honeymoon and was most memorable. The staff were extremely hospitable and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and look forward to us returning. 
Thank you again for a wonderful stay and incredible end to our honeymoon. ",5,2015,08,26
13,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service, great restaurant, perfect location","Due to the outstanding service throughout the hotel, I was surprised to learn it was only recently opened. The restaurant has excellent food and was very accommodating in adjusting all my meals due to gluten sensitivity. They even loaned us a wine bucket and champagne cork to take to our room! The concierge was very helpful in planning our itinerary before we arrived and during our stay. The rooms are very large for a European hotel with all the amenities you could ask for. I am a very light sleeper but no issues in this hotel! Easy walking distance to many of the main sites in Barcelona!",5,2015,08,25
13,Lovely dinner on the Terrace ,Enjoyed a lovely meal here with friends. Another gem in interior designer Lazaro Rosa Violan's repertoire. I will return to try the brunch. Great service. We even got a tour of the hotel before our dinner reservation. Lots of attention to detail! ,5,2015,08,24
13,Really beautiful hotel,Stayed here in July and would definitely return to this hotel if returning to Barcelona. Great staff and so many of them. Nice courtyard for breakfasts and evening meals. Great location for walking to La Ramblas. Pool on roof very welcome. Bedroom fresh and very comfortable with balcony. Separate wet room/bath. Beware though as you step out of wet room floor can be slippery. Why one coffee cup and one tea cup??,5,2015,08,23
13,Anniversary Trip,"We spent our 10th anniversary at the Cotton House and it was a fabulous property in the heart of Barcelona.  We loved how unique the hotel was with all the great designs.  The staff was great and always available to help!  It was a small property, but had all the amenities you could ask for.  It was walking distance to all the places you would visit in the city.",5,2015,08,22
13,COTTON BABIES,"This hotel has so much potential!  We stayed after it had been open only 5 months.  The renovations to the building are really easy on the eyes – the colors, the lighting, the décor, etc.  The food at the restaurant was good.  The service is not where it needs to be yet.  The staff is very young and maybe a little under trained.  The front desk was unable to exchange money, which is pretty standard for this type of hotel.  The rooms are pretty tight.  The housekeeping didn’t seem to stay consistent with their cleaning protocol.  There were long waits for just a drink outside…and it really wasn’t busy.  They were not able to recommend many places to eat nearby.  My friend in Barcelona wanted to surprise us with flowers and wine upon our arrival.  She was born and raised in Barcelona and had a very hard time getting the staff to answer her questions, assist her, follow up with her, etc.  It all worked out in the end, just that it was like pulling teeth to get some things done.  Their workout room had one bike, one treadmill (broken) and a set of barbells.  If you’re looking to get some workouts in while on vacation, you may want to consider a good run through Barcelona instead.  The pool is located on the 2nd level and the view is pretty cool!!  You can see the some of the iconic sites of Barcelona from the pool.  This place has some REAL potential, just needs a little work to get there",3,2015,08,21
13,"Superb service, beautiful atmosphere ","The hotel has been opened only six months, but the renovation work they did was amazing and kept a lot of the old building features that used to house the Cotton Council in Barcelona (before which belonged to a powerful cotton family). It's a graceful blend of the historical and modern; I would encourage you to take a quick tour with the bellhop. 

For the price we paid, the rooms felt slightly small but were clean and bright (maybe this is just an European thing). The winning features were a balcony that overlooks the green outdoor restaurant patio (wasn't loud and shutting the windows kept out all sound) and a dedicated room just for the shower and tub (rain shower and deep tub that made me feel like a queen).

The restaurant is worth visiting. The decor is elegant, from the original wood floors and mosaic tiles to the gleaming wall displays of vintage glassware and bound cotton samples. The food and service was excellent - they nouveau cuisined typical Spanish dishes, of which my favorite was the foie gras bonbons.

The concierge was excellent as well - patient as you searched the exact dates and times for all the overpacked tourist sights to which you'll inevitably want to go.

Cherry on top was the small rooftop pool - a quick dip erased all the fluster that the summer heat can bring on.

Disclosure: I stayed here with my parents and would splurge again when my pocket book allows!",5,2015,08,21
13,"Amazing staff, service, cleanliness, and tranquility from the hustle/bustle","The entire staff (especially Claudia) went above and beyond in meeting our needs. They were friendly, attentive, and happy to help us with anything we needed.  Check in/out was fast and easy.  The hotel and its rooms were beautiful, opulent, and clean.   The only criticism we had, and this is to no fault of the staff, was that some prices we felt were a bit high ($28 euro breakfast buffet, $25 euro in-room sandwich).  Bottom line:  If and when we return to Barcelona (and we hope we will), Cotton Hotel will be our #1 choice.",4,2015,08,20
13,Stylish romantic break,"Gorgeous luxury hotel that has an excellent restaurant, beautiful terrace  and small plunge pool. The location is on a main road but the double glazing means it's quiet. Rooms are a good size but not huge, the bed was so comfortable and the bathroom spacious. The extras are expensive and rather mean e.g 5 euros for a small bottle of water from the mini bar! It's a few minutes walk to the metro and about 20 mins walk to the Ramblas ( Central but busy). Nice for couples wanting a relaxed break and not minding being a taxi ride from time to time when walking in the heat gets too much! I would return and recommend it to like minded friends.",4,2015,08,20
13,Beautiful hotel with great customer service!,This hotel is a gem in the wonderful city of Barcelona.  The service was top notch and the restaurant recommendations were spot on.  The breakfast in the morning is well worth it.  The decor of the hotel needs to be seen and the most comfortable beds in all of Europe are located here.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our 5 nights here and truly enjoyed our conversations with all members of the staff.  Our comfort and enjoyment were their top priority and their recommendation to spend a day in Stiges was truly appreciated.  Bravo Cotton House!!!  In addition the entire hotel smells amazing!,5,2015,08,20
13,"Almost a 5, but it had just opened before our stay.","We found the Cotton House (a brand new hotel at the time) through the Marriott website and booked two rooms through the Marriott. The hotel is in a great location, within walking distance to many popular sights in Barcelona. The rooms are spacious and modern. We weren't sure how we felt about the layout of the bathroom at first, but it ended up being very comfortable and functional. The hotel has been beautifully restored and updated to suit modern standards. The restaurant on premises is a little expensive, but very good. It's a great place for tapas/light lunch and a bottle (or two) of Cava while jet lagged and waiting to check into your room. Breakfast was perfect with a great selection of Spanish foods. We were a little hesitant at first because there are so many fabulous choices in Barcelona, but out of exhaustion ended up having dinner at the hotel one night and the meal did not disappoint. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our only complaint was they never had change for tipping. We have stayed at several different hotels in Barcelona through the years and will definitely stay at the Cotton House the next time we are in town as we loved the hotel and are sure they will have worked out the kinks by then.",4,2015,08,19
13,Lunch ,"Fabulous location in the centre of Barcelona and the lunch was gorgeous, especially the chocolate dessert!! The staff were extremely helpful and friendly . We enjoyed looking at the beautiful detail of the decorations  of the hotel and had a relaxing lunch.",5,2015,08,19
13,Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona,"Anyone traveling to Barcelona should book their stay at the Cotton House Hotel. This is an exquisite property perfectly located to all major tourist areas. The hotel is a beautiful example of taste and elegance. The staff, eateries and service was impeccable. We look forward to our return to this great city and st.ay at Cotton House.",5,2015,08,19
13,My new secret hideaway in Barcelona,"Beautiful place, off the beaten track (Ramblas), very friendly staff and great service. And on top of it: affordable. Looks like this will be my place to stay when in Barcelona - but I won't tell anybody, or I won't get in anymore ...",4,2015,08,19
13,Great Stay ,"Staff - staff was extremely nice and hospitable.  Made my wife and I feel extremely welcome.  

Room - clean, chic, and made me look forward to returning after exploring Barcelona.  

Amenities - everything you'd like/want was available at the hotel. Really enjoyed the interior design of the hotel.  

Would I return? Absolutely

",4,2015,08,18
13,Great hotel,"This hotel is fairly new and somewhat boutique. With only 83 rooms the cotton house is an amazing hotel with all staff members greeting you by name whenever they see you. Their terrace restaurant is a lovely place to grab breakfast, lunch or dinner. 
Located on gran via, it's a stone throw from la rambla and plaça Catalunya. There are amazing restaurants and bars within walking distance and cabs to take you pretty much anywhere. ",5,2015,08,18
13,Fabulous!!,"This is one of the best hotels I ever stayed (and i stayed in many 5*, be it chain, classic luxury, boutique all over the globe). the atmosphere in cotton house is unbeatable. all the public areas of the hotel are perfection. the reception, the bar, restaurant, the library. simply breathtaking. even the stairs are an attraction. the terrace is an oasis. the rooftop pool is very nice and offers great views of the city. all the staff is just lovely, efficient and incredibly helpful. i stayed 10 mights in the duplex vichy suite with a large private terrace. fantastic and tastefully decorated. spotless clean and with all and more amenities one can ask for. highly recommend this hotel. 10/10.",5,2015,08,16
13,Beautiful hotel in a beautiful city,"We had a 2nd floor room facing the street (an upgrade).  Their commitment to the heritage of the building translates into really nice towels and sheets in addition to cotton-plant inspired decor in the room.  The room design is really nice, the bathrooms are decidedly high end with multiple shower heads in addition to a tub. The amenities are first rate. I don't normally note the mini-bar, but it was a really classy minibar with Champagne and a couple of very nice wines and crystal drinking glasses.
Leave time to explore the hotel's public spaces - they've been highlighted in Architectural Digest, and it shows.  If you're in the market for a bespoke men's dress shirt, they've got you covered as well, although you need to request the tailor in advance so it's not a good fit with a short visit unless you plan ahead.  
The location is great, walking distance to all of the historic / tourist areas.  The service was for the most part highly attentive and at the level for a hotel of this calibre.
I noticed another review saying ""not really up to Marriott standards"" and I disagree - this is Autograph Collection, which is the group of historic, unique, quirky hotels connected with the brand, and the Cotton House should be proud to find itself up there with the Algonquin in New York and the Adagio in San Francisco after such a short time.  No, it doesn't have an olympic pool or waffle machine at breakfast, but it's not supposed to.    
Negatives? It's much more designed as a romantic getaway than as a business hotel, by which I mean it's meant for people with flexible schedules rather than those on a strict itinerary.  We had to leave at 7:30am to catch our plane, and the (very very nice) breakfast that was supposed to open at 7:00am only opened at 7:15, and that after we and other guests trying to get to the airport asked.  On a normal vacation day, this would not impact us at all and we would have been happy to have a relaxed breakfast much later (bonus - breakfast goes to noon!)
We would definitely stay again!",5,2015,08,16
13,Good but not really Merriott quality,"This hotel is in a very good location easy walk to restaurants & interesting architecture & squares etc.  Close to several Metro stations.  Room are well laid out with separation between bedroom & separate showe/bathroom, toilet & sink washroom areas.  There is a beautiful wood lined staircase that makes you want to walk instead of using lift whenever you have nothing to carry. The library &'first floor sitting rooms are spacious & well decorated in a period style appropriate to the old house origins of t he property. Good breakfast choices & nice eating areas inside & on the terrace.  All that being said this does not make it to five stars.  For us a huge disappointment is not only is cigar smoking allowed on the terrace -- it is encouraged & promoted as a feature of the hotel.  We could smell the smoke on the fifth floor balcony & could not stay out after dark.  An even bigger disappointment especially compared to Marriotts in general was the service staff.  They were quite nice as long as there. We're no problems but they had a curiously defensive & resistant attitude when things were not perfect.  Rooms keys came deactivated @'around 1:00 pm on second day of five day stay which had to be because they were programmed for a single night, yet front desk told us that we had deactivated them instead of just re-activating them.  Even when told that it made no sense that three different people deactivated keys to two separate rooms at the same time.   WiFi did not work in one room & we given three or four different explanations of how we did not know how to connect -- even though we connected the same devises in the next room -- before hours later telling us that we had the only room in the hotel without WiFi.  One consierge sent us to a restaurant that did not exist &'then said we must have gone to the wrong place even when we showed her a picture of the address we were given &'a sign with that name but which was a store not a restaurant. Another consierge sent us to a terrible restaurant & when we simply said we did not like it, we were told that we just don't appreciate quality when we encounter it because he's been there & he thinks it's great. None of this necessarily means that the hotel should be avoided.  Over all we did like it but you just have to expect less than you would at a real Marriott.",4,2015,08,15
13,I totally agree with a comment below this.,"I totally agree with a comment below this.
 
People say watch your wallet in Barcelona it is easy to be pickpocketed. I feel like I was cheated by this hotel. They should've posted a picture of the window side deluxe room.

The view from my room was terrible. There was an air vent with a noisy so we couldn't open the window. Besides, the room was enclosed with the high wall right next to the building. as you might imagine, this hotel screwed up my first impression of Barcelona. I wonder how this hotel got five stars. 

I felt really stuffy and dry so I ask someone to change the room but they answered every deluxe room has same view so if I want to stay with a normal window view then I need to pay 100 euros more to get an updated room. even I booked with a pretty high price( it was almost 300euros.) I felt really sorry to my friend because I chose this hotel. it was just waste of money. actually the breakfast was good. I should've just visited this hotel restaurant.
Sorry to give you bad comments but it is true. Look at these pictures.",1,2015,08,14
13,Wonderful hotel experience!,"This has been the most fabulous hotel at which I've ever stayed. The location is fabulous; close walking distance to almost everything and close to the metro stations as well. The decor of the hotel is so beautiful, absolutely exquisite. Our room was gorgeous. A nice view from the 5th floor and the comfortable bed and shower were amazing!  But what makes the hotel the best is the staff who were friendly, attentive, outgoing, helpful and amazingly accommodating. A huge thanks to Angelo, Gigi, and Nuri-- the wait staff who made our experience so wonderful by chatting it up with us every night and offering suggestions for local restaurants, attractions, and night life. We took their suggestions and were never disappointed! Caroline at the concierge desk was AMAZING. I've never seen a concierge desk so helpful. She printed detailed maps with precise walking directions so we never got lost. Booking tours with her was a breeze.  The staff at the front desk bent over backwards to help you carry your bags, place items in your room if you decide you don't want to carry them around all day, open the elevator door for you, flag down a cab, etc. Everybody remembers your name and your likes/dislikes which made for a truly personalized experience. I simply cannot recommend this hotel enough. Thank you Cotton House!",5,2015,08,14
13,Beware of unauthorized charges!,"Two days after we checked out, a new charge appeared on my credit card from this hotel.  It was totally unrelated to me or my room number. The hotel refused to acknowledge their mistake. I suppose they hoped I wouldn't notice it. Also, my wife slipped and fell in the shower that had a floor like a sheet of ice when wet.",3,2015,08,13
13,Beautiful hotel in a good location,"Having been to Barcelona maybe 15 times i would clearly consider this location as very good for both shopping and business. The hotel is in an old converted town palace, and it has a beautiful design, respectfully restored to its former glory, especially in the common areas inside. It is worth a visit just to see and have a drink. The rooms, we tried both one Cotton room and one of the standard rooms during our twice stay during July, are both good. Beds are heaven to sleep in and both rooms with small balconies facing the yard and terrace. Both types of decent size, however not sure the price difference for the Cotton room is worth the extra lounge sofa and separate bathroom (the standard room has a bathroom connection shared with the hallway, but with separate shower/tub and toilet which worked very well we thought). That room also had a larger balcony. The hotel has a large terrace downstairs and a small pool on the roof. Staff where all very friendly and service minded, albeit very young as well. And that is maybe the reason for some minor irritating details which you would not expect to face in a hotel charging EUR 400+/night, such as; pool is not serviced (you have to go to your room and call room service), the bar closes at 0100 and no way to get a drink stronger than wine/beer (from your mini bar) unless you are lucky and able to catch one of the bar staff on their way to close down. I was lucky twice. There is misleading info regarding breakfast (in the rooms it says its served until 1200 at EUR 21 whilst actually it is until 11 at a cost of 28). The pool by the way didnt seem to be finished, with electical wires hanging around the walls. We where also told one evening they had no free tables in the restaurant inside, and had to opt for the ""last one"" outside. But when leaving later around 2300, they still had unoccupied tables inside. So these are the only reason for not awarding it top score. Anyway, the hotel is nice, and smells heavenly (yes, never thought i would say that about a hotel, go and smell!). We might give it another try next time in Barcelona even if this city is hotel heaven.",4,2015,08,12
13,Simply beautiful,"This hotel was perfect. I visited Barcelona with my niece for her high school graduation, so wi fi was essential to her, and connectivity was great. The hotel is gorgeous, wood floors, spiral staircases, great open rooms with fabulous bathrooms. But the service sets it apart. Greeting is warm and attentive, check in fast, people professional and accommodating. One night we were a bit lost, we called the front desk and they helped us orient ourselves and get back. Rooms very clean and airy. Concierge very knowledgeable and helpful. The breakfast was certainly not kid friendly, and food was a bit cold toward end of serving period, but spread had a lot of different things to try if you wanted a food adventure. Restaurant had very nice food but again, not kid friendly. Pool small. Great location, walking distance to Casa Mila  and Battlo (sp wrong) great shopping, close to Bario Gotic, and very easy to get cab out front but nothing very far. Good neighborhood, felt safe. Quick 20 minutes to airport.",5,2015,08,12
13,Stay away windowless rooms with NO LIGHT and extremely rude mangement,"I booked this hotel only because they were listed on Marriott website. It turned out the  rooms were without a window and light and too small. No access or light to the outside. Our rooms were a walk-in closet. This is illegal in US, but apparently legal in Spain. 

The windowless room was so small, that we had to ask to have furniture moved out so we can open our luggage's. There were no closet space. you could only hang a suit and that was it. The bed was a full size bed and not even a queen size bed.  

The hotel management refused to offer other rooms while they had availability. I called Marriott and they confirmed that there were other rooms available. Under their contract with Marriott they were required to provide an upgrade. However, they refused to offer an upgrade or offer a better room at a higher price. 

After so many back and forth between Marriott and me, and ruining my vacation they finally offered an upgrade to one of my rooms. even that room was too small. The sink was in the middle of the room. The shower opened to the room and the toilet door opened the room. Again, we had to ask to have furniture moved out so we can open our bags. 

The management is the worst. They have no shame to lie about anything and everything. Initially, they told me that the hotel is sold out for my entire stay. It turned out to be false. Marriott reservation confirmed this. They will do whatever necessary to lie to you and create a miserable atmosphere. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. If you wish to have a miserable time, you can stay in this hotel.",1,2015,08,11
13,"Good, but spotty","After reading all the great reviews, we decided to stay here during our time in Barcelona.  However, while it was a good stay, it lacked 5 star quality.

THE GOOD:
Location:  
Ideal.  Personally, we thought the location was great.  It is in between touristy sights like Las Ramblas, Barcelonetta Beach, Gotic Barre, Picasso Museum, etc. and sights more north like La Sagrada Familia, Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, etc.  The equivalent of 5th Avenue or Rodeo Drive is 5 minutes away.  It has a great combination of high end and more mid-range shopping.

It is a quick 2 min. walk to a taxi stand and 5 minute walk to one of the more central metro stops (Passeig de Gracia) where you can also catch the Renfe to beach towns like Sitges.  

Clientele: 
This may or may not matter to many people and we certainly liked that the clientele is older.  Many were retired or in their 50s.  We saw one family with teenage children, but it's definitely an older crowd.  So don't stay here expecting to party late or a rowdy bar scene.

THE NOT-SO-GOOD
Hotel:
The hotel itself is new so everything is very nice.  The room we had was quaint and had a good layout.  It was stylish, yet warm and inviting.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom clean and modern.  I thought this was a lot roomier than Rome.

The bathroom on the 2nd floor near the restaurant and bar needs to be cleaned.  We were there at 10am in the morning and the trash bins were already overflown with paper towels.  There was water everywhere on the floor.  It's definitely NOT 5-star quality.  The bathroom near the spa / pool area also untidy early in the morning.

Staff:
This is where it gets spotty.  Some reviewers said they got a tour of the property.  We arrived at around 11am and were not given a tour even though our room wasn't ready and could have used the time to get to know the hotel better.  We didn't know where anything was or what amenities they had to offer.  

This was the really disappointing part.  We had told them we were there to celebrate our anniversary and also separately emailed asking them to help with restaurant recommendations and assistance with making reservations.  They didn't do anything special for us, which is surprising for a ""5-star"" hotel and we did not hear back from them regarding recommendations.  Also, we always receive emails from the concierge prior to our stay asking if we need any help with anything, but we never got such an email from these guys.

Unlike some reviewers, we did not feel like the staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy and all our needs taken care of.  

Overall we are pretty independent travelers and seldom rely on the hotel services so it was an enjoyable stay, but it is definitely short of 5-star quality.",4,2015,08,11
13,"A 4 star, but not a 5 star Property","The Cotton House lived up to its Autograph Collection stature on most levels, but due to its layout and a few other shortfalls it probably can never reach 5 star status in my book.

Overall this is a very poshly decorated property located in the heart of Barcelona.  Build in an old textile building hence the name ""Cotton House"", they offer custom shirt making services, which is a unique tribute to their history.

The Pros
The staff was very friendly and helpful
Great architecture and decor
Very comfortable beds
Attentive concierge service
Rooftop terrace 
Balcony (small but a nice touch)

The cons
Due to being located in the heart of Barcelona space is a premium, so the room felt narrow and a little cramped.  (For European city hotel standards not bad, but your not going to get a massive room)

The shower had a strange door that only went half way down the length of the tub causing water to spray all over the floor when you showered.

The sinks drained very slow

Overall I'd say this is a very good choice for a couple who wants to be in the heart of the action and appreciates great architectural and decorative touches.   When staying in historic European cities your typically not going to find the space we've become accustomed to in modern hotels or resorts, so embrace the location and enjoy this wonderful city.

13,Fantastic Stay,"This hotel is an absolute gem located in the heart of the city within walking distance of many major sites and activities. The staff were of the highest caliber that I have experienced throughout my frequent travels staying at high end hotels. Any question or request we had was handled immediately and with the utmost attention to detail. Our room was kept fully stocked and extremely clean despite our frequent jet lag induced napping. The concierge, Carolinia, took extremely good care of us with tour bookings, dinner reservations and recommendations for activities. The staff were all bright, cheerful and more than willing to help with anything. This was our first trip to Barcelona but surely will not be our last and you can bet that will we stay here again.",5,2015,08,07
13,Nice Hotel,"We stayed at the Cotton House for 5 nights in July. It's a really beautiful hotel, almost feels like a museum when you enter. Our room was spacious and extremely clean. The shower was amazing. The breakfast that was included was fair, although anything warm had a surcharge. Unfortunately, I did find the food and drinks in the restaurant and room service were overpriced, but service was amazing. The staff was extremely helpful and respectful. The rooftop pool was great but became packed in the afternoons, with only about 10 loungers in total. Great stay overall.",4,2015,08,06
13,Perfect hotel,This was the best staffed hotel I have ever been to. The staff was so friendly from the moment we pulled up to the hotel until the moment we left. Brand new hotel so everything is in great shape. The rooms were amazing and so were the showers. This hotel was within walking distance to most of the major attractions. We would stay here again if traveling back to Barcelona!,5,2015,08,06
13,An UTTER rip-off.,"The said low-down: 

Room is suffocatingly small and turns out to be A LOT worse than appearing on website photos – chipped paint, cracking flooring and tainted tiles were observed in more than one place. 

The so-called balcony is a sheer joke – hardly enough space for a couple to sit and relax. 

Nightmare is the sound insulation – we heard noises from neighboring rooms and upstairs all the time!!! They must have done a terrible job in the flooring --- insufficient foundation, we surmise. 

Breakfast is just average and front desk staff are uptight and not very welcoming. We were left waiting at least 9 minutes upon check-in when there were three of them, each holding a phone speaking to somebody not present at the site: we were left unattended to. Such hospitality???

Balcony chair cracks at every move you try to make. Why do they not repair them regularly??? 

Faucet water pressure was not stable – sometimes it became heavy all of a sudden when you were washing your face and the temperature was strangely fluctuating. We sighed at this. 

In one of our days of stay, the chambermaid forgot to replenish the toilet tissue roll. When we got out for shopping, we particularly told the front desk to do it. But we found upon returning that nothing was done. 

The only plus point is its location. 

If you look for a decent place to sleep in, avoid this pretentious boutique hotel. We moved into Mandarin Oriental (which does NOT cost that much more than this one) which a million times BETTER than the Cotton House!!!",1,2015,08,06
13,Great staff,It was an excellent hotel with great location and very good welcoming and always smiling staff. Their concierge should be more trained as they are not very well informed about the city. The receptionist were way much informed about the city and mainly the night staff Alexis and Juadro. They were very helpful with us. I would highly recommend this hotel and the rooms with a balcony overlooking the terrace are nice. The first floor terrace is very relaxing. ,4,2015,08,05
13,Marriott's Spanish Masterpiece,"The Cotton House Hotel is simply a masterpiece which successfully fuses and celebrates classic Spanish architecture with modern luxury and conveniences.  Only opened a mere six months, it has an inviting and elegant presentation that extends from the cozy entrance/check-in area through the dining and common spaces into the guest rooms.   
Looking for a few days in Barcelona following a Mediterranean cruise, we chose the Cotton House because it was a ""Marriott""- it entirely exceeded our expectations. This is no common Marriott! I have now been schooled in Marriott's ""Autograph Collection""!
Strategically located a comfortable five-ten minute walk (five blocks) from the centre of the city (Placa Catalunya) and the infamous Las Ramblas, it is in a high-end, safe and comparatively quiet area of the city. From here, all areas of Barcelona are easily accessible.
We had two rooms. Our room type was the Egyptian, larger guest room, 1 king, sofa bed, with a courtyard view from the small balcony. Conservative but comfortable in size, it was tastefully decorated with impressive attention to detail. The presentation, creative lighting solutions and quality of decor and furnishings was an elegant mix of modern and timeless. 
I have slept in countless beds, but this one was arguably the most comfortable one I have ever slept in and worthy of an Egyptian Pharoah - the soft bedding envelopes you and is simply incomparable. 
The modern bathroom was fully outfitted with double sinks, make-up mirror, rainshower and hand wand option, with sufficient space for two to arrange their personals.
With respect to technology, as with the most modern European hotels, it was equipped with international AC outlet choices so there was no need for a U.S. adapter; There was also fast free wireless internet access and HGTV. 
Our children had the Cotton guest room with 2 twin beds, also with the courtyard view and balcony. In this room, there was a very creative use of the space with separate toilet and shower stalls, as well as a common sink area.  All of this was able to be totally separated by a pocket door that united the separate spaces!
The check-in was quick and efficient and overall service was outstanding - responsive and fitting of a five-star hotel. 
This latest addition to the Marriott Autograph collection takes it to another level and  is definitely worth a stay!  Highly recommended!",5,2015,08,01
13,Delivered Beyond for young American Couple (29 & 30 yr old),"During our two week journey through Spain this was the best hotel stayed. From the moment you walk in the staff is accommodating, décor is attractive with a welcoming entrance that appeals to a vacation/holiday traveler, and located in what I would call an ideal location. The rest of the hotel delivered, as I will get into that below.

Barcelona is spread out enough for those who like to wonder with the exception of the summer days heat interferes. That being said, it was my ideal location. We were able to walk to practically all the tourist destinations with the exception of Mt. Montjuic which is a 10 minute taxi ride. We started to wonder towards the beach through the side streets from the hotel and felt very safe if she wanted to wonder into boutiques while I looked at street art or whatever caught my eye. The neighborhoods that you would walk through to get to the water are absolutely worth strolling through from the hotel. It was within 15 minutes we were walking around the beach district (without stopping at a nice stroll, but you will be stopping ☺). After dinner our first night we wondered four blocks to Casa Batllo and La Pedrera where we were able to appreciate his works lit up without the onslaught of tourists. The Park Guell is a taxi ride away, maybe 10 minutes and worth going to during the day. If you are into Las Ramblas or not it is the appropriate distance for both. 

Beyond the friendly entrance the rest of the hotel met above our standards. It did not make you feel you were in a business hotel (although I would stay here if I were on business) and provided enough luxury through the rooms, common areas, and staff. I’d be surprised if you could enter or exit Cotton house without someone with a smiling hello. We stayed in a standard room that gave us both enough room to get comfortable, including the bigger than average in Europe bathroom. The room is exactly in the pictures on their website and feel better in there, smell and touch. The breakfast spread in the morning is worth going to everyday you wake up unless you have a specific place you want to eat breakfast. It will provide you with anything you would get outside the hotel with a swanky ambience that does a good job matching travelers to the city. My modest amount of Europe travel keeps me just under 50 hotels in Europe, but this breakfast was hands down my favorite. The pool is great for a siesta or cooling off after a day venturing. The only problem we found was that although it is quaint how we like it, it was full most days. It works both ways. You want tranquility when laying rooftop by the pool, but you also want to be able to get a spot. Plan accordingly if you want to go to the pool. I wouldn’t change the set-up because I personally appreciate this setting. There are many other nuances to this hotel I could dive into, take my word, for the price range it does not get much better.",5,2015,08,01
13,Beautiful!,Excellent service and a beautiful hotel.  The location was a short cab ride from Las Ramblas.  Clean room with soft linens.  We enjoyed a drink at the bar on the terrace with tapas and everything was spectacular.,5,2015,07,31
13,Just a fantastic experience in Barcelona,"Booked this hotel blind from NY, invited our friends from Switzerland, arrived and was pleasantly surprised. The staff are polite, quick to respond, always willing to help out, tours, booking tables, shipping items back to NY, car service. The facilities, roof top pool with great views, rear deck was great to relax, drinks, dinner sand such the, food and wine all exceeded our expectations. The decor of the hotel was a pleasant mix of old and new, but the hotel had all the modern convinces, air conditioning, no noise from roads. The rooms are wonderful, bed is large and luxurious, we had a balcony overlooking the courtyard. Rooms have very modern bathrooms, full tub, shower, separate toilet, own air conditioning, black out curtains. The location is perfect, walking distance to the Sagrada Família and high end boutiques, water front 5 minute taxi ride, great location for sight seeing. We are planning another trip here, would highly recommend. For families I would point out the pool is salt water, 3 feet deep, about 10 feet wide by 30 feet long, more of relax and lap pool, not a family jump in and slide environment, great place to cool off.",5,2015,07,30
13,Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location!,"The hotel is beautiful with amazing decor and in a perfect location. The staff is welcoming and the rooms are beautiful as well. I have only one issue: the cleanliness of the bathrooms in the rooms is below what I'd expect. Everything is white, making it essential to keep it very clean, but the baseboard and floors were dirty. There was shampoo on the shower wall the day we checked in, leading me to believe that the shower wasn't well cleaned following the prior guest. Although I was disappointed with this, I would still stay here again. ",5,2015,07,30
13,Cotton House vs Hotel Arts - Marriott Gold dilemma,"I read just about every review on Cotton House as our 7/9/15 stay was approaching.  I was very excited with the property.  I have several hotel ""statuses"" so I looked at Starwood, Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, etc.  I decided to pay outright and not use points.  Had two rooms booked.  One the same visit after our cruise we stayed at the Hotel Arts, so I wanted to give everyone my thoughts.

Big decision came down to Cotton House vs Hotel Arts.  I am a pretty average guy, 50 years old, not uppity but enjoy the finer things.  Neither hotel disappointed.  The details:

Someone else posted that Cotton House is not a 5 star hotel but a very nice boutique hotel.  This was right on target.  It is a great location, probably better than Hotel Arts unless you plan to spend a lot of time at the beach.  Shopping, restaurants, and a better taste of Barcelona.  As stated in other reviews, breakfast was exceptional.  Really outstanding considering what a standard european continental breakfast usually is.  We stayed in a Cotton category room.  Ours had a nice shower and bathroom.  Room wasn't that big, but big enough.  Room was nice, but again, not 5 star.  Balcony overlooked terrace but really faced the back of a lot of different buildings.  We were on the 3rd floor and would probably recommend a bit lower so you get the patio feel instead of the hanging laundry feel.  We had a problem in our room with water under the floor board that was seeping up and through.  We reported to front desk, they addressed right away but the problem never went away.  I was more concerned with what this will do to the floor more than any inconvenience.  Maintenance guys were friendly and great when they came up.  Curiously the front desk never offered to do anything for us.  I am not a real complainer and wouldn't have accepted anything nor another room, but still kind of surprised no corrective action was offered.  Staff was very, very friendly and even a bit overstaffed.  This is due to all of the summer interns.  Although it gave a little feel of ""still learning polished service"" I found this to be really refreshing.  Young people with a great attitude.  Others might be turned off by it.  My daughters stayed in a separate cotton category room.  Theirs had the combined bathtub and shower in the same stall area.  This also had the sink exterior to the bath area right where you first entered the room.  I didn't care for the configuration but my daughters were happy with it.  There was a problem with this room as the outlets for our converters in one wall didn't work.  Wasn't a big deal, cell phone chargers and converters were simply plugged in by the sink area as those outlets worked.  We reported this on the second or third night of our stay.  Curiously once again, no corrective action was offered nor addressed.  Wasn't a big deal, but it does help you feel that you are heard and that they care.  I think maybe because they were booked full and maybe didn't have a solution.  I asked about a gold free upgrade upon arrival and they said the only room they would have would cost us a whole lot more.  Must have been their best suite that was kept open just in case.

Overall I was expecting a bit more because I probably built it up too big in my mind based on early reviews.  I will say the Palace hotel is only a few doors down and I would look at that as well as we had dinner there one night and exceptional old world service.  My recommendation is if you get a good rate it is a very nice hotel in a good area to stay.  Just don't overpay.  Sorry guys, but I would say if priced comparably I would probably return to the Hotel Arts first as that hotel was exceptional in every way.",4,2015,07,29
13,Amazing terrace but lacks in service,"From the ethos to even the scent, the Cotton House Hotel is a great hotel. The traditional looks companioned with the excellent location truly makes this hotel fantastic. However, one of the ""big"" things about the rooms in the hotel is that they get cleaned twice a day but upon arrival and on the day of departure there was a substantial layer of dust on the lamps which clearly showed that the rooms were not cleaned twice a month let alone a week. The main highlight of the hotel must be the terrace. The tranquility and plethora of drinks provided made it a great place to be. The one feature it lacked was service to match it. Th staff were more than friendly but sometimes are drinks never turned up. Nevertheless, the Cotton House Hotel is a first class hotel and will be coming back in the near future.",5,2015,07,29
13,Hotel Stay was Very nice,"We stayed 2 separate days at the Cotton House.  The first time we got there check in was very slow and our room was not ready.  It's a small hotel so unlikely for rooms to be ready before 3pm.  When we finally got our room it was very nice and comfortable.  Great location, walking distance of Las Ramblas.  Staff was very nice, especially Gemma",4,2015,07,28
13,First class all the way !!!!,"We can say enough above the staff at the Cotton House.  The staff were always greeting us with smiles and we're professional and gracious. 
We absolutely loved the fresh smell when you first walked into the lobby each time. Day or night. 

Incredibly safe location and ease to get to all major points. 

Hop on hop off bus only 5 min walk to a stop. 

Clean quiet and really just perfect. ",5,2015,07,26
13,Great hotel choice with amazing service!,"The hotel is newly renovated, and the attention to customer service is unparalleled.  The staff is relatively new but are extremely pleasant and accommodating.  We received a tour of the hotel upon arrival and felt at home the entire time.  We greatly enjoyed our 5-night stay at the Cotton House and its location is so centrally located, that you can easily walk to most attractions in Barcelona or catch the nearby hop-on, hop-off bus.",5,2015,07,26
13,Beautiful,"The hotel is beautiful!  I looked for a hotel that was close to the Paseig de Graci (sp?) and that would have good a/c.  The a/c is important to me for a good nights sleep-- and since it was 103 during our visit, I was very happy to have a chilly room!  The rooms are definitely small-- we had 2 Panama rooms.  I was pleasantly surprised when our room had a king bed and our girls' (college aged) room (which connected to ours) had a queen.  Each room was adequate for having a large suitcase per person and carryon bags.  The rooms had a view of the interior courtyard-- not anything to look at, but we weren't there to hang out and relax in the room.  They had very creative lighting that made the room feel bright and airy.  The high ceilings also helped make the rooms feel larger than they were.  Bathrooms in both rooms were very elegant and nicely appointed with HUGE, lush bath towels and robes.  The hotel itself was quiet.  We did hear a fair amount of noise in the hallways and heavy doors slamming- but it's not a huge property so it wasn't a ton of people traipsing up and down all night.  If you are close to the staircase, you will hear people going up and down especially if they are wearing flip flops and ""flipping"" loudly....  We are Marriott gold so we were given breakfast vouchers.  The buffet was adorable and quite tasty.  Yogurt, granola, fresh fruit, pastries, cold meats, juices, smoothies, coffee/tea-- very nicely presented.  The outdoor terrace was fantastic and the indoor seating was quite nice as well.  The overall atmosphere and surroundings were pleasant and inviting.  The beds and linens were quite comfortable.  All of our interactions with staff were very nice.  The only ""mishap"" was when a housekeeper came around  knocking and opening doors asking for ""laundry"" and came into my room with the ""do not disturb"" sign outside.  I neglected to turn the bolt, but still it was a bit annoying that when I didn't answer he still came in the door.  So if you are trying to rest in the afternoon, put out the sign and lock the door-- but you will hear them hollering ""laundry"" all down the halls....  Would not hesitate to stay at this property again!",5,2015,07,23
13,Beautiful hotel from the Marriott Autograph Collection,"We stayed here for a family vacation for 4 nights. The building has a lot of history and Marriott have done a wonderful job restoring it and keeping it's character. Location wise, it is very close to the top of Las Ramblas and the Metro. The front desk staff were very attentive and helpful. The rooms were lovely and the beds were very comfy. We had booked 2 kings but ended up with a king and a queen (no reason was given for this). There was a very small pool on the top floor - ok for a quick dip, but only waist height on me. Breakfast was also included (maybe because of my Marriott status) which was a nice plus. The breakfast was buffet style and to my kids delight included a big array of desserts - a good way to start the day! We also use the restaurant for cocktails in the evening (very expensive - 7 euro for a tiny bottle of coke). This was a bit of a hit or miss - there were many staff milling around, but sometimes they always seemed busy doing something else. We waited over 20 minutes one evening to order drinks - after I pestered them, the services was attentive. I put this down to growing pains. The hotel has only been opened for a couple of months, so they are still finding their feet. Even though this stay was for vacation, this hotel would suit business travelers very well.",5,2015,07,23
13,Beautiful!,Upon walking inside the front door we were pleasantly surprised. We were greeted immediately and guided to the registration desk.  Fresh cherries were offered to us. This location has only been open several months and Marriott should be very proud of the property and staff. There are quite a few interns working here for the summer.  They were all quite lovely. Everything here was done first class.  The rooms are small but very nicely appointed. The bathrooms are a nice size for a hotel in the city center.  The pool was  small but sufficient for adults. The breakfast buffet was very good.  If you are a Marriott rewards Chairmanship Club member breakfast is included. If we are ever back in Barcelona we will definitely come back and stay.,5,2015,07,22
13,A 5-stars hotel that deserve 3-stars,"Three days in this hotel at a rate of >270 euros per night. The room was so tiny that there was no place to turn or to put your luggage, I can call it a rat room (no windows). The service was also out of order for the 5-stars they claim. They employ nice and young people but they have no clues for a 5-stars service. I do not mind paying but I expect the service to be of quality. This hotel has nothing for itself, except that is has been well restored. I travel a lot worldwide and will never come back to the Cotton house in Barcelona.",1,2015,07,22
13,Gorgeous,"Barcelona is filled with so many excellent hotels in desirable locations that all happen to be in the same price range and have equally stellar reviews.  While this is a great “problem” to have, it actually made the decision even tougher.   In the end, I could not have been happier with the Cotton House Hotel.  The pictures on the website have not been doctored in any way.  The hotel is truly that beautiful.  It used to be an old cotton mill and a great deal of the structure was preserved.  Rather than take a chance on a random boutique hotel, we knew that a Marriott property must meet certain quality standards.  We stayed at the Cotton House less than 3 months after it opened its doors and every detail was exquisite with service to match.  The personnel clearly went through a great training program to pull off such a feat.   The front desk were very helpful in meeting our needs at all times.  

Like any new establishment, there were a couple of things that could be improved upon.  The concierge service was ready to help at any time but since most were not from Barcelona or Spain, they did not have as much knowledge about the city.   The bar/restaurant area is a gorgeous place to enjoy a cocktail but the bartender seemed to take an unnecessarily long time filling drink orders for a very limited number of customers.  Fortunately, these issues did not bother us since we were not in any rush and we had already done plenty of research about Barcelona on my own.  I am confident that the staff will become more efficient as they settle into their roles. 

The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and tastefully decorated. We upgraded to the Madras King room, which was a good size so I assume the Panana room would have been a bit cramped.  The hotel was pretty centrally located on the busy Gran Via, on the edge of the Eixample district, close to Placa de Catalunya and the gothic quarter.  It is not considered a “pretty” area but it felt safe and was walking distance to public transportation, the Passieg de Gracia shopping area, and Las Ramblas.  I would highly recommend this beautiful property.",5,2015,07,22
13,"Beautiful, quiet and in a great location","The service and the decor are unbeatable, the entrance to the hotel keeps an air of the private luxury building it once was and just to go to the terrace is worth the trip. They have managed to keep a colonial feeling with all the new commodities like great internet connection and excellent cuisine.",5,2015,07,22
13,A pleasant reprieve. ..,Arrived exhausted and was met with an offer of cold water and cherries. The hotel decor is stunning; a beautiful mixture of modern and antiques. The service is excellent and the rooms are nicely decorated and comfortable.  Location is excellent. A great respite from days of exhausting sight seeing. I will stay here in the future.,5,2015,07,19
13,Beautiful Hotel Great Location,Stayed for a weekend with my girlfriend. Lovely and romantic with beautiful rooms. Service was faultless and location couldn't have been better. Breakfast was excellent and their terrace wonderful. Highly recommend it! It also smells fantastic!,5,2015,07,19
13,Excellent Decor and Service,"We stayed here twice on a recent visit to Spain. There are many appealing aspects of this new property. First, while the staff is young and some need a little more experience, they are all very friendly and eager to help with any request. We truly felt well treated by all. Second, the breakfast is absolutely sumptuous. It's not as wide a selection as one may have come to expect from a 5 star hotel, but there is plenty to choose from and I couldn't help but treat myself to a red velvet cupcake every morning. Third, the public spaces have been artfully restored to make you feel like you are in a grand home, perfect for relaxing away the afternoon with a drink. Finally, the wifi was super fast!

We did learn during our two stays that there is quite a disparity in rooms. Our first 3 nights were in a room facing the rear courtyard. It had a wonderful balcony which brought in lots of natural light, separate rooms for the shower and toilet, and plenty of space. It was truly the best of the two rooms we were assigned. After returning from an overnight in Bilbao we were assigned room, 409. It faced the interior, had no view and the shower, sink and toilet area were combined. It was clearly designed for a handicapped person, which I can understand the hotel needs to have, but more work should be done to prevent a shower from getting the entire bathroom wet. Do try to avoid this room if you can. 

The rooftop pool and deck has nice views but is small so you have to time your visit right. I would also suggest that you can get more exercise outside the hotel than in their very small ""gym"" - though that's a better use of your time anyway. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel for its wonderful design, friendly staff, and good location. Just be sure you ask about the room ahead of time as this can make all the difference. We would definitely stay here again if given a courtyard room.",4,2015,07,18
13,Excellent,"The hotel is in an old building that used to be a privately owned house many years ago, there are a lot of existing features that have been kept which gives this hotel a uniqueness. The rooms were very contemporary and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in. The staff were very professional & nothing was too much trouble. Its in a good position to walk to the main attractions, restaurants, shops etc",5,2015,07,17
13,Outstanding Hotel,My wife and I just returned from a trip to Europe that included a stay at the Cotton House. I would rate this hotel as good as or better than any Four Seasons hotel that we've stayed in. The facilities are excellent. The staff is outstanding and always looking to make you feel welcome. We hated to have to leave.,5,2015,07,16
13,Cotton House is A+++,"We stayed here recently, the room was beautiful, very clean & spacious. The staff is very nice & accommodating. The hotel is centrally located . There is a great rooftop bar area that is excellent for drinks.",5,2015,07,15
13,Stunning hotel on Barcelona trip,"The details in this hotel are stunning.  It's a special place, a work of art, and extremely relaxing.

The place has plenty of staff and they are all very friendly.  Everyone I encountered from the bellmen, front desk, housekeepers, bartender, and severs were nice, friendly, and attentive.

The location is incredible and in the heart of the city.  You can get to anywhere in the city with a 5-10 min cab max.

The only downsides - the pool on the roof and the gym are quite small.  The rooms could be a tad bigger.

Bottom Line - Amazing hotel with stunning details in the heart of the city.",5,2015,07,15
13,One of my favorite hotels,The Cotton House Hotel is one of my favorite big cities hotels.  It is very comfortable to stay at.  The first floor (which is the second floor) has a beautiful library and bar.  The first two floors were a private residence at one time.  Twenty foot ceilings that are beautiful.  The rooms aren’t very large but are easy to get around and well furnished.   The shower was very nice.  They have a small rooftop pool that we used not only for swimming but to relax and have a bottle of wine.  They provide plastic wine glasses and a wine bucket.  We had bought a bottle of wine at a local vineyard.  They used a lot of interns for help and they were very pleasant and helpful.,5,2015,07,14
13,I want to live here,"From the time we entered to the time we left, we felt pampered, special, and enjoyed our surroundings. Beautiful attention to detail; and that delicious smell that I enjoyed so much every time we came into the building. (they sell home fragrance or candle so you can enjoy  it when you get home...I did indulge). Just a wonderful oasis that was truly appreciated after a day of touring during the heat wave!",5,2015,07,14
13,Charming boutique style hotel,Decor and staff each get five stars.  Location is great as well.  We had the panama room which was very small (but at least the ceilings were tall).  Housecleaning missed a few small details/dust but overall average.  Loved the rooftop pool but they need to have fans or misters as it was too hot to be up there in the summer unless you're in the pool the whole time.  I'd absolutely stay here again!,4,2015,07,13
13,Beautiful Hotel in Barcelona,We were overnighting in Barcelona before beginning a 12 day Med cruise.  This hotel was beautiful and in a good location to walk to all the sites we were interested in seeing.  While the rooms were European in size they held all the emenities you could want.  We enjoyed a lot of very dinner in there restaurant.  As this is a Merriott property we chose it because we are Marriott rewards members.,5,2015,07,12
13,Aesthetically 5 star but rest of it is Mickey Mouse,"I was so excited to stay here especially after reading the recent Telegraph article.  The hotel is very nicely appointed on first glance but the longer you linger it starts feeling like a cheap shine job.

Despite being platinum Marriott we were not afforded an early check in.  We were sent to a tapas tourist trap down the street where we waited 30 minutes for mediocre tapas (it was called Ciutat Comtal, I would avoid it).  We came back from lunch and went to our room which was very very small.  I'm talking Hudson Hotel New York small.  It was also incredibly hot.  We came to find during our first night sleep (if you could call it sleep) that our AC was bring governed.  We would set it to 17 it would turn on for a few minutes and then shut off.  Finally at 3am we called for a fan.  Nothing like having hotel staff in your room at 3am while your girlfriend is naked under the covers.  The temperature stayed around 33 Celsius (91F).

In the morning I complained and they magically got it to be frigid in our room the rest of our stay which was nice.

The gym is a treadmill and stationary bike with some weights that go up to 8kg.  The rooftop pool is very nice but incredibly small and shallow.  Unfortunately it gets monopolized by children so you just need to plan accordingly.  We ordered margatitas to the roof and they came half full tasting like lemom drops and they charged us 5euro extra than what thet charge in the bar.  The waitress never came back but I took a picture and got it removed on checknout.

We had drinks on the 2nd floor terrace which was nice but the drinks are not very good.  I would stick with wine or beer or something neat.  We asked for a check from our waitress which we never got. When I went to find her I don't think she was working there anymore so finally the bartender rang me up.

And finally, on checkout, I tried to use a Marriott gift card (only reason I stayed here) and they told me they couldn't accept it since the are so new.  They said they could copy the number and process it later but would still need to charge my card.  That sounded very complicated so I just charged it.

This hotel is unfortunately kind of a joke and is definitely not 5 stars.  The staff is very nice but not very competent.  The bell hop who helped us with our bags on the way out was great.",2,2015,07,12
13,Excellent but good luck getting twin beds,"Great location and staff apart from the rude guy on reception who told me that booking a twin bed room was only a request and the solution was two single duvets wrapped in sheets ( no duvet covers )  on a double bed , after two nights these were inexplicably replaced by a double duvet . Also every morning we were told that breakfast wasn't included despite it being shown on our booking form as included .
Concierge was excellent . Small but clean rooms . Water is put in the room daily but you are then charged €10 for the two small bottles .",4,2015,07,10
13,Swanky but not stuffy! Perfect stay!,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights...we wish we could've stayed longer!  The hotel was fantastic, and the positive reviews are accurate.  The hotel staff was friendly and most helpful (great recommendations for dinner!), and the hotel itself is beautiful.  It does have a ""boutique-y,"" upscale, swanky feel, but it's not stuffy or snobby - it does have that Marriott customer service you expect.  
Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the street and was perfectly comfortable - no noise from below.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower had great water pressure.  
We did have the opportunity to spend a few hours at the rooftop pool which is small, but lovely, lined with comfortable lounge chairs.  You can see the Sagrada Familia from a distance.  
The breakfast buffet was just fantastic!! So much to choose from, so delicious! 
When we come back to Barcelona, without a second thought, we would stay here again.  It is so centrally located (about a 30EUR taxi ride from the airport), and within a few blocks walking distance to La Rambla.  Great restaurants and shopping are just around the corner.  Convenient to everything!",5,2015,07,10
13,This hotel is still evolving!,"This is a nice hotel, no doubt about it. But it is suffering some growing pains.
Newly opened in February or March of 2015, the staff is young and inexperienced, but they are very, very nice!
The rooms are nice, nothing exquisite that I have seen, but very comfortable.
For a ""new"" hotel, some of the furnishings are looking a little abused but overall, it's not a bad place to call home for a few days or weeks as the case may be.

The restaurant staff needs a bit more training on even basic things like how to pour a cup of coffee!  A little scary from some of them.

The morning buffet is full of carbohydrates and it would be very nice if they would bring out some Freshly prepared eggs, but they will make them for you upon request, IF YOU ASK! Other wise you'll be looking at breads of all sorts and some cured meats and cheeses for your morning meal.

Also nice to note is that the AC is very good... You can actually get the rooms ""cold"" if you like it that way.

All in all, not a bad place to stay. More training needs to take place with staff to help make the ratings go up with this facility.",5,2015,07,10
13,A boutique hotel with great location and all the Marriott customer services,"We stayed twice in this incredibly beautiful boutique hotel in May.  Beautiful rooms--you won't know this is your dad's Marriott--great service, excellent prices and a charming garden dining terrace-garden as well as central location.",5,2015,07,08
13,Excellent,"From arrival to departure service was impeccable. The architecture is stunning, being first a private home then the seat of the Association of Cotton House Manufacturers, perfect art deco. Food is amazing and don't miss breakfast: the array of pastries was like from a fairy tale. Really, really great job!",5,2015,07,08
13,Beautiful hotel but lacking in service,"This is a spanking new hotel with beautiful decor and stately furnishings, the rooms are not big but tastefully designed with refined taste.  We were checked in by 6 attendants, one knows what he was doing and the rest of 5 were hotel school interns learning the trade.  The hotel looks young and energetic due to the employment of youthful staff and interns, however this translates into inconsistent service, lackluster professionalism and occasional slips ups.  Particularly the house-keeping team needs a lot more training and consistency.  Toiletries were not replaced, towels missing, or old used towels placed back into the rack from the floor, and long brown hair stuck into freshly replaced towels. There is nothing worse drying your face then to have some stranger's hair in your face. I would have given a 3 stars if it were not for the nice interior and toiletries in the hotel.",4,2015,07,08
13,Charming and luxe boutique hotel,"Just came back from a four day stay in Barcelona and are very happy to recommend this recently opened hotel.

The décor is very special: exotic woods, rich leathers- offset by lush green foliage. The outdoor terrace dining room deck is romantic and the inside restaurant, among the best food we had! Definitely worth a Michelin star.

The service and friendly attitude of the staff makes it feel like a club- or home away from home. Our laptop wasn't working. The concierge asked us if we wanted to sign out an iPad or Mac (no charge unless not returned). Wifi included.

The  bedroom and bed is uber comfortable- and the freshly pressed fine white cotton sheets are gratefully appreciated with the addition of crisp air conditioning.(The heat wave across Barcelona made us appreciate good air conditioning!) Great for lounging,,,

Some guests might say that this is not a 5 star resort. It is not. The ARTS Hotel, on the beach, also a Marriott upscale property is. That said, it is an extraordinary 4.5 star boutique getaway and memorable experience.",5,2015,07,08
13,"Lovely hotel, great location","After a long Mediterranean vacation, the Cotton House was our last stop before traveling home. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was transfixed by the gorgeous architecture and impeccable furnishings in this historic beauty. To say that I was impressed would be an understatement; the service was superb, the breakfast was divine, and the room was clean and modern. We were given access to great wi-fi, treated well by all of the staff, and were able to relax in luxurious surroundings after a long trip. I will definitely be going back to the Cotton House next time I am in Barcelona, as it was by far one of the best experiences I had on my entire trip.",5,2015,07,08
13,"Really, Really wanted to give 5 stars, but...","First of all, this hotel is amazing, by far the nicest Autograph Collection I've stayed at.  For the size of the rooms, the space is utilized in a very attractive, yet functional manner.  Balcony room on the back was quiet and balcony space with 2 tables/chairs was inviting to my wife and I.  The bathroom design is broken up in a way that at first seemed less functional, but after spending a few nights, quickly came to the conclusion that this design is far superior to a traditional one.  A lot of U.S. based properties could learn a thing or two.  The staff is very attentive and always there at the right time to assist.

So, why not 5 stars?
First, the wifi in our room was one of the worst I have experienced in a few years.  Maybe I'm spoiled, but it was extremely slow and constantly kicked us off.  The only other property in Spain I have to compare was the Hotel Arts Barcelona which had great high speed wifi.
Second, the hotel has an outstanding library that is very comfortable except, for the music.  I think of a library as someplace you go to relax.  The music in the library is something I can only describe as ""dubstep"" mixed with some other high energy genre played at a less than relaxing volume.  I was not the only guest who sat down to leave shortly after commenting on the music.  Maybe I'm getting to old.

13,Cotton House Hotel Barcelona,For the discerning traveller who likes attention for detail this is not for you... On saying that lovely staff... Good location in the centre of town. New hotel and in my opinion they haven't got their act together as yet.To sum up trying to be 5 star when in reality they are only 4 star,1,2015,07,08
13,Nice Marriott Boutique Hotel,"Luxurious, refined, great location.  Small boutique-y hotel with gorgeous interior spaces. Updated flower arrangements daily.  (used same flowers in different vases- lovely)
  Staff couldn't do enough for you---HOWEVER: since it is a new hotel, they could not help much with local places (quick breakfast etc.)   The concierges were lovely and helpful with booking everything--but inconvenient if you didn't want to wait for one or go up one level to ask a simple question.
Several buses stop within a block making travel very easy. Main metro stop within a short walk..  Close to Las Ramblas--but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the crowds.  Great (Small) rooftop pool.  Amazing place for drinks/snacks on the 1st floor restaurant/outside garden area.
Very small gym (one stairmaster, one treadmill)
Went with my Father and sister, had a Egyptian suite room--pull out sofa was amazingly comfortable; but when left open, no room to walk in room. It was very easy to push back into place so worth having all of us in the same room.
LOVED the Nepresso machine in the room- nice touch and very convenient.
After a long day of touring, it was a really nice place to stay and would highly recommend.",5,2015,07,07
13,Fantastic ,What a wonderful find in barcelona. Truly a great boutique hotel. Staff wonderful. Always at your service. Great rooms.  Great restaurant. Buffet breakfast great. Every area of hotel very tasteful. Even the rooftop pool. So happy I chose this property.  ,5,2015,07,06
13,Full Of Amenities,This was our favorite hotel from our recent three city trip to Spain. The room was a bit on the small side BUT the bed was extraordinarily comfortable and the shower was fantastic. The 'continental' breakfast is simply fantastic and very extensive and we felt no need to order anything else. The staff was very helpful in orienting us to a new city. The decor of this newly opened hotel is unique and very interesting. Overall we had a fantastic stay !!,5,2015,07,05
13,Highly Recommend,"This is the first time that I ever reviewed a hotel on Trip Advisor.   I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Cotton House and I feel compelled to highly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking about a trip to Barcelona. The service was exceptional and the staff were all top notch.  When I return to Barcelona, I won't think twice about where to stay.  ",5,2015,07,02
13,"Not up to the e standard of 5 star, but an enjoyable stay","Would recommend this hotel due to front desk staff, and location!  Room and amenities is nice. However, it does not rate 5 star for the following reasons. 
Housekeeping was never consistent, one day shampoo, next day no bath gel, number of towels changed everyday, amenities like tooth brushes would appear then neve be replaced, light left on then sometime off, the worst being bottled water.  You're would think there is a crisis, max two small bottles.  As a couple we like tea and coffee in early morn, so done with water for the day, replacement was hit and miss.
Laundry was prompt return, that is a plus. However, breakfast buffet offered no hot food items. As Platinum, our breakfast included, but charged for a cooked egg.  Wifi ok, but in and out.  Overall, needs some improvement, and the total facility will keep this property from reaching 5 star, 4 star is max.  Good value, and keep expectations reasonable. Also we never received the upgraded room, although said possible later in the week.",3,2015,07,02
13,Downton Abby meets 2015,Great location amazing staff Alex at the bar is the best. Rooms are so clean and beds are like clouds. Very room is very grand visually. Pool over looks the city and is great for lap swimming. Right around the corner is tapa tapa which is great for a quick dinner.,5,2015,07,01
13,Convenient location but not of 5 star or Marriott quality,"We stayed at the Cotton House hotel for a family Mediterranean vacation.  Instead of staying at the scenic W hotel, we wanted to stay closer to the main attractions and shopping districts.  When we found the Cotton House hotel, even though it is a small boutique hotel we felt confident of its quality because of its association to the Marriott brand.   How unfortunately mistaken we were.  

Our overall experience is average.  First for the good part, it's location is great.  It is convenient located in the main part of town where the main attractions are - the Sagrada Familie, Casa Mila, the Gothic quarter etc.   We were to walk to shopping districts and there are many good restaurants nearby.  

The hotel facilities are not quite 5 star quality.  I would say that it is really a cross between a boutique hotel and a normal 4 star business hotel with clean and decent facilities.   The service and facilities are sub par comparing to what you expect at a 5 star hotels:
- Being a small hotel, configurations are limited and cannot be guaranteed.  We were given 2 rooms with King beds rather than the 1 King and 2 double beds configurations.  We are a family so it was not too bad I suppose. 
- toiletry kits are in paper box and not replenished after the box opened and used.  Maid just put the unused items back.  There were also no bath soap provided.  
- shower layout is unique as noted in other reviews.   The shower room while spacious contains the tub, the shower, and the towels - all in the same open area.  If you are not careful, you can get the towels wet. , The water basin area is in the bedroom so you need walk out of the shower room  to get to them. There are no locks in the shower room or the toilet.  The shower room door and the toilet room doors are both made of glass and covered with mat materials with hole patterns that are slightly see-through.
- the room phone is minimalistic, not like other clunky phones in other 5 hotels.  The only problem is that it is so minimalistic, I don't know how to dial to another room or what number to dial for the front desk.  
- I could not get the front desk to make change for just 100 Euros. 

All in all, the decorations of this hotel are unique and quite beautiful.  Location is excellent. The staff are polite and tried hard to please.  It is just that they are not quite the 5 star luxury hotel that they claim to be.",3,2015,06,30
13,Relaxing and Beautiful,"We stayed 1 night prior to flying home after a long Mediterranean vacation. We wish we could have stayed longer. This hotel is gorgeous and has all modern amenities that you could ask for (even American power converters to borrow). I'd highly recommend staying here. The staff at the front desk, outdoor bar and concierge were always going the extra step to ensure our comfort.",5,2015,06,30
13,5 star property part of the Marriott family,"Located between Passeig de Gracia and Tetuan  metro stops, this lovely boutique hotel (fewer than 100 rooms), which just opened in February 2015, offers exceptional service, large, well appointed rooms, a great bar for meetings or just having a drink and an extensive breakfast buffet in their outside terrace.   The hotel is in the former cotton exchange and retains most of the old building's architecture and design, but has been modernized to today's standards.    The roof top pool is quite small, but good enough for getting wet and cooling off.  Grab a bottle of wine to have on your balcony or next to the pool.

Having arrived without our luggage, the hotel, without our prompting, followed up with the airline for us and kept us updated throughout the day.  The minute our luggage finally arrived, they brought it promptly to our room as they knew we were anxious to get it.      One would never know that this hotel just opened--it runs like a well oiled machine, which is a sign of excellent management.",5,2015,06,28
13,Beautiful historic hotel in a perfect location!,We stayed at the Cotton House Hotel following a 12 day Mediterranean cruise on the VOS. This hotel is absolutely beautiful and walking distance to everything!  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  They offer a large outdoor seating area which was nice to enjoy some wine following our days of touring. The rooftop swimming pool was also lovely!  Would certainly stay again!,5,2015,06,28
13,Beautiful hotel in a gorgeous city,"The Cotton House is a new hotel in an old, beautiful building.  The building had historical value in that it was once the headquarters for the cotton trade in Barcelona. From the moment you walk in- you just feel like you are part of something. Everything about the property is lavish and luxurious. 

STAFF:  The staff was all very kind and professional. Although you can still sense that there is a 'newness' to their employment.  They provided us with a lovely tour when we arrived and explained the historical value and pointed out some wonderful things about the property. Since our room was not ready, they escorted us to the rooftop terrace for lunch. Speaking of the rooftop terrace.....

BATUAR:  Their rooftop terrace/bar/restaurant was quite lovely. The breakfast was included in our room rate so we enjoyed it every morning. Most of the staff spoke very good English. We enjoyed sangrias there one evening and dinner another. The food was superb. Staff professional.  You can just feel how important it was for you to enjoy yourself and truly enjoy your experience.

LOCATION: The property is in a neighborhood just off the crazy La Rambla. You will find a little peace but be just a 10 minute walk to the action. Many restaurants and bars in the area. Great views of the entire city.

ROOM: They put every attention to detail into their entire property. The room had luxurious cotton towels and sheets. It was heavenly. I did not care for the layout of the shower/toilet area as the shower door was quite heavy. But the shower itself was HUGE! The free wifi we had for being Marriott members made staying in touch with family easy.  The plunge pool on the roof was small but had amazing views. You could see the Sagrada Familia in the distance. 

It was a nice property that had a bit of a smugness to it. Very lovely but I could see where it might not be for everyone.",4,2015,06,28
13,There is NOTHING 5-star about this hotel,"There is NOTHING 5-star about this hotel

Paying a designer for expensive decor and furniture does not make your hotel 5-star. While beautiful to look at, my experience so far has been absolutely disappointing. A very late check-in after long flight delays was met with an offering of a glass of water at the reception. No fruit juice, champagne, or anything nice as all other 5-star hotels do. At the price, the rooms are ridiculously small. There isn't space to open two suitcases. There was no directory of services in English. So no way to know who to call for what, and the phone has no direct dial buttons and no list of extensions to call at the phone. The room lights are very hard to work out. The bathroom design is idiotic. Like a cheap airport hotel, the basin and mirror are in the bedroom. The cupboards sit astride the basin, and there isn't nearly enough hanging space. But worse, the shower and bath are in a combined sealed cabin, where the shower water splashes all over the bath, and using the shower wets the entire floor. So one shower and your partner has a fully wet bathroom floor for their next shower or bath. Also the door of the shower/bath cabin and the door of the toilet cubicle are sprung, and forcefully shut themselves on you if you don't hold them with some force. But worst of all is the service: No explanation of the hotel facilities at check-in. Our booking on Marriott.com had confirmed, with the words ""guaranteed"" that we would have feather pillows. There were none. A call to reception through very broken English revealed that they have no feather pillows, and that the housekeeping team was nowhere to be found as it was late so we would have to wait for tomorrow to ask. That is not 5-star service at all. Room service call in the morning was hardly understood, and although it hasn't arrived yet, I'm not sure I'll be getting what I ordered. I've also asked for a Directory of Services in English and have been waiting for 30 minutes for it to arrive. This is a painfully slow, uncaring and poorly trained hotel. Avoid it if you can.",3,2015,06,27
13,Summer Fun In Barcelona ,"Great weekend in Barcelona. All started with the Cotton House Hotel. Staff was friendly and very professional. Always ready with a Buenas Dias or a cheery Hola. 

The hotel and rooms were well appointed and tastefully decorated. The room was small but I did not come to Barcelona to stay in the room. However, the AC was strong and provided a beautifully cooled off room after hours in the Spanish sun. 

The breakfast buffet was a great start to each morning. Some tasty options. 

The hotel was located centrally and very close to public transportation and some Barcelona attractions. 

Highly recommend the Cotton House Hotel, ",5,2015,06,24
13,Long Weekend In Barca,"Spent a long weekend in Barcelona for the wife's birthday. Chose the Cotton House based on a friend's recommendation and the hotel's affiliation with Marriott Rewards. 

The Cotton House did not disappoint. The hotel was centrally located and a 2-3 block walk to major public transportation. Also, only a short walk to Las Ramblas and other major tourist areas. The staff was incredibly friendly and professional. Always a cheery Hola or Buenas Dias each time we passed. The breakfast each morning was outstanding with many truly high end options. Don't miss it. 

The hotel and rooms were wonderfully and tastefully appointed. The rooms might be a bit small for some, but I did not go to Barcelona to spend time in the room. The AC was as good as I have ever seen across Europe. Nice to cool off after long days in the Barcelona heat. Particularly for us Americans. 

I would highly recommend the Cotton House Hotel for your next stay in Barcelona. ",5,2015,06,24
13,Top Notch Hotel in Barcelona Near the Metro,"The hotel is tough to see from the street but once you walk in, you know that this is a luxury hotel.  It's a relatively new hotel and used to be a building which traded in cotton, hence the name, and the decor seeks to preserve that history.  Staff were very well trained and pleasant.  Rooms were very nice and modern.  We used Marriott points so I'm not sure about the rates.  They might be on the high side given it is a luxury hotel.  There is a tiny roof top pool.  If you get the breakfast buffet, they have an excellent assortment of cheeses, meats, fruits, pastries, quiches, sandwiches, macaroons, and more.  If you want eggs, you have to pay a little more but we didn't see the need given the variety of choices available.  The restaurant also has an outdoor patio to enjoy meals.  Concierge service was friendly and they were knowledgeable.  The hotel is mid-way between 2 stops on the metro, Placa de Catalyuna and Passeig de Gracia.  We thought the latter was a little easier to navigate but each is about a 10 minute walk, making it very easy to get around Barcelona via metro.  It was also very easy and cheap to take the Aerobus from the airport to Placa de Catalyuna and then walk a short way to the hotel.  Also, just a few doors down from the hotel is a small grocery store to stock up on water, snacks and wine so that was really convenient as well.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,06,24
13,Disappointed ,It is with regret that I had a poor experience in this hotel. I booked my room 2 months in advance through Marriott.  I am typically very happy and have never written a poor review:   The food in the restaurant is not very good. The rooms are very small and LOUD. The shower floods into the room and the window opened into a wall!,1,2015,06,23
13,Three glorious days in Barcelona,"From the moment we walked in the door we felt like we were being welcomed into an old friend's home. Our greeting was so warm and enthusiastic that we knew we had made the right choice! While the Cotton House is a Marriott property it feels much more like a small boutique hotel, which was exactly what we were looking for.
As we were celebrating our anniversary we were delighted to find a Happy Anniversary message written on the mirror of our room, and a bottle of wonderful Spanish red wine and chocolates waiting for us.
To a one, every staff member of this hotel made us feel completely welcome and assisted us with every need we had. 
We spent a good amount of time in the Gothic district which was a reasonable walk from the hotel...it is also close to the Ramblas for evening strolls.
I can't say enough about our experience here....except Thank You!",5,2015,06,23
13,Fantastic Hotel in Barcelona!,"I just spent five days at The Cotton House and couldn't be more pleased with everything.  The staff was so accommodating, whether it was to print out my many pages of work documents, make coffee concoctions specific to my likes or guide me in the right direction for an evening run.  The hotel pays attention to the details in design, service and overall atmosphere.  It's convenient to everything on top of it all.  Highly recommended!",5,2015,06,22
13,Cool hotel,This was such a great unique experience. The hotel is located within walking distance of the Gaudi district and all of the sites of the old city including the city cathedral. The hotel itself has a great design including a fun bar and restaurant. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are a good size.,5,2015,06,21
13,So strange,"The staff here are very kind and helpful. The accommodations are lacking though in a strange way. The shower Lis completely open to the bathroom and thus floods the whole area. So when only one person showers the whole bathroom can't be used because of the flooding. Management just shook their head and apologized and said all the rooms are like that.
The view out the window is of the side of the building next door. 
The walls are so thin you can hear any doorman the floor open and close! Beware ",2,2015,06,21
13,Outstanding Experience!!!,"I just returned from a business trip in Barcelona, where I stayed at The Cotton House Hotel with 6 other colleagues.  What an absolutely wonderful experience.

Even before our trip began the staff proved to be top rate - helping amend our reservations, recommending restaurants and activities and just being so responsive to any question we had.

Upon arrival we were greeted by Laura Alvarez, one of the hotel managers.  She gave us a tour of the hotel complete with stories of the property's historical importance as a residence and a cotton factory.  The place is absolutely stunning.  Each room more beautiful than the next - from the regal library to the bright bar area, world renowned interior designer Lazaro Rosa-Violan proves once again why he is Barcelona's best.

The rooms, each named for a type of cotton are well appointed and quite comfortable (especially the beds).  I was in an ""Egyptian Cotton"" room, with a beautiful terrace that overlooked the restaurant's patio below.

While the restaurant, Bataur, is not only beautiful inside and out, on the patio, the food and wine selection was really great.  We had the breakfast buffet each day - it had so much variety that no one ever got sick of it.  We also had many lunches, one dinner and countless coffees at Bataur.  Everyone just loved it.  I'd like to call out one of the servers from the evening shift, Nuri - she in particular was our favorite - accommodating and helpful with recommendations for exploring the city.

All in all we had a great stay and cannot wait to return back.  In addition to the staff I've already mentioned, I wanted to make sure to thank Alfredo Martinez, and most of all Anna Fuertes for such a terrific week at the hands down best hotel in Barcelona!",5,2015,06,19
13,The best choice,"If you want to be in the hart of Barcelona with walking distance to sight seeing and transportation this is the place, every employee does their best to help you, they even go out of their way. Marriott im glad this hotel is your family. ",5,2015,06,18
13,Stunning Hotel,We recently stayed at this hotel for three nights while visiting Barcelona. It is located in a prime location for walking to all major attractions. The hotel staff was extremely helpful answering any questions about getting to any place you would like to visit!! They have maps available and helped us use the rail system to get to a few places even circling the stops on the map for us! The Hotel itself is so lovely!! I love  to take photographs and every room I was thinking how amazing a photo shoot would be! Again the staff is great! We chose not to eat breakfast there and instead walked to the Ramblas Market and had fresh fruit in the morning for 1 Euro! We did go to the bar/restaurant for drinks and the staff there was so sweet! I loved the outdoor area for nightly cocktails it was wonderful! Cotton House was everything I expected it would be! Thanks to the fabulous staff for helping us navigate around Barcelona it was an amazing visit to an Amazing city!,5,2015,06,14
13,An Exceptional Experience - Once Again,"This is my second time at this hotel and the experience was exceptional. The staff could not have been nicer, from the front desk staff to the restaurant staff. All went way out of their way to take care of me and make me feel at home. This hotel is part of the Marriott Autograph collection and I can see why. It's a beautiful hotel with a lot of history. It's reasonably close (walking distance about 8 blocks) to Las Ramblas and La Placa Catalonia. This time I stayed in one of their suites and entering it was a jaw dropping moment. It was huge and absolutely gorgeous. My only regret is that my wife couldn't join me on this trip. She would have loved it. Everyone has different tastes that's for sure, but I would say it would be hard to be disappointed at this hotel. I will definitely be back, next time with my wife.",5,2015,06,14
13,Minor improvements needed but overall excellent ,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location. Everything one would expect from a five star accommodation -- very luxurious. Points for improvement :

1-- while we were by the pool,
Someone tried to bring beer and water up from the bar. After making the trip down the elevator himself to bring back the drinks, ten minutes later, a waiter appeared to say he could not have glass by the pool and had to leave or take the drinks to the room. This is absurd. It was easily 85 degrees on the pool deck. There should first be waitstaff checking in on people to see if anything is needed from the bar or restaurant and second there must be drinks allowed. Try plastic cups!!! I was shocked at this whole occurrence we witnessed and although a flaw it can be so easily fixed. Also access to ice machine on that floor would be a good addition. 

2- had dinner at the restaurant which will be a separate review for that place specifically but the waitstaff there - although very polite and pleasant - was clearly new and learning. I anticipate with time the speed and degree of attentiveness improves. Although - I am from the U.S. and know that sometimes In Spain things are a bit more laid back so that could be it.

13,9 nights in Heaven!,"This Hotel is SPECIAL! Great historic building, completely renovated, modern, and clean. Incredibly friendly staff. Fabulous patio and great location. Everything about this hotel is first class. If you are a Marriott Rewards member you can even get/use points since the hotel is a member of the Autograph Collection of Hotels. It is a wonderful boutique hotel.",5,2015,06,12
13,First class!,I just left Spain yesterday and already miss The Cotton House. The hotel is beautiful and has first class service! The little touches of water and desserts upon arrival were wonderful! Great job to the staff and concierge. It was also centrally located to everything. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again.,5,2015,06,10
13,Nice but....,"We stayed one night at the Cotton House the hotel was in a good location and the staff was friendly. Our room was a bit small which is to be expected in Europe, the bed was very comfortable, there was a separate shower and toilet and a desk. 
Our issue with the hotel was we had a train to catch at 8am, we had asked for a 6am wake-up call, which would give us lots of time to get ready, have breakfast and take the metro to the main train station, well we never got the wake-up call. We somehow woke up at 7:15am, jumped in our clothes, no breakfast, forgot our adapter in the room because we were rushing so much and had to take a taxi to the train station. So in conclusion as a travel agent I would probably not sell this hotel to my clients, it ended costing us about 100 euros that morning between the taxi, adaptor and having to buy breakfast. I would probably try another hotel next time.",3,2015,06,10
13,Perfection Found,"From the moment we walked in, the service provided from this hotel is impeccable. You get the feeling when you step inside the lobby you have been transported to another time. The common rooms are beautifully appointed combined with both old and new furnishings. The decor is lovely.
We were extremely impressed with the staff throughout. Claudia at the front desk was outstanding in welcoming us each day and even delivered our luggage herself to our room so we would not have to wait upon our arrival. Her sincere warmth was greatly appreciated. Reyes provided excellent service in greeting guests and parking our car. Alex was very helpful in giving us city information as well as the concierge. The patio breakfast and bar staff were also great. No one missed an opportunity to take care of us.
We loved everything about our room. The beds are very comfy and the sitting balcony is a great plus. Plenty of room storage and I appreciated the bath/shower combo with a flat surface for showering.
If you can afford to stay at this hotel, highly recommend it. You will not regret it!",5,2015,06,10
13,"Beautifully renovated historic building, exceptional staff, perfect location","We stayed at the Cotton House Hotel for 6 nights in Egyptian Room #508.  I sent an email to the hotel shortly after it had opened asking for a picture of the exterior of the hotel as all of the pictures on the website at that time were only of the interior.  I immediately received an email from the Gossypium Manager, Alfredo Martinez, who emailed me a beautiful picture of both the front and the back of the hotel with a very nice/personal email saying he was looking forward to welcoming us to the hotel.  The pictures on the website do not do this hotel justice--it's MUCH more beautiful in real and we could not have been more pleased with our stay.  The renovation of this historic building is truly stunning.  Plus the perfect central location can not be beat--very easy to walk to most of the sights you want to visit--we even walked to Park Guell, but that was quite a hike, although well worth it.  Everyone on the staff goes out of their way to help you with any questions you may have as well as making suggestions for places to see.  The concierge, Rachel, was EXTREMELY helpful and patient with our long list of questions.  Be sure you ask the concierge to take you on the “historical tour” of the hotel—very interesting and worthwhile.  The breakfast buffet has SO much food that we had a hard time each morning deciding what to eat--it was all delicious.  The hotel is elegant without feeling fussy.  All of the public rooms are very cozy and beautifully decorated--it truly feels like you are staying in a lovely mansion of some very wealthy friends--you do not get the feeling you are in a hotel.  I realize everyone has their own experiences and opinions of a hotel when staying there, but I HONESTLY do not understand how anyone could rate this property as anything less than excellent.  We HIGHLY recommend this hotel for numerous reasons and we will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,10
13,"Loved this hotel, except for a couple things","We stayed 5 nights in a Cotton Room with balcony.  I loved the hotel with a couple exceptions, so let's start with the good.  Compact room but well organized.  Adequate closet space, drawers for clothes, the safe in a drawer easily accessed, great storage space at the vanity, a bench to unload your suitcases, and a wonderful balcony with 2 comfy chairs and 2 tables (the end rooms looked like the balconies might be smaller than the non-end rooms).  The balcony looked over the courtyard, which was lovely.  The breakfast buffet was fabulous--cheeses, hams, salamis, bread, fresh fruit & juices, yogurt, pastries, etc.  You could order eggs for only an additional 5 euros, which I though reasonable.  The staff, especially Sergei at the front desk, were generally great.

Ok, here's my quibbles.  Despite the website saying this is a smoke-free property, smoking is permitted on the room balconies, which we discovered when our neighbor lit up our last night.  I understand accommodating smokers in the courtyard, where non-smokers can move away, but it should not be permitted on the room balconies.  Also the website says complimentary water.  We learned at checkout that means the one bottle provided at evening turndown service, not the bottles in the mini-bar.  The website should be corrected to clarify this.  The balcony door does not have a handle on the outside, so if you close it completely, it's a struggle to get it open again.  The shower is a complete room, which is fine, except the hooks for the robes are behind the shower room door.  So to hang up the robe after showering, you have to step inside the shower room and get your feet wet all over again.

The breakfast staff were generally pretty good, but we ate dinner at the hotel our last night and the service was very disorganized.

The location is fabulous.  We walked everywhere except to Park Guell.  All my quibbles aside, I would highly recommend this hotel and stay there if I ever visit Barcelona again.",4,2015,06,09
13,Unique boutique with the elegance if a grande hotel.,Stunning renovation of a historic building.  Reverence to the history mixed with fine contmeprary artworks.  Ultra modern facilities.

13,"Gorgeous hotel, great location","We enjoyed the historic nature of the building & contemporary details! Loved the terrace/bar area. Good size room & bathroom. Great decor, very courteous staff. Were able to walk to many sight.  We spent 3 nights for our honeymoon in Spain",5,2015,06,07
13,A truly great stay,"This recently opened property has it all-great central location, very helpful multilingual staff, & unique design/ ambience. Nice breakfast buffet as well (with made to order items available). Will absolutely revisit on return to Barcelona",5,2015,06,06
13,"Beautiful property, great service!","The Cotton House Hotel is located close to the shopping district and to several key attractions.  The property is absolutely gorgeous with an old world feel but clean, crisp contemporary rooms. Elegant, beautiful, and thoroughly rich with its cotton house history, the property is only topped by the friendly and service oriented staff.",5,2015,06,06
13,Perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect. ,I can't say enough.  Staff wonderful.  Decor beautiful.  Breakfast Perfect.  Lunch worthy of a last meal.  Barcelona was always a favorite destination... but Cotton House feels like a second home.  A second home... with a perfect staff!  They exceed all expectations!!!,5,2015,06,06
13,Beyond expectations,"This was the end of our amazing trip and what a delight and unexpected surprise to stay at this beautiful hotel. We were told when we checked in that it had only been opened 3 months.  The staff was so very professional, friendly and service orientated it was hard to believe the hotel was only opened 3 months.  Everywhere you looked in this hotel you found something so maginificent to feast your eyes on, truly a beautiful showplace. So much attention to detail was paid to decorating The Cotton House Hotel .The back patio to have a bite to eat or a drink was wonderful. The breakfast room, food and service were delightful. The Cotton House is located in a great area within walking distance to all.  This was beyond our expectations and we do hope to be able to get back to Barcelona and the Cotton House in the near future.",5,2015,06,05
13,Lovely,"We stayed at the Cotton House for one night and wished we could have stayed longer. The staff is very attentive and helpful, especially at the front desk and in the restaurant and concierge area. The rooms are fabulous; beds comfortable and nicely appointed. Our rooms had balconies with shutters, giving them a bit of privacy and a view out to the courtyard. The hotel is in a great location, on Gran Via and near great shopping. I would stay here again in a minute.",5,2015,06,05
13,Family Vacation,We traveled with two children to Barcelona and had a great stay at the Cotton House. When we arrived our room did not have a tub so they quickly moved us to a room that did. The bed was super comfy and we loved drinking wine on our balcony every night. There are several grocery stores within walking distance. It's a beautiful hotel. They have a rooftop pool they looked nice too. It was too cold when we were there!,5,2015,06,04
13,Amazing hotel!,"This is a world class hotel.  We spent the last 6 nights of our honeymoon at the Cotton House hotel and had an amazing stay.  The service was amazing, the staff was really helpful (Rachel in the concierge was awesome!), and the bar/terrace was beautiful.  Rooms were perfect and the beds were so comparable that we didn't want to wake up.  The shower was great too!  I wouldn't hesitate about staying at this hotel.  Location couldn't have been better.  All the beauty of a old school classic hotel with all the amenities of a modern property.",5,2015,06,04
13,Brilliant stay in Barcelona,"The staff and hotel were outstanding. Booked for two nights and the hotel is clean, new and unique . It features some really nice sitting areas like the library on second floor and the rear patio dining area. The breakfast buffet was the best I had during my one week holiday in Europe . Location is quiet yet close to attractions and dining options . We had good assistance from the concierge to book tickets, travel and dining. Very nice boutique hotel.",5,2015,06,03
13,Fabulous!,"I had no idea where to stay in Barcelona for a long weekend and picked the Cotton House Hotel off the Marriot website.  What a fabulous decision!!  It provides the perfect balance between the amenities of a large hotel and the warm and comfort of a small inn.  The first floor provides small rooms with comfortable chairs you can relax and read a book, a large table where the concierges will give you personal care and help with anything you need, a small restaurant with the best food that I had in Barcelona (including Cal Pep), and a sprawling deck with benches piled with cushions which make it the perfect place for a drink after walking through Barcelona all day. The architecture in the hotel is amazing, I particularly liked the spiral staircase.  Rooms were very comfortable with excellent linens and appointments, and we had a small patio through a large door which was perfect for a relaxing nightcap.  

All of this was great, but the hotel staff was what made the trip truly special.  From the front desk staff to the barkeeps and waitstaff to the concierge, everyone was superb!  They were friendly but professional, attentive to every need, and helpful beyond belief.  Overall, the best service I've probably every had in 30+ years of global travel.

Finally, I want to comment on the chef.  I have forgotten his name (after I went out of my way to ask the staff!!), but every single thing I ordered and ate was top class -- beautiful presentations and amazing flavors.  I am going back to Barcelona for work in October and I will go out of my way to eat at the Cotton House Hotel.

I strongly recommend the hotel for anyone who wants a fantastic stay in Barcelona.  Many thanks to everyone at the Hotel for helping make a long weekend with my wife truly memorable!",5,2015,06,03
13,Excellent Boutique Hotel in best location,The rooms are very modern and comfortable and the space is ample considering it's a hotel in a European capitol city.  The service was fantastic from the front desk to the concierge.  This is our go to hotel for a week visit to Barcelona.,5,2015,06,03
13,Watch out for the shower!,"A lovely renovated old building, well situated in downtown Barcelona, only recently opened. Very friendly and helpful staff. BUT, my wife fell in the shower the first night. The wet floor was like an ice rink,  without any non-skid strips. And no grab bars!  When I questioned the stupidity of slippery floors in a shower, I was told that the owners wanted the property kept like the interior designers had made it. This was evident from other problems. Our west facing room on the front of the property had only a cotton shear on the window. No light blocking drapes, so forget any chance of an afternoon siesta without sun streaming in (although the rear east facing rooms had shutters). This attitude about pleasing the decorators rather than the guests extended to the sleek modern phones. Absolutely no instructions on the phone itself or on a card about how to use it. I had to go down to Reception to ask how to call them (it's dial 3000 - why didn't I know that!). And don't get me started on the terribly slow dinner service. A reservation for 8pm, and we were still getting entrees served at 10pm, and I finished mine before the rest of our party got theIrs. All in all, Marriott needs to send in experts who are not in love with the aesthetics of the place and more attuned to customer service.",3,2015,06,01
13,Beautiful place,"Very nice place.  It is new so it looked great.  Loved the cotton accents everywhere.  The room was clean, fresh and the bedding was traditional Marriott nothing less than super comfortable.

The entire place was very clean. The staff was very professional and helpful.  A bit stiff but professional.

Had a great stay in Barcelona.  I would stay at the Cotton House again anytime.",5,2015,05,31
13,Beautiful,"This is  a beautiful hotel in barcelona... Wonderful and convenient  location  near best stores for great shopping too. Very elegant property with a sophisticated vibe in a neighborhood that's convenient to everything .
You'll love this hotel",5,2015,05,31
13,Cotton House Marriott,"This hotel was beautiful and the staff was very nice.  But our room was the courtyard, while beautiful in an authentic sort of way, we were awoken early in the morning by a dog!  Most likely trying to get its owners attention to let it in, but it took more than half an hour for the dog to stop barking.  The noises from this residential courtyard can be loud and obnoxious, I would not recommend staying here if you can only get a courtyard room. 
For the price I expected more noise control. ",3,2015,05,31
13,Wonderful stay. Will return! ," I stayed at Cotton House for 3 nights on Holiday with my 22 year old daughter.  Cotton house provided some of the best service that I have had. Because of my Marriott gold status I was upgraded to a balcony room which was very nice. The room was bright and beautifully decorated and very clean. Very comfortable. At night there was a bottle of water left on the nightstand by the bed with 2 glasses. The ""continental breakfast"" was fabulous. There was so much to choose from and everything was so fresh and delicious. We were taken such great care of here and were grateful for it. All of the staff was wonderful. 
 A pleasant surprise was the pool on the top floor. What a view. I didn't realize there was a pool on this property. I didn't get to use it but I did enjoy the deck. 
 Lastly, you can't beat this location if you are going to be exploring all of Barcelona's amazing sites. Everything was in walking distance and if you need a taxi the taxi site is right on the corner 1/2 a block from the front door of the Cotton House. We were a pretty much a 10-20 minute walk from everything except Park Quell which we opted to take a taxi to. 

Also, if you are looking to save on transportation and don't have a lot of baggage you can take the airport shuttle for under $6 PP from the Placa du Cataluna which is an easy 10 minute walk. 

Overall this was a wonderful experience and we will return upon our trip back a lovely city. ",5,2015,05,29
13,Beautiful new hotel in a great location,"We loved everything about our stay at the Cotton House Hotel.  It only opened a few months ago, so the rooms  still felt brand-new.  The decor is modern and upscale. The rooms are small, but it's typical for what you'd expect in the middle of a European city. The location is great - definitely walking distance to restaurants, museums, parks, landmarks, etc.  The staff were friendly and helpful, and check in/check out were simple and fast. There's a small pool and patio area on the roof, and there is also a very small fitness center as well - it only has one treadmill and one elliptical trainer, though, so if you're planning to work out while you're there, you may have to wait.  
Also, the wi-fi was pretty fast, which was a nice perk.",5,2015,05,29
13,Incredible stay,"My wife and I stayed for three nights at the Cotton House earlier this month. We wish we would have stayed there for our entire trip. Incredible property with even more incredible staff. You can tell that this isn't just a job for them, they show great investment in your happiness and experience. I imagine some of that comes from being apart of the founding staff for the hotel. Whatever the reason, they are great. Plus, the hotel itself is gorgeous. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and we liked the location. It's an easy walk to the touristy areas, but it's just enough outside the chaos that you feel like you have a calm place to retreat to at night.",5,2015,05,29
13,VERY BAD!!!!,"Sincerely I was expecting such a beautiful experience and an amazing hotel. I always travel reading reviews. I was expecting an oasy...
The result: My room was a 18sqm mini room, new and nice decor but very cheap material. Service was very weard.... Many people running and no one attending. they were simply not focusing in any of the guest. My wife wanted to leave... The last little thing that let me decide to put this classification, was the very poor cleaning in my rooms. More than once I have found hairs in my bed and in the shower. SImply BAD!!!",1,2015,05,29
13,best of the best,"What can I say...everything at this hotel is top notch.  If only every hotel were like this one...From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted with the friendliest of staff.  There was complimentary tiramisu in the lobby at all times.  The hotel itself is a work of art and located in an ideal part of Barcelona--walking distance to the most important sites in the city, including the old Gothic part of the city, the modernista buildings and the Sagrada Familia.  The room was splendid, quiet and private.  The continental breakfast was one of the most extensive I have ever seen in a hotel, including everything from a plethora of the typical breads and cereals to quiches, a desert table and exotic fruits.  I will definitely come back to this hotel when I return to Barcelona.",5,2015,05,28
13,Wonderful Experience!,"My daughter and I were impressed with our one night stay at Marriott's  Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona, Spain prior to our 7 day Western Caribbean cruise.  After a lengthy flight from Atlanta, GA and my daughter's luggage being left in Paris, France,  we were greeted by a friendly, and vibrant staff who offered us chocolate truffle cake as a welcome!   

Although unable to tour Barcelona due to time constraints, the hotel is located on a lovely boulevard short distances to many of Barcelona's attractions.   We enjoyed 
Dinner and breakfast in the outside patio.  Service was exceptional and the revocations to this old cotton warehouse were works of art.  Most important, the beds were extremely comfortable and balcony inviting to weary travelers!   

I would enjoy more time to explore Barcelona if returning again and will, definitely choose the Cotton House Hotel again.   The friendliness of the staff and taxi cab driver in Barcelona were appreciated during a time of stress when trying to find lost luggage.",5,2015,05,28
13,End of our trip.,We were done with our Cruise and needed a one nighter - wishing after staying there for one night that it would have been for more nights.  What a cozy and relaxing hotel.  We are definitely going back there.,5,2015,05,27
13,"Lovely, hotel, lovely staff!","My husband and I stayed here for a week while in Barcelona. The hotel is a former private residence completely restored to its former glory. They have a roof top pool and large 2nd floor resturant and patio. What is truly a standout are all of the staff, every single person has been a delight to deal with. From this location both the Ramblas area and the Sangrada are a short walk. Love this hotel!!",5,2015,05,27
13,New hotel,"We stayed in Barcelona for 5 days, a family of 6. We had quite a good stay at the hotel, although you could feel they were novices.
The hotel is quite small but very welcoming.
The terrace on 1st very nice, but could be upgraded ( decor and ambiance).
The rooms are nice(ask for walk in closet).
The service is slow and not consistent.
I would like to thank Kevin, from reception, and Marta from the bar.
Location is very good, and once the service improves, could be a great hotel.",4,2015,05,27
13,"Sooo relaxing, I want to return","Location, luxury, wonderful young, enthusiastic staff.  The library for rainy days, the terrace for sun and a wonderful restaurant.  I preferred their tapas to any other eaten in Barcelona.  Usually I love to explore and use hotels only as a place to sleep.  I was so comfortable at the Cotton House, I had to force myself out.",5,2015,05,26
13,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights last week - lovely, friendly helpful staff.  Great location and very smart room.  Didn't try the restaurant as we wanted to sample the restaurants and bars of Barcelona.  Would highly recommend.",5,2015,05,26
13,Lifetime experience I won't forget!,"While I have never ever wrote a recommendation on a hotel......I felt I needed to share an incredible experience my wife and I won't forget! Alfredo Martinez and his staff were absolutely on top of their game and the hotel was just beautiful. Great history, spotless throughout, great meals and service out of this world. If you ever want to see how you do it right, visit this location and thigreat city. I hope the ownership recognizes Alfredo and his team ( especially Zamil and Ivana)for their dedication and commitment to their guests! Thank you",5,2015,05,25
13,Great service and good location but small rooms,"Overall the level of service from staff is what you would expect from a quality five star hotel.  The hotel is very new and combines classic with modern looks.  The rooms are a little on the small size, but this is usually the case throughout Europe.  It is more of a boutique hotel and allows for more personalized service.

You go to this hotel for two primary reasons, the service and the location.  Only five minute walk from the city center and personalized service equivalent to a Ritz Carlton.

Free WiFi.

For Marriott elite level members they also have a very nice ""continental breakfast.""

They have a roof top pool, but it is more of a lap pool than anything and it is not heated.  Overall a great hotel and would go back again.",5,2015,05,25
13,Gracous Hosts,"We arrived at 9:00 in the morning from the Wind Surf yacht and didn't expect our rooms to be ready. Instead, we got a tour of the magnificent hotel by the most gracious staff and had coffee in the glorious resorted library where they volunteered to set up their wi-fi link on all of our devices (free wi-fi at the hotel). We were there for two days and couldn't have been more pleased with our accommodations and reception. We travel a lot and this was wonderful. Highly recommended.",5,2015,05,24
13,Terrific experience,"Spectacular hotel, nicely appointed, the staff were very friendly, professional, and helpful. The decor is fresh, clean, and tasteful. Beds were comfortable and baths were clean. The only drawback that we experienced was that our room had a shared door with an adjoining room and the sound mitigation between the two was not the best. We could hear others in the other room walking, coughing, TV... We paid €150/night (last-minute booking) and felt it was a bargain. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,05,24
13,High expectations,"We were very excited of having booked this hotel as per their site and pictures really put our expectations high for a nice stay and some pampering at the Cotton House.
Upon arrival (we were driving our car) the hotel made no effort on helping us with our luggage or helping us to park in front of the hotel just for a few minutes for a quick check-in... we were four of us and all reception employees saw how we were quick dealing with our suitcases without bothering to offer some help... only until I went to the reception and surprisingly the receptionist ask... ""are you staying with us"" (why would we arrive there with our suitcases without the intention of staying there?)... only upon my confirmation that we had a reservation he offered to help with the suitcases and by then we were almost done... what a disappointment of service for such property.
The room had nice amenities and decor but very small. pool at the rooftop is a nice touch but no employees goes there to check if anything needs to be cleaned or organized - again not 5 stars.
They feel very proud of their property as they offer a tour throughout their hotel to show the heritage features of the property but their service doesn't meet the expectations or the building.",3,2015,05,24
13,Oasis in the lively city,"We stayed in the hotel for three nights in May 2015.
The good experience starts as we got to the reception desk for checking in. The utterly nice and knowledgeable team greeted us with fresh water on a hot day, with premium chocolates and with a fast and smooth check in. We were surprised with an upgrade to a cotton house room, although never asked for an upgrade. Then we got to the room - wow! Beautifully decorated, a balcony, full of light and totally quiet (how do they do it?). The shower and sleeping experiences deserve their own sections. The shower and the bath are separated, so no one should risk stepping and standing in a bath for taking a shower (we are shower people). The shower head is huge with unlimited immediate hot water at any time of the day or night. Premium toiletry with the strong wide stream were wonderful. Then, we got out and met the soft, thick huge towels and a wardrobe that sent us next day to the desk to ask whether we can buy it. Next, we went out to the wonderful lively city and returned exhausted to find the best part of this room – the bed and linens. A bed that hugs you and linens that are crisp and soft and silky and making you realize why this hotel is called the ‘Cotton House’. 
We preferred to take our breakfasts outside to live the city, but after looking at the breakfast porch (I’ll try to upload a picture), I’m not sure we made the right decision as it looks like one more great experience in this hotel.",5,2015,05,24
13,Exceeded our expectations!,"The hotel is beautiful, in every detail and in a wonderful location. We were so impressed by the staff's energy and kindness.  Everyone was so sincere in wanting to accommodate us and make sure our trip was special. We look forward to returning and celebrating our anniversary again here.",5,2015,05,23
13,All around great stay!,"If the beautifully restored reception doesn't blow you away, walk up the grand stairway to the even more incredibly restored spaces on the next level. The staff couldn't have been nicer and seemed to enjoy the hotel as much as we did. We spent several evenings having Cotton Fashions (their take on an Old Fashioned) and enjoying the Library space. You can't go wrong with this property; friendly and informative staff, beautiful common spaces and well designed guest-rooms.",5,2015,05,23
13,Outstanding Experience,"We have had a great experience at this hotel with exceptional service from the entire staff.  They make you feel wanted and take care of your needs.
The buffet breakfast is good but different than US breakfasts with mores cheeses and veggies.  Great assortment of juices and the coffee is wonderful as is the service.  
The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of most of the sights.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,05,23
13,Brand new and a true gem,"We are big Marriott people so when this opened in March, 2015 and we knew we were coming to Barcelona we were fortunate to get a room.  It has been sold out every night of our 3 night stay.  It's very convenient to the Gothic area which is really where you want to be.  Marriott has outdone themselves with the restoration of this cotton baron's house.  They actually removed the old wood floorings in the public areas and then reinstalled them.  The place is magical.  The morning buffet is outstanding.  I can't say enough about the staff.... so accomodating and genuinely nice.",5,2015,05,23
13,what a shamel!!!,"I need to admit that we left pretty upset from this hotel because they have never tried to change the situation and acknowledge our problems.
we have stayed 3 nights over the weekend, slow check in, ok thats not a problem. MINI MINI MINI rooms, our rooms and my sons rooms were of a maximum 15sqm, i couldnt move. I had the luggage in the top of my bed because there was not enough space. we have been asking for a large room and you only need to pay was the answer. The  A/C was not working properly..... They hyave a good restaurant but you want also to go and have dinner outside, no sign of a concierge.... !!! I will never come back and i definitely dont suggest to people travelling with 2 luggage per pax.",1,2015,05,21
13,Enjoyed our stay,"We recently stayed for 4 nights.  Overall this is a wonderful property and highly recommended to anyone.

Location:  Excellent and within walking distance to all the must see and do's in Barcelona.

Hotel:  An old building that retains is charm but offers all the modern amenities that a new property does.  Nice pool on the top floor.  Great patio in the courtyard out back for drinks/food.  The property is truly amazing.  The common areas, especially.

Rooms:  Completely redone in a contemporary feel.  Most have balconies.  Beds are SUPER comfortable.  Nice desk space.  The ""Egyptian"" rooms are on the ends and provide a bit more space, but the patio is a bit smaller.

Staff: We ran into a few hiccups but the front office manager got involved and took care of our needs.

Platinum Care: We received a room upgrade and free continental breakfast.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to stay again.",4,2015,05,20
13,Amazing Hotel and Experience,"My mom and sister and I stayed at this hotel for 4 days and it was not long enough. The hotel itself is a renovated mansion dating back to the 1800s. It managed to keep all of its charm without sacrificing anything on the modern conveniences. It is absolutely beautiful. The staff are extremely nice, helpful and friendly and the breakfast spread is outstanding. We had to force ourselves to leave the hotel after breakfast because the patio and food were so pleasant. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go because the location was so convenient. I cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2015,05,20
13,Such an amazing Hotel!,"We stayed at the Cotton House Hotel in Barcelona in early April.  The hotel is gorgeous! Very clean, new, great location, and beautifully decorated. While the rooms are not large, the high ceilings, and amazing shower definitely make up for it.  The entire staff was more than accommodating; they made our stay unforgettable.  They remembered our names, got us taxis when we needed, made restaurant reservations, and even had an Easter egg hunt for the children in the hotel. It truly was a fabulous experience.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,05,20
13,"Lovely hotel,  lovely staff. ","We enjoyed five nights in an upgraded room (Marriott status), the king bed was amazingly huge and comfortable and the bathroom had a great big rainshower, as well as a tub. It was quiet,  and the staff are all young and eager to please. Breakfast was a buffet with many items,  I'm not sure how any could complain. My husband wanted an omelette with bacon and that was an additional five euro charge. Highly recommend, and well located we thought.  ",5,2015,05,19
13,Brand new hotel with old world charm in great location,"The Cotton House Hotel is a new hotel in a renovated older building. The rooms are small but on a whole big for Europe especially for older charming hotels.  The combination of new rooms and renovated common spaces with grand marble staircase and orginal library makes for a great mix of modern bathrooms you can fit in and old world charming spaces. The hotal has a up scale resturant with peaceful outdoor eating area and a small rooftop pool, which was a nice feature for a quick dip after hot days walking around Barcelona before going out for the evening.  The location of the hotel is ideal close to the gothic area and La Rambla and Placa Catalunya (deffintely do the hop on and hop off bus tour from here).",5,2015,05,19
13,Save the best for last!,"Barcelona was the last leg of our 3-week EU vacation and we could not be happier with our hotel choice! We knew that it was going to be an awesome place, being a member of Marriott's Autograph Collection, but we were blown away by how beautiful this hotel was! The interiors were handsomely decorated, our room had a great bed and a huge bathroom with complete amenities and the hotel had this gorgeous terrace which was perfect for having drinks just before turning on for the night. The bar had a great wine selection at reasonable prices so we were able to enjoy a few bottles without feeling too guilty. The staff was warm, helpful and knowledgeable in each of their areas of expertise. The hotel's location was quite central and we were able to walk to several Barcelona sights. Then we took the metro to get to attractions that were further away. Cannot recommend Cotton House enough for anyone looking for a classy place to stay at in Barcelona!",5,2015,05,19
13,Beautiful classic hotel and wonderful staff,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Cotton House.  This is a Beautiful classic hotel with a wonderful staff.  
This is one of the Marriott collection hotels.  The lobby, common areas and rooms are all nicely decorated.
The restaurant is very nice.  The restaurant connects to an open air courtyard.  The waite staff is very friendly.
The Cotton House is a nice section of town.
I would come back here in a heart beat.",5,2015,05,19
13,Superb Marriott Addition,"We booked this hotel, not knowing it was recently opened: our taxi driver at the airport had never heard of it. 
It is well-positioned, very close to but just far enough away from the tourist bustle to be a peaceful oasis. The staff were unfailingly helpful, discreet & courteous. 
The reception lobby can be a little ""busy"" at times but there was still a very calm feel to the place. 
The decor is stunning, especially on the 1st floor and adjacent to the foyer is a bar / coffee area where breakfast is served. One has the option of sitting inside or on a lovely outdoor terrace: a firm favourite for afternoon cafe con leche after a day out. 
Our only minor quibble: our favourite Martiotts e.g. Lisbon & Nashville, have had fantastic ""omelette stations"" for breakfast. The need to purchase egg dishes separately is a slight irritation. 
However, overall, a superb, elegant & classy hotel. Thank you. ",5,2015,05,19
13,*****5 Stars*****,"Hotel Cotton House is like a throwback to the Golden Age where art, luxury, service and attention to detail were paramount. From the front desk to the housekeeping staff HCH, provided a flawless experience. Most remarkable was the service from the attendants who run the morning breakfast buffet (HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BREAKFAST PACKAGE). Stayed in room 401 in the Egyptian Cotton tier, room had a small balcony that overlooked the courtyard, got great sunlight and was sufficient in size. This hotel is not to be overlooked. Perfect location, great value, excellent food, flawless decor, IMPECCABLE STAFF, again, FIVE STARS.",5,2015,05,17
13,Wonderful experienxe,"We had only one night in Barcelona following our transatlantic cruise.  This property is a true gem.  From the truly personal exchanges via email making arrangements, to the warm welcome, a beautifully appointed room, and an incredible brunch this hotel is not to be missed.  Very moderately priced for the location and quality.  Wonderful indoor/outdoor restaurant with fine service.  Will be back!!!",5,2015,05,16
13,Fabulous stay,"My husband and I are celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary at the Cotton House right now. The service has been impeccable. We are enjoying a lovely bottle of wine on the terrace and the staff here have been amazing! It is the same level of service we are used to at the Ritz Carlton.

They have an interesting program here where they have hospitality service interns are working at the hotel for a few months. One stands out. Her name is Avantika. She will be a superstar in the business.

The room and food are top notch and we are in a great location for exploring this wonderful city. Muy bueno!",5,2015,05,16
13,Amazing!,"This hotel has only been open a little over two months. It is n a beautiful area with a residential feel, but only a few blocks from major attractions.  The staff are well trained and anxious to please. The roof top pool has phenomenal views of the city.  The terrace of the restaurant is beautifully furnished and welcoming, whether for breakfast or cocktails.  The concierge was most helpful with recommendations for activities and dinner reservations. Our only disappointment was that the Hotel Directory of Services was not yet available in English.",5,2015,05,15
13,A definite do over!,"A stunningly beautiful hotel with an interesting history and a location at the heart of everything that you'll want to see. A very friendly and helpful staff made it feel like our home away from home. The concierge was also knowledgable, and made excellent recommendations on local attractions and restaurants - and booked our reservations while we waited.",5,2015,05,15
13,"Third time in Barcelona, best hotel by far","This hotel is perfect in every way, from the warm greeting from the front desk staff to the well appointed room. This was my third time in Barcelona, and third hotel, and definitely my favourite. It has a warm, boutique feeling, beautiful public areas where you can have a drink in the library or the tailor's room. The room itself was lovely, not huge, but adequate, the sink and dressing area were in the room, with a wet room with a great rainfall shower and bath, and separate room for toilet. 

Location was handy, 15 minute walk to the main shopping area and 15 minute walk to the Sagrada Familia.

Next trip to Barcelona, I will definitely stay here again.",5,2015,05,14
13,"Absolutely fantastic, first class hotel","Went for the Barcelona Grand Prix , a fantastic hotel , the hotel staff are brilliant they couldn't do enough for you, I have never stopped in a hotel like this in my life and will return again soon. 
The breakfast is amazing",5,2015,05,12
13,Fabulous stay in Barcelona,Stayed at the Cotton House for two nights - a great first visit to Barcelona. Hotel staff extremely eager to please and helpful. Atmosphere is very nice and unique. Great outdoor restaurant and bar which is very comfortable. All in all a great stay! ,5,2015,05,08
13,Cocktails are amazing,"Honestly have never visited hotel's rooms just a restaurant and bar. Have been there couple of times and every time telling my self that not the last one my visit. Good attention , great food, amazing terrace.",5,2015,05,08
13,Lovely. ,"Terrific new hotel. The staff was outstanding. The hotel is beautiful. Rooms are very nice, with great lighting and decor, although the shower floor is slippery. Breakfast is good but very expensive. The terrace is delightful. I would go back in a minute. ",5,2015,05,08
13,Luxurious historic hotel in a great location,"Entering the lobby of this hotel is like stepping back in time to colonialism.
The cotton theme is clearly present in the lobby as well as in the room as you can see from my pictures.
I had a COTTON King room with a lovely balcony and my very own Nespresso machine. It was quiet and comfortable.
The pool looked awesome as did the bar terrace, however I did not have time to enjoy them as my stay was short.
The hotel is perfectly located within minutes of Plaza Catalunya and the Ramblas.",5,2015,05,04
13,MARVELOUS LONG WEEKEND,Just 1 word: FABULOUS!!!! We' ve stayed in this FANTASTIC hotel for a long weekend to celebrate the birthday of my Mom and it was just MAGNIFICENT!! Thank you for the great service & hospitality!! We' ll be back very soon!,5,2015,05,04
13,Great Hotel,"I highly recommend the Cotton House.  We spent a week here in early April.  The hotel is new and in a great location.  The staff clearly wants the hotel to succeed and goes out of its way to help.  The service was excellent.

We didn't just sleep at the hotel.  We spent quality time here.  The breakfasts were first class.  There is a huge, well-decorated terrace attached to the restaurant/bar, which allowed us to eat or have drinks outside.  There is an outdoor lap pool on the top floor. From the pool, we had a good view of Sagrada Familia and Tibidabo, as well as the other rooftop restaurants and gardens.  The pool had several chairs which allowed us to lay outside, and either read or catch a few rays and a few z’s.

One feature that I really appreciated was that the pool area and the terrace had a lot of outlets, so it was easy to charge my cell phone and laptop when I was there.

We stayed in a Cotton Room.  It was a good size, with a bathtub, shower and outdoor balcony that was big enough for two people sitting in the two chairs we had and two others standing.  The pocket doors in the room essentially separated the bathroom and the bedroom if one wanted more privacy.",5,2015,05,03
13,VERY NICE PLACE,"Cotton house is a new and very nice hotel. 1st class service. very good location, few blocs from Casa Batlo (Gaudi). Also close to the train station where you get a train to the airport. The coton theme is very good presented in the decoration of the hotel.",5,2015,05,01
13,Impeccable! ,"I'm pretty sure had I sneezed someone would have been right there with a tissue. From the moment we walked in the service was outstanding. The hotel is gorgeous, and has a beautiful deck and restaurant as well. Our room was outstanding and well-appointed with a large walk-in shower that was more like its own room.  It is in a good area away from the craziness of La Rambla, but still within walking distance. ",5,2015,04,29
13,My husband had a meeting at the Forum.,"We enjoyed our stay tremendously at the Cotton House Hotel. We loved the history of textile industry that once flourished here. Sumptuous breakfast was served in a beautiful sunlit room facing the lovely courtyard. The library has many beautiful old paintings of Rajas perhaps from the British Raj. The concierge and staff were so friendly and helpful and guided us thru the Ramblas, music hall and the Picasso museum. We have left with wonderful memories of Barcelona!!!

13,Going beyond,"Prime location, clean rooms, comfortable beds,… nothing extraordinary for a 5star hotel, right? The Cotton House offered me, however, much more of its valuable attributes which I would love to share. The one night stay in this colonial style boutique hotel was a surprise for my Mom visiting me in Barcelona. The design of the hotel is very unique and its story is very connected with cotton what you can see in every detail. She could not believe it until she was given a warm welcome by the Front Desk, followed by a personal tour explaining the story of a former Cotton Foundation. Another sweet welcome with a handwritten note was waiting for us in our bed. The room itself was very well equipped, had really comfortable bed and huge soft towels. All the materials used and the design, even the smell is aligned with cotton story which makes this hotel one of a kind. The lights in the evening let us enjoy a glass of local wine and a cozy atmosphere of the stunning library accompanied by very friendly personnel. Excellent late breakfast was just perfect for the mother-daughter talk while enjoying the variety of high quality food. With many little extra touches and outstanding staff going beyond their call of duty, the Cotton House exceeded my expectations and fulfilled my unexpected wishes.
 Thank you all for being a part of the special time I could spend with my Mom in your place.",5,2015,04,23
13,Service experience was outstanding,"First off the property location is excellent. A boutique property only opened 3 months ago.  Walking distance to many of the great neighborhoods and attractions.  What really impressed us was the enthusiasm of the staff. Many were interns still studying at University but if they lacked experience, they more than made up for it with their energy and effort to make our stay a truly unique experience. This is a property with a very interesting history and we were offered a tour when checking it. It was absolutely fascinating. For the next five days, the staff performed in every area of the hotel from the bar and restaurant to the concierge to the front desk and housekeeping. We truly enjoyed ourselves above and beyond our expectations.",5,2015,04,22
13,Fantastic room in a beautiful city,"The hotel is set on a gorgeous tree-lined street and we lucked into an amazing suite on the second floor with a view of the road. (The oversized windows/doors to a small balcony are insanely well made; you cannot hear a single sound from the street.) The sheets are silky smooth. The ceiling is probably 20-feet high (no exaggeration) and dates from the 1870s. The bath has a decadent soaking tub that should not be missed. The room has a Nespresso machine. Unlike a Keurig which makes the poorest excuse of a coffee I can imagine, a Nespresso makes a beautiful espresso with a rich crema on top. What a nice way to fight through my jet lag!

We're eating breakfast in the hotel restaurant tomorrow. I typically avoid hotel food like the plague, but breakfast is included with our room. We went to check it out and, seriously, what a lovely place! There's an enormous terrace, a beautiful bar, and plenty of cozy places to sit for a drink. The continental breakfast is actually an enormous spread, and I can't wait to indulge.  

The staff speaks English quite well and they're exceedingly helpful. I would absolutely stay here again.",5,2015,04,21
13,Best Weekend of our Lives. Amazing Hotel & Amazing Service,"I booked this hotel as I was travelling to Barcelona to propose to my girlfriend. I wanted a unique location to propose to her in and I was delighted when I found the Cotton House Hotel.
I contacted the hotel to explain that I planned to propose during our stay and I was put in contact with a manager called Alfredo. He answered a number of emails from me with a genuine willingness to help me to make this special moment in our lives extra special. 
On arrival we were upgraded to the most amazing suite - the Damasco Suite.
I have stayed in nice hotels and nice rooms but nothing like this. It was so amazing and the perfect location so soon after we arrived, I got down on one knee and proposed to my girlfriend. 
Shortly afterwards, I received a call from Alfredo to check was everything to our taste and soon after that we received complimentary champagne and chocolates to our room. The staff were so so nice and did everything to make sure our stay was truly incredible. They all have a lovely approachable but understated manner. The hotel itself is really beautiful and has so many unique features. It is the perfect mix of the old and the new. It is a clean modern hotel but we woke each morning to a view of a ceiling from 1876 and we imagined people looking at the same ceiling over 100 years ago.
We had an amazing weekend in Barcelona that we will remember forever but it really was made all the more perfect by choosing The Cotton House Hotel. I cannot thank all of the staff in the hotel enough especially Alfredo.
We will definitely be back to Barcelona and there is only one hotel we will be staying in.
Richie & Aisling",5,2015,04,21
13,BEST OF THE BEST,"I am very strict with my hotels and I have to say that if TripAdvisor had 6 or 7 stars i would have given them all to this hotel and mainly to its staff. the whole experience is just out of this world. before you even visit the hotel you start to have a feeling of what will come. starting with Ms Mondejar (reservations manager) and Mr. Alfredo Martinez (Gossypium Manager) who were more than helpful, friendly and spent more than 3 emails each to help me out. A special thank you to both of them Ms Mondejar helped me all the way to the booking and the upgrade that i had asked for and Mr Alfredo just did everything else in order for our stay to be perfect. we were celebrating our one year anniverasry and they had a bottle of wine, flowers and a special note waiting for us in the room prior to our arrival. except that all the recommendations for dinner were right on the spot. also the reception and the bar staff were not just helpful and friendly but went out of their way just to please us. the hotel as a hotel...the building is beautiful, the beds are amazing and the grounds are luxurious. you can see the pictures. the area where the hotel is, is perfect for a traveler. just 3 minutes away from the metro and 5minutes away from ramblas on foot. lots lots of nice restaurants and bars in the area and everything seem to be right by the corner. I highly recommend this hotel even if you have to pay a bit more than the rest of the hotels in the city. it does worth every single penny. I suggest that you book directly through the hotel as their people are the most helpful that you will ever meet. A room in the back is recommended as you can see the backyard which is more than relaxing and gives you a feeling of getaway from the busy city.",5,2015,04,20
13,A magnificent stay in a wonderful city,"Let me start by saying my expectations were exceeded. That staff are superb in fact one of the best I have experienced- so thank you. We had a room on the top floor with the most incredible view. The roof top pool was perfect, cozy sun loungers over looking the city and you can see many of the cities historic buildings as you sip a nice cold drink in the sun. The attention to detail is fab and I enjoyed exploring the different lounges, rooms, bar, and terrace that was been so lovingly restored. I love the ottoman period and my favourite room was the ottoman library room where you can relax and read, work or have a drink. They have really maintained the historic beauty of the building. Breakfast is again fantastic, fresh juices with a twist I liked the mango and coconut. Many Spanish cheeses, meats , pastry etc. organic yogurts and a tasty selection of hot food also- and the waiters and waitresses are incredible at looking after you. The location it self is perfect and I highly recommend walking to all the attractions from there and not getting a taxi or bus as the surrounding streets are beautiful and packed with things to see. We had a great night sleep and in keeping with named we enjoyed all the incredible quality cotton linen, towels etc probably some of the best quality I have seen in a city hotel. I highly recommend.",5,2015,04,20
13,"Comfortable, welcoming experience in a big city","We booked this hotel through Marriott Rewards points. We knew the property was new, but we thought we would give it a try. We were very happy.

When we arrived in Barcelona, we were at the end of a 17 hour journey from Los Angeles. We fell asleep almost as soon as we got settled in our room. We woke up for a room service dinner (which was outstanding) and then slept in again until breakfast the next morning. We were quite comfortable.

We were in a Panama room, which is in the interior, and it was what we needed. 

The staff were all very nice and helpful. I noticed that most of the guests were a bit more upscale than my wife and I, but we were all treated the same way. That was what impressed me the most.",5,2015,04,19
13,Beautiful room and lobby,"I highly recommend this hotel.  We had a very comfortable room and bed.  Incredibly helpful and friendly staff.  Beautiful common areas, including breakfast room.  Location convenient to metro and Gothic Quarter.",5,2015,04,18
13,The Best sleeping expirience. A very pleasent place to stay,"This was my first visit to Barcelona. And allready I know I will return to this hotel.
The hotel is located in a very nice and fully restored building it is obvious that the management did not save any effort and insisted on all the small details...
The staff are very proffesinal and freindly. The consiarge was very helpfull recomending very nice eating places...
The entier team was freindly...
the schef is very talanted...
to summerize this is a very nice five star boutik hotel. That gives you an individual expirience...

But the most remembered point is the fine bed  cotton... the best and most comfortable  I have ever tried....",5,2015,04,18
13,The Place To Be,"Two (hundred) steps from Plaça Catalunya, the location is perfect for both pleasure and business. Authentic building, elegant rooms.I hope the nice fabrics they used will withstand the rigors of hotel life. Very friendly staff. Big terrace inside a typical Eixample block, lappool and small gym. Rich breakfastbuffet. Good all-day dining. Nice public areas.",5,2015,04,17
13,Disappointed ,"Just arrived in This hotel today for 2 nights. 
First time in this hotel. 
The room is very small and noisy, on the boulevard. 
Also the bathroom inside the room itself (not separated). 
Nice personnel. 
I am very disappointed. 
No spa and a very small pool. ",2,2015,04,15
13,Over rated,"I just arrive at the hotel today. 
I'm here for five days. The room is very small and very noisy. The bathroom is not disconnected from the room. The hotel is nice and clean, the staff look very professional but for the price I think it's over rated. ",3,2015,04,15
13,The highlight of our trip!,"There are not enough wonderful things to say about our experience at The Cotton House Hotel! An exceptional boutique hotel with the perfect combination of personality and elegance. We arrived to the hotel after almost 24 hours of traveling, a cancelled flight and an arrival without bags, yet from the moment we walked in, our stay was magnificent. 

The hotels decor is perfectly appointed and each space has an individualist charm with picturesque traits. The lobby sets the tone for the feel of the rest of the hotel. We stayed in an Egyptian Cotton Suite, which was a great layout of a room with an oversized closet and lovely bathroom area. The bed and pillows were to die for; best sleep we have had in a while.

We dinned in the restaurant for breakfast; which was superb and looked forward to returning every afternoon for a glass of wine on the hotel's terrace. The food was all fantastic and the service staff was lovely at each encounter. 

The staff of the hotel were some of the best; yet there are two in particular that really were the highlight of our stay. We were greeted by Ruben and Alex of the front desk and their smiles and welcoming attitudes immediately helped us feel at home. From check in to check out they took such wonderful care for us. Alex made us a list of recommendations for Mallorca; which was the next leg of our vacation and had it waiting for us upon check out. Above and beyond, to say the least! Ruben's passion and knowledge for his city were absolutely contagious. He took it upon himself to be our personalized concierge recommending places to see, things to do, and must catch restaurants to dine at. He took us on a tour of the hotel, as well as, of our room, to share with us the buildings history and indigenous features. I wish every hotel we stayed at had a Ruben on hand. He really was an incredible ambassador for the property and for the city of Barcelona! Our trip would not have been the same without him. 

I am not typically a traveler that likes to visit the same places twice but I look forward to rebooking a trip to Barcelona and staying at The Cotton House Hotel again very soon!! Thank you for an incredible visit!",5,2015,04,15
13,Great hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. We had a nice balcony overlooking the restaurant. In a good location, close to the gothic quarter and within a walking distance to water (10-15min) and sagrada (20min). Would stay here again. ",5,2015,04,14
13,Great room and decor in brand-new hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights and loved every minute. The whole hotel is brand new, the room was immaculate, and the bed was incredible comfortable. The hotel itself is very beautifully and tastefully done, and meals and drinks were a treat in the art noveau-ish library and bar. Location is also great - walking distance to a host of the classic sights. Service was very friendly and helpful as well.

We did not use the spa or workout facilities, so can't comment on those, but everything we did see and use could not have been of higher quality or better-appointed.",5,2015,04,13
13,Thank you so much! It was an amazing & wonderful stay!,"We made a reservation for one night. But the hotel was comfortable and inspiring, staffs are kind and always very helpful we extended our stay for 2 more nights. They make sure we don't need to change our rooms and we have a wonderful stay for 3 nights. The library is a must visit area, so cozy and helps me to concentrate while I needed to have some work done. 

Thank you so much for the hospitality during our stay!",5,2015,04,12
13,Outstanding Hotel,"This historic Hotel, previously the HQ of Cotton Traders, was not only lovely, but one of the best Hotels I've ever stayed in. The Staff was first class and treated the Clients with respect, always asking if there was anything we needed. The staff were always smiling and friendly. Waitress Claudia, was adorable and went out of her way to make you happy. The Hotel had an outstanding breakfast buffet . The rooms were richly decorated, beautiful, and very clean. The beds had top grade Egyptian cotton linens with a comfortable memory foam mattress topper.  It was actually the most comfortable Hotel bed I've ever slept in. A 5 Star Hotel in every way, in the heart of Barcelona. Fantastic!",5,2015,04,10
13,Phenomenal world class luxury hotel with a home feel,"The Cotton House is exceptional in all respects.  The building, the decor, the staff, the culinary quality and the interesting classic cocktails - simply a great hotel!  The most impressive of all is the unbelievably wonderful, friendly staff - the hospitality that we received was outstanding - the hotel from top to bottom is amazing.  All the more amazing is that the hotel is brand new, but the quality of service exceeds any that we have experienced.  This is unquestionably the best hotel that we have stayed in ever in all of Europe!",5,2015,04,10
13,One of the best,"Beautiful boutique hotel showing the original decor with modern amenities, comfortable beds with Egyptian cotton fine linens, excellent staff, wonderful breakfast buffet indoor rooms with fantastic decor or outdoor on the sunny terrace. Service was really wonderful. to be recommended for an amazing stay in the heart of Barcelona!!!",5,2015,04,07
13,Birthday visit to Barcelona with my sweetheart,The Cotton house is a great boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona. the hotel is in a classic older building but the upgrades and renovations are very nice. The staff was super. Everyone I came into contact with were super friendly and helpful from the front desk to the concierge to the bar and restaurant. The breakfasts were awesome. I would recommend this hotel for a getaway or for business due to the location. The wifi was very good by the way. A great hotel with weak wifi can be very frustrating especially on business.I recommend Barcelona and this hotel.,5,2015,04,07
13,"Great Hotel, Fantastic Friendly Staff, superb location","Great recently renovated (mid Feb 2015) boutique hotel; was previously HQ of Cotton Traders - so steeped in History and very well renovated, retaining the majority of original features. We were here for the Easter Weekend celebrating our Wedding Anniversary and were upgraded to a balcony room and had a plate of small fancies and wine in our room on arrival. Hotel is spotless and staff were very friendly and attentive - whilst not being too attentive ! They had a sign in reception saying they were in 'Beta' - if that was Beta - then I cant imagine how fantastic it will be when out of Beta !",5,2015,04,07
13,Excellent stay,"We stayed for 4 nights over the easter weekend, and it was a very enjoyable experience.

Bedroom:
Nice bathroom / wet room
Bed - softest and potentially biggest bed I have ever slept in
Lovely little balcony overlooking the terrace

Service:
Excellent breakfast (selection of pastries, smoked salmon, bread, fresh juices etc and we ate every day out on the terrace in the sun. Staff very attentive yet discreet.
They even booked tickets for us which was helpful (sagrada familia etc) to avoid the queues - gracias Albert!

Rooftop: Lovely pool (non heated) refreshing for a quick dip after a long day of sight seeing.",5,2015,04,07
13,Slight disappointment,"We booked this room through an online travel site as part of a package. The hotel is relatively new and centrally located and the common areas are gorgeous which is why we picked this place to stay. No complaints about the service or the common areas, but I was disappointed in the room experience. The hotel is advertised as 5-stars which, based on my experience, seems a little inflated. We probably got the least desirable room in the hotel but even such a room in a 5-star hotel should have some minimal level of amenities. The room was not that large but I think many hotel rooms in Barcelona tend to the smaller size. Our room did not have a bathtub, no wired internet access, no drying rack in the bathroom and no real full-length closet space to speak of (there was maybe 6-10 inches of width space by recollection). We stayed at two other hotels during our visit, a  4-star and a 4.5-star and both had better room amenities than the Cotton. Location was decent, a few blocks from Placa de Catalunya. The fitness room looked like a converted walk-in closet and the pool was quite small. The sauna is actually located in another hotel down the street. I think I would have been more positive in the overall experience if my expectations were not raised given the 5-star rating.",3,2015,04,07
13,Perfect boutique hotel in a great location!,"From the photos on their website we had high expectations regarding the Cotton House. Having stayed there for 3 nights we must say that the hotel definitely exceeded those expectations. The Cotton House is in a beautifully restored old building and the architects did a superb job creating one of the most luxurious and impressive hotels we have ever stayed at. We stayed at a ""Cotton Room"" which had a nice balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. Each member of the staff we met was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Breakfast was one of the best we had in a 5-star hotel. Since they have a huge outdoor terrace we were able to have breakfast outside in the morning sun.
For our next stay in Barcelona the Cotton House will definitely be our first choice again.",5,2015,04,07
13,Beautiful new hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights, and found it as we were familiar with the Autograph Collection of hotels from Marriott.  This is a wonderful, boutique hotel where no detail is overlooked.  The hotel itself is beautiful, and in a very convient location.  Close to the train, but easy for walking, shopping, restaurants, La Ramblas, etc. The hotel bar/restaurant is very nice, and the staff is friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had all we needed. The views from the pool deck are quite special.  The courtyard lounge is a wonderful place to have breakfast or relax.  The rooms are very comfortable with a pretty fabulous shower with nice bath products.  The staff was very nice, and the concierge was so helpful.  He spoke perfect English, and recommended some great restaurants and ideas for outings.  Would definitely recommned!",5,2015,04,06

The building is absolutely beautiful with all original old features inclusive the original floor and the antique statue of the former residents family. They even provide a service to produce an original tailored cotton shirt. 
The staff is more than friendly, they are all extremly helpful and happy. 
Highly recommended!!",5,2015,04,01

13,Fabulous new boutique hotel right in the center,This hotel is just a month old and still smells of paint in some places but they really did a fabulous job! The room even though wasn't the largest had a really clever layout so you really don't feel cramped. The decor feels colonial with lots of dark wood. Even the finishing feels luxurious which is often not the case in new hotels. The staff is very kind with a respectuous but not stiff approach. The service feels honest not forced. I had a view on the inside courtyard which really is typical Spanish and it was deadly quiet at night. I love this hotel couldn t fault it.,5,2015,03,28
13,Beautiful building small rooms,"We stayed in this new hotel for 3 nights.
The building is absolutely beautiful with all original features.
Location is perfect, right in the center unlike for example W hotel.
Rooms are a bit small and as the hotel is new they were still doing some small works at some places.
Would recommend if you don't want a 40m2 room or so",4,2015,03,28
13,Great Visit!,"Stayed for one night and had a great stay.  Our room was very nice, tastefully decorated, large room, view of Sagrada Familia.  Nice bath/shower room.  The bed was very comfortable. The employees were wonderful, you could tell they wanted you to have a great stay.  The breakfast was very good, great variety.  Warm food dishes were extra, but they had plenty of items without the warm dishes.  They allowed you to make your own tomato bread....so simple but so good!  Would definitely recommend this hotel, wish we could have stayed longer.",5,2015,03,25
13,Perfect!,"We had a wonderful stay at the Cotton House! We arrived after a long day of travel and were welcomed by perfect employees and a beautiful boutique hotel.  
From the moment we checked in it was evident that the entire staff had been trained perfectly and were there for the customer.  They were always helpful and would seek information from others if they did not have the answer.  They were pleasant, discrete and overall the best hotel employees we have ever encountered.  
Our room was the Cotton Room and was perfect for our stay.  The shower/tub room was beautiful.  The bed was definitely the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in abroad.  
We had great food at the restaurant Batuar and drinks at the bar.  
Thank you to the entire staff at the Cotton House for such a great experience in Barcelona.  We can't wait to return!",5,2015,03,23
13,a pearl in the heart of Barcelona,"Cotton House is the dreaming boutique hotel. Everything is beautiful, charming, chic and cosy. I just love how the place and its history has been respected. It makes this hotel very special. Our room was amazing, spacious, intimate with very high ceiling and no noise at all, despite the busy Gran via. The restaurant is a a stunning room, getting a beautiful natural light in the morning. We look forward to come back and try the terrace.The breakfast is just delicious. The service and staff are efficient, friendly, discrete. The location is perfect. All in all it was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in recent times.",5,2015,03,16
13,Very good expérience at Cotton House,"We stayed 4 days at the hotel and every day has been an even better expérience.
Service is really full. People are really dedicated to give the best experience at any time.
Breakfast is really complete and with quality products.
I recommand this place anytime.

13,This may be the best hotel I've ever visited,"We are staying at this hotel only a week after its opening, and I can not think of one thing they should do differently.  The service and staff are spectacular...warm, friendly and attentive.  The hotel is BEAUTIFUL!!!!   It has all of the luxuries of a large hotel, with all of the personal touches of a boutique hotel.  It is so beautiful, I'd come back to Barcelona and just stay at the hotel and never leave.  Also, PERFECT location, centrally located near shopping, restaurants and sightseeing.  BUT....you won't want to leave the hotel!",5,2015,03,09
13,Amazing new hotel,"We checked in on the first day they opened, stayed for a week and enjoyed every minute of it. We had a reservation at another (very) highly rated Barcelona hotel but after one night there, decided we didn't like it nearly as much and hurried back to the warmth and comfort of the Cotton House. The rooms and common spaces are lovely and welcoming. The staff is beyond thoughtful and available at a moment's notice. I truly can't think of a better hotel experience and can't wait to get back to Barcelona, and the Cotton House Hotel.",5,2015,03,07
13,Total Gem on ALL Levels!,"This hotel just opened but you would swear it had been open for years by the excellent level of service. 

The rooms are airy and comfy and you feel like you are in someone's home versus a hotel. 

The dining areas/bar are very cool in their classic old school yet modern way. 

And the breakfast each morning is filled with lots of local and homemade treats. 

Be sure to also check out the new restaurant complex nearby called El Nacional ",5,2015,03,06
13,Spectacular!!,"It was the best experience of our trips in Europe. Stayed 10 days at Cotton House. The hotel is wonderful, an architectural gem with very unique details, and historic.  Spectacular rooms, very comfortable, and very elegant, with many details to make you feel at home. The most spectacular thing has been the attention... the friendliness, the professionalism and warmth of its staff. From Reception Susan and Lotte, always very friendly and smiling attentive to every detail. In restaurant because EVERYONE.. the whole team has made us feel at home, always pleasing us and remembering details to make us feel at home. Especially Ferran.. the best coffee and service in all of Spain will be prepared by Ferran.. ! Kings in reception attentive to every detail, and very friendly and smiling with every detail. Thank you to the Cotton House family for havingr of our spectacular vacation! We'll be back.  Ka location is unique.. recommend going to MERCAT behind the hotel one block.. it eats very well!",5,2024,09,12
13,A truly international experience,"Customer service is excellent. We were very surprised by the internationality of the employees. The rooms are comfortable, equipped with everything one could need. We will recommend it to all our friends and family who wish to visit Barcelona. Mr. Reyes was especially helpful and informative. Thank you all very much.",5,2024,08,25
13,Diagonals Hotel,"A pleasure to enjoy in this hotel, mixing the old with the millennium, making this place recommended yes or yes, very good location, warm attention, a glass of champagne at the reception, and the impeccable hotel service, at your disposal 24 hours a day",5,2024,02,02
13,I advise!,"Very friendly staff, perfect location, right in the center. The rooms are a little small, but still everything is very well looked after. The bar / restaurant is very welcoming and has a pleasant terrace. I advise!",5,2023,11,16
13,Coffee and zombies,"The aesthetics of all the rooms are superb, great atmosphere. I spend five euros for a coffee and a zombie puts the cup on the table for me and goes away, I call him for the sugar, the zombie comes back lolling, he puts it on the table for me like you put a bunch of keys and goes away, I call him for at least a paper napkin, ditto, and finally for the now international glass of water but here the zombie speaks, says that it is not expected, and brings me a closed bottle.... I glance at the restaurant area and see unmistakable expressions of Americans faced with their burger being too raw. In short, without criticizing the staff too much, I would say that this historic and beautiful place deserves a new Manager.
Thank you.",1,2023,11,04

13,Excelente servicio ,"Excelente servicio en general, pero quiero agradecer principalmente la atención de Reyes muchas gracias por la amabilidad desde la llegada hasta la partida… el desayuno bueno sino y servicio del bar también muy bueno",5,2023,03,26
13,"Luces y sombras, muchas sombras...","Llegué a las 11 de la mañana, me registré y como la habitación no estaba preparada, me fui. Me dijeron que me llamarían cuando estuviera lista; ni me llamaron ni me enviaron la notificación a la App de Marriott. Soy miembro del programa de fidelidad. 
A las 3 de la tarde volví a por la llave, había 2 parejas haciendo el check in y me tocó esperar. De paso digo que la recepción es muy pequeña y entre la gente que se acumula y los carros de maletas, no es nada cómodo. En ese momento el mismo empleado, de nombre Reyes, que me había guardado la maleta me preguntó si era un repartidor que venía a dejar un paquete  
Me pareció una falta de tacto absoluto, porque en ese momento ofrecían cava o champage a los clientes que estaban delante mío. No pretendo que me inviten una copa de nada, pero lo mínimo siendo un hotel de esta categoría es que los empleados sean respetuosos
con los clientes y Reyes no lo fue.
Al check out me habían cargado un mini bar que no había cosumido, lo digo y me lo quitan, cuando veo la factura me lo habían cobrado igualmente. Me tocó volver y explicarlo para que me hicieran el abonó  correspondiente. 
De las 3 chicas que había en recepción,
2 no hablan español, también muy sorprendente. 
Antes de dejar la habitación me llaman a la puerta, era una joven empleada del hotel, que tampoco hablaba español, y quería controlar el consumo del minibar; ¿que iba a controlar si ya me lo habían querido cobrar?
El hotel es muy bonito, las zonas comunes son espectaculares, la habitación pequeña pero bien equipada, el baño no es nada cómodo. Sales de la ducha directamente a la habitación y lo mismo del WC.
En fin un gran hotel pero con personal que no está a la altura.",3,2022,10,27
13,Reyes nos atendió como reyes!!,"El Hotel es muy bonito! Habitaciones impecables y el personal muy amable
El Sr. Reyes bell boy nos sorprendió con su diligencia para todo!! El coche!! El taxi!! Las maletas!! El peso !! Sorprendente la calidad de servicio del sr Reyes!! El restaurant riquísimo",5,2022,05,13
13,Excelente hotel con una ubicación magnífica pero con un servicio muy mejorable.,"Las instalaciones son excepcionales con un diseño muy acogedor, estilo su decorador Lázaro Violan, pero el servicio es bastante irregular, no acorde a la categoría de este hotel. Hay bastantes personas poco profesionales, incluso en la propia recepción.",4,2022,05,04
13,Reyes nos dio una experiencia magnifica.,"Tuvimos la estancia más fantástica que jamás hubiéramos podido imaginar. El hotel es, por supuesto, divino, pero el personal y el nivel de servicio fueron extraordinarios. Desde los agentes de recepción que nos recibieron calurosamente y enviaron una botella de vino para nuestra estancia. El personal del restaurante fue muy amable. Pero realmente no podría haber tenido una mejor experiencia si no fuera por el portero, Reyes. Una joya de persona. Cada vez que interactuábamos me llenaba de inspiración y conocimiento.",5,2022,02,16
13,Cena en familia para celebracion ideal,"Magnigico restaurante para celebracion especial , vinimos en familia para el aniversario de mi hija.

Servicio impecable, muy buen confort a pesar del ser en Enero, buena comida, tanto entrantes, platos y postres de la carta. Estufas muy recomendables, en ningún momento pasamos frío.",5,2022,01,15
13,Brunch espectacular,"Estuvimos ayer sábado haciendo el brunch en la terraza del hotel. 
Adjudicarle el adjetivo espectacular al brunch es quedarse corto. Empezamos con unos huevos Benedict con tartar de gamba, roastbeef de jabalí, hummus de remolacha, tartar de ciervo… se me hace la boca agua de recordarlo. Seguimos con mollete de calamar encebollado, briox de liebre, la tortilla de erizo de mar y caviar… de verdad que hay que ir para comprobar lo rico que está todo y el cuidado del chef a la hora de adaptar el brunch a la temporada, ahora mismo con especial de caza. Y para rematar, torrija de crema catalana y carrot cake: ‘la mejor guinda del pastel’. 
Servicio muy cuidado, personal atento y delicado. 
El espacio ideal: terraza, sol, estufas para dar calorcito.
Nos faltó reservar habitación para echarnos a descansar, todo lo demás Perfecto. Recomendable al 200%",5,2021,12,05
13,Increíble,"Ningún comentario negativo. 
Las instalaciones y el servicio es excelente. 
Desde que hice la reservación pedí ayuda para rentar un auto, directo en el hotel lo hicieron por mí, fue un proceso fácil y agradable. 
Las habitaciones son muy lindas, muy cómodas, se antoja estar ahí. 
La decoración es espectacular.",5,2021,12,01
13,Me encanta,"Lugar precioso donde solo entramos para tomar un cóctel y disfrutar de la magnífica decoración y ambiente de lujo que ofrece este hotel.
Un sitio sin duda donde será todo una experiencia poder algún día disfrutar del servicio y de la majestuosidad y el ambiente vintage que describe el hotel",5,2021,11,29
13,"Precioso hotel, servicio mejorable",El hotel muy mono pero el servicio no es de un hotel 5 estrellas. Tarda el room service para subir un edredón suplementario a las 11 de la noche tarda 20 minutos. La habitación para 3 solo preparada para 2. No nos traen un plato en el restaurante pero lo incluyen en la cuenta. El desayuno aparte lo cobran diez minutos antes de cerrar pero te piden que cojas lo necesario en 5 minutos porque cierran.   El agua sale de repente o caliente o fría. Y la habitación francamente pequeña. Muy decepcionante,2,2021,10,19
13,Muy buena experiencia,"Muy recomendado. Excelente atención del personal en recepción, restaurante y botones. Muy serviciales. Reyes increíble el botones
La primera habitación tenía un mal olor pero nos hicieron upgrade y nos pasaron a una muy bonita mirando a Gran Via. Buen desayuno y muy buen nivel en la gastronomía del restaurante",5,2021,10,15
13,Könnte besser sein..,"Mir hat das Hotel optisch sehr gefallen. Auch der Check in und Check out waren freundlich und schnell. 
Leider war jedes hot dish und Eierspeise beim Frühstück, obwohl in der Rate inkludiert leider mit je 5€ nicht nachvollziehbar. Das ist für mich leider low level hospitality. Entweder es ist inkludiert oder eben nicht. Aber halbe Sachen wegen 5€ zusätzlichen Umsatz halte ich für schwach. 
Das Zimmer war schön, wenn aber auch teilweise schlecht isoliert. Man konnte sogar den Wecker im Nachbarzimmer und Geräusche auf dem Flur hören (ägyptisches Zimmer). 
Interessantes Hotel mit Optimierungspotential.",3,2021,06,10
13,Perfecto,"Hermoso hotel!! Tienen una terraza super bonita y la decoración del hotel me ha fascinado. Era una fábrica de algodón antiguamente y conservan muchos detalles ! Volveremoss muy pronto.

13,"Gran menú , servicio de Nabil y Manuel excelente","Hemos cenado de 10 y con un trato estupendo. Nabil y Manuel nos han atendido y han sido muy muy agradables. Esperamos volver pronto, con amigos o familia.

13,Romántico y delicado ,"Vivo en Barcelona y quería un hotel romántico y delicado para compartir con mi pareja nuevos momentos especiales.
El Cotton tiene ese ambiente acogedor y agradable que te deja con ganas de más,  aquí vives esos momentos que te hacen amar la vida y la ciudad en la que vives, disfrutar el momento con lo mejor.
Cuánta belleza en cada rincón, y qué buen trato desde el momento en el que entras hasta que sales.
Especial atención al trato que tuvimos por parte de Alex ( en recepción)  y por parte de Jonathan ( en barra), increíble su dedicación y amor por su trabajo, ellos siempre son un 10 y siempre con delicadeza. 
Habitación: estuvimos alojados en la cotton con balcón, desde ahí pudimos disfrutar relajadamente del concierto en la terraza de música clásica, me encantó la experiencia. La habitación muy cómoda y super limpia,  mobiliario de calidad y en perfecto estado. 
Instalaciones: cada rincón tiene su toque y encuentras todo lo que puedes necesitar en cualquier momento con un trato super amable y especial,  me sentí como en casa, porque todo era tranquilo y amable. 
Restaurante: tanto como para desayuno como para comidas,  todo exquisito y con productos de calidad. Cantidades perfectas y sabores deliciosos tal y como nos gusta. 
Por todo esto lo sigo recomendando a familiares y amig@s,  porque sé que aquí van a vivir ese tipo de experiencias que tanto nos gustan y nos alegran la vida.

13,"Excelente combinación, totalmente recomendable. Restaurante Batuar","Acabamos de terminar de celebrar una comida familiar, 21 personas , no quiero dejar pasar más tiempo sin recomendar este oasis en el centro de la ciudad . El servicio no podía ser más cuidado, extraordinariamente amables pero sin interferir en la celebración, en cuanto a la cocina todo perfecto , todos los platos a su temperatura con una decoración muy cuidada , la ubicación inmejorable.
Dejo para el final la decoración y el entorno. Muy acogedor , han sabido transmitir perfectamente el espíritu del eixample barcelonés de finales del 1800 y al mismo tiempo emanar una frescura que convence solo entrar al edificio.",5,2019,12,26
13,Obligatorio visitar el restaurante,"No quiero dejar de lado las perfectas instalaciones del Hotel, pero tengo que destacar el ambiente del comedor que con su terraza y su impresionante decoración hacen olvidar que algún plato del restaurant, digo solo algúno, no esté a la altura de todo lo demás que es perfecto incluido el trato de un personal joven muy profesional. ",5,2019,11,06
13,Exquisito lugar.,"Diferente. Amable. Muy bien ubicado. Excelente atención, excelente comida. Regresaríamos con gusto con mi familia, Cuidado mínimo de los detalles. Atendido por señoritas muy cordiales. Magnifica arquitectura.",5,2019,08,06

13,Exceptional hotel y staff,"Hotel complemente recomendable, uno de los mejores de Barcelona, bien situado, calidad en todos los servicios, personal muy profesional y muy silencioso.
El desayuno es de una calidad extraordinaria, pocos hoteles fuera de España ofrecen tal calidad.
Solo algo negativo: cierto personal no habla español y el check in no fue lo correcto que podría esperar, la habitación no estaba preparada a las 14h, pero solucionable si esperas o puedes esperar hasta las 15h, aunque estuviese preparada 15 minutos antes de las 15h.
Por lo demás uno de los mejores hoteles de la cadena Marriott.",5,2019,04,29
13,Hotel e Bar esclusivi da non perdere a Barcellona,"Meraviglioso hotel, arredato con gusto e dal servizio eccellente.

13,Trato exquisito,"Que decir de este sitio tan maravilloso, la mejor terraza de Barcelona, una oferta gastronómica llena de sabor y armonía.

13,Volvería 100%,"Tuve el placer de hospedarme este mes .
El hotel es muy bonito pero lo que realmente te hace sentir como en casa es el trato del personal .

En recepción tanto Mario, Merce , Javier, Albert y Reyes y todo el equipo . Me ayudaron en todo lo que necesitaba durante mi estancia.

En cuanto a conserjería Cristina Urbieta hizo que cualquier recomendación en restaurante fuera el lazo a mi estancia .

Volvería sin duda !",5,2019,03,08
13,¡Sitio Paradisiaco con empleados mal educados!,"Ya había oído de este hotel hace tiempo atrás, siempre me han hablado muy bien, así que tenia bastante interés en experimentarlo. Decidimos tomar un te en su hermosa terraza llena de plantas y sofás cómodos. Como eran las 5 de la tarde y el sol ya estaba poniéndose, tenia miedo de pasar frío, pero como estábamos en un hotel, supuse que tendrían mantas para ocasiones así. Cuando llegamos al hotel, a la planta del restaurante fuimos completamente ignorados por las recepcionistas, y continuamos caminando hasta el bar y esperamos que alguien nos atendiera. El restaurante tenia 2 o 3 mesas ocupadas y el resto estaba vacío. El chico del bar fue muy amable y llamo una de las camareras. No explicaré la experiencia con todos los detalles pues no fue muy agradable, estuvimos esperando 2 veces entre 15 y 20 minutos para que la chica se acordase de nosotros y no me trajeron la manta, por lo tanto, tuve que entrar para dentro para pedirla. Con la camarera hablábamos en inglés (éramos un grupo internacional) y ella se olvidaba de las palabras básicas, no sabia muchos de los ingredientes que llevaban los platos y siempre se dirigía hacia nosotros de una manera seca y poco amable. En cuanto a la comida nos encanto todo y el sitio es monísimo, especialmente en verano. Pienso que volveré a dar mas de una oportunidad a este sitio con una gran decoración y un ambiente agradable, pero espero que cambien el personal…",3,2019,02,16
13,"La cuenta me dejó frío, como el café","La verdad, es un hotel muy bonito y acogedor con una terraza chula pero, pagar 10€ por un café y un café con leche y que ambos estuvieran fríos... es complicado de entender. He pagado cafés a ése precio pero no eran Nespresso... 
Dejo el comentario a modo de anécdota. Seguro que es un gran hotel con un servicio exquisito.",3,2018,11,18
13,"Una ""bombonera"" en el corazón de Barcelona","Una casa antigua reciclada a nuevo. Calida y acogedora. Las habitaciones muy bien equipadas, las camas muy confortables y también las almohadas.

13,"“Aperitivo impecable, excelente servicio..Gracias Luigi Fummo”!!!","Ayer estuve en el Hotel Cotton House de Barcelona con mis amigos, estuvimos tomando un aperitivo en la terraza del hotel, un lugar precioso, elegante y muy acogedor. Hemos recibido un servicio excelente gracias a Luigi Fummo, un chico joven italiano muy amable y atento en todos los detalles. Gracias a él nuestra estancia ha sido immejorable. Seguro que repetiremos!!",5,2018,10,22

13,Precioso edificio y bien ubicado,"El edificio es precioso! Y esta muy bien ubicado para quienes gustan de caminar porque no está EN medio de todo el bullicio de la gente pero si cerca. A dos cuadras de la avenida de Gracia y a tres de la Rambla . Desde la terraza se puede ver la Sagrada Familia . 
La cama muy cómoda y un excelente baño. 
El personal es muy muy amable, tal vez mi única crítica sería que son todos muy jóvenes y eso tal vez repercute en detalles como que pedimos por teléfono que envíen a alguien a la pieza a buscar las maletas porque ya nos íbamos (habíamos hecho el check out la noche anterior ) y nos aburrimos de esperar porque nadie llegó. Finalmente bajamos por nuestra cuenta. En cuanto llegamos al lobby un joven amablemente tomó nuestras maletas y las llevó afuera donde llamaron a un taxi. Asumo que fue un descuido de la chica que estaba en ese momento en el front desk y que recibió la llamada. ",5,2018,10,09
13,SERVICIO DE LUJO ENTRE ALGODONES PARA UNA OCASIÓN MUY ESPECIAL,"Nos alojamos mi pareja y yo durante una noche. Se trataba de una ocasión muy especial para sorprender a mi chica. Y como esperaba, no nos defraudaron, estuvieron más que a la altura e incluso se superaron.

Estuvimos en una habitación Cotton, preciosa y muy romántica, como todo el hotel en general. Es un hotel con mucho encanto, en el que nada más entrar, te das cuenta que tiene algo muy especial, desde la decoración, las zonas comunes, el restaurante con su peculiar terraza, unas buenas vistas con una ubicación inmejorable, y por supuesto, un servicio de 11 que siempre se muestra atento con una gran sonrisa, que hace que te sientas como en casa.

Me gustaría agradecer al Cotton House que nos haya acogido para esta bonita experiencia, pero sobretodo, quiero destacar y hacer mención especial a Gabriel Borrego, el Concierge. Él ha hecho, junto con el equipo de Gossypium, que todo lo que tenía pensado se convirtiera en realidad, no falto ni un detalle, e incluso salió mejor de lo que esperaba, EXCELENTE! Hay cosas en la vida que no tienen precio, y el ser capaz de colaborar en hacer algo tan bonito y mágico para crear emociones irrepetibles, esto no tiene precio. 

MUCHÍSIMAS GRACIAS Y MUCHAS FELICIDADES COTTON HOUSE!!!",5,2018,09,26
13,Un rincón especial,"Hay muchos sitios mágicos en Barcelona, a este le tengo mucho cariño porque es un rincón de la ciudad muy especial.

Suelo ir a medio día entre semana, ideal con amigos, pareja o comida de negocio, si tú idea es dejar huella y hacer que la persona que te acompaña se acuerde de ese momento, es el sitio ideal!

Con el menú ejecutivo, comes súper bien, los platos son de 5 estrellas y el servicio es impecable. Luego si quieres moverte y tomar el café o en la terraza i en la biblioteca, te sentirás como alguien de casa.

Ahora si te voy a desvelar un secreto, pide a la recepción si pueden hacerte una visita guiada y descubrirás lo que se esconde detrás de ese encanto de sitio. Después de la visita verás ese algo mágico que te captó desde el primer momento.

El menú cambia cada semana así que... a ver qué te va a tocar, y si eres de carta, hay muchos platos que podrán sorprender tú paladar.

Déjate sorprender !",5,2018,09,16
13,Otro hotel que NO ES PETFRIENDLY,"Otro hotel 5* GL que no es nada recomendable en Barcelona pues no es Petfriendly, al contrario que otros hoteles 5*GL en Barcelona ( no voy a nombrarlos para no generar agravios comparativos ) o en otras capitales del Mundo. Si al menos no son sensibles con los animales que piensen en el poder adquisitivo de los que tenemos mascotas. Increíble una actitud así en un hotel 5*GL, de una pensión lo entendería pero de un establecimiento que se supone cosmopolita y que dispone de un servicio excelente, lamentable y nada recomendable y desde luego denunciable. Dejo una foto de mi mascota ",1,2018,08,24
13,Restaurante con muy buen menu de mediodia,"Fuimos con la empresa y disfrutamos de su menu de mediodia en su espectacular terraza.
Solo entrar en su hotel, ya notas que estas entrando en un sitio con estilo y buen gusto. Se nota que estas en un hotel de 5 estrellas y todo el personal esta acordeal sitio. (Presencia, educación, pulcritud, estilo).

El menu se componia de 3 opciones de primero, de segundo y de postre. (Foto del menu) con vinos/aguas incluidos. Tambien hay petit fours al acabar.
En mi caso disfruté del gazpcho de fresa, del solomillo y del brownie de chocolate. Todo estaba en su punto y fue una velada perfecta.

Esa terraza es perfecta para tomar algo en cualquier momento. Aunque el restaurante dispone de una zona interior, impresionante y bien decorada. Para recomendar y repetir.",5,2018,08,07

13,Solo para tomar una copa,"En esta ocasion no voy a evaluar el Hotel ya que no pernocte en el. 
Pero me lo habian recomendado como un pequeño y lujoso paraiso de peace and quiet para quedar, tomarte un copa, relajarte y todo eso en pleno centro de Barcelona.
Y os aseguro que no me ha defraudado. 
Tranquilo, discreto y selecto. 
Muy ""chick""",5,2018,07,17
13,Sitio muy especial,"He comido en la terraza del restaurante, al aire libre, rodeada de plantas. Hay bastantes mesas pero no te sientes para nada agobiado por la cercanía, las plantas  y los niveles separan muy bien. Comimos con unos amigos el menú. Me pareció excelente, muy bien presentado y muy sabroso. El servicio sencillamente estupendo.",5,2018,07,12
13,Cocktail de cumpleaños,"Para celebrar el cumpleaños de mi chica, hemos acudido a la terraza de este hotel. Hemos tomado un cocktail y lo cierto es que es mejorable y el servicio lento aunque gentil. 

El estar rodeado de plantas hace que tengas la sensación de no encontrarte en pleno centro de la ciudad condal, y lo acompaña un hilo musical muy apropiado.

El lugar en general, desprende un aire antiguo con cierto toque moderno que lo convierten en un sitio singular. 

El hotel dispone de dos escaleras majestuosas, una con la baranda de marmol original y la otra colgada desde el techo (ver imagen en adjunto).

Ambiente de lo más selecto 😊",4,2018,07,01
13,"Lujo, personalidad y generosidad","Tengo que decir que ha sido una agradable sorpresa, desde que entras hay un ambiente único que ha sabido renovar la imagen del edificio sin perder la idiosincrasia de la algodonera, el interiorismo es exquisito y han sabido cuidar los detalles.

13,ESPECTACULAR,"En el momento que el mozo de equipaje te abre con una sonrisa de oreja a oreja la puerta del taxi para darte la bienvenida, sabes que la experiencia será muy buena, ese tipo de servicio solo se tiene en hoteles que cuidan hasta el ultimo detalle. La historia del hotel es preciosa, las habitaciones muy confortables, las zonas comunes preciosas y tomarse una copa de vino en la magnifica terraza es un gran placer. 
Me encantaron los uniformes del personal, muy estilosos, y destacar sobre todo la amabilidad y profesionalidad del personal del hotel, especialmente el de Laura, jefa de recepción que fué encantadora en nuestra visita a Barcelona. BRAVO",5,2018,04,05

13,Zum dritten Mal auf der Terrasse. Zum dritten Mal nicht bedient.,"Wir leben in Barcelona und sind nun innerhalb der letzten 6 Monate zum dritten Mal hier. Zu unserem größten bedauern muss ich sagen: einfach schlechter Service. Positiv ist, dass man sich in schöner Umgebung von der Hektik des Tages erholen kann. Ohne etwas verzehren zu müssen. Schlecht ist, dass man auch nicht die Gelegenheit bekommt etwas zu verzehren. Es kümmert sich einfach niemand. Obgleich ausreichend Personal vorhanden wäre. Keine Begrüßung, obgleich wir an zwei Mitarbeitern vorbei gingen. Dies war nun unser letzter Besuch. Adios Cotton House.",1,2018,03,10

13,tranquilo y relajado,"El hotel es precioso, las diferentes estancias son ideales. El sitio es tranquilo y muy agradable al igual que el servicio muy atento. Voy a menudo a comer o a tomar algo. El único pero es que las raciones son muy justas.",4,2018,01,12
13,De los mejores encuadres de las ciudad,"Precioso y mágico lugar en Barcelona, todo está cuidado desde el mínimo detalle,es de los mejores encuadres de la ciudad. Nos atendió Edward muy atento y nos hizo sentir cómo en casa.Lo cierto es que tienes desde la biblioteca ,terraza, sastreria es un lugar realmente precioso con una luz increíble y por la noche también es súper acogedor.",5,2017,12,21
13,Una Selecta experiencia,"Decidi celebrar mi primer aniversario en este hotel emblematico, superaron ampliamente mis espectativas, no solo por lo esplendido del edificio, su decoracion, habitaciones, vistas, comida escepcional, etc,etc,etc  sino por algo mas fundamental como es un servicio extraordinario de los chicos/as de Conserjeria, que consiguieron sorprenderme gratamente y hacerme sentir muy especial, felicidades a Damian, Sonia y Alfredo por el gran equipo que son.",5,2017,12,17
13,Espectacular. Hotel con encanto. Personal maravilloso.,"Hemos estado el fin de semana haciendo turismo. Hotel situado súper centrico para poder visitar Barcelona. Hotel precioso, con muchisimo encanto y cuidado todo con mucho mimo y detalle.  Nada mas llegar te explican todas las estancias e historia del hotel y te ofrecen agua, cava o un trocito de tarta. El desayuno es fabuloso, muchísima variedad tanto de dulce como de salado en un encantador salon con vistas al jardin que tiene el hotel. El jardin es espectacular, además una vez al mes organizan un mercadillo que tiene mucho ambiente. Nosotros estuvimos alojados en una habitacion superior con balcón. La habitación está decorada con mucho mimo, tamaño bastante bueno y con un colchón que da ganas de no levantarse por la mañana de lo agusto que se duerme en el.  Por ultimo hablar del personal del hotel, están todos muy atentos a lo que necesites, siempre con una sonrisa y con muchas ganas de hacer la estancia inmejorable. Sin duda si se visita Barcelona este es el hotel donde hay que alojarse.",5,2017,11,19
13,Sehr schönes Hotel,"Das Hotel ist ein Traum. Wir waren vom Design und auch vom freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Personal begeistert. Besonders erfreulich, trotz der Wertigkeit des Hauses ist es kein steifes und langweiliges Hotel. Das wird insbesondere durch das junge aber fachlich sehr gute Team ausgemacht. 
Einziger Grund warum es keine volle Punktzahl gibt ist das Frühstück. Warum muss man bitte in einem 5 Sterne Haus, mit Zimmerpreisen um 390 Euro die Nacht, noch zusätzlich für ein paar Rühreier zahlen? ",4,2017,08,11
13,"DISEÑO EXCELENTE, TRATO LAMENTABLE","Es uno de los hoteles más bonitos seguramente en estos momentos en la ciudad de Barcelona por su arquitectura y diseño. Su terraza, en la que estuve una vez hace meses para tomar algo, es extraordinaria. Su servicio y el producto no obstante me pareció standard simplemente.
Pero lo más sorprendente e indignante fue el trato recibido hace pocos días cuando, tras informarme de que la terraza estaba llena y no había mesa libre, impidieron que simplemente se la pudiera mostrar a mi marido ya que él no había estado nunca. Nos impideron pisar literalmente la terraza, cuando en cualquier hotel de Barcelona te brindan amablemente la posibilidad de entrar, contemplar las vistas un momento y largarte si no quieres quedarte o si efectivamente no hay sitio. Demostraron una falta total de educación, de tacto, de profesionalidad y en definitiva del nivel que esperas, ya no en un 5 estrellas, sinó en cualquier sitio donde el equipo tenga un mínimo de sentido común.",2,2017,08,08
13,Cena en restaurante Cotton House,"El hotel del siglo XIX  recién restaurado es precioso , digno de ser visitado,  la terraza superior, acogedora y llena de vegetación recrea el estilo colonial de entonces con mucho encanto .
La cena estupenda y el servicio muy bueno. 
Muy recomendable !",5,2017,07,11
13,Una comida extraordinaria,"Si quieren ser transportado a una ciudad colonial no demés
 de ir a comer al restaurante del hotel Cotton house ya sea para una comida o una cena
Quedaràs cautivado por su planta noble y ambiente del comedor, y si es una cena en la terraza por su magnífico ambiente, degustaras una buena comida , su personal es Muy amable",5,2017,07,11
13,Un oasis en una gran urbe,"Es un hotel en la antigua Sede de la Asosiciación de Fabricantes de Algodón (XIX). 

Un edificio histórico que han restaurado y que se puede disfrutar, sin estar alojados. La decoración es muy interesante y la terraza un oasis en una urbe. 

Sugiero visitar la biblioteca y todos los detalles en general. El patio/terraza de la primera planta, muy recomendable.

Tomar algo en la terraza es desconectar y tener la sensación de viajar sin salir de la ciudad. El precio no es barato pero tampoco es extremadamente caro. La comida es correcta pero tampoco la mejor del mundo. El servicio es internacional, joven y amable. 
La sensación de gozo, relax y tranquilidad disfrutando de un café o una copa, es genial.",4,2017,06,25
13,vibraciones antiguas del poderoso Gremio Algodonero de Barcelona,"todas sus paredes emiten vibraciones de historias antiguas. Se siente el ambiente de lo que antaño fue el poderoso Gremio Algodonero de Barcelona. Un lugar ideal para dejar impresionado a quien se quiera dejar sorprender.
Lo recomiendo.",5,2017,06,07
13,Encanto único ,"Espectacular hotel que te transporta a otro tiempo y lugar. Tienes la sensación  de estar en plena  naturaleza en el Caribe. Las habitaciones y la atención son maravillosas y está a dos calles de plaza catalunya. Su terraza es maravillosa. El menú es bueno, ronda los 28 euros y es muy saludable.  Asimismo, el café cuesta 4,5€ pero te lo sirven con bombones. Cuidan mucho los detalles.",5,2017,06,03
13,Sorprendente,"El restaurante es muy bonito, con una terraza-patio maravillosa.
La comida buena, pero con grandes pretensiones. El servicio es bueno y son muy amables, pero les falta categoría y clase para lo que quieren ser",4,2017,06,03
13,Excelente comida en el pop-up Indian restaurant,"Situado dentro de este magnífico hotel, el restaurante ofrece una explosión de sabores de la India y el Mediterráneo de la mano del chef Indú Atul Kochhar, con varias estrellas Michelín. Hemos ido en família y todos hemos probado el menú degustación, ver foto subida; nos ha parecido que viajábamos por la India subidos al carro de las especies, sabores y olores de su comida, pero con toques mediterráneos. Hemos disfrutado mucho, nos ha gustado todo (excepto el arroz con hojas de curry-coco que acompañaba las gambas); el espacio está muy bien decorado, el ambiente es magnífico, elegante y moderno sin estridencias. La mejor opción de comida India en estos momentos en Barcelona! Si hace buen tiempo, la terraza es fantástica! ",5,2017,05,06
13,Das beste Hotel in Barcelona,"Ich habe viele Male Barcelona besucht, und ich habe in vielen Hotels übernachtet und ich kann sagen, dass Baumwolle zweifellos eines der besten Hotels, hervorragende Concierge der Welt, Gastronomie up ist und die Lage ist unschlagbar, ich denke, es ich werde nicht Hotel in der Stadt wechseln.",5,2017,05,04
13,Excepcional,"Perfecta ubicación en Barcelona.
Hotel tranquilo, ambiente muy agradable con un personal muy atento.
La habitación perfecta con sus sabanas de algodón.
El baño de época.
Una perfecta estancia en Barcelona
",5,2017,05,01
13,Como en casa!,"Había ido varias veces a su restaurante pero siempre me quedé con las ganas de hospedarme en el Hotel, y como era de esperar, no defraudó! Es como despertar en el paraíso! Habitación cómoda, baño espacioso y la cama es como una nube!!! Es como un segundo hogar incluso para un Barcelonino!!",5,2017,04,23
13,Impresionante hotel,Hotel con una categoria espectacular. Restaurado con su encanto del anterior paso a la fabrica del coto. Tienen unas habitaciones muy agradables e intimas con vistas a la cuidad de barcelona. Lo recomiendo.,5,2017,04,22
13,De visita turistica familiar,"Facilidades fisicas del Hotel son exelentes , todo es nuevo y habitacion y hotel super limpio , localizacion céntrica , no necesitas tener coche puedes caminar a atracciones turisticas mas importantes de Barcelona , trato en el hotel es excepcional , exelente 100% , A+. Los felicito . Y me honraron mis puntos de Marriott que tenia acumulados. Gracias , regreso el proximo año !",5,2017,04,19
13,"Tolles Hotel, sehr schön, aber nicht günstig.","Wir waren nach einer Transatlantik Kreuzfahrt noch eine Nacht in Barcelona und übernachteten im Cotton House.
Extrem aufgefallen ist uns die Freundlichkeit des Personals. Dies hat uns extrem gefallen. 
Wir hatten ein Zimmer im sechsten Stock. Dort gibt es eine schöne Terasse mit kleinem Pool.
Das Zimmer war sehr schön, tip top sauber und bequeme Betten. 
Kaffeemaschine im Zimmer.",5,2017,04,17
13,Cena di Lavoro in un ambiente unico della Barcellona Modernista,"Si cena in un ambiente veramente rilassante, assaggiando piatti originali. La collezione di antichi lini contenuta nelle vetrine, l'esposizione di porcellane olandesi e molti altri pezzi unici ne fanno un piccolo museo. Carta dei vini ben fornita e interessante. Personale gentilissimo. ",5,2017,04,04
13,"Cool, warm & charming","Definitivamente, un lugar para quedarse. Todo en este hotel es elegante y con encanto. El aroma, la música... Es íntimo y muy cool, para disfrutarlo mucho. El staff es un encanto, sin excepción. Y la noche debe sin falta comenzar tomando un cocktail preparado por Jonatán, que con su saber hacer colaboró y mucho en hacer nuestra estancia perfecta. Un auténtico placer en todos los sentidos",5,2017,03,21
13,Tolles Design,"Das Cotton House ist ein edles Boutique Hotel in einer der prime Locations von Barcelona. Das Hotel überzeugt durch sein Interieur Design und seine Architektur. In der Bar mit Dachterrasse, wo man im Übrigen morgens auch sein Frühstückt serviert bekommt, kann man gut und gerne auch den ganzen Abend verbringen. Das Personal ist erfrischend jung und international. Es fehlt aber nicht an Erfahrung. Auch das Publikum und die Hotelgäste waren ein Gewinn für die gemütliche Atmosphäre am Abend.
Die Zimmer sind klein, sehr sauber und aufgeräumt und bieten alles was man für den Komfort für ein paar Tage braucht. Auch hier spielt das Interieur Design wieder die Hauptrolle. Die Cotton Bettwäsche war der Hit.
Leider war ich nur eine Nacht im Haus. Ich werde es aber nicht vergessen. Weiterhin viel Erfolg ...",5,2017,02,23
13,Encantador hotel lleno de historia,"Nos ha gustado muchísimo !!!! La atención del personal, excelente. La habitación, de tamaño suficiente y una decoración con la base del algodón y tonos blancos, preciosa, además nos ha tocado una en la sexta planta con buenas vistas. Los espacios comunes están llenos de historia, fue la sede del Gremio del algodón en Barcelona, todos los rincones   transmiten paz y sosiego. Para repetir...... Hasta la próxima !!",5,2017,02,03
13,Trato excelente en un hotel con todo cuidado al detalle,"Fuimos a comer y pasar la tarde en el hotel porque nos lo habían recomendado. Nos sorprendió tanto la acogida del personal, como la comida excelente. Sin pedirlo nos ofrecieron una visita guiada por el hotel y pudimos comprobar como las habitaciones y espacios comunes estan perfectamente cuidados y decorados. Un hotel con aires vintage pero con toques modernos. Lo mejor, la calidad humana de su personal.
Sin duda volveremos para alojarnos.",5,2017,01,30
13,Wow AMAZING place (small details to improve),"El hotel es simplemente maravilloso en su arquitectura, cada espacio tiene un sabor especial y encantador. No se ve un hotel viejo sino con clase y actual.

Mi habitación es cómoda aunque pequeña, cómoda si estás solo pero seguramente no lo es tanto si viajas con alguien. El baño es totalmente impersonal.

Aunque se notan los detalles y limpieza, el mobiliario se ve algo maltratado, un detalle que podrían cuidar. Aunque no tiene nada que ver con el hotel, hoy llegue al mismo tiempo que terminaban de limpiar mi habitación y con todo respeto a la persona que lo limpiaba, su olor a sudor dejo impregnada mi habitación, tuve que abrir la ventana para que el olor desapareciera, quizá soy muy extremo en esto y no quiero ofender pero no es lo que se espera de un hotel de esta categoría. 

A pesar de lo anterior puedo decir que me encanta el hotel, llevo 2 noches y estaré aquí 7 más por lo que podré actualizar este review en caso de tener más detalles pero lo que he visto hasta ahora es muy bueno.

El restaurante es maravilloso, solo he desayunado ahí y la verdad tanto el servicio como la comida es deliciosa. 

9/ 10 hasta el
Momento :)

13,Después de un viajes de 8 horas nada como llegar a un buen hotel,"Nuestra estadía en Barcelona fue bien placentera en este hotel;  un emblemático edificio del siglo XIX y antigua sede de la fundación Textil Algodonera.
Cómo llegamos bien temprano por la mañana y nos tocó esperar por nuestra habitación; uno de los empleados nos ofreció un pequeño recorrido por el hotel para así familiarizarnos. 
Les cuento que valió la pena, porque conocimos un poco de la historia del edificio; el cual fue construido por una familia de la alta burguesía catalana.

Tiene un estilo neoclásico de 6 pisos y conserva todavía su escalinata de mármol, finos parques y boiseries que pueden apreciar en los techos, suelos y en algunas paredes. Está ubicado en la Gran Vía de les Corts Catalanes, 670 08010. Esta avenida es una de las más importantes de la ciudad.

La habitación me encanto; bien cómoda y amplia y con vista a la Gran Vía. El colchón y las almohadas: super porque para mi eso es bien importante a la hora de dormir.

El área del comedor me encanto; tiene un área al aire libre en una terraza, la piscina está en el último piso, no es una piscina grande; es bien pequeña. El servicio de concierge está el piso del restaurante bien amables y atentos por si necesitan información de adonde ir.

El hotel esta bien ubicado; prácticamente se puede ir a muchos lugares caminando si no les molestan las caminatas. Como la habitación nos las entregaban para después del mediodía; decidimos ir a recorrer la ciudad.

Caminamos desde el hotel hacia la izquierda hasta la plaza Cataluña. Allí tomamos uno de los autobuses turísticos de dos pisos; que para mí, está la mejor manera de conocer las ciudades que están visitando para así ubicarse en ellas al principio.

Los precios del hotel están en el rango de hoteles caros pero razonables.",5,2017,01,16
13,¿A quién se le ocurrieron esos uniformes para el personal...? Todo un asombro,"Decoración impecable en un edificio magnífico cargado de historia, convertido en hotel que, al parecer conserva un servicio de sastrería a medida. Inexplicable que en un hotel de este porte las camareras del bar-restaurante vayan uniformadas de la forma más corriente y vulgar. Me llamaron, inlcuso, la atención las bailarinas que calzan que son las que se ven en las tiendas más baratas del mercado. Parecía más propio el uniforme de un bar tex-mex que de un hotel de lujo. No me imagino así al personal del hotel Ritz o de cualquier otro cinco estrellas que uno haya podido visitar. Todo un desacierto y una rotunda falta de buen gusto, que desentona con el resto del escenario.",4,2017,01,06
13,Excelente pero lastima ,"Nos alojamos en el cotton H , el hotel de un estilo sofisticado con una decoración muy actual y acogedor, las habitaciones muy bonitas pero muy pequeñas , lo malo de este hotel es que pertenece a una cadena internacional como Marriott y ya los precios de las comidas , aguas en el cuarto y de más se van por arriba de hoteles locales que no son las cadenas internacionales que son  más libres y menos rígidas , en total yo opino que fuera de los precios y del tamaño de la habitación es un 100",4,2017,01,01
13,Buen menú en un gran entorno,"Celebramos la comida de empresa, menú a 28 euros con tres primeros y tres segundos y postre, bebida a parte, platos elaborados aunque un poco justos algunos, servicio excelente, y un espacio espectacular, vale la pena visitarlo. ",5,2016,12,19
13,Conserje ,"Lamentable experiencia en el dia de hoy, sábado 17 de diciembre, con el conserje ? Del hotel, sin levita?
Mal educado y grosero, impropio de un lugar como este hotel y mas propio de un local de una discoteca nocturna, el hotel no se lo merece.
Situaciones como esta desmerecen la buena imagen del hotel
",3,2016,12,17
13,Mejor estancia imposible,"Si estais buscando uno de los mejores hoteles de Barcelona, por no decir el mejor donde vuestra estancia sea única e irrepetible y la atención envidiable tan sólo teneis que ir a este magnífico hotel situado en el centro de Barcelona.

El personal nos trató de manera muy especial realizandonos indicaciones y acertando de pleno con cada una de nuestras necesidades. Siempre con una sonrisa y un gesto amable. El desayuno muy correcto y la zona de cócteles increibles!

Recomendaría a todo aquel que quiera tener una estancia inolvidable y se sienta como en casa a visitar este hotel del que va a quedar encantado más que seguro.

Agradezco a todo el staff de Cotton House Barcelona en especial a Olga que nos ""acompañó"" en nuestra velada desde el principio hasta el final y dónde pudimos constatar su profesionalidad y experiencia a lo largo del tiempo.",5,2016,12,12
13,Beeindruckendes Restaurant - einmalig schön!!!,"Ich war sofort von dem Gebäude so beeindruckt. Es war wirklich wunderschön. Das Essen ein Traum, die Bedienung mehr als freundlich & fachmännisch, sehr aufmerksam! Nach dem Besuch erhielten wir noch eine kleine Führung durch die Räumlichkeiten.
",5,2016,12,10
13,Wunderschön,"In diesem Hotel stimmt fast alles. Die Zimmer sehr geschmackvoll, die Betten herrlich.
Der Speisesaal wunderschön., Angebot beim Frühstück grosszügig. Service langsam.
Aufenthaltsraum ein Traum. 
Die Lage sehr gut.
Wir waren sehr zufrieden, sofort wieder hinzugehen.",5,2016,11,28
13,Cocktails,"Espacio singular y especial que te traslada a épocas pasadas de la Barcelona Industrial del algodón. En la primera planta hay el Bar-Coctelería del hotel, cocktails excelentes a 14eu. Staff jovial y agradable. ",5,2016,11,20
13,Diferente pero cómodo,"Un hotel diferente pero bastante cómodo. La habitación era grande y el desayuno tenía lo necesario para desayunar sin lujos. La atención fue maravillosa y la ubicación buena, estas cerca de la ópera y avenidas principales",4,2016,11,05
13,Servicio por encima de las expectativas,"Excelente desde la recepcion hasta la despedida, el concierge muy muy acertado con las recomendaciones de restaurantes asi que pueden confiar plenamente. La comida no fué el top pero no esta nada mal. Me gustaron sus camas y los tejidos, fabulosa estancia.",5,2016,10,29
13,Muy buena opción en Barcelona,"Es un hotel muy bonito y súper bien ubicado. Lo que más me llamó la atención es la calidez y la amabilidad de todos los que trabajan ahí. Desde el chico de las maletas, recepcionistas, gente de limpieza etc.
Todo esta decorado con muy buen gusto y las cosas son de muy buena calidad...
Camas súper cómodas, la calidad de las sabanas muy buenas.
Estuvimos solo 2 días, y la habitación que nos toco, si bien era muy bonita y cómoda y con balcón era un poco pequeña.
El baño está integrado a la habitación y solo lo separa una puerta corrediza. 
Pero es un poco incómodo porque si uno está por ejemplo, lavándose los dientes y con toalla; pueden tocar la puerta y uno tiene que correr a encerrarse en el cuarto de la ducha para que los del servicio no te vean...
No sé cómo serán las otras habitaciones; deben de haber otros modelos.
Pero en general si es un hotel al que sin duda volvería
",4,2016,10,13
13,Inmejorable,"La verdad es que he estado en pocos hoteles donde el buen trato, la puntualidad y el cuidado por los detalles sea tan elevado... te sientes como en casa. El menú exquisito. Volveré pronto, muy recomendable.",5,2016,10,13
13,Tolles Ambiente im ehemaligen Haus der Gilde der Baumwollhersteller,"Beim Betreten des Hauses hat man sofort ein ""Wow!"" auf den Lippen und ist beeindruckt von der Aura und Atmosphäre des Hauses. Die Zimmer sind gut, vielleicht ein wenig klein und bei Weitem nicht so spektakulär wie die Räume der Bibliothek, der Bar und des Restaurants. Die Einrichtung ist freundlich und mit vielen kleinen Details versehen. Der Check In war zügig und zuvorkommend. Der Service ist überhaupt sehr gut.

Leider war das Frühstück nur durchschnittlich und das gebuchte Taxi erschien gleich gar nicht.

Alles in Allem hat es uns sehr gut gefallen und wir würden wahrscheinlich wieder buchen.",4,2016,10,04
13,"Céntrico, clásico y detallista","Realmente es un hermoso hotel! Posee una terraza espectacular, habitaciones bellamente decoradas y camas relajantes. El personal realmente amable y siempre súper pendientes de cualquier necesidad. Como cereza del pastel un desayuno delicioso. 
No dejar de mencionar que se encuentra en una una ubicación ideal para conocer la ciudad y lugares para ir a comer.
Fui de luna de miel y quedamos con una experiencia muy grata. ",5,2016,10,02
13,Cooles Interior,"Sehr spannende Location!
Ich kenne Barcelona schon lange und bin mehrmals im Jahr dort. Kürzlich war ich zum ersten Mal im Cotton House.
Eine Oase in der Nähe vom Plaza Catalunya . Wir waren zum Chillen, für einen Kaffeestopp oder Tea-Time da. Die Räume sind ein guter Insidertip für Interiordesigner und -liebhaber.",5,2016,09,25
13,Hotel Con Servicio de Entradas al Camp Nou,"Excelente alternativa para los Fanaticos y seguidores del Futbol Club Barcelona, pues el Hotel ofrece el servicio de entradas al Camp Nou como una experiencia única, pueden vivir la emoción del futbol en tu visita a Barcelona. solo deben solicitar en el Counter de Recepción y les aseguro que contaran con mas de lo esperado.",5,2016,09,15
13,Excelente hotel,"Un hotel muy bien decorado, súper limpio y el personal súper atento, muy bien localizado a unos pasos de todo lo turístico de Barcelona el restaurante muy bueno y tiene una terraza bar excelente para la noche",5,2016,09,09
13,Clásico con gusto,"El Cotton House Hotel es un hotel clásico (no sería mi tipo de hotel) que está ejecutado con una clase que va más allá de toda duda. Creo que es el único hotel de este tipo que he visto en el que me encantaría pasar una noche. Las habitaciones en persona son realmente impresionantes, así como las zonas comunes del hotel.",5,2016,09,02
13,MEJOR IMPOSIBLE !!!,"Definitivamente uno de los mejores hoteles en los que me he hospedado. Tiene un concepto increíble, muy buena ubicación, el personal super amable y todo esta lleno de pequeños detalles que hacen que sea una experiencia inolvidable.
Sin duda el mejor hotel de Barcelona.",5,2016,09,01
13,The best hotel in BCN!,"Me alojé una noche y hay que decir que el lugar es fabuloso, una decoración increible digna de la categoría del Hotel. Todo el staff muy atento desde el check in hasta mi salida. Tuve la habitación en la planta 6 y una localización muy tranquila. Descatacar el trabajo del Gossip Team, en especial Alfredo, por sus ""welcoming words"" escritas en el espejo de la habitación y por las amenidades. En recepción destacar la atención de Alexis en el turno de noche por el fabuloso trato, al igual que Eduard quién nos atendió en el desayuno buffet.
A mi vuelta a Barcelona, no dudaré en repetir. Gracias a todos!! MR",5,2016,08,24
13,Excelente y Maravilloso!,Me encanto el Hoetl... Muy elegante y moderno! Tienen una terraza Maravillosa! El personagen es muy simpatico... Un punto mas a Alfredo Martinez una pesona super educada y querida... Muchas Gracias por la Excelente Experiencia ...regesaré seguro!,5,2016,08,23
13,Excelente experiencia!,"Sin duda es un hotel digno de su nivel. Excelente servicio de todo el personal del hotel. Buenos consejos y recomendaciones para visitar la ciudad de Barcelona!

No hay que dejar de tomar uno de los fantásticos cócteles que se sirven en la terraza del restaurante! Ambiente perfecto para tomar algo con amigos.",5,2016,08,17
13,Gran recuerdo para nuestro 26 aniversario de boda. Fantástico,"Elegimos por segunda vez este hotel para celebrar nuestro 26 aniversario de boda. Gran detalle de bienvenida. Felicidades al servicio de recepción y a gossipium. Hotel muy bien equipado, cuidado y con personalidad. Un consejo, el desayuno una maravilla, vale la pena.

13,"Excelente hotel, servicio y atención ","Merece la pena vivir la experiencia del hotel Cotton House, todo el personal ofrece una atención exquisita. Un 5 estrellas de verdad.
Además,  desayunar, comer o cenar en el rest. Batuar es una grata experiencia. Y por supuesto tomarse una copa.",5,2016,08,09
13,"Ninguna duda, hay que venir ","Acabando de cenar en el restaurante del hotel ""Batuar"" muy muy agradable, servicio impecable no quiero menospreciar a nadie, pero las dos personas que nos han atendido, un 10, la srta. Elvira Hiomar y el sr. Tony Paitubi, recomiendo que los conserven.
En recepción la srta Sonia, una amabilidad.....
Lo recomiendo en todos los sentidos ",5,2016,08,08
13,Sempre bello,"Siamo tornati in questo hotel dopo un anno avendo vissuto una piacevolissima precedente esperienza.
La sensazione è stata assolutamente riconfermata. 
L'accoglienza è sempre molto calda ed attenta, pur essendo molto giovane lo staff è  assolutamente competente e professionale.

Le camere sono molto comode, e arredate con gusto. 

La colazione tipica locale servita su una calda terrazza.

Infine la posizione dell'hotel è comoda per la visita della città 

Torneremo di sicuro con piacere 

",5,2016,08,07
13,Buen hotel,"Me hospedé en el cotton house por 4 noches. La recepción fue impecable. Gran servicio, los empleados siempre bien predispuestos a ayudar en todo. 
La terraza que tiene el hotel es increíble. Muy linda y cálida. 
Me encanto el hotel. Muy completo: buena ubicación, buena atención, gran decoración y tiene hasta pileta.
Sin dudas volvería.",4,2016,07,30
13,Cotton House,"Increíble ambientación, mucha calidez! Personal de recepcion siempre dispuestos a brindar soluciones.Muy bien ubicado,a 4 cuadras de paseo de Gracia , plaza catalunya y de diversos lugares de interés turístico. Volvería sin dudarlo.

13,Un oasis en plena ciudad,"Un sitio mágico, con historia, un olor que te atrapa y una terraza de ensuño. Un oasis en plena Ciudad Condal. Un hotel maravilloso, con una decoración cuidada hasta el minimo detalle y unos postres .... exquisitos!! Para tomarse unos cocktails en la terraza y desconectar de todo.",5,2016,07,26
13,Un hotel nuevo  con historia ,"El hotel y en sí es bueno. La ubicación,su interesante historia y la decoración cálida hacen la diferencia. Cuenta con una terraza increíble donde se pueden disfrutar las diferentes comidas del día. Recomiendo ir a cenar! 
Sin embargo, con respecto a las habitaciones, no son cómodas ya que son muy pequeñas. ",4,2016,07,25
13,visité la terraza del Hotel para tomar un cocktail,"Terraza genial para ir con una chica o unos amigos a desconectar.
Tomé un daikiri de limón y me encantó -espectacular- también tomé un amaretto sour y de los mejores que he tomado nunca.
La camarera que me atendió, muy simpática.
La decoración del hotel, también escandalosa.
Felicidades.",5,2016,07,18
13,Un oasis en Barcelona,"Cenar en el jardin interior de este hotel es una delicia, el servicio es muy bueno y la calidad de la comida excelente. El precio es algo elevado pero el entorno y la calidad lo merecen. La decoracion de los salones interiores tambien es espectacular y vale la pena darse una vuelta.
",5,2016,07,13
13,Un lugar especial,"Un hotel con una localización estupenda para moverte por la ciudad, es de gama alta y se nota en cada detalle. La decoración no puede ser más bonita y las habitaciones son preciosas. Es una de las camas más cómodas que he probado en mi vida. El desayuno muy variado y delicioso. Sin duda para repetir.",5,2016,07,10
13,Una experiencia única,"Nos hemos alojado una noche en el Cotton House en Barcelona y ha sido realmente una experiencia única. El hotel, además de tener un diseño espectacular, puede presumir de un personal excelente. Tanto el equipo de recepción como el del restaurante cuidaron hasta el más mínimo detalle. El desayuno es espectacular y la localización no puede ser mejor. Gracias especialmente a Alfredo (gossypium) que nos tuvo ""entre algodones"".",5,2016,07,10
13,Hotel de 5 estrellas con servicio de 4,"Hotel espectacular, con una historia interesante detrás; olor exquisito y magnificas instalaciones e ubicación.

Una pena que tengan demasiada gente en practicas, ya que hay una mezcla de excelente profesionales con becarios que tienen muchos fallos que un hotel de 5 estrellas no se puede permitir; por ejemplo, cada día en el desayuno se olvidaban de subir algo, una servilleta, las tostadas, el zumo... En serio?!

Tampoco repusieron ninguno de los 4 días que estuvimos alojados las cápsulas de cafe y te complementarias, o los frutos secos y el agua que consumimos el primer día al llegar.

La limpieza del baño debería ser un poco mas profunda, ya que las esquinas de la ducha tenia un poco de moho negro y las pared al lado del WC tenia algunas manchas, que estoy segura que si le ponen un poco de interés salen en un momentito frotando o con algún producto especial.

También me sorprendió que para lo nuevo que es el hotel, el escritorio estaba muy rallado y poco cuidado y por ultimo entiendo que el hotel esta situado en una gran avenida, pero los cristales estaban sucios, deberían limpiarlos mas menudo para que la luz entre mejor y mas brillante.

En la piscina no había servicio de bar aunque estaba indicado, y es incomodo tener que bajar de la planta 6 a la 1 para conseguir una cerveza....

El servicio de los camareros de la terraza espectacular, se portaron fenomenal con nuestro bebe, sobre todo un chico joven con una sonrisa preciosa y super agradable, (que pena que no me acuerdo del nombre!) y una chica venezolana, nos hicieron sentir siempre super agusto y muy bien atendidos.

A pesar de sacarle punta al hotel como lo he hecho, definitivamente volvería, pero reto al director a estar mas pendiente de los pequeños detalles, ya que eso es lo que hace a un hotel 5 estrellas. El hotel no es barato y por eso la gente paga esos precios para tener atenciones excepcionales.",4,2016,06,24
13,Terraza muy agradable! ,"El hotel es impresionante, una decoración interior espectacular, aunque la terraza no esta a la altura de la decoración interior. La terraza es agradable, pero el mobiliaris exterior no esta al nivel de la decoración interior del exterior. Es una decoración muy básica en relación a otras terrazas del mismo nivel. Gin tónic (ginebra 209) con tónica schweppes clasica  (no hay alternativa a otras tónicas) 12€ vino blanco (El Perro Verde) 6€.. El vino un poco caro, comparando con el Gin Tonic. Eso si, una terraza muy tranquila...",4,2016,06,11
13,Solo para gente de bien,"Hotel con clase, atención de nivel, habitaciones grandes y terraza muy buena. Es de esos hoteles donde vas a relajarte lejos de las grandes cadenas con cientos de huéspedes.
La piscina de arriba es pequeña pero esta bien para el centro de la ciudad",5,2016,06,08

13,Perfektes Hotel,"Ein tolles modernes Hotel in einem phantastischen historischem Gebäude. 
Sehr freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Egal ob am Empfang, Restaurant oder der Bar.
Die Zimmer sind modern ausgestattet. Bad mit Wanne. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Balkon, wobei der Blick nicht besonders attraktiv ist. 
Auch ein Besuch der Bar oder des Restaurants ist wirklich zu empfehlen. Alles ist auf sehr hohem Niveau. Eine Oase in der pulsierenden Stadt.",4,2016,05,31
13,Recomendable...!,"Ambiente muy agradable para tomar algo en buena compañía en la terraza. Ahora con el buen tiempo muy recomendable! Estuve con unas amigas tomando algo y el trato de los camareros la verdad es que fue inmejorable, muy amables y súper atentos! ",5,2016,05,28
13,Stile e personalità,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questo bellissimo hotel per due notti. Accogliente, elegante, moderno e molto vicino al centro della cittá. Il personale é molto gentile e professionale. L'arredamento richiama con numerosi dettagli il nome dell'hotel (cotton house). Le stanze sono bellissime e si può godere dell'ottima colazione in terrazza o nella sala principale. Per un po di relax l'hotel é dotato di una piscina, di una spa, una palestra e di una bellissima biblioteca. Inoltre, all'interno dell'hotel, essendo stato originariamente un'industria tessile, c'è la possibilitá di scegliere il tessuto e il taglio per farsi cucire una camicia su misura. Esperienza fantastica e da ripetere quanto prima.",5,2016,05,27
13,Magnifico hotel,"Es un hotel tipo Boutique muy bien situado cerca de Paseo de Gracia. El hotel es muy muy bonito. Pequeño, agradable y con un gran numero de espacios comunes. Buen servicio y una atención exquisita. Sin lugar a dudas volveremos!!",4,2016,05,27
13,Comida amigas,"Estuvimos un grupo en la terraza. Terraza espectacular!!!
Cócteles buenisimooossss!!!
Estuvimos muy a gusto!!
Me encanto el arroz y las croquetas.
Está todo Cuidado hasta el último detalle.
Muy recomendable tanto para grupos como parejas.",5,2016,05,23
13,"El mejor servicio, la mejor atención","No suelo utilizar Trip Advisor para hoteles, pues suelen ser una comoditie. Pero lo que he vivido hoy en el hotel es digno de mención. Hacía mucho tiempo que un hotel no me sorprendía por la exquisitez del trato, la voluntad de querer hacerlo bien, y las ganas de querer sorprenderte. Realmente le doy un 10 con mayusculas a todo el personal, pero sobre todo a Jandro que ha demostrado ser un conserje excepcional.",5,2016,04,25
13,Hervorragendes Hotel für einen Stadttrip,"Die Zimmer im Cotton House Hotel sind relativ klein aber für einen Städtetrip absolut ausreichend. Beim Check-In waren die Mitarbeiter sehr zuvorkommend und kurz nach Ankunft aus dem Zimmer wurden wir telefonisch kontaktiert, ob auf dem Zimmer alles zur Zufriedenheit sei.
Das Hotel ist vollkommen stimmig auf das Konzept ""Cotton"" ausgerichtet und die Einrichtung passt sich ebenfalls hervorragend in das Konzept ein. 
Das Personal war stets höflich, zuvorkommend und um unser Wohlergehen bemüht.
Das Frühstück war sehr reichhaltig, abwechslungsreich und qualitativ hochwertig.
Da unsere Reise mit Punkten aus der Marriott Rewards Programm absolviert wurde, kann ich zum Preis-Leistungsverhältnis keine Aussage treffen.
Einen kleinen Abzug gab es dafür, dass wir ein Zimmer zum Innenhof hatten und das Fenster aufgrund der Lautstärke der Lüftung nachts nicht offenbleiben konnte. Bei der Sauberkeit sind auch kleinere Abstriche zu machen, da die Reinigung des Bades während unseres Besuchs nicht immer absolut makellos war, hier geht es jedoch lediglich um kleiner Feinheiten wir Haare in der Dusche oder auf dem Boden. ",4,2016,03,28
13,Excelente,"Un excelente hotel 5 estrellas que anteriormente fue una fabrica de algodón, muy bien restaurado, un restaurant maravilloso, unas tapas de primera, la atención así como en el front desk, conserjería y camareros del restaurant fueron de maravillas, la habitación que nos toco fue muy cómoda con un pequeño balcón, para mejor la excelente ubicación muy cerca de la plaza y de muchas atracciones.",5,2016,03,22
13,Tolles Hotel in BCN,"Das Cotton House hat uns mega gut gefallen. Einrichtung ist sehr originel und einzigartig. Frühstücksbuffet war sehr einladend und gut. Zimmer ebenfalls 1A! Personal sehr freundlich, im Sall jedoch manchmal etwas langsam. Aber auf jeden Fall sehr zu empfehlen!",5,2016,03,22
13,Der Fünfsterne nicht im Ansatz würdig,"Die wohl schlechteste Fünfsterneerfahrung seit langem! Hier passt Anspruch und Realität nicht im Ansatz zusammen! Kleinste Minizimmer, wohin man schaut angeschlagenes Mobilär und alles macht einen abgewohnten Eindruck! Nach außen will man den Schein erwecken ""Hui"" aber leider nach hinten ""Pfui""! Der Service ist unfreundlich und nicht Kundenorientiert!
Nie wieder .....!",1,2016,03,17
13,Es la mejor opción en Barcelona,"Estuve por tercera vez en el Cotton House el pasado mes de Febrero. Como siempre todo fue excelente. Al llegar el portero del hotel, Reyes, que es excelente. Nos dio la Bienvenida con la alegría y entusiasmo que caracteriza a un buen Dominicano, como Reyes. Luego en el Restaurante y durante toda la estadía, Angelo, Alex y Laura nos atendieron excelente. La comida es muy buena y la calidad del hotel y servicio en todas las areas es inigualable. Es sin duda alguna mi casa en Barcelona. Su ubicación, a pocos pasos de la plaza Cataluña es muy conveniente.",5,2016,03,13
13,Almuerzo de trabajo en Cotton House Barcelona,"Bien ubicado y muy bonito. El servicio es amable y la calidad de la comida es muy buena. Esta construcción fue sede del gremio de los algodoneros. En un salón especial se puede solicitar camisas a la medida con mostrarios de puños, cuellos y botones. La capacidad de explicación y solución frente a imprevistos puede ser mucho mejor, al igual que la velocidad en el servicio",4,2016,03,13
13,Excelente!,"Laura y Angelo, en Batuar sin duda los mejores!! Aleé también del resturante todo un personaje, Reyes el botones no pierde la alegría dominicana. 
El restaurante es muy muy bueno, pero traten de ir durante el almuerzo porque el servicio es mucho mejor. 
",5,2016,03,03
13,Impecable experiencia,"Estuvimos alojados con mi marido en el hotel durante tres días. La ubicación es muy céntrica, práctica para llegar caminando a muchos lugares. La atención del personal fue excelente, nos recibieron con bebidas y dulces, nos explicaron como movernos por la ciudad y sugirieron actividades. Recibimos un upgrade de cortesía, por lo que la habitación era preciosa, con amenities de calidad. El desayuno era fabuloso y muy variado, pudimos cenar en el restaurant y nos sugirieron las mejores tapas que tuvimos mientras visitamos Barcelona. Contaban con una encantadora terraza. Muy recomendable.",5,2016,02,23
13,Zentrale und praktische Lage & stilvolle Einrichtung & nettes Personal,"Sehr praktisch und zentral gelegenes Hotel. Von der Endstation des Aerobusses erreichten wir es in 10 Minuten zu Fuss und auch zum Hafen und allen wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten konnten wir bequem spazieren. Nur zum Park Güell war es doch etwas anstrengender aber machbar (1 Stunde). Aus dem Zimmerfenster sahen wir sogar die Türme von Sagrada Familia.
Die stilvolle Einrichtung mit vielen schönen Details entsprach meinen Vorstellungen beim erstmaligen Lesen des Hotelnamens ""Cotton House"". Das Bett war schön gross, die Matratze bequem, die Bettwäsche stilvoll und perfekt sauber (siehe auch Foto). Die Fensterscheiben isolierten gut vom Strassenlärm. 
Direkt im Eingangsbereich des Zimmers war auf einer Seite das Waschbecken zwischen zwei Schränken und auf der anderen Seite ein separates WC, ein grosser Spiegel und eine grosse Dusche, welche den ganzen Raum neben der Badewanne ausfüllte. Der Eingangsbereich mit den sanitären Anlagen war mit einer Schiebetür von dem Schlafzimmer abgetrennt. Sowohl die Armaturen wie auch die Fugen waren im ordentlichen Zustand, obwohl nicht so perfekt, wie in Schweizer Hotels.
Praktisch und gut: Bügelbrett, Bügeleisen, Haarföhn mit zwei Aufsätzen und nicht fest angeschlossen, Nespresso-Maschine, beleuchteter Schminkspiegel, Bademäntel (siehe Fotos), WLAN kostenlos.
Das Personal war hilfsbereit, effizient und sehr positiv eingestellt.",5,2016,02,22
13,Exclusivo sitio para reuniones,"Organicé allí la cena de empresa, y nos prepararon una sala privada con una decoración muy peculiar. Aparte de la exclusividad, el servicio y la comida acorde al sitio. Tiene una terraza que no se imagina nadie en el corazón de Barcelona, que para los fumadores es muy apreciada. ",4,2016,02,14
13,comida celebracion evento familiar,"hice una reserva para una comida de 20 personas y otra para una cena de 14 porque el hotel y su decoracion es espectacular; el servicio del restaurante tambien fue sensacional y todos los invitados ""alucinaron"" con el hotel, su decoración y su magnifica terraza",4,2016,02,12
13,Uno de los mejores sitios,Lo cierto es que cuando tengo ocasión voy a pasar una noche a este espléndido hotel siempre la cogida es muy cálida y cordial y si tienes la oportunidad de probar la carta del restaurante del hotel con minas la velada de una manera espléndida. Lo recomiendo,4,2016,02,11
13," Una joya en Barcelona!","Con la espontaneidad característica de llegar à una ciudad y creer que hay hoteles disponibles fue para mi una  sorpresa ver que en Barcelona esto no es así y claro es una ciudad maravillosa y un destino turístico importante aún más para el fin de año.
De esta manera y  buscando un hotel central  llegamos casualmente al Cotton House y vaya  sorpresa al ver que este Hotel es una hermosa obra de arte y cada detalle en el es pensado y hecho con amor.
Es un hotel perfectamente ubicado, realmente cómodo y sofisticado: las camas son literalmente nubes de algodón haciendo honor a su nombre.
El mejor hotel boutique en el que me he hospedado en España con una historia y diseño únicos que realzan el carácter artístico  de Barcelona.
El personal que es para mi esencial sencillamente 1A👌. ",5,2016,01,29
13,Acogido entre algodones,"Hace más de ocho años estuve en este edificio por motivos profesionales cuando todavía no era un hotel, así que solo entrar me sorprendió grata y positivamente la transformación del edificio. Decorado espectacularmente con la temática y los olores que te transportan a otro sitio.
El trato recibido ha sido espectacular en especial agradecimiento a nuestra Assistant Gossypium Manager Olga Monje que nos trató des del primer momento cómo si estuviéramos en nuestra casa. Nos sorprendieron con pequeños detalles que no desvelaré por si nunca queréis ir.
Las habitaciones perfectas, camas cómodas y grandes todo cotón auténtico, hacía tiempo que no descansaba tan a gusto!!
El restaurante creo que es el punto de mejora, el servicio fue correcto y amable pero los platos tardaban en llegar, aquí el único punto flaco que le vi. El almuerzo espectacular por la variedad, la calidad y la cantidad.
Recomendable al 100% si lo que tenéis ganas de estar en un ambiente de calidad y tranquilo en el centro de Barcelona.
Muchas gracias Cotton House Hotel, ha sido un fin de semana perfecto.",5,2016,01,21
13,Cena y noche de descanso,"Excelente!!!! Todo el equipo del Hotel te garantizan una estada inmejorable: personal atento, discreto, amable sin excederse. Mención especial al personal de recepción, entre ellos Olga, quién no dudo en ofrecernos en todo momento su atención y dedicación. El hotel posee una vistas muy particulares a una de las manzanas del ensanche de la ciudad, que hacen el deleite de cualquier barcelonino. 
La cena en el restaurante Baluard también genial, tanto por la comida como por el trato de sus empleados, aunque solo podríamos pedir un poco más de celeridad a la hora de servir las mesas.",5,2016,01,20
13,Sensacional,"Estuvimos desayunando en el hotel y recibimos un trato exquisito. El buffet espectacular, mucha variedad y calidad de los productos. Te recomiendo tomar una café en la terraza. Felicidades a todo el equipo",5,2016,01,13
13,"Genial el bar, la terraza...","Lugar ideal para una copa tranquila pre o post cena. El bar de la primera planta y su terraza son ideales. Ambiente agradable, envolvente y elegante. El personal de lo mas atento y amable. La terraza integrada perfectamente con el diseño del tipico patio del eixample barcelonés, da continuidad a la elegancia del interior
Sin duda 100% recomendable",5,2016,01,09
13,Wunderbar!,"Eines der besten Stadthotels in dem wir waren!! 
Wir waren über Silvester im Cotton House und sind rundum begeistert gewesen: das Hotel alleine ist schon eine Reise wert!! Die Ausstattung ist sensationell, ständig entdeckt man neue Details. Alleine der Eingangsbereich und die Treppe in den ersten Stock (Concierge, Restaurants, Bar, Terrasse) ist überwältigend. Die Böden, die Decken, die Dekoration - einfach super. Auch der Service läßt nicht zu wünschen übrig. Über den Concierge haben wir uns ein Restaurant empfehlen lassen: die Bestätigung der Reservierung sowie eine google map mit dem Weg dahin haben wir kurz darauf auf das Zimmer bekommen, und die Empfehlung war sehr gut. Unser Zimmer war im 4. Stock mit Blick in den Hinterhof und damit relativ ruhig. Die Ausstattung ist sehr gut, das Bad angenehm groß. Das Frühstück ist vielfältig, da bleibt kein Wunsch offen. Das Restaurant mit der Bar in der Mitte bieten auch wieder etwas für das Auge. Der Service ist auch hier schnell und gut. Und ein Cocktail oder Wein in der Bibliothek bei angenehmer Launch Musik hat unsere Tage abgeschlossen. Die Lage ist sehr zentral nahe dem Pasteig de Gracia.",5,2016,01,09
13,Una experiencia incomparable,"Estuvimos una noche en este hotel aunque somos de Barcelona y la verdad es que nunca nos habíamos alojado en un sitio igual. Desde que entras te llega el delicado olor del Cotton, la recepción está decorada con mucho gusto y además el personal que nos atendió, en especial Paula, fueron muy agradables y serviciales. 
¿Qué se puede decir de la habitación? Los detalles cuidados a la mínima, el equipo de Gossypium una maravilla. Nos dejaron un mensajito personalizado en el espejo de bienvenida. Además, desde el colchón hasta las toallas son de una calidad increíble. 
No cenamos en el hotel, pero sí que desayunamos. ¡Madre mía vaya festín! Tenían de todo y lo que pudimos probar (para no explotar!) estaba delicioso. 
Así que recomiendo que si queréis ir a un hotel donde el trato sea especial y además deleitaros por su belleza, os acerquéis al Cotton ;)",5,2015,12,15
13,Gran hotel y Gran atención,"No llegué a hospedarme, tan sólo acudí a una cena organizada. Tanto el hotel como la atención y la comida fueron realmente excelentes. La terraza fantástica en donde sirvieron los entrantes. La antigua biblioteca se adecuó con una gran mesa que permitió que todos los comensales puediésemos hablar entre nosotros. Copas en el bar de alta calidad y luego, a las más ""golfas"" nos permitieron quedarnos en el salón hasta altas horas de la noche.Repito, el lugar es exquisito y todos los camarero/as extraordinarios al igual que la comida. No puedo hablar de precio porque fui invitada, pero merece la pena darse un capricho en un lugar tan antiguo y especialmente cuidado.",5,2015,12,15
13,"Almorcé en el  restaurante del hotel, un espacio único","El hotel, un edifico clasico recientemente renovado es expectacular, preciosos, elegante y con toques deco...sinceramtne unos de los lugares mas hermosos en los que he estado ultimamente. El restaurante cuanta on varios salones donde poder tomar un te o un cava...y una terraza preciosa.",4,2015,12,14
13,Muy agradable! ,"Hoy hemos venido a tomar postre y café a este precioso hotel cerca de casa. El interiorismo de Lázaro Rosa Violan saca gran partido a la arquitectura burguesa original
Unas rocas de chocolate muy buenas en un entorno de gusto exquisito
Con una terraza en el patio de manzana donde tomar algo super mona y desde donde veo mi casa...",5,2015,12,13
13,Agradable descubrimiento ,"Precioso espacio, perfectamente decorado, incorporando la modernidad al clasicismo propio del lugar, buen servicio,terraza decorada con gusto y estupendo restaurante. Muy buena relación calidad precio. ",4,2015,12,08
13,Gran hotel y mejor atención,"Estuve con mi pareja la semana pasada haciendo noche en Cotton House, y la verdad es que fue todo un acierto. El hotel es un edificio rehabilitado del siglo XIX, y en la reforma han respetado elementos del edificio original, manteniendo así el encanto. El desayuno es flipante, mención especial para los embutidos, y el personal muy atento.
Además, la ubicación es muy buena.",5,2015,11,28
13,Ganas de agradar !!,"Fui a cenar con mi mujer al restaurante Batuar y pasamos una velada expendida. Lo primero que hay que destacar es las ganas de todo el personal de que el cliente se sienta bien tratado desde el mismo momento que pasa por la puerta, y se agradece, ya que el servicio es uno de los grandes olvidados en estos tiempos. El marco es precioso, muy cuidado, hasta el más mínimo detalle. Mi única crítica, con ánimo de ser constructiva, es que la carta es un guiño claro hacia el turista, pero si Batuar quiere llegar a ser un restaurante de referencia en Barcelona, ha de hacer una carta más sobria. A las tapas se las puede llamar de otra manera, sin perjuicio de que haya algunas de ellas francamente buenas. La materia prima es muy buena, el ritmo del servicio más que correcto e, insisto, el servicio muy atento, con personal joven con ganas de hacer las cosas bien. Buen proyecto que deberá ir puliéndose poco a poco para seguir creciendo. Felicidades y a seguir con atención este proyecto de excelencia y servicio.",5,2015,11,28
13,Buenísimo,"Nos encantó este hotel, te sientes transportado a los años cincuentas.  Está super bien remodelado, pensado hasta en el último detalle.  Tiene un bar y una terraza muy agradables así como la biblioteca.  No le falta nada, el desayuno es muy completo.",5,2015,11,16
13,Business owner,"Me encanto el hotel, muy elegante, el trato y el servicio de primera, todos muy amables.
Los cuartos son muy comodos y tienen un gran servicio, cada rato entran a arreglar el cuarto, te ponen aguas cada vez,con un servicio y cuidado al cliente fenomenal! 
La regadera de las mejores y mas comodas que he visto! 
La ubicacion es excelente en uno de los mejores barrios de Barcelona!

Increibles cocteles!!😍😍 no se pueden perder la ocasion de provar los cocteles y los postres en este magnifico lugar lleno de encanto y perfecta decpracion!!",5,2015,11,03
13,Excelente Ubicación y Comida,"Fuimos al Cotton House hotel la semana pasada y les cuento nuestra experiencia.
Al llegar nos recibió Carolina. Una estudiante de Suiza (Lugano). El servicio que nos brindo fue excelente al tal extremo de bueno que como el maletero estaba en su hora de almuerzo, ella nos fue a dejar el equipaje para que no esperaremos. Al check out también estuvo presente. 
En el Restaurante, Laura, Angelo, Carlos, Alex, super buenos y atentos. La comida muy buena. Las tapas un éxito. Recomiendo las Croquetas de faisán con trufa.
El unico inconveniente que tuvimos fue, teniendo el letrero de no molestar, abrió alguien la habitación. No lo pudimos ver porque estábamos dormidos. Al comentarlo nos dijeron que nos darían una respuesta y nunca lo hicieron. Ama de Llaves tampoco es muy bueno. No al nivel del Restaurante. La ubicación del hotel es muy buena. Gran Vía a 300 metros de la plaza de Cataluña.",4,2015,10,29
13,Estadía de una noche antes de mi crucero por el mediterraneo.,"Un hotel excelente! Limpio, organizado, cómodo, empleados amigables, conservando un ambiente de glamour pero a la vez sencillo. Impresionado por lo generosos y la disposición de ayuda hacia los huéspedes. Cotton House Hotel altamente recomendable en BCN.",5,2015,10,27
13,Restaurante BATUAR,"Buenas noches. Quería dejar constancia de lo que ayer experimenté al entrar en el Hotel Cotton House. Fué poner el pie en la alfombra de la entrada y una sensación mágica se apoderó de mi. Una mezcla de magia, elegancia, distinción y afabilidad, que se mantuvo latente durante toda la noche, gracias a todas y cada una de las personas que nos atendieron. Un trato inmejorable, cercano, distinguido y entrañable, una profesionalidad infinita y una calidad exquisita en cada plato, en cada sorbo y en cada detalle. Ayer viví una experiencia única que jamás olvidaré. Gracias en mayúsculas a HIOMAR, Nuri, Neus, Alex Corso, Gabi y a Jonathan. Eternamente agradecida de corazón.",5,2015,10,25
13,Fui a cenar y muy bien!!!,"Estuve cenando con 3 amigos celebrando mi cumpleaños, el servicio muy atento, los platos muy ricos la decoración muy bonita y el ambiente muy agradable sobre todo la terraza en verano, lo único la carta de vinos un poco corta pero en general todo muy bien. Recomendable 100x100. ",4,2015,10,21
13,Cinco estrellas justas,"Este hotel sería muy bueno o incluso excelente si tuviera la categoría y precio de cuatro estrellas.
Con cinco estrellas y a 600 euros noche se queda en la media, o media baja.
Las zonas comunes son especiales, muy bien decoradas, y con ambiente especial.
Pero para eso basta con ir a tomar una copa, porque además sirven bien y con calidad.
Las habitaciones son pequeñas, y los baños parecen viejos sin serlo,  con baldosas que parecen sucias.
La puerta de la habitación no cerraba bien y las perchas eran muy diversas y algo escasas.
Los desayunos normales.
Y el servicio aún muy verde en general. Las maletas me las tuve que bajar porque nadie atendía el teléfono, cierto que era hora punta de salida.
En resumen, mejor Casa Fuster, la Florida, o Majestic",3,2015,10,19
13,Esplendido,"Un gran descubrimiento en la Gran Via de Barvelona. Un restaurante cinco estrellas en todo,local,  trato y comida.Menu ejecutivo por 25€ con calidad precio insuperable y cambia cada semana.

13,GRACIAS POR UNA EXPERIENCIA INOLVIDABLE,"El mes pasado nos alojamos en el Hotel Cotton House con motivo de nuestro 25 aniversario de boda. 

La experiencia fue absolutamente sorprendente y superó de largo nuestras expectativas.

Desde el primer momento en que llegamos a la puerta Gabriel nos recibió por NUESTRO NOMBRE!! Rubén, muy amable nos hizo el Check In y se encargó de organizar el hecho de que otra persona nos hiciera un detallado tour por el hotel y nos explicara la historia de este maravilloso hotel histórico. El personal estaba al corriente de la ocasión tan especial que veníamos a celebrar, lo que nos sorprendió y a la vez agradecimos enormemente, ya que diferentes empleados nos felicitaron varias veces durante nuestra estancia. Todo el personal fue muy amable y cercano, intentando en todo momento cuidar cada uno de los detalles para que la ocasión fuera perfecta e inolvidable. 

La verdad es que cuando uno ve el edificio desde fuera no puede llegar a imaginarse la posibilidad de encontrar este tesoro como tal escondido en la ciudad de Barcelona. Sin duda al entrar al hotel, tienes la sensación de estar entrando a una casa típica del siglo pasado donde a parte de percibir un ambiente fresco, joven y renovado, el personal es simplemente EXTRAORDINARIO. Están siempre sonriendo, se puede percibir como la gente que trabaja ahí lo hace por gusto y que disfrutan cuidando a sus huéspedes como si fueran sus propios invitados. 

Solo puedo agradecer enormemente a TODO EL EQUIPO DEL COTTON HOUSE, su esfuerzo y plena dedicación para hacer esta estancia una experiencia absolutamente inolvidable y entrañable de nuestras vidas.  

Sin duda recomendaría este hotel a todo el mundo, encontrarán un staff que les va a ayudar en todo lo que pidan y más.",5,2015,10,09
13,"Cotton House Barcelona, calidad, seriedad y atención excelentes.","Para empezar, el servicio de consergeria y botones excelente: recibimiento agradable, atento y de calidad. Te hacen un tour del hotel si lo deseas. Las instalaciones fascinantes, gran decoración conbinando clasicismo y modernidad(rehabilitación de una antigua fábrica de algodón barcelonesa). La restaruración fantàstica, precio y calidad proporcionado. La proximidad al centro de esta gran ciudad, passeig de Gràcia con el tour  modernista de Gaudi con la Casa Batlló, la casa Milà, las tiendas más lujosas y de calidad, la calidad de la restauración, la proximidad a las Ramblas, puerto de Barcelona, etc. Vale la pena. Calidad Marriot.",5,2015,10,05
13,Perfecto Hotel,"Me he hospedado en este precioso Hotel lamentablemente muy corto ;(!!! Felicito mucho a todos los trabajadores y a dirección! Ya que el
hotel es perfecto pero el servicio es aun mas importante y es impecable! 
Hay muchos practicantes que son muy amables y ayudan en lo que sea!! Lo que mas me encanto fue Gossypium nunca había encontrado en un Hotel un departamento mas completo!! 
Felicidades ya que el Hotel es tan nuevo pero tan profesional! Volveré muy pronto y lo recomiendo a todos

",5,2015,09,28
13,"Excelente experiencia, recomendado 100%","Hacía tiempo que me habían comentado que tenía que ir un día su fabulosa terraza, que al parecer ahora es el sitio de moda de Barcelona, así que decidí ir a comprobarlo por mi misma, tenía las expectativas muy altas y no me decepciono para nada, todo al contrario, quede fascinada. 
La decoración del hotel es sinónimo de elegancia y clase, pero al mismo tiempo, moderno y acogedor, me sentí como en casa. 
Para ésta primera vez, decidí ir a tomar un cocktail en la fantástica terraza chill-out, el servicio inmejorable, me recibieron los conserjes y me dieron la benvenida, y seguidamente, una de sus camareras, Julie, me aconsejo sobre que cocktail se ajustaría más a mis deseos. Al final, me decidí por tomar ''8 RÍOS'', tengo que decir que me encanto, estuvo exquisito, mi acompañante tomó un ''Gossypium'' y también estuvo fantástico. 

Por todos estos motivos, quería compartir mi experiencia porque creo que es un lugar que tiene que ser conocido por todo el mundo. Para la próxima vez, tenemos claro que además de tomar un cocktail, cenaremos allí, y espero hospedarme algún día.

Un saludo a todo el equipo que se esforzó para que mi acompañante y yo tuviéramos una velada inolvidable.",5,2015,09,23

13,¡Lugar encantador!,"Hotel precioso en el centro de la ciudad, con un servicio cinco estrellas!! Decorado con mucho gusto, en especial la ""library"" y el ""atelier"" situados ambos en la planta noble, junto al Restaurante Batuar. Es una obra de arte! Y el equipo humano es fantástico, siempre atentos y dispuestos a hacerte la estancia más agradable en todo momento. Felicitaciones al equipo directivo por tan magnífico trabajo! Volveremos seguro!!",5,2015,09,23
13,Fantástico hotel en el centro,"Tras leer varios artículos en prensa y comentarios de amigos y conocidos nuestros, quisimos vivir la Experiencia Cotton House en primera persona. Hemos quedado encantados! El edificio ha sido conservado y restaurado con mucho gusto. Especialmente la primera planta donde se encuentra el restaurante y la terraza, y una biblioteca preciosa con los techos originales del siglo pasado. Las habitaciones han sido decoradas elegantemente, siempre manteniendo la temática del algodón. El servicio es excelente, desde el botones que te da la bienvenida en la puerta del hotel con una sincera sonrisa, pasando por el equipo de recepción y consergeria, hasta el equipo de Batuar. No dejéis de probar el Pisco Sour, de los mejores que he probado nunca (y soy chileno!). En definitiva es un hotel recomendable al 100%.",5,2015,09,22
13,Ristorante - Buono in una splendida cornice,"Il ristorante si trova all'interno di un edificio meravigliosamente recuperato e ristrutturato, originariamente sede centrale di una Società tessile specializzata nella lavorazione del cotone, oggi Hotel.
Merita una visita anche solo per bersi qualcosa dopo cena.
Abbiamo mangiato bene, ma la cucina non raggiunge dei livelli di eccellenza.
Gli antipasti erano buoni, la carne abbastanza, i dolci forse inventati da qualcuno non proprio esparto dei dessert (le combinazioni degli ingredienti e la preparazione erano discutibili).
Dopo cena ci siamo gustati, secondo la tradizione spagnola, un buon gin tonic.
Il ristorante dispone anche di un terrazzo all'aperto, riscaldato alla sera con dei ""caminetti"".
I camerieri sono molto gentili ma il servizio è un po' lento.
Fateci un giro !",4,2015,09,22
13,Un lugar con mucho encanto,"Decidimos ir a comer a cotton house, primero tomamos algo en su  terraza y después fuimos al comedor.
La decoración es preciosa, fiel a las estructuras originales, es un lugar con mucho encanto.

Respecto a la comida, pedimos un menú degustación para dos personas, y todo estaba riquísimo y la presentación de los platos muy cuidada. La atención también fue exquisita.

No pongo 5 estrellas porque el precio de las bebidas me pareció excesivo. Cocacolas de 20 cl a 6€, y un martini 8,50€ (cuando la botella cuesta 7€).

De todos modos es un sitio muy recomendable !!

",4,2015,09,18
13,WOW!,"Das Hotel hat definitiv alles was es braucht! Wir kamen aus dem Staunen nicht mehr heraus. Die Zimmer sind grosszügig und sehr sauber. Auf der Terrasse fühlt man sich so richtig wie in den Ferien. Das ganze Personal ist geschult und versteht sein Handwerk. Ein riesiges Dankeschön an dieser Stelle an Alfredo, den Gossypium Manager, er hat während dem ganzen Aufenthalt dafür gesorgt, dass es uns an nichts fehlt. Gracias! Wer ein super Hotel sucht an bester Lage, ist hier genau richtig. Wir werden bestimmt wiederkommen!",5,2015,09,15
13,"Toll renoviertes Hotel, Zimmer für 300 Euro zu klein","Ich hatte ein Cotton-Room, d.h. ruhige Lage, Blick in den Innenhof, sportliche 299,50 Euro die Nacht.

Bedauerlicherweise war an Schlaf erst nach Anruf bei der Rezeption zu denken. Die lauten Gespräche im Innenhof erlaubten es nicht zu schlafen. Klingt spießig, aber nach 24 Uhr hört die Toleranz auf, wenn man am nächsten Morgen ein wichtiges Meeting hat.

Das Zimmer selbst ist schön, aber winzig klein. Sehr eigen ist die Integration des Waschbeckens in den kleinen Vor-Flur des Zimmers. Dafür sind Dusche und WC separat.

Personal sehr service orientiert, aber im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels ist der Preis für das Zimmer zu hoch - auch in Barcelona.",4,2015,09,13

13,LA ESENCIA DEL GLAMUR !,"Nos citaron ahi, un punto de encuentro como otro cualquiera, que no hubiese pasado a mi memoria si no llega a resultar una alegoría al buen gusto, elegante, cálido, en cada rincón  ""el esmerado cuidado de cada detalle"". 
Mencionar el excelente servicio !
Tanto nos gusto que repetimos la visita y fuimos a comer a la terraza, que no nos defraudo dadas las expectativas y la ilusion con la que fuimos.

No dejar de pasar a disfrutar... en todos los sentidos.
Enhorabuena a los responsables, la dirección y cada uno de los que ponen su esfuerzo para conseguir semejante resultado.",5,2015,09,01
13,"Hotel  buono,soprattutto per la posizione abbastanza centrale.","L'hotel si trova in una buona posizione per visitare la città e si presenta piuttosto austero nella sua eleganza...il primo impatto è stato negativo:sulla porta della stanza che ci era stata assegnata c'era scritto ""suite""...ma in realtà si trattava di una  normale stanza  ,con una finestra che si affacciava su un muro  vicino...Anche la pulizia ci è sembrata sommaria. La colazione ,invece,ottima. Comunque ci siamo trovati abbastanza bene,anche se  non abbiamo riscontrato     rapporto qualità-prezzo per un hotel 5 stelle...",3,2015,08,29
13,Grata sorpresa,"Entre sin saber y me fui con una grata sorpresa 
No llama mucho la atención desde la calle pero cuando entras cambias de opinión rapidamente
Elegante pero muy acogedor,servicio impecable y muy amigable
La terraza que es adonde ibamos muy agradable y lo mejor los combinados,espectaculares y con muy buen maridaje
Lugar muy agradable y elegante para encuentros de cualquier tipo",4,2015,08,29
13,Lujosa tradicion del algodon,Una casa burguesa del siglo diecinueve fue sede de los algodoneros el siglo veinte y ahora restaurada es el Cotton House Hotel. ofreccen un delicioso buffet de desayuno que pudimos degustar entre amigos luego de la visita al hotel. El edificio es precioso y la zona del desayuno ademas cuenta con una linda terrasa. La atencion esta orientada al cliente del hotel por lo que no siempre el personal habla español.,5,2015,08,24
13,Buen gusto!!!,"Un excelente opción para unos días en Barcelona. Finamente decorado, muy bien situado, excelente calidad en las comidas. Inmejorable servicio y la amabilidad de los empleados.
Terraza con muy buen ambiente. Es para repetir.",5,2015,08,11
13,"Nuevo, precioso y con un servicio impecable.","Estrenado hace relativamente poco, este hotel cuenta con una fantástica decoración y un servicio excelente. Tranquilo, agradable y limpio. Todo lo que puedes desear después de un día recorriendo las calles de Barcelona. El edificio y la temática sobre la que han jugado (la industria textil catalana) me parece un idea fantástica y elegante.  ",5,2015,08,10
13,Wir kamen kaum aus dem Staunen heraus,"Neu eröffnetes Hotel in sehr guter Lage. Fußläufig ist man innerhalb von 5 Minuten mittendrin. Check-in sowie Check-Out von der Schnelligkeit sicherlich verbesserungswürdig. Dafür aber sehr individuell und freundlich. Das Hotel selbst kann man fast schon als eigene Sehenswürdigkeit bezeichnen. Man kommt kaum aus dem Staunen heraus – überall bieten sich im Hotel geniale Fotomotive. Pool-Bereich auf dem Dach lädt zum Entspannen ein. Gleichzeitig genießt man einen herrlichen Stadtblick sowie auf die Sagrada Familia. Hier fehlt  allerdings z.B. ein Telefon um das Restaurant anzurufen – wir hätten z.B. gerne einen Cocktail / Drink bestellt. Die Zimmer waren wunderschön. Hier gibt es auch keinen Grund zum Klagen. Das Frühstück fanden wir gut – etwas zu „süß“, aber man konnte sich auch einzelne Sachen direkt aus der Küche ordern. Service war stets freundlich sowie sehr angenehm. Ich würde auf jeden Fall wiederkommen. Ein tolles, kleines Luxushotel mit 100%-Charme innerhalb einer genialen Kulisse, die sicherlich Maßstäbe setzt.",5,2015,08,06
13,Hotelazo,"Hotelazo en Barcelona. Impresionante reforma del edificio. Decoración por Lázaro Rosa Violán que ha creado otra obra de arte y ya firma los hoteles de moda de Barcelona (Cotton House) y Madrid (Only You)

Y lo mejor del hotel no es el edificio ni la decoración. Lo mejor el personal. La gente del restaurante y del bar encantadores. Nos explicaron y enseñaron toda la planta del bar y la biblioteca. El equipo de recepción superdispuesto a ayudar, y personalizando desde el minuto uno. Especial mención a Rubén que me llamó por mi nombre desde antes de empezar a interactuar con ellos.

Terraza con ambiente my tranquilo, respetando el descanso de los vecinos. Carta amplia y a precios muy ajustados.

¡Enhorabuena porque tienen un gran producto!",5,2015,08,02
13,MUY  BIEN,"Acudimos al restaurant Batuart  de dicho hotel y nos encontramos con una decoración
exquisita del ya archiconocido Lazaro Rosaviolán. Se reconoce de seguida su estilo pero aun así me sigue encantando cada lugar que frecuento reformado por el. En cuanto a la comida pedimos el menú del día y a pesar de su precio de 25 euros acabamos totalmente satisfechos tanto en cantidad como en calidad. El servicio excelente aunque un pelín lento. Recomendable",4,2015,07,28
13,Ideal,"Alguien nos habló del restaurante Batuar ubicado en este nuevo hotel así que decidimos reservar para cenar el pasado viernes. No pudo ser mejor recomentación. El hotel es maravillosamente encantador, desde el primer paso tienes la sensación de estar es otra época. El ambiente es absolutamente relajante. La cena fue exquisita, el trato perfecto, la terraza ( para el café o cocktel posterior ) fantástica. En resumen, totalmente recomentable para cena con amigos o romántica en pareja. Volveremos seguro.",4,2015,07,27
13,Espectacular!,"Precioso hotel construido en una histórica casona de la principal Avenida de Barcelona. Ubicado en una zona tranquila y cerca de todo. La atención y el servicio no podrían ser mejores. El personal, en general todos muy jóvenes, son muy atentos y cordiales. El comedor muy lindo con una terraza muy agradable. Al desayuno no le falta nada... totalmente recomendable!",5,2015,07,20
13,El algodon no engaña,"Ayer celebramos el cumpleaños de una buenisima amiga en la terraza del Cotton House y descubrimos el mejor servicio y la mejor decoración de Barcelona. El interior es simplemente sublime, de un gusto exquisito, y el servicio nos hizo sentirnos como reyes durante unas horas. Todo es arte alli dentro: la comida, las bebidas, la vegetación y hasta el aroma de la zona de la biblioteca. Tripadvisor tiene que aumentar las estrellas para dar cabida a este pedazo de regalo para los sentidos.",5,2015,07,20
13,Un fantástico hotel,"Sorprende que estando en el centro de la ciudad dentro del hotel el ambiente es muy relajado, tiene una decoración exquisita. La terraza del restaurante es fantástica, y el trato del personal estupendo, te sientes como en casa. Sin duda una gran hotel para recomendar y disfrutar.",5,2015,07,19
13,Extraordinario,"He pasado un fin de semana romántico en pareja.
Destaco la paz que transmite este hotel, tiene un ambiente único. Sorprende que a pesar de estar en el centro una vez dentro el ambiente sea tan relajante. 
La habitación muy amplia y limpia. La terraza del restaurante es espectacular.
No encontramos nada negativo durante nuestra estancia, además el trato del personal fue estupendo. Sin duda recomiendo este hotel, la relación calidad precio es altísima, ha cumplido todas mis expectativas.",5,2015,07,13
13,Precioso,"Ubicado en una preciosa finca, que primero fue residencia de una familia adinerada y después sede de los algodoneros de Barcelona, este hotel ha sido magníficamente puesto al día con el exquisito gusto del interiorista Lázaro Rosa Violan. Al magnífico entorno se suma el fantástico trato de los profesionales. Muy recomendable",5,2015,07,10
13,Buen hotel y muy elegante,"Para ser Barcelona una ciudad tan cosmopolita y con tanto movimiento, es difícil conseguir un lugar que lo invite a uno al relax como este. Ubicación excelente y un servicio de primera ... la mayoría de los clientes eran americanos. Buen servicio de conserjería tanto la biblioteca como las escaleras de acceso hablan de lo elegante de la edificación. Volveria aunque el precio es de tomar en cuenta  ...",5,2015,07,09
13,Perfecto,"He pasado un fin de semana aqui en pareja y sin duda este hotel ha cumplido sobradamente todas mis expectativas. La habitación en general muy cómoda y limpia, el personal es excelente.

13,Terraza imprescindible,Un hotel precioso de visita obligada. La decoración es espectacular y el ambiente único. La terraza es imprescindible y los cocktails buenísimos.Gran servicio y ubicación inmejorable. Con ganas de volver.,5,2015,06,30
13,Muy buen Hotel,"buen hotel , muy bien ubicado , a dos cuadras del paseo de gracia y de la plaza  , hotel pequeño , cuartos pequeños , cama muy cómoda , buen baño...lo justo pero bien puesto...no había ni espacio donde poner la maleta.",4,2015,06,23
13,"Sehr gut, mit Steigerungspotenzial","Wir logierten Anfang Juni für 3 Nächte im Cotton House. 
Das absolute Plus ist der Standort. Von der Plaza Catalunya (Endstation Aerobus) ist das Hotel in gut 5 Minuten zu Fuss erreichbar, d.h. kein Kofferschleppen durch die U-Bahnschächte. Zudem liegt es in der Nähe der U-Bahnstation Urquinaona, des Palau de la musica und des Paseo de Gracia. 
Innenarchitektonisch ist das Hotel ein Bijou, die Terrasse eine Wucht.
Der Empfang war sehr freundlich und persönlich.
Das Frühstück fanden wir nicht gerade günstig, es war aber jeden Cent wert.
Die Betten waren bequem und das Zimmer hübsch eingerichtet.

Abzug gibt es für:
- unser Zimmer. Das war winzig. Das Fenster ging zu einem Schacht, wodurch der Raum ziemlich düster war. Dafür hatten wir keinen Autolärm.
- Personal und Abläufe im Restaurant. Man merkt, dass das Hotel erst wenige Monate geöffnet ist. Die Abläufe wirkten zum Teil unkoordiniert. Zudem schienen einige eher unerfahrende Service-Mitarbeitende am Werk zu sein.  Das Personal war jedoch durchwegs sehr freundlich und gab sich grosse Mühe.

Fazit für uns: Ein gutes Haus an toller Lage. Wir werden das nächste Mal wohl ein Zimmer mit Balkon zum Innenhof buchen.",4,2015,06,17
13,Un oasis en la ciudad,"Increíble, es la palabra que más pronuncias cuando paseas por el hotel Cotton House.
Es increíble lo bien que has restaurado cada parte del edificio, lo respetuosos que son con las tradiciones de la construcción catalana, la belleza de los detalles, el silencio de sus habitaciones, la calidad de sus telas,.....
Desde la recepción, hasta la habitación, pasando por biblioteca, restaurante, terraza o piscina, todo merece la pena en este hotel.",5,2015,06,09
13,"Sehr schönes, zentral gelegenes Boutique-Hotel","Es war wirklich ein wunderbarer Aufenthalt für mich in Barcelona. Ich hatte ein Doppelzimmer zur Einzelbenutzung und wurde im 5. von insgesamt 6 Stockwerken untergebracht. Nachdem ich per mail vorab um ein ruhiges Zimmer gebeten hatte, bekam ich ein Zimmer zum Hinterhof, was wirklich deutlich ruhiger ist, i.V. zur Vorderseite. Zunächst war ich über das Bad, welches im Flur integriert ist, etwas erstaunt. Aber letztlich hat das nicht gestört. Die Einrichtung des Zimmers ist sehr hell und ansprechend. Der Balkon ist sehr nett, die Klimaanlage leise. 
Ich finde das Hotel sehr gut gelegen, da man es sowohl zu den Touristen-Attraktionen als auch zum Shoppen nicht weit hat. Das Personal ist äusserst freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Frühstück ist recht teuer, aber auch sehr gut. Wenn man günstiger frühstücken möchte, gäbe es in Laufdistanz viele Alternativen. Der Pool auf dem Dach ist sehr klein, aber für eine kurze Abkühlung ausreichend. Das Fitness-Studio habe ich nicht gesehen.
Der Concierge ist äusserst hilfsbereit und bemüht, alle Probleme zu lösen.
Alles in allem hat mir das Hotel sehr gut gefallen und ich würde dort wieder übernachten.",5,2015,06,08
13,muy recomendado,"Excelente hotel , muy buen disenio, habitaciones modernas y comodas, excelente restaurante, tanto en ambiente, como servicio y variedad y calidad de comidas. Buena ubicacion, lo mas destacable es la cordialidad y simpatia del personal.",5,2015,06,05
13,Excelente hotel,"Esta situado en el centro de Barcelona, C/ Gran Vía, entre plaza Tetuán y Paseo de Gracia. El hotel es clásico y moderno a la vez. 
Nos hicieron un upgrade a una suite por ser Marriott Platinum. La habitación nos encantó, así como todo el hotel en general. La cama del hotel, king size, era súper cómoda.
Su servicio es fantástico. Son todo gente joven, educada y sonriente.
El desayuno es muy bueno. Nos encantaron sobretodo los quesos, panes y pasteles. No tiene precio poder desayunar en la terraza fantástica que tienen.
Lo recomiendo al 200%.",5,2015,05,27
13,Fantástico hotel,"En el corazón de Barcelona, con personal super atento y agradable. Conseguí dos upgrades gratuitos. Eché en falta que la habitación fuera un poco más grande, pero tienen wifi de alta velocidad (imprescindible en los viajes de negocios). Lo mejor: el variado desayuno de buffet de alta calidad en su terraza. Seguro que repetiré",5,2015,05,25
13,SÚPER RECOMENDABLE,"Un oasis en el corazón de Barcelona. Cuidado hasta el último detalle. Servicio impecable. No te puedes perder probar los rissottos de alcachofa y calamares del Restaurante Batuar.

Bellissimo, elegante, fino nei minimi dettagli!Raffinato ma con quel senso di casa...con tanta storia alle spalle! 
Molto curato nel l'attenzione al cliente, il personale disponibilissimo ma senza strafare.

El hotel es precioso y el servicio, increíblemente atento. Todas las estancias tienen un aire sofisticado y muy elegante. La habitación que nos dieron era muy bonita, amplia, y la cama era muy cómoda. Tanto el hotel como la habitación están llenos de grandes detalles de calidad y cuidado.
El desayuno es fantástico, en una sala preciosa o en la terraza y con una selección de comida muy buena. La ubicación es muy buena, a cinco minutos andando de la Plaza de Cataluña y de dos paradas de metro. La piscina y el gimnasio son pequeños, pero suficientes para quien quiera hacer uso de ellos. El wifi funcionaba muy bien.
Es un hotel pequeño y muy elegante, perfecto para quienes valoren los detalles. Un gran hotel boutique.",5,2015,04,26
13,Una experiencia inesperada,"Un hotel muy elegante con una decoracion exquisita, mezcla de retro y vanguardiismo en los espacios comunes y minimalismo con muchisima clase y suavidad en las habitaciones. El servicio de nota y el buffet desayuno de vicio. Absolutamente recomendable para disfrutar de una experiencia mas alla del descanso.",5,2015,04,25
13,Inolvidable visita a BCN,"Desde que decidimos hacer un viaje corto de 2 días a BCN, todo fue perfecto. Buscamos utilizar nuestros puntos y encontramos este hotel nuevo. Pasamos dos noches perfectas en una Ciudad Increible, pero gran parte del éxito del viaje fue el Hotel CottonHouse. Es una gran combinación entre viejo y nuevo. El personal es de primera y sumamente cordial, especialmente el Sr. Gabriel Borrego. El Bar es muy acogedor y en general estamos invitados a regresar en corto plazo.",5,2015,04,19
13,Una experiencia única!,"Estuvimos alojados en este hotel el pasado fin de semana con mi marido y fue una experiencia genial. El personal es cordial, cercano y educado. 
Las instalaciones son fantasticas con un aire colonial muy acogedor. Puedes tomar un fantástico coctáil en el bar, la terraza o su biblioteca. La habitación es acogedora, llena de detalles. A nosotros nos dieron una con un pequeño balcón. 
El desayuno es fantástico, los zumos (naturales! de verdad), el pan (aún me acuerdo), la selección de frutas y los yogures muy muy buena. 
Una experiencia que, sin duda, recomendamos.",5,2015,04,16

Unbedingt ausprobieren!",5,2015,04,15
13,Hotel absolutamente recomendable!!!,"El Cotton House es un magnífico hotel boutique en pleno centro de Barcelona. Todo en él (el personal, la decoración, el desayuno, la terraza, la piscina ...) es exquisito. Sin lugar a dudas un hotel muy recomendable.

El personal ha estado volcado en que nuestra estancia fuera lo mas agradable posible. Muchas gracias!!!",5,2015,04,13
13,En Barcelona entre algodones,"Este es el hotel perfecto para quien quiera hospedarse con todo lujo en Barcelona en pleno centro pero en un ambiente cálido, familiar, formando de alguna forma de parte de la historia de la ciudad y mimado por un equipo de profesionales del más alto nivel. Recuerda a uno de esos clubs británicos que salen en muchas películas... Muy recomendable. Y lo de entre algodones es absolutamente real... las sabanas, las toallas, los albornoces son del mejor algodón que se pueda adquirir en el mercado.",5,2015,03,29

Tiene su caracter peculiar en la decoracion, han tratado de conservar su estetica interior, los muebles, la biblioteca es enchantec. La habitacion king que tuvimos con vista hacia la calle via cort de cataluna tenia una vista muy agradable y no se preocupen por bullas pues las ventanas son doble vidrio y no se escucha nada . La habitacion tiene una decoracion espectacular con las Pinturas de las ramas de algodon , el detalle de estas en la cabecera de la cama pero en luces indirectas crean una atmosfera de relax, la ducha o area de bano es fabulosa; grande con la ducha desde el techo y la opcion de la ducha manual, al lado esta la tina de bano , es una area privada de el toilet tambien. Cada detalle esta a un nivel superb! Los desayunos en el comedor son deliciosos, el buffet ofrece productos organicos, granos , embutidos, pasteles gourmet, zumos frescos, cafe delicioso y la atencion de las asistentes es de primera. La terraza es una opcion para tomar el desayuno y puedes ver el lado antiguo de los edificios atras. El personal de recepcion esta para asistir en todo lo que son consejos del area, ver copias si deseas de adjuntos solo enviandolo al archivo . Mi hija y yo quedamos felices con este magnifico hotel y todo de el.",5,2015,03,10
