214,Best boutique hotel & stay,"One of the best boutique hotels with charm! We loved our stay. The staff were welcoming and warm. The food was delicious and we enjoyed a rainy evening, playing cards in the salon, while sampling the wine and charcuterie board. If you want a personalized visit, unique from the big box hotels, stay here! Much gratitude to Brenda, Elliot, Daniela, Anton and Shannon. We will be returning.",5,2024,09,30

214,Beautiful property in a great location,"Beautiful property in a very quite neighborhood , excellent guest service. Very elegant restaurant with good food. Rooms were very clean and pleasant.
Walking distance to  St Stephen's green and  center city and shops. We are  highly recommending this place.",5,2024,09,11
214,A ‘GEM’ in Dublin,"What can we say but WOW WOW WOW, myself & hubby have just returned from staying at this gem of a hotel, from the moment we arrived we were greeted by lovely reception staff , complimentary Gin & Tonic in the most beautiful setting on the patio…. Our room was comfortable and spotless, with excellent decor, beautiful touches like the tea cups (so cute) minibar with snacks, water everyday, coffee making facilities. Bathroom yet again spotless and the housekeeping staff done an amazing job of keeping the rooms spotlessly clean everyday. 
Clara in reception first class and very knowledgeable, and the Manager who was lovely friendly & helpful

We will definitely be back",5,2024,09,08
214,Charming Hotel,We love this hotel. The building and grounds are very charming. The staff has been very helpful and friendly. The rooms are comfortable and quiet. The entire hotel is immaculately clean. There’s interesting contemporary art throughout the property. It’s located in a great neighborhood and it’s close to the Grand Canal for an enjoyable stroll. The LUAS line is a short walk which makes getting around the city so convenient. We’d stay here again in a heartbeat—highly recommend!,5,2024,08,27
214,This hotel is special!,"A wonderful stay in this beautiful hotel. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Good location with the luas stop just around the corner. Spotlessly clean and comfortable, with little extras that make it even more special, gorgeous decor. Excellent breakfast.",5,2024,08,24
214,Absolutely exceptional,"My daughter and I stayed at The Wilder Townhouse as part of a trip to Dublin to celebrate her birthday. From the outset, the manager and staff went to great lengths to make her feel special.

We really enjoyed the stylish layout, with interesting props and original artworks throughout. Our room was very tastefully decorated, the beds were extremely comfortable and the shower was one of the best I have ever used.

The breakfast was exceptional, offering such a variety of options, including a few off menu things that I ordered to suit a specific dietary need.

I can't recommend this place enough. It's such a beautiful hotel with exceptional levels of service. First Class!",5,2024,08,14
214,Save time and money - stay in unattended lodgings instead,"Given that the Wilder is part of Small Luxury Hotels networks, we were in for two deep shocks. 

One - the space. The shower was the size of a coffin (not kidding); the room (small room) was the size of a shoebox. I do not want to guess what size their shoebox room is (they have one named that). 

Two - the personnel. I am sincerely wishing we'd stayed at a place that had no attendants at all. Asking about anything local was pointless (no knowledge). That was surprising for a SLH -designated property. Then, the fridge in the room - it only worked (was cold) when the key card was in. But even if we left one of the cards in for the day (after turning off the lights etc.), the housekeeping pulled it out! We even asked the front desk - maybe there was a way to keep the food cold - but the front desk insisted that the fridge worked as intended. The worst problem came when on the last day, we asked front desk to book us a taxi to the airport. The taxi came, but did not charge by the meter - the driver charged 51 Euro instead of 38, and said ""it's the hotel surcharge"". We were shocked, and complained. The General Manager then emailed and said that the hotel clerk used ""Freeway application"". He meant Freenow app?! The front desk at the hotel using it? I have it - I know about the surcharges - and I'd have called the taxi myself, using the landline, had I known that the front desk person doesn't know how to do that.",1,2024,08,05
214,"Great hotel, accommodating staff and comfortable rooms","The Wilder Townhouse was our first stop in Ireland and a great way to start a 3 week vacation. The rooms aren't large, but they're quite comfortable. Hotel staff are incredibly nice and accommodating as are the restaurant and bar staff. Everyone really wanted to make sure we were having a good time... and we were. Breakfasts (the only mean we had there) was great and the chef would do pretty much anything you wanted. We always ended up in the bar or veranda at the end of the day for some wine or, of course, a Guinness. It's not really centrally located, but if you're up for a bit of a walk, you can find yourself in the middle of the restaurant and bar area. We'd stay again for sure.",5,2024,07,03
214,Gem in Dublin -lovely stay!,"Lovely stay. Hotel was very clean, shower was terrific with excellent pressure, staff very helpful and friendly.  Rooms were well appointed with new furnishings and bed was super comfy. Breakfast delicious with lots of options. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here if we are ever in Dublin again.",5,2024,06,09
214,Lovely stay a chic boutique hotel,"Absolutely loved staying at The Wilder.  Peaceful and safe neighborhood, near canal with walking / biking path as well as gorgeous park at St. Stephen’s Green.  The public areas of the hotel are filled with beautiful art work and curios.  The rooms are truly “boutique” chic, very comfortable and spotless with complimentary Irish treats.  We booked 4 rooms and each was charming and unique. The breakfast buffet is complimentary and really perfect, but you can upgrade to larger full meals which were also delicious.  Easy 20-minute walk or light-rail ride to tourist area.  And the staff couldn’t be more helpful and friendly. Highly recommend this lovely hotel!",5,2024,06,04
214,Pristine and stunning; appointed with all the amenities and touches you could possibly desire,"I have stayed in a lot of places all over the globe, and in terms of uniqueness, stunning decor, amenities that go above and beyond, and staffing excellence, this is among the finest I have experienced.

The rooms are absolutely beautiful; the bathrooms have some of the best tile work you will find and have the highest quality soaps, shampoos, and amenities. Curated small batch snacks, coffee/Nespresso, tea, and refrigerated water are in every room and are included in the cost. The hotel offers a free gin and tonic that is among the best you will have, garnished with an assortment of fruits.

The staff are consistently outstanding, and they took care of us on both occasions that we stayed with them. We were eight adults in four rooms, and we stayed two nights at the beginning of our trip and one night at the tail end of our trip during the month of May 2024, and they treated us like royalty throughout. They could not have been nicer or more accommodating to us all!

Even if you do not have the opportunity to stay here, stop by and check out their stunning bar by the lobby. And if given the opportunity, put these accommodations at the top of your list!",5,2024,06,02
214,Full of charm and surprises,"This is a very special place! My son and I had separate ""shoebox"" rooms. While small, they were so nicely appointed and charming with tons of character including vintage built-in cabinets, stained glass windows, beautiful/histroic bathroom tilework, paired with modern furunishing and art work. The room was cozy but I could easily do floor work exercises so for one person or a couple without lots of luggage, the room is large enough. The beds was comfortable and the location is a quiet residential area making sleep easy! The breakfast was our best in 8 days touring all over Ireland and staying in other very nice hotels and inns. Lots of cold choices including fresh fruit and berries, to-order lattes, and a large hot item menu too. The complimentary gin and tonic on arrival and the snacks in the room were a welcome surprise.

The reason I'm writing the review is that the staff were the most welcoming and helpful of all the places we stayed in Ireland! From help with running route suggestions, arranging taxi's, directions to restaurants and an unrushed geniune hospitality with every encounter, the people make it a great experience! I hope to stay here again on a future trip.",5,2024,05,28
214,All in all a good stay,"The location was good for walking to most sites and an easy cab ride to those that were a bit further away. Quiet location with a nice patio area for enjoying a cocktail or cup of tea before heading out to dinner. 

The staff was wonderful and accommodating!! We enjoyed chatting with them and learning where they are from...spoiler alert...everywhere but Ireland.  The property did seem understaffed, though, and some of the employees were simply exhausted from working so much. They never complained, but you could definitely see and feel it.

Breakfast was wonderful each morning. A great start to the day. In the afternoon they had pastries available for a snack. The welcome G&T was a nice treat.

The downsize is definitely the room sizes. There were no drawers or anywhere to unpack. We were there for four nights and having our stuff all over the counters and floors of the small room got a bit much. The bathroom was so tiny you pretty much had to step into the bedroom to dry off from the shower.",4,2024,05,18
214,mini break in Dublin,"From the moment we entered the Wilder, it was an amazing experience from beginning to end.  We were checked in before 12 even though our check in was 3pm.  Our room had everything it could possible require. The bed was super comfy and the bedding was beautiful. Along with tea/coffee, a welcome tray with crisps, chocolate and granola bar.  A complimentary drink was also included in our stay
when we returned from dinner, our server Oscar brought us our drinks and spent a very enjoyable 10 minutes chatting to us. He was a pleasure to talk to, so interesting and friendly. 
Breakfast the following morning was absolutely gorgeous, a wonderful selection of breads, cereals, and then a beautiful cooked option, with plenty of choice.  I had the Kippers and scrambled eggs, my husband had the full Irish. Again Oscar was on duty and so professional. 
I would highly recommend this wonderful hotel, the location to public transport was perfect, within walking distance to all main areas. we will be back",5,2024,04,30
214,Calm and sophisticated,"We chose this hotel for a short break in Dublin and are so glad we did. It was an oasis of calm and yet just a short hop to the lively city centre. The hotel has been sympathetically converted and modernised and is in a lovely and distinctive old red brick building. It is conveniently located quite near to a couple of tram stops (one in each direction) which puts most parts of the city within easy reach. You can buy tram tickets which are valid for a few days from the ticket machines at the tram stops and work out to be worthwhile if you plan on doing a little exploring.

We were allocated a comfortable room with a large shower. There were lots of nice, luxury touches which we hadn't expected. We ate there on 4 evenings for lighter meals and the food was very good and reasonably priced. Other reviewers said breakfast was amazing and it was!

One of the best things was the staff who were all friendly and efficient and really made you feel so welcome. The manager was often present and took real pride in the service they offered - true hospitality!",5,2024,04,21
214,Exceptional property!,"Fantastic experience. Beautiful property. Exceptional service. Rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. Breakfast is classy and delicious. Quiet, restful sleep was glorious. Gym access down the street was great! Will return for a personal trip asap.",5,2024,04,09
214,Blown away!! Book this stay,"Everything about this stay has been incredible. From the minute we walked into the wilder we were welcomed by friendly staff and incredible service and a complimentary gin& tonic in the Garden room. We are absolutely blown away by how caring every staff member is and how gorgeous every clean, eclectic  inch of this Dublin hotel is. It’s cozy and a home away from home I didn’t know existed. Thank you so much for this experience",5,2024,03,02
214,Wild about the Wilder!!,"Stayed for 2 nights for the rugby. A very warm welcome from the ladies on reception who despite us being early let us check in to our room. This hotel is super chic with gorgeous decor. The room was spacious, the bathroom was stunning with a powerful shower. Range of complimentary toiletries and drinks/ snacks in the room. The beds were comfy, the rooms were quiet. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The breakfast was tasty with a long list of options for cooked and continental, all beautifully presented in a relaxed manner. The complimentary gin and tonic was also a nice touch. The staff were really what made our experience special. A turkish waitress who's name i forget (I think it started with E) couldnt do enough to help us, she was funny and charming, and keen to practice her english at every opportunity. She really is a gem in the hotel and obviously very happy in her job. Would highly recommend this place to stay, its worth the nightly rate for a comfortable, friendly stay.",5,2024,02,25
214,Great couple of days away,"We found the staff so lovely and helpful - we were offered an upgrade on arrival also a complementary G&T in the cosy bar. 
The breakfast was gorgeous and they couldn’t do enough for us. 
Fabulous location within walking distance to all Dublin City tourist spots & restaurants. 
We will definitely return ! Thank you.
Julie",5,2024,02,12
214,Excellent stay at the Wilder Townhouse,"We spent 4 fabulous nights at The Wilder.   Our stay was made all the more fantastic by the staff,  in particular Ann who made every effort to make us feel welcome and special.  Would also like to thank Oscar for his patience with us after we lost our room card on several occasions!  The food was excellent in particular the choice at breakfast which was served by the very knowledgeable friendly staff.  A mention to Rachel's astonishing memory remembering all the orders without pen and paper!

Would highly recommend The Wilder for its staff, location, rooms etc I could go on and on.  It is just a great place to stay!",5,2024,02,01
214,Extremely clean and gorgeous low-frills hotel with exceptionally friendly staff.,"The Wilder is in a beautiful building with very nice details and design in the lobby, restaurant and rooms. The location is ideal if you are looking to avoid the noisy Temple Bar area but still be only a short walk or tram ride from the city center. The thing that was most exemplary from our stay was the staff at the desk and in the bar. I was traveling with my elderly parents, and the staff was very accommodating and patient with our requests, and everyone was very friendly and seemed to enjoy and take pride in their work and wanted to provide the guests with the best stay possible. The rooms were very comfortable and the bathrooms very spacious. The Wilder is a little light on amenities — theres no gym, sauna, or full restaurant — but the breakfasts and bar are very nice, so if you are ore inclined to get out into the city rather than stay in the hotel, it's a wonderful place with genuinely tasteful choices made in the decor, very high cleanliness standards and a truly lovely staff.",5,2024,01,05
214,Couples getaway ,"Fabulous place, room Was tiny though especially for the price, great location, although had to park out on the street as there isn’t a lot of parking spaces , breakfast was absolutely amazing. Staff were friendly, worth a visit ",4,2023,12,12
214,Could not have been nicer!,"Could not have been nicer! Lovely central location so able to walk most places. Very quiet. Beautiful decor. Very well appointed rooms, with powerful and hot showers.
The complimentary G&Ts were the topping ...",5,2023,12,04
214,Fabulous stay,"Lovely hotel, 10 min walk from St. Stephen’s Green. This is a small boutique hotel not far from the city centre. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We were able to park on the premises and walk into the city. The rooms are small but cosy and luxurious. Lovely warm atmosphere, with delicious food and drinks. Definitely recommend and will stay there again.",5,2023,12,03
214,Best Hotel In Dublin for Family and Friends,"The best boutique hotel in Dublin and among the best in Europe. Rooms are stunning and thoughtfully decorated, the ambiance first class and the service beyond incredible. Nothing is too much trouble, everyone is friendly and the quality of food and drinks is superb. We were in room 204 which was light and spacious, and if you ask very nicely the night receptionist might, just might, be able to get you a Guinness after hours (shhhh).",5,2023,11,26
214,Nice boutique hotel with small rooms,"Stayed here a few nights while in Dublin over the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.

Overall, a very nice stay.

Positives:
—Good location for Dublin, south of the river and away from the tourist throngs, but still within walking distance of many sights, restaurants, and bars.  Also, relatively close to St. Stephen’s Green (for exercise) and a tram stop.
—Stylish decor throughout the property, including particularly charming wallpaper.
—Thoughtful boutique hotel touches in the decor (e.g., interesting books in the room), including some cute holiday additions to the rooms (e.g., a stocking on a mantle, etc.).
—Excellent water pressure in the rain shower.
—Very nice bath amenities/products.
—Everything was sparkling clean.
—Attentive, helpful staff at every turn.
—Great sleep:   Easily adjustable room temperature, nice bedding, comfortable bed, very quiet hallways.
—“Townhouse” feel was elegant:  a nice driveway into the hotel, not a large number of rooms, no public or convention facilities at the hotel, etc.; all of this gave the property a residential feel.
—A welcome G&T was a nice touch!

Negatives:
—Rooms are VERY small.  We were in the category above the ‘shoebox’ rooms and the room was still on the small side, though the bathroom was roomy.  The smallness of the rooms means that they do not have closets; instead, there is a bar on the wall with a couple of hangers and a few sliding hooks.  While this may be suitable for a solo traveler, for a couple traveling for a few days (and perhaps changing clothes for nice dinners, etc.), it was not possible to really unpack.  The room also did not have any drawers.
—The breakfast room/bar, while very cute, is small, and probably too small for the volume seen in the morning.  The tables barely hold breakfast dishes, and the room with the buffet doesn’t have much room to actually navigate the buffet.  The breakfast buffet had quality items, but not a huge selection, as it is confined by the space.  The temperature in these rooms was also noticeably hotter than the hallways and lobby.

I would certainly return given the stylish accommodation, quality service, boutique feel, and good location, but be prepared for the small rooms (even by European standards).",4,2023,11,26
214,"Disappointing, very tiny rooms","The staff were all helpful and friendly. The shower was nice - a true drench shower head. They offered us early check in, which was nice. 

We had some cleaning issues on arrival. Namely: a jug of milk had been left in our room so long it had gone rotten, and it wasn’t taken away the second day either - we had to take it to reception ourselves; and the bathroom smelled really strongly of mould the first day and even had some mould growing on one of the walls. I wonder if maybe the room had been unoccupied for a while before we arrived and had grown stale with the bathroom door shut? Who knows, but we did not expect these issues from a SLH property. We sorted the milk ourselves (but we were never brought a replacement) and the bathroom aired out after leaving the extractor fan on for a few hours. The hotel gave us a bottle of wine as an apology when we raised these issues, which was appreciated and draws a line under things. 

Overall though we were still disappointed with the hotel because it simply didn’t meet our expectations from the advertising. 

The room was very small and nothing like the example photo on the website. We booked a ’Popular Twin Room’. On the website this room type has a wonderful little feature fireplace with a table and armchair, two built in bookshelves and a bright window. Ours had none of that. No original features, no side table with a big chair. Just space barely enough to fit the bed, a narrow desk that was completely taken up by the coffee service, and a window looking into an alley where they stored the laundry carts. 

We asked why our room was so different to the website because we thought we must have been given one of their cheaper rooms (you expect some variation, but not this much) and were told the hotel only had two twin rooms, and the one we got happened to be the smaller one they do not photograph. 

We do not like living out of suitcases on holiday, but there was no closet or drawers to unpack into. You got four hangers on the open wall and that was it. The safe was tiny - only big enough for phones or wallets and not a tablet or laptop - and it is located awkwardly on the floor. 

Basically, the place was cramped. We were constantly having to move out of each other’s way and walking over each other. There is not enough room between the bed and desk, or bed and wall, for two people to stand. We would have found the arrangement really unpleasant for more than the two nights we stayed. 

You could also hear the people in the room above because of the very creaky floors. 

That the building is a little old does not really justify these issues. There are plenty of hotels in converted old buildings with good sized, quiet rooms. 

They need to be more upfront about their offering in their advertising and provide clearer pictures of the rooms, not artsy close-ups of the best bits of the best rooms, so you can appreciate what you’re actually going to get. 

We were surprised this property is offered through Mr and Mrs Smith. It is the first negative experience we have had through them.",3,2023,11,19
214,A perfect stay at The Wilder Townhouse,"I stayed at this hotel for only one night (sadly) and it couldn't have been more perfect. All staff were professional but very friendly and welcoming. Set in a quiet leafy upmarket part of Dublin, the hotel is of an extremely high standard with comfortable beds, a wonderful complimentary snack tray, sustainable canned water in the fridge and delightful in-room crockery, to make my room feel home from home!  The hotel has a great contemporary vibe yet cosy and warm at the same time. I particularly enjoyed breakfast with a tempting choice of fresh fruits, compotes, a delicious selection of Irish breads and possibly the best cooked Eggs Benedict I have ever had! Can’t wait to return!",5,2023,11,17
214,We landed on our feet at The Wilder,"A gem of a townhouse, all the comfort and luxury of much more expensive establishments, but the priceless benefit of warm, kind and friendly staff. Feels so homely, we received a wonderful welcome and such careful attention, as we were in Dublin for one of us having eye surgery….. the rooms are well equipped, super comfy beds, lovely generous breakfasts, healthy  lunch and evening sharing platters, with other hearty mains options, all so generous. Cannot recommend highly enough, and we are well travelled!",5,2023,11,16
214,Fabulous ,"Everything was fabulous. Clean room, helpful reception, lovely breakfast, good location.
It is located besides a busy street but you'll be surprised how quiet the room was. Even single detail had been though of.",5,2023,11,13
214,"Charming helpful staff, delicious food and drink, an incredible night’s rest, walking distance to the sights!","From the china teacups in my room for my breakfast coffee, to the soft bed sheets, to the ultra delicious choices for breakfast, to the welcoming gin and tonic, to the charming staff— no wonder I extended my stay for 3 weeks. I always joke with my sons that I want to live in a hotel. Well, this is the hotel.",5,2023,11,10
214,Lovely spot in the heart of Dublin,"A lovely and inviting hotel! The property is whimsical and full of character, and the exceptional staff couldn’t be lovelier or more attentive. We stayed three nights in the Audrey, which had lots of fun touches and was surprisingly spacious. My husband forgot one of his Berluti belts—the staff contacted him right away and shipped it to us so that it beat us home. Go raibh maith agat!",5,2023,11,08
214,"Great location, friendly staff",My friend and I stayed here while visiting Dublin in order to run the Dublin Marathon. It was a beautiful boutique hotel with a wonderful temporary Andy Warhol exhibit there while we were there. The continental breakfast was an affordable addition to the room and worth it. The staff were all helpful and friendly. Our room was on the smaller size but nothing unusual or uncomfortable.,5,2023,11,05
214,When Irish eyes are smiling. ,My wife and I met up with two other couples who live in the states. We’ve been friends for 16 years since first meeting in Alaska. We booked The Wilder and were utterly charmed by every member of staff and also highly impressed with the quality and presentation of the food. Our favourite member of staff was Rachel who treated us all with great affection whilst maintaining an amazing standard of service.,5,2023,10,29
214,Dublin luxury did not disappoint ,"Stayed for 3 nights at The Wilder and echo much of the same feedback others have shared. The hotel is quiet being 5 min from the hustle and bustle of Dublin City Centre. Very walkable to the city and public transportation. The decor and ambience truly have you feeling like luxury. And the staff are extra friendly, from the front desk to the bar staff. An extra shout out to Emel, who despite tending to every guest's needs at the bar and tea room, wore a friendly smile, conversed with me, and made my stay that much more enjoyable. I looked forward to coming downstairs to the bar each night to talk to her.",5,2023,10,23
214,Delighful ,"I just need to gush about the staff, from house keeping to front of desk, they made us feel so welcome with handwritten notes and house made sweets. Plus, the breakfast and light bites would over the top delicious. Five star.",5,2023,10,14
214,Luxury and friendliness in the center of Dublin ,"During our visit in Dublin we stayed in The Wilder Townhouse for three nights and we have had a wonderful experience.

The location is very good, in a quiet part of the city with the busy city and attractions within walking distance. 

The staff is the best ! Super friendly and helpful from the moment you arrive until you are ready to depart. And for this I really mean everyone, staff at the front desk, at breakfast, the bar, the cleaning, everyone. You can pride yourself with these people working for you. 

The hotel is very luxurious, rooms are very good, clean, great bathroom and wonderful housekeeping. 
We had a room on the third floor and that room was very spacious and quiet.

The breakfast served is the best. A very enjoyable continental breakfast and for a couples of euros extra you can order from the breakfast menu which is definitely a must do!

We would most definitely stay there again and highly recommend The Wilder Townhouse to all Dublin visitors.",5,2023,10,14
214,Wonderful Hotel,"I have visited Dublin before and stayed at other hotels, I will now ONLY stay at the Wilder. The hotel is very conveniently located but away from all of the noise of other parts of Dublin. The hotel rooms are more than adequate size and very quaint and comfortable and the breakfast is delicious.  The staff are however what sets this hotel apart.  Every single person we encountered during our stay was incredibly kind and helpful and made us feel at home.  I can’t wait to return to Dublin and stay again at The Wilder ❤️",5,2023,10,13
214,"Welcome, Welcome, Welcome!","Above and beyond the charm of the building and rooms (which is considerable) or the location (peace and quiet, yet easily accessible to the hopping parts of the Dubs), this may be the friendliest place I've ever stayed. Every single employee, without exception, was incredibly nice, pleasant, eager to help, and just downright friendly. In a world of cooler-than-the-rest places to stay, the old-fashioned hospitality was as bracing as a gin and tonic from the bar downstairs. ",5,2023,10,12
214,WONDERFUL STAFF ,"THE SIZE OF THE ROOMS ARE CONSTRAINED BY THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING--SMALL THEY ARE!!

HOWEVER !!--THE STAFF WERE ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL AND UNFAILINGLY HELPFUL.THERE IS A LIMITED MENU BUT THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT AND THE BREAKFASTS STUPENDOUS!

WE WOULD GO AGGAIN!",5,2023,10,11
214,Wonderful boutique hotel in a great location.,"Had a one night stay in The Wilder. To begin with we were upgraded to a suite on checking in, which was a nice gesture. The room was fabulous. Very comfy and homely. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is in an excellent location. Very central yet peaceful location. 5 minute walk to the LUAS (tram) stop.  Small cosy bar. Another nice touch were the complimentary Gin & Tonics. The breakfast was excellent. Great choice and cooked to order. All in all we would heartily recommend staying here if you can.",5,2023,10,03
214,Small gem in Dublin,"This special boutique hotel is where you want to stay in Dublin.  It is walking distance to many things, yet tucked in a quiet neighborhood.  The rooms and common areas are well appointed and the drinks and breakfast are a nice added feature.  The staff is truly the heartbeat of this little hotel.  They are superb at what they do and make you feel like home the minute you arrive.  Oscar at the front desk is the best!!",5,2023,09,27
214,Lovely with a touch of Quirky,We really enjoyed our one night. The free parking was especially useful. They had many high end touches that were appreciated. The only down sides were the size of the room and we couldn't seem to get hot water for the shower. It's possible we didn't want to wait long enough or that it was a high volume time. The staff and breakfast were outstanding. ,4,2023,09,25
214,Wonderful Time All Around!!,"Just can’t say enough about this gem of a hotel! Stayed for 3 nights with 3 friends and we thoroughly enjoyed it all! The staff is second to none. Everyone we met in every capacity is amazing. The details in this delightful hotel are impeccable, from a delicious breakfast to nightly turndown. Beds and linens were comfortable and everything is very clean. And the shower is terrific. Enough rambling…you won’t be disappointed with your stay here!!",5,2023,09,25
214,Lovely quirky hotel with five star touches!,"We had an absolutely lovely stay at The Wilder. A four star hotel with many touches of a five star! Arrival drink in the bar was a great touch and very much appreciated. Rachel who served us breakfast was lovely and Oscar , the duty manager on our departure, professionally and kindly dealt with our feedback. Looking forward to our next stay already!",5,2023,09,24
214,Amazing Staff,"We really enjoyed the hotel, the staff were amazing so friendly, bubbly and helpful! Hotel is really cool and very clean. The breakfast was amazing. We all really enjoyed our stay! Just sorry it was so short! Keep up the good work and I cannot wait to come back again!",5,2023,09,21
214,Another 10/10 stay at my favourite hotel,"This was my fourth visit to the wonderful Wilder and as usual my expectations were far exceeded. This absolutely beautiful hotel feels like a step back in time to Georgian Dublin. The staff CANNOT do enough to help you….the wonderful Rachel even recognised me after 2 years!

The room is beautifully decorated with a lovely turn down service.

Let me describe the breakfast…it is the best I have ever had in any hotel…. I am a fussy and picky eater with ridiculous expectations….again…far exceeded by the Wilder. The most delicious granola and yogurt….beautiful fresh fruit….fresh pastries….it’s so delicious….followed by a wonderful hot food menu…..the service is excellent.

Added to this you are in walking distance to Grafton Street and Stephens Green.

I cannot wait to go back already!",5,2023,09,21
214,Lovely hotel with excellent breakfast,Great hotel. Causal and comfortable with a fantastic breakfast. The staff was very polite. Housekeeping was extremely helpful. Breakfast room servers were great. The climb in and out of the tub/shower combo is not easy and shower is slippery. Anyone with physical challenges should check with the hotel to find an appropriate room. The extra bed provided is really small. I would not recommend it for a child over 10 at most.,5,2023,08,28
214,Winderful place to stay when visiting Dublin!,"This was a step back in time to a beautiful Victorian dwelling. Stunningly decorated and pleasantly located near St. Stephen’s Green and Iveagh Gardens, this boutique hotel is a gem!!  Charmingly situated with a welcoming façade and cheerful patio opening to a very pleasant dining area and bar, the real highlight here is the staff.  You are greeted with a smile and kindness with everyone you encounter.  It seems like they have known us forever and their only concern is the happiness of the guests!  Our room was very comfortable and somehow seemed tied to the past history with adorable china cupboards in the rooms stocked with everything to make our stay pleasant.  Very good nights’ sleep with a beautifully decorated room and bathroom and turn down service at night that made us feel very cozy.  The breakfasts lacked nothing.  Wonderful choices and superior waitstaff, especially Tamara!  A drink at night on the patio was very pleasant and Emil was so attentive to us!  Really had a wonderful time and would highly recommend!!",5,2023,08,27
214,Will return,"Great location, once you park the car (free) you wont need to use it around the city centre.  Overall I liked everything, but found it so quiet that it lacked in atmosphere a little.   My room was for one person and it certainly was that size.  The space around the bed was tight.  The bathroom was split in two (it is an old building renovated after all) with the shower area removed from the rest.  That adds to the quirkiness of the place.  Breakfast was good.  For a slightly different stay from the bland modern predictable hotel I would choose here.",4,2023,08,21
214,5 ⭐️ Location but Room to Improve ,"First the positives. The location is superb for a city break. It’s 10min walk to  Grafton Street, Stephens Green and the rest of the city centre but also only a short walk to the popular south suburb areas like Baggot St and Ballsbridge which are heaving with cafes and restaurants as well as the RDS if you’re attending a music or sporting event. We didn’t need the car all weekend. 
The hotel decor is lovely and it has nice touches such as a complimentary welcome gin and tonic. The free parking, while limited, is also excellent and rare for a city hotel.  And we got to enjoy the garden terrace in the sunshine which is very pleasant. 

Now for the negatives. The rooms are extremely small. We had the popular size and whilst they do tell you the dimensions on the website we still were surprised by them. Unfortunately our particular room was also quite dark and it’s window looked out where the bins are stored and staff smoked. Not ideal. We could also hear every floorboard creak from the room above us. 
The bathroom conversely was very large. Too big really in comparison to the actual room. It’d have made more sense to keep some sq footage back for the sleeping area during construction. But nothing they can do now! But for such a bright large bathroom there was no storage at all. No sink surround even. At least if there was something in there you could free up some counter space in the bedroom. Also the large window was easy to look into from the street so your only option was to fully shut the blackout blind and turn on the lights when showering which is a shame in daylight. A better solution would be to have some type of frosted glass perhaps. And finally the magnifying mirror doesn’t turn towards you so you need to lean sideways over the sink to see yourself clearly in it. A few small adjustments could make this bathroom vastly better. 

Overall we would return for a weekend break and do recommend it (but choose your room carefully). Once you don’t plan on spending a huge amount of time hanging out in the hotel or your room and it’s more of a base for your trip it’s a good option and good value compared to other similar quality hotels in Dublin.

214,Overnighter at the Wilder,"The service, ambience, quality and variety of the breakfast was all excellent. The little extras were all lovely and unexpected e.g. the turndown service at night with suggested reading, chocolates etc. Would return in a heartbeat.",5,2023,08,06
214,Charming stay in Dublin,Charming hotel with lovely staff and delicious breakfast. Location is quiet but central to sights in the city. The bar/lounge is perfect for drinks and snacks. I would recommend to couples and solo travelers.,5,2023,08,06
214,Brilliant typical irish guest house,"Really nice place for a “typically irish” stay ☘️. Nice Gin bar and very good breakfast. Rooms are a bit small, bed is perfect, well equipped bathroom.

214,L,Stunning boutique hotel where old meets new in charming way. We enjoyed staying in their two beautiful suites. Their complimentary gin and tonic was served in very cozy romantic bar. Highly recommending the delicious breakfast served in their beautiful dining room. Thank you Wilder! ❤️🍀,5,2023,07,30
214,We keep going back!,"We enthusiastically and without hesitation recommend the Wilder Townhouse, if you are traveling to Dublin. The rooms are beautiful and lovingly preserve the building’s history. The neighborhood is perfect – quiet but close to so many tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, etc. The Gin and Tea Room is a beautifully decorated and peaceful space and it served the most delicious breakfast we had in all of Ireland. The complimentary gin & tonic that you receive when you check in is a refreshing way to start your stay in Dublin! While the property and food are wonderful, it’s the staff that really make the Wilder incredibly special. We stayed there four different times recently, and each time it felt like we were going home. The front desk staff, food service staff and the housekeeping staff are all kind, fun to connect with, and extremely helpful and competent. They make the Wilder as special as it is!",5,2023,07,29
214,A very special place,"The Wilder just couldn't be any nicer, they have everything right.
All the staff make you feel so special and welcome from the moment you arrive.
The hotel is beautifully designed, every bit of it feels luxurious. 
All the little extras left us feeling totally spoiled. 
Most all though it is the staff that are exceptional. 
Hopefully we will get a chance to visit again.",5,2023,07,25

Rooms are a little small but yet comfortable and clean.",5,2023,07,21
214,"The Wilder is a beautiful property, but it’s their staff that makes the guest experience truly extraordinary.","The Wilder Townhouse was an absolutely wonderful experience for our entire family! The property is a Victorian era building that was beautifully renovated. It’s the perfect balance of old and new, quaint and sophisticated. The breakfast was a highlight of our day with a full menu of delicious entrees as well as continental options. However, it’s the staff that really makes the difference.  The entire team is delightful!  They are the perfect mix of professional and playful. And their level of customer service and personal connection is both thoughtful and intimate providing an unparalleled experience. We had such a wonderful time and would highly recommend The Wilder to our friends and family. Five stars across the board!",5,2023,07,17
214,Perfect spot for a glam city break ,We booked the Wilder for our wedding anniversary. The staff went out of their way to ensure we had an amazing stay. We especially appreciated the complimentary bottle of prosecco on arrival :) For a high end stay in Dublin the Wilder is a refreshing alternative to the traditional Stephen's Green/Merrion Street hotels.,5,2023,07,17
214,Visit to Dublin,"I stayed in the lady Jane Room and it was perfect! It was very lovely, the beds very comfortable, the bathroom was stunning, the staff was very friendly and extremely helpful going above and beyond. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else! ",5,2023,07,17
214,Excellent hotel and above average service from staff!,"Very impressed with this hotel from the moment we were greeted at the front desk.  While the room was smaller than anticipated it was well appointed. 
I particularly want to acknowledge the wonderful service we received from Emel who made the most delicious charcuterie board for us even though it was past serving hours!  It was the perfect end to our day!  She also makes a great Gin and Tonic!
Tanara and Rachel took care of us the next morning at breakfast and made sure we had everything we wanted. The breakfast buffet was beautifully presented and the items on the menu were varied and delicious. 
Would definitely go back to this hotel in his beautiful city. ",5,2023,07,15
214,Gem of a boutique hotel!,"What a gem and a great find in Dublin! Staff are amazing, breakfast is sublime and this boutique hotel is perfectly serviced by the excellent tram service into the city centre (or a 20 minute pleasant walk through St Stephens Green).  We loved the personal touches including the welcome drink and bedtime reading material.  Can't wait to go back!",5,2023,07,12
214,Nice place,"We stayed here for one night in June and it was lovely. Small room, excellent shower. The decor is nice and the staff are friendly. We had a few drinks in the bar which is a very restful space. We didn't eat here as there are other good local restaurants nearby. 
",4,2023,06,29
214,Great Hotel,"The Hotel was situated a few minutes from the main areas of Dublin, with countless restaurants and bars a stones throw away from the hotel.

The free Gin and Tonic on arrival was a very nice way to start a nice weekend in Dublin and the bar was well set out where it was served.

Our room was outstandingly clean and had been brilliantly put together. 

The Staff were friendly and very helpful if required.

Overall cracking place.",5,2023,06,27
214,Wonderful,"Beautiful boutique hotel with super friendly staff, top quality accommodation, food and beverages.

Great breakfast and attention to detail.
Quiet location.",5,2023,06,18
214,A little piece of tranquility in a bustling City,"Had the most amazing stay in this beautiful, boutique hotel, close to all Dublin City has to offer. Our suite was just stunning. The attention to detail is just beautiful in the architectural brilliance of this restored property.  This is coupled with soft furnishings which help transport guests to a place of rest and relaxation and helpful and accommodating staff to whom nothing is too much trouble.  
The breakfast is delightful.  Home sourced ingredients,  served in quintessentially gorgeous surroundings and by lovely staff. 
Best of all....we had a great sleep in very comfy beds and in a very quiet room in an otherwise bustling City, just a shirt walk away. 
We will definitely be back in The Wilder. ",5,2023,06,18
214,Amazing hotel,"Wow! What a lovely hotel. Beautiful decor, extremely clean, friendly staff. 
Stayed here for 2 nights and to exceeded our expectations. The small touches make it stand out. Meringues and fresh strawberries on your room, as well as some complimentary snacks. Turn down service in the evening with chocolates and little books on Ireland for some nighttime reading. Complimentary Gin and Tonic - thoroughly enjoyed these in the outside area of the bar. Extremely friendly bar and restaurant staff. Breakfast was amazing - great continental choice and lovely hot options too. Irish breakfast was amazing! Really enjoyed our stay :)",5,2023,06,16
214,"Fabulous stay, friendly staff and beautiful rooms. Would recommend !","What a wonderful stay. I was in town for work and chose to stay in the wilder - lovely and quite base with a lovely commute / cycle along the canal to the docklands. Camden street is just round the corner and centre of town is not far at all. Staff was super helpful, friendly and personable ties along with a stay in a beautiful boutique hotel, beautiful rooms and the weather for the outdoor courtyard made it all the better my a lovely stay. I recommend the eggs Benedict or the kipper for breakfasts and nightcap on the terrace before bed. I look forward to returning for pleasure (and not work) next time !  ",5,2023,06,16
214,Charming and cozy,"Just on the edge of the city, The Wilder was perfect for us.  On site parking was very helpful.  We arrived very early and they were able to accomodate us right away.  Staff was very friendly.  Loved the charm of this townhouse.  Would definitely stay here again.  Was a great way to start our 2 week adventure in Ireland.  ",5,2023,06,15
214,"Highest recommendation: elegant, quiet, easy walking to most of central Dublin.","Absolutely wonderful hotel.  Charming and gracious from the staff to the rooms. The staff is exemplary- big thank you to manager Oscar and his team - you made our stay wonderful. Also, get the breakfast included-  food is very good and it’s a very good deal.  Will stay here again - tried another similarly rated hotel one night before we left. It suffered by comparison to The Wilder. Highest recommendation.",5,2023,06,13
214,Emel was excellent,"A lovely clean and quiet hotel in Dublin.  We were able to walk to many attractions and desired restaurants.  The staff were friendly and hospitable.

I was especially impressed with the excellent service of Emel at breakfast.  She went above and beyond to take care of us.  Thank you.",5,2023,06,07
214,Luxury and charm well located in Dublin.,"Could not say enough good things about The Wilder. 
Beautiful hotel. Gorgeous and well maintained grounds. 
Incredible staff

We were greeted by Maraya and Clara at the reception every day during our stay. 
Incredibly professional and courteous. They were there and willing to help all my needs and answer all questions. 

The rooms are stunning. Very well appointed. 
Strong showers. Great air conditioning. 
The food is out of this world. Everything was delightful from the check in to checkout. 

Highly recommend this as its walking distance from all Dublin City center but also in a quieter spot in town.",5,2023,06,07
214,Anything but ordinary! ❤️,"Everything about The Wilder is exceptional!  The staff is superb!  Welcoming, engaging and they go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. The decor is somehow both elegant & cozy; just beautiful! The Wilder is  definitely now one of my favorite hotels",5,2023,05,23
214,Gem of a find in Dublin City.,"I recently stayed here and the experience totally exceeded my expectations, to the great welcome from Ciara in Reception to the bar staff and the complimentary Gin and Tonic we received before we headed out..the staff are very friendly and accomodating, the hotel is very tastefully designed and very comfortable, after we returned to the hotel after our night out our bed was turned down with chocolates on the pillows..lovely touch..very quiet hotel..no noise and only a 10 minute walk to St Stephens Green. Lovely outside area to the front to enjoy your drinks..will definitely return.",5,2023,05,15
214,It was okay,"The room was lovely, everything was immaculate. The only thing I would say was a few of the guys at the bar were rude, when asked about bringing a drink up to our room. The shower was absolutely freezing and would not warm up no matter what I tried. And the housekeeper woke us up by pounding on the door at 9:30 even though check out wasn’t until 11. Over all we enjoyed our stay but I do think a few little improvements could be made",3,2023,05,11
214,Beautiful Oasis in the heart of Dublin ,"What a gem of a hotel this is, steeped in beautiful details throughout with attentive, gracious service and unexpected touches. For example, within an hour of arrival, I was surprised with a plate of meringue cookies, this before heading down for my welcome gin + tonic; on another evening, a book of Irish poetry was left for bedtime reading.

Each of the servers at the bar and during breakfast were warm and accommodating, making each guest feel welcome and at home, especially appreciated when traveling solo!

Its location is minutes from the National Concert Hall, Iveagh Park & St Stephen's Green from which all major attractions are easily walk-able. I also loved that it was on a quiet block, far from the madness of the Temple Bar area. 

Yes, the 'shoebox' room is SMALL but it really has everything you could need with lots of luxury details, down to the bathroom tiles & fittings, a Nespresso machine and complimentary treats & mineral water (still & sparkling).

Treat yourself & book this spot while in Dublin!",5,2023,04,30
214,Most amazing small historic hotel,"Esthetically pleasing breakfast with scrumptious dishes.  Bar drinks were amply supplied with alcohol.  Staff, Mazlum and Emel were very proficient.  My favorite was Irish Coffee.  Greeting staff was personable and happy.  In fact all staff was happy!   No attitudes at all.  Very willing to help and make you comfortable.  Windows do open a few inches if needed.  The place was amazing!",5,2023,04,22
214,Nice upscale boutique  alternative to big crowded hotels ,"I had a very nice stay here. My room was quite small - but it should have been no surprise as I opted for the least expensive ""shoe box"" option. Very nicely appointed, high ceilings and comfortable bed. The shower stall was particularly tiny. For one small to average size person it was just fine but if you are sharing a room, I would definitely opt for a larger one. 

Small boutique property in a quiet mini Belgravia type neighborhood. Easy walk to St Stephen's Green and the city centre. Small but attractive/appealing bar and breakfast room - had a good drink and a nice breakfast. 

Everything was clean and well kept - friendly and efficient staff. 

",4,2023,04,19
214,Fantastic boutique  hotel in the centre of Dublin ,Fantastic hotel with very friendly staff and great decor kept very clean and tidy. Quiet area but easy access to the sites and pubs of Dublin. Great breakfast menu with a particular favourite being the full Irish!,5,2023,04,18
214,My likely new regular in Dublin,"My fiancée and I just spent two nights at The Wilder and had a positive experience there. The facility of the hotel is quite lovely and it is situated in a quiet, pretty section of Dublin that is also walking distance to most everything there is to see in the city. 

The staff seemed a bit green as they had little local knowledge to offer beyond preprinted pages that seemed very corporate (eg a restaurant list that seemed to have descriptions written by the restaurants themselves). That said, they were friendly and attentive.

The room was oddly configured but in good order and was comfortable for the two of us. They kindly replenished a courtesy bar each night and the bed provided a good night’s sleep. The lack of a closet or a proper dresser caused us to live out of our suitcases, which limited us some. 

All told, having stayed in several hotels in Dublin before, this is the first I would be inclined to return to.",4,2023,04,17
214,Unfortunately only 1 night,"The hotel itself is beautiful.  The building is a stunning red brick building right in the heart of Dublin.  The outside is only surpassed by the interiors - fun and funky with a surprise around every corner.  
The staff were excellent - everything possible was done to make our stay special. We felt like royalty from the second we arrived.  We didn't eat there, but in the evening we received a gin and tonic on the house as a little thank you for staying.  This is on top of the free coffee, sparkling water and meringues in the room.  The room we stayed in was beautiful - a very large, very comfortable bed, original art works, lovely en suite.
I have stayed in many hundred hotels and this ranks among the most enjoyable stay I have ever had.  Gutted to have only been with them for one night.",5,2023,04,15
214,"The Wilder Townhouse, elegant, accommodating, and quiet","Comfort, matchless hospitality, and the best coffee we had in Europe. All in one package at the understatedly elegant Wilder Townhouse hotel. Just for one salient example, Accommodation Manager Ann went above and beyond to help us out with an extra luggage rack, and with extra blankets on a cold night. It's a bit off the beaten track, but still a lovely and easy walk to st Stephen's Green. And the fringe benefit is quiet serenity. The buildings, common spaces, dining areas and rooms are beautiful.",5,2023,04,12
214,All Around 1st Class Accommodations!,"This staff and property were well above our expectations. We arrived at the property well before check in at 5:30 AM our room was not ready but they provided us with another room to freshen up and relax after our flight. When we returned after some sightseeing our bags were moved to our room. The rooms were well appointed, clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel was perfect we were more in a quiet residential area but very close to all the activities restaurants and sights that Dublin had to offer. The staff were very helpful in providing information and where to go and what to see. Clara booked our train tickets for a day in Galway. She was very pleasant and helpful. The Breakfast was done 1st class the china, presentation and food were better than expected. A word of warning make sure you are very hungry before you order the Full Irish Breakfast it was delicious but very big. I woud have been happy with half the amount. They organized all our Taxis all we had to do was enjoy our stay. They took all the anxiety and stress away. When we checked out it was well before breakfast service began but they had pastry, coffee and fruit waiting for us thanks to Antohin, Jacobs, and Birju. Mazlum was the bartender and he made excellent drinks and provided conversation. Senka, Emel, Rachel and Bianca worked breakfast and were always there with a smile and fantastic service. Anthony, Cian and especially Clara at the front desk were amazing. If I forgot to mention anyone I apologize. I do not know who was responsible for cleaning the rooms but they were exceptional and timely. You will not find a better hotel or friendlier staff than this. Thank you to everyone at the Wilder!

214,Weekend break.,"A very nice and quirky boutique hotel. Just a short 20 minute walk to centre of Dublin.  The only negatives were there was no beans on the cooked breakfast so was very dry  and more butter needed on tables. The rooms are nice and very clean but the coffee machine in the room did not work, so no morning coffee for us unfortunately. ",4,2023,04,02
214,Would return,Overall was pleased with my stay.  Great location and space for some parking.  While bedroom was small it had some features like a fireplace in the bathroom.  Breakfast was nice.  Overall its a very quiet spot so don't expect noise or crowds.  The location allows for that to be accessible nearby.,5,2023,03,31
214,A charming and cozy boutique hotel; exceptional.,"Exceptional staff and beautiful, very cozy accommodations in an upscale part of Dublin. We loved it! Wonderful breakfast in a lovely dining room. We booked it again for a week later. We can't say enough about the gracious, extremely courteous staff. The hotel has so many beautiful touches (and is a short stroll to St Stephen's Green Park).",5,2023,03,29
214,The wilder experience ,"We arrived on March 17th, 2023.  Traveled by taxi to the hotel at 6 am.  The young gentleman Cian greeted us . Welcomed us to the hotel and even though our room was not quite ready brought us out to the dining area for tea and coffee.  He was the first Irish person we met outside of our cab driver.  He was amazingly helpful .  We can not say enough great things about him.  Every great adventure has to have a great start and He was the catalyst for ours.  Thank you so much Cian it's people like  you that make us want to come back",5,2023,03,23
214,Best boutique hotel in Dublin,"I cannot fault this hotel. Charming and beautifully decorated. Fantastic staff, cosy lounge with gin. Breakfast superb. Will definitely be our hotel for whenever we come to Dublin.
Only slight issue is lack of wardrobe space but understand there is a limit one can do in a listed building as beautiful as this.
Thank you to the team for their care",5,2023,03,16
214,Wild about Wilder.,"The Wilder hotel is bliss from a smooth efficient check in to a cosy bar/tearoom that services afternoon delights,cheese boards,toasties etc
Our room the lady Jane was a complete delight,full of querky  touches and spotless to boot. Little things like a tray of goodies and sweets and a poetry book on turndown,what detail,what a strong Housekeeping team.Ann was very helpful during our stay and is looking forward to a busy summer and boy do they deserve  it. Superb location in the city but away from noise etc I cannot recommend  this hotel enough, we will be back as we are wild about the wilder.",5,2023,03,14
214,The wonderful and whimsical charm of the Wilder Townhouse,"Located on a sedate, tree-lined street of Dublin, just a short walk to St. Stephen's Green, a beautiful red-brick facade townhouse, welcomes. Stepping into the intimate and stylish lobby of the Wilder Townhouse, a feeling of peace and serenity prevails. Arriving in the wee hours of the morning, visiting Dublin to celebrate my son's 21st birthday, we were delighted to find our room unoccupied and the front desk kindly allowed us an early check in, where we slept a few hours to regain our wits after our flight from NY.  Another surprise was a complimentary upgrade to a suite, complete with a fire place, gorgeous shampoos, lotions and potions and a plate of fruit and chocolates.  The morning breakfast was perfect with a choice of entrees hot or continental offered. The wait staff too were outstanding and kind. My favorite part of the morning was sipping the robust Americana coffee, and gazing out to the courtyard.  The Wilder was decorated with many unique and whimsical touches, fabulous monkey sculptures and figurines placed strategically about - the china pigs on the mantel of the breakfast room, stole my heart.  The ""Gin and Tea Room"" a small bar offering small bites as well, was an ideal spot before heading out to dinner in Dublin. Guests are offered a complimentary gin and tonic upon check in. The Wilder staff were kind and helpful and one morning not one but three helped determine the best route to the dart station for our memorable trip to Howth for the day (don't miss it!).  Special thanks to the wonderful Mohamed at the front desk, a prized asset to the Wilder. He stood in the rain hailing us a cab on our last morning and answered numerous questions during our stay.. The lovely manager Ann too was a credit and made us feel like family.  It was difficult to leave the Wilder on our last morning but knowing we will return again was for the moment, solace. Though I live with the fear that once the world discovers the Wilder's many charms, I may have difficulty in the future securing a room. Thank you for a magical stay.",5,2023,03,05
214,A Little Gem in the Centre of Dublin,"I was delighted when we first arrived at the hotel. It is very nicely decorated and although the rooms were small they were exactly what we wanted. Pretty, quiet, nicely appointed with a comfortable bed. An added and appriecated touch was the free snacks made locally which I couldn't resist once we got back after a long day of sightseeing. I am vegan and was impressed that I could eat most of the snacks.
The only thing that might have been an issue if I had shared the room with anyone else was that the toilet door opened directly onto the bedroom and if I had needed to use the toilet during the night, the light from the toilet would have woken the other person up, plus the door was not thick enough to stop any sounds from the bathroom into the bedroom. As I did not share my room with anyone it wasn't a problem. 
Also I asked if I could have a firm pillow for the bed, A new pillow did appear that night but it was not much firmer than the ones that were already there. If I had stayed another night I would have asked for them to change it again but luckily I didn't wake up with a bad neck.

We were offered a free G&T after arrival which we chose to take later in the day. Actually I had a cup of tea instead but my friend enjoyed her drink. The restaurant, like the rest of the hotel is a nicely decorated, tranquil space.

The hotel is well located and it didn't take long for us to walk into the city centre. The helpful team at the desk helped to book us into nearby restaurants for supper.

If I visit Dublin again I will defintely go back there. The staff were lovely and the location perfect. I would definetely recommend it.",4,2023,03,02
214,Wonderful experience,Excellent hotel with delightful staff. Well located for central Dublin. Wow what a delicious breakfast all  freshly prepared and beautifully presented by the in house chef. Served by attentive & friendly staff. Outdoor area well kept with attractive seating area and planting scheme. We will definitely be back soon.,5,2023,02,14
214,10/10 - a wonderful hotel,"Great location, great service - the staff team are warm, friendly and professional and the hotel is beautiful. Good value for money and a solid 10/10 for all round experience. Our hotel of preference in Dublin - we'll be back. Thank you.",5,2023,02,13
214,Lovely hotel slightly off the beaten track,"Myself and a friend spent 2 nights here recently. The building is beautiful and the furnishing and colour schemes are lovely. Our rooms on the 2nd floor were slightly oddly shaped - my room 302  - had very little room at the end of the bed but plenty on one side in front of a tall window! A bit strange,  but the bed was large and comfy (firm mattress) and there are nice touches like a free snack selection of Irish produce. The bathroom was compact but beautifully tiled and had a great shower. For 1 person staying alone for 2 nights it was perfect but may have me awkward for 2 people to move around. The breakfast ( included) was excellent. All home made and delicious and generous portions. The staff on reception were polite but did not seem to know much about local restaurants, pubs etc (they gave us a printed list and seemed reluctant to call for us) - i think the management need to train them up in this regard. However, one member of staff stood out for us on our trip - Rachael  - serving at breakfast both mornings - she is a gem. Friendly, warm, efficient - absolutely perfect at her job. Overall i would recommend this hotel for its peaceful location, (15 mins into the very centre) we walked everywhere on foot. Its definitely stylish and the food was excellent.",4,2023,02,12
214,Super find in Georgian Dublin,"Really nice hotel and very friendly staff. Beautiful stay in Dublin, everything close by. Rooms a bit small and on the chilly side of things but spotlessly clean and very good value. A basket of treats was provided which was a surprise . Amazing breakfast and nice bar also onsite",4,2023,01,25
214,"Superb Boutique Property Combining Terrific Service, Location and Value","My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful 5-day stay at The Wilder Townhouse.  It was a memorable stay across the board; made that way by the lovely Lady Jane Suite where we stayed, but even more so by the staff and excellent service they provided.  From the front desk, to bar & breakfast room team, to the cleaning staff, to the General & Accommodations Managers....to a person all were professional, courteous, responsive and simply a great pleasure to engage on a personal level.  The breakfast featured a good variety of options, all of which were fresh and flavorful and always presented nicely.  The premises, inside and out, were always impeccably clean.  The Wilder's location was also perfect: a very pleasant and quiet residential setting, yet only minutes from the sights and sounds of the city proper.  If you're looking for big, loud and glitzy, The Wilder is not for you.  However, if what you want is a more personal, tasteful and truly special boutique hotel stay, then you need look no further than The Wilder!

214,"Outstanding Boutique Hotel for Price, Location, and Service","This hotel truly lives up to all of the nice things that have been said in the five star reviews.  Excellent service.  Excellent location.  Outstanding breakfast.  The free water and snacks in the room was a very welcome and pleasant surprise.  Turn down service at night with chocolates.  .Bar and wait staff treated us like we were royalty when we came back at night after the pubs and wanted an after pub drink and snack.  The rooms and hotel was very clean and tidy.  Price was amazing for all that you get.  This would truly be a five star hotel except for lack of full services and the rooms being just a bit small.  But you pay twice the price at those ""full service"" hotels and they don't even get to know you.  I would highly recommend this hotel for  couples, solo, and business.  Probably not best if you have young children.  But couples on a weekend getaway will fall in love with this place.",5,2022,12,27
214,the perfect boutique hotel,"hands down the best boutique hotel i’ve stated in. very quiet but minutes from downtown dublin. the room was beautiful-every single detail. the bathroom! i need it at home! linens, towels- all so comfortable. LOVED the complimentary breakfast. they do not have room service but did deliver a wide variety of breads/fruits/croissants to my room on my last day there. The townhouse deluxe room was affordable and i didn’t want to leave. wonderful staff- highly recommend The Wilder!",5,2022,12,11
214,Exceptional Hotel!,"We can’t express how great of an experience we had at this hotel! The rooms were very clean and turn down service was able to be accommodated at whatever time. 

My husband and I came for our honeymoon, and jet lag got the best of us. So after breakfast around Dublin, we can back to nap and when we got up to get ready for dinner, while we were gone turn down service was done. 

The hotel also accommodated us with Prosecco on our arrival to celebrate our honeymoon! 

Anne, the manager was incredible! We saw her down at the bar and throughout the hotel talking to guests and being very social. 
All the people in the front desk were very accommodating and we especially loved the bartenders! 

Quite a few nights after dinner, we came back to the hotel bar just to sit, drink and talk to them because they were amazing! 

The only thing we wished is that they offered dinner, rather than small bites at the cafe just because we loved how great the service was around the hotel! 

Not only is the hotel really cute and quaint, but the staff made our honeymoon that much more enjoyable! 

Can’t wait to go back soon! We would 10000% stay at The Wilder again!",5,2022,12,02

214,Birthday celebration,"We stayed in The Wilder recently for a birthday celebration and I would highly highly recommend it! The location is perfect for exploring the city however the hotel is a quiet oasis from busier parts of town. The room was beautiful, really stylish décor throughout the property and I had the best nights sleep I've had in a while. I cant thank the staff enough for their hospitality, they really went above and beyond to make our birthday celebration special. We will certainly be back on our next trip to Dublin, and don't skip breakfast, it was fantastic!!",5,2022,11,24
214,Beautiful Hotel and excellent staff made for a great stay !,"This was our first time visiting both Dublin and Ireland. 

We had chosen 'The Wilder Townhouse' purely going by the internet. 
Overall it was a really lovely and beautiful Hotel throughout. It's perfectly located for a nice stroll really to anywhere you want to go -  follow the Canal towards Ranelagh, Camden Street way or even a 5 / 10 minute walk into the City Centre around near Trinity College / Temple Bar etc. 

We didn't have a car in Dublin so we found the location to be perfect. 

The staff were all terrific and accomodating throughout our entire stay. We had two seperate rooms situated next to each other. Both were very well appointed, quiet, comfortable and the night service team would always leave nice chocolates if we were out and they came past for the turn-down service. Fridge was re-stock daily with either still or sparkling water which is complimentary also. 

The complimentary Gin & Tonic upon checking in in their adjacent bar area is really nice. The staff in this area on some occasions double-up for the breakfast crew also which is in the same area each morning. A plentiful amount of food on offer for Breakfast also both in the main area at your own leisure or to order from the menu provided. 

The only part we found, it did rain on three of days during our stay and we didn't have umbrellas provided in the room to use. Only on one of the mornings was there one available upon the area where you walk in to the Hotel so i'm not sure if people take them when available and hold onto them for their stay? ( Not sure how it works ). No issue at all as we managed in the end and the staff were apologetic when we asked which wasn't their fault at all. It is what it is :) 

Aside from that though, a beautiful Hotel, perfetly located, excellent staff throughout along with drinks and breakfast / food offerings and a really great stay.",5,2022,11,20
214,Stay at the Wilder,"Great location, newly renovated. Beautiful interiors, simple but not austere. Staff very kind and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. Comfortable beds, nice linens. Rooms are a bit small, so spend a little more for a little more space.  Would stay again and get a larger room!",5,2022,11,18
214,Amazing stay can’t wait to return!,"I’m just back from a stay at the Wilder Townhouse, and it thoroughly exceeded my expectations! Checkin was quick and the lady who checked me in was brilliant.

We had a pint in the bar which was lovely, and the bar staff were great. 

The room itself was gorgeous and we loved the little snacks that were left in the room. 

I can’t wait to return already!",5,2022,11,14
214,Beautiful Hotel,"Our stay in the Wilder exceeded our expectations. The decor is exceptional and our room was finished to the highest standard in keeping with the architecture of the building. We didn't eat in the restaurant but had a few drinks in the bar which was very relaxing and the service was excellent. The complimentary gin and tonic was a nice touch. Breakfast was excellent. 
Sarah was particularly helpful regarding our enquiries about the bedside lighting and colours.",5,2022,11,10
214,Fell Short of Expectations,"Felt slightly misled by the website.  Expected the rooms to be quite small therefore, booked a Delux room for the 'space to spare' but was disappointed at the size of even this room. Lack of hanging space and NO draw space.  Had to live out of the suitcase. Luckily we had winter clothes so nothing got creased - would be differnt in the summer though. The so called king sized double bed was two single mattresses pushed together with no topper!
Very nice bathroom but not user friendly as a block of offices along with a building site could look straight through the large window so had to keep the blinds down, thereby losing all natural daylight.  
Tried to get a sandwich on arrival but were told the hotel did not serve sandwiches?  Again, contrary to the information on the website.
Positives though include Anna who looked after us superbly in the very comfortable bar/lounge.  Breakfast was excellent (both food & staff).  Very good location.",3,2022,11,05
214,Excellent service in beautiful ambiance,"We spend 2 nights in the wilder and loved our time there! The hotel is beautiful, very well decorated- stylish yet homely (I especially loved the restaurant). 
Service was great, Sarah helped us out with all our questions/request and went out of her way to make us comfortable .
 Rachel and Cherise were very friendly and service oriented as well. 
Hope to be back soon! ",5,2022,10,27
214,Poor customer service. Does not care  about its repeated custom.,"Really really poor customer service.
General manager on the front desk was particularly unhelpful.
So disappointed in my treatment.
Could never recommend this hotel as beautiful it is due to the staff and it’s very unaccommodating policies…",1,2022,10,24
214,"Great location, wonderful atmosphere","We spent two nights at the Wilder Townhouse & couldn't have asked for a better stay. Staff on reception were very helpful & friendly. They provided us with adapters, booked taxis for us & answered all our many questions. 
Breakfast was delicious, with both buffet & á la carte options available. I recommend the gorgeous Irish brown bread! 
Location is very central & we walked everywhere, unless it was raining! 
Very pleased with our stay & will recommend to friends. 
",5,2022,10,24
214,Excellent !,"1st stay but coming back! Niche boutique hotel, great location, our bedroom a little tight, bed comfortable, good bathroom. Breakfast amazing ! Front of house manager Laura Ward very welcoming and helpful.",5,2022,10,22
214,Fantastic Stay . Would highly recommend ,We had a wonderful time at the wilder townhouse. Our room was beautiful with really quirky interior. The wilder is in a great location and we were able to walk everywhere during our stay . The staff were friendly and professional.  They created a lovely atmosphere in a fab setting. I would highly recommend and will definitely be back .,5,2022,10,22
214,A hidden gem in Dublin,"Very nice hotel located in Dublin city centre. Room was very tastefully decorated and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was amazing - simply the best breakfast that I have had in an Irish hotel. The customer service from check-in to check-out was informal, friendly and of the highest standard. ",5,2022,10,22
214,Nice place to stay!,"The WilderTownhouse was a nice place to stay!  It was just outside of downtown Dublin, which made for a nice, quiet stay.  We lucked out and the weather was great so the 10 minute walk into town was very pleasant. 

The room we had was good,  old style charm, bed was comfortable, not a lot of room to hang clothes, the bathroom was tiny and there was no hairdryer but overall it was clean and a nice room to come back to at the end of the day.

We found that the best part of this hotel was the lovely staff that worked in their beautiful tea room, where we had a nice breakfast every morning and the bar staff was great as well,  the welcome gin & tonic was delicious!",4,2022,10,18
214,Classy and convenient,"Beautifully appointed boutique hotel in a central and quiet location - brought my ear plugs with me but didn’t need them! Short walk to Grafton street shops and restaurants through St Stephen’s Green. 

Great breakfast options and generous portions to set you up for the day. Full à la carte menu of hot dishes to choose from as well as a continental breakfast buffet including some lovely Irish cheeses.

Special thanks to Sarah the GM and to Rachel and Cherise for making us feel so welcome and well looked after during our stay! Look forward to returning on future visits to Dublin!",5,2022,10,18
214,A very disappointing experience.,"Having read similar reviews here, I see I am not alone at the receiving end of extremely unprofessional customer service by The Wilder Hotel. 
With just over two weeks to go to check in for a very special occasion, I received an abrupt email to say my accommodation had been cancelled by the property. No reason provided, except when reached by phone, the Hotel blamed Booking.com. Quick phonecalls to Booking.com revealed it was in fact the fault of the Hotel who had overbooked. Not that the Hotel assumed responsibility. 

My reservation had been made, and confirmed, in May of this year, almost 6 months prior to a very inconsiderate, abrupt and without justifiable reason, cancellation. 
Surely within a 5 month time frame the management could have given me ample of time to try find alternative accommodation in a busy city and on a busy weekend. One of us knew they had overbooked and it certainly wasn't me! 

While it seems a lot of people have gotten to enjoy this lovely hotel, others, like me, were literally left high and dry.  It really shows a lack of integrity to carelessly and randomly inconvenience people who have put their faith in what they thought was a reputable and trustworthy hotel. 

To other customers, perhaps have a plan B in place when contemplating a reservation with The Wilder. There is absolutely no customer service satisfaction when at the hands of a hotel who does not care enough to give a truthful explanation for letting guests down! 

If only I had read the reviews here first!",1,2022,10,15
214,Solid place if you plan to walk around,The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The bar and food staff are extremely nice. There isn’t really much food options after breakfast however. The rooms are clean and the Wi-Fi is solid. Tv is a bit lame and the location is about a 10-15 minute walk to the better areas of town. However I will say the area is quiet and nice. Over all a solid stay,4,2022,10,15
214,Very enjoyable and relaxing stay at The Wilder Townhouse,"The Wilder Townhouse was very relaxing and enjoying experience for myself and my mum for our birthday treat. The room was very comfortable and we had everything we needed. The staff were exceptional, very attentive and friendly. Always a warm welcome! And with a complementary gin on arrival! Breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of pastries, fruit, hot food and again the service was on point with a friendly face. Would definitely return to the hotel on our next trip to Dublin! ",5,2022,10,13
214,They cancelled my booking,"The team at Wilder Townhouse cancelled my room 6 days before I was due to arrive in Dublin due to an overbooking situation without further explanation.
Extremely disappointed with this service as I was looking forward to staying and visiting Dublin for the first time.",1,2022,10,10
214,LOVELY PLACE TO STAY,We loved staying at the Wilder Townhouse. The rooms are small but very comfortable and the breakfast is worth it!! It's on a quiet street with some parking available. I can't say enough about the staff at the front desk and in the bar/breakfast area....very helpful and accommodating.,5,2022,10,09
214,Gorgeous Stay,"We stayed at the Wilder Townhouses for 2 nights and were delighted by the service, the team, and the “Drinking Room”.  Everything was top notch:  the G&T, the beds, shower and toiletries.  All truly top notch.",5,2022,10,05
214,One of the best small hotel experiences ever!,"Wow - an exceptional boutique hotel!!

The personal interactions with staff was great - from pre-arrival, to check-in, breakfast and bar.

The hotel is an older building that was remodeled and beautifully appointed. Perfect location for us - quiet neighborhood, within a short walking distance from downtown.
Due to my wife's health situation, we had a few special requests, and the staff went above and beyond to help us. Never made us feel like we were bothering them, and always showed a genuine desire to help.

I really enjoyed the breakfast/bar area and the outdoor patio (table with umbrellas), where I could sit and quietly get some work done, while sipping on a pint (or two) of Guinness. And the breakfasts were excellent!

When we return to Dublin in future, we will most certainly again stay at The Wilder.",5,2022,10,04
214,Room review,OMG when they say a small room!!?! They mean a really tiny room! Yikes where do you put your luggage ?! Staff is very nice for so 5 stars for them but value for the money-not so much. Nice place but so tiny for a room,2,2022,09,27
214,Vacation/Holiday,The Wilder townhouse in Dublin island is a beautiful place to stay. It is in a nice quiet neighborhood but still close to all sites to see in Dublin. All staff are welcoming and lovely people.  I highly recommend including the breakfast with your stay. You will not be disappointed it is delicious! Julie&Frank,5,2022,09,27
214,Nice but small,"The staff was the best part of this place.  The room was just too small.  We booked a popular double which is one size under the suite size so not the smallest. There were a couple of hangers but the rack was so close to the wall you couldn't really hang anything on...it was more like to display one or two pieces of clothing and then nowhere else, not even a luggage rack.  Well a drawer that held the hair dryer. But not a shelf, nothing.  So we had to stumble around our suitcase and backpacks.  So yeah if an overnight trip you are fine but we stayed three and it just didn't work.  And then the bathroom was cool but a lot of wasted space...with a tiny shower.   Yeah it's a walk in but one of those corner ones so you barely move.  

I was going to also have some things laundered while we were here but the prices were more than when we were in London so we ended up at a launderette down the street.

We did eat breakfast but it's confusing...you get this like tower of stuff after you been going to a small little buffet table with the same types of food.  We wanted to end our nights at the bar but it's small and closes way too early.  I think 10pm. 

And I personally did not think it was as great for walking as other area's would have been.  

The staff was perfectly nice but just not worth it.",3,2022,09,26
214,A true gem in Dublin,"Nestled in a quiet residential neighborhood within a short walk to St Stephens Green and the city center, this hotel is an absolute gem.  Beautifully appointed, and incredibly comfortable.  The rooms are lovely, but compact.  The breakfast room, and gin bar were a hit, and the outside patio made for a lovely place to enjoy an afternoon Gin & Tonic after a day spent in the city.  Special shoutout to the staff, who were all lovely and incredibly accommodating.  Special thanks to Laura, Cherise, and Anna at the front desk who were an absolute joy to deal with, and always welcomed us with a smile.  I wish I took closer note of the names of the entire staff at breakfast, and at the bar as they were equally as lovely.  Can't wait for a return to this lovely little find.",5,2022,09,23
214,An amazing anniversary trip,I don’t write reviews very often but the experience at The Wilder was so amazing I felt it only right to share. My wife and I stayed here for six nights for our 10 year wedding anniversary. The staff at the Wilder made this the best trip we have ever taken. They made us feel like family from the moment we entered and went above and beyond the entire time we were there. I can’t recommend the Wilder enough. It is the only hotel I will stay in when I am back in Dublin.,5,2022,09,22
214,Joan marion,"Fantastic boutique hotel!
Wonderful quiet location! Walkable to sites & Grafton Street shopping! 
Beautiful artistic decor!
Exceptional service! Beyond expectations! 
Breakfast and dining room delightful 💕 
I would definitely stay again",5,2022,09,20
214,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I stayed at the Wilder from September 16-18th. 

The decor is stunning. 

The complimemtary breakfast were absolutely stunning and had so many choices.

The location was great. 

The complimentary cocktail (gin and tonique) was smooth, pretty. Other drinks were reasonably priced.

I am bothering to write this review, however, because of the unreal customer service I received from absolutely everyone there. They went above and beyond in every interaction I, my husband, my parents, and my sister had with them. 

I 110 percent recommend staying there. If I ever come back to Dublin I will be booking at the Wilder!",5,2022,09,20
214,Loved the attention to detail!,"Such a wonderful hotel! If you are into interior design, art, attention to detail, relaxed atmosphere, wonderful staff and service, then look no further. A rare find - book it NOW. I travel a lot and all over and I am so happy to have found this gem. I did not want to leave! Highly recommended.",5,2022,09,12
214,A hidden gem - absolutely amazing!,"Where to begin? This hotel has it all. A perfect location on a quiet residential road, yet very  close to the city centre. The Wilder is a beautiful period house, completely renovated with such an eye for style and attention to detail. The atmosphere is absolutely stunning! Rooms are immaculate and you are spoilt for choice with a cosy and wellassorted bar, a lovely tearoom and a wonderful patio.
Upon arrival you are treated to a complimentary G&T, a perfect way to wind down. At dusk the candles are lit - also on the patio. So lovely. Blankets are discreetly provided, so you are comfortable sitting outside a bit longer.
And - the breakfast! The very best I have ever had…an abundance of everything you could imagine, all fresh and delicately served.
All in all, the staff at The Wilder have created something very special here. It is so apparent that the guests’ experience is what matters to them. 
I have stayed in Dublin almost every year for decades now in many different places - But this one has now captured my heart!
I will be back…",5,2022,09,12
214,loved this charming hotel,hotel is in a great location. its in a quiet area but still walkable to a great many attractions.  best part of hotel is amazing staff.  Erin in particular was so lovely and helpful.  Everyone made us feel so welcome.  Can't say enough good things about this wonderful hotel.,5,2022,09,10
214,A stylish and chic hotel break,"Really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful hotel. Staff were all super friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

The breakfast was really tasty as well and lots of choice between cooked and continental style.

Will definitely come back soon!",5,2022,08,30
214,Charming and quiet retreat,"This is one of my favorite hotels ever. I prefer to stay just outside of the hustle and bustle when I travel, and this beautifully design boutique hotel is perfectly located. 

Just a 10 minute walk to grafton street through St. Stephens Green park, which is beautiful and rich and history. It’s part residential, part business so there are taxis available if you need, but walking is safe and lovely. Walk 10 mins in the other direction and along the canal and you’ll hit Baggot St. which has tons of restaurant and bar options. Cute places along the way as well! 

The room itself is average for local standards, but may be small in comparison to the norm. I was incredibly comfortable and had more than enough room. I appreciated the charming aesthetic that makes the rooms and hotel feel rich in history, while staying modern and fresh. Everything felt very cozy and well designed. 

The bar and restaurant being available was really a lifesaver for me. My stay here came after two weeks of travel and I was tired, so having the luxury of a beautiful and delicious restaurant downstairs was something I was very grateful for. One night while I was working I forgot to eat dinner and the manager was able to provide a snack I requested, and brought it to my room at no charge!! The bar made one of the best gin and tonics I’ve ever had. 

Really looking forward to returning anytime I’m in Dublin!",5,2022,08,29
214,Really impressive staff,"Our second stay at the Wilder. A perfect location for access to the south centre city. Staff were really excellent - welcoming, responsive, friendly and genuine. A special thanks to Rachel - who we remembered from last year - and who looked after us with great friendliness, attention to detail and true professionalism. 
Our room was great, but would have been a bit on the 'compact' side for a longer stay.",4,2022,08,29
214,A very enjoyable stay,"Spent two nights in the Wilder and was blown away by the hospitality we received.Laura,front of house manager was exceptional and I was suprised to hear that she had only recently taken up her position -a true professional.
Josh in the bar was another ray of sunshine as were the ladies serving breakfast.Breakfast itself was outstanding,one of the best I’ve ever experienced.All the extra touches were really appreciated and the decor was very tasteful.Great location ,tucked away from the hustle and bustle but still so central. I am really looking forward to a return visit.",5,2022,08,23
214,Absolutely Perfect!,"The Wilder has spoiled us!
This hotel is new and a great deal of care obviously went into the design. The room was very comfortable, with loads of electrical outlets, good lighting, 2 chairs, efficient bathroom (with good counter space despite a small size), and stupendously wonderful breakfasts. The staff is all very helpful, professional, and very friendly. It was hard to leave!",5,2022,08,22
214,Simply Sophisticated,"I loved the location, our bedrooms and the breakfast. This hotel has such a charm and warmth that’s needed in travels. Both sophisticated and fun!after being in the south of Ireland all week. Staying here I could walk to St.Stephens park and other shopping neighborhoods. The staff was helpful and friendly. I hope to return again.",5,2022,08,22
214,"Excellent location, beautifully decorated hotel with wonderful staff!","My daughter and I spent five nights at the Wilder on our visit to Dublin.  It was even better than I had expected!  You can't beat the location - on a quiet, residential street, but just a few blocks from St. Stephen's Green and also quite close to a LUAS (tramway) stop.  We felt very safe walking back in the evening and were able to find restaurants within easy walking distance.  The decor is both soothing and very charming - it was a big reason why I chose the hotel. I really enjoyed all the artwork and the general style of the hotel (sophisticated, modern, elegant, and  a lot of character).   We had a ""Townhouse suite"" which was amply large and comfortable.  Additionally, it had windows on three sides and lovely views (we were on the third floor).  The staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful (particularly in teaching us how to get around Dublin, using the LUAS or calling taxis through the ""FreeNow"" App).  The breakfast was lovely as well.  If we return to Dublin, we will definitely choose the Wilder again!!",5,2022,08,20
214,Fabulous,"A truly lovely hotel.
I recently enjoyed a four night stay at this gorgeous hidden gem. My room was comfortable, and spotless, with a beautiful very modern bathroom. The breakfast was both beautifully presented, and delicious, and the patio is the perfect spot to enjoy a nice refreshment.
The location is perfect for anyone wanting to see all the central sights.
The Wilder’s greatest asset though, is the staff. Every single person I came into contact with greeted me cheerfully, and did everything that they possibly could to make sure I enjoyed my stay. They were a great team of people! Five stars all round.
I absolutely highly recommend.",5,2022,08,19
214,Phenomenal hotel stay!,"This was our first stay on our trip around Ireland, and we couldn't have been happier with The Wilder! Within walking distance to so many things, we appreciated how easy it was to get around. It was also located in a very quiet neighborhood of Dublin which we enjoyed as well. The hotel itself is beautifully updated and very clean. We loved our room, very cozy clean and comfortable. The breakfasts were AMAZING every morning with the continental offerings, plus a tea tray PLUS a hot plate, and all of the food was delicious. However, I would have to say what really made our stay at The Wilder so wonderful was the staff. The front desk staff, the wait staff at breakfast, and the bar staff were all so great, so friendly, and provided the best customer service I've ever experienced at a hotel. They made you feel so comfortable that you felt like you were right at home! A MUST stay for anyone looking for lodging in Dublin!!",5,2022,08,18
214,Refined with a central location,"The Wilder exceeded my expectations. The location is perfect for getting to lots of tourist attractions and it’s nestled in a quiet little area so returning to the room is a peaceful experience. The staff was helpful and efficient, particularly Erin at reception. 
My reservation included daily breakfast which was a great start to the day. 
I had a room on the third floor, tucked in a corner and it was very quiet and well-appointed. 
I would definitely recommend The Wilder and would absolutely stay there on a return trip.",5,2022,08,17
214,Dublin Get Away,"The Wilder was perfect location for a Dublin experience. The accommodations were great and the staff was incredible. the staff was willing do whatever was necessary to make our stay perfect. Finally the breakfast is fantastic, may be the best i have ever had in the UK",5,2022,08,16
214,Quite location in walking distance to city center,"The hotel must have been fully renovated recently with lists of good taste and nice designs. The location is good as it‘s in walking distance to the city center, yet not too noisy and busy. Unfortunately the service is lacking in many aspects. The staff was very friendly but appeared to be not very experienced. The bar staff, a young lady,  didn’t know the kind of beers that were served, let alone the selection of gins that came as a complimentary welcome drink. Every drink that was being served had to be signed on a bill immediately instead of checking the bill of known hotel guest at the end of the evening. We got offered complimentary pastries (croissants and pain au chocolate) which seemed to have been left from breakfast of the previous day and were totally un-eatable as the butter got runny. When wanting to check out in the evening due to a very early departure the next morning, the staff said that this wouldn’t be possible without a managerial approval which wasn’t possible in the evening. At the checkout in the morning, the staff a the reception wasn’t able to print out for my review the final bill before paying it with the credit card I had deposited prior. Only after insisting that I wanted to see and check what I was paying, the staff produced a copy of the bill. So all in all, good location and nice hotel as no g as you are not depending on good customer service. There is certainly room to improve for the management of the hotel, which then could really become a good recommendation.",3,2022,08,16
214,Disappointed...,"Nice hotel, but I had booked a ""Deluxe King Room"" and was disappointed to see that the ""King Bed"" was actually two small mattresses pushed together (with the uncomfortable middle area between the two mattresses). I was expecting the room to be ""European size"" (ie. small) but was disappointed to see that there was no closet or drawers of any kind whatsoever, forcing us to live out of our suitcases on the floor. The bed and lack of space made this a two or three star experience at best and not the advertised 4-stars. There are better rooms to be found at a better price in better locations in Dublin.",3,2022,08,14
214,"Excellent stay, will definitely return!","I stayed at the Wilder Townhouse a few weeks ago on business for one night with a colleague, and we had one room each. We were both really impressed by every aspect of the Wilder. We were fortunately able to check in early due to room availability, and the rooms were both decorated, maintained and cleaned to a fantastic standard. The facilities were excellent, with great breakfast in the morning, and the bar was great! We both fell in love with the outdoor seating area.

The team at the Wilder were absolutely fantastic. We were checked in and assisted throughout our stay by Erin, who went above and beyond to make our experience there wonderful.

After my stay there, there was a delay with the hold on my card being lifted, however this was no fault of the Wilder, and both Erin and Laura were extremely pleasant, helpful and professional when I phoned up regarding this - when I was admittedly a little grumpy due to having a bad day.

I would give the Wilder my highest recommendation, and hope to stay there again very soon!",5,2022,08,06
214,Quaint getaway,"Sarah and her staff made our trip A1 and beyond pleasant.  We felt like we were at home amongst friends.  Couldn't have asked for a better stay!!!  Off the beaten path, clean, quiet and quaint.  Highly recommend~",5,2022,08,04
214,Wonderful experience in every way,"Beautiful accommodations with first class service.  From the moment we checked in to our complimentary upgraded suite until we sadly left, our every whim was catered to.  We started with a welcome drink in the bar and finished with a sumptuous breakfast.  The servers were attentive at the bar and breakfast.  The suite was lavishly appointed with luxury linens and towels.  The Butler’s chocolates were a nice touch as well as the cups and saucers for the in room tea and coffee.",5,2022,08,03
214,Nice Oasis in Dublin,"We booked this hotel when we saw it listed on the Small Luxury Hotels list.  We intentionally booked a suite as we were going to be staying for a week and would need a little space to spread out (it was the first stop of a 5 week trip through Ireland).   The Townhouse Suite was lovely, with nice space and a big bathroom (we had a first-floor room off the lobby, do not remember the room number).  It looked like the picture on the website.   The bed was big and comfortable, the bed linens and bath towels were very nice.   Our room was near a busy street, but the sound did not come into the room.  We would have liked to sleep with a window open but there were no screens on them and if open we did hear the traffic.   While the room was spacious it was missing a couple of things, first, some sort of dresser or shelving for our clothing and the hanging area for clothes was small.  We ended up living out of our suitcases during our stay.   Maybe the hotel is targeting shorter stays?  Second, there was no floor lamp in the living area so if we wanted to sit there in the evenings the only lighting option was the overhead light.   
The front desk staff and the staff in the restaurant/bar area were very friendly and helpful (except for one front desk clerk who was not helpful when we asked for guidance on avoiding traffic issues due to a pride parade).    The housecleaning staff was inconsistent, the room was always clean, but sometimes they left washcloths, sometimes they didn't, sometimes they left a new bar of soap (they always took the used one), and sometimes they didn't.   
As mentioned by others the breakfasts were wonderful and a big star of the show at the hotel.   We also had a meal in the evening and liked it a lot.  
The location of the hotel was great for us.  It's just outside the main tourist area, but just a short walk got you to most of the key sites.   We enjoyed the walks and were lucky the weather made walking everywhere possible.   And it was really nice to come back to the quiet and relaxing atmosphere of the hotel - an Oasis in a city.  
We enjoyed our stay, but we've stayed at a few other Small Luxury Hotels and Wilder Townhouse did not provide as ""luxurious"" of an experience as we expected or as we've had at the others in this group of hotels.",4,2022,08,01
214,Stylish but not luxury,"As a hotel that is part of the Small Luxury Hotels of the Worlkd brand, we expected more.  This is a stylish hotel, very clean with a young enthusiastic but not necessrily knowledgeable staff.   The rooms are really, really small.  We made the mistake of booking this hotel for an entire week in Dublin and regretted it.  Neither the popular room we originally booked and stayed in for 4 nights, nor the deluxe room we eventually were ablte to move to, had a dresser!  Living out of suitcases for a week was not what we expected from a 4 star hotel.  The popular room lacked bathrobes, although the deluxe room had them.   The showers were excellent, with lots of hot water and nice, fluffy thirsty towels, in pleasant, clean bathrooms .But not having an exhaust fan in the bathroom of a hotel knocks it out of the ""luxury"" category for me, for sure.   That said, the breakfast that was included is well worth the money - hands down the best breakfast we had our entire stay in Ireland.  Very nice little bar.  Luas stop (tram) a short 5 minutes by the canal - very convenient if where you are going is by the Luas.  Quiet, Regency-lined residential location.  If I were looking for a quiet, stylish and comfortable place to stay in Dubklin for a night or week-end, this might suit.  But not really set up for longer stays.",4,2022,07,31
214,"Charm, comfort and convenience","From beginning to end our experience was fantastic.  Reception was helpful and so very welcoming.  Even before we arrived the Wilder extended their hospitality with a list of nearby restaurants and an off to make reservations.  We did dine at Suesey Street, a short walk away and had a delicious meal.  Back to the Wilder, we loved the little bar where we were treated to a gina and tonic, compliments of the house.  Our room was just lovely with a comfortable king bed.  The room was well appointed and all of the modern conveniences.  It felt like we were staying in someone's posh guest room.  Included, too, the next day was a brilliant breakfast in their lovely dining room.  We were able to walk to our sightseeing attractions easily and yet have the quiet of a neighborhood.  The only down side of our stay was that it wasn't long enough!!",5,2022,07,29
214,A night away that made our special occasion,"Having recently got engaged, we decided to treat ourselves to a stay in town on the day we picked up my engagement ring. A treat it was! This hotel was a delightful discovery in an area of Dublin I thought I knew so well. I'd describe it as 'Quirky' but that would perhaps do a disservice to the carefully considered details all throughout our stay. The personalised note in our room, the welcome drink in the bar, the fantastic coffee table books on window sills and tables throughout the property. I haven't had a bath in years but the inclusion of bath salts among the toiletries in our room, tempted me to indulge! 

Breakfast was fantastic. It was a terrific selection of fresh food, as well as hot food. I've missed breakfast buffets post Covid but this felt like a glorious return. A touch that we really enjoyed was the stand that arrived at our table, like afternoon tea...but for breakfast! This is something I'd never seen before and really enjoyed. 

Our evening in the Wilder was a really special stay. It allowed us to 'play tourist' for the night in our home city; town looks different when you're not rushing for the bus, Luas or taxi. From the decor to the service to the extra touches, The Wilder is a beautiful hotel that pays attention to details.",5,2022,07,26
214,Lovely time,Staff was excellent. The breakfast was amazing. Definitely would stay there again! Perfectly located and easy walk to many attractions. The rooms were nicely remodeled and property was beautiful. 10 minute walk to good pubs.,5,2022,07,23
214,bijou!,"only stayed for one night and was glad I was on my own. To say the room was small would be an understatement. The bathroom equally so. Working was difficult as the ""desk"" was only as deep as my laptop, and no chair just a stool
Also some road noise, even with secondary glazing
Breakfast was a saving grace. All fresh with plenty of choice. Service was exceptional",4,2022,07,22
214,Exceptional hotel,"We stayed at the Wilder Townhouse in May for 3 nights and were very impressed with the Wilder. The Wilder was one of 8 hotels we stayed in during a European trip and it stood out as the best hotel during our trip, beating big 5-star brands by far. Location-wise, the hotel was within a short walk to Grafton street and the shopping area. The rooms were spotless and were meticulously cleaned in the morning, with a nice refresh in the afternoon. Everyone we interacted with at the hotel was very helpful and knowledgeable, going above and beyond their duties. The staff from the restaurant were very professional and courteous. Their breakfast was superior by far, which included fresh fruits, freshly baked pastries and other goodies.
I highly recommend The Wilder and will stay there on my next trip in Dublin.",5,2022,07,20
214,Everything Perfect ,"We stayed for one night and every detail was perfect from check in to check out. The staff were all so nice and took time to help and chat, they were never in a rush but did everything professionally also. We had a welcome drink in the bar and retired to our room which was compact but beautifully decorated. Great shower was a good start to the day and then on a fantastic breakfast. Honestly miles above any other breakfast we have had in any hotel in the last few years and again the service was brilliant. There was also free parking outside for about 10 cars and overall the building, the grounds, the public areas, furniture and artwork together make it all feel special. I won't stay anywhere else in Dublin from now on!",5,2022,07,20
214,An oasis of calm in the city centre !,"* Do not make the mistake of assuming this hotel is not central because it very much is *  This was a fantastic city centre experience.  

St. Stephens Green, the National Concert Hall, the Eye & Ear Hospital and a cluster of professional service and global firms are literally right around the corner. More, aside from the usual ongoing city centre building projects, the area is located in a calm, quiet area nestled between the cluttered St. Stephens Green and Grand Canal traffic clusters. The entrance and reception areas are stunning with no detail spared. The artwork in the reception is great and colour schemes throughout the hotel are contemporary but very much in keeping with the old townhouse vibe. 

The feeling of early evening tranquillity and good company at the reception and at the beautiful residents-only hotel bar (thank you Laura!) is very real which is a rare commodity in an age where many hotels are run by VC/PE funds that lack the attention to hospitality detail that the owners of the Wilder have clearly cultivated. 
The room, whilst not especially big exceeded all my expectations for a business traveller. Overseas visitors to Ireland and the UK tend to be unaware of development rules for old, listed buildings like the Wilder meaning rooms are configured to what the urban planners will allow. However, the Wilder has ensured every detail of comfort is met (high quality pillows and bed linen, excellent shower quality and a smartly 'ergonomic' set up when you need to login to the PC and work. I managed to get parking out front for my stay. Whilst I know parking is ‘first come’ for all guests, the location is so central that you should consider leaving the car at home if you can. 

While I did not have breakfast every light snack and coffee at the bar and the complimentary house G&T were top notch. 

I will absolutely be back to the Wilder!

Bryan C",5,2022,07,14
214,Ideal location for exploring Dublin City,"We had a lovely night in the Wilder. Greeted with a Gin and Tonic on arrival is the best way to begin your stay and John at the front desk couldn't have been nicer. The interiors are as nice as the building itself and the bar area is ideal for grabbing a drink before headng out into the city. The breakfast was one of the highlights, it has everything you could want and Rachel really looked after us well. It's the perfect spot to stay on the doorstep of some of Dublin's best attractions.",5,2022,07,05
214,No parking available,This is a nice hotel BUT the cars in the small lot never moved and we had to drag our bags from the street across gravel. Also we had to drive around for awhile to park and then restart the meter on the street again in the morning. No fun when on vacation.,3,2022,07,04
214,"Perfect, cute and everything I wanted","I booked a small double room and absolutely loved my stay, everyone I encountered in the hotel was kind and helpful. The room was beautifully decorated and the rain shower was the best.

It's in a great location to wander through St. Stephen's Green and beyond.

Breakfast was wonderful as well! I look forward to another stay on my next trip.",5,2022,07,02
214,Perfect,"We took two rooms here and couldn’t have been happier. Small doubles. Yes they are small but with lots of lovely art and comfort and perfectly fine. It’s friendly, beautiful, the location is great. Breakfast was superb. I think one of the best in a hotel I’ve experienced in a long time. The Gin and tonics were very nice too (in the evening)! A gorgeous hotel.",5,2022,07,01
214,Beautiful hotel and friendly staff,"We stayed for two nights on a weekend and loved it. The red brick property, the interior, comfy beds, the staff, the breakfast, and the location. All great. Without fault, this is the ideal place for a weekend getaway.",5,2022,06,28
214,The Wilder Townhouse recharge,"Wilder Townhouse experience in a Deluxe Room was a  fabulous 3 days after the 11 day full on Wild Atlantic Way tour starting in Belfast

The Reception Team were excellent and more concierge recommending restaurants booking tours etc...top!!

Breakfast is a great start to the day.....

We walked from Wilder into the hotspots but frankly get a taxi

BOOK UP everything in advance in terms of trips or restaurants as Dublin gets busy...

Thoroughly recommend!",5,2022,06,21
214,A wonderful hotel,My wife and I stayed at The Wilder for our wedding and it was amazing. The building is beautiful and the room in particular was wonderfully decorated. The breakfast is the best I've had in a hotel. We had a fantastic stay.,5,2022,06,15
214,Excellent boutique hotel,"We stayed two night recently. So pleased with the hotel, the staff, the location, food, in fact everything.
We took a suite and found it very spacious and well appointed. 
I would absolutely recommend this hotel to you.",5,2022,06,14
214,Lovely boutique hotel,"A short walk from anywhere you’d want to be in Dublin, The Wilder Hotel is perfect!
It’s cozy but modern, with great artwork around the common spaces.  Breakfast is excellent, staff is excellent, and the room was very comfortable.  The only downside was a lack of a closet - but things were very manageable with the hanging rack provided.  Highly recommend The Wilder!",5,2022,06,13
214,Gorgeous But …,"This is a VERY nice place. Extremely well appointed and decorated. Very trendy and quite unique. BUT be warned! These rooms are, as beautiful as they are, VERY VERY tiny and the bed, as comfy as it was, is NOT a king bed in any size or form or per “Ireland standards”. It’s a double bed and the room description borderlines false advertising in our opinion. The bar and restaurant is very nice and very “on trend” with a free gin and tonic on arrival. Breakfast was also very nice and really well presented. All in all, a very nice, trendy place but just be prepared for tiny rooms and a small bed (and only 2 hooks on the wall to hang stuff so probably not suited for more than a 2 night stay).  Having said that, and now knowing what to expect, I would probably stay at this hotel again when visiting Dublin.",4,2022,06,13
214,Last minute cancellation by hotel,"We were due to stay here for two nights on the 23rd of May. It was an anniversary present to my wife which I booked in Dec 2021. The day before we were due to fly I received an email informing me that there was an issue with their booking system on the day that I booked and that they could not accommodate us. I can understand a system issue but they had 5 months to inform me. Plus a courtesy phone call would not have gone amiss rather than a cowardly email. Luckily we were able to book a room in a hotel of our choosing and it did not impact out break too much. If their customer service is this poor before we arrived, I am glad we didn’t stay there.",1,2022,06,08
214,Fantastic boutique hotel on the edge of Dublin's center with amazing breakfast service,"The Wilder Townhouse was an amazing location to start our time in Dublin; it's on the edge of Dublin's center which means its in a quieter neighborhood, close to some great restaurants, and still less than a 5 minute walk to St. Stephens Green and less than 15 minutes from the Temple Bar area. This made it perfect for peaceful nights rest after a day exploring downtown. The breakfast each morning was the best of any we had on our stay in Ireland, and while they don't offer dinner service, the cocktails (including a complimentary G&T) after you get back from exploring were great.",5,2022,06,04
214,Equisite : My home away from home.,"Please forgive me as I forgot to write this review. This is my home away from home. The room is not big but the welcome is and the team and the ambiance are just perfect. Tucked away on quiet historic Adelaide rd; minutes walk from St. Stephen Green, my BFFs house, Grafton street, and simply perfect for coffee with dear friends.",5,2022,06,02
214,Top Reasons To Stay At The Wilder Townhouse,"1. It's a small boutique hotel with an intimate ambiance.
2. It's tastefully and beautifully decorated.
3. Friendly and very helpful staff.
4. It's impeccably clean.
5. Comfortable beds.
6. Modern bathroom.
7. Bright, pleasant breakfast room.
8. Wide array of delicious offerings on the breakfast buffet.
9, Tasty, quality hot breakfast items.
10. Its quiet location is convenient for visiting Grafton Street, St. Stephens Green, the National Art Gallery, Trinity Library and the Book of Kells, and the National Art Gallery.",5,2022,05,30
214,Excellent boutique hotel in Dublin,"Only stayed one night but was very impressed. All the staff were very friendly. The room and bathroom very very nice. Excellent breakfast. It’s ideally situated to be off the track and in a quiet road, but very close walk to the canal or Harcourt LUAS stop.",5,2022,05,27
214,Boutique Hotel at its Finest!,"Three night stay at the end of our Ireland trip. Staying in the city centre can sometimes had a non stop hectic feel but the location of The Wilder really elevates this tucked away just off Adelaide Rd. The hotel in general is immaculately presented both inside and out.  

We arrived rather late into Dublin without thinking of booking a restaurant so massive thank you to Ida (not certain of spelling) and Thomas for managing to get us a reservation at The Little Kitchen which was fantastic. 

Our room was beautifully presented with the most amazing shower. 

Breakfast each morning was faultless except for our mistake of ordering overnight oats which assumed would be cold however it was on the hot menu and was definitely hot, lovely lady offered to change instantly but declined as couldn't waste food like that for our mistake. Eggs Royal 10/10 and great buffet offering. 

Two things we wished were better - 

Cocktails on our final night before we headed out for dinner were dreadful. In preparation and presentation. The piece of fruit to garnish the Negroni looked like it had been chewed by a dog and the drink itself was cloudy? Whiskey sour was left standing so long whilst Negroni was being prepared it was like water with a horrible disintegrated foam on top. Really didn't taste great. Offer to remake them was kindly declined as we were at that stage running late.
Finally as we were leaving before breakfast service the next morning a take away offering was suggested which turned out to be just a coffee, no problem with that. However, a simple American was so bitter it was undrinkable. 

Would definitely stay again.",5,2022,05,25
214,Absolutely Wonderful,What a beautiful stay we had here. The staff were brilliant. So helpful and friendly. It was a beautiful building and lots of lovely Irish Gin’s at the bar downstairs. Highly recommended. We would stay again for sure.,5,2022,05,24
214,"Location, breakfast all in an amazing space!","Check in was a little clunky, but they were nice and maybe were being trained etc. Free GnT at the bar was a nice touch thou, and our room was upgraded as my parents needed a accessible room and they put us side by side which was preferred.
We stayed in the Lady Jane suite which was outstanding, room was spectacular, shower was worth the stay alone, a waterfall of warm water! High ceilings and white ware was unreal quality. 
Breakfast and the service was amazing, our server was a real treat and was really attentive to my older parents. 
The location is unreal and you’re central to everything, worth splashing out, only downside is 5 star prices and no pool or sauna etc.",5,2022,05,22
214,Good quality boutique,"Very good boutique hotel about 15 minutes' walk from the city centre. Everything in the room - size, offerings, bathroom etc - were excellent apart from the view of multiple dustbins and laundry bins - so request a room that faces on to the road. The staff (albeit very young) were good and  keen to help.",4,2022,04,22
214,A luxurious and memorable stay!,"My partner and I stayed at the Wilder back in February for a couple of days while planning our wedding and very quickly knew from the standard of service, stunning decor and attention to detail that it was the right place for us to return to for the week of our wedding in April!

As the staff became aware of our upcoming nuptials we were upgraded to a suite and nothing was too much trouble - ensuring packages delivered for the wedding were already waiting for us in our room as well as a thoughtful note welcoming us back to the hotel and wishing us well along with pastries. 

Our second stay far exceeded our first and we cannot speak highly enough of the  friendly and helpful staff, divine breakfasts and unpretentious vibe of this little boutique hotel.",5,2022,04,20
214,Wonderful stay at a truly unique property!,"I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Wilder and I was very impressed with several aspects of the property. 

Truly unique decor in rooms and common areas, luxury tolietries, good quality towels and bedsheet, relaxed atmosphere, lovely bar, free parking on site, set on a quiet, leafy street walking distance from all main Dublin sights and seversal restaurants and bars. 
Breakfast cooked to order, plentiful portions, and great quality food. 
Bar food was also very nice. 

Just a little bit more attention to dust in the room and a better air-con system would take this hotel to even better ratings in my opinion. 

Would definitely return!",5,2022,04,19
214,"Beautiful room, good location, poor food, friendly service but not yet 4/5 star","We stayed for one night and loved the decor and location. Room was on ground floor and a good size for a central city center hotel (they do have a range of sizes!). Wardrobe is a few hooks on a wall, fine for us, but if you are making a stay of more than a couple of days you may need more space. Young and friendly staff but learning their trade....not yet at level where they know answers to basic things or what great service looks like. Real let down was the food. Served the worst breakfast I have ever had....inedible, grayish bacon, hard black pudding, greasy  egg and old mushroom. Asst Manager apologised and said it was unusual. I pointed out the fruit on the buffet....bananas with skins splitting open. The apology felt like words without understanding. Not a high attention to detail or food hygiene was my impression. I had just spent a week though in a truly excellent hotel in Co.Kerry so perhaps the juxtaposition was even more noticeable! We ordered the charcuterie board the night before in the bar, staff didn't know what the cheeses were. So nice team but if they invest in some training and standards, as well as great decor, they could take it to another level.",3,2022,04,18
214,The Wilder is an absolute gem!,"What a beautiful, quiet, and convenient property The Wilder was. Everyone was friendly, the decor is top notch, the whole place is very quiet and relaxing. I love the area of town it was in, very convenient to walk to the busy areas for shopping and dining but certainly enjoyed the quietness around this place. The breakfast is divine and there is an adorable tuxedo cat that comes by and you can watch them play from the windows or if you are sitting outside. They provided lovely toiletries from a well known brand called Replica and that was a nice touch. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and the temperature was easy to set.",5,2022,04,14
214,Stunning boutique hotel,I stayed at the Wilder for 3 nights for a family wedding. The staff were very friendly and professional. Great breakfast cooked to order. The hotel was spotless and the decor was amazing. Great location in the city. I would highly recommend The Wilder for a city break or a family/friends get together.,5,2022,04,13
214,A class apart,"Understated. Unpretentious. Completely at ease with who and what it is. The Wilder trumps the two five star hotels I stayed in over the previous nine months in Dublin: not because it’s grander (although it is elegant) not because it’s more lavish (although it is exquisitely designed) but because the whole experience, from check in to breakfast, to the complimentary g&t, to any and all interactions with the staff leave you feeling completely at home and utterly relaxed. The location is superb-close enough to the action but at a sufficient distance from the centre to have a quiet night’s sleep. The rooms are a little on the smaller side but the space is cleverly used and the bathrooms are fantastic. A real gem.",5,2022,04,07
214,Lovely boutique hotel,We stayed at the Wilder for one night and was very impressed with how beautiful this little townhouse was. The decor and interior design was stunning and really made you feel like you were staying somewhere other than Dublin. The breakfast was one of the best I've had as it was an a la carte menu with lots to offer! Shower was amazing with fab toiletries on offer! Staff were very friendly and accommodating too. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay a little outside the hustle & bustle of Dublin city centre!,5,2022,04,05
214,Fantastic gem,"We stayed for two nights at wilder and this plastering is something very special. The staff were very friendly and professional, the breakfast was the best I’ve ever had. 
The building is fantastic and the design and decor are perfectly balanced between old and new. 
The showers are excellent with superb pressure. We stayed in a small double which is more than enough for a couple. We had some 20 Rooms between us and not one person had any negative comments. I would highly recommend The Wilder",5,2022,04,02
214,Can’t wait to return to the Wilder,"One of the best hotel stays I’ve had. The hotel and restaurant were beautifully decorated and the staff were wonderfully attentive. Little touches make all the difference here and I’d recommend it for any personal or business travel. Highlights were G&T on arrival, breakfast (beautiful selection and table service menu) and excellent customer service from all staff.",5,2022,03,29
214,Great Vibes,"I stayed here for 2 nights over St Patrick's Day. It is located a little south of Temple Bar and St. Stephen's Green but easily within a 15min walk, which turned out to be great because it is really quiet at night. It is also very easily accessible from Dublin Airport via public transit. 

The room was clean and spacious with amazing amenities and a great bathroom - c'mon we all know how important that is when travelling. There were no dead spots with the WiFi anywhere in the property. 

The staff were absolutely a delight to talk to and hang out with. They really made the place shine. It made the experience so much more personal and intimate. It really made us feel like we were hanging out with friends. The bar and cafe set up in the on-site restaurant was really on-point. The baristas and bartender on duty clearly knew what they were doing! It is also the small things that stand out, like sending us an email letting us know when our room was ready, and giving out masks, sanitizing wipes, and hand sanitizer by the door. 

Massive shout-out to Cian, Rocio, Becca, and everyone else at the front desk and the restaurant for making our stay so so amazing. We will be back!",5,2022,03,25
214,Night away in the city,I loved this hotel from the minute we arrived. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The decor is amazing and the bar is lovely for a few relaxing drinks. We will definitely stay again and would recommend it to anyone. It is in walking distance to Stephen’s Green so it’s very handy.,5,2022,02,05
214,Fantasticstay in the heart of Dublin,"Stayed with my partner in January for a weekend and we had a fantastic stay.
The place and staff is so alive and full of amazing vibes that was contagious. 
The rooms are beautiful and cosy, we stayed in the suite and must say I could easily compare it with a 5-start hotel. 
The staff at the bar and breakfast area were simply high level and made us feel very welcomed and looked after. Big shout to John and Rachel for how they looked after us.
It is a place that I would recommend for any occasion really and it was an experience I will always remember.",5,2022,02,04
214,Highly recommended,"I stayed here at the end of last year while taking care of business in Dublin. I was very impressed with the location, the facilities and the care and attention to detail given by the staff. It is clear they have a passion for the premises they run and the service they deliver. I intend to return again when next in the city. Also, the breakfast was a highlight!",5,2022,01,16
214,Amazing stay,Absolutely beautiful hotel in the heart of Dublin. Fantastic food and fantastic service. Staff exceptionally attentive at all times. Would fully recommend this venue. Looking forward to returning again soon.,5,2022,01,12
214,What a brilliant stay,"Thank you so much to the whole team for a great weekend break. The staff are so helpful creating an oasis of calm in the city center. The room was superb, very spacious and modern. The food was divine and very reasonably priced. 

The staff went above and beyond throughout our trip to ensure we had an excellent stay. We will definitely be back... looking forward to our next weekend break!!",5,2022,01,06
214,A top notch boutique hotel,"We spent 3 nights here in November.  The hotel was beautiful and well located in a quieter part of Dublin but still just a short walk away from the centre.  Service was excellent, the staff were consistently friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was absolutely amazing with a la carte options on top of a huge tray of scones, cakes and other treats.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a little luxury.",5,2022,01,02
214,Location good rest for us not so great,"Reviews are. Always each individual experience and own prefer 

Location good 
Room looks nice 
Bathrooms was very nice 
Bed personally opinion not comfortable to hard 

Constant banging noise outside our window all night
 Dirty ceiling cover in bathroom 
Bathtub looks great is very big but not comfortable to get in and out if you have any walking or knee issues the top of it is very thin so nothing to hold onto 

Customer service 
Was told Night Shift could check us out , or otherwise I would have paid the night before. Well Night Shift crew tell me he is only there to clean up, no clue in how to charge a different credit card.so it turned out I had to send emails from the airport to pay with the correct card later on 

 I also had called to reserve a parking spot on site so that walking would  not be a issue that disappeared but the assist mgr did give us a free dinner and paid for street parking  to tell us how sorry he was.

Would we return honestly no",1,2021,12,31
214,Lovely place just off the beaten path,"I stayed for three nights ending a solo trip to Ireland. It is a lovely establishment and in a safe and pleasant neighborhood (important for a single woman). You can walk pretty much anywhere (e.g., St. Patrick’s is only about a 20-22 minute walk.) The staff attended to all my needs and made good restaurant recommendations within a 5-10 minute walk. The breakfast was also amazing. Would definitely stay there again. (It also has an outdoor sitting area that I bet is lovely in the warmer months.)",5,2021,12,11
214,Excellent from the moment we stepped through the door,"We were three sisters staying for one night, room each, we were greeted by the lovely Rosilex upon arrival, she was efficient, friendly and arranged a lunch for us in the dining area. This was a very enjoyable refreshment before we headed off on our shopping expedition.  Our individual rooms were perfect, the mini bar was not atrociously over priced, room was spotless, great nights sleep.  We enjoyed a complimentary gin cocktail before heading out for dinner.  Breakfast the following morning had an exceptional choice, we were served again by Rosilex and we also met John who was chatty and friendly.  
I couldnt recommend the Wilder more, I am looking forward to a return visit in 2022",5,2021,12,11
214,Great find in a lovely location.,"We stayed here last weekend and had a great time. Lovely location and hotel but the best part is the staff, every member of staff are so helpful and friendly and make your stay special. Breakfast is very good with a great selection and cooked to perfection. We will definitely return on our next city stayover.  Parking is limited but there is parking available outside. Well done to you all.",5,2021,11,22
214,"Simply perfect - a glorious boutique hotel, a short walk from city centre.",Absolutely adored this hotel.  Total perfection and attention to detail.   Wonderful service.  Gorgeous food.   Excellent gin.   Thé breakfast was the best I’ve ever had.  Rachel who served us deserves a special mention for her welcome.  We shall definitely return.,5,2021,11,01
214,Best hotel in Dublin,"This is one of the best hotels we’ve stayed all over the world. Very attentive staff, nothing is too much of a trouble. The hotel decor is amazing, the room is of a good size and the bed is really comfortable. Breakfast choices are great. We even received a welcoming complimentary drink. We will definitely stay here again if we come to Dublin in the future.",5,2021,10,31
214,Couldn't fault it,"A really stylish hotel. Staff were so friendly. Service was v quick. Room beautiful with a very spacious bathroom and big tub!
Breakfast was delicious. They serve you an afternoon tea style selection of goodies, I have to say although it was lovely, it is rather unnecessary as there is a very good selection of pastries, Yoghurts, fruits etc at the buffet table. The three tiered selection takes up a lot of space on the small tables. Hit breakfast was scrumptious. 
We were offered a welcome drink at the bar, a fabulous G&T. I had an espresso Martini, also delicious.
Location is fantastic, very close to Stephens green and the national concert hall.
Really lovely experience. Many thanks to all the staff for being so attentive.",5,2021,10,27
214,Beautiful boutique hotel,"What a gem! Beautiful find in a great location. Lovely boutique hotel decor. Very similiar vibe to The Montenotte Hotel in Cork. Makes perfect sense now after discovering they're sister hotels. Definitely worth trying the Montenotte gin, it's really good! The mix of old and new throughout the hotel is done really well. We generally opt for a lie in instead of getting up for breakfast but gutted to have missed it after seeing pictures of the breakfast spread. Will have to try it in the next visit. Staff are lovely and friendly.",5,2021,10,25
214,A hidden Gem in the city,"Anything but ordinary was inscribed on the room key holder….. and that it is.
From the beautiful reception area to bar/restaurant rooms etc everything was exceptional.
We stayed in a small room which was perfect for us. Looking forward however to return with my husband and stay in a suite for a truly luxurious experience. 
The complimentary arrival drink is a lovely little touch served with some olives or almonds to nibble on.
All the little extras are what makes this hotel so unique.
I’ve stayed in lots of 5 star hotels around the world and this is up there with the best.
The breakfast was lovely. Cooked fresh to order which is rare in hotels anymore.
The fresh orange juice was Devine as was the continental selection taken to your table on a stand with plenty of selection.
The staff are very experienced and polite.
A special mention to Josh whom was so attentive to us.
The decor throughout is fab and quirky yet in keeping with this beautiful old building which is steeped in history.
The luas stop was a few minutes walk at the top of the road and we enjoyed a spot of shopping on grafton street.
We left feeling fully refreshed and only wish we could have stayed longer.
Can not wait to return and this hotel will definitely be a must every time we need to stay in the city",5,2021,10,24
214,Lovely hotel with some small rooms,"This is a small hotel that used to be townhome. I believe there are over 40 rooms total.  Be sure to check the square footage of your room. Some rooms are so small they should be closets!  Bathroom was lovely but again small. It is located in a peaceful area of Dublin, slightly off the beaten path which can be refreshing after the Temple Bar area.  There is a nice walking path that runs along a canal.  There were not a lot of restaurants open or even around the hotel so it’s a good thing that the food there was excellent. There is a small parking area at the hotel. However, the staff was absolutely first rate and couldn’t have been more helpful or accommodating. I feel our room was very small and was overpriced, hence the 4 star review and not 5 star, but all-in-all it was a lovely hotel for a couple of nights. We stayed the end of August.",4,2021,10,03
214,Stunning!,"What a fabulous hotel! Quirky, modern, beautifully furnished and decorated, spotlessly clean.  Just a few minutes walk to St Stephen's Green and Grafton St so a great location for exploring Dublin on foot.  Staff are all really helpful, especially Rachel who looked after my wife for gluten free breakfasts and she was spoiled for choice. 
 We stayed in room 201 which was a Townhouse Deluxe Double, imaginatively decorated with lots of space and a really powerful rain shower in the bathroom.
We will definately be back especially for the complimentary G&T's!",5,2021,10,03
214,Fantastic boutique hotel,"This was the nicest and best hotel of the four on our Ireland trip. Beautiful building, private parking, beautifully decorated rooms, very friendly staff that goes the extra mile. Fresh, very extensive and delicious breakfast made to order and served at your table. Tasty and affordable G&Ts. We did not understand the word 'complementary', thought that a G&T was offered as a welcome drink, but had to pay it at the checkout (our mistake). If we come back to Dublin we will definitely stay here again. Within walking distance of all sights and yet quietly located.",5,2021,09,30
214,Small but perfect rooms and the best hotel brekkie in Dublin,"We stayed one night, arriving in the afternoon were able to sit outside on the small patio area and have drinks and snacks. 
Our room was described as small, which it was, but perfectly formed, spotlessly clean, very stylish. There are no wardrobes, just a coffee station and tiny fridge but perfect for one or even two nights. Plenty of electrical sockets conveniently placed. For longer stays I'd book a larger room. Bed was extremely comfortable, room was air conditioned. Great nights sleep.
The breakfast was exceptional. We'd booked for 10:30 and they rang us at 10:15 to say the dining room was a little busy, could we hold off for a ten minutes. Then they rang back to say they were ready for us. That was really thoughtful, rather than have us hanging around we were able to take our time and not clutter up the lobby.
The breakfast itself consists of the usual continental stuff then the usual cooked options but we were encouraged to mix and match, one of us had pancakes, bacon, sausages, nothing was a problem. Fresh OJ and great cappuccino. 
The continental items came on a tea stand which is a really practical and fun idea. 
The staff throughout our short stay were perfect and nothing could have been improved on. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2021,09,26
214,Beautiful property ,Where to start about this place? It is absolutely stunning! The staff are so friendly and warming. The rooms are each so different and stunning very beautiful. The breakfast was absolutely stunning and presented so well. I cant say enough about how amazing our stay was here! It is a must see!,5,2021,09,26
214,A wonderful hotel,"We had a fabulous visit  the staff couldn’t be nicer  our room was very comfortable, clean and spacious 
We were taken care of so well   Can’t wait to go back
This is a first class hotel right in the middle of dublin",5,2021,09,26
214,Amazing Stay - incredible staff …,From start to finish the staff at the Wilder created a great experience for us. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfasts are superb and rooms are quiet and well appointed. Ideal location.  Close to the efficient Luas Tram line. We will definitely be back and highly recommend it.,5,2021,09,19
214,Loved this place -Top notch!,"We have stayed here on 3 seperate occasions recently and each time we have  loved it. The service is incredibly warm, friendly and acommodating from the moment you enter. The place itself looks fantastic inside and out and is pristine too. Rooms are really cosy and well desinged with very confortable beds. 
The breakfast was a nice surprise also with an afternoon tea style selection of cakes accompanying the other food we ordered. We had some drinks in the bar on each occasion and again the staff were extremely nice and happy to look after us. 
The location of the townhouse is really good for exploring the city centre with just a quick walk from the bars and restaurants back to this quiet, almost surburbian feeling street just by the canal. 
I would highly recommend The Wilder to natives and visitors from abroad alike, a lovely experience.",5,2021,09,16
214,Amazing Stay - 5 Star Service,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights on our staycation in Dublin City this summer. The staff were excellent, very old school 5 star treatment - even down to a phone call to the room as soon as we settled in to make sure everything was to our liking. The building itself has been beautifully restored and really feels like you're staying in lap of luxury. Just around the corner from Camden St, there is no shortage of great restaurants and bars to choose from - one of our faves being Hang Dai. 

Couldn't recommend this place enough, great value, great service, great location and super comfortable bed. (So comfortable in fact when I found out who made their pillows, I bought one online for myself the next day.) 

A little gem in the heart of the city.",5,2021,09,15
214,Lovely Place - Awful Service,"The place is lovely albeit the rooms are very small.  The staff are extremely friendly but the service is amongst the worst I’ve ever experienced.  More than an hour wait for breakfast on both mornings, over half an hour to bring drinks despite the small bar being empty.  It’s a real shame as this place has potential but it’s impossible to recommend given the extremely poor level of service…",3,2021,09,10
214,Service excellence epitomised,"Mum and I decided to visit the Wilder Townhouse for her 70th birthday. I told the hotel in advance so they could add a couple of little touches to make her feel special. They delivered a wow service experience. Somebody who made it very special for her was Numan, the duty manager. Despite the masks, you can feel the warmth of Numan’s smile. He strives to deliver the best possible experience to all the guests and expresses a lovely sense of gratitude when complimented. I definitely recommend the Wilder.",5,2021,08,30
214,Overnight Stay - A True Treat!,"Upon arrival at The Wilder Townhouse the realisation swiftly dawns that this will be a hotel experience to remember.

Located in the heart of Dublin's city centre, this Victorian listed building, complete with decorative red brick facade, is visually stunning.

A mere 10 minute walk from St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street, the hotel boasts all the welcoming attributes which are certain to prove immensely popular with guests as the summer season continues and autumn soon arrives.

We were warmly greeted by general manager, Barry Francis, and while we waited to check into our room, we enjoyed the ambiance of the outdoor terrace as we were served complimentary refreshments.

Our room, a townhouse de luxe double, was smart and chic in its presentation - a touch of modern with a nod to its Victorian fabric.  Complete with nespresso coffee machine and well stocked fridge, the room was abundant in its comfort, the rainforest shower affording a revitalising start to the day.

The Gin and Tea Rooms, atmospheric in its dimmed light setting, affords guests the opportunity to choose from a selection of light bites during the day and a vast array of drinks from its extensive menu.  

Quirky and unique decor abounds within the hotel's interior, the Garden Room being the hub for breakfast - and what a selection on offer for your first meal of the day.

Served in afternoon tea style, home baked breads, scones, muffins and pastries, are exquisitely presented. 

Laden with freshness and taste, the early morning delicacies are complemented by cafetiere presented coffee, prior to the arrival of our hot plates. Porridge complete, with raisins, honey and almond milk is both nutritious and flavoursome, while the choice of smashed avocado and poached eggs is a personal favourite of my guest who notes the plate's presentation as she savours each dining moment.

As we dine, the surrounding feel is one of utter relaxation - with the Garden Room conservatory doors open, you hear the birds chime - bliss!  Earthy green tones dominate the furnishings and we are at one with nature - a wholly positive feeling not often replicated in city centre hotels.

Our hosts during an all too brief stay are courteous and provide the ultimate in guest service - all requests are duly received and compliments must go to Barry Francis for the manner in which staff working at The Wilder interact positively with staying guests.

While holidays are proving popular outside of Dublin this summer season, the capital city has much to offer - before school returns make it your business to visit the sights on offer and choose to stay in The Wilder Townhouse - sheer elegance, sheer serenity, sheer bliss - you will not regret your choice.",5,2021,08,20
214,Fantastic staff and a beautiful stay,"Myself and my boyfirend had a fantastic stay. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the staff looked after us wonderfully, particulary Numan! The hotel is beautiful, tidy and stylish and the breakfast was exceptional. We can't wait to return!",5,2021,08,17
214,Perfect City Break,"We're just back from a 2 night stay. Rooms were beautiful and stylish, and it's a great central location to explore Dublin. Wonderful staff, who couldn't do enough to help. Breakfasts were a self indulgent highlight. Shout out to the bar staff for an amazing Negroni. Highly recommended, and we will definitely be back.",5,2021,08,17
214,A fabulous three night stay!,"We had an amazing three night stay at this fantastic hotel. Situated on a quiet street, although in walking distance to the sights of Dublin, it is the perfect place to stay in Dublin.
The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. The decor is modern & stylish, the rooms beautifully appointed with power showers & comfortable beds. The breakfasts are varied, of the highest quality & delicious.
I can recommend this place to anybody wanting a classy hotel in Dublin. Can’t wait to return.",5,2021,08,15
214,A Hidden Gem in Dublin City,"Classy and understated.   A beautiful building, tastefully decorated and a delightful place to stay.
Super friendly and professional staff, yummy light bites and a breakfast that can only be described as perfection.    Well located less than 10 minutes walk from SSG.     A place to return to.",5,2021,08,05
214,Stunning Property!,"I can't write highly enough about this stunning property.  On arrival I had a warm welcome, check-in was easy. and I was settled into the property.  The staff can't do enough for you, the service was exceptional and friendly.  The rooms are beautifully decorated, as is the hotel itself.  Sitting outside on the terrace in this quiet location is simply stunning and yet within walking distance to the city centre.  The Wilder Townhouse employees are all amazing and look after their guests extremely well.  I wish I could list all their names as they all deserve a mention.  Thank you Rachel for attended to my breakfast requests and being so cheery in a morning.  I loved this property so much it makes me want to return for another stay.  Thank you to all at the The Wilder Townhouse...simply stunning!",5,2021,07,31
214,A real little escape!,"This hotel is an absolute gem, in the outskirts of Dublin city centre so away from noise and crowds but right beside the public transit connections. The ambiance is really relaxing and quirky, we loved all the decor! It would be easy to imagine this is a little hotel in the countryside with all the access to the fun of the city.

Enjoyed two really lovely nights here and have to say the staff made every possible effort to make us feel comfortable and despite being quite nervous about Covid protocol, everyone was taking care to keep guests at comfortable distance, cleaning tables and serving breakfast in a delightfully different way to keep things safe. These guys have it nailed and I would be delighted if we get the chance to return for a break in the near future. 

Oh and, if someone recommends Harry's latest cocktail creation to you, you need to try it!",5,2021,07,30
214,Magical Place,"My daughter and I stayed three nights and did not want to leave. This hotel is an absolutely fantastic establishment.  Beautiful interiors, great patio, and a warm and caring staff that is happy to help with any request.  Highly recommended.",5,2021,07,25
214,My new favourite.,"A lesson learned here to not always go for the big hotels. This place is an absolute gem. Spotlessly clean, incredible decor, superb service from the moment we arrived. Lovely little touches and attention to detail. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to the Lady Jane suite which was the nicest room I have ever stayed in. Bed so comfortable, air con in room, bath divine and fantastic shower. Breakfast was delicious but also served so well within covid regulations. Staff also so careful in this regard. Lovely also to learn about the hotels history from Barry upon checking in. Would love to know more about the women who came through here. I imagine it was some place. It has been restored to an amazing standard. Staff friendly and had lots of time for you to answer Qs chat etc. Felt like we mattered as guests and not just another number.
Well done to all who work here.",5,2021,07,24
214,An absolute must stay!,"I have never written a review for any hotel before, but I feel I must on this occasion.

In my many years of staying in various hotels in Ireland, UK, Europe and beyond, this 2 night stay was by far the best, most pleasant stay I've ever had and that includes any of the 5 star, big chain hotels. (Westbury, Four Seasons etc)

The hotel itself is beautifully finished in a modern, tasteful manner and has a very relaxed, but professional atmosphere. We were made feel very welcome by all from arrival to check out.

Most noticeable of all was the staff and their friendliness and attention to the customer by all of them. Most especially I have to mention John, whom, several weeks before our stay, actually arranged bookings for us at two very nice local restaurants, when trying to book anywhere myself proved impossible!

So all in all, I highly recommend a stay here and we will be back.

Many Thanks to all.",5,2021,07,04
214,Outstanding,"My sister and I stayed for one night. We were blown away on arrival by the welcome and fantastic customer service by John at reception.  The interiors of the hotel are unique, trendy but not over the top. The atmosphere in the hotel was calm and chilled. We loved our room- plenty space, bathroom was stunning. We had a cocktail in the bar which was delicious - would recommend the honey infused signature cocktail. The breakfast was top class, the afternoon tea style of the service was really special. Thanks so much to the staff who were so pleasant  and helpful.",5,2021,06,27
214,Incredible,"I visited for one night with my daughter. It surpasses other hotels in every way. It is unique, creative, attentive, luxurious in a non tacky way. The service is outstanding and all the staff genuinely give great service but not in a pushy way. Who ever trains them is a doing a,great job. The room we got we were upgraded to without asking, it was wow when we opened to the door. This leaves other hotels stood in the shadows. We whooped and whhoed upon arrival. The breakfast menu we photographed it was sooo good and when the food arrived we made more pleasurable noises! A cake stand arrived too  with special treats as well..  the hotel e experience leaves you feeling like you've been wrapped in the exquisite and nourished with care and beauty. Thank you so much The Wilder !!",5,2021,06,23
214,Post Covid weekend break,"It was great to get a break and what a little hotel. 
Decor Brilliant. Loads of little quirky touches. Truely boutique. Staff amazing and welcoming from entering and meeting Aleena. Got an upgrade on room booked, welcoming drink on arrival. Nice smart bar and garden and comfortable. Covid compliant making you feel safe.  10 min walk to shops on Grafton st. Leafy suburb beside the canal with peaceful walks. Will definitely be back",5,2021,06,22
214,Fabulous stay,"We stayed at the wilder townhouse for a short getaway, upon arrival welcomed by John who give us a brief history of the building very friendly  professional. Within a few mins of getting to our room, we received a call from Newman the on duty manager who just to check that our room was okay for us. Hotel and our room was decorated with beautiful curated art pieces and painting, making the whole experience unique almost like a gallery! Had a welcome tin and tonic, again being taken for the very attentive Newman. Room had air con and attention to detail was exceptional.
Location was excellent only a few mins walk to st Stephen green yet in a quiet area. Ameena provided some excellent recommendations for places to visit and helping us plan the day. 
Thoroughly enjoyable stay, can’t wait to come back.",5,2021,06,14
214,Fantastic,"The Wilder is in a fantastic location, just minutes from St Stephens Green & Grafton Street. The hotel itself is clean and stylishly decorated, our room was clean and cozy. The staff, from the moment you walk in the door, are nothing short of exceptionally friendly and helpful and it's a genuine helpfulness, they really are just nice people. Treat yourself, stay here.",5,2021,06,13
214,Fantastic!,Fantastic boutique hotel set in a beautiful and historic building. The place is spotlessy clean and the rooms are very well appointed and decorated beautifully. Bar and dining room are equally well done and breakfast was top class. The staff are super. Very friendly and helpful. Will definitely visit again and recommend to anyone.,5,2021,06,12
214,An incredible stay as always,This hotel is my favourite in the whole of Dublin City its exquisit decor and tentative staff make the hotel a delight from the moment you step inside. The breakfast is delicious & the rooms are  always designed beautifully. Thank you,5,2021,06,10
214,A Find!,"Three night in the Wilder was a treat from start to finish. Wasn't sure what to expect, but this boutique hotel is a find! Top marks for getting the most important thing right. The welcome. We were made to feel like treasured guests. From John, Barry and Alina at reception to the exceptional Rachel in the Dining Room and friendly, informative Harry in the bar, this small but perfectly formed hotel deserves a return visit. The breakfast is exceptional. Thank you for a lovely time.",5,2021,06,08
214,Staying here is an absolute must,Staying in the wilder was a fantastic experience from start to finish. Staff couldn't be more helpful and genuinely nice. Rooms were really comfortable and absolutely spotless. Loads of thoughtful touches to make our stay very special . We feel truly refreshed after our stay here and will be staying here for any future trips to Dublin.,5,2021,06,07
214,Treated like royalty,"I have been to many hotels in my time, but visiting The Wilder Townhouse has really opened my eyes to top class treatment. All the staff are welcoming, friendly, and treat you as if they've known you for years.

The room was fantastic, the decor was outstanding and the building ambiance was relaxing. I would thoroughly recommend to visit The Wilder if you are looking for a luxury stay with 5 star service.",5,2021,06,06
214,Loved it!!,"The best way to review is to say - can't wait to go back!

The recommendation from bar for wine was spot on and thank you for your suggestion on the eggnoc - it was delicious.

Breakfast is out of this world with a choice of dishes you won't get anywhere else and all cooked to order. The banana bread is to die for! 

Everyone was so friendly and the call from reception to room after we checked in, shows the genuine customer care they provide. 

I live locally, but wanted a night away from home as treat and the stay was exactly that - a big treat!! 

Quintin dú Plessis",5,2020,12,18
214,You should visit here,"The Wilder Townhouse hotel is fabulous. A classy townhouse renovated to an above  5 star standard, from the moment you enter you know your in for something a bit special.

The attention to detail is phenomenal. The very friendly staff and beautiful room with enormous ensuite & bath was a great start. 

A relaxed drink the the ""Gin Bar"" where complimentary mulled wine and mince pies were being served for Christmas, while looking out onto the beautiful Harcourt Terrace before venturing out for a meal into the fashionable Dublin City Centre / St. Stephen's Green area.

The breakfast the following morning was outstanding. A full selection of smoothies/granola, pastries, and two types of home made brown bread all arrived served on ""High tea"" stand and that was just the starter. This was followed by a choice of a full irish/ eggs benedict/ pancakes and much more.

I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough for business or pleasure it is a gem.",5,2020,12,14
214,Lovely hotel but Covid standards were pretty poor,"The hotel is lovely, ideal location and very friendly staff. BUT in a time when cleanliness is key, I found hygiene standards to be lacking. 

In the bar, the barman made our drinks after directly handling used glasses from a neighbouring table - I did not observe any hand washing or use of sanitiser during this period. Similarly, the menus were not wiped down after use and were not disposable. The table I was sitting at still had used placemats and were removed when the barman took our order. 

Based on where I was sitting I was able to see directly into the kitchen. On numerous occasions staff exited the kitchen into the bar area without any masks on and the wearing of masks was not adhered to within the kitchen based on what I observed. Unfortunately this remained the case for the breakfast period the following morning. Thankfully all over staff were wearing masks as required.  

When tables were being cleared staff did not appear to disinfect the tables and only appeared to wipe them down. 

It is such a shame that the standards are lacking because it made me feel uncomfortable in the hotel. Staff could not have been nicer and the bedroom and bathroom were very clean but overall my stay was not as enjoyable as I would have liked.",2,2020,12,14
214,Anniversary Treat!!,"Really stunning experience. Loved the building, history, staff, food, bar, everything!! The only issue is no dinner menu. Just Light Bites. Need to reserve elsewhere. Breakfast and lunch made up for it! Amazing. ",4,2020,10,12
214,Business stay,"I stayed here for one week of Dublin lockdown because I needed to be in the city everyday and have meetings and I wanted somewhere quiet where I could get work done.
This was a great option, clean and tidy, comfortable surroundings, lovely breakfast and very safe as there were few guests and it’s residents only.
The best part was the staff who are in all the years of staying in hotels exceptionally friendly and sincere. They make the Wilder a home from home.
The Wilder is very close to stephens green so if it’s peace and quiet and convenience you want with friendly staff, then you’ve found it here in The Wilder. 
My rating is 10/10",5,2020,10,07
214,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Myself and my partner stayed for a weekend in the Wilder Hotel and this was our second stay in this hotel and definitely will not be our last. We stayed in the Lady Jane suite and were blown away by how spacious and luxurious the room was. The bed was unbelievably comfortable and the suite comes with both bathtub and shower(water pressure is outstanding). 

We were greeted by Alannah at reception who was incredibly friendly and super helpful in getting us settled with recommended restaurants nearby. The breakfast in the morning was also amazing with so much variety in a beautifully decorated dining room. 

Would highly recommend this hotel and definitely plan on coming back again.",5,2020,10,05
214,Best Hotel in Dublin ,"This is my second stay in The Wilder Townhouse and I would be happy to return many more times. The city centre location is ideal. I’ve stayed in other hotels since the COVID-19 crisis and the Wilder has been the best stay. The staff are wonderful, they make you feel safe in the knowledge that they’re adhering to the guidelines without making you feel as though you are compromising your stay. They manage to stick to the guidelines while keeping the unique feel of The Wilder Townhouse alive. 

The hotel itself is impossible to fault. It feels like they’ve thought of everything you could want. I stayed in the Lady Jane suite and couldn’t recommend it enough. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom has both bath and (incredible!) shower. When we visited bars and restaurants in Dublin were closed except for outdoor dining. That was fine with us because between the gorgeous room and the great service in the bar we didn’t want to leave the hotel. 

Another high point was the breakfast. There was a great selection and they were very generous with the servings. 

I would definitely rate this hotel as 5 stars and hope to return for another visit soon. ",5,2020,10,04
214,Ideal Staycation Getaway,"Absolutely fabulous stay, we could not have been happier. The entire place is gorgeous, has a cool history and the rooms are beautifully decorated. The staff was so attentive, and the customer service was spot on from booking to checkout. The cocktails are delicious, be sure to try the Wilder and the Wilder Honey Bee. The location is also ideal, highly recommend for those visiting Dublin or those looking for a staycation getaway! We'll be back :)",5,2020,09,30
214,Marvelous stay!,"Last Saturday, my partner and I celebrated our anniversary at the Wilder. 
Upon arrival, we've been kindly greeted by Alannah, who surprised us with an amazing upgrade from a small to one of their popular rooms. 

When entering the room, we got surprised by a handwritten cards and some macarons. A very nice gesture, which made us immediately feel at home. 

The rooms, breakfast and service were all superb!! We would highly recommend the Wilder, and we can't wait to go back! Many thanks to Alannah, and the other staff members !

Kind regards,
Alexander and Jolien",5,2020,09,28
214,Tranquil getaway in Dublin,"I had the most  amazing stay in the Wilder Townhouse. I was greeted by John Farrelly who immediately made my sister and I  feel relaxed and welcome and ensured us not to hesitate to contact reception if needed. 

The reception is beautifully decorated with candles and  artwork you are completely taken in and charmed by this beautifully restored victorian Townhouse. 

I stayed in the lady Jane suite, which is absolutely stunning. The attention to detail in this hotel is nothing but amazing and makes your stay so special. 

The atmosphere in the bar was so relaxing , They had the nicest cheeseboards and cocktails and  we were extremely charmed by the attention to detail that went into naming the cocktails. 

Breakfast was beautifully presented and the variety was incredible . They cater to any dietary needs and ensure you are looked after. 

It was honestly the nicest hotel experience I have ever had, from the nicest, friendliest and most attentive  staff, to the beautfiul decor and to the tasteful music playlist whilst having cocktails in the bar. In these strange times switching off from reality whilst being absolutely comfortable in a spotlessly clean environment is most needed. The Wilder Townhouse really make you forget about your worries and pamper yourself.",5,2020,09,23
214,Charming and Oh so original!,"We recently stayed in The Wilder and from the moment we pulled in to the driveway we were totally charmed by everything about it!  Everything is so original and quirky in a fabulous way! The décor is unique and obviously this town house was put together with a lot of thought and love! We received a genuine welcome on arrival and the team here just can't do enough for you.  It was a lovely sunny evening and we had drinks outside on fabulous little tables while I dreamt of how I could bring some of this fabulous décor to life in my own garden...... I SO want the lady with the umbrella!! Breakfast was, yet again, unique ( and delicious with great choice) and it stood out from out from other hotels we have stayed in.  All very covid safe also.  Lovely comfortable room with again, little quirky things to make you smile. High quality bedlinen and really comfortable pillows....

214,Fantastic Hotel for a long weekend stay!,"I really cannot give this beautiful hotel enough praise!  But I will give it a go....We stayed here for our 10 year wedding anniversary, we were greeted with friendly smiles from all the staff, plus a complimentary drink on arrival :) our room was spotless, well equipped, stylish,  and the bed was dreamy!!  The service here is absolutely fantastic, nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff, I specifically want to give thanks to Ryan, Aleena, Neuman, John and Allanna, all were very friendly, and helpful in giving us tips on where to go, what to visit, how to get there etc, they made us feel at home, and we really couldn't have asked for any more!  The Wilder team really made our anniversary weekend a very memorable one, we hope to be back here one day, and I can totally recommend this place to anyone thinking of staying in Dublin, the location is also good a only a short 10 min walk from the centre and amenities.  Thank you Wilder team! :)",5,2020,09,14
214,Fab hotel for city break,"Stayed for 2 nights recently and very impressed with everything. Lovely staff, nice cocktails, love the decor and the garden. Small touches like macarons in the room were very nice. Dealt with 2 different Johns who were both very pleasant and professional. Close to town and walking distance to a wide variety of restaurants. Would love to stay again!",5,2020,09,12
214,Fabulous stay and exceptional staff.,"We stayed in The Wilder for one night last weekend and had a fabulous stay. We had booked a small double but the size was more than adequate. The bed was incredibly comfortable, the rain shower was amazing and loved the little touches such as the heated towel rail and stylish furnishings. The whole townhouse is exquisite and a great location.. The  cocktails were divine and breakfast was beautifully presented and so tasty.  We felt very safe for the duration with social distancing measures in place.

 However what really made this stay was the outstanding staff. Alannah at check in gave us a fabulous welcome and Numan provided an extremely friendly and professional service in the bar. I have to say all of the staff were just great and there was a lovely, warm atmosphere throughout. I have stayed in many hotels with work and this service was on another level.  I can see from previous complimentary reviews that this is consistent. We can't wait to come back!!",5,2020,09,10
214,30th Birthday Celebrations,This Hotel is fantastic and the staff are exceptional. They are so welcoming and helpful. I was so touched by the lovely birthday message that was left along with a plate of macaroons in my room. The bar is wonderfully spaced and it feels so relaxing even during these covid times. It felt like you can relax and escape from the hustle and bustle. Also the breakfast was phenomenal. The eggs Benedict were devine and the service was amazing. This truly is a hotel I would recommend to everyone. Everything is done to the letter and it feels safe and warm and welcoming. Also Alannah on front desk was brilliant. Cannot thank her enough. Thank you The Wilder for giving me a wonderful 30th Birthday to remember and cherish.,5,2020,09,08

214,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"I booked this hotel for a mother & daughter getaway to celebrate my 30th. I was suffering from a terrible heat rash and was struggling to enjoy my birthday celebrations but the staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful when we arrived and it made everything so much easier. The warm and friendly welcome put me in such a better mood and made my shopping day much more enjoyable. To top that off I found a lovely hand written welcome note and yummy macarons in the bedroom.  
Besides from the fantastic staff members the hotel is beautiful decorated and handling the covid restrictions in a very smart and innovative way.  This is by far the best hotel in Dublin and I can't wait for my next visit.",5,2020,08,25
214,50th birthday treat,"This boutique hotel in the heart of Dublin is a real hidden gem. 5 min stroll to the city centre. 
We booked a suite and were given the ‘pink’ Miss Sharp suite, we were more than impressed. The attention to detail in the fabric, furniture and fittings is superb. 
The staff are friendly, professional and very welcoming.
Breakfast was a real treat. Best eggs Benedict I have ever had.
This hotel isn’t the cheapest but is well worth it as a special treat. We can’t wait to return.

214,Truly Remarkable,"I booked this hotel for a special occasion and so glad i did. From check in to check out, the wilder and its staff made it a weekend to remember. The staff make the hotel what it is and that is a lovely warm and welcoming hotel. 

The rooms are great. I booked the suite as i heard other reviewers say rooms are on the smal size. You really get the old school vibes from the room which is great. Room comes with everything you need. Iron had to be requested which isnt an issue nor should it be.

We had breakfast in bed. It was made to order and absolutely delicious. 

Location is great, right in the heart of the city and within walking distance of everything. You really cant go wrong picking this hotel.",5,2020,08,17
214,Fantastic stay at The Wilder Townhouse,We stayed here in August for one night and it is easily one on the nicest hotels I've stayed in. The staff were super friendly and attentive. The ambiance and overall vibe throughout the hotel is wonderful and it is located in a quiet street within a few minutes walk of central Dublin. Would highly recommend.,5,2020,08,12

214,City Oasis,"We stayed in the Wilder two weekends ago and it was an oasis of calm.  The greatest asset of this property is the staff.  From check in to check out, the service was excellent.  Relaxed, welcoming and professional.  The rooms are tastefully decorated with quirky touches, the Replica complementary toiletries divine.  The breakfast deserves a special mention- tasty and fresh- cooked to order.  I am a coffee lover and the coffee was delicious- often something that lest a breakfast down.  Well done Wilder- we are booking again for another stay in September- see you then!!",5,2020,08,03
214,A wonderful boutique hotel,"This is a special place, intimate and friendly and lovely attention to detail. We felt incredibly welcome and the staff go the extra distance for guests. Won’t stay in another hotel when we visit Dublin! So glad we found The Wilder.",5,2020,07,29
214,Excellent hotel - Recommend you try it - Every member of staff was brilliant.,Hotel is well located just 5 minutes walk from St Stephens Green but in a quiet side street away from the nightclubs in Harcourt Street. All the staff were very helpful and friendly and the facilities were very clean. Nice quiet bar area and the breakfast was superb. I've been to Dublin many times and I would rate this as the best hotel I have stayed at in terms of value for money and quality.,5,2020,07,14
214,Fantastic service for engagement weekend ,"I stayed at the wilder for my girlfriends (now fiancée) 30th birthday and I can’t recommend staying here enough. When we checked in they upgraded us to the Miss Sharp suite as it was my girlfriend’s birthday weekend - Lovely room with a lounge area! I asked my girlfriend to marry me over a bottle of champagne in the room it so comfortable in there, and we will definitely be returning to relive this weekend in the years to come. 
Breakfast and the gin bar were fabulous & the staff are nothing but accommodating. 
The building is placed a perfect distance from the centre and a short walk to St. Stevens Green.  
There’s also a rooftop bar called Sophie’s a stones throw away that’s also a must visit with a 360 view of the city. 
Thanks to the wilder staff for making our weekend special ",5,2020,04,21
214,The perfect Townhouse in Dublin with Hospitality and comfort in Abundance,On arriving @ The town house we were greeted like royalty and offered refreshments in advance of our booking in.we also availed of a national concert hall which is very close by and the wilder town house combination package which was of excellent value .The rooms we stayed in were beyond comfortable and luxurious and we could have stayed in it for the duration of our 24 hour visit .before we left to go to our concert we were presented with a pre concert tray of goodies and a bottle of bubbly.on returning back to our room after the concert the curtains had been pulled for us the bed redressed and some yummy chocs on our pillows.The breakfast experience is beyond description and i have stayed in multiple hotels and guesthouses during my life but the wilder townhouse is the top of the list of cosy old world but modern charm and modern day comforts.A special thanks goes to the lovely receptionist Aleena and our wonderful breakfast waitress Carina who were so friendly and went to every effort to make our stay even more enjoyable and Carina went out of her way to help my wife prepare  her special breakfast mix .I Could go on praising the establishment to no end..But to finalise all i can say is keep up the good work and we shall return.,5,2020,02,24
214,Fantastic place to stay,Stayed at the Wilder over the Christmas season. I have to say everything from the location to the room to the breakfast was perfect. The staff were very helpful and professional. This is unique hotel in the heart of Dublin ,5,2020,02,17
214,Beautiful hotel with great staff ,"We have just come from staying 2 nights at the Wilder. Firstly, the welcome we received was lovely, so genuine and an instant uplift after a long journey with two young babies. 
Our suite was stunning, so well decorated and it was clear that real thought and care had gone into putting it together as there were several lovely touches. A travel cot was provided for us with no hassle at all (we also brought one of our own) and the room (the Miss Sharpe suite) accommodated two cots quite easily. 
Parking is free for residents (a rare bonus) and the hotel is located in walking distance of everything Dublin has to offer. It's also at the start of a cul de sac so is fairly quiet for a city hotel. 
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Wilder and would certainly book it again when visiting Dublin. 
Keep up the good work, Wilder Townhouse! ",5,2020,01,31
214,So happy The Wilder is on our corporate programme!,"Had the pleasure of staying at The Wilder last night and can’t wait for my next trip to Dublin in Feb so I can book it again. 
The hotel was very recently added to my company’s approved hotel list and I decided to give it a try. 
From the moment I stepped through the door yesterday evening I was made to feel at home. Every staff member, from front desk, to the manager I passed in the hall, the bar tender (who serves a perfect pint of Guinness) and waiting staff at breakfast today was a treasure. 

I stayed in a “popular” room, which was very spacious with a huge bathroom. The decor throughout is thought fully designed. I loved the individual touches. They achieved three things a lot of large corporate hotels do not. 1) Conditioner in the shower 2) a decent hairdryer 3) plenty of sockets by the bed for your electronics 

The little mini bar and coffee facilities are perfect and next time I stay I am getting up much earlier so I can spend hours over the stunning breakfast. I’d go back for the mini raspberry muffins alone. 

Note they do not serve a full dinner, but there is no shortage of restaurants within a short walk. ",5,2020,01,28
214,Beautiful hotel and great staff!,"Stayed in the Wilder Townhouse last weekend and had a great experience staying there. It is a great location very close to the Dublin City Centre with some fantastic restaurants and bars nearby. The staff there were incredibly friendly and very helpful in any request we had including the late check out which was very much appreciated!

We stayed in the Wade Suite on the second floor and the room was perfect. Checking in was hassle free and the member of staff on reception was incredibly kind as offering us complimentary drinks in the bar after checking in.

Couldn't recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be back!",5,2020,01,15
214,Amazing! ,"I recently stayed in this hotel for the second time recently. It is phenomenal. The location, the staff and service, the books by your bed, the comfy bed, the food. It is a brilliant hotel and I love staying here when I come home to Dublin. I can tie wait to stay again. ",5,2020,01,13
214,Fab Hotel in a Stunning & Central Location highly recommend,"Arrived at this charming Hotel nestled away in a beautiful location. So tastefully  decorated for Christmas with very quirky pieces in each of our bedrooms. So close to Bord Gais and even closer for shopping in Grafton St. From the welcome we received on our arrival to the farewell at our departure the staff at this Hotel were so lovely. highly recommend a stay at this Hotel, it has it all Uniqueness, Style, Charm and Comfort  close to the City with the quietness of the Countryside. This Hotel has it all.",5,2020,01,04
214,Charming Little Gem in Dublin!,"In October of 2019, my wife and I decided to stop in Dublin for a few days on our way to visit our oldest daughter who lives in Madrid, Spain. We’ve never been to Dublin so we were looking forward to our visit. After much research, we decided on The Wilder Townhouse…and we were so glad that we did! What a find in Dublin! This small boutique gem was absolutely wonderful. First, what a great time we had in Dublin. Unfortunately, our stay was short so we never ventured out of Dublin's city center. It was wonderful! We enjoyed some excellent food as well as, of course, a pint or three of Guinness! We had the best pour at The Long Hall pub (and we tried quite a few!). Great decor and absolutely the creamiest Guinness. We found locals to be extremely inviting and friendly. As for the hotel, it exceeded our expectations in every way. From the beautiful room to the cozy bar/eating area, excellent breakfasts, delicious scones, great location, and wonderful staff! Even the eating establishment recommendations were spot-on. A very special thanks to the staff, especially, Leona, Voychek, John, Hugo, and Cian who went above and beyond to ensure that our stay was magical. We can't wait to return!",5,2020,01,03
214,Friendly and comfortable,"Everyone told us, don't bother with Dublin -just go visit the West of Ireland.  Dublin is boring.  Wrong! Dublin was charming and quite lively. It had a younger vibe than I had expected.  Everyone was super friendly and the food surprisingly good.  The visit was made even more memorable by staying at the Wilder -- great location, comfortable and lovely staff.    ",5,2019,12,31
214,Nice boutique hotel,"Modern and cosy boutique hotel a 10-minute wall from the centre of town. Very comfortable and clean rooms, lovely bar, helpful staff, good breakfast. We had a lovely weekend. Not really much more we could have asked for. ",5,2019,12,29
214,Lovely hotel in great location ,We stayed for 1 night. Limited parking available but we arrived early and got parked outside the front door. Location is ideal in a quiet residential area and yet only a 10 minute walk to Stephen's green. The hotel room is probably the smallest room I've ever stayed in but we had everything we needed and it was cosy. I have to agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of wardrobe in the room the few hanging hooks are fine for a 1 night stay but would struggle if staying for longer. The hotel is spotless and the staff are lovely. We didn't have breakfast so I can't comment on the food.,4,2019,12,29
214,Quirky townhouse!,Great stay at this cosy & quirky townhouse. The atmosphere is so relaxing especially enjoying a gin and tonic or glass of wine in the bar and there are beautiful details everywhere (homemade cookies and quirky design features in the bedroom). We really enjoyed our stay.,5,2019,12,22
214,City break to the capital,"Superb hotel. Great staff & an ideal location for shopping, theatre or sight seeing.
Room decor was very relaxing & pleasing. Bar area very friendly. Loved the chocs on the bed at night time & of course Oscar Wilde book on the pillow. Lovely touches in lots of different ways.
Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,12,13
214,Appearances aren't everything,"Pretty good location, not far from St. Stephen's Green. Clean and tidy, with a private bar/restaurant. Decent breakfast. Some truly lovely, kind staffers. Others far too familiar. Too many pillows and nick nacks in tiny rooms. Too little space for hangers. Far too much emphasis on show - like folding Kleenex flowers and serving tepid coffee in a little French presses. Not nearly enough emphasis on substance, like hot coffee and making sure there's tissue in the box before topping it off with a flower. Or even emptying the trash. If it's any better when I must return I'll write a glowing review.",4,2019,12,11
214,The Perfect Boutique Hotel in Dublin,"I was so pleased with my stay at the Wilder Townhouse in Dublin and found the perfect hotel for me. If you like small, design hotels, then the Wilder is for you. 

It is in a beautifully restored brick townhouse a short walk from St. Stephen's Green and the main attractions of central Dublin. The staff was uniformly warm, welcoming, and helpful. There is a really lovely breakfast room, and you can start the day with a buffet of fresh pastries and a variety of yogurts and fresh fruits and complimentary newspapers. There is also a cozy, attractive bar adjacent where you can have a drink or light snacks. There is not a full dinner or lunch menu, but the selection of sandwiches, salads, and cheese plates from the light menu were just fine for a stay of a few days.

The entire hotel is beautifully designed and comfortable. I felt very relaxed there. My only criticism is that there is only a bar to hang clothes with a few hangers in the room and only two tiny drawers in the night stands, so it is impossible to hang up your clothes. I don't think the decision to eliminate a closet in the small, but well appointed rooms was a good one.

Nonetheless, I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The Wilder and its staff really enhanced my experience of Dublin.",5,2019,12,08
214,Rooms do not have space for hanging clothes!,"We booked 6 nights to stay at The Wilder and on arrival realised our room was very, very small. There were 4/5 hooks on the wall for hanging clothes. Each hook could only accommodate one hanger. We were going to a big 2 day wedding and immediately told the staff we couldn’t hang up our clothes. They showed us another room ( a Popular Room ) which was one of their largest. We decided there and then that we had to leave - we had to pay for 2 nights but only stayed the first night. ( it was too late to leave and find another hotel) It was a bit grating that we had to pay 185 euros per night - I think it would have been gracious of the hotel to release us and only pay for the one night. On the plus side the hotel is stylish and the staff are lovely - but stay if you’ve got a big suitcase or want to hang up clothes!",2,2019,12,05
214,Perfect in every way .,"Absolutely loved everything about The Wilder Townhouse from the moment we got there until the moment we left.The décor, little touches, attention to detail, ambience and staff friendliness all contribute to raising this establishment to another level, it rightly deserves all the accolades and recognition it is receiving. It’s location is perfect with Grafton Street and lots of Dublin’s hotspots only a short stroll away. Wish we had been staying longer.",5,2019,12,02
214,Great Townhouse in heart of Dublin,"Stayed as a family with 2 rooms for one night. Great location a few mins walk from Stephen’s Green. Staff so nice, welcoming and helpful. Rooms are small but decorated beautifully and have personality from the house’s interesting history. Breakfast was really nice and we had some lite bites before a show, just what we needed. Lovely stay, we will be back.",5,2019,12,01
214,Unique & charming hotel,"I recently stayed in this hotel for 1 week and I can’t recommend it highly enough. 

It’s a boutique hotel with plenty of character and charm which made a welcome change from regular hotel chain properties. 

The owners of the property did an exceptional job on the renovation and the interior design. It’s so cosy and welcoming when you enter. 

All staff and management that I met were  extremely friendly and welcoming and made me feel at home. There was a more personal service than you get in other larger hotels. 

Breakfast is cooked fresh to order. I tried a couple of different dishes and all were delicious. There is an excellent buffet selection also with some nice extras like banana bread and charcuterie that you don’t get in other hotels. 

There is currently some building work being carried out across the street but I heard no noise throughout my stay. 

The Wilder is a little gem in the city centre and is in a convenient location for shopping and exploring the city. ",5,2019,11,30
214,The Wilder drive me wild,"Where do I start .. the warm welcome at reception was lovely and the decor is quirky.  This time of the year taste full Christmas decorations.  Our room was beautiful,  big spacious bed sheer comfort a great night sleep. The coffee machine is such a nice touch. The bathroom very spacious and massive bath in it. The rain shower was heaven. We would have loved to have another night here and will most certainly be coming back. Close to all areas also. Car parking limited but very handy . ",5,2019,11,29
214,Charming place in the heart of Dublin city,"A business trip was made super special this week staying at the Wilder, what a charming place! My room was beautiful, breakfast great and the staff amazing. Only a short walking distance from St Stephen's Green and Luas stop - very convenient.",5,2019,11,28
214,Highly recommended ,"On my recent visit to The Wilder Townhouse 22 Adelaide Road, Dublin 2.
I would highly recommend it, the customer service, the welcome and the ambience of the place is excellent. The Wilder Townhouse is in the ideal location for business, shopping and entertainment.
Best of luck for the Future",5,2019,11,28
214,Fantastic place and fantastic people!,"This hotel is beautiful. The interior design is stunning. The rooms are very comfortable and well designed. It was quiet at night and I slept very well.I loved the proper china cups and saucers - a lovely touch.
The hotel is in a quiet area of the city, but you can walk to Grafton Street in under 15 minutes. 
We breakfasted twice at the hotel and it was superb. there was fantastic service and excellent quality ingredients. One of our party was vegan and that was no trouble at all.
The best thing about The Wilder Townhouse is the staff. Every single staff member that we met was friendly and helpful. We were helped with directions and taxis. Nothing was too much trouble and people went over and above to make our stay a comfortable one.
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2019,11,26
214,You've got me going wild with compliments,"As soon I walked into the Wilder I knew it was special. the leafy street, the noble, perfectly  restored building.... 
And when I walked in, the art on the walls showed that this place had a certain style. 
My room was appointed in a modern yet cosy style, the amenities were top and the whole feel was one of comfort. 
One big plus were the many pillows, that are assortment of types,whether you like soft and downy or hard and high, they are all here for you. 
Breakfast was exceptional, a continental or a cooked to order hot breakfast was everything I could have wanted. 
All this is nothing without a wonderful staff.   Everyone I encountered could not do enough for me, and with a friendly smile. 
The management must be commended for putting together such a great team.
You made my three day visit to Dublin so pleasant! 
Thank you all!",5,2019,11,24
214,Happy to spend my first night in Ireland here,"excellent service,  coffee or tea with a fresh cookie is a great way to be welcomed after travelling over night.  the location was a bit tricky to find (driving on the opposite side of the road) lol  the rooms were small but cozy and the location is great to get to see some of Dublins major tourist attractions.    Everyone we dealt with was so kind, the little bar servers and staff are so warm and sincere.  Would highly recommend even with the noise of the construction going on in the AM",5,2019,11,07
214,Small and cozy but SUPER noisy,"It would score well as it is somewhat a boutique hotel , small but nice rooms, good beds , clean, decent bathrooms, kind staff. But... they forgot to install any glass on windows (the usual excuse of old building protected by cultural heritage - in truth working out a custom solution for these windows would be possible but expensive so here nobody cares) . Open or closed makes no difference, so *much* road noise on all floors. It’s not a busy area at night but It’s still like being on the sidewalk together with the passing cars. Good luck getting any sleep while counting cars not sheep. ",2,2019,11,06
214,Staff excellent,"Lovely place to stay. Service excellent. The staff very friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. 
Rooms lovely.
To make even better staff checking tea, coffee etc in room all in place and that if supposed to have in room bar there is one. 
Would thoroughly recommend.",4,2019,11,03
214,Really good time,Really great hotel can’t fault it the staff really helpful young lad in the bar lastnight very easy going and the man at reception rang us a taxi whenever needed nothing was too much trouble would definitely recommend hopfully come back again one day!,5,2019,11,03
214,Amazing in every way.,"I loved everything about my stay. The beautiful outside sitting area, the warm welcome from the 2 johns on arrival, the professionalism and history about the townhouse I got from John on arrival, the cute cups and friendly chit chat with Rachel in the gin and tonic room. I stayed in Miss Sharp suite ever inch of the suite was quirky and felt warm and welcoming I love the little fire places and the bed was too comfortable I never wanted to leave. The products in the washroom are gentle and fresh on the skin. I had great recommendations from both Cian and Leona at the bar. Being a solo traveller they made time for me I felt like I was amongst friends and was a great start to my night. The townhouse itself is so beautiful and intimate. Being a resident only townhouse you know that they are going to take care of you with any of your needs or queries, this townhouse would suite anyone solo, couples, corporate. Ye really made me feel like a Queen I really appreciate my stay and will definitely be back and am currently reccomending it to everyone. Thank you.",5,2019,10,31
214,Booked with travel agent,"After looking at several ""hotels"" in similar price range located near St. Stephen's Green we decided on the Wilder.
Charming little ""hotel"" with a history, across the road from the Ear/Eye Hospital.
Not particularly close to a lot of restaurants and pubs/bars which was great because this was central and quiet. Restaurants within walking distance.
Our room was great, 301 twin/king, some smaller, en suites adequately equipped and totally comfortable, staff/service perfect, breakfast available as is afternoon tea, drinks, cheese etc. Hop-on hop-off busses across the Green, Grafton Street, Trinity and Temple Bar within walking distance.
Have recommended this to friends since our return only 2 weeks ago.
Would return.",5,2019,10,15
214,Very nice accommodations if you book the right room,"We stayed at the Wilder Townhouse twice. The first time, because rooms were scarce due to a soccer game, we had a king bed (European king equals American queen) small room. It felt very cramped and since we arrived after an all night flight, we had to wait for the room. But when we came back we had a classic twin room which was a very nice room with 2 twin beds next to each other. They left us chocolate and a fairy tale book to read. The location is 2 blocks from the National concert hall, close to St. Stephens park and close to the tram that takes you to the city center. Best to include breakfast which was a choice of hot breakfasts plus a buffet",4,2019,10,12
214,"Wonderful staff, beautiful location and very comfortable accommodation.","The reception at the hotel was warm and welcoming We were assisted by many of the staff and their interest in us having a wonderful experience was genuine. Hugo, especially helped us out with all our inquiries, large and small. Many thanks to all the staff that we met. 
The accommodations were tasteful and great care was taken to make us feel like we were in a family home. This included suggested nighttime reading.
The townhouse is located in a quiet location but within walking distance of everything you would want to see in Dublin. A lovely stay!",5,2019,10,08
214,Really enjoyed our stay here,"We moved here after 5 B&B stays across the country and it was just what we needed. A bit of an upscale city hotel, but it was on a quiet street that made us feel like we were miles away from downtown Dublin. Cab rides were easy to schedule, food was very good, and the bar made us feel welcome.",5,2019,10,06
214,Quirky and different hotel,"We had a fantastic stay - the hotel is immaculate and the staff are friendly, helpful and are a credit to the owners and management.Breakfast was superb with a wide range and cooked to perfection. The room was excellent with all the extras you could want - we had a suggested bed time read with our chocolates! I cant recommend this place enough.",5,2019,09,30
214,Communication,"We are traveling with friends from New York. Place is lovely. Location is great. Each room is unique to the age of the building.   Issue we had is with communication.  We called from st stevens square asking what time their bar closed.  We were told 11:30.  So we rushed back to hotel. Arrived at 11:03 to be told bar closed at 11.  The front desk employee didn’t seem to acknowledge that the other employee made a mistake , nor did he try to accommodate us.  A bit disappointing for the class this hotel is trying to be. We are coming back next week for a night and definitely want to hear from the hotel manager",2,2019,09,29
214,"Friendly, stylish hotel in great location","Stayed for one night when in town for a gig at Vicar St. The Wilder is a very beautiful hotel, we loved the style and the breakfast room in particular is beautiful with lovely fresh flower displays. The hotel rooms were quiet (even when fully booked as was the case on our stay) so could definitely recommend for a restful nights sleep. The breakfast was delicious and the waiting staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Particular mention to the lovely waitress from the US who made us feel very welcome. Location wise it was just a few minutes walk from St Stephens Green and Grafton St shopping. We got a free on site parking space too which was great. Would definitely stay again in the future.

214,Perfect in every way,"Beautiful hotel full of small details everywhere, located within walking distance of all the attractions Dublin has to offer.  Amazing staff  willing to go an extra mile to make your stay perfect. Probably the best breakfast I have had in a hotel.
Many thanks for making our trip unforgettable",5,2019,09,26
214,A Wonderful Mix of History and Hospitality,"With its storied history as a home for retired governesses and its styllish transformation into a boutique hotel, The Wilder Townhouse has quickly become one of my favorite places to stay. The decor is well-considered, with plenty of charming touches like the “Alice In Wonderland” tea set in the room and collection of books by the bed (including an Oscar Wilde bio and a few vintage Penguin paperbacks). This is a great choice for traveling adult couples, but probably not the spot for families with rambunctious children.  The small double room we were in was compact, but perfectly fine for two adults.

The service was impeccable, from manager to front desk to restaurant staff. Speaking of the restaurant, the Wilder's Gin & Tea Rooms offer a tasty breakfast in the morning and a fine selection of local gins and cheese in the evening after you've been out exploring Dublin all day. The hotel's location is far enough away from the main tourist areas so you can avoid the noise of the partying crowds in Temple Bar, but it's only about a five-minute walk up an adjacent street to get to the south end of St. Stephen's Green and a few minutes farther to the shopping on Grafton Street.

In all, a thorougly enjoyable experience and definitely the place I play to stay the next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2019,09,18
214,Lovely hotel,"we thought the Wilder Townhouse was a lovely place to stay. It is a beautiful old building, restored to perfection with a cool vibe. The rooms are small, but beautifully appointed. The bathrooms and shower were superb. The breakfast room and breakfasts were outstanding. There is not real lobby for sitting, so this is something to consider if that is important. There is however a beautiful garden outside for sitting when the weather is nice. The hotel is nicely located, a little outside of the center so it is very quiet but is a short walk to St. Stephen Square. We recommend this hotel without hesitation.",4,2019,09,17
214,My favourite hotel (and an unbelievably delicious breakfast!),"We visited the Wilder for two day at the start of a ten day trip to Ireland and Scotland. We were warmly welcomed and brought to the loveliest room upon arrival. We chose a shoebox room which was perfect. The decor, the bed, the finishes - everything was just perfect and carefully thought out. We had a tall window with a nice view of the neighbourhood from our room. The interior of the hotel is beautifully decorated - a perfect mix of modern along with honouring all the features of an historic property. They have a fantastic art collection you'll notice throughout.

Staff at the little front desk were very helpful in recommending whatever we wanted. They provided advice and directions on how to get to the airport in the middle of the night when we had to catch a very early flight - they even made us a breakfast to take on the bus with us when they realized we were leaving earlier than expected. They went above and beyond and show they truly care about their guests.

The location of the hotel is fabulous. Tucked into a cosy street so you feel like you're staying in a Dublin neighbourhood rather than right downtown. The great thing is that you're within walking distance to everything you'll need! We took the bus from the airport which was quite easy to get to.

My favourite part of the Wilder experience was the lovely breakfast room and the most delicious breakfast we had our our trip. I had a vegetarian full irish breakfast along with several yummy pastries, breads, cheese and fruit from their breakfast table. DELICIOUS! I also want to compliment the team who provides the breakfast service - the young woman who served us was such a professional and made us feel special. In fact, all the staff that we met with during our stay were just as great. You obviously care about your employees and in return, they treat your guest like gold. 

I am a picky traveller and I will honestly say that The Wilder is in my top 3 hotels I've stayed in around the world. I wish I had occasion to go back soon. When I do visit Dublin again I will plan for a special stay at the Wilder. My only regret is that we didn't find the time to sit down and have a gin. Next time!",5,2019,09,12
214,My favourite hotel in Dublin,"We stay in Dublin pretty often and this is absolutely my favourite hotel by far. The location is fantastic- close to everything but in a leafy area away from the crowds. The rooms are really thoughtfully decorated. We went for a suite, which was lovely. The only criticism I have is that the bathroom is very small. The staff were very nice and helpful. I loved that they provided access to complimentary scones in the afternoon. I can't comment on the breakfast as we always go to Brother Hubbards, also not far from this hotel, for a delicious breakfast when we are in Dublin.",5,2019,09,12
214,A homely guesthouse in wondeful Dublin,"We stayed in this charming hotel on our first ever Dublin visit. Our expectations were certainly exceeded, this hotel was better value than the surrounding choices. Spacious rooms which were very clean, Bar menu limited with food choices but the breakfast was outstanding, we were looked after by Leona(?) who was very cheerful and delighted to provide recommendations of Dublin. Would not hesitate in returning again. Thank you!",5,2019,09,10
214,"Lovely fun decor, and excellent service","I was only able to stay at the Wilder for one night on my way out of town after biking for eight days in the west of Ireland. But I would certainly go back. Often in boutique hotels this chic, the staff is aloof and unfriendly. Not so here! They were efficient, warm, and welcoming. The breakfast is meticuously laid out, and very tasty. And the design is impeccable and unique. I am in the book trade and was so pleased to see a volume of Oscar Wilde's short stories left on my bed next to the mints at turn-down time. A lovely touch!",5,2019,09,09
214,Amazing boutique hotel,"I travelled to Dublin for business and picked the Wilder based on location, but I'll definitely be back. I loved the amenities and decor, and the service was top notch. Clean and comfortable, they embraced the details such as nightly turn-down service with a book and candies left on the bed for me. Great property!",5,2019,09,08
214,Simply the Best!,This is s truly beautiful place to stay. My room was both beautiful & comfortable. The service was outstanding!!! Breakfast was wonderful. And  it’s close enough for you to simply walk into the main attractions. Worth god Euros spent.,5,2019,09,08
214,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"Top notch terrific hotel. The entire staff was so friendly, helpful, professional and courteous. We had a suite and it was wonderful. Everything was sparkling clean. The decor is eclectic, fun and well done. We loved having breakfast in the garden room and a gin and tonic at the bar at the end of the day relaxing after touring around Dublin. So happy we booked our stay in Dublin here - loved it!",5,2019,09,05
214,Wonderful stay ,We are still staying in this wonderful Boutique Hotel nearly in the heart of Dublin . The staff is super friendly and we are enjoying every minute here. The breakfast is stunningly good with a fantastic coffee and the atmosphere in the breakfast room is warm and cosy . Tomorrow is my boyfriends 50th birthday. Let’s see if they congratulate. Than the hotel would earn 6 stars :-))   I am shire we will come back. Reinhard ,5,2019,08,31
214,Perfect in Every Way,"I stayed three nights at the Wilder and was thrilled and appreciative with all aspects of my stay. The staff was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and worked hard to be sure I was comfortable.  Everyone from housekeeping, front desk, bar and food, breakfast staff and the managers made my stay a memorable one. The full Irish breakfast was the best during my stay in Ireland. The rooms and lobby were so nicely decorated with great artwork, interesting reads and comfortable beds with lovely linens.  I enjoyed sitting outside in the courtyard and love this location for restaurants, museums and a walk along the canal. The Luas transit is a step away.  Definitely a repeat for me!!",5,2019,08,31
214,Romantic Getaway for the All Ireland ,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here in the most magnificent boutique style hotel on the day of the All Ireland Hurling Final. 

We were greeted with the most genuine friendliest welcome from the gorgeous receptionist and staff. Everybody took great interest in ensuring our stay was perfect.

The Wilder is the most beautiful Victorian style hotel. It is elegant with stunning red bricks on the exterior. It is so peaceful, tranquil and relaxing. A wonderful getaway for a romantic weekend.

As you walk into the entrance you will notice the beautiful patio gardens which immediately grabs your attention and you sense that welcoming WOW. 

The most important element I noticed was the level of hospitality, professionalism and the attention to detail all staff members offered. As I was somewhat incapacitated the staff over exceeded their level of duty to offer me the excellent customer service.

Our bedroom was the most beautifully decorated room I have ever stayed in. The Victorian style is so sophisticated.

Simply put, we were offered 7 class service in The Wilder Townhouse. It exceeded my expectations and I for sure will be returning again. 

My complements to the manager and staff.",5,2019,08,23
214,Perfect Luxury Break ,"The Wilder Hotel is an oasis of calm and beauty in a tastefully converted heritage building on a quiet Dublin street. 

Staff immediately make you feel welcome & are very helpful and attentive. 

The decor is a tasteful mix of contemporary & vintagewith relaxing colours & luxurious soft furnishings. 

It is the details which make The Wilder stand out: the book of Oscar Wilde short stories secreted in a drawer for you to read, the outdoor tables surrounded by flowers, Martin Margiela products in the bathrooms. 

Breakfast is served in a light filled room, fresh, generous, delicious & cooked to order. 

The location is very convenient to the City Centre but there is no noise & you will sleep deeply in a comfortable bed. 

We enjoyed our stay immensely & highly recommend The Wilder. ",5,2019,08,19
214,Eye for detail,"We stayed four nights at The Wilder and had a wonderful experience. It is true that all fine details have been considered with respect to the well-appointed rooms and use of space. Staff were courteous and friendly, the bed was very comfortable, and the rooms were quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2019,08,17
214,"Good location and friendly, professional staff, but!","Stayed here in two rooms for three nights with my wife and son.
The property opened last year and is located within a ten minute walk to St Stephens Green / Grafton Street areas.
it is tastefully decorated in a chic, boutique style but it is slightly missing the mark in the style stakes as it's trying to be like Soho Townhouse or the Hoxton which it is not, but not a bad attempt.
The rooms are reasonably appointed however no wardrobes anywhere apart from some wall hanging space and no irons.
The staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2019,08,15
214,Lovely weekend option,"Enjoyed 3 nights here - great location (10-15 min walk from St Stephen’s Green), beautifully done interiors, lovely staff and breakfast v good too. Our initial room was a bit small, so they kindly switched us to 311 which is a good one. Adelaide Road is a bit noisy during the day but goes quiet at night. Overall, a really good boutique option. Thanks to the staff for making us so welcome. ",5,2019,08,14
214,Perfect location near St Stephens green!,"Loved our stay at the wilder. This was the perfect place to recover after flying into to Dublin airport. Cute brownstone building off a main road. Has first come first serve parking! So rare and perfect added bonus. Our room was a suite on the 2nd floor. Perfect size for the three of us. Loved the bar, afternoon pastries, the grounds and outdoor seating area as well. We will definitely be back when passing through Dublin! If you’re looking for a super clean, classic and quiet stay just a short walk from st Stephens green and temple bar area this hotel is perfect. Super comfy cozy bed as well. ",5,2019,08,10
214,Unique style and luxe comfort without an ounce of stuffiness,"As a Marriott member, I was originally going to book one of the few Marriott properties, but somehow I found The Wilder and every other hotel pales in comparison now. Overview: lovely staff, wonderful and delicious little tea room/bar, a quiet outdoor area, peaceful neighborhood with nary a tourist in site, delightful style touches in every square inch and luxurious comfort in the rooms themselves that I missed the second I had to change hotels. 

Location: Excellent. It’s closer to the canal than the Liffey, but that’s what makes it great. You’re a 15 min. walk to the tourist spots, less than 10 to the great Camden Road with all its food and pub choices, and less than 5 mins to the canal, which is a surprise in the scheme of things. There are bike and running paths along it and I highly recommend hitting up The Barge for food and drinks. 

Property: Gorgeous. It’s set away from the street, an oasis of style and calm. And I don’t know who built/designed the property, but I want them designing my next house because it’s just quirky enough to be interesting but not overdone in any way. Fantastic design, colors, textiles, the lot. And it is PRISTINE. It was just immaculate.

Room: Oddly awesome. I say “odd” because it is definitely different. My room, which was a larger suite (I was there a week and needed space), came equipped with a small fridge, coffee/tea facilities, a bathroom you could dance in, a huge bed, and a table and chairs for eating/drinking. However, it was NOT equipped for a digital professional like myself — this is unique to my situation, so I won’t fault them, but I had to work in the bar downstairs almost every night. There are worse places to work! :) Other than that, the linens, towels, appointments were all top-notch and again, the room was immaculate. And not just on the first day. All the days. There was not a speck of dust in the place. The little touches of tea, coffee, treats, etc. were nice. There’s no wardrobe or closet, I will point out. At least in my suite. I stored my clothes in a cabinet in the bathroom. As I said, “odd”. 

Bar/Food: Fantastic. The bar is cozy but well-appointed. On any given night, you can get a glass of gin or a beer and a small bite of something. It’s not a full service restaurant at night. I didn’t mind this, but if you’re looking for dinner in the evening at your hotel, look elsewhere. Or, you know, just stay here and walk up to Camden and eat at Pickle. The breakfast in the morning is stellar. Typical Irish/B&B fare, but turned up a notch. Fresh jams and baked goods, organic granola, fresh fruits, and the hot breakfast choices are frickin fantastic. Even the scrambled eggs were gorgeous altogether. Also the staff is great. I don’t recall the name of the sweet girl who worked the mornings but she was on top of it and managed to be friendly and easy-going at the same time. 

Amenities: Average. It’s a boutique hotel. There is not a gym or pool. And that’s just fine. Wifi is strong and plentiful. See above about bar/food. They have a great laundry service that I appreciated as I had been traveling for weeks. If they don’t have what you need, or can’t provide it, I have faith that the stellar staff will do whatever they can to help. 

Price/Value: Great. Hotels closer to the center are twice as expensive and not nearly as well-done. I had to check in to a different hotel to meet with friends and it was closer to St. Stephen’s, about 100 Euros more and, quite frankly, barely held its face together. The Wilder runs less than those hotels and is an infinitely better value for your dollar. 

I would highly recommend staying at this gorgeous property. And try the Bertha gin with juniper berries and grapefruit. You won’t regret it.",5,2019,08,03
214,Best Hotel in Dublin by far,Understated elegance interesting history. Eclectic art. Authentic friendly staff beautiful decor wonderful well presented food brilliant position Why would you choose to stay any where else in Dublin?,5,2019,08,02
214,Exceptional,"The Wilder was a pleasant surprise. Located in a quiet area, but easy walking distance to a number of restaurants and shops. The two rooms we booked were very clean, and their decor was stylish and unique. The property has a lovely small cafe/bar with indoor and outdoor seating for breakfast or snacks and drinks.",5,2019,07,31
214,Beautiful Hidaway!,"The Wilder Townhouse is located on Adelaide Road, near the Grand Canal. It is a lovely, quaint hotel, beautifully decorated inside and out. A very efficient and friendly staff take care of your needs! A delicious breakfast is served each morning. A late night drink at the end of the day is also available in their bar lounge.You are in walking distance of many attractions. The Dublin Bike rack is located outside the hotel. You can easily rent a bike and ride along the canal bike path. You can drop off the bikes at another location.",5,2019,07,29
214,Beautiful! Full of character ,I loved everything about our stay at this hotel! The hotel itself is full of character and I was really impressed with all of the artwork displayed around the place. Whoever decorated this place did an amazing job. It doesn’t have that usual boring hotel feel about it. There are lovely fresh flowers around the place too. The breakfast was delicious and tasted homemade and fresh. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Service was excellent and the air conditioning in the room was an added bonus!! I’m already looking forward to my next visit and will be recommending to friends and family.,5,2019,07,27
214,Exceptional!,"The Wilder Townhouse is so great you get the impression they have done extremely detailed research into what makes the perfect hotel experience for a guest and applied it with such care that they absolutely have got it down pat.
The rooms are tastefully decorated and very modern and unique. Gorgeous selection of shampoos,conditioner,shower gels & body cream. Excellent friendly & welcoming staff ,and the location is just perfect -a very beautiful part of Dublin. 
This hotel has a lot going for it ,I fully expect it will find itself in the top 20 hotels in Dublin soon enough ,it is a different hotel experience to the 'same old' you would expect most of the time ,and this serves as it's strong point. I fully recommend The Wilder to all",5,2019,07,23
214,Stunning,This is a beautiful hotel of just 42 rooms and run extremely well. It is well appointed and well staffed. The Bar/Breakfast are is perfect and is just for hotel guests. 5 min walk to St Stephens Green. I highly recommend this lovely hotel. ,5,2019,07,06
214,Beautiful hotel and lovely surroundings,A beautiful boutique hotel in lovely surroundings. The attention to detail and the decor was great. The location is very good and on site parking was a huge plus. The staff were friendly and helpful. I only wish I could have stayed longer. ,5,2019,07,04
214,Hidden gem,Extremely happy with the Wilder. Rooms are clean and well maintained. Staff is great!! Gave us great places to eat and see. Really helpful when we arrived early. Definitely will go back!! Away from the busy tourist areas but easy walk!!,5,2019,06,30
214,Excellent!! ,"We stayed here for two nights and it was great. Hotel locates in a leafy quiet neighbourhood but within walking distance to city centre and Trinity college. The hotel is tastefully decorated with modern and cool cosmopolitan style. The bedroom is very comfy. The shower room is so spacious that we put the luggage there. Breakfast is amazing, in a green flowery glass-roof lounge. Overall a very pleasant stay, will definitely stay here again if we visit Dublin again. ",5,2019,06,27
214,Service Topnotch! Boutique Experience,"My experience at the Wilder was positively impacted by the fabulous staff. They were super attentive, even greeting me by name during my brief 2 night stay. The room, though small had a firm mattress, lovely bedding and eclectic decor - loved the heated towel rack. I pack a travel yoga mat and had no problems doing my morning routine in the room. The team working at the hotel quickly brought an iron when requested, offered restaurant suggestions that afforded a lovely walk. I'd stay here again in a minute",4,2019,06,27
214,What a pretty quirky property ,"Loved loved loved the property! The quirky artifacts all over! The cute, gorgeous, well appointed rooms, warm and welcoming folks at the reception and the restaurant, great food.. what more can one ask for! The kids and us loved The Wilder! I wish I had taken some pictures of the quirky stuff kept around the hotel! 

The hotel is very close to Stephens Green and is a short walk to Grafton Street! It’s all positive positive positive about the place! ",5,2019,06,25
214,Beautiful place to stay ,"We stayed for two nights at the weekend and couldn’t fault it.
A warm welcome from reception staff with plenty of local knowledge. 
Beautiful building, feels luxurious and quirky without being elitist or stuffy.
Lots of period features with modern touches too- all very well thought through and presented.
Spotlessly clean and well equipped. 
Super comfy bed and the bathroom was gorgeous. 
Location is excellent for wandering through st Stephen’s green and into the main shopping/bar area. 
We will definitely book again when we come back to fabulous Dublin! ",5,2019,06,24
214,Excellent,"This hotel provides a sense of luxury at a decent price. The staff are extremely polite,  welcoming and helpful,  including the reception area,  bar, room service and manager.

It is tastefully decorated with many attractive and quirky details. The beds are very comfortable with good quality bedding and pillows . There is a good supply of toiletries, great coffee and tea with homemade biscuits and sugar sticks in the room.  It's spotlessly clean with a turn down service. 

Simple food is available in the bar at a reasonable price. It is located a short walk from St.Stephens Green.  The 700 bus for the airport stops close by.  

We'll definitely be back if we return to Dublin.",5,2019,06,21
214,One of my favorite stays in Ireland (slash ever),"I never write reviews, but this place was so special that I wanted to make sure I did. My husband and I booked a room here just a few weeks before our stay in Dublin, so I was hoping we'd land at least somewhere passable, but boy did we luck out. The Wilder was so charming inside and out—cozy room (smallish, sure, but we're both around 6 feet and were perfectly comfortable), cute and quirky decor, beautiful architecture, tasty cocktails in a swanky lounge and lovely snacks to partake of. The location was perfect, too, just off a tree lined street a 10 minute walk from St. Stephen's Green. It was lovely to be walking distance to the city centre and still be somewhere quiet (other hotels had given me pause about city noise, but this location was great; save one rowdy stag party I overheard it was nice and calm). There's a bikeshare station right in front that we didn't get to use, sadly, but great to have there. The staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable and welcome (even giving us extra Nespresso pods the night before our early AM check-out and sharing copies of Oscar Wilde books when they made up the room). We will stay here again the next time we are in Dublin!",5,2019,06,11
214,Cosy townhouse,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at The Wilder.  We shared a ‘shoebox double’ as this was the only room available and I liked the look of The Wilder vs some of the other options with bigger rooms.

The room is tiny, but we knew that was going to be the case and once we’d worked
out where to put our stuff it actually worked well. The room is well appointed, the bathroom well designed and the bed is really comfy.  My only gripe was that there isn’t space to hang up 2 bath towels in the bathroom. Adding 1 additional hook could solve this issue, otherwise you constantly have 1 damp towel! 

The interior design is well thought through and makes the place feel like a home rather than a hotel.  It’s definitely got character and feels like a small boutique rather than a big commercial hotel. Location is fantastic - we walked everywhere and it was nice
to return to a slightly quieter neighbourhood after a long day exploring.
Communal areas are limited to a small restaurant and bar which were always quiet when we were there, despite the place being fully booked.  

There was a good selection at breakfast, although both my husband and I had avocado with poached eggs and the portion size was not generous - small slices of toast with barely any avocado.

The only other niggle was that the 2nd floor we stayed on had a strange smell - I’d
liken it to when your vacuum cleaner’s bag needs changing or the whole thing needs cleaning. This was a shame as it wasn’t the nicest smell to be hit with each morning when you opened your room door! 

Overall a good stay and I’d recommend it to others looking for somewhere with a bit of character. 
",4,2019,06,03
214,Absolutely tiny rooms but wonderful all the same,"My stay at the Wilder was terrific; I would absolutely return. 
It is a relatively new hotel, with very recently done renovations. My 'shoebox room' was indeed miniscule--just a few feet wider than the Queen sized bed.  For two people it might be too small--I'm not sure how both would maneuver around the bed at the same time--but as I was a solo traveler and I don't much care about the size of the room, it was perfect.  The room looked exactly as I expected from the website pictures (if smaller; the bed was incredibly comfortable (I slept so well even my first night); and the shower had terrific water pressure from the rain shower and nice, hot water.  The toilet and shower are separate, which might help a couple in the small space.  
The service at the hotel was excellent as well.  My room was ready early when I arrived after a flight from the US; and when I checked out and asked to leave my bags so that I could walk to get my rental car and come back to pick up my things, they were totally accommodating.  (There is an area outside making it easy to stop and load the car.)
The hotel location is terrific as well, in a quiet residential area just about a five minute walk from the southern side of St Stephen's Green.  Down the street in the other direction, less than a block, is the Grand Canal, which is a wonderful pedestrian walk.
There is also a restaurant on site but I didn't use it.",5,2019,05,28
214,nice stay,"We spent three nights in a popular double room.

Service:  The service was outstanding from start to finish. Wojciech and Snejana at reception were both extremely accommodating and helpful, as were Adrian, Lukas, and Rachael in the bar/restaurant. Thank you.

Location:  The Wilder is in a nice area accessible to restaurants and attractions. Bus 757 from the airport stops a short walk away. It is close to St. Stephen’s Green, where you can catch a hop on hop off bus convenient for exploring Dublin.

Room:  The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The nightly turn down service was a nice touch. The bathroom was good sized and well appointed. The room itself was small and a bit cramped for two people, so it might make sense to consider other rooms if you need space, particularly for a longer stay. Also, the room safe will hold an ipad but not a small laptop",4,2019,05,23
214,Wonderful Stay at The Wilder,"We had a gorgeous room with a bath, it’s own sitting area and a king size bed. The linens were luxurious, feather pillows, fluffy towels, quality toiletries, turn down service, tea and coffee making facilities in the room, mini bar, magazines and books to read. It was quiet even though it was full. Do not miss the breakfast. Fresh, delicious, hand made, excellent quality. I a lovely light filled room. All of the staff were attentive and friendly. Can’t wait to come back.",5,2019,05,23
214,"Great Hotel, very attentive staff",Brand new hotel that is gorgeous. Exceptional service from Adrian and Samantha who help with great food suggestion as well as helping me with a power adapter (given that my suitcase was misplaced by the airline),5,2019,05,21
214,Fab hotel in an excellent location ,"We booked 2 nights at the Wilder to kick off our mini-moon in Ireland and absolutely loved it. The hotel is gorgeous and location is great for an easy wander into town. It is expensive but you get what you pay for. Breakfast was also lovely, between us we sampled the full Irish, pancakes and salmon and all Were equally delicious. The staff are also fantastic. Cannot recommend enough if you are after a swanky place to stay whilst exploring what Dublin has to offer. ",5,2019,05,18
214,"Wonderful, even though we messed up our booking and the hotel was fully booked, the receptionist fixed everything. ","We had a fabulous stay at the Wilder, the hotel is gorgeous , the location perfect. You know you're in a great hotel when they make a huge effort to fix a problem you create when booking. The Wilder is a Class Act. ",5,2019,05,14
214,Fabulous hotel with great staff.,Booked this hotel as had business in the area and I was not disappointed.  The rooms were very comfortable and had all necessary amenities.  The small bar / restaurant area was perfect for a night cap to unwind after a busy day and the breakfast was amazing with a great choice.  Every staff member I met throughout my stay were so professional and friendly...I'm looking forward to my next trip to Dublin so i can experience the Wilder again.,5,2019,05,12
214,Luxury in the heart of Dublin,"Myself and my husband stayed here over the weekend and what a find!!  We booked based on other reviews and I must say it will be my first choice in the future.  Beautiful rooms, quirky decor, superb breakfast and so close to the centre without being caught in the hustle and bustle....  Will be visiting again soon...",5,2019,05,12
214,Very pleasant hotel with great staff,"Very comfortable room and bathroom was adequate in size. I don’t like showers over baths so I can’t give this a higher rating. Hotel is a newly renovated one, and about 25 minutes walk to tourist precinct, and doesn’t have many restaurants nearby. We found a reasonable “Irish pub” about 5 minutes walk away, The Barge, but it’s focus was more about sports than tradition. 
Continental Breakfast was quite good but the breakfast dining room was a bit squeezy 
We had the Miss Wade junior suite. Would stay there again.",4,2019,05,12
214,The Wilder the better,"My husband and I recently had our first night away without our baby and the luxury of The Wilder was the perfect place to do it. It’s a beautiful townhouse a stones throw from Stephens Green and Dublin’s main shopping streets. 

The hotel is a beautiful light filled Georgian Building that is stylishly finished. We stayed in the beautiful Lady Jane suite which I would happily live in!

The decor is sympathetic to the era of the building but still feels modern and chic. Period mahogany dressing table sits alongside a marble coffee table and Art Deco style velvet armchairs. I’ve taken inspiration for my own home. 

The staff are warm and friendly and very helpful. We had (a couple of) the gin of the week which was a delicious rhubarb infused gin. The residents bar has a lovely relaxed feel to it and doubles as the breakfast room during the day. However, it is cleverly styled so that you feel like you are in a trendy bar at night and a light soaked breakfast room during the day. 

The breakfast buffet catered for all tastes, with more choices available on a menu. I had smashed avocado on toast with poached eggs and my husband had the full Irish. I instantly had food envy, not least because the sausages and pudding were Clonakilty! 
My only criticism of the breakfast is that the bread selection was in another part of the dining room...making my walk of shame for extra bread longer. I had a cumin infused bread (it was like a corn bread...can’t remember the type of bread it was but it was tasty!). 

As I mentioned, the location is perfect, a short walk to Stephens Green and the city centre. You are also close to Ranelagh, a trendy suburb of Dublin with lots of cafes, restaurants and bars. Lots of parks and squares to wander around. 

I should be transparent and say I have a family connection to the hotel. However, this is a hotel I would definitely recommend to friends and family and hope to stay in again.",5,2019,05,10
214,excellent boutique,"High marks for the Wilder Townhouse. This is a well-run boutique on a quiet block 10 minutes walk to St. Stephens Green. Breakfasts are well prepared with continental and hot offerings. Staff is welcoming and attentive. Our room on the third floor was quiet and comfortable. No noise from other rooms, and no street noise even though we faced Adelaide Road. Note: it was early May, a bit chilly outside and the windows of our room were closed. Glad to have booked at this hotel. Would definitely return.",5,2019,05,07
214,Style and excellence ,"What a magical boutique hotel! The attention to detail, decor and warm professional welcoming staff throughout the hotel help make this a joyful experience.

It’s the small touches in all they do and how everything is presented that gives charm and a personality to the hotel.

A welcome addition to Dublin and very much in its spirit, we will definitely be back. ",5,2019,05,06
214,Elegance in Dublin,"Upon arrival in Dublin after an overnight flight from NY, we were able to check in early and get some sleep, which was very much appreciated.  We were given a random upgrade to a suite, which was incredible. The decor was elegant and luxurious. It was a bit of a walk to center city, but that was expected and done in 15 minutes. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Deserves a 10 rating. Reluctant to leave such lovely surroundings.",5,2019,04,29
214,Beautiful Townhouse in fantastic location,"Recently stayed in The Wilder Townhouse whilst on a business trip to Dublin. I was very pleasantly surprised by the stunning decor of the hotel and warm inviting reception area. The location is very central, only a few steps away from Leeson Street. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was exceptional, I think the decor of the dining area was my favourite. Will definitely be returning!",5,2019,04,23
214,Excellent Location! ,"The Wilder Townhouse is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location. I’m so delighted I found this place. It is only a few minutes walk into the city and to lots of lovely restaurants and cafes. The place itself is beautifully decorated. We stayed in room 101 which was not the shoebox room I had booked so it was a nice surprise! The room had a huge, very comfortable bed with plenty of storage space and the most beautiful bathroom. There was tea, coffee, cookies and water plus a mini bar. Even though the room was at the front of the hotel on the ground floor, it was really quiet. The staff were friendly and we had a drink in the bar. The Guinness was very good!! We didn’t have our car but there is parking which is brilliant for Dublin. I’m in no doubt that I’ll be returning to The Wilder again! ",5,2019,04,22
214,Good for a 1 or 2 night stay,"The Wilder is very new and very stylish. Rooms are smaller than average (and they have smaller ones than the one we booked), so might not suit you if you have a large suitcase. However, it is well located within a short walk to Stephen’s Green and on a Luas line. 
Bathroom doors - do not offer much privacy; Toilet bowl - smallest one I’ve ever seen. 
Air con heating - we turned it off when going to bed, but it was on when we woke?!
Room too small for a wardrobe;
Breakfast - beautiful room & delicious; only vegan dish is Porridge made with almond milk; everything else has eggs; 
Free coffee at the bar;
Housekeeping rapped the door at 11.58 & 12.08! Staff at Reception were professional, though not very warm and didn’t ask if we’d enjoyed our stay;
Irish Times - not available at weekends?!
We took the Roly’s package which was good value and allowed us choose anything on the a la carte, plus a bottle of house wine; food is good, though choice is not adventurous;",3,2019,04,07
214,Chic and lovely,"Very comfortable room nicely decorated, a beautiful bathroom with a huge bath. The breakfast is served in a lovely room, we chose the continental breakfast (15€), very good, nice croissant, fruits, granola. You can order special dishes for 5€ more. ",4,2019,03,23
214,Really Beautiful - 5 star,"Was so surprised to find this gem of a hotel/townhouse in central Dublin. Design detail sublime, bed so comfy... breakfast (eggs benedict) one of the best. Well priced.
The staff are incredibly warm and friendly. I WILL BE BACK!",5,2019,03,12
214,Flying Visit,"Second time staying,Great experience again, quirky interiors, fabulous food,and very welcoming staff! A home away from home😁 will be recommending to friends and family and can't wait to come back again soon thanks",5,2019,03,11
214,Hidden Gem in Dublin,A hidden gem in Dublin. Excellent location and fabulous place to stay. Everyone is so friendly and helpful making you feel at home as soon as you walk in the door. Breakfast is wonderful served in a lovely location and they have a pretty mean selection of gins. ,5,2019,03,03
214,Boutique,A very stylish hotel in a great quiet location. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful. Our bathroom and shower was a little on the small side but we had a great stay.,4,2019,02,12
214,My favourite hotel in Dublin,I've stayed at the Wilder twice now and just love this hotel. It's small and beautifully decorated. I spend half my time their Instragram-ing pics of the decor. The staff are always really friendly and helpful.  The rooms are large with really comfortable beds. I always sleep really well here. There's a lovely feel to the place and the price is really reasonable.  They serve a fabulous breakfast but otherwise only serve light bites in the bar for the rest of the day.,5,2019,02,06
214,The perfect hotel,"Beautiful hotel with very friendly staff. I stayed here for two nights for my wedding and Brian, Brid and the team were fantastic and accomodating in every way. Couldn't recommend it more. Can't wait to go back and stay again.",5,2019,01,13
214,Beautiful hotel,"Loved this place with fabulous decor and excellent rooms, staff were friendly and efficient. I highly recommend this if you’re spending some time in Dublin, conveniently located just a short from the city centre.",5,2018,12,31
214,Perfect Dublin Hotel,"Last minute we adjusted our Europe plans and had an overnight in Dublin before returning to Seattle. Being almost Christmas, a lot of places were already fully booked and the closest we could get to the city centre was The Wilder.

Well ...  what a great find! 

We were able to park our rental out the front on the gravel which was nice and easy and the hotel itself had the 'just new' feeling, hardly surprising given how new it is. Very welcoming front desk staff and indeed throughout our short stay we found everyone super friendly and helpful.

The location was great, a short stroll to St Stephen's Green and then the main shopping district.

The room (303) was a little small (bit of a squeeze getting past the end of the bed) but the large bathroom and great shower made up for that. The pillows were fab and the bed was very comfy, so pretty much what you need in a hotel room! The windows isolated any exterior noise well, almost too well as the noisiest thing in the room turned out to be the fridge - but that was soon turned off and all was silent once more.

The star of the party was the breakfast though. Wonderful buffet style continental (plus a hot menu if desired) contained a wealth of fruits, grains, breads, pastries and so forth. The fruit smoothie plus fresh fruit over granola was wonderful and the breakfast room looks as if it would be even more amazing when the weather is warm enough to allow it to open onto the patio.

Would absolutely seek out this place to stay again when next in Dublin - loved it all round.",5,2018,12,23
214,Noisy unswitch-offable air con,"A lot of the little issues at this lovely stylish place would be resolved if someone in charge mystery shopped a visit there themselves to check out the experience and make sure things were as they should be. 

The main thing though is a terrible heating/cooling system. Ours could not be switched off or adjusted, even by the lovely guy at the main desk (at midnight, after a very pleasant evening out - not ideal) and it was noisy and blowy and therefore it was difficult to sleep. I don't know why aircon is necessary in a small room in Ireland in Winter or at all - it's an awful American penchant - radiators and windows are fine.  

The hotel was not full when we stayed in mid week November but nonetheless we were placed in a room right beside the noisy main road with some works going on outside.  

The room was tiny but lovely and very comfortable with big towels and a very comfortable bed and great bedding.  No bath, just shower. Maison Margiela toiletries, but in a really odd scent that smelt of tobacco. 

The place is attentively done up and looks great, and spotless.

We had a drink in the bar on our way out to eat and we moved from our cosy lounge seats to get away from the blasting cold air conditioning (again, on a cold rainy night in November - why, why?). We sat by the bar counter instead, where the kitchen door was open and a glasswasher or something was roaring away.  The bar lady was lovely and the bar is a very pleasant space, but there were no cocktails available. 

We had arrived a little early (after 1pm) and asked if we could park our car in the almost empty car park until check in time and the receptionist hesitantly agreed. Was this really a big ask? 

I can't recall exactly how much our room cost but it was very reasonably priced against other nearby hotels on that night and it's a friendly place and of course the location is great.",3,2018,12,17
214,Quaint and Stylish,"This property is a heritage listed building that has a rich history.  It has been beautifully renovated but maintains the charm and character of the property in both the public areas and the rooms.  The rooms themselves are small, with a distinct lack of storage and hanging space so maybe not ideal for a longer stay, but everything is new and the bed was plenty big enough for me and certainly comfortable.  My main complaint would be the set-up of the bathroom with a shelf right above the basin make washing ones face and shaving somewhat awkward but the separate shower works well, the WiFi was good and aside from that minor gripe it is a lovely and unique property.  The staff were extremely friendly in that lovely Irish way and most helpful.  We walked into Grafton St and the center of Dublin in around 10 minutes but the area around the hotel feels quite residential so it is nicely located.  Highly recommended if you like something a bit different from the bog-standard cookie-cutter hotel chains.  I would certainly go back there.",4,2018,12,16
214,Absolutely adorable hotel in Dublin,"I stayed here for a few nights in September with a friend of mine. After conducting research online, asking around and comparing prices, the Wilder had everything we were looking for and the price was right! Much more affordable than most other hotels in Dublin. The Wilder has recently been renovated. All furnishings and finishes are brand new and beautiful. The charm of this little hotel is unmatched and magazine worthy. Service was warm and friendly. There is no restaurant onsite other than a quaint cafe with tea, coffee etc. so prepare to venture elsewhere for your meals. Overall, I had a good experience staying here and would come back in a heartbeat. Enjoy your stay at the Wilder!",4,2018,12,15
214,Charming and Cozy,"Great little hotel.  The standard double rooms are quite ""cozy"" (small), but what the hotel lacks in space it makes up for in charming decor and attentive staff. The location is not absolutely central but you can be in the heart of downtown in less than a 10-minute walk.",5,2018,11,29
214,Stylish Hotel in a Super Location,"This is a small boutique hotel that is within walking distance of the NCH, Grafton Street, The Aviva and the RDS; however, Adelaide Road is a quiet enough road at the weekend. 
The hotel itself is very nice and stylish. Lots of lovely little details in the room. We did not eat here so I can't speak to that but I would imagine it would be good.",4,2018,11,26
214,Charming,Brand new boutique hotel.  Very charming & well appointed.  A bit of a walk from everything but doable.  The gravel in the parking area in front of the building makes it awkward to roll your luggage - they should have a walking path.   Bathrooms are cute but small which is expected from a charming old building.  Over all it was a good stay.,4,2018,11,06
214,Perfect location and comfortable hotel,"I think I couldn’t have found a better hotel for my stay in Dublin, 10 minutes of walk to go to the city center main streets and monuments, yet located in a more quiet area. Very close to beautiful St. Stephen’s Park. From the other reviews I have read it is preferable not to have a room overlooking Adélaide Road which is the noisiest around the hotel. My room was on the other side as I requested it in advance and was very comfortable (comfy bed, nice big bathroom with good warer stream for head shower and detachable shower). Staff were excellent, very pleasant and helpful. Not too big hotel which I really appreciate. The only thing I disliked was the home perfume that had been sprayed in the room, I don’t like these chemical smells but as soon as I told the reception that I didn’t like it they informed the housekeeping service not to use it again in my room and they did not forget. :-) I recommand this hotel.",4,2018,11,06
214,Attentive staff and blissful comfort,"Travelling for work usually involves soleless hotels which look the same in every country. Staying at the Wilder was an unexpected treat. The manager Brid was so warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble (does she ever sleep?). There was a problem with the guiness on the night we were there but there was no drama and we actually really enjoyed the recommended pub before returning to sample Martha's Revenge, a delicious whey gin. The breakfast laid out was a piece of art and the whole room looked so pretty. I wish I had had time to enjoy what was on the menu but that is something I will have to return for. The lovely lady who attended to us could not have been more charming and friendly. 
My room was a haven of neutral colours with a squishy carpet, really comfortable bed (I slept so soundly which is unusual for me on 1st night in an hotel), plenty of sockets for charging tech, a nespresso machine with my favourite coffee pod, quirky furnishing, and lovely bathroom with great amenities. 
I only wish I could have stayed longer as I know I would have returned home even more rested in contrast to the usual stressed out feeling following a working weekend. 
So great hotel, great food but the staff were the true highlight! Can't wait to return.",5,2018,11,04
214,Fantastic!!,"My husband and I spent a night here recently - fantastic hotel in every way. The staff are brilliant, attentive without being overly so. The hotel itself is beautiful - our room was small but cosy and comfortable. We didn’t have breakfast in the hotel but there are lots of very good options nearby.  I would 100% recommend this hotel - you won’t regret it!!",5,2018,10,31
214,A Hotel That Is Itself - As Oscar Wilde Would Like It,"Oscar Wilde said, “Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”, and this townhouse hotel is true to his saying - it's unique and special. It's unlike anything else in Dublin, at least. And that's good!

This is a superb townhouse-style multis-story boutique hotel located on Harcourt Terrace, Adelaide Road Dublin, close to the Grand Canal, Portobello and the finest of Georgian Dublin. It is modern, quirky, well-designed and decorated and fun too. Bedrooms are clean, tastefully decorated a la Wilde, equipped with the last modcons (inc Nespresso machine), enough power outlets for the business traveller, and free, fast Wifi (throughout the hotel), Bathrooms are spotless and there is the usual high level of attention to service of the rooms through the day and night.
The bar ""The High Spirts"" is small, but cosy and well stocked with a food menu of  :Ight Bites (cheese, charcuterie, smoked salmon, soup, sandwiches"". Service is fast and friendly. The main dining area for breakfast is drawing-room style, well laid out, comfortable and with a range of fare to suit all - from the healthy fresh fruit and yoghurt to the more decadent sweet treats.
Reception area is neat and checkin is also fast, pleasant, and  staff very helpful and engaging. 
In all, this is a great accommodation option for the business traveller or for anyone visiting Dublin to see the sights or some special event. This is parking available, but the hotel is close to the LUAS line so most of the rest of the city can be accessed easily.
A great find - The Wilder is somewhere we will be hearing a lot more about!",5,2018,10,27
214,"Friendly, clean, and quiet ","The staff is wonderful. Friendly and helpful! From the moment we walked in the door everyone on staff was kind and happy. Our room was elegant and clean. The bathroom was spacious and well lit. 
As for the location, we liked it not being so close to the Temple Bar area of Dublin, but it was within walking distance to many of the tourists hit spots. Cabs drive by it frequently as well if needed. 
Highly recommend this place!",5,2018,10,21
214,Amazing in every way,"What a beautiful hotel. It is the perfect mix of opulence and coziness. The rooms are stunning, the bathrooms and toiletries really luxurious. We had an incredible breakfast and gorgeous cocktails. The staff were superb - friendly and super helpful in every way. The location is spot on - really close to the hub of everything but wonderfully quiet. Couldn’t recommend it highly enough and we can’t wait to come back. Thanks to all at The Wilder for giving us such a lovely stay xxx",5,2018,10,21
214,Great stay in the heart of Dublin,"Beautiful new hotel in the heart of Dublin. Converted old townhouse with friendly staff, bar, and nicely appointed rooms. Comfortable beds, nice bathrooms and great amenities. Rooms have an abundance of character, close to bus stops and transit, walkable to St. Stephens green and other sites.",5,2018,10,14
214,Very Tasteful,An ideal location for me as it is virtually next door to our office. Very tastefully appointed. Nice residents bar.  Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was delicious. Very quiet in the evenings in the immediate area but plenty of amenities only a short walk away.,4,2018,10,11
214,Tragically disorganized,"Let me start by saying that I think all the staff here are nice people doing their best.

Unfortunately, and this is likely down to the management, it was nearly impossible to get the most routine, simple requests accomplished.

The heat went on in my room every couple of hours, despite my turning the air conditioning on. They tried to best to fix this, but it was never resolved.

They couldn't seem to manage something as simple as adjusting my bill when we'd been told that we would not be charged for breakfast as we'd told the manager the night before that we wouldn't be having breakfast.

I left something in my room and after emailing them in a matter of hours they haven't been able to respond after two days.

It's a shame because the building is nice and as I say the people are doing their best. Maybe they will get new or better management and the place can rise to its potential.",1,2018,10,05
214,What an absolute find....!,"What an absolutely wonderful little find!
It is so beautifully located in a quiet leafy street and yet in 5 minutes we are on St Stephens Green.  The rooms are fantastically quirky with gorgeous little unique touches that you don't normally see in hotel bedrooms.  The breakfast buffet choice & menu was really fantastic and the whole experience was just an absolute pleasure!
We loved everything about The Wilder and thoroughly enjoyed our stay, we will definitely be back.",5,2018,10,01
214,Blown away by Dublin’s newest hotspot ,"My friends and I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Wilder hotel, just off Stephen’s Green- We’d heard of the elegant new hotel, with a unique history and said we’d have to give it a try, safe to say we were not disappointed!! On arrival we were greeted by 2 friendly receptionists who made us feel instantly welcome, showing an interest in our stay to Dublin, while also giving helpful recommendations and tips for our stay in the Capital. Our rooms were nothing short of 5 star- the interior was very classy with beautiful artwork decorating the walls and our king size bed facilitated an extremely comfortable sleep.
We were disappointed to not have had time to experience the Gin bar as the menu looked very well thought out but were redeemed by our dining experience at breakfast- the continental buffet had a great selection of fresh fruit, yoghurts and pastries which were perfect to nibble on before our main breakfast which was selected from a delicious menu with a variety of different options from overnight oats to eggs benedict- very modern inclusion of dietary requirements which was very helpful for our party of 4! We were sad to be checking out, wishing we had another night in this fantastic new hotel which accommodated such a great night in Dublin ",5,2018,09,29
214,LOVED IT,"Great location, beautiful hotel. Felt safe, comfortable and oh so stylish. Great facilities, walking distance to the city centre and everything we needed, or there is a tram stop right there! Even includes free parking!",5,2018,09,23
214,Little Gem,"Stayed here for 1 night, beautiful boutique hotel great location to Grafton street etc. Staff very nice and helpful, the room was a bit small but for 1 or 2 nights it was perfect. 
Def recommend it to my friends and family.",4,2018,09,17
214,A hidden gem in the midst of Dublin!,"This hotel is a well kept secret. If you want to enjoy the amenities of a gracious, well appointed hotel, this is the one for you!
The front desk could not be more helpful and the room is lovely! Great detail has been put into the restoration of this property.
Highly recommended!",5,2018,09,10
214,New Gem in Dublin,"The Wilder, if not already, will be the ""go to"" hotel in Dublin.  Great spacious rooms with superior bathrooms.  Super bar with everything that you would want.  The breakfast was outstanding with the freshest fruits and tastiest pastries.  Only a month or so old when we were there - already showing incredible promise to be the top hotel in Dublin.  Highly recommend!!",5,2018,09,08
214,Very nice hotel!,"We stayed for 3 nights on Aug, 2018. The hotel is brand new, and is very beautiful. The decoration is elegant and welcoming, and the staff is friendly and always taking care of you. Our room was nice and cozy, the bathroom was big enough and comfortable. Great bed, also. The location was great for us, 15 min. walk to the city centre. Parking is available, which is very useful. The hotel is located on a beautiful street near the river. Being a guest here made us feel very welcome, on a beautiful place, and we could rest, since we were coming from a long trip. We highly recommend it! Thank you very much, The Wilder Hotel!!",5,2018,09,08
214,"You get what you pay for - location excellent, room quite small","I’ve been to Dublin 20+ times and have stayed in a range of hotels from great (Merrion, Westbury) to awful (Central Hotel). Decided to try this new hotel (open about a month) as it was about half the cost of the Westbury. 
The location is excellent and the public space (bar and tea room) is very nice. My room, 306 is very small.  A look at the room map on the back of the door indicates that this is the size of the vast majority of the rooms. I’ve attached a couple of photos. You would like a room with a desk and a closet? No, you get a small vanity that barely holds a laptop and a clothing bar to hang your clothes.  There are no drawers to place your clothes, so you have no choice but to live from your suitcase. And the bed, while comfortable, is tucked into a space with perhaps 18 inches of space to the wall on either side.  The bathroom is spacious by comparison. The shower has an overhead rain shower along with a handheld.  The handheld has exceptional pressure, nearly enough to take paint off of a car, so be careful!  
",4,2018,09,08
214,"Beautiful hotel, great location","Recently stayed in this beautiful hotel for one night. We were greeted by friendly reception staff and check in was quick and easy. The rooms have a lovely style with a little quirky touch here and there. The location is ideal for exploring the city, close to shopping, restaurant, bars and transport. Breakfast the next morning was excellent - lots of choice from the buffet and even more delicious options on the menu. Looking forward to my next stay already.",5,2018,09,07
214,Lovely new hotel quiet area,"Stayed here for 1 night recently - really lovely. It was only opened 5 weeks ago which is impressive. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Bedroom was very nice.... a few points though... 
Our room (32 I think it was on the 4th floor right at the end) - really nice but only thing to say was the noise... we were only staying one night and I didn't notice it until we were trying to sleep and had turned off the telly - but there was a very loud humming noise which I thought was the aircon, turned it off but was still there - I am a good sleeper but still could hear it and vibrated my pillow - not sure if there was the main aircon facility right above our heads in the roof - or some sort of generator somewhere but was quite an issue... I would have asked to be moved but was very late and we are VERY tired after a wedding so I put in ear plugs.
Another thing which would be great is if the hotel could look into is the amount of single use plastic that is on offer - I would have hoped that a brand new boutique hotel might like to take a lead on keeping this to a minimum - LOTS of product in bathroom - not sure why there can't be a refillable nice brand (I know people like to take the shampoos etc away but still)... also, plastic branded water bottles... if only there were glass! 
The bed was super comfy and linen was soft. Really nice touch the shortbread biscuits in the room and the complimentary tea and coffee downstairs (oh, we could not work out how to use the coffee machine in the room - again, those little plastic coffee pods are not the best for the environment).
Bathroom was lovely - really nice towels. No extractor though so the bathroom was very steamy and the mirror steamed up for a long time too. 
I would totally stay here again though and wish we had known about it for the first part of our stay when we had booked somewhere else. 
",4,2018,09,07
214,Fabulous Boutique Hotel ,"Absolute fantastic hotel, from the moment we checked in to checking out every thing was top notch. Receptionist was very friendly and made us feel very welcoming. Since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary got a lovely upgrade to a fabulous room greeted with lovely treats. I would highly recommend this hotel.

 Fabulous breakfast with large choice, all cooked fresh, simply delicious. ",5,2018,09,02
214,Weekend holiday,"I love this Hotel. Friendly personell, Nice clean room. Walk distance to the bar and shopping district. I will highly recommend this place. You have everything you need. New and modern with familiar style. ",5,2018,09,02
214,Loved it,"I stayed in the Wilder a few weeks ago.  It's central location suited me perfectly as I had business nearby the next day.  I was hugely impressed by this property and they have really nailed that London Townhouse Boutique Hotel style matching modern comforts with the style of the listed building.

The room was beautifully finished with great style, the breakfast was the best I have had in a hotel and the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help.

I don't normally give reviews but had to for the Wilder.  I'll be back.",5,2018,08,30
214,"Luxurious & Quaint Boutique Hotel, Fantastic Location","I had the absolute pleasure of staying in this gorgeous boutique hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend for our anniversary. From our initial arrival to final check-out, we could not have wanted for anything more. We had a truly memorable few days at The Wilder and a huge thank you to all the staff who went above and beyond to look after us. I absolutely recommend this hotel, you won't be disappointed. 

The reception staff, the restaurant staff and the porters were super efficient, friendly, and went above and beyond our expectations. Rachel and Laura in the restaurant were so lovely and welcomed us with a big smile and coffee every morning! They were highly professional and very charming, we loved chatting with them during our stay. They really added to our overall experience. I am from Dublin myself (my boyfriend is Italian) and I honestly felt like I was on holidays abroad.

The homemade spread of buffet was delicious and they had such a great selection to cater to everyone's taste. We also ordered off the breakfast menu and the food arrived super fast and it was just yummy! The tables were set up with the most beautiful crockery and cutlery and the dining room itself is just gorgeous in its design. Unfortunately due to the weather we did not get to avail of the ""al fresco"" dining area, but the beautiful breakfast space inside really made up for that.

The Hotel Manager Brid was absolutely delightful during our encounters with her. She was extremely professional and helpful. She was also an absolute pleasure to deal with. I cannot thank her enough or speak more highly of her charming personality and professionalism. A lovely team, thank you all for making our stay so memorable. Five star staff without a doubt, what about the hotel itself?

Our suite was bright, spacious, well-thought out, just gorgeous! Everything from the wallpaper to the luxury Replica bathroom products, we were delighted with the room. 
We opened the bedroom door into a cosy lounge area with chairs, lounger and table. Off to the side we had a large desk and mirror - a huge space for me to get ready and do my makeup!! Behind the partition wall was the bedroom and ensuite bathroom. We just loved the elegant design and decor that made us feel right at home. 

We had 2 televisions in the room and 5 windows!! The rainfall shower was so relaxing and the water was perfect temperature every time I used it, without fussing over the hot and cold taps - they have seriously thought of everything in this hotel, their passion and dedication to the ultimate customer experience is apparent from the minute you enter the hotel grounds. 

Five stars, strongly recommended, cannot wait to be back soon.",5,2018,08,28
214,Wow Wow Wow,"I stayed in The Wilder with my daughter at the weekend and can’t recommend this stunning hotel highly enough. The reception staff were so welcoming,  pleasant and check in was effortless. Our bedroom was beautifully appointed and decorated with unique & quirky design features that you’ll find throughout the building. The bathroom was lovely and the replica products a real treat.  We were lucky enough to sit out on the terrace with a yummy cocktail from a v appealing drinks menu. The bar man was so friendly, helpful and knowledgable. Our drinks were served with homemade cookies much to my daughters delight. The blankets discreetly dotted around were a lovely touch to keep you warm 💕.  The breakfast was a real treat with an extensive range and all very tasty and beautifully presented.  Our waitress was v attentive.  
So overall a really wonderful Experiance from check in to check out. It is a quirky and unique boutique hotel with really beautiful decor and staff. The location is exceptional less than 10 mins from St Stephen’s Green and so many amenities on your door step yet located in a very quiet and beautiful road.  
It has all the warmth and charm of Irish hospitality yet it wouldn’t be out of place in  London. Safe to stay, we will be back. Looking forward to it already 💕.",5,2018,08,20
214,Quaint & Beautiful Boutique Hotel by St. Stephen's Green,"I absolutely LOVED this new property in Dublin. I was a little skeptical booking since it's brand new (just opened this month) and there weren't a lot of reviews, but I was blown away by how lovely it was. We spent the night before at the Conrad Dublin and had a poor experience so it was nice to walk down the street to The Wilder and have a totally different experience.

The rooms are tiny, but perfect if you're out and about most of the day. Loved the Replica bath products too. They have the cutest bar and restaurant with a delicious breakfast (everything is craft and homemade). The bar is only open to residents of The Wilder and I had the best chamomile tea cocktail!

Overall loved everything about this property and would stay again if I return to Dublin in the future. Definitely worth booking just for the location and the amazing bar.",5,2018,08,14
214,Really lovely townhouse hotel in a fantastic location near city center,We stayed for one night and the hotel was great. You are only a 5 minute walk from St Stephen's Green. The price was reasonable for Dublin in peak season and the double room was very clean. The staff were also very accommodating regarding parking our car on the grounds before check in and after check out. Will definitely return.,5,2018,08,14
214,A lovely one night stay in Dublin,"The Wilder Hotel is in an excellent location on Adelaide Road on the corner of Harcourt Terrace (Google Maps doesn’t actually point to the right location).  We arrived at about 1pm last Friday and we got one of the scarce parking spots which was excellent.  The receptionist was very pleasant and booked us in without fuss. Our room wasn’t ready (we didn’t expect it to be ready) and we headed off to the Horse Show (25 minute walk).
We got back at about 9.30pm, and got our room (103).  It was beautifully decorated, a lovely room if a little small.  The air conditioner was great and the ensuite was excellent with a brilliant shower. Coffee machine was great 
The staff were excellent throughout and the barman was very friendly and chatty.
All in all, a lovely stay",4,2018,08,12
214,Lovely hotel/residence just 15 minute walk from Dublin City Center,"This is a beautiful building, recently updated with lovely rooms, a bar, gorgeous breakfast/sitting room and delicious breakfasts. There is also a very pleasant patio right outside.
My room was small, but so well and beautifully remodeled taking advantage of the existing architectural details, such as leaving the forged fireplace and mantel as a frame for the bathroom sink, and the flooring tiles are gorgeous. There was every amenity and a fabulously comfortable bed. The ceilings are so high, perhaps that's why my room didn't feel small at all.
Breakfast was varied and delicious.",5,2018,08,09
214,"Very nice, new, boutique hotel","Stayed over in Dublin for work. This being high tourist season, usual decent hotels were quite pricey. My assistant found The Wilder at a great rate, and literally right around the corner from the client. A very nice hotel, in a great location (Adelaide Road, so City Centre but not the really busy, touristy part, yet an easy walk to anything in Dublin City Centre). The room was small, but most importantly the hotel called it a small room, so I knew what to expect, and was also well fit out, highly functional, and most of all comfortable - I didn't feel crowded. The high ceilings of the room certainly in this regard. The entire hotel is well appointed and comfortable. Given the rate I paid, the what I think are the exorbitant prices of other nice hotels in Dublin, and the location, an excellent addition to the Dublin hotel scene, and well worth it. Highly recommended.",5,2018,08,08
214,Highly Recommended ,We stayed here at the weekend and we were very impressed. The interior of the building was simply stunning. The room was very well laid out and great attention to detail was given to everything. The breakfast was amazing and there was plenty of choice available. The staff were very friendly and excellent customer service. Location is ideal. ,5,2018,07,31
214,Cute boutique hotel ,"My friend and I stayed at the wilder last night. It is a very cute hotel with an interesting history. The staff were super nice and the public spaces are pretty. Our room was charming and comfortable. The bathroom was really lovely. There were a few maintenance issues but the building is still a little under construction so I assume all those will be fixed in time. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. ",5,2018,07,11
214,Great Location. Charming Property,"New townhouse accommodation in the leafy Adelaide road suburb & just next to the Grand Canal. Ideal for the discerning traveller looking for quiet comfort & great location ( bike rental just outside on Harcourt Terrace or just 10 min walk to St. Stephen's Green/Grafton St shopping areas.
Exceptionally well appointed bedrooms are luxurious & very comfortable. We had a great sleep. Great shower too. 
Nice terrace area for continental breakfast.
Highly recommended!",5,2018,07,08
214,Stylish hotel in a central location,"We felt really comfortable here. We stayed at The Wilder as part of an Ireland round trip to the end. 
We had a lot of luggage with us, so it was very tight. The bathroom was big though.  A refrigerator is provided.
With luggage as part of a round trip it is not really practical, the hotel was booked by the operator.
For a short city trip with less luggage it is really recommended. 
The city is within walking distance in a short time.
The staff were all very friendly, very helpful and very attentive.
Breakfast was very good and fresh.
The interior is very stylish. 
The place is really recommended.",5,2024,09,11
214,Very expensive for the room enjoyed,"The 3 out of 5 painting is for the following: the room was literally a julo, you could barely move one by it and the small bed for two. Plus it only had a small window. All this in a room of almost 300 euros a night.

Otherwise, quiet, personalized quality breakfast, and very nice and willing staff.",3,2024,08,31
214,A dream,"We had a wonderful stay in this truly wonderful elegant and refined hotel, we had a wonderful time! It's a place that makes you feel at home. Thanks above all to the special assistance of Danny in particular who is the vice manager and Oscar who is the front desk manager! They assisted us in every way, we felt super pampered and they made our stay even more special! Thank you!!!",5,2024,03,02
214,Sehr empfehlenswertes Boutiquehotel in Dublin,Ein sehr stilvolles Boutique Hotel. Zentral zur Innenstadt und doch ruhig gelegen. Wir hatten ein sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtetes Zimmer.

214,Perfektes Stadthotel,"Wunderschönes Stadthotel! Gute Lage, schönes Zimmer mit tollem Badezimmer. Sehr freundlicher und aufmerksamer Service, Frühstück frisch und sehr lecker! Sehr empfehlenswert für einen Städtetrip nach Dublin!",5,2023,06,19
214,Klein und charmant,"Sehr schönes ruhig, aber doch zentral gelegenes Hotel. Sehr schöne Zimmer, tolle Bäder und ein fantastisches Frühstück. Das Personal ist extrem nett und zuvorkommend. Wir waren 4 Tage dort und können das Haus uneingeschränkt empfehlen.",5,2023,06,13
214,Posto magnifico vicino al cuore di Dublino,Boutique hotel vicinissimo al centro di Dublino. Personale gentilissimo e disponibile. La sala per le colazioni è ben arredata e soleggiata. Le camere sono ben rifinite e con stile. Nulla da eccepire. Non servono i mezzi pubblici. In 15’ si è nel centro città.,5,2022,04,20
214,Eccezionale!,"In posizione comoda al centro, la struttura è ospitata in un caratteristico palazzo d'epoca, con interni molto curati che coniugano la tipicità di ambienti originali con la modernità degli spazi comuni. Le camere sono spaziose e molto pulite, così come gli ambienti comuni, lo staff è disponibile. Appena arrivati ci è stato offerto un té nella sala bar, in un'atmosfera indimenticabile, quasi di altri tempi. La colazione è varia, con un'ottima offerta di piatti caldi preparati al momento. Consiglio a tutti questa guest house!",5,2021,11,03
214,"Schönes Hotel, gute gelegen, gute Bar","Ein sehr schön eingerichtetes Hotel, freundlicher Service, tolles Frühstück, gute Drinks an der Bar, angenehme Nachbarschaft und vielleicht 10 min zu Fuß ins Zentrum. Wir hatten zunächst ein Zimmer mit einer saulauten Klimaanlage vor dem Fenster, konnten dann aber tauschen. AUs diesem Grund, und weil mir vielleicht ein winziges bisschen Herzlichkeit zum Perfekten fehlte, gibt es 4 statt 5 Sterne.",4,2020,05,03
214,Hervorragend und empfehleswert!,"Ein wunderschönes, gepflegtes Townhouse Hotel in sehr guter Lage zur City. Selbst der kleine hintere Garten ist liebevoll gestaltet. Der Hotelservice ist sehr zuvorkommend und überaus liebenswürdig. Das Frühstück ist ausreichend und wird geschmackvoll serviert. Kurzum ein Boutique-Hotel zum Wohlfühlen und genießen.",5,2019,10,08
214,Super schön,"Tolles Hotel in super Citylage!
Wunderschöne Einrichtung, kleine aber liebevoll eingerichtete Zimmer.
Super Frühstück, sehr nette Mitarbeiter.
Wir waren mit 7 Personen im Juni da es war einfach toll.
Gerne kommen wir wieder und empfehlen weiter.",5,2019,07,24
214,Una breve vacanza a Dublino,"The Wilder è semplicemente stupendo!
Appena si entra nel cortiletto si ha già subito la sensazione di essere a casa propria.
Personale dell'hotel gentilissimo, camera e struttura curate in ogni minimo dettaglio. 
Non c'è nulla che non sia perfetto.",5,2019,07,21
214,Wunderbarer Aufenthalt,"Hervorragendes, neu renoviertes Hotel in der Nähe des Canals. Perfekter, höflicher und zuvorkommender Service. Sehr liebe- und stilvoll eingerichtete Zimmer. Frühstück top. 20min zu Fuß bis zur Liffey. Toller Aufenthalt. Immer wieder.",5,2019,06,23
214,Bellissimo,"Partendo dalla posizione, sicuramente una posizione davvero buona, fermata dei bus a 5 minuti a piedi, da questa fermata passa anche il bus che ti porta all'aeroporto, ma se si ha voglia di camminare, si può benissimo evitare e godersi le bellezze di Dublino a piedi, in 20 minuti si arriva al trinity college, oppure alla famosa statua di molly malone, a 2 km si trova la famosa O’Connell street, strada ricca di pub e locali multietnici dove poter mangiare o gustare una bella birra, oltre a essere una strada ricca di persone, soprattutto nel weekend. La nostra stanza era pulita e soprattutto bellissima, il prezzo non è basso ma in media i prezzi degli hotel a Dublino non lo sono. Anche la struttura nella sua totalità era nuova e ben tenuta, con staff gentile e efficiente.",5,2019,06,07
214,stilvoll & ruhig ,"Tolles Boutique-Hotel, liebevoll gestaltet in zentraler (und trotzdem ruhiger) Lage. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Zimmer sind relativ klein, aber für einen Städtetrip auf jeden Fall ausreichen.",5,2019,05,29
214,Geheimtipp in Dublin....Psssst...nicht weitersagen!,"Wir wohnten in einem normalen Zimmer. Wir ließen uns aber noch während unseres Aufenthaltes die Suiten ( Lady Audley und Lady Jane) zeigen: Die Lady Jane Suite ist der Hammer! Sehr hübsch und durch eine Kaminanimation sehr wohnlich. Und das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis stimmt garantiert! In unseren Augen günstig für Dublin. Das Hotel liegt in einer guten und soliden Wohngegend. Diese Jahr neu eröffnetes Hotel in einem hübsch renovierten alten Gemäuer! Wunderbare Atmosphäre, leicht familiär, pittoresk, mit dem Gefühl, nicht in einem Hotel zu sein, eher bei einer Familie. Es ist sehr wohnlich. Man erkennt spanische Einflüsse durch den Architekten. Die Liebe zum Detail ist überall zu finden. Alles ist äußerst geschmackvoll gelungen. Es ist eine sehr ansprechende Unterkunft. Etwas nachteilig empfanden wir, dass es keinen Kleiderschrank gab und die Fenster nicht wirklich schalldicht sind, da sie stilecht übernommen wurden.... Das Frühstücksbuffet ist wunderbar sortiert mit vielen frischen Früchten, Yoghurt etc....und guten Kaffee! Die Hotelbar läd zu einem Gute-Nacht-Getränk ein (der Gin Fizz ist besonders gut!). Das Personal ist durch seine Jugendlichkeit herrlich erfrischend, die Managerin und Damen der Rezeption sehr nett und aufmerksam. Die Innenstadt, Temple Bar und Camden sind eigentlich fußläufig gut erreichbar, aber um die Ecke befindet sich auch eine S-Bahn Haltestelle. Fazit: Wir kommen wieder! Und nächstes Mal buchen wir die Lady Jane Suite...",5,2018,11,02
