The hotel is absolutely gorgeous—stylish rooms with either breathtaking city or Mediterranean views. The decor is top-notch, blending classic and modern vibes perfectly.

The highlight for us was definitely the rooftop area. The views from the restaurant are unbeatable, and the infinity pool is the perfect spot to chill out after a day of exploring. We had some delicious meals up there too!

The staff were super friendly and always ready to help with anything we needed. They made our stay extra special with their attentive service.

If you’re heading to Barcelona and want a place that’s luxurious, comfortable, and has amazing views, Serras Barcelona is the place to be. Highly recommend it!",5,2024,09,10

18,Best hotel in Bcn!,"We stayed two nights and it was magnificent. The personnel, the food at the restaurant, the treatment received, and the feeling of comfort in the middle of the city made. once we arrived the concierge recommended us some restaurants and made some reservations for us. Yet we decided to have dinner at the restaurant and cancel one of our reservations, what a great decision it was! The food was exquisite. MUST go for the patatas bravas. Afterwards, we decided to spend the rest of the night at the rooftop bar with the views of the entire marina. Rooms are great, comfortable and practical. They even give you a phone so that to can communicate in case you do not have a phone plan. Breakfast was great, and the facilities such as the pool and the chill out room were very pleasant. See you soon Serras Team!",5,2024,09,09

We have loved our stay",5,2024,09,08
18,Perfection,"If you visit Barcelona, stay here! Boutique (under 30 rooms), staff is incredible and so helpful to first timers in the city. 
Rooftop restaurant dinner was perfection. We will hopefully never stay anywhere else in Barcelona. 
Very helpful before we arrived, and beyond perfect every step of the way. Rooms are updated and very nice, it’s rare to say I have zero complaints but this place is perfect. Great location as well. 
Thank you Serras!!",5,2024,08,23
18,Serras Barcelona is Great,"First of all the location is excellent. It’s within walking distance of LasRamblas the harbor and the beach. It’s also a short taxi ride to the port if you’re on a cruise.
The hotel itself is charming – modern clean and beautifully decorated.
The staff is extraordinary, I never once had to open my own door in the lobby for anything and whenever I approached anyone at the desk, they were immediately on their feet.
Our room was well appointed 
I would certainly stay there again",5,2024,08,17
18,An awesome stay at The Serras Hotel Barcelona,"Amazing hotel in Barcelona. Within walking distance from everything Barcelona. 
Breakfast is fantastic and the service is excellent. Sandra the waitress was outstanding and very friendly. She helped us plan the rest of our trip to enjoy the best of Spain in the Costa Brava region.",5,2024,08,17
18,Exceptional on All Fronts,"We just came back from a 7 night stay at Serras from July 31-Aug 6. This boutique hotel is exceptional. The service is second to none. The staff greeted us warmly on arrival and each day after that. They helped with making recommendations and booking reservations for restaurants and tourist sites throughout our trip and before our arrival. The room was exceptionally clean and perfectly modern with a very very comfy bed (and pillow options if you’re fussy with your pillows like we are). The hotel rooftop and restaurant were lovely to have available as a retreat after a long day of sightseeing if you want to stay close to home base. The location is perfect for adventuring the Gothic Quarter and El Born on foot, lots of supermarkets, restaurants and sites within minutes. The hotel is smaller with less than 30 rooms so not the W, but that is part of the charm—the staff gets to know you and can personalize your experience. Lastly, the building is historic and was one of Picasso’s first studios so makes a neat experience to stay there when paired with a visit to the Picasso Museum. Loved our time in Barcelona, will be back and when we return will stay at Serras.",5,2024,08,11
18,Fabulous Barcelona Boutique Hotel,"What a find this hotel is!!! Situated just a short walk from the bottom of the Rambla, this gorgeous hotel exudes charm. The staff were absolutely extraordinary and the rooms are styled beautifully, super clean and comfortable. We enjoyed a drink in the upstairs bar and then had dinner in the restaurant, also upstairs. Food was delicious. All the staff from the porter to the check in desk to the bar and restaurant servers could not have been more helpful. Could not recommend this more highly. Would give six stars if I could!",5,2024,08,10
18,"Wonderful experience from start to finish!  Diego, Sandra and all employees were welcoming and very helpful.",This hotel and its employees are fantastic!

Special shoutout to Fran the bartender, such a nice guy with a great taste in drinks. He made us his own personal drinks and they were delicious. Would definitely recommend:)",5,2024,07,15
18,What a wonderful hotel!,"I have to admit, I was skeptical, but the stay turned out to be fantastic!

While the design isn't the most exciting in Barcelona, the location is excellent, and the staff consistently went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant stay. The sleeping comfort was top-notch, thanks to the double-glazed windows—essential in a bustling city like Barcelona. I slept wonderfully at Serras.

The room's cleanliness was impeccable, meeting my very high standards.

For those seeking timeless elegance, exceptional service, and a superb base in Barcelona, I highly recommend the Serras.",5,2024,07,06
18,5-Star Luxury in a 5-Star Location,"What a remarkable 4 nights we spent at Serras Hotel during our 1st trip to Barcelona! The location is second to none, backing up to the Gothic Quarter and facing Marina Port Vell. We were able to see so much of the city on foot, including the beaches. The hotel itself is modern and chic (and home to Picasso's 1st studio) with the most welcoming and professional staff, from the reception desk to the rooftop bar. We were greeted by Joao, who, along with his colleague Pao, offered us Cava, water, mimosas, hot towels, and delicious homemade chocolates, and informed us we'd been upgraded to a jaw-dropping Junior Suite as we are iPrefer members. He proceeded to give us a quick tour of this lovely boutique hotel, including the rooftop bar and pool, which we enjoyed several times during our stay (the view is expansive and awe-inspiring). Awaiting us in the room was complimentary chilled Cava (with a personalized bottle label!) and the hotel's homemade chocolates. Our corner Junior Suite was so well-appointed, including a full Jacuzzi tub, sitting area with a daybed and 2nd TV, and even a mobile phone to make free calls and texts around the city so we could keep our iPhones locked in the safe. Definitely the most comfortable bed and pillows we've ever enjoyed and incredible sound-proofed windows even though we were only 2 floors up from the street. We enjoyed a lovely dinner at Informal, the hotel's rooftop restaurant with a Michelin-starred chef, and we also had breakfast twice, with delicious buffet and a la carte options and charming service. With only 28 rooms and an abundance of capable staff always ready to open the front door, hail a cab or just ask how we liked a restaurant, the experience at Serras is stellar, and we're already planning to stay there again on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2024,07,01
18,Incredible,We enjoyed our stay at the Serras Hotel immensely. The service from every staff member was professional and genuinely welcoming and friendly. The rooms are lovely and intelligently laid out. The shower is perfect. We loved the nightly turndown treats and water. We had room service and ate in the restaurant multiple times and the food and service was perfection. Our included breakfast every morning was exceptional. We hope to return!,5,2024,06,26
18,Exceptional hotel with faultless 5* service!,"Can't fault one single thing about my time at the Serras Hotel - everything about it was truly exceptional. All the staff were so professional, friendly and helpful. The service was incredibly slick, food delicious, and the hotel itself is beautiful. I would highly recommend!",5,2024,06,26
18,simply magnificent,Conveniently located at the Gothic Quarter.  Service at the hotel is the best feature.  Warm welcomed when we first walked in the hotel.  We were provided with icy towels and welcome drinks.  We had an early flight at 8am so had to check out at 5ish.  the front desk had everything ready to go including coffee in takeaway cups! we were very impressed with the level of detail and thought that the management had put into everything.  The room is impeccably designed and it has the most comfortable mattress!!,5,2024,06,26
18,Serras is the gem of Barcelona,"The Serras hotel is an absolute dream. From the moment you arrive-even before you make it to the front door-the staff welcome you with warmth and compassion. The room was beautiful, the staff were absolutely incredible, and breakfast each morning was delicious. Sandra, the food manager, was an absolute delight. Our whole family fell in love with her. This is a place that truly gets it right-fantastic amenities, thoughtful touches and unrivaled hospitality. We can’t wait to return!",5,2024,06,23
18,Wonderful hotel!,"Wonderful location, amazing food, and exceptional service! This hotel was worth every penny. From the staffs attention to every detail, to being centrally located, to both the breakfast and rooftop bar offering an  amazing variety of food and the attention to detail.",5,2024,06,20
18,Excellent boutique hotel with welcoming staff,"We stayed at the Serras for 3 nights. The hotel is quite elegant and there is never a shortage of staff willing to assist you. 
The breakfast is exceptional and Sandra is very attentive to all the guests. They have a rooftop bar with a pool that overlooks the water and city which is an added bonus.",5,2024,06,18
18,STAY HERE,"Fabulous hotel and staff. Great location . Rooms are lovely- but do book up from smallest room size for 2 people if you are there several nights. The staff is amazing- so friendly and helpful and attentive. Definitely book one dinner( or more) in their restaurant, Informal. I stayed there twice in one month I can’t recommend it highly enough!!",5,2024,06,15
18,Wonderful stay,The staff was amazing and friendly! Diego told us all the great places to visit.  The hotel is beautiful. The food on the rooftop was delicious and late night drinks were amazing. Everything was within walking distance.  We can't wait to go back!,5,2024,06,10
18,Great location and friendly staff,"Staff were top notch - friendly, helpful while we were there and exceptionally responsive and helpful setting up various reservations around the city in advance of our stay. Location in the Born neighborhood was fantastic for walking in the city and the room was comfortable and the soundproofing was a nice extra.",5,2024,06,05
18,Exceptional!,"Serras Barcelona Hotel is exceptional! Stylish design, impeccable service, and a prime location. The rooftop pool and bar provide breathtaking views of the city. Rooms are spacious, luxurious, and comfortable. A top choice for any Barcelona stay!",5,2024,05,30
18,Will return to this lovely city hotel,We had 2 nights before a work trip so met my husband here and decided to follow the TripAdvisor reviews that it was a great place to stay. We weren't disappointed.  We took an upgraded room over the city and the room was lovely and a good size for a city hotel. They accommodated us with a slightly later check out which was great and all staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good but not cheap bit service by the pool great and prices more reasonable so on the 2nd day we had brunch instead upstairs. We dined in the in hotel restaurant which was ok. Not outstanding I would say but we enjoyed it nevertheless. ,4,2024,05,26
18,Serras takes perfection to the next level,"Serras Barcelona takes perfection to the next level. Their attention to detail, caring staff are just the epitome of the perfect stay.  Clean, comfortable beds, handmade chocolates, steamer and a hair straightener available in the room. Every little detail was thought of. And the most incredible turn down service with hand crafted chocolates and treats. I stayed in February for the 1/2 marathon race, and was travelling solo for a few days. What an incredible experience. Well situated in the city, close to the waterfront, park and train station, the location is just perfect. A belated thank you for making my first trip to Barcelona and first race such an amazing and memorable one, your hotel and restaurant and staff are absolutely top notch. Thank you for an incredible stay.",5,2024,05,21
18,World Class Service,"Just returned from Barcelona and want to commend the Serras staff for amazing service all week! Augustina, Eric, Pablo and every other member of the team were extremely respectful, attentive and diligent and always friendly. Sandra, the breakfast manager, and her team were equally fantastic in every way. They are the reason I will stay at Serras whenever I return.",5,2024,05,20
18,Must Stay in Barcelona,"Top notch from start to finish. We started our trip in Barcelona before heading on a cruise to celebrate 20 years of marriage. We were warmly greeted by the staff at our car upon arrival. This small, boutique style hotel is quiet, exceptionally clean with the most gracious staff. Although we only spent a couple of days, we will plan to return again.",5,2024,05,18
18,Unforgettable experience,"Serras Barcelona is an outstanding boutique hotel in the Gothic Quarter. It offers modern luxury, stunning Mediterranean views, and exceptional service. The stylish rooms, rooftop terrace with a pool, and the fantastic Informal restaurant by Marc Gascons make it a perfect stay. Its central location near major attractions and tranquil ambiance create an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended.",5,2024,05,16
18,They made me a believer,"I'll be honest I was close to giving this hotel 4 stars,  but the service and the restaurant were just so above standards I had to give them a 5. First the negatives.  We had one of the smaller rooms,  but the need was incredibly comfortable and the storage was excellent.  My nits were the bathroom had an opaque glass wall so you could see your partner sitting on the toilet from the bed.  Been married 33 years and there are times we want privacy,  not sure if this is some European thing or not like their constant need to have open showers that get water on the marble floor so you can slip and break your hip.  Also the toilet is to tall.  I'm 6 foot and my feet are on tip toe, bad install I suspect. 
With all that I still gave them a 5 because of the service.  I usually read about food service and kind of ignore it,  but they were just so incredibly helpful at exactly the right times and so sincere from the door to the desk to the bar and the restaurant.  Speaking of which I rarely go to hotel restaurants but went to their ""Informal"" on the roof and the food was absolutely amazing,  hands down or best meal in Barcelona with a great evening view and again great service.  Lastly,  the rooftop.  Small but nice and again the staff were great.  Out of nowhere a guy comes and offers to clean my glasses.  I was so shocked I said no,  but truth is they needed it and I immediately regretted it.  Who does that? What a wonderful touch.  Never left the building they didn't offer a bottle water for our walk.  By the time we left I was more than willing to overlook the minor issues with the room, but for God's sake please at least put up a curtain in the bathroom. ",5,2024,05,15
18,You Can't Beat Serras,"What a wonderful place! The Serras was perfectly located along the marina and at the edge of the Gothic Quarter. With a rooftop bar/restaurant and an intimate breakfast dining room, any dining option was readily available to guests. The rooms were well-appointed, and the bathrooms were spacious and modern, with plenty of counter space. 
Most of all, the staff was absolutley wonderful to deal with. They were pleasant, helpful and very competent. We recommend the Serras to anyone thinking of visiting Barcelona.",5,2024,05,13
18,"Serras Barcelona, Five Star in every way","The experience at Serras Barcelona was truly the epitome of a Five Star experience in the most comfortable setting ever. The location and amenities were outstanding, food and drink perfect, the common spaces are beautifully designed for relaxation and enjoyment. The real pinnacle of our vacation was the staff. Extremely knowledgeable of all the incredible city of Barcelona has to offer, the recommendations were on the mark.  Especially noted should be Anastasia, who made our dining destinations a taste of the city we so loved. A true five star accommodation without the pretentiousness.",5,2024,05,11
18,Wonderful Hotel with Amazing Service,"The Serra was perfect. We loved this quaint boutique hotel, and the service was truly the best I think we’ve ever had…from the time our car arrived until the time we left we were treated like family.in addition, the location was ideal, situated right in the Gothic Quarter and also with direct views of the marina/port. 

We had dinner one evening at the restaurant and it was fantastic, we also enjoyed cocktails at the rooftop bar and breakfast daily in the restaurant.

Everything was top notch!",5,2024,05,11
18,Exceptional all the way!,"This is a great boutique hotel located close to the water. Has great food and such excellent service. The valet person went out in the down pouring rain just to get us a taxi. And there was another time when taxi’s were just impossible due to a city event that he even had to crossed to the next street. And the one that goes above and beyond is Queen Sandra. She first learned who I was and what I like the next morning as soon as I was about to sit she ask Americano? And had the second cup brewing 15 mins later. She really catered to our needs. She asked us what time we were leaving which was way before she opens, she came in earlier and packed us a hearty breakfast to go. She does this with no hesitation all filled with love and willingness. She’s such a great mom. We will miss you Sandra. 
Thank you for everything. 
Jessie Deloso.",5,2024,05,09
18,Outstanding boutique hotel.,"The rooms were all you would expect, but it was the service that was over the top. Sandra, who has been there breakfast manager for seven years personifies the kind of excellence that is felt throughout the property. 

They provided the kind of experience that the big luxury chains simply can’t.",5,2024,05,06
18,THIS IS A MUST ABSOLUTELY,"Wow just wow. I come from Nordstrom and the service is next level- kind, caring genuine, authentic. This is like family and we wi be back for sure. Especially thank you Jose and Sandra gorgeous humans and ambassadors for this gorgeous hotel and city. 

See you soon y’all",5,2024,05,06
18,Serras Barcelona - what a fantastic stay!,"This hotel is beautiful, comfortable and the location is perfect but what really stands out for us is the STAFF of this hotel are simply outstanding.  We immediately felt welcome, they were warm and friendly, attentive without being intrusive and we looked forward to every interaction with them.  Agustina at the front desk and Sandra in the lobby restaurant where we had breakfast each morning were particularly thoughtful and deserve special mentions as making our stay here very special.",5,2024,05,06
18,Simply the best !,"Coming to Barcelona? You must stay at serras the hotel is simply fantastic, we previously visited in 2015 and  needed to return, hotel is situated away from Ramblas 6 min walk away and . few minutes to gothic quarter . Hotel decor chic and service truly 5 star , staff treat u so well and go out their way to make ur stay truly memorable. All staff knowledgable of restaurants and things to do . In the area 
Roof top bar and pool area to chill out , with heaters if a bit cold",5,2024,05,04
18,"Professional staff, great location","Great location, Great A/C, Great sleep. Really appreciated the proximity to the beach and other main tourist sites. Very professional staff. A/C was excellent and you need it in August!",5,2024,04,28
18,The only place to stay in Barcelona!,"Dates of Stay: 21-24 April
From Check-in with Augustina - the Cava & Chocolate - the Tour of the impeccable property and the oh so comfortable room that was spacious and sleek!
The Doormen/Porters were so efficient - going out in the rain to get us a taxi…
Breakfast was nice and the highlight was “Queen” Sandra and their staff who were so helpful in serving us and giving us tips for our stay!
The Informal Restaurant at the top floor was also very good!
The GM, Carla, even spent some time with us!
Overall - 6-Star experience!",5,2024,04,28
18,A Fabulous Barcelona Hotel!,"Fabulous!  The hotel itself is just lovely.  The room was very nice with a small balcony. The hotel restaurant and bar area are a plus.  A really nice location across from the sea and close to many sights by foot.   But the most memorable and important component, the staff!  We have never stayed at a hotel with so many pleasant and competent staff.  Everyone is so kind and willing to meet every need you many have.  From the minute you enter you are greeted with a smile and in our case a glass of bubbly!  Thank you to all for making our stay in Barcelona so wonderful!  I was so sad to leave but so positive that we will return again one day!",5,2024,04,25
18,Superb service in beautiful boutique hotel near shopping,"4 adults agreed when we return to Barcelona, we will stay at Hotel Serras again! The service was over the top!  The staff called us by name throughout our visit and could not have been more helpful.  Checking out was like saying goodbye to our friends.  The rooms were very nice and the shower was extraordinary!  The rooftop bar is fun and comfortable although it was rather windy during our stay. The coffee in the lobby is superior to any we’ve had elsewhere. The location of Hotel Serras was perfect as it was walkable to the restaurants and shopping areas of the Gothic Quarter; it is walkable to the fabulous not-to-be-missed Mercat San Josep (fresh fish, sweets, breads, etc. market).  From there we walked up Passeig de Gracia, the famous shopping street. (We did get a taxi to take us back to the hotel as we were pretty tired after all the walking.)  I cannot imagine a better place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2024,04,22
18,Full payment required on check in NOT check out,They did not make it clear IN ADVANCE that full payment was required at check in NOT check out. It was a miserable experience being nagged each day for upfront  payment. The bill was settled in full at the end of our 2 day stay but it was a miserable experience. It tarnished the short stay break.,1,2024,04,18
18,Wonderful stay! Walking distance to la Rambla.,"First-rate check in experience. Staff friendly, supportive and helpful. Beautiful room #207. Excellent accommodations! Shower and amenities were so nice. Fun rooftop bar and tho limited menu and somewhat bland by American standards we enjoyed our dishes. Breakfast buffet was delicious as well as the a la carte menu and the breakfast manager, Sandra, was so welcoming and gracious every morning. Loved her. She was fabulous. Ask for her! Her smile is radiant! Full of light!",5,2024,04,14
18,Amazing hotel,"Serras Barcelona is an exceptional hotel, in large part because of the fabulous staff.  Everyone was so welcoming and helpful, but the best was Sandra the breakfast manager.  She made me and my two children feel at home from day one.  From learning our names immediately, having our drink orders ready the minute we sat down to  checking to see if my kids slept okay, she was amazing.  Made us feel at home away from home.  My son already made me promise that we would go back to visit her in a few years!",5,2024,04,07
18,Very 4*,"We were generously upgraded to the Junior Suite by booking through our agent, but even the suite was only 40sqm and was a little tight. The room itself is very four stars. There was no welcome amenity as described in our booking, but instead there was a small cake. Service overall was very good, food, we thought was excellent, but a bit salty. We were told they were meant to be salty traditionally. 

Breakfast was basic and there’s an additional 16 euro charge for an avocado toast. 

The location is charming but nowhere near designer stores. The reason I can’t give five stars is because it was not cheap and at that price, I expected perfection. The housekeeping kept forgetting to replenish various things throughout our 4 night stay. Maybe they can implement a checklist system to ensure we don’t have to keep asking for basic things like toilet paper, cotton buds, etc. 

Overall, it was okay but given the price point, I don’t think I’d stay here again.",4,2024,04,05
18,The Best of Barcelona,Let me start with the best service of any hotel we've ever experienced around the world. Each of the front desk people were simply amazing. The room was decent size with a large bathroom and shower. Closet space also quite adequate. The location at the southern edge of the Gothic Quarter was terrific! We highly recommend Serras Barcelona!!,5,2024,03,19
18,Best of the best,"Wonderful, cozy hotel with well-designed rooms in a great location. Service is next level —everyone who works at the hotel is exemplary, and truly cares.  I’ve stayed at many luxury properties and none have come close.  While the team truly stood out helping through a difficult situation with a flight cancellation (and went beyond any expectations), the team was wonderful throughout the stay and made for a fabulous stay. Food also is terrific.  It should be a first choice in Barcelona.",5,2024,03,18
18,Luxury boutique hotel in a great location and offering exceptional service,"A beautiful boutique hotel in a great location for exploring Barcelona.  I can't compare it to other hotels in Barcelona but relative to other boutique luxury hotels I've stayed on elsewhere this is very, very, good.  The room was comfortable and spacious and the bathroom was quite large.  We did not use the rooftop bar but it looked quite nice and has a great view over the waterfront.  The staff were incredibly nice and everyone went out of their way to talk with us each day and help with reservations/taxis.  I would have no reason to stay anywhere else when returning to Barcelona.",5,2024,03,15
18,Great Barcelona,"A unique architecture in a building that was once Picasso's residence. Just a few minutes' walk from Barceloneta beach, the Rambla and the Gothic Quarter.

Attention and care in detail, from reception, breakfast, concierge support to attractions, restaurants and transport.

The package between Andorra and Barcelona in Serra provided a great trip to southern Europe!

Gracias",5,2024,03,11
18,Home away from home,"Can’t say enough wonderful things about the Serras and its staff. I’ve stayed here for business twice and had such an amazing experience. My company even hosted an event on the rooftop terrace that received rave reviews. Special thanks to Maima, Rosa, Marta, Sandra, Anastasiya, and the rest of the Serras team for making our stay seamless and elevated during an extremely busy time.",5,2024,03,01
18,Better than 5 Stars!,"Serras Barcelona has easily become my favorite hotel. The attention to detail is unlike other hotels, but what really makes it the best is the warm, attentive, super wonderful staff. Sandra, Serras’ breakfast manger, watches over guests’ needs as if she were hosting them in her own home. Will definitely come back!",5,2024,02,29
18,Perfect Boutique Experience,The hotel is quiet and perfectly appointed. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They make you feel at home from the minute you walk in the door. Sandra the breakfast manager was delightful and anticipated our every need. We will be back!,5,2024,02,27
18,An easy 5 stars for an excellent hotel,"A lot of hotels we have stayed at have had very good service, Serras takes customer service to the next level. We stayed 4 nights for my birthday, and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made to feel welcome and special. Whilst every member of staff we came across was excellent, I have to mention Sandra at breakfast, who was exceptional. She helped to set us up for the day perfectly, nothing was ever too much trouble. The staff are a real credit and asset to Serras.
The hotel is perfectly placed for sightseeing and inside, is a haven of calm and quiet luxury. Housekeeping for our room was perfect, it was immaculately clean and well maintained, and the little cake left in the evening after turndown was a lovely touch. 
If we return to Barcelona we would definitely stay here again, and I would have no hesitation recommending it. Finally, I’d like to thank everybody at Serras for making our stay really enjoyable and memorable.",5,2024,02,18
18,Great Hotel & even better service!,"Great Hotel, with awesome location close to    barceloneta, gothic & born neighborhoods & las ramblas.

18,"Perfect mix of location, quality and service.","Serras offers a perfect mix of location, quality and service. Me and my wife had a wonderful long weekend stay. We loved being right in front of the port as it is a short stroll to the Barceloneta beach and next the barrio gótico. We stayed in one of the grand deluxe rooms overlooking the port and it was well equipped and spacious. I used the gym a couple of times and, although rather compact, the treadmill and crosstrainer were top notch. Breakfast was a highlight. The team is super friendly and the food selection delicious.  We have stayed in Barcelona multiple times and Serras now ranks at the top of our hotel list for future visits.",5,2024,01,23
18,Gothic Quarter Romance,"We stayed at Serras at the tail-end of an epic honeymoon trip, and very much saved the best for last. Located in prime location within the Gothic quarters, we walked to majority of sights or dinner reservations within the city. The staff was incredibly attentive right from the beginning, adjusting to the more hand-off approach my wife and I preferred. Very glad we booked reservation at Informal our first night as it was one of the best meals we have in Barca, and the nighttime view from the roof really set a romantic tone for the rest of time in Barca. Recommend this hotel without a second hesitation, will certainly make our way back.",5,2024,01,14
18,Great spotp,We really enjoyed our short stay and look forward to coming back in June. I would book up from their standard size room as it was very small. Dinner at Informal was delicious. Good location and very friendly staff. ,5,2024,01,01
18,"Outstanding staff, ideal location. ","All the people were lovely. Our room was spacious, good beds, tasty decoration. The location of the hotel is very convenient, almost in the heart of the city and close to Barceloneta. Our only little disappointment was that despite the description of the room when we booked it as having a ""Old City"" view, there was actually no view at all. This is actually the case with all the rooms except the front ones. But again all the people working in this hotel from the manager to the cleaning staff are just lovely and this is what tipped my review from 4 to 5 stars. ",5,2023,12,30
18,"Refuge, pampering boutique hotel offering refuge from sightseeing and visiting museums etc…","Definitely a luxury boutique hotel. So wonderful to be pampered and have staff that go out of their way for you. A refuge after you experience the Beauty of Barcelona. Near beach, go this area, ramblas, Picasso museum etc.. Daughter had been studying abroad in Barcelona. We walked, took metro, went to par Güell, Sagrada familia, looked a Gaudí buildings and everything was nearby. Definitely recommend and you are treated like gold. ",5,2023,12,27
18,Amazing stay,"Serras Barcelona is a wonderful hotel. From the moment we stepped foot into the hotel, the staff's attentiveness made the stay very personable. The staff made recommendations of things to do and places to eat in Barcelona and their recommendations were spot on. The hotel is artistic and gives off relaxed vibes. The rooms are also clean. Bathroom is very spacious and we liked the double sink along with the separate toilet room. Breakfast can be included at additional cost and the staff taking care of breakfast has just been lovely. We also had dinner at Restaurante Informal. While service was impeccable, we were slightly disappointed in the food. However this did not detract from our stay at all. The night before checkout we also received a call asking if we need help coordinating a ride, which was much appreciated. ",5,2023,12,26
18,Highly recommend!,"We fell in love with the Serras Barcelona and highly recommend it for others.  The location is perfect, the staff is incredible, and the hotel is beautiful. We especially appreciated all of the amenities in the room and felt completely at home!  Can't wait to return one day and stay there again!",5,2023,12,11
18,A wonderful GEM in the Gothic Quarter,"There is a reason this gem of a hotel consistently appears on Barcelona lists for “best boutique” hotels.  Had a lovely 3-day stay in this iconic building on the waterfront side of the Gothic Quarter that once was Picasso’s early art studio.  Close to everything, the rooms are stylish, very quiet and nicely furnished. The restaurant is a great place for breakfast, and the Breakfast / Lunch dining manager Sandra gets a special mention - a gracious and helpful hostess, she sets the standard for great service. Breakfasts are delicious.  The staff is mostly young but attentive.  I would definitely choose this hotel for future visits to Barcelona. Oh - the rooftop deck is magnificent and a relaxing way to unwind.",5,2023,12,05
18,Escape,"A truly recharging place from long workdays at the comvention, and also a superb location for all evening events. I will come back for a reatreet and i good place for spooling our selfs.

18,Wonderful Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed here (late November) and had a fantastic experience. The hotel is exactly as described elsewhere, “…luxury boutique hotel”.  The room was decent size, very comfortable and the soundproofing was great.  We were on the second floor overlooking the water which had us above Passeig de Colom which is a busy road.  Only the loudest of street sounds made it into the room.  As for location we could not have been happier.  Right in the Gothic Quarter there are so many beautiful small narrow streets to explore with great options for food/Tapas.  Within walking distance to Las Ramblas, Sagrada de Familia and other sites.
The photos on their website are accurate for what you will see when staying there.  While we did not dine at the on-site restaurant (Rooftop) which is supposed to be fantastic, we did enjoy the roof top bar area.  As much as we loved the hotel, the staff really made the stay extra nice.  Every staff member that we interacted with was fantastic and helpful.  ",5,2023,11,30
18,What a super boutique hotel,"It’s been such a pleasure staying at Hotel Serras and using it as our base to get to know Barcelona. I can’t recommend this boutique hotel highly enough, the staff, the interiors, the restaurant and the location all fantastic.
It’s a family owned and run hotel led by Carla Serra and her team who have created a refined and intimate property, where nothing is too much trouble from helping us with directions, restaurant recommendations or just having a chat about life. It feels personal which is a strong differentiator in an environment which is increasingly corporate and impersonal. Here check-in is a comfortable affair, seated in the light airy reception area, sipping fine cava, and enjoying a chocolate treat, The treats continued when we got to the room as it was my husbands birthday with welcome birthday cake and a bottle of Cava and a hand written note from Carla Serra. The hotel interiors are all contemporary, comfortable and relaxing, we particularly enjoyed using the library and the rooftop terrace which had fantastic views over the Marina. We will definitely be back.",5,2023,11,30
18,Perfect,"This is a great little hotel. Clean, friendly and lovely location. When walking around Barcelona I spotted other hotels I’d been considering which were on busy roads or off small side streets. Serras was opposite Port Vell set back off a palm tree lined main road. The rooms were so sound proof this wasn’t an issue at all and the road wasn’t that busy. It’s great if you want to dip in and out of Barcelona without being right in heart of the busyness which suited us perfectly. Staff were so lovely and accommodating. ",5,2023,11,30
18,Must stay in Barcelona!,"A gem in Barcelona worth experiencing. Great location, decor and exceptional room amenities.

Beyond living up to the luxury one would expect in a hotel like this, we were particularly struck by the warm culture of all the staff at Serras Barcelona.  Interactions always went well beyond formal pleasantries to really understand, appreciate, support, and improve the experience we were having in Barcelona at large.  At the heart of this staff culture is an absolute gem of a personality - SANDRA.  Sandra's personal touch, attention to making every detail absolutely perfect for us made us feel like we were her own family.  In fact, as we reminisce about our entire trip Sandra always comes up as a highlight.

Breakfast is one of the best hotel breakfast's I've had for quality, service and choice plus the staff at breakfast are incredible (the lady serving us - sorry we don't know her name) would even bring another coffee before you could ask! Amazing service. 

The rooftop bar is small but perfectly formed and we enjoyed a drink there looking out across the views. The hotel itself is in a great location walking distance to lots of great restaurants, bars, shops and the waterfront.

We would not hesitate to stay here again as everything was perfect.",5,2023,10,31

The rooms were beautiful and had plenty of natural light. It would be awesome to see something like this implemented in other cities. We greatly appreciate the comfortable stay.",5,2023,10,24
18,Best of the best for our honeymoon 💙,"Well, we stayed in Spain for 3 weeks for our honeymoon.  The Serras was our favorite of all the 5 star hotels hands down.

Despitethe volume of choices at this price point, I have no doubt that the privacy, food, service, location and communication style of this hotel, in sum, was a great value compared to others. We received more than what other large luxury chains offer in my opinion and based on experience at this price point. 

Cleanliness: impeccably clean and I loved the Diptyque toiletries, complimentary mini bar and water. It was just like home. 

Room tips: we stayed in a suite (506) and it was perfect for a 4 night stay as it provided a separate living and sleeping area plus access to fresh air via a narrow balcony. 

Special thanks for Carla and her front desk staff. It’s rare to see folks both dedicated and skilled at their craft in the hospitality industry. I believe it is a trade that not everyone can do well.  I can’t wait to visit their upcoming Seville location! PS try all of the food but especially the coconut cake at breakfast.

But the service.  The service is why you stay.  I had 15 outstanding days.  This crew made my stay the trip of a lifetime.  The concierge services were first rate.  Recommendations, little touches in room and even help sending a package.  Thoughtful, kind, respectful.

Rooms are well-appointed and spotless.  Cleaning service outstanding.  No visible wear and ""tiredness"".  Maintenance standards are 10/10.

It was the Breakfast Manager Sandra who ""knocked it out of the park"".  She treated me like I belonged to Barcelona.  She knew what I liked, had it ready for me and even shared her favorite books and  Netflix.

I run a company.  My employees are my biggest asset.  Employees like Sandra and the Serras crew are fantastic.  

Stay here.  Don't choose another option.  Just don't.  I've lived out of alot of suitcases.  Make this pla e your home-base to explore beautiful Barcelona.

18,Outstanding small hotel!,"We have stayed at the hotel twice now - small and intimate with some of the best service we have ever seen. 

Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and completely helpful, without ever being cloying. 

Rooms were spacious by European standards, modern and perfectly clean. Excellent rooftop terrace with a small pool and view over the marina. Restaurant has moved to the rooftop - great decision for al fresco dining. The menu is not large but offers something for everyone. Food quality is top notch. 

Not inexpensive but well worth it!",5,2023,09,02
18,Amazing Hotel. Great Location,"We had a thoroughly delightful stay at the Serras Hotel. This gem of a boutique hotel has justly earned a five star rating.

Sandra’s professionalism, and attention to detail is far superior to any I have experienced anywhere else. The rooms are beautifully cleaned and the beds are amazingly comfortable. You will not regret staying in this beautiful boutique. 
Thankyou to all the staff for making us so welcome.

18,Outstanding hotel and excellent on all fronts,"First of all, I would like to thank the Serras team for all the valuable suggestions for our stay. Once again, I had a wonderful time in the Serras hotel in Barcelona (regular visitor), and, especially the culinary experience was perfect thanks to their Food and Beverage Director. The food was wonderful and the service impeccable.

Next time I hope that we will have time to visit their other beautiful property in Torre del Remei. 

Once again, thank you so much for the wonderful time and for the Serras experience, being able to finish the summer vacations in one my favorite hotels. 
This hotel offers very high comforts such as comfortable high-end beds, crispy sheets and bedding, room soundproofing, quality food, and beverages, beautiful rooftop with the pool and beautiful restaurant. The Serras goes back to the idea that the devil is in the details.

The front desk staff greeted us with champagne and left a personalized note in our room - all of them amazing, and their effort to make our experience incredible was felt. The hotel itself from the room to the rooftop was exquisite. Everyone in the restaurants also made us feel welcome especially Sandra (she was amazing) who made us feel like family. Sandra knew our coffee orders after one day, would give us recommendations and make us feel so comfortable, and her thoughtfulness really added to our overall experience. Highly recommend! ",5,2023,07,31
18,Unmatched Service in a Beautiful Hotel,"Serras exceeded all of our expectations.  The hotel is stunning and in a fantastic location.  We were extremely well taken care of the moment we walked in until we sadly checked out.

18,Friendly Beautiful Hotel,"This was our second time staying at this hotel, we came back because we loved our first time.  The staff is outstanding, always ready to help with cars, reservations, touring suggestions, and much more.  They reached out to me before our stay asking if they could help with anything and responded quickly to my requests making our stay that much enjoyable.  They helped setup car service from the port to the hotel and hotel to airport.  The car was at the port early and contacted me as soon as he was there.  He helped with our luggage and took us directly to the hotel where we dropped off our bags and went out to explore the city.  Our room fit 3 comfortably, they had sparkling wine and some snacks waiting for us.  They helped make us dinner reservations on the Rooftop where we had a very delicious dinner.   The bathroom was a good size for 3 people and the beds were comfortable.  They did a turn down service during our dinner where they restocked the towels, left a nice dessert, and gave us each a new bottle of water.  We felt very taken care of during our stay and will stay here again next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2023,07,12
18,Great hotel,"Beautiful modern small hotel, right on the water. Location is great, on the edge of Barri Gotic. Rooms really comfortable, nice bathroom. They give complimentary delicious chocolates at checkin, in the room, and turn down service. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Breakfast was nice, especially the watermelon juice.",5,2023,07,11
18,One of the best hotels in Barcelona,"Really wonderful hotel. Beautiful large room with really comfy beds. 
Breakfast 10/10. Everything you need is in the small buffet or is made. 
Rooftop bar is a very nice place to hang around but could use some umbrellas for shade. Food and drinks are amazing. 
Staff very friendly.
Will certainly return!",5,2023,07,09
18,Amazing Hotel!,"This hotel is Amazing!  I feel like it is a hidden gem with an amazing location,  Gorgeous suites, and exceptional service!  From the moment we arrived we were impressed with the service and the quality of their amenities.  Everyone was kind and helpful, and our room was amazing!",5,2023,07,06
18,Top-notch hotel with outstanding hospitality and warmth! Perfect location!,"We absolutely loved every minute of our stay at the Serras Hotel! From the moment we arrived we felt as if family was welcoming us home. Anastasia greeted us so warmly upon arrival, which was absolutely a reflection of the gracious hospitality we experienced daily from every member of the staff at the Serras. And the breakfast manager, Sandra, was truly exceptional! She made our family feel as if we have a new, dear friend in Barcelona! We can’t wait to return to this beautiful city, and to our new friends at the Serras Hotel!",5,2023,07,03
18,Perfect hotel that holds a special place in our hearts!,"We can’t really put into words how we really feel about the Serras, but simply put we will forever be grateful for this wonderful, wonderful hotel as they delivered our dream wedding. Our wedding was everything we could have ever hoped for and more at the Serras on the rooftop, with a gorgeous sit down meal curated by their chef Marc Gascons. All of our guests were blown away and many said it was the best wedding they’ve ever been to and even more said it was the best food they’ve ever had! This is in huge thanks to their incredible events manager Rosa and also the fabulous catering staff, chefs and everybody else who had any part in our 3 night stay and wedding! 

We hope to return whenever we are able to, at least for anniversaries, this hotel will hold a special place in our hearts for the rest of our lives! Thank you so much to everybody. Truly a 5 star hotel, food, rooms, drinks are all gorgeous! The day after the wedding I ordered room service and got in the jacuzzi bath to ease my hangover and the food was incredible! Best room service I’ve ever had. And very happy to see that the jacuzzi bath was immaculate, no limescale or grime at all shooting out of the jets! 

If you want relaxed luxury in the heart of Barcelona with beautiful views, food and location then this is your spot!",5,2023,07,02
18,Lovely botique hotel,"Large room facing the water with great amenities like a dyson blowdryer.  At arrival and throughout our stay the staff at the front desk were friendly and personable, full of great recommendations for exploring the area.  The pool is quite small, but the rooftop bar is a great spot to hang out and the bar staff were really nice and fun to talk to.",5,2023,06,29
18,Outstanding,"We really had some of the best service in a hotel ever. The staff is super attentive, helpful, and they really care about the guest experience. From the time we walked in until the time we left, the staff was there to give suggestions, offer a drink, and get the appropriate taxi. I can’t say enough about the hotel. ",5,2023,06,28
18,This is not a five star hotel,"It does not get better than this. This should be rated 6 stars plus. Absolutely everything about this place is sensational. The staff cannot do enough for you. From the moment you check in throughout the stay the service is second to none. It is hard to leave the hotel and go out sight seeing.  The rooftop bar and restaurant is next level.  We had friends stay in The W, it is second rate compared to Serras. Serras is Not pretentious, just very caring in every possible way.",5,2023,06,26
18,Beautiful Boutique Hotel,"Serras is a beautiful boutique hotel located in a very good location close to fine dining restaurants, near the harbor and beach, and close to many attractions including open markets and tourist attractions. 
Every single staff member is extremely friendly and helpful. ",5,2023,06,20
18,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"My husband and I visited Barcelona for 3 days (4 nights) while we were visiting family for 2 weeks in England. The hotel is exactly as described on their website.  A 28 room modern, stylish hotel with a great little rooftop bar. At the end of each day we enjoyed the view and well made cocktails. 

Upon our arrival we were greeted and seated and the front desk with chocolate and a glass of cava. The staff spoke to us in English, which was nice for us. I saved my courage to speak my few words of Catalan and highschool Spanish for outside the hotel. 

We were taken on a quick tour of the hotel and then to our room which was upgraded to a mini suite with a welcome gift of a chilled bottle of Cava and more chocolate!

We had a mini bar and complimentary tea and Nespresso coffee. The bathroom had a jacuzzi tub which I used twice after long days of site seeing and walking. Diptyque bath products, hairdryer, hair straightener, magnifying mirror and bathrobes were all provided. 

Turn down service, slippers, bottles of water and a mini pastry was provided each evening. 

Two closets with full length mirrors, drawers and a safe kept all of our things nearly contained. 

The location was perfect for us. Many shops, bars and restaurants. 
We felt we made the perfect choice. The hotel and staff helped make this trip unforgettable!

",5,2023,06,12
18,Super stay,"Fantastic hotel - great location and super service. Everyone was very helpful. The breakfast was excellent and Sandra (the breakfast manager) made the stay special. Even our 7 year old loved the attention he got. The rooftop restaurant (informal) was also our best meal over 5 days despite eating at other great restaurants in the city. 

The views from the rooftop were lovely and “the crepes at breakfast were the best ever” (from our 7 year old)",5,2023,06,10
18,Sandra’s Serras,"Excellent facilities location and service at the Serras Hotel Barcelona. Outstanding roof top pool,  bar and restaurant with fantastic views of the harbour.  Especially enjoyed breakfast served by Sandra who took an interest in our itinerary. Wonderful experience gracias ",5,2023,06,09
18,Fantastic Hotel & Great Service,All the staff at The Serras were very courteous and welcoming. An extra call out to Sandra the Breakfast Manager who made our stay that much more special every morning while having breakfast in the hotel’s beautiful dining area,5,2023,06,07
18,A wonderful stay,"Terrific hotel. Like boutique type hotels. Room quiet despite busy location. Double pain glass on slider to patio most likely the reason. The food was exceptional. Sandra in the breakfast area was a tremendous help in many areas. Only recommendation i would make , is to get a nite lite in bathrooms and to get softer pillows",5,2023,06,06
18,Wonderful hotel,Beautiful small hotel with amazing staff and wonderful food. Would stay here again any time. Superb location near to amenities and in a lovely area for walks / drinks. Staff could not have done more to make our stay exceptional ,5,2023,06,06
18,Lovely modern hotel in great location,"The Serras is beautifully designed small hotel with decor that is elegant and modern. The staff were all exceptional, very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and well appointed although smaller than I had expected for the price paid. It was also facing a busy road which I hadn't expected however the room is very well insulated and we weren't bothered by any road noise. The hotel is in a great location within a short walk of the marina and beach and La Rambla. We only had breakfast and a couple of drinks but the quality was excellent. Overall a high quality base for exploring Barcelona.",4,2023,06,05
18,Great Experience,Great experience. So cosy and beautiful hotel with lot of space! I spend a week here and I regret that I didn't spend more time in this Excellent hotel. I will be there one more time next year! thanks ,5,2023,06,02
18,Truly great experience at Serras,"I cannot say enough about our stay at this hotel.  We stayed only one night at Serras as we were leaving for a Mediterranean cruise the next day, but the next time we visit Barcelona we will be sure to stay longer. Everyone, top to bottom, was so friendly, helpful, professional, and accommodating.  The room, decor, location (Gothic Quarter), and dining were fantastic. Dinner on the roof and breakfast the next morning were both memorable experiences. The amenities in our room were well done and thoughtful.  The hotel is in walking distance to sooo much! The whole staff was truly fantastic but Rafael (not sure of the spelling) was particularly helpful.  Just all very well done, looking forward to returning.",5,2023,05,31
18,Excellent stay,"A lovely hotel with super friendly staff. The rooftop pool area with sunbeds, pool and bar is great. Breakfast was among the best hotel breakfasts I’ve had. Warm recommendation all over and a perfect location.",5,2023,05,31
18,A good discovery !,"Everything is there in this cozy hotel to have an excellent stay, from the welcome at check-in, to the friendliness of the staff, from the quality of the room to the very pleasant breakfast, congratulations to the whole team, we we'll be back!",5,2023,05,30
18,Special home away from home.,"From the moment that we walked through the door greeted by Raffaello we felt cared for. He took our bags (quite a few) waited with them while we changed because our room was not ready yet,  (it was well before checkin time), and then stored them away safely so that we could explore the city. 
Each and every staff member we encountered was exceptional. 
Sandra the breakfast manager is a gem! You feel as though she is welcoming you into her home each morning. She remembers each guest, their preferences, and she takes the time to speak with each person during your meal. 
Dinner on the rooftop is also not to be missed, from the perfect local wine recommendation to beautiful and delicious food, it was an experience. 
The hotel is perfectly located to explore the waterfront and city. This is the perfect home away from home when visiting Barcelona!",5,2023,05,30
18,Well-located boutique hotel with great service in Barcelona,"The hands-on service was evident from the moment we waked into Serras, as the concierge checked us in and offered complimentary champagne, hand towels and water. We needed dinner reservations our first night, within walking distance and casual since we had a long travel day, and the concierge made the reservation for us. Our room was comfortable and the upgraded windows ensured we didn't hear anything from the busy streets below (our room was on floor 2).
The first morning I got up early to walk around the city a bit, and Sandra at the breakfast area made me a perfect coffee to-go. (She then remembered my coffee order and had it ready to go each subsequent morning for the three days we were there - so nice!!) Sandra also was delightful to chat with, cheery and attentive at breakfast service. Because the hotel is so well-located, I safely explored a different area of the city for a quick 30-minute walk each morning. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast at the hotel before beginning our busy tour days exploring Barcelona.
In the evenings, we enjoyed cocktails and delectable food at the Rooftop bar and restaurant - a must visit, even if you don't stay at the hotel due to the great views and stellar service. 
I would 100% stay at Serras again and recommend it to friends. I took off one star because we had an unfortunate incident where the shower randomly turned on for several hours while we were out, which made the room very damp... The manager offered to move us to another room, but we didn't want to go through the hassle (so that is on us), and they gave us complimentary cocktails and apps for the inconvenience which we appreciated. This small inconvenience isn't enough to dissuade me from staying there again though. We loved our experience and hope to be back some day!",4,2023,05,29
18,I expected more,I expected more from this hotel as we had paid a high rate. At check in they told us we hadn’t paid when we had paid upfront through an agent Mr and Mrs Smith. Our flight had already been delayed and we had been traveling a long time and needed to shower before our dinner plans that we were already late for. I felt the hotel should have dealt with it without us needing to be there. And they never actually communicated with us after that to apologize and say yes we had paid. We had to ask the staff. Then we asked the staff to book us a taxi a few days before by email for a concert we were attending. No taxi was booked. And it took us over 20 min to get one which wasn’t pleasant as we had worked out the time we wanted to be there. I know they worked hard getting us one at the time but it should have been a pre booking. We booked a junior suite but the seating area into the room made the hotel room small for a suite. The first night I was there it was really noisy. Not sure where the noise came from? I’m not usually such a moaner 🫣The rooftop is small. The rooms are well decorated and clean. And the hotel is in a nice position if that’s the area you want to stay in.,3,2023,05,29
18,Perfection!,"I second the rest of the reviews! This is an amazing hotel--one of the best I've ever stayed in. I've never met a group of more earnestly cheerful, the staff is incredibly helpful -- all of them. They anticipate your every need, and genuinely try to find that little thing that will make your experience just that much better. You just arrived from wherever... a cup of espresso? glass of cava? chocolates? I  felt like I was being taken into a lovely cocoon of comfort and service.  We found the rooftop bar a couple of years ago --it's one of the best, if you can't stay in the hotel, at least check out the rooftop bar.  We vowed to come back for a stay and we're so glad we did. Go for a meal in the rooftop restaurant, it's a great experience in itself.  I can't point to anything about the room, the hotel or the experience that I would change. it's incredibly well done, down to the details. Do yourself a favor, book a stay!",5,2023,05,22
18,The Serras is the place to be!,"The Serras Hotel in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter was a dream come true. The ambiance is exquisite, and the staff provides top-notch service. The hotel's location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter allows for easy access to iconic attractions and the lively atmosphere of the city. If you're looking for a memorable and luxurious experience, The Serras Hotel is the perfect choice. Shoutout to Diego, Pau, Raphael and Mei!",5,2023,05,22
18,Excellent Location and Service,"Serras Barcelona was exactly what I was looking for with our trip to Barcelona. A Boutique hotel in the perfect location - walkable to beaches and Gothic District. The service was excellent, the restaurant and rooftop bar were fantastic. Cannot say enough good things about this property.",5,2023,05,21
18,Best location and staff,"Everything about this hotel is perfect, including a central location, service from the front desk, staff, and the restaurant. I would definitely stay here again.  They were most helpful in orientating us to the city and places to eat and visit.",5,2023,05,12
18,Can't be beat,"An amazing property start to finish.  Excellent location and the staff are truly incredible.  The room was very comfortable and absolutely silent.  Almost unheard of in a city central location.  Give The Serras a try, you will not regret it.",5,2023,05,11
18,Super hotel in a great location,Lovely hotel without being ostentatious.  Staff were  welcoming and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and clean . Breakfast was great and dinner at Informal was also superb and well priced.  Ideal location for exploring Barcelona - more convenient than W or Arts hotels.  We will definitely stay here again if we return to the City.  Plus we loved the bed time cake treats!! ,5,2023,05,10
18,Fabulous Barcelona hotel,"A luxurious and chic boutique hotel ideally placed for a luxury break in Barcelona. The staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful at all times. Great breakfast each day and dinner in the restaurant was also excellent. 
 ",5,2023,05,06
18,Best customer service and amazing pillows,Sandra the breakfast manager is so kind and made me feel at home. She helped me get connected so I could work in peace. She knew my name and greeted me with a sweet smile every morning. The food is excellent and the nightly sweets are all yummy from someone who doesn’t eat sweets.,5,2023,05,02
18,Excellent experience,"It's impossible to disagree with all the other wonderful reviews.  While not a fancy hotel, it is definitely 5 star and we enjoyed our 5 night stay.  The staff is truly the best --- helpful, kind, knowledgeable and welcoming.  The breakfast is amazing.  Just be aware, one cannot keep the balcony doors open at night due to the noise.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2023,05,01
18,Perfection!,"One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had!  Every aspect was absolutely excellent, and most importantly the staff was very kind, helpful and genuine.  Loved it!  The location was perfect for walking and exploring.  We also loved the honey and the excellent coffee at the breakfast, the chocolate croissants were delicious!
",5,2023,04,26
18,Amazing,"We stayed at Serras to celebrate our wedding anniversary, after marrying in Barcelona the year before. 

I cannot say enough good things about Serras, from start to finish the service was incredible, rooms are amazing, fabulous central location, staff are so attentive and can’t do enough for guests. 

We had a meal one evening on the roof top which was delicious and definitely worth a reservation. 

We will definitely be back to Serras in the future !",5,2023,04,25
18,Outstanding 5 star Hotel,"This is an amazing hotel and as a frequent flyer i know when a hotel has figured it out! This is truly a 5 Star Hotel.

The Rooms: Extremely  quiet rooms, with double windows and we did not hear a thing and our room was near the front of the hotel. The bed is extremely comfortable, dark room drapes and all the amenities you need, complimentary water, snack at night, great lighting. Bathroom was huge, double sink, large walk in shower and everything was like new. rooms were perfect.

Food: breakfast was excellent and part of the rate. Rooftop restaurant was wonderful, great  food and great wine list. Rooftop bar was inviting and great vibe. Food, perfect.

Service: was top notch. With a small boutique hotel, they know you by name, and anything you need they will take care of it. Great restaurant recommendations and the best service I have had in a hotel.

They got everything correct with this hotel. Great rooms, food, service and location close to the beach, Gothic Quarter etc. If I could give it 6 stars I would. Well done!",5,2023,04,22
18,Best Hotel in Barcelona!!,"This hotel doesn't need my positive review, but I like to reward perfection.  Let's get the basics out of the way, at Serra all of the following are excellent (not just great or even amazing, but awesome!): location, decor, service, history and curbside appeal.  It may cost a little more, but well worth it!

Upon arrival the concierge were very accommodating.  Special shout out to Diego and Raphael for the exceptional service and genuine friendliness.  We arrived in the morning so our room wasn't ready, but they were both very helpful while we changed out of our plane clothes into walking around clothes.  Even Marjorie with housekeeping, who spoke only her native Spanish, went out of her away to assist with the European adapter/converter.   More help with the straight iron (don't ask).  And then when we forgot our sunglasses and hats, didn't blink an eye when we had to go back into our luggage one more time.  
The room itself was Top Top!  Love the hard wood floors.  Bed was super comfortable.  Double sinks. View was amazing.  And unlike other European hotels, the AC and heat both worked well.  
The breakfast buffet was the best I ever saw.  And thank you to all for the daily fill ups of ice into our Hydro Flasks.  On the last day, I finally noticed the ice cubes were just a little too big for the opening, so you had to put them in one at a time.  OMG!  
Every concierge took a better nightly photo of us in front of the hotel in our fancy clothes for dinner than the one before.  
It was a little cold to enjoy the rooftop bar, but our bartender (intern from the Netherlands) turned on the fireplace for us.  Words can't describe the lava chocolate cake, so I won't even try.

All in all, we've been to a lot of fancy boutique hotels, and this is the only one in the same category with an Aman.  The absolute best!",5,2023,04,17
18,Serras Barcelona is the BEST!!!,Absolutely spectacular hotel!!! One of the very best hotels that I have ever stayed in.  The location is perfect close to a lot of great restaurants and shopping.  The customer service was spectacular.  We really enjoyed the roof top restaurant.  The menu was fantastic.  The staff were extremely helpful and the rooms were very modern and quite.  My kids did not want to leave.  I would give this hotel an A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++,5,2023,04,17
18,Amazing hotel and service!,"This hotel is truly one of the best I have ever stayed in! From the moment we arrived everyone was so friendly and welcoming! The room was spotless, extremely quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. The rooftop bar is cozy and they have a nice fireplace and heaters for chilly nights! But the most amazing thing is that my husband believed he lost his phone at a restaurant/bar about 5 minutes from the hotel. We went back the next day but it was closed and we were leaving Barcelona. After a few days we heard the restaurant had his phone, and I contacted the hotel, and they were willing to go pick up his phone from the restaurant, bring it back to the Serras, and then kindly arranged for it to be shipped back to us in the USA. They were kind and so thoughtful and went above and beyond. I’m not sure many places would have done this. And we love the people of Barcelona, the fact that his phone wasn’t taken and the restaurant held onto the phone for several days was also amazing. We love the Serras and will be back there next time we visit Barcelona. Thank you!!",5,2023,04,17
18,Perfect 3 Night Stay,"We has a wonderful 3 night stay at Serras in early April. I originally booked a superior room, but changed our reservation to a grand deluxe shortly before our trip due to reports that superior rooms were on the small side. I'm glad I did as the superior room was the perfect size for the two of us. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom very spacious. We appreciated the little goodies left in the room in the evening. Every staff member provided top-notch service throughout our stay.

The location is perfect. It combines the best of both worlds by looking out toward the port while backing up to the Gothic Quarter. This makes for a very easy cab pick up/drop off when necessary although we walked almost everywhere. 

We enjoyed tapas and drinks on the rooftop, and had a delicious meal at Informal. I highly recommend Serras to anyone traveling to Barcelona!",5,2023,04,08
18,Best place to stay in Barcelona!,"We loved staying at this luxury boutique hotel! Great style, excellent service and an amazing location! The breakfast is wonderful and the rooftop restaurant outstanding. We loved the windows in the room that opened into the quaint street of the Barri Gotic.",5,2023,04,05
18,Family trip to Serras Barcelona,"Excellent hotel in a great location! The staff was wonderful- they were attentive, welcoming and very helpful! The rooftop was a nice place to eat, relax and watch the sunset. Will absolutely stay here again! ",5,2023,03,19
18,"Highly Recommend for Design, Location and Service",Beautiful boutique hotel in good location. Staff goes above and beyond. They reached out proactively to ask what they could do in advance of my arrival and arranged for both airport transfer and restaurant reservations. The breakfast is well done with good quality and selection. As importantly the staff at breakfast could not be friendlier or more efficient. I favor smaller boutique hotels that are well designed and provide quality service. Serras delivered. ,5,2023,03,16
18,A masterpiece of a boutique hotel,"Amazing location right on the promenade, round the corner from great restaurants, a Lichtenstein and the famous La Ramblas, Serras is located in the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona city. 
It’s staff is legendary: great service, who can provide expert help and great reservations. A special shout-out to Joao, who went beyond the call of duty to hail a taxi for us from the street in belting rain. And provided all manner of helpful advice. 
From the lovely welcome drinks, the Sunny lobby and the rooftop bar where Picasso’s first studio was, the Serras truly packs a huge punch in a boutique hotel
Package. Wont forget the nightly sweet collection or the feel of the place in a hurry. Highly recommended. Hope to be staying there next time I visit Gaudi’s city.",5,2023,03,06
18,"A quiet gem of modern,elegant coziness","This small little jewel of a hotel has been our Barcelona home for the past four nights. It is quiet, modern yet luxurious and cozy. 

Sandra, the breakfast manager, was a highlight of our stay. Her daily warmth, big smile and personal service made us feel at home. She knew our names, what we liked to eat, and anticipated our every whim. We felt so cared for.",5,2023,03,06

18,Excellent experience,"Hotel Serras is a boutique hotel with the very best service. It is simple elegance and comfortable. The service is excellent. We traditionally stay in five star hotels and this is up to all the standards we would expect. We stayed 6 days at this hotel and Barcelona and would come back again. Alex, who attends to the dining room is incredibly gracious and kind anticipating our every need. He exudes the essence of the hotel's warmth. Definitely recommend a stay at Hotel Serras.",5,2023,02,27

18,10 Stars! ,"I am a very picky traveler and this hotel is far and away one of the best I have ever taped in. The details of the rooms were amazing including a Dyson dryer and a straightening iron! Beds super comfortable and there is a pillow menu! The location is genius. Walking distance to everything and right at the harbor. Best of all is the service. Thank you to Alex, JiJi, Mauricio, Sara and everyone who works there! Sorry if I left anyone out. They all went above and beyond to take care of our every need. We felt like royalty.Don’t miss the rooftop terrace with its amazing food and great views. Hated to leave this hotel and can’t wait til we go back ",5,2023,02,10
18,"Old room furnishings, noisy road, great staff, great food.","Although this hotel is waterfront, I don’t think I would stay here again. The room furniture is really really old like from the 60s or something. It’s just cheaply furnished. Although I have to say the location is good as far as being near the old section of town, there’s got to be a better place. All in all I wasn’t really thrilled with Barcelona. I thought the old section had a lot of character found some cute shops. There’s like always small boutique shops, and then there’s all the main avenue of nothing but designer shops like as if you were in New York. Who needs that when you’re in Spain? One thing that’s really great is the staff. I have to say the staff is outstanding, and they knew I was unhappy with the room and they really tried hard to give me a better room. They were patient and very kind. The food at the hotel is good. And they had a cool bar up on the roof. I just really felt Third World. In the way it was furnished in the rooms. We did have a waterfront view. But the road is a main road and i noisey . I like to open my windows in a hotel, but it was too noisy to do that for very long. Again I have to say the staff is really good and the food was really good . If this stuff does not bother you go for it. Not worth the price in my opinion.",3,2023,02,08
18,Fabulous hotel,Hotel is well located and decor very nice.  Staff are amazing - friendly and helpful amd go out of there way to make you feel welcome.  Rooftop restaurant is great - food delicious and a wonderful view . Breakfast is nice but a bit pricey ,5,2023,02,07
18,FELT LIKE BEING WITH FAMILY!,This was THE BEST HOTEL EXPERIENCE I have ever experienced.  SONDRA THE BEST...and DIEGO (above  and beyond with a medical issue!) and JIJI and CARLOS. THANK YOU ALL!  The service and attention to detail was amazing.  After 1 week it felt like family and we were sad to leave.,5,2023,02,05
18,I would never consider any other hotel in Barcelona.,"From the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty. The staff are so friendly. The hotel is spotless. The bedrooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. The location right next to The Rambla and Gothic area is excellent. It was my second visit to The Serras and having experienced its superb service, I would never consider staying anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2023,01,29
18,Comfortable boutique hotel in a great location,"Serras is a great option for anyone looking to have a comfortable, well located hotel for experiencing all the sites Barcelona has to offer.

The location of the hotel makes puts many of the top attractions in the Gothic Quarter and El Born within comfortable walking distance. Likewise, there are an endless number of bars and restaurants directly around the hotel.

Service at Serras was great. From quick replies to pre-arrival questions, booking car service from the airport, check-in, to checkout, we were treated very well.

The room was about what you would expect for a centrally located hotel in Barcelona. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was large. Our room had a balcony that overlooked a side street.

We didn’t eat at the restaurant, though it was full of happy-looking customers every morning. We did get a chance to have a couple glasses of wine up on the rooftop patio, which was incredible.",5,2023,01,29
18,Great 5 star hotel!,"Great hotel! Rooms are spacious with every modern convenience. Rooftop restaurant is amazing. The rib eye paella was a insane. Great location at the beach. But the best part of our stay was meeting Sandra who runs breakfast downstairs. She is the employee every hotel should have. Friendly, helpful and willing to do anything to make your stay in Barcelona special. Thank you Sandra! We will be back. ",5,2023,01,21
18,Nick,"Highly recommended. A wonderful experience. Lovely staff, beautiful interiors and a fantastic location.
A short walk from both the marina and Las Ramblas made it so easy to get an immediate taste of this great city.",5,2023,01,18
18,Perfect spot for a wonderful stay!,"I stayed at the Serras on a work trip that I then extended through the weekend with my sister. The hotel was perfect for both groups - the hotel is located conveniently near the gothic quarter and the sea. The hotel staff is warm and helpful. The accommodations are clean, well equipped, and serviced daily with care.  The public spaces include the lower level restaurant, a second level lounge, and a rooftop bar/restaurant. All 3 are wonderful and provide excellent spaces for meeting as a group, working, relaxing, or dining. Speaking of dining… the Informal Restaurant is spectacular and the food was the best we had the entire weekend. I would highly recommend this hotel to any friends, family, or colleagues and will certainly stay here on my next visit to Barcelona!",5,2023,01,15
18,A gem of a small boutique hotel . Gets A+++,"Serras excels in service as well as hardware. Infact, on the service front it far exceeds expectations of even a seasoned traveller like I. 

Every person in the staff from the GM down to the housekeeping are simply great. They all get A in service excellence. However, Ji Ji and Sandra stand out in this front even more. Ji Ji gets A+ and Sandra A+++. Kudos to the management for instilling the sense of bespoke service excellence in all the staff.

The rooms are spacious and well laid out with large and efficient washrooms. The breakfast is nice and so is the restaurant - Informal.

All in all a great place to stay. Close to all the happening tourist spots but yet not in a crowded area.

No prizes of guessing where one shall stay in our next visit to Barcelona. Thank you all of you.",5,2023,01,15
18,A little slice of Heaven in Barcelona,"To say that the Serras was a great hotel experience would a huge understatement. Serras understands what true luxury is. It is about anticipating the needs of the guest before in advance. 

When first arriving after a long day of travel, we were greeted with hot towels to refresh along with chocolates and a lovely glass of Cava. The staff took the time to get to know us to better understand how they could assist. 

The rooms themselves were incredibly beautiful and well thought out. Instead of a bulky iron, they offer a steamer to quickly freshen your clothes. The bathrooms were large, the shower pressure amazing, and there was even a Nespresso machine and a tea kettle. The windows were two layers of double lanes windows with about a 10” gap between to keep out the city noise. The beds were pure heaven. 

The true gem of Serras, however, is the breakfast manager Sandra. From our first morning, she made us feel incredibly special. She gave us suggestions on where to eat and what to see. But beyond that, she made us feel like family. On our last day, she knew we had an early flight. So she arrived to work an hour early so she could make us coffee and she packed up a box of breakfast sandwhiches so we didn’t have to eat airport food. That is a level beyond good service. 

While Sandra was the star for us, the rest of the staff was also incredible and amazingly accommodating. I simply can not say enough wonderful things about this hotel. As for location, it is right beyond the Gothic Quarter which is a treasure to explore. And right out the front door is the Marina. It was perfectly situated to easily enjoy all that Barcelona has to offer. We also had the opportunity to meet Carla Serras who such a delight. The level of care and attention to detail is only achievable in such a small, family owned boutique hotel. Serras will be our Barcelona hotel from now on! Thank you all for an amazing week! It is now the standard we will hold other hotels up to.",5,2023,01,15
18,Perfect spot to enjoy the magic of Barcelona!,"From moment of booking until checkout - the experience was smooth, professional, extra-friendly. The property is small and very peaceful. Elegant design/layout. Room was quite large, with very comfortable bed/bedding, a full sofa, desk. Large bathroom area. Everything so clean. The staff make this an extra special place! SO helpful. Great food too. Wide variety of breakfast options. Lovely, romantic rooftop bar. And the Rooftop restaurant is a special place for an excellent, fine dining experience.
Location: Gothic Quarter, fronting the marina. Walkability 100%. Close to so many Barcelona highlights. And just a gorgeous are to walk around. Would love to return to this spot. Highly recommend!",5,2023,01,15
18,Incredible Service,"This was an incredible place to stay for our honeymoon. Right next to the gothic quarters, next to the water and just a short drive from amazing restaurants, we loved the room, the service and the staff. We'll be back!",5,2023,01,14
18,5 nights in Barcelona,"We liked the Serras Hotel very much. The location is ideal, you can quickly get to the old center of Barcelona but also to the port, Barcelonetta and the beach. The staff is very courteous, professional, very polite. The rooms are well equipped, the room service is good. The Roof top restaurant, the small bar and the view over the harbor is very nice. Sandra and the breakfast team are very attentive and do a very good job. We will be back again!
",5,2023,01,13
18,Best hotel experience ,"5 star hotel with 10 star service! The entire staff is fabulous and has hospitality mastered. We were greeted upon check in by the manager who treated us to Cava and chocolates and hot towels to refresh us after our long journey from Arizona. Our room was fabulous and packed with amenities. Great view and quiet surroundings. The next day we had breakfast at the hotel’s restaurant. Sandra, the breakfast manager treated us like family and became our best friend in Barcelona. The food was cooked to perfection and was only surpassed by Sandra’s impeccable service. We couldn’t dream of staying anywhere else. ",5,2023,01,10
18,Ultimate Luxury,"We loved our experience at The Serras. The staff was friendly, polished & professional. The hotel itself is beautiful. The beds were luxurious and comfortable. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast during our stay. The rooftop bar was chic & cozy. The location is great and convenient to so many things. We had an issue with our shower and the staff was super quick to switch us to another room (which was an upgrade, and much appreciated). They were very apologetic but we didn't mind the shower issue at all. Overall, Serras is an amazing boutique experience... you won't leave disappointed!",5,2023,01,08
18,Special boutique property in Barcelona!,"This is a lovely boutique hotel in Barcelona where the rooms are stylish, the service is excellent, and the staff is knowledgeable and so friendly. The breakfast was incredible, starting with the way Sandra greeted us, completely remembered exactly how we took our coffee and what kind of eggs we liked, and then, truly rising above, delivered to my wife a bottle of the amazing olive oil they had served to take home! She stood out among a staff that was already incredible. Highly recommend this special property.",5,2023,01,07
18,Wonderful 5 ***** hotel,Enjoyed my stay. Excellent service. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Food was superior quality.  Can't wait to return. I highly recommend this hotel. My only minor complaint was the toilet paper could be softer.  ,5,2023,01,05
18,A great visit,"Serras is one of the best hotels we have EVER stayed at.  The location is great, right near the Port and walkable to virtually EVERYTHING. 

It is easy to see that a lot of time and thought was put in to all of the design elements of the Serras. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious and highly functional. The decor is modern and clean without being trendy. 

The breakfast in the restaurant was delicious. 

We had New Years Eve Dinner in the restaurant and it was not only delicious and fun, the staff went above and beyond to accommodate our daughters food allergies. 

This was a continual theme at Serras. Everyone we encountered was knowledgeable, helpful, and happy to do what ever was needed. Smiles abounded. 

Even after hosting a long New Years Eve party on the roof top (fun and a great location)  the staff was in great spirits on New Years day. 

Kudos to all.

We look forward to staying with you again. ",5,2023,01,05
18,exceptional service with an ideal location,The service and aesthetics of this boutique hotel were exceptional. The guest service team provided exceptional recommendations for dining and helped make reservations along with handling logistics. Very fast to respond as well,5,2023,01,03
18,Amazing staff and facilities,"The best experience we have ever had, the staff were amazing we have never had such excellent service. The room was fantastic, the room service amazing, the location could not have been any better! Highly recommend Serras Hotel as the best experience for your accomodation. Thank you to all the wonderful staff you made our holiday very special.",5,2022,12,28
18,Excellent experience,"The hotel has exceptional staff who are very knowledgeable and very friendly. The food is excellent and the Christmas meals were excellent.
This is our favourite hotel in Barcelona and we look forward to our next visit ",5,2022,12,28
18,Exemplary,"This is perhaps the best boutique hotel I’ve ever stayed at. From the moment we arrived the warm, accommodating staff made us feel welcome and pampered, and while all of the staff members were amazing, one person in particular made us feel at home in Barcelona.  

Sandra, the manager of the Informal Restaurant was a wealth of knowledge and helped us navigate the local attraction and restaurant scene with aplomb.  Yes, the food and service in her restaurant were also excellent, but it was such a delight to have her recommendations for our six night stay in Barcelona.  

I wish that I remembered everyone’s names to be able to mention them here as well, alas I cannot.  

If you’re looking for an exemplary boutique hotel in the perfect location to experience everything that Barcelona has to offer while being made to feel as though you’re the most important guest in the hotel, Serras is it.  

Thank you for such a lovely stay. ",5,2022,12,27
18,Exquisite experience,"This hotel certainly delivers and goes beyond its already highly notable reviews. I could go on and on here about the quality of the rooms and about the kind and personable professionalism of the staff; however, all that has already been written and published — it’s all true! Who deserves a distinctive mention is Sandra, the Breakfast Manager at the hotel. 

Sandra, right from the start, proved to be a special person, who made our trip to Barcelona particularly wonderful. She was always genuine and helpful. As the days of our stay went on, she became our go-to person, who graciously guided us to all the best of Barcelona. We looked forward to seeing her each morning because she is a mind reader, who magically seemed to anticipate everything we needed! Dare I say we made a friend, and that is one of the best memories of our trip!",5,2022,12,27
18,Boutique luxury hotel,"Serras Hotel was amazing! We received a warm welcome when we arrived. The staff was incredibly helpful and always friendly. The breakfast at the hotel is delicious. We loved the fun rooftop bar and the incredible restaurant (with a Michelin chef!). You can’t beat the location, across from the Mediterranean Sea and in the Gothic Quarter. We will recommend Serras to all of our friends! ",5,2022,12,27
18,Definitely overrated. Do not overexpect. Be warned.,"We came to this place with high expectations especially after it has been rated among top tree 5 star hotels in Barcelona. We actually left with very average impression and let me tell you why:
-Hotel is located facing extremely busy street which is not seen on their pictures and even the small side streets around are very noisy too. Hotel is not far but not exactly close to many of city attractions neither located right in the port. 
-Neither hotel room is quiet enough (we tried several) and some are also very dark considering side streets are very narrow. Neither room is large enough as well, even higher categories rooms are actually very small.
-Hotel is kept well but far from being new and shiny - broken glass in elevator, fading wall painting etc, equipment failures (we've had hot water coming from both taps all of a sudden, which has been fixed by technician in a way that hot water was coming from cold tap and vice versa)
-Staff has very limited capacity and any even minor request require them to ask management which takes time. All issues are handled very slow (like it took them 45 min to handle request to change our rooms or just provide late departure-just one hour later took them almost 40 min). Staff tend to say no to most of the request and you have to be persistent. 
-Small open rooftop bar that get's cold in winter (no other place for your evening drink). Restaurant was not really occupied during our stay (all other city restaurants were very busy!) and has limited selection for breakfast (almost no buffet at all). I was very surprised to know they use Nespresso capsules for coffee and do not even have a proper coffee machine which is a shame. 
Overall and unfortunately I really cannot recommend this hotel.",3,2022,12,26
18,Serras,"What a wonderful boutique hotel in a great location.

But the truly special thing about the hotel were the staff. I stay in a lot of hotels for business and pleasure. The staff at the Serras were as good as any I have experienced. Professional, attentive and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,12,23
18,Beautiful Hotel in an Excellent Location,"We stayed two nights on our way back from Mallorca and cannot say enough good things about this hotel.  The staff go out of the their way to help, the beds were comfortable, the location is ideal for walking just about anywhere and just several blocks from a Metro station.  We ate at the Informal restaurant and WOW just WOW... the food even for this vegetarian was amazing!  Value for the price can't be beat!!!!  Oh and it was our anniversary and they left a bottle of wine with our names and ""Happy 22nd Anniversary"" label on it in the room :-)",5,2022,12,23
18,A truly great hotel in Barcelona,"From the moment we entered the hotel, we were greeted warmly by the staff. The room was beautiful and quiet until the last night when we heard an extremely loud event on the rooftop bar that ended at midnight.  The night manager was very apologetic for the noise but I would suggest that management reconsider having DJs who blast music that reverberate three floors down. The rooms are not soundproof. The quality of the hotel is very high but one cannot justify paying those rates  and hearing that level of noise. It is not fair to the guest.

On another note, Sandra, the breakfast manager, was a standout as she welcomed us every day for breakfast and had excellent recommendations for local experiences and restaurants.

All in all, a memorable visit to Barcelona.",4,2022,12,19
18,Wonderful stay Serras Barcelona,"We have just had a lovely three night stay at the Serras from check in to check out could not have been better, lovely room and wonderful service
Especially from Sandra at Breakfast and Clara
We will be back ",5,2022,12,19
18,Luxurious yet warm and welcoming,"BEFORE I arrived at the Hotel Serras I was already experiencing the Serras warmth--I was welcomed at the airport by a very attentive driver named Jorge. The drive to the hotel was filled with history about Spain and his own personal story.  Upon arrival I immediately felt the warmth of not only the gorgeous naturally sun lit lobby with wood floors and high ceilings, but by the welcome of the staff who knew me by name and who were awaiting my arrival.  This hotel was a welcome change from the ""Miami"" template look and feel of so many hotels that are all marble and monochrome white, where you don't even know what city or country you are in. This hotel is a small boutique hotel and the warmth exudes not only  from the architectural environment but is embodied by the staff.  Diego checked me in and accommodated my request for a room with a tub and high floor. I arrived with a handwritten welcome note from the operations manager Clara and bottle of Cava. My room was a corner room with a divided nook for work or reading with the main room overlooking the Gothic streets with twists and turns that I could watch people below from my two small balonies. This hotel was the first studio of Picasso's! The hotel literature captures a story of him throwing things at passersby below! Everything in the room was functional and designed with intention. The light was where it should be for reading. There was a sophisticated Jaccuzzi tub (with instructions), well placed outlets and plugs, a clothing steamer, and a yoga mat! That evening I enjoyed a rooftop drink and not wanting to leave the cozy fire that the staff had made for me, I had dinner served where I was sitting next to the fire from the Michelin rated restaurant. The Carpaccio was divine! And paired well with the wine that was recommended to me by the very knowledgeable restaurant manager, Alejandro (Alex). In the morning I was greeted by an exceedingly warm restaurant manager, Sandra.  I wrote her a note thanking her when I left and said, that Americans are friendly, but people from Spain, are warm as demonstrated by her words and actions. She took the time to really listen and be present. She asked about my travels, my dogs, directed me to a dog store for presents for them (in addition to the Picasso Museum), cautioned me when it might rain and to carry an umbrella, all while organizing my special requests for English tea (in a pot...), and an egg white omelette (for which I asked the recipe).  The buffet was sumptuous with breads, cheeses, Iberian ham and always fresh juices and fruits. This was my last stop on an around the world business trip, and the last hotel in my travels and I would say that this hotel is in a class of it's own. Luxurious yet welcoming.",5,2022,12,18
18,Lovely stay,I chose this hotel based on the reviews and they were spot on. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Ideal location to the Gothic area and many restaurants.Our room had a beautiful view of the water. We will return and stay again.,5,2022,12,16
18,Very nice hotel and very good staff,"We stayed for 4 nights in the Serras hotel and it's a very nice place to stay in Barcelona. The staff is very friendly, the breakfast is very good and the rooms very comfortable. A nice rooftop bar! And parking is very easy. ",5,2022,12,12
18,"Great location, world class service!","We love The Serras for many reasons. Most important is the staff. Most competent, very helpful, always friendly. Peerless. Location and style are wonderful too. Beautiful rooms. Great breakfast. Just a few steps away from El Born and the marina. ",5,2022,12,09
18,"Excellent Service, lovely room","Last November 17th, we arrived for a two night stay at the Serras hotel in Barcelona. Having experienced, and enjoyed, Barcelona before, this was a shorter pre-cruise visit. Our travel agent recommended the Serras as a smaller, boutique hotel that we would enjoy. 

It was after 9PM when we arrived. As soon as the cab had off-loaded our luggage, did two gentlemen from the hotel literally run out to grab our suitcases and usher us inside. There, we were directed to comfortable chairs, offered a glass of cava and chocolates, and had the most civilized check-in experience that I ever have had in all my years of business and leisure travel. 

Once formalities accomplished, the concierge showed us the breakfast area, and the roof-top bar and dining area. Then, we were escorted to our grand deluxe room. It was just great: a room with a small sofa and a chair; fine for the two of us. The bellman even brought an extra cart for our luggage, which could be stored off to the side (as we were going on a cruise we had two suitcases each). The room was well temperature controlled, quiet, so, later on, we slept like logs. 

It was by now about 10PM, just the right time to dine in Barcelona. Rather than walk about at night not knowing where to go, we went up to the top floor terrace restaurant which is highly rated, and it did not disappoint. Excellent service and very good food--for dinner that night and also for the next day at lunch. The pool bar was also pleasant. The included breakfast was fine for our purposes, as well--this is served downstairs in a nice bright room with helpful servers. 

On departure, the helpful and friendly concierges arranged a larger van for us to get to the cruise port. They had also, for our second night, recommended a nice local restaurant for dinner after we did the ""pedrera"" tour. 

This boutique hotel was really excellent. We don't mind paying but then we expect value. The Serras delivered excellent value. We will return next time we are fortunate enough to be back to Barcelona.",5,2022,12,08
18,The best,"Absolutely exceptional customer service, helpful staff. The food was incredible as well, honestly some of the best food I had in Barcelona. Whenever I needed something, the staff was available and happy to help. Delightful and welcoming experience. Thank you. ",5,2022,12,07

18,They are #1 for a reason ,"If we are privileged to return to Barcelona again, we will definitely try to stay here. They have every amenity you can think of, and some you hadn't thought of.  The staff is so friendly and accommodating. The rooftop bar and restaurant is beautiful and the food was delicious. Also the location is great. Our only regret is that we only had 1 night.",5,2022,11,30
18,Wonderful Place to Stay and Special KUDOS to Sandra Bellet,"The hotel front lobby staff were so friendly and attentive from always opening the door for us and so helpful and kind to questions we had from the outlining area to getting a taxi. The most significant experience I had was a woman named Sandra Bellet who was the waitress at the bottom level restaurant. Not only was she extremely kind, friendly, approachable, and so attentive she memorized my order, and every morning would know when I would come down for breakfast and would already have the order placed! so I didn't have to wait. She was so approachable and would talk with us and help us with all our questions about the area, airport, and the Spanish food and culture. Sandra made such an impression on us that we are planning on going back to see her, since now have befriended her. Thank you ",5,2022,11,28
18,"Review of Serras Hotel and Staff, Barcelona Spain","This boutique-style hotel and staff were fantastic! It is located perfectly on the waterfront and is just a short walk to the marina, the ocean, and the gothic district with so many historic sights to see. 

The staff was very nice and so accommodating. I would like to mention one outstanding staff member specifically. Sandra B, the morning restaurant manager, was the most attentive, accommodating, and just a joy to be around. She really made our trip special. Her attention to detail and service was exemplary! The food was amazing too. 5 stars for her and the hotel! ",5,2022,11,28
18,Greta Garbo in the Gothic Quarter,"Glamorous and gorgeous, a hideaway in the Gothic area of Barcelona not to be missed.   From the moment I entered the hotel I felt taken care of with an understated attention and with unquestioned quality. Diago could not have been more helpful and understanding.  Sandra was amazing, gracious & responsive. The highlight of my stay was lunch on the roof top restaurant. The cuisine prepared with seasonal and local produce was scrumptious. The service impeccable. Thank you for an experience I would love to repeat. ",5,2022,11,19

We had a private guide who commented he had never been treated so nicely.  A wonderful rooftop bar and fabulous restaurant. We would return to Barcelona just to stay here.",5,2022,10,28
18,I've been home for 6 weeks  from a 3 week trip that began in Barcelona. Serras  was the best part of a 6 co. trip!,"Cara and her family have created an oasis that is worth a visit on its own! I'd been to Barcelona before, but this was an exceptional experience. I would go back to Barcelona just for the Serras Barcelona!  The welcoming accommodating staff, the superb facility, the food! Everything was exceptional.  Including dinner at the Rooftop Restaurant as the sun set.  If my schedule includes Barcelona, it will include Serras Barcelona.",5,2022,10,04
18,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"The property was modern, clean and beautiful. The entire staff was ready to serve and exceeded any expectations we had. Sandra, the breakfast manager became family! Claudia, at the front desk was more accommodating than any hotel employee I’ve ever encountered. If you want an amazing experience from service to food and room and amenities don’t hesitate and stay at Serras.",5,2022,09,29
18,Superb!,First rate in every respect!  Superb staff!!!  The staff was extremely friendly and took great care of my every need.  The location is excellent.  The rooms are excellent.  The food is also excellent.  Superb service!!,5,2022,09,27
18,Beautiful!,"Fantastic boutique hotel with a wonderful staff, restaurant and amenities.  Location was perfect to enjoy the marina, historic district and culture.  We don't often recommend a place, but this one 5 star plus!",5,2022,09,25
18,A Memorable Stay,"I picked this hotel for its location. All within easy walking distance is the beach, gothic quarter, Picasso museum, tapas bars galore. Everything else is a 10-12 euro taxi ride. The hotel is wonderful, clean, comfortable beds, good food in the restaurants. What really sets this hotel above the rest is the staff. They are simply the nicest, friendliest folks you can find.
",5,2022,09,25
18,Outstanding Stay,Highly recommend this hotel. The location is fantastic and the customer service is of the highest quality. The rooftop bar and restaurant are outstanding and added bonuses. There is nothing that they could have done to make our stay more enjoyable.,5,2022,09,24
18,11 out of 10 stars!,"We were guided to the boutique Hotel Serras from our travel agent.  The only drawback is we only had two nights at the property.  Hotel Serras has an unbeatable location of being close to the beach, walking distance to Picasso museum and La Rambla is minutes away, just to name a few.  The rooftop bar is delightful after a full day of sight seeing. The restaurant is an absolute treat as well.  It is a beautiful hotel, but what makes it most spectacular is the staff.  Everyone is graciously helpful and willing to help with any request.  Our admiration continues with the wonderful and most accommodating Laura at the front desk.  Laura shines at Hotel Serras and we feel lucky to have had the experience of meeting her while staying at this fantastic property.  We can highly recommend you book here at any opportunity.  We will surely be back to enjoy Hotel Serras again.",5,2022,09,23
18,Rating of Serras - provided us with a great launching pads  to explore Barcelona! The service was available everytime.,Barcelona was a great city to see and explore. We we warned about pickpockets everywhere we went. We had been here 25 years ago & so happy to have had a chance to visit it again. It has grown up very well.It wasn’t the progress made on the Guity church but the visit to his apartment building that I was sooo excited to see.,5,2022,09,22
18,Superb.,"The superlatives are warranted. Beautiful decor, attentive and warm service, lovely and well thought out (quiet!) spacious rooms, with design flair. Perfect location in old quarter. Just a superb place to stay. ",5,2022,09,22
18,A hidden gem,"This is a very nice boutique hotel in a great location. It has all the amenities you would expect in a five star hotel but what really sets it apart from other properties is the staff. Without exception, we found every employee to be friendly, attentive and extremely helpful. They genuinely seek to make your stay as enjoyable as possible and they succeed in doing so.",5,2022,09,21
18,Simply the Best,"I will not stay anywhere else when visiting Barcelona. Excellent location, amazing service and amenities. The rooms are large, clean and impeccable. The staff is extremely attentive and very engaging and wonderful. ",5,2022,09,21
18,BEST,"one of the best place i've visited . good place, factastic customer service and the food there was really outstanding. The staff was always around us ready to help us at anytime we want. And the breakfast was really tempting",5,2022,09,21
18,Fantastic Boutique Hotel,"The hotel was ideally situated in the Old Town area of Barcelona, near the waterfront.  A well laid out hotel with tasteful artwork all around.  The room was very spacious with a very comfortable bed.  The staff at the hotel were terrific.  Friendly and attentive to your needs.  Highly recommended!",5,2022,09,20
18,"Outstanding Service, Great Location","Service is really outstanding and welcoming across all functions I engaged in the hotel.  Breakfast has a solid offering, not exaggerated but sufficient. General crowd in the hotel seemed very pleasant, no noisy families with small kids etc. isolation from outside noise is great (keep in mind it's Barcelona and bars in the alleys tend to draw crowds that make noise. but hotel generally has good noise isolation). This is a boutique hotel, so facilities are proportionate to its category (i.e. pool is really just a dipping pool and dining area is ""cozy"") but that's a boutique hotel and that's how it should be. don't expect a resort-type facility. rooms are very well kept and clean, with daily room service and turn down service. location is absolute best adjacent to the Gothic quarter, close to all tourist attractions, 10-15 min walk to the beaches. they have an arrangement with the public parking across the street and also provide valet is needed. I wouldn't even look for any other hotel in Barcelona. this is the place to be (if you're into boutique-type hotel)",5,2022,09,19
18,Most amazing attentive staff we have ever experienced!,DOn't know how they do it but the staff is always around trying to help without being annoying.  Other hotels need to bottle this because it's the best staff any of us has ever experienced!  The rooms are small but exquisite.  CAn't recommend this place enough!,5,2022,09,17
18,Chic hotel with stellar customer service and location,"Wonderful stay! We arrived exhausted after 23 hours of travel and we were warmly welcomed by outstanding staff who offered us cava, coffee and snacks while we sat in the lovely lobby for check in. The room was beautifully appointed and chic and the bed was very comfortable and made up beautifully with crisp sheets. We also enjoyed the lovely view on the rooftop deck - don’t miss it. We walked a short distance to las ramblas for shopping and delicious tapas at bar canate. 
Thanks to Esther, Carla & Sara for wonderful, friendly service with genuine smiles and true hospitality.",5,2022,09,15
18,First Class Service,"We enjoyed a luxurious stay with Hotel Serras.  The staff was incredibly accommodating in service and recommendations.  The location is very good, the rooftop restaurant is outstanding and the somm there is spot on with her suggestions.",5,2022,09,13
18,Such a find in the middle of a bustling city,"From the moment we exited our taxi, we were greeted by porters to help with our luggage. The check in process was unlike any I've experienced before. Towels to clean our hands. Chocolates and wine followed. We were given a complimentary upgrade and the room did not disappoint. And what a treat to have a phone to take with us for navigation. The rooftop is beautiful and a great spot to decompress from all the walking and touring in the city. Customer service is top notch. I would definitely return should I find myself in Barcelona again. ",5,2022,09,11
18,Amazing stay! Incredible staff!,"The Serras draws us back to Barcelona every year.  As soon as we entered the hotel lobby we were greeted with the utmost warmth from the staff.  At check in we were offered a glass of cava, chocolates, and a hot cloth. They have an attention to detail rarely seen in other hotels.  
After check-in, our first stop is to The Serras rooftop for some of the best jamón ibérico in the city.  The rooftop offers a spectacular view of the marina and across to Barceloneta. The Serras location offers an easy walk to restaurants and all the sights.   We look forward to our next visit.
",5,2022,09,11
18,Another great stay ing Barcelona,"We have stayed here a few times and loved it every time! The welcome is out of this world, from door opened by Hotel Manager, wet towels, chocolates, cava. What a first impression. We love Barca with this Hotel making our stay. Beautiful modern surroundings, fantastic location, great terrace with pool and super cocktails! Rooms not massive but so clean! Working trip last time but heading out again soon. Can’t wait!!",5,2022,09,11
18,Great boutique hotel,Awesome hotel. They made us feel special from the moment we arrived.   Lovely staff. Well appointed room with very comfortable bed.  Plenty of special touches. Highly recommended. We will definitely return. ,5,2022,09,11
18,The 5 Star Reviews were right!,"What an amazing hotel, one of my favorites.  Just got back from great trip.  After long plane flight from LA, we were greeted with a welcoming glass of Cava and some of the best service ever.  The room was lovely, with a ginormous rainshower (and we just booked the deluxe room).  Although our room was on the front, the double-glazed windows were perfectly soundproofed.  And breakfast...Sandra the breakfast manager was so sweet and lovely, it was a pleasure seeing her smiling face. Everyone was helpful and friendly and couldn't be more accommodating.  And the food...breakfasts were lovely and the rooftop restaurant was such a perfect beginning to our trip, we ended our stay with a lunch there as well.  Location was perfect as we could walk almost everywhere (not the Sagrada Familia).   Highly, highly recommend!",5,2022,09,10
18,What a great experience,"From the moment our car pulled up to the hotel we knew that this place was special. The staff are incredible and can't do enough for you. The hotel was spotless. The roof top bar and restaurant are delightful. Our only regret was we did not stay longer. If you want to be treated like a star, this is the place for you.",5,2022,09,08
18,Can’t imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona,The location was perfect. Walking to everywhere - La Rambla and Bouqeria; Barceloneta; Picasso Museum; so much else. Staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. Rooftop bar and plunge pool overlooking Port Vell were perfect along with dinner at Informal. Look no further for a memorable experience!!,5,2022,09,03
18,Best customer service!,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels in many cities and this by far is THE best in terms of how accommodating the staff were. From our initial arrival, where we received refreshing towelettes with drinks and chocolate to opening the door for us every time we entered and left the building. Everyone was very helpful. We had a little snag with our timing in terms of not being able to check in until later that afternoon but is to be expected with a boutique hotel and limited number of rooms. The location was a little away from all the hustle and bustle but also close to the port in case you want to walk over to the beach. Overall, I would consider staying here again, for sure.  ",4,2022,08,30
18,If you want the Best,"I reviewed many properties before deciding on Serras.  It was on the higher end price wise, but we could not have beenhappier with our two stays there, before the cruise and post cruise.  The property is located next to the Marina and is in outstanding condition.  The shower is the BEST.  The restaurant is Amazing.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  We had some missed flight problems and I simply made a call to them, and they fixed it, no issues.  Wonderful staff and a jot to stay at.",5,2022,08,25
18,Fantastic vacation,"Apartmens in this hotel is amazing.
The rooms are equipped comfortable beds,georgious interior.
This hotel has all inclusive,but i dont recommend overeating because your belly will swell.
The staff of this hotel are helpful and accommodating.",5,2022,08,24
18,Excellent hotel,"This was not only a great location (close to Barri Gotic, El Born, Barceloneta, the beach, La Rambla, etc. and one of the main train station for trips outside the city) from which to visit Barcelona, but the hotel personnel was really helpful and friendly and sympathetic at all times.   The food is great both at the plunge pool bar and the restaurant.  I was initially worried that my room on the second floor facing the street would be noisy but on the contrary no noise could be heard.  Overall a 12 nights in a super little boutique hotel that was  a great experience for the 4 of us that I highly recommend! ",5,2022,08,23
18,Excellent in Every Way,"From check in through departure, every part of our stay was terrific: great staff, beautiful room, wonderful rooftop, delicious breakfast-- I could go on and on. When we return to Barcelona, Serras Hotel will be our home again.",5,2022,08,23
18,Fantastic Stay,"My Husband and I stayed for only 1 night as a stopover before we flew back home.  I wish we could have stayed longer, the hotel is great, but the staff are what makes it exceptional.  The rooftop for dinner was great with very good food and a good wine list and a knowledgeable sommelier. The lactation was why I stayed there as its within easy walking to the main shopping and eating areas. ",5,2022,08,20
18,Much more than expected......,"This is a lovely ""adult"" property.....sophisticated but casual and very friendly. Clean and modern in an excellent location overlooking the marina area.  The rooftop restaurant and bar area is very welcoming and they go out of their way to make it both fun and a high quality experience.   Staff is very helpful and attentive...... in an intelligent way.  Creative and excellent food.  I don't normally feel comfortable making recommendations, but I'll stand by this one!",5,2022,08,20
18,We could not have been happier,"My wife and I just did a 10 day trip to Spain and had this slated for 3 days and right after we got there we added another day. The location is wonderful for walking all over town and we did just that. Stopping all over the place to eat, drink, shop and see art including the Picasso Museum. If you are doing a cruise from that port nearby it is a wonderful place to stay prior or after as well (we didn't do a cruise). The staff was literally the best ever! Special shout out to Antonio, Diego, Ona and Sandra at Informal which is the restaurant on the lower level. By the way they also have a Michele Star restaurant on the roof top too.
If you are considering staying in Barcelona and looking for a place I could not give this place a higher mark! 
I could go on for hours about these people and this place but I don't want to bore you. Any questions please message me.",5,2022,08,19
18,Amazing hotel,"I can't thank the staff enough - the Serras is amazing - the service is excellent, the hotel beautiful. 
We felt truly spoilt and looked after. The hotel oozes luxury, but the staff are warm, kind and approachable. 
Sandra, the breakfast manager, was so lovely and did an excellent job. She's a real asset to the hotel and a wonderful person.
Ona also made us feel very special",5,2022,08,18
18,Excellent food and staff,"One of the best experience my family has had in a while - the food was excellent and stuff friendly and extremely helpful, and an extra star on top for Sandra for serving a smile and good humour along with a great breakfast.

I will be back with my family again just for the experience.",5,2022,08,13
18,Don’t miss this hotel if you are going to Barcelona!,"This is simply the best boutique hotel - with only 28 rooms an designed like a high end private club, one cannot go wrong. The service is particularly noteworthy as they offer completely personalized interactions and tailor the experience per guest.  I stayed with my husband and two daughters for 4 nights. The rooms were perfectly appointed, modern, and warm.  The entire hotel feels more like an upscale private apartment with great common areas like the second floor lounge/bar and the rooftop pool/ lounge/ restaurant. It is a little slice of heaven in the heart of Barcelona- perfectly located in walking distance to prime areas.  The staff were consistently accommodating to any of our needs including picky food eaters, restaurant suggestions, transportation, etc.  While I could go on for a bit complimenting each staff member as they are all quite exceptional, I specifically found the daily breakfast manager, Sandra, to go above and beyond to ensure our days started with a great plan. Thank you Hotel Serras, I will be back and will definitely recommend to friends and colleagues.",5,2022,08,13
18,Barcelona Stay,"Amazing customer service. Everyone was extremely genuine and very helpful. My husband worked with the staff to coordinate a surprise trip and sunset cruise for my birthday, it was perfect! Location was amazing with tapas bars in each direction and the water across the street.",5,2022,08,12
18,"Amazing Staff, Wonderful Location, Great Room","We recently stayed at Serras for our honeymoon trip to Barcelona. We arrived a few hours before check in, but were greeted with cappuccinos and espressos, bottled water, and a place to store our luggage. Sara B, from the concierge desk, spent lots of time with us, pointing out local destinations on a map, helping with restaurant reservations, and making suggestions for short day-trips. She even followed up with an email to remind us of the places we had discussed. The service is what sets this hotel apart! From the attention received at the rooftop pool to the turn-down service in the evenings, and the friendliness of calling taxis and holding open the front door. We were blown away with all of the attention to detail. Our one complaint is that we wished our room had a Smart TV to be able to stream shows, but honestly, we wouldn't have used it very often during this trip anyways! Each room gets a smart phone with internet, data and phone access that you can carry with you throughout the city - something that came in handy, as our phones had eSIMs and were unable to make calls in Spain (we were having trouble finding a tour group we were meeting up with and needed to call the guide!). We're already talking about returning to Serras for future trips to Barcelona - highly recommend this hotel! ",5,2022,08,09
18,Charming Boutique Hotel,"This is a nice boutique hotel that pays a great deal of attention to detail. The aesthetics are lovely with nice furnishings and decor. The staff is impeccable-very helpful, kind and responsive and might I add good looking! The location is great because it’s right in the gothic quarter and also on the port side for easy access. Our room was pretty compact. It was a Grand Deluxe room and we were crowded in with three. Also unless you’re facing the front, the views are onto a tiny street so you’re looking right into the building across the alley and you feel closed in. Finally, the rooftop is charming with nice port views but please don’t expect a real pool. It’s more of a plunge with a few nice sun beds. Lastly, the breakfast is delicious in a lovely ground floor restaurant. Enjoy!",4,2022,08,09
18,Best Service I Have Ever Received From A Hotel,"A quick note since I don't post often - The Serras Barcelona is simply fantastic.  I travel a lot, I've been to 62 countries, I do about 100-120 hotel nights per year.  I have never received service at a hotel like I did at the Serras, ever.  From check-in to check-out, it was the most service oriented staff I have ever encountered in a hotel.",5,2022,08,08
18,Just wow,"What a fantastic hotel. The location is perfect to explore the city whilst also being an oasis of relaxation. 
Even though you're city centre the rooms are so well insulated that there is virtually no noise so we all got a great rest.
Every team member that we engaged with were just exceptional - so genuinely warm & friendly.
The rooftop terrace is so heavenly you could sit there all day eating tapas & drinking cava and be very happy in life!
Can't wait to go back!",5,2022,08,05
18,A Gem of a Hotel,"The staff were attentive from the minute we got out the taxi, cold towels given, glass of bubbles or coffee, chocolate and a smile. Could not ask for more. The food and wine was exquisite from the Rooftop Restaurant.",5,2022,07,31
18,A Gem in Barcelona,We had a terrific stay at the Serras Hotel in Barcelona. It is a beautiful property with a very convenient location. What makes this place so very special was the level of service. It was truly amazing!  We arrived well before check-in but were given a very thorough discussion of sites to see in the city along with a map and notes. Diego was fantastic! Gracias Diego!!  The rooms are well appointed but small. The rooftop has a small soaking pool and a terrace bar. We had a truly enjoyable time staying at the Serras.,5,2022,07,30
18,The Swanson's,"What a great hotel! We would stay here again in a hart beat! great location and the staff was amazing !!
No only negative comment we would make is we had to leave (LOL).  The hotel rooms were clean and quite.  The staff were eager to help with any questions or needs. The location was perfect for getting anywhere in the city.
",5,2022,07,29
18,Exceptional stay!!,"Everything about my stay was perfect!  Lovely people, fab food, funky rooftop, super clean, and had a great vibe!  The staff are so friendly, and were there to help with everything.   Location is the best in the whole city!",5,2022,07,26
18,Stay at Serras Hotel,"We are back at the Serras Hotel in lovely Barcelona, since Covid stoped the world. 
It has been pleasure to be back. A beautiful hotel with top class staff in all departments.
To always be welcomed at any time of the day is really nice. 
The breakfest with Sara and her staff is a nice way to start the day. Our family really injoyed the top roof with the bar, pool and restaurant.
We can really recomend a stay at the Serras Hotel for anyone.
Kind regards 
Morten",5,2022,07,24
18,Three night stay,Our family of three really enjoyed our stay at Las Serras. The location is great/ the gothic quarter/ Barceloneta and ramblas areas are in the immediate area. The staff was very caring and hard working to exceed our expectations. The arrival was unlike any other hotel we have stayed at and the dinner we had at Informal (their rooftop restaurant) was great!,5,2022,07,22
18,Exceeded expectations,"The Serras is understated but elegant.   Decor is minimal but comfortable, often not achievable.   The staff is friendly and professional.   We will be back again and recommend to friends looking for a memorable experience while in Barcelona.",5,2022,07,21
18,A spectacular hotel with an even better staff,"The hotel is lovely, but what makes the Serras special is the staff.  They were the most engaging, friendly and helpful staff that we have ever encountered.  They were helpful without being intrusive, and so very friendly that you easily felt that you could ask for advice from anyone on site.  That said Sandra and Maria were particularly aware of preferences, and always attempting to find something that they could do to help (if you coughed immediately a glass of water appeared, and so on, and so on).  If you have the opportunity stay here, we certainly will.  ",5,2022,07,19
18,Best birthday treat ever!,Amazing hotel . Amazing staff. We went there for my husbands birthday. They called in advanced to get his name and prepare a little surprise in the room . Have been spoiled rotten the whole time. Rooms are amazing. The terrace is beautiful and the staff are just the best! I am a local and have never experienced such an amazing customer service. 10/10!,5,2022,07,17
18,Sublime Serras,"Truly Serrastic - This may be the first time i have scored 5 stars across all categories. From the location, to the building interior design and cleanliness; right through to the truly magnificent staff and talented chef’s. It’s hard to see why one would stay anywhere else.",5,2022,07,17
18,Jenny Australia,"Stunning Hotel with exceptional service and very Friendly staff
Modern beautiful decor 
Great rooms with very comfortable beds
Absolutely amazing roof top bar, pool and restaurant 
Fantastic food and atmosphere 
Highly recommend and will definitely return ",5,2022,07,16
18,GOOD ONE!,It was a great trip here. We had a wonderful time and we are planning another trip in 2023.  It was really a memorable experience. We enjoyed the food and the staff was great. It was overall a very good exprerience.,4,2022,07,15
18,Great boutique hotel!,"We stayed at the Serras for our mid year holiday. What an experience!
Everything from the check-in to the room to the food to the check-out was amazing!
We travelled with our 9 month old daughter and the hotel couldn't do enough for us. They supplied a crib and baby bath as well as specific hotel-made teddy bears,
Highly highly recommended!!",5,2022,07,13
18,Nothing short of perfection,The whole team are so accommodating. The hotel is central and boutique like. The food is fabulous and the rooms are so nice. The hotel is very clean. The staff make you feel special Thanks again and we will be back!,5,2022,07,12
18,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"Great location, chic hotel and amazingly helpful gorgeous staff. The staff really made the experience brilliant. Lovely, small roof top area but well sorted with a small plunge pool. The roof top restaurant served excellent, quality food with great service. Small, functional gym.",5,2022,07,05
18,Amazing anniversary celebration stay!,"We stayed for 8 nights in the Junior Suite with the marina view, and every aspect of our stay was amazing: the room, the location, the staff, the food - it was all first rate. From the moment we entered the hotel we felt cared for: from the special bottle of cava waiting for us with a special happy anniversary label, to the turn down service with a fresh bottle of water and sweet treat each night, a box of sweets and a note from Anastasiya, helpful recommendations for meals, help with taxis and tickets - anything we needed they cheerfully helped us. We send a special shout out to Sandra who not only made our breakfast experience each day delightful, but she took the time to help us find a flower store and wine store to buy gifts for some local friends. As a family owned business, it is clear that the hotel guests are cared of us family, too. We will definitely be back for future stays.",5,2022,07,02
18,Another wonderful stay !,"We returned to the Serras hotel and were greeted like old friends. 
Sandra had hugs for us and we were so happy to see her. She and staff do a wonderful job. Our breakfast was delightful. Drinks at rooftop were excellent, loved the Cava Sangria! 
Sadly we had to say our good byes to Sandra and staff, but we will certainly return .",5,2022,06,29
18,"Welcoming, friendly, helpful and luxurious",My husband and I just returned from Barcelona yesterday! What an amazing city! The Hotel Serras was in a great location with easy walkability to lots of restaurants and site seeing.   The Hotel staff went above and beyond in every aspect of our stay. Our bags arrived late and they called the airline for us to track them down.  They washed our clothes as our bags hadn't arrived and did them overnight to accomodate us.  They made restaurant suggestions and reservations for us.  My husbands birthday was while we were staying there and we were surprised with a lovely cake and Happy birthday wishes as well as a bottle of Cava!  I sincerely hope we have the opportunity to stay at this lovely hotel again!,5,2022,06,28
18,One of the very best places I have ever stayed,"I’ve stayed in hundreds of hotels and Serras is among the nicest eat stays I have ever enjoyed. What distinguishes this hotel is the graciousness and warmth of the service. The rooms are lovely, well sound proofed, and deliciously cool. The gym is small and entirely functional. The roof top pool and restaurant are great escapes from the busyness below. The food is very good. The location is great. And the service is as good as it gets. Everyone we met there made us feel at home and we’ll cared for with their generous, authentic approach. Sandra in particular was a delight at all our breakfasts. She’s an incredible ambassador for the hotel and Spanish hospitality in general. Brava!",5,2022,06,26
18,Beautiful hotel and wonderful experience — a Barcelona must!,"We had an amazing experience staying at Serras and would highly recommend the hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona looking for luxurious and comfortable accommodations accompanied by gracious service. 

Upon check in, we were greeted with cool towels, chocolates, and champagne and juice. The staff was warm and welcoming, and quickly showed us to our rooms. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable, and had lovely balconies and views. Of particular note, Serras is located on a busy street, but the sound insulation is magnificent — one evening fireworks were going off til 1 am, and you would hardly have known. It’s blissfully quiet in the rooms. 

The Serras staff was especially kind and attentive. In particular, Sandra, the breakfast manager, was warm and welcoming, and remembered our names and our coffee orders. She even chatted with me in Spanish once I told her I’ve been learning (even though we’re a family of English speakers!) She certainly made our stay that much more pleasant. Plus, she knows the hotel and the city inside and out, and provided lovely recommendations. 

Overall — Serras is an amazing hotel and a wonderful place to vacation. Plus, it’s in a great location, and just a short walk from parks, beautiful plazas, shopping, and restaurants! I couldn’t recommend Serras more.",5,2022,06,26
18,"Lovely hotel, gracious service","We loved our stay at The Serras - comfortable (and well sound-proofed) modern design rooms, helpful and gracious staff, especially we enjoyed Sandra’s smiling, warm and attentive help and conversation…she was delightful! Delicious food and a lovely roof deck patio restaurant. Highly recommend and will definitely visit again!",5,2022,06,26
18,Wonderful People,"We loved our stay at Serras. The people made us feel at home and treated us like family. Everyone was kind, but Sandra made the visit especially special for our children. We can’t wait for a return visit!",5,2022,06,24
18,Wonderful,Our second time at this gem. I am almost hesitant to add to all the glowing reviews lest the secret gets out. Really a special place. The rooftop is so relaxing and an ideal place to experience the amazing 22:30 sunsets (with amazing cocktails of course).   From the moment you check in until you sadly check out everything is just charming and comfortable (you will love the beds)!!,5,2022,06,16
18,Absolutely superb,"A wonderful hotel with fantastic staff. From the minute you walk in you feel special. Greeted with ice cold cava and lots of smiles. Lots of lovely bedside treats throughout the stay.  Quiet and peaceful rooftop with plunge pool. Loved it all. Would highly recommend. 
Beautiful restaurant on top floor. We only had one meal there and it wasn’t to the same standard as the rest of this gorgeous little gem. 
Incidentally there is an amazing little brunch restaurant called Milk around the corner which is outstanding. Well worth the wait for a seat!! 
Thanks to everyone at the Serras!",5,2022,06,14

Every staff member we encountered provided excellent service. Several staff members made the stay extra special: Betsy who greeted us upon arrival, and Sandra who made sure breakfast was perfect.

18,Location and exceptional staff will have you at hello.,"Great location near the Port Vell and nothing but smiles and great service from the moment you arrive, from the greeting to the restaurant staff. Exceptional service is only one of the many adjectives to describe this property. You are always asked if you need anything and if more can be provided. Dinner at Informal on the rooftop had a beautiful ambiance. I cannot say enough about Sandra in the restaurant. Daily breakfast was a treat when she greeted you with smiles and remembered how you ordered your coffee. When someone takes the time, not only to provide exceptional, five star service, but to remember ambiance’s and details of the hotels guest, they should be mentioned and acknowledged. It had been quite sometime since I had a restaurant service manager treat me with such detail. Kudos to Sandra at the restaurant and Sara at the front desk for going above and beyond the call of duty and making our stay so pleasant and memorable. Five stars for Hotel Serras for a great property and for hiring the finest staff in Barcelona. I can’t say enough about this place. You will enjoy every moment. Thank you, Hotel Serras!",5,2022,05,17

18,"WONDERFUL, LUXURY BOUTIQUE HOTEL","We stayed at the Serras Hotel for five nights in May, and this hotel is truly what all boutique hotels should strive to be. The property is well-appointed, the location is perfect, the food is excellent and the atmosphere is wonderful. But most importantly, the service is absolutely flawless. And I’d like to specifically shout out a couple of superstars. First, Sandra who oversaw the morning restaurant operations with a perfect balance of efficiency and warmth. She made us feel welcomed and appreciated from the moment we stepped into her kingdom. (Breakfast was not included in our rate but we made a point to eat at the hotel every morning primarily because of her). And another super shoutout to Ona, the General Manager of the hotel, who takes a gracious and inviting relationship with her guests. After a hiccup with the air conditioning system at the hotel, Ona and her team did everything in their power to make us comfortable. She was the perfect example of what a Hotel General Manager should be, and truly went the extra mile for her guests - including personally calling in a couple of reservations for us when it would have been impossible for us to make them on our own. And she’s just incredibly gracious and likeable to boot which radiates into her whole team at the hotel.

The bottom line is that truly great hotels are not only beautiful, well-appointed and well-located, but are run and staffed by professionals who take personal responsibility for your experience. And they love doing it. This hotel is the real deal. Bravo, team Serras.",5,2022,05,15
18,Fabulous Serras hotel,"So we love the hotel, great room, great location!!!

18,Contemporary boutique hotel with breathtaking views,"Stylish, modern boutique hotel with character.  The views from the rooftop terrace are panoramic and amazing.

Rooms and bathrooms decorated in contemporary tones plus quality extras e.g. Nespresso coffee maker and hair straighteners !",5,2022,05,06
18,Absolutely Superb Serras the best of the best ❤️,"Chosen for its location, chosen for its reviews, chosen for its style but what you can’t choose is such a wonderful welcome. 

We have only been staying here one night so far and already we are delighted. 
Never have we stayed in a hotel that has welcomed us in such a fabulous way. 
We arrived early so ate in the roof top restaurant, it was absolutely delicious, don’t miss it out because quite frankly I had the best best omelette I have ever had topped with baby squid cooked to perfection. Of course the staff here were a pure delight to. We really do know because not only am I (#baldchefnick) studying at one of the uk’s top professional chef schools but we have been lucky enough to eat at some very highly rated Michelin star restaurants including Disfrutar last night.

Our double aspect room overlooking the marina is both stylish and stunning, and we received a lovely note from the general manager and personalised bottle of cava and sweet nibbles.

We are here for 5 nights but I felt it very important to review now while we are here. We are indeed lucky to be here.

I congratulate all that work here from the management down.Each person for me so important in making this uniquely special hotel fabulous.",5,2022,05,06

18,Great location; great service,"Located steps from the Gotic Quarter, this hotel is intimate enough to provide what feels like personal service for each guest.  Our room, located on the second floor near the front of the hotel, was spacious, well appointed and spotless.  Notwithstanding that we were in the front of the hotel facing a busy street, we did not hear much noise.   We really appreciated the staff, especially Sergio.  We were welcomed warmly and given an informative introduction to the hotel (something that many hotels fail to do these days).  Service at the rooftop bar, the restaurant for dinner and the breakfast was attentive and friendly.",5,2022,05,03
18,"Lovely, I would have given top marks if only.....","This is a truly lovely hotel; the staff are friendly and kind, everything is clean and the rooms and social spaces fairly well maintained, especially considering we are coming out of C-19 with the drawbacks that this meant to the hospitality sector. I would have very happily given them top marks if I had more than 2 hours sleep at night...... there is something in their electricity system that doesn't quite work and at night lights come on and go off with all the switches ""clicking"" - on the last night there is happened non-stop every couple of minutes for approx 4 hours, so I left without a wink of sleep. 
I would like to think it was a temporary glitch and give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Oh, a mention goes to the restaurant - although half empty and with zero atmosphere, it has a lovely view of the port and the food is very very good!!!!",4,2022,05,02
18,Outstanding place to stay,Felt like staying with friends.  The rooms very comfortable the staff extremely helpful. They even prepared an off the menu item for our dinner.  Dining on the roof top during a rainstorm was a delight. ,5,2022,04,29

Everyone on this team embodies the senior managements ethos- customer service and smiles. We have kids who can be moody like kids are. But at the this hotel we were made to feel special and cared for. A special mention for all 4 gentleman who valeted our car. They are super efficient and friendly. Also Sandra at the breakfast, Anastasiya at the front desk and the GM are just amazing people.",5,2022,04,26
18,Truly made us feel at home!,"Serras hotel situated at the best possible
 location in Barcelona with sea view offers a truly impeccable service to every single customer even to my 2 year-old.  The hotel decor is very stylish and the building used to house an old Picasso studio so it’s definitely not your ordinary 5 star hotel!  Every staff had a warm smile and made us feel at home.  One special staff we really enjoyed meeting every day was Sandra at the restaurant.  Our kids loved her and she was very caring and attentive.  One cool feature of the room was very easy-to-understand shower system.  Even at most of the 5 star hotels, the nozzle can be complicated and we have to figure out first and explain to our children but here at Serras the rain or regular shower had buttons so very easy to understand and use for our kids.  The hotel really cared each detailed based on customers point of view.  We would definitely come back.",5,2022,04,24

18,City Break,"A fabulous hotel in a wonderful location - the staff are so friendly and helpful and made up feel very special.

We especially liked the hand held PA that we could use outside the hotel - it connected to the mobile network allowing us use on line maps, recommendations for walks that were programmed in and call the hotel (a great innovation).",5,2022,04,22
18,Serras Barcelona,"Our experience at Serras was nothing less than fantastic! The location, decor, food, drink, and rooms were spectacular but the best parts were the staff and the overall attention to detail. From the moment we walked in until the time we left, the staff was attentive, helpful, and made us feel at home. They seemed to take real pride in their work and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Thank you for all of the little details that made our stay so special - the special cava welcome, the nightly bedside treats, the help with reservations (and allergies!) - it was a vacation we will always treasure.

18,Extraordinary Hotel Experience and Staff,"My family and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Serras. I can honestly say that we have never had a better experience at any hotel. The hotel and rooms are beautiful down to the smallest detail. Every person on the staff, behind the desk, the concierges, and in the restaurant is extraordinary. They go beyond being professional and friendly. They made every interaction truly personal and joyful. Each recommendation they gave us for a restaurant was absolutely perfect for what we wanted each night, whether fancy, casual, entertaining, or a particular type of meal. Even for things that would otherwise be a hassle such as renting a car or getting a covid test, they ensured were easy and excellent with service coming to the hotel on our schedule.

18,Amazing experience at the Serras!,"Our experience at the Serras was incredible from the moment we arrived until we (sadly) departed.  We got to the hotel after 20 hours of travel, and were greeted by genuinely friendly and lovely staff, who escorted us in (with umbrellas to protect us from the drizzle), handed us glasses of champagne and house made chocolate, gave us a brief tour of the property and led us to our elegant and extremely comfortable room.  Evening turn down service was a delight, each night with a different small homemade bite-sized treat left for us to enjoy.

Every time we came and went from the hotel we were greeted warmly, and made to feel at home in the cozy public areas of the hotel.  The rooftop bar is lovely (weather did not permit us to spend enough time there!) and restaurant was delicious.  Our favorite part of the stay was morning coffee and pastries, served by the most lovely Sandra, who we enjoyed chatting with each day and who anticipated our every need and made us feel like family.

18,Can we please rate this hotel 6 stars?,"In decades of travel, this is the best boutique hotel we have ever stayed at. 

When staying at a five star hotel, your expectations are for well-renovated rooms, good quality beds, pillows to your taste, turn down service, easy check in and amenities that make you feel comfortable.  

This hotel has all of the above. 

What differentiates Serras from other five star hotels is that they have a front desk who truly cares about guests. We arrived from a taxi in the rain (management ran out and greeted us with an umbrella), And how about arriving early after a flight and the (closed) kitchen prepares you a coffee and brings you pastries…just because.  How about an outstanding and top tier restaurant with friendly and easy going servers who make your dinner delicious, delightful and fun? And finally: how about a hotel who knows you’re leaving early for a flight and packs you a delicious breakfast remembering your dietary needs? That’s a special place!

We would like to recognize the entire staff of Serras, they deliver a truly exceptional hotel experience.  We would like to specifically give the highest honours to Sandra and Juan (hope the name is spelled right).  Thank you for making our visit so special. 

It is very easy to say that “we will be back”, and in all our reviews we have never said that…until now!  And we have already recommended the hotel to friends and family passing through Barcelona. 

Bravo and gracias Hotel Serras!!!",5,2022,03,14

18,Enjoyable!,"Located close to the port (with nice views from some of the rooms) and in walking distance to the Rambla, the Serras is the perfect place for an extended week-end stay in Barcelona.

If you want to enjoy a relaxed stay, this could be the right fit for you. ",5,2022,03,09
18,Can't fault this hotel! Breakfast Manager Sandra and Margova were amazing!,"The Serras Hotel is a cut above. ALL staff were just great, and we were lucky enough to have the very lovely Sandra taking our breakfast orders each morning. She went out of her way to help us in every way she could, going over and above her role as Breakfast Manager. It was mostly Margova in reception who booked us taxis and tickets and made great restaurant recommendations. She also went out of her way to make our stay enjoyable, for instance coming to our room to adjust the temperature. The room and bed were very comfortable. The chambermaids were friendly and came in twice a day to check towels and give us a treat next to the bed in the evening, which was a really nice touch!

18,Wonderful small hotel with exceptional staff,"I do not give perfect scores lightly, but after multiple stays over several years, I believe The Serras to be one of, if not the, best hotel I have ever stayed at. What sets it apart from other luxury hotels, is how every single member of the staff, with no exceptions, was impeccably service-minded and had an effortless familiarity that made us feel truly welcome and appreciated, from the moment we arrived to the second we departed. 

Apart from this, everything else expected from a luxury hotel was delivered. The hotel is perfectly located with many of Barcelona’s high points in comfortable walking distance, the restaurant was excellent (the breakfast as well), and the rooms were large and comfortable. The hotel is of course not cheap, but given the quality down to every detail, it really is great value for money. 

There is no doubt in my mind that we will be returning to The Serras on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2022,02,06
18,Simply stunning,"What a fabulous place. There's genuinely nothing we could fault about our stay here. It was perfectly located for us, close to the Ramblas and the sea and although on a main road, the room was silent! The service here is absolutely faultless. Nothing is too much trouble. Very comfortable beds, fabulous breakfast, beautiful roof terrace, help with reservations and recommendations. It was simoly perfect in every way. ",5,2022,02,02
18,Best place to stay in Barcelona,"We really appreciate the service of the Serras Hotel. Beside the amazing RoofTop with outstanding food, the amazing Service and accommodation, we especially enjoyed the personal service.
Thanks for the wonderfull stay, we will see us again!",5,2022,01,25
18,Feel like home,"A very special place where you feel like home, very professional, helpful, competent and friendly staff giving a great service and very comfortable atmosphere, delicious food, cocktails, of course wonderful location ",5,2022,01,21
18,"Beautiful, friendly, 5 star luxury.","Stunning hotel. 
Location is perfect between the beach and La Rambla. So many restaurants and bars nearby. 

Staff were amazing - so friendly, so helpful! 

Informal restaurant was delicious. 

Very child friendly too! such a beautiful boutique hotel, exceptionally thoughtful. ",5,2022,01,19
18,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in the Heart of every thing.,"The location is great, in the middle of Born, and a 10 min walk to the beach.  The rooms are fantastic, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. It's definitely going to be my go to hotel for my future Barcelona getaways.",5,2022,01,18
18,Beautiful and Clean Hotel with Impeccable Service! You will regret not staying here!!,"I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and I must admit, there is a reason why this hotel is #1 in Barcelona:

1. Hotel/Rooms: Conveniently located, new hotel with exceptionally comfortable beds and extremely clean rooms. Rooms are larger and more functional than most rooms in Europe.

2. Restaurant and Rooftop Bar: Breakfast was fabulous with very kind people always helpful, food and drinks at the rooftop were superb especially after a day of touring and New Eve's Year. There's nothing like enjoying a nice glass of wine and watching the sunset over the Balearic Sea.

3. Service: This is where Serras truly shines! Upon check-in I was upset because I wanted a higher floor. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication between the hotel and my travel agent. However, both Marjorie and Sarah handled the situation extremely well -- they were empathetic and provided several solutions. In the end, we stayed on the 2nd floor which ended up being a beautiful suite. The staff goes out of their way to make the guests very comfortable and happy. The restaurant recommendations were excellent because they were where locals ate and not the typical tourist traps. From the front desk to servers at breakfast, dinner, and rooftop to the amazing bellman (especially Sergio!), everyone truly cared about your experience there.

Thank you again for such a memorable time in Barcelona!",5,2022,01,10
18,Best Hotel in Barcelona!,"We can't say enough about how much we loved Hotel Serras! Truly one of the very best hotels we have ever visited in our lifetime of travels. The hotel is chic and comfortable, well located and convenient. The staff is super friendly and helpful, and the food/beverage is as good as it can get... our family's meal at Informal was unanimously the best meal we have ever had... sounds like a bold statement but completely true! We can't recommend this hotel enough, and we will definitely stay there on our next trip to Barcelona.",5,2022,01,10
18,Just Amazing!,Serras Barcelona goes way beyond to make you feel special. The staff is so friendly. The rooftop is so special and very good bartenders! We loved every minute at this hotel!

18,A wonderful experience always,The Serras is my favourite Hotel in Barcelona.

I would highly recommend the Hotel to anyone coming fo Barcelona. ,5,2022,01,03
18,Great Stay over the Holidays,"Wonderful boutique hotel.  From start to finish, first class experience.  Location of hotel is great as it is in the Gothic area, but stradles El Born and easily walkable to almost every aspect of Barcelona.  ",5,2022,01,01

18,Perfect weeekend with Family.,We were staying here with big Family and friends. Celebrating anniversary at the roof top! Everything was great! Freandly stuff. The only thing have to mantiene that it was a bit hit at the corridor and at the day of check out  the electricity disappeared and it caused some inconvenience. ,5,2021,12,08
18,Outstanding Service and Hospitality!!,"Serras Barcelona is an excellent hotel, their entire staff worked hard to make our visit a success and very enjoyable!!

18,Number One for a Reason!,"My wife and I travel often and have stayed in many great hotels. The Serras is definitely at the top of the list! The hotel management is impeccable as they payed attention to every detail of our stay. Above and beyond every day we were there! Sandra was the perfect first human encounter each morning in the restaurant for breakfast. One of the friendliest people we’ve met! Barcelona is an amazing city with so many things to see and do, but on out last day of our trip, we just relaxed around the hotel. It’s extremely cozy, with the rooftop lounge and the library bar. The service is top notch and ended up being one of the best parts of the trip. When we come back to Barcelona we will only stay at the Serras!",5,2021,12,03
18,Great Stay,This hotel was perfect for our stay. It was located near everything we wanted to do. Everything from check in to check out was seamless. Sandra the breakfast manager was wonderful. She greeted us each morning and already knew what we may want to have! Would recommend.,5,2021,12,02
18,Absolute perfection!,"We had a lovely stay from arrival to departure. Top class service, beautiful hotel and gorgeous food. Thank you to all the staff we met during our short stay, you made our anniversary and birthday celebrations very special! We will be back again!",5,2021,12,01
18,Incredible boutique hotel in unbeatable location with fantastic staff and great rooms,"We absolutely LOVED our week-long stay at the Serras - it started from the second we stepped foot in the hotel - we were given a warm welcome by the knowledgeable and friendly staff complete with champagne, OJ, water, warm washcloths and a thorough overview of the property and its offerings.  The beautiful yet understated decor and different areas to lounge, enjoy time with each other and dine/have cocktails were simply marvelous - the view from the rooftop deck is hard to beat, along with the cozy seating arrangements both on the rooftop, and in the library.  We also really enjoyed our dinner at Informal, the on-site restaurant - it was so very tasty.  The breakfasts we also enjoyed - particularly  the personal and caring touch of the waitstaff (most especially Sandra) had for our family - she knew our 'regular' order, especially the gluten-free bread for our daughter.  She was very pleasant and fun to talk to, and always prompt with our orders.  

Our rooms were nicely-sized - the beds along with the bedding and pillows were SOOOO comfortable, we had a hard time getting out of bed in the mornings.  Loved the small touches of slippers and thick robes, very large and absorbent bath towels, a flat iron (!), special treats at turndown every night and the large rain showerhead.  The staff was consistently AMAZING - everyone bent over backwards to help us, spoil us, make sure we wanted for nothing.  Multiple times during the week, the wonderful doormen would get us coffee, water and croissants to go; the incredibly knowledgeable front desk/concierge/reception team did everything from arrange meals for us, brought me tea at 6am in the library when I couldn't sleep, helped us order taxis, got us covid tests on site at the hotel, checked in with us on how our daily adventures had been - they all took amazing care of virtually everything we needed.  The location of the hotel cannot be beat - it is walkable to essentially everything you would want to visit while in Barcelona - 10-20 min walk to anything.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat!!",5,2021,11,28
18,i’m gunna miss this place a lot,"it was so fun. the food was amazing and the service was amazing. they always got out of their seat to open the door for us. all of the staff was so nice and kept up with all of our needs. sandra the breakfast manager was literally my spirit animal i’m gunna miss her funny stories. i highly suggest talking with the staff because they are so fun.

18,Very good hotel with excellent staff,"Serras Hotel is very good hotel in Barcelona with excellent location (next to the Gothic Quarter, on the waterfront, near the port) and with hospitable staff. Very quiet rooms where you can sleep well.",5,2021,11,23
18,Excellent hospitality,"First of all, the location of the hotel is incredible. Everything is in walking distance. As soon as we made the reservation, they contacted us and asked about our special requests. The receptionists told us what to do and where to go on the map at the check in, and this made our job much easier. Our room was very clean and comfortable. If we come again to Barcelona, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2021,11,23
18,Truly Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed 7 nights at the Serras.  They treated us like family. They were so patient, kind and attentive to our every need.  It was so sad to say goodbye and we plan to return as soon as possible.  The Serras really enhanced our overall experience of Barcelona.",5,2021,11,22
18,November in Barcelona,"Everything was great! The hotel is beautiful and staff really friendly. The rooms are great and very comfortable. It was my second stay in the hotel. We are looking forward visiting it again, as soon as possible. ",5,2021,11,22
18,Excellent Excellent Excellent Hotel with superb staff and service,"Serras Hotel is understated elegance with undoubtedly a 5+ Star delivery of service in every aspect. I can’t recommend this hotel enough. I don’t want to leave! The staff who I want to publicly commend, who I interacted with the most, are Juan, Sarah, and Marguba. In addition the rooftop bar staff. They are all very professional, warm, and helpful. The rooftop bar is not to be missed. Definitely book at Serras!",5,2021,11,22
18,Three days in heaven,"Perfect location. AmazIng staff. Helpful, friendly and a delight to interact with each day.  Fantastic breakfasts each morning. Sandra knew our orders after day one and made each morning a special event. The hotel is clean, the rooms big enough and the amenities on point.",5,2021,11,21
18,The ultimate in relaxation and service!,"We cannot speak highly enough about the staff at the Serras. Our first foreign trip since the start of the pandemic, we were both excited but also uncertain about how things worked. On walking through the main doors of this beautiful hotel, all worries and concerns fell away. Friendly is just not strong enough for describing everyone at the Serras - we were genuinely and warmly welcomed, and there was nothing that was any trouble for them.  We were offered very thoughtful recommendation for restaurant and other venues, and they even managed to secure a last minute table on our final night at a great place (Berbena) even though it really was fully booked!

We were given a fabulous corner room on the 3rd floor - so stylish but also well-appointed with all we needed.  They provide a mobile with internet access to use as a map (along with very necessary umbrellas) for all our excursions through the city. Their location is prefect, walkable into the Gothic Quarter, the trendy bars and restaurants in El Born, and opposite the old port.

Breakfast was top rate - with again such helpful and friendly service - and we are already missing the unbelievably good bread.

In the evenings, the guys on the roof terrace went to extra lengths to make us comfortable and offered a great selection of wines to try.

All in all this was a great trip, made even better by our stay at the Serras and we look forward to the next time.",5,2021,11,19
18,Beautiful hotel,"Great hotel in a very central location on Passeig de Colom. Beautiful roof terrace with a small pool and space to relax as well as a bar for cocktails and snacks. I particularly liked the staff attentiveness, I was contacted a few days before our stay to ask if there was anything the hotel could help us with. A very nice touch. Rooms are modern and very clean and comfortable and quiet. ",5,2021,11,19
18,"WOW, do not hesitate to stay here!","We stayed here for only one night before a cruise - and actually wish we could stay longer.  The service, attention to detail, communication, unique building and rooms, and location was very special and totally enjoyable.  The rooms even come with a cell phone you can use!

We, also had lunch on rooftop, and breakfast on 1st floor - both very good, nice ambience, excellent service and quality etc.  

Finally walking distance to so much, shopping  & bars/restaurants - let alone a short cab to the cruise terminal.

Cannot think of a reason not to stay there for anyone, and, we will definitely stay here next time we come to Barc.",5,2021,11,17
18,Excellent,"We had a wonderful stay, everything was top notch: the room, the hospitality, the service. Your personnel was very friendly and helpful. And a special mention for the chef and the food in your rooftop restaurant. All in all, we'll be back.",5,2021,11,16
18,Outstanding service and hospitality!,"The service and hospitality at the hotel was exceptional.  They never hesitated to go that extra mile to truly make our stay all the more pleasurable. 
The rooms are a bit on the tight side but extremely accommodating with all the luxuries for a comfortable enjoyable stay.",5,2021,11,16
18,Wonderful Place To Stay!,"We arrived in Barcelona later in the evening.  From the moment the front door was opened and we were welcomed to the hotel, we felt special!  The staff at the front desk was friendly, new our names, opened the door for us and helped with reservations.  The roof top bar and restaurant staff was so friendly and the food/drinks were terrific!  A special shout out to Alejandro, the mixologist behind the bar!  He was so kind and made everyone who ordered a drink feel like a friend!  We also loved the waitress who took care of the breakfast tables.  She was so friendly and prompt.    Concerning the rooms, comfortable beds, great shower and relatively large compared to other Spain hotel rooms.  Thanks for a fabulous stay!",5,2021,11,15

18,Wonderful service & beautiful hotel,"We have just spent a fantastic moment at the Serras hotel. The hotel is very well built and decorated. If you are looking for a luxury boutique hotel in Barcelona this is the place to go. Super service at all levels. Special thanks to Sandra (magic breakfast and service), Clara and Andrea. Perfect location, beautiful rooms. Thank you.",5,2021,11,05
18,Best service ever!,"Amazing hotel! Great food, top location, great view to the harbor, fantastic bed, I loved it here. I was personally welcomed by the owner, did not have this in any other hotel I stayed in.  I can really recommend this hotel for your stay in Barcelona.",5,2021,11,05

18,A top notch experience at the comfortable boutique hotel,"Fantastic from arrival to departure. Our junior suite was very comfortable and clean. The location is perfect for all that Barcelona offers. Most importantly the staff is AMAZING. Every team member we encountered was friendly, gracious and helpful. Most amazing was Sandra in the restaurant. Always smiling and friendly, super accommodating to all our needs. We will most certainly be back!",5,2021,10,31

Great food at the rooftop. We always love the breakfast and the service of the breakfastmanager Sandra. We already look forward to coma again!",5,2021,10,27
18,If you want to feel totally pampered!,"This is a terrific oasis ideally located close to the waterfront with easy access to many of the key venues within the city.  The Born is just behind the hotel with its amazing labyrinth of alleys.

Don't miss the dinner upstairs.  Food and service were outstanding. 

What really makes the hotel stand out however in addition to lovely accommodations is the extraordinary attention to detail of the front office team.  We felt very welcome and taken care of in the most personal way.  This is without a doubt a 5-star experience and I would recommend it highly as a home away from home  in this fascinating city.",5,2021,10,27
18,Fantastic hotel,"This is a lovely hotel located in a great section of town with walkability to most attractions.  The staff could not be more attentive!!  We had the lowest room category which was quite small but even so very, very comfortable.",5,2021,10,26

Plus points debs diner debs & liz are fantastic food and drinks spot on one of the reasons I return so many times",5,2021,10,16
18,"Beautiful hotel, but their service sets the bar for others","We stayed at Serras Hotel for 5 nights and had  a fantastic experience there.  We've travelled extensively, and I can't think of another hotel that so clearly distinguishes itself with it's level of service.  The people who work there are consistently warm, responsive, personable and committed.  We especially appreciated our interactions with Sandra, the breakfast manager, and Clara the operations manager.  We felt like we made friends with them while there.   Can't recommend this hotel highly enough!  And by the way, their rooftop pool, lounge and restaurant is fantastic.",5,2021,10,14
18,Service you can’t find elsewhere-thank you Sandra,"PROS-this hotel is great overall.  The location is convenient to many attractions, great food and beach walks.  Staff went above & beyond to help and get you anything you need. 
CONS-uncomfortable beds
SERVICE- I would visit this hotel or ANY HOTEL, over and over again, if Sandra (who works in the breakfast dining & the rooftop lunch area) was there.  I have stayed at hundreds of hotels and never in my life have felt as special and well taken care of Sandra made me feel.  She truly cares and seems to know what you need and want and had the most amazing way to put a huge smile on your face, even when you’re completely her lagged with a half day time difference.  

The rest of the staff were kind, thoughtful and helpful.  They wanted to make you feel at home,  help you get to know their city and even help you book massages etc-but you could sometimes tell they were ‘doing the job expected’.

If Sandra was to train the staff on how she’s able to make your visit unforgettable-you’d never be able to get a room as the place would be booked out for months.  I can’t wait to go back-even with hard beds.",4,2021,10,10
18,1 Staff Member Made Our Experience Amazing,"Sandra who works in the breakfast restaurant made our experience so personal and lovely. She is authentic, warm genuinely cares about her guests. Not only is she attentive, but she learns what guests like and delivers. While the rest of the staff was nice and helpful, Sandra rose above her colleague to create a visit for us that will be a cherished memory for a lifetime. 
I have worked in customer service for more than 30 years and Sandra exudes all of the characteristics every company would want ALL of their employees to model. She should be promoted to train the staff. Selfishly, however, there is only one Sandra and she is the only person I want to have greet me at breakfast! 
The hotel is lovely. The rooftop bar is nice. It is small. The pool doesn’t seem very useful. The view is of the park and the marina, which is not extremely interesting and does not face the sunset. The beds are VERY HARD and bad on my back, which is why I have ranked 4 stars out of 5. If I could just rate Sandra, well a million stars is not enough. Thank you!!",4,2021,10,10
18,Simply the Best,"The best hotel with the friendliest staff. They truly went above and beyond daily and did everything possible to make our stay more comfortable. We can't say enough about Serras! The cleanliness, the service, the food, everything. We truly had an amazing time in Barcelona and it started with Serras. Thank you!",5,2021,10,05
18,Best hotel experience - truly," Cannot say enough amazing things about our experience with Serra’s. Truly the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at, from aesthetic to service and hospitality. Amazing visit will be going back for sure. Thank you! ",5,2021,10,01
18,Outstanding,"After reading so much about the outstanding quality of the hotel we wanted to see what it is all about. 
And true, from the first moment onwards they foresee everything, proactively help you and assist you wherever necessary. Breakfast great, and the installations impecable. Service outstanding.

Here you can not do wrong!! Chapeau!!!",5,2021,09,28
18,Style and elegance with warmth,"Wonderful boutique hotel, centrally located, close to the sea. Personalized service throughout the hotel - from reception to rooftop restaurant. I would especially like to mention Sandra who served during breakfast and later the lunch on top restaurant!  Attention to detail and good conversations are her foremost skills - and with a warm personal touch. 
Apart from the occasional late evening noise from a bar opposite and mediocre water pressure in the shower - The Serras is THE place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2021,09,22
18,"A paradise, seaside Barcelona","Arriving Serras Hotel in Barcelona we didn’t know much about the hotel except for their rather high ratings we found online.
What we learned in reality was a lot more.
This quite small hotel gave us an incredible warm welcome with chilled small towels for hand and face while checking in.

A pleasant tour of the hotel followed while our bags was carried to our room.
The staff all gave a sense of being a happy family with a great notion of courtesy and will to help in all situations.
Facilities was in great condition. 
Even though a more demanding guest probably would have wished for a little better gym and a larger rooftop pool (not infinity as seen on the web). 

For us this was well compensated by the quality of food, service and location.",5,2021,09,19
18,Excellent and friendly,"Excellent hotel with a family feeling to it. Staff is welcoming and relaxed at the same time very professional. Breakfast was amazing and Sandra, our breakfast hostess was a delight who made us feel welcome and start the day of with a smile and great energy! Rooms are clean and well equipped, beds comfortable. The rooms are very quiet with no sounds from the street, not very common in Barcelona but very much appreciated.",5,2021,09,15
18,"A very delightful, peaceful spot in an excellent location","A  visitor to the Serras for a number of years now, their attention to detail, personal touch and excellent location, finish and overall trimmings are a delight.  Genuinely cant imagine a much better hotel experience in 30 years of travelling for pleasure and business as an adult.  The entire team and attention are a credit to the Serras - keep it up !",5,2021,09,12
18,Wedding reception and evening celebration,"I attended my son's wedding celebrations (not staying overnight), and was immediately impressed. Excellent location with beautiful views from the upstairs patio and the top floor entertainment area. Sit down multi-course lunch in the raised dining-room was of the highest order with superb service. For the evening party on the open top floor, the staff were always there in an understated manner, and nothing was too much trouble. In summary, a wonderful experience, perfect for the occasion, and I would like to think of coming for a couple of nights when next in the city! Thank you.",5,2021,09,12
18,A perfect stay in Barcelona,"Great location if you love walking The Gothic Quarter, Bonn, La Rambla, and the beach.  Lovely boutique hotel with beautiful design and warm color palette.  Amazing service levels and great rooftop restaurant and pool.",5,2021,09,08
18,Great stay for first timers!!,"We stayed at the Serras for the first 4 nights of a month long adventure that began in Barca. This boutique hotel, right at the harbor and close to  Columbus circle and the Ramblas, was the perfect place for us. All by foot, we explored the gothic neighborhoods, visited the Maritime, Picasso museums and Pedrera Mila house, and found many great tapas nearby. (Shout out to Cal Pep tapas!!) The rooftop has a lovely restaurant with fabulous views (there is also a small pool deck for guests only) where we enjoyed our first dinner in Spain. The staff that greeted us throughout our stay were very kind and accommodating. Since this trip was for our 25th anniversary, we were pleasantly surprised with the champagne that greeted us in the room…a nice touch! The breakfast is very very good and especially our server Sandra. We only had the pleasure of her interactions on two mornings where by the second visit she knew what to bring us before we even ordered….cappuccinos were practically ready before we sat down. She sat and talked with us like old friends and made us feel very comfortable. Sandra, if you are reading this, thank you! You are very special and I’m glad we met! 

All in all the Serras was a fantastic hotel that was not touristy, was very quiet and comfortable and offered a few other extras that really helped us first-time visitors to Barcelona. The rooms also come with a free smartphone that helped guide us through the sights and museums, found our way through the small streets and even allowed us to text and call family back home as well as other countries in Europe. This really was key to getting us situated n Barcelona before meeting up with our Barca-to-Florence tour group on the other side of the city.

I can’t say enough good things about the Serras hotel. Oh and I almost forgot, the building is a landmark where Pablo Picasso had his studios!

I highly recommend the Serras! We look forward to visiting again!",5,2021,09,06
18,"Small rooms, 5-star food, 5-star prices","My husband and I went to Barcelona for 4 nights and we wanted to stay in a hotel that had good service, was quiet, and close to the water and main attractions. We decided to stay at the Serras primarily because we didn’t see many noise complaints like we saw at other hotels. 
 
Staff: Lean positive 
 
Pros: 
-called before check-in to understand reason for trip and special requests
-greeted us warmly (with chocolate and cava) downstairs. Check-in was quick. They took our bags to the room.
-greeted us as we came in and out of the hotel each day
-first floor restaurant staff for breakfast on Wednesday and Thursday were attentive / respectful
-helped us schedule covid testing in the hotel for our return to the US
-lgbt friendly
 
Cons:
-entered our room (after we checked-in) without consent to leave champagne the first day while we were walking around. It was a nice gesture but I felt uncomfortable that someone came into our room for a reason other than to clean.
-top floor restaurant staff did not receive us warmly. Felt awkward / uncomfortable and didn’t go back to the terrace after the first day. I think it was a simple misunderstanding. The confusion may have been caused by us saying we had a reservation for dinner when I think reservations aren’t needed. I’m not sure, but it was not welcoming.
-felt some tension between Asian cook and the lead restaurant staffer (host / waitress) who attended us on the first floor who attended us Friday and Saturday. The host / waitress was kind and helpful to us but it was uncomfortable hearing them talk to each other in a disrespectful way. Perhaps that’s their style, but it felt hostile to me as a guest.
 
Room: Lean positive
 
Pros: 
-there’s a safe
-minibar
-big bathroom / double sink
-hot water
-strong water pressure

-small closet - only fits one suitcase
-bed is too firm
-bedding / sheets / pillow do not feel high quality
 
Noise: Lean positive
 
Pros
-gave us a room on a small side street so nearly no traffic noise 
-two separate windows to further block out sound (this is amazing)
-we heard minimal noise from outside the building (weekends are louder as there is more foot traffic)
-we slept well every night (though I used ear phones)
-I couldn’t hear neighbors on either side of me
 
Cons
-can hear partying from the terrace (loud voices and bass-heavy music). Staff said it would end around 11 but this is not true. I found this annoying but manageable as it got quiet after about midnight.
-can hear some noises from above floor - like moving chairs and other impact sounds.
-can hear hallway noises strongly
-can hear water from pipes
 
Food: Lean positive
 
Pros
-both first floor and top floor food taste good (which is hard to do in most restaurants)
 
Cons
-limited menu options for breakfast
-would like to see oatmeal and berries and more vegetable options for breakfast
-toast is too hard 
-avocado toast a plain. Recommend adding vegetables to avocado toast - perhaps pickled onions, small tomatoes, and lettuce - and a softer bread.
 
Location: Lean positive
 
Pros: central - easy access to the beach and the heart of Barcelona. Walkable and plenty of people around. Gothic quarter is a tourist area.
 
Cons: near el raval neighborhood where you need to stay alert, but didn’t have any issues other than people offering drugs on the street. We just said no kindly and kept walking.
 
Other notes 
-I used the first floor lounge as a study to do work. I also took a meeting from there. I was alone there the whole time, which is nice. I recommend adding another plug in the lounge and making it a bit more business friendly.
 
Overall takeaway: The attentive non-restaurant staff and the food make the Serras Hotel a place to stay. It’s solid. However, the overall experience feels cheaper than",4,2021,09,04
18,Three nights and two days in Barcelona,"It's been one week exactly since we've gotten back from our three week trip from Europe. Barcelona was our last country before heading home and I want to write a review while it's still fresh in my head.

We spent three nights and two jam packed days in Barcelona. This is our second time there and had spent a full week in Barcelona back in 2017. We hadn't stayed at the Serras the first time so this is my first review for the hotel.

I have nothing negative to state. Every single person we came across was smiling, accommodating, and just delightful. The location of the hotel is ideal and mostly everything is walking distance. I say mostly because it's not feasible to walk to Parc Guell or Sagrada Familia from here but everything else you'd think to do in Barcelona is a very short walk away.

The hotel was CLEAN, the rooms beautiful (all sound proof); I have to say I was really impressed with that soundproof feature as I didn't believe it until I opened the balcony door and heard how loud it was outside and when it was shut, you didn't hear a single sound, and the food really, really good.
 
I want to give Sandra the breakfast manager a HUGE shout out! She was so lovely and we were lucky to have had her two days in a row. She was sweet, prompt, helpful, and remembered our drink orders from the day before and treated us to extra treats for breakfast. It's people like Sandra that really impact your memories in a positive way. When I asked for restaurants recommendations for dinner , of course she recommended Informa (the restaurant hotel and Michelin star) but she also told us about Fismuler and I'm so glad we trusted her! She truly was the nicest. We also took her advice and tried Informal.

I wish I could remember the name of the gentleman who checked us in because he was so enthusiastic to receive us. You can really tell he loved his job. We arrived very late at night, almost midnight and he was energetic and gave us a tour of the hotel. While we were talking he mentioned he received his masters in South Florida but really liked the Northeast of the US. I wish him so much luck because his attitude was one of a future manager (if he isn't one already). 

The combination of the staff, restaurants, rooms, location, cleanliness, and detail made our short end to our Euro trip magnificent. We would certainly return and hope to do so one day. I recommend Serras Barcelona!",5,2021,08,28
18,True five-star service,"Hotel Serras is a lovely property with a great location in the Gothic Quarter and large, well appointed rooms.  Everything looks brand new and modern in style.  The rooftop restaurant and bar (with pool) is beautiful and has a great view out over the Balearic Sea.   But what REALLY stands out about the hotel is the service.  The staff is all extremely warm and helpful, and they do an amazing job of making your stay comfortable and enjoyable.  They really go the extra mile, not waiting for you to ask for things but making sure you're taken care of.  I stayed here as the last stop on a trip to half a dozen 5 star hotels and the staff at Serras really stood out.  Special shout out to Sandra, the restaurant manager, who was an absolute pleasure.  There is no question I will stay at Hotel Serras any time I visit Barcelona!",5,2021,08,26
18,Celebrating our 25th Anniversary ,"Simply no better place to stay in Barcelona..the location is perfect, rooms are clean and modern.  The food in the restaurant is beyond delicious and most importantly the staff is amazing. Making us feel like the only guests in the hotel.  Sandra at breakfast had our special order coffees ready and waiting for us before we even sat down.  The waitress in the restaurant, very blond hair and very nice also bent over backwards to give us a memorable experience.  The rooftop bartender was also wonderful.. honestly, every single person that works her that we interacted with made this experience one that makes me look forward to the next time we get to return to Serras!",5,2021,08,24
18,Exceptional Hotel: Best in Barcelona!,"Best boutique hotel in Barcelona! The customer service is the best we experienced of all five star hotels we stayed in this summer in Spain, France, and England. Truly exceptional. Ona, the General Manager, is one of a kind in her personal touch to make every guest feel very special and clearly she has inspired her entire team to do the same. The customer service at every turn was above and beyond. Every restaurant recommendation was out of this world—especially Bar Mut and Concina Hermanos Torres. The roof deck amazing. The location just perfect!",5,2021,08,22
18,The best hotel in hotel in Barcelona and probably Spain,"The Serras is the best hotel in Barcelona because of the exceptional staff and it’s location. It’s close to the beaches and the city centre/shops. Unlike the larger hotels it offers individual service. Nothing is too much trouble. The Almas/mandarin oriental has posher rooms, the arts and W are bigger hotels, Olivia Balmes much cheaper and the National more traditional. If you want to stay in a well located, good value, great hotel with excellent service the Serras is the best option by far in Barcelona and probably in Spain",5,2021,08,18
18,Trendy hotel with rooftop pool and excellent service,"We spent a wonderful child free weekend at this 5 star hotel. The service was impeccable, very friendly and personable. We had superb restaurant recommendations from them even our last minute meal for Sunday lunch (probably our favourite) was stunning.
We stayed in the room one up from the basic and had lots of space and it was well appointed, including 2 sinks and a nice little balcony with partial view. It was handy being on the 5th floor, so we could just walk up to the rooftop and pool.
No need to book the pool and mostly there was sufficient deck chairs for guests to use.
Would definitely go back. Located between beach and gothic quarter was a real bonus too.

For breakfast we went to Honest Greens ( great coffee and plant based breakfast options).
Lunch we visited local market.
Dinners - rooftop at hotel Serras (Informal Restaurant)
- Bar Canete 

Lunch at Dos Pebrots 

All restaurants were recommended by hotel and all excellent!
",5,2021,08,17
18,Slightly overpriced - very small rooftop,"Although the service if very friendly and the the food is delicious, I believe that the hotel is slightly understaffed. This is likely due to COVID, but it does impact the 5 star experience that you are still paying for. The restaurants operate with a limited menu and the rooftop it way too small, also people at the restaurant and visitors are staring at you and take pictures of the guests at the pool - there is really 0 privacy. Rooms are OK, but I believe there are better 5 star options for similar prices in Barcelona.",3,2021,08,15
18,Impressed unique hotel,We travel a lot even at this complicated time. And we don't write so many reviews because we don't have such bright impressions usually. But this hotel is a unique one. A fantastic location and amazing view from the roof top are just a small part of its advantages. Let me list a few more—clean and perfectly designed rooms with champagne Reinart in mini-bar and hair straighteners for ladies in wardrobes. The staff is super friendly. The general manager greeted us in person at breakfast. Everyone has to try their cocktails at the roof bar - it's magic from their barman. That's really 5 of 5.,5,2021,08,08
18,Serras is the place to stay in Barcelona!,"From the moment we arrived the staff's attention to detail and service was outstanding. From the front desk to the rooftop Serras is the best . Professional , competent and pleasant is engrained in the DNA of the service at Serras.",5,2021,08,07
18,Family trip to Barcelona,"First family trip in 24 months. We chose Spain and began with Barcelona.  What an amazing way to set off our trip in your country.  Amazingly helpful and hospitable staff.  From the front desk to Sandra, our breakfast manager.  Beautiful rooms and service.  Nothing I would change or critique. ",5,2021,08,07
18,Outstanding service / beautiful hotel,"Hotel is beautiful and located right on the Columbus boardwalk. Everything is super clean and tastefully decorated. The service is really first rate. The breakfast service is worth special mention. The always cheerful cafe manager Sandra serves up a fantastic continental breakfast of fresh squeezed orange juice, buttery croissants, and Iberian ham. She remembered my coffee order after the first morning, making a sleepy start to the day a bit easier.",5,2021,08,06
18,Outstanding hotel,"Top flight boutique hotel at a great location. The staff could not have been more helpful, available and charming. No need was too small, and every amenity was thought through. We will stay at the Serras during our next Barcelona visit. ",5,2021,08,05

18,Wonderful,"My daughter decided to do 7 weeks of school in Barcelona.  Neither of us had been to Europe before.  The 3 days/4 nights I had with my daughter before leaving her in Barcelona for school was special and The Serras was a big part of it!  The ENTIRE TEAM was wonderful!  The room, the restaurants, the location - everything about The Serras was a pleasure.  Despite being on a busy road the rooms were quiet.  Walking distance to beach, La Rambla, Barcelona Cathedral and so much more.  The staff helped with transportation, reservations, tours and general advise as to how best to pack the time we had before school started. I will stay there again, without a doubt.",5,2021,08,03
18,Perfect Location and Food,"We were greeted outside by Marjorie who took our bags, checked us in, and gave us a tour prior to escorting us to our room. While checking in we were presented with cool towels, chocolate and cava, all very nice touches that really set the tone for our stay.

Our room had a small sofa and 2 Juliette balconies and we really enjoyed opening the (double for quiet) glass doors to listen to the city in the evenings. We also had a beautiful tray with sausage, brioche and chocolates and a cold bottle of cava waiting in the room. 

The hotel is located in a fantastic area a bit off of the tourist drag and within walking distance to most everything. 

The staff is warm and helpful and we would definitely return. 

Helpful? Thumbs up please.",5,2021,08,02
18,Excellent Stay,"Fabulous hotel with the most amazing rooftop.  The staff was so accommodating and helpful in arranging out dinners and Covid testing.

18,Stylish and cool,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at The Serras for our honeymoon. The hotel itself is the perfect mix of boutique luxury with an informal, home from home feel.

18,hotel serras,"hotel serras was the best hotel expierence i’ve ever had. I have stayed at baddruts palace in switzerland and this service and this service and stay was better. Sandra the breakfast manager made our stay extraordinary. Everybody was very helpful, very accommodating will return.",5,2021,07,23
18,Great place,"Wonderful hotel. Small and quaint, very clean. Best part is the service. We stayed 4 nights and our first trip to Barcelona. The staff went beyond helpful. Sandra at breakfast was incredible, going so far as to give us tips on Seville and Cordoba, even printing places to see. We had a great recommendations for restaurants as well from several of the staff. Could not recommend a better hotel. Great location as well near beach and in the gothic quarter. Pool is small, but a great place to just sit and enjoy the sun and view.  Will definitely be back.",5,2021,07,20
18,Serras is the soul of Barcelona,"I enjoyed again my two weeks stay in a small boutique-styled hotel Serras. Staff from cleaning ladies to the front desk are positive,  professional, and helpful.  Most of the staff have been here for years. I want to give a special mention to Sandra as she is creating a sunny feeling in the breakfast and cheering up all the quests in the Catalan morning!",5,2021,07,19
18,A perfect place in the heart of Barcelona,"Our idea of a perfect place includes location, size (we prefer smaller places), quality of rooms, bathrooms, and common areas, a friendly helpful staff, and a good restaurant.  Hotel Serras had all of those things plus a bonus of a rooftop (6 floor building) bar and small pool.  And the location is perfect!  We walked everywhere we wanted to go. We highly recommend Hotel Serras.",5,2021,07,18
18,Beyond Excellence,"Hotel Serras is like no other hotel in Barcelona or in Europe, the staff were super friendly, helpful and attentive to even single details. From the reception, to the restaurant and last but not least the rooftop. 

This is a very well managed boutique hotel with 5* service for real, not just a claim.

Highly recommended, and will definitely stay there again.",5,2021,07,03
18,This is the place to stay,"Not only is the staff, including Sofia, Carolina, and all, excellent with keen attention to detail, but the property is beautiful, first-class, and fantastic.  We were not sure where to stay in Barcelona, but the Serras is near everything.  On the promenade at the edge of the Gothic Quarter, blocks to the Ramblas, blocks to Barceloneta.  You can truly walk to the best and, when you return to the Serras, you will be welcomed to your hone away from home where the staff knows you name and your favorite drink.  One of the best places I have ever stayed in the world.",5,2021,06,22
18,Best of the Best,"Excellent service.  First-class staff, especially Sonia, Carolina, and the property manager.  Not only are the accommodations top-notch, but the amenities, food, cocktails, and staff unparalleled.  Our stay in Barcelona was wonderful.  Highest recommendation.",5,2021,06,22
18,Georgeous hotel with rooftop bar,"Cozy hotel with a relaxed but classy vibe and a fantastic staff, who made you feel at home from the first moment on...
Small but delicious breakfast and a fantastic restaurant and bar

18,The best design boutique hotel in Barcelona,"I've been coming more than 20 years to Barcelona. Serras has been my all-time favourite.

The hotel restaurant has Michelin stars! Enjoy!",5,2021,01,04
18,Remote working  - a great hotel,"Escaped one week to work remotely from Barcelona and was suggested this hotel from my travel advisor. What a wonderful surprise   especially the staff   breakfast is fantastic and food is delicious.

18,"Great Location and Food, but Service is a bit lacking","We loved our time here, but their service can improve. They do not greet you when you walk in and it is more casual here. The professionalism is lacking a bit. The food is good, the rooftop cafe is good, we had two suites adjoining and they were very nice with great balcony views. Great location because walking distance to the Pier and shopping and tours. I recommend this place!",4,2020,04,12
18,Serras!!!,"This hotel should be a 7 star, it’s amazing, you don’t even need to leave the resort at all. Everything you can think off, has already been thought about and put in place.
I have traveled the world and always go to 5 star hotels but this hotel is beyond a 5 star. The food is amazing, the rooms are amazing, the staff are amazing and there is not one thing I can fault this place on.
You haven’t lived life if you don’t come here. Amazing weather as well.
It’s like a bit of heaven has touched earth.",5,2020,03,24
18,The best hotel we’ve ever stayed at,"I would give this hotel more than 5 stars if I could. Apart from being a beautiful property in superb location, the most striking aspect of this hotel is the staff and the level of service. I have never been to a hotel like the Serras where I was truly convinced that the staff were genuinely very happy to be there and loved what they do. And this was at every level. From Diego the reception manager to the reception staff, the doormen, the restaurant staff to the room staff. They are highly attentive without being intrusive, very knowledgeable about their property and their city and immaculately well trained without hint of pretentiousness. I did not meet the manager but he and his team are to be commended. 

We were there for 7 days during the corona virus crisis and the Serras made our stay a pleasure in a very difficult and anxious time. 

We hope to return to Barcelona in better times and one of the reasons will be the Serras.",5,2020,03,15
18,Great experience,"My wife and I spent 3 wonderful nights here.  Had to try it based on the reviews and didnt disappoint.  Service of a Ritz in a small intimate boutique hotel setting
 
Checkin staff were perfect.  Hot Towels and drinks upon arrival
She showed us our room and whole hotel.
Bellhop super friendly helped with luggage and anything we needed.
Hotel arranged dinner reservation one night as well as airport transfer each way.
Housekeeping perfect. 
Had a bottle of Cava in room upon arrival as well as chocolates.
Fresh water in glass bottle and different treat for each of us at night.  
Location great in gothic quarter.
Rooftop nice.  Would use small pool in summer not heated for winter 
Only 20some rooms so really nice feel. 
We had a junior suite was nice bedding very comfortable pillows great.  Nice rain shower. 
Got breakfast package nice buffet and hot options omelet etc.
Staff was really what made stay special.  Would love to go back again next time in Barcelona.  ",5,2020,03,08
18,Wonderful boutique hotel providing personalized experience,"This tastefully appointed boutique hotel has a mere 28 rooms, which helped make our stay here memorable as the employees (Carolina et al) really made us feel like we were taken care of.  They went above and beyond to help us and meet our needs, from switching our room to another one (an upgrade!) on a different floor owing to noisy neighbors, to calling the airport umpteen times to get our missing luggage to us. I can't stress enough how genuinely friendly, helpful, and professional they are. The hotel restaurant was AMAZING - we had dinner there twice and it was absolutely the culinary highlight of our trip. I think it is greatly underrated and it is a MUST. The rooftop is great - calm, intimate, with great cocktails, a view, and a pool. I really can't recommend this hotel enough and I look forward to staying here again soon.  ",5,2020,02,27
18,Great hotel,"Stayed 3 nights and had lovely time , Hotel
Is located in great place within walking distance to all the shops ,bars , beach , cable cars etc. Roof top terrace was great we would have a last drink of the evening here after being in town and it’s got great views.Staff very friendly and helpful. We never ate in the Resturant as we were out and about most of the time.Room was to the rear but quiet with double layer window to soundproof , we had no issues.
All in all a lovely break will go again and stay same place.",5,2020,02,25

It is also very nicely situated very close to all the main sites, so very easy to explore by foot.  My room was first class, very impressive decor as well. A brilliant stay.",5,2020,02,21
18,Housing doing what should be finished,"Lodging The Serras is organized near the clamoring street of Barcelona, Spain and it is perfect for someone like me who is pursuing down an accomplice to break down the city. Overwhelming hotel to remain, offers fulfilling and tidy up rooms, equipped with the some complimentary stocks. Clear take a gander at in and check. Burden free, should need to remain to some degree considerably more yet I have prior duties. Regardless, for without request I'll be back. Sustenance and refreshments in the bistro are when all is said in done extraordinary.",5,2020,02,20
18,Amazing Hotel. Highly recommended,"This hotel has it all. I can't recommended this hotel more highly. What follows can't do it justice. Great location, superb and solicitous staff, stunningly well appointed rooms (particularly appreciated the triple glazing on the windows  and the wonderful rain shower), excellent breakfast, a lovely roof terrace. My only tiny niggle was the restaurant recommendation from the front desk which was poor. If you are looking for a luxury boutique hotel experience, look no further.",5,2020,02,15

The roof terrace bar was fantastic, the dinner insuperable, the rooms were very clean and the service extremely accommodating

From the moment you enter and check in you feel welcome. 
The staff is very hospitable and cares to your needs.
Rooms are nice with lots of space, we stayed in a grand deluxe room which offers everything you might need.

The hotel offers a fantastic Michelin star restaurant and an exceptionally good rooftop bar.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough, if you're looking for a hotel in Barcelona I suggest you look no further.",5,2020,02,03
18,Excellent Hotel,This hotel was excellent. Great location and even better service.  The staff is outstanding. Our room was flood and the hotel itself is very nice.  We recommend this place.  It was a very enjoyable five day stay.,5,2020,01,31
18,staff and location was the highlight of our trip!,We loved the Serras.  Location was awesome and allowed for a lot of walking.

The interior design is fantastic, the staff go out of their way to help you make the most of your stay and really care in a personal way, something that is very hard to find.
And the breakfast is probably the best I‘ve had in my life!
Congrats to the team - you are great!",5,2020,01,25
18,"Great location, top-notch service, highly recommend","We stayed at the hotel over the holidays (late Dec/early Jan) for 5 nights with our two teen-aged children and had a fantastic stay. From the moment we walked into the door, everyone was so helpful and welcoming. Not once during our stay did we ever feel like anything was an inconvenience. The staff was always looking for ways to make the stay the best possible. They helped us set up tours (some ahead of time), a cooking class, and were there to answer any request we had. The service was fantastic. 

THE HOTEL AND ROOMS
The rooms are on the smaller side but very well done. Comfortable beds, nice bathrooms, and not only did they have hairdryers, but also a flat iron for hair which was a nice extra. 

The second floor is a lounge area where you can have a cocktail and/or play board games (which they supply), and it overlooks the restaurant downstairs. We spent some time there in the evenings. It was nice to have somewhere to hang out with our kids, other than our rooms. 

There is a small pool on the rooftop deck with a nice view. We didn't use it because it was winter time but for those who stay during warmer weather, it looks great. 

THE RESTAURANT AND ROOFTOP BAR
The restaurant has wonderful food. We ate every breakfast there, and a few dinners, including New Year's Eve. 

The rooftop bar was a huge bonus, especially with Alejandro mixing up the most original and amazing cocktails. 

THE LOCATION
We walked almost everywhere from the hotel, and where we couldn't get by walking, they were very helpful in arranging taxis or whatever other transportation was needed. 

One morning we rented bikes a few blocks away and rode along the beach. 

We noticed there is also a train station within a few blocks of the hotel, for those who are coming or going via train. 

I would recommend this hotel without hesitation, and we will definitely be back the next time we are in Barcelona.",5,2020,01,10
18,Safe neighborhood. Incredible staff!!,"This hotel was in the perfect location to walk to most major landmarks. The staff is incredible, kind and go out of their way to make everyone comfortable. The location is safe and central. Breakfast did not disappoint as the hotel has a Michelin chef. I recommend eating dessert at the hotel in the evening.",5,2020,01,09
18,"Really, really good. Really.","We had a fantastic experience with The Serras.  The hotel rooms are well appointed and the staff... well, they just could not be friendlier or more helpful. So, I am going to offer some minor quibbles below, but none of those makes me question a 5-star rating for this review.  The Serras is great and we would absolutely, definitely stay there again... and hopefully will. (We love Barcelona.)

Positive notes:
The roof deck has a wonderful view and is a very nice spot to relax. Make sure you go up there!
The roof was where Picasso had one of his first studios. You can't access it, but at the Picasso Museum, there is at least one thing The Serras donated!

Minor negative notes:
The restaurant - service is excellent, but the food is B+.  That's not bad, but it's not as good as the whole reset of The Serras experience, and it's a bit overpriced.  It's Barcelona - there are a lot of great places to get food so go out.

The room designs (we saw two) feature a translucent panel between the bathroom and the bedroom. This is very stylish, but very impractical.  If someone gets up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, the light floods the bedroom and may wake others.  Bring a nightlight you can use in the bathroom so the lights need not be turned on.",5,2020,01,02
18,Wonderful ezperienxe,"Hotel the Serras is a lovely boutique hotel near the Gothic Quarter. With only about 2 dozen rooms and ample staff, service was amazing. There was no moment when there wasn’t someone available to take of any need. Rooms were lovely, very clean, nicely appointed, average size by European standards, but with a large bathroom. There is a nice rooftop area for dinner or a drink. It’s also a cool extra that the building once housed Picasso’s studio. Highly recommend. ",5,2019,12,31
18,"Best Hotel Experience-great service, beautiful rooms, many high end details and Michelin Star restaurant","The service from the moment you walk in is outstanding.And each person we encountered went out of their way to anticipate our needs.  Stayed twice for multiple days and was consistently exceeding expectations. Views from both rooms were exceptional. Great location.  When asked if we could get a small slice of cake to celebrate our adult son’s birthday in the evening, they went all out with a beautiful little cake, and an area set aside for us, all “on the house.”  The rooms are beautiful and if you’d like to try different pillows, they completely accommodated our requests!",5,2019,12,31
18,One of the best hotels in the world,"I can't gush enough about this property.  From the moment we sat down to register, we were treated like VIP guests with a glass of cava.  We had a hand written note from the general manager, Antonio, who went out of his way each day to greet guests.  The room was very quiet, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large with great lighting and I want the mirrors for my own house.
The restaurant was delicious.  Sandra, the manager, went out of her way each day to make us comfortable and treated us like we were family entering her dining room.  She showed such genuine warmth and kindness that she actually brought a tear to my eye.
Highly recommended!",5,2019,12,18
18,Everything was in great working condition,"The room was spacious, nice and clean. Cleanliness was close to perfect  It’s a really nice place well located. The staff at the hotel was absolutely amazing from check-in to check-out. Everything was in great working condition.",5,2019,12,18
18,A wonderful stay at our hotel in Barcelona,"We stayed at the Hotel Serras in November
Lost days on our trip due to flight  cancellations we arrived exhausted,stressed and very tired the management and all the staff made us feel so welcomed. 
From the glasses of Cava to an excellent 
late night dinner
Our room was beautiful our short stay the same

Thank you

18,Superb service,"I am so glad we went to this hotel. Service is what they live for! The room is spectacular, comfortable, stylish. Every afternoon, they would come in and organize our room for night time, leave fresh cold water, and a dessert (yay) on top of the morning cleaning service. And they have a Pillow Menu! Walking distance to many attractions, walked to the beach to check it out, and took barely 10 minutes, close to cable car to Montjuïc, close to gothic quarter, in other words: perfect location. The restaurant was also excellent. Already recommending to my in laws who are coming in May.",5,2019,12,10
18,Best Hotel and Staff in Barcelona,"What an incredible stay we had at The Serras. From the moment we arrived the staff was so helpful, informative, and made us feel right at home. They booked our activities, planned some dinners, and help create one of the best vacations we have ever had. The hotel is beautiful, chic, and is located walking distance to most of the must see things to do in Barcelona. The hotel has everything you need. And if there’s something they don’t have they will make sure to get it for you... and with a smile. I don’t often review on TripAdvisor, but I wanted to make sure the staff knew how much their attention to detail meant to us. We have traveled extensively and this was hands-down one of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed in. My husband and I were there without our children, we found the hotel to be romantic and charming. There was champagne in our room when we arrived with a beautiful note for his birthday. Each night there was another delicious treat left for us. The rooms were clean and hotel spotless.  I actually felt sad leaving as I knew we had had a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Barcelona and the Hotel Serras was a huge part of our great vacation. They deserve their five stars.  ",5,2019,12,09
18,Best Hotel Ever! ,"This hotel is extraordinary! The staff in every position at this hotel are friendly, knowledgeable, professional and efficient.  I echo some of the other reviews: we have stayed in many hotels around the world and none of them come close to providing the positive experience we have had at this hotel. They literally called me 20 minutes after I booked the reservation to see if they could help with any of our planning - and they did. They managed all of our reservations and helped plan our trip We too extended our stay because of the wonderful time we were having. The hotel is very well situated between the beach and the gothic quarter.  I highly recommend it.",5,2019,12,08
18,Tour visit,"Excellent staff and receiving is too good and extremely convineint to stay and the clenliness is tooo good in the hotel,,I want to visit this as many times possible..the staff and workers are extremely good and too fast response from the hotel staff and I want tooo goo many times",5,2019,12,08
18,Best Hotel Experience of my Life,"There are not enough positive things to say about this hotel, from the room, to the location, to the food, to perhaps the most important -- people who work here.  We changed our stay from 4 to 9 days and skipped our one opportunity to visit Marseille, just because of this hotel.
I've probably spent over 3,000 nights in hotels, possibly more.  Please factor that into your reading of this recommendation.",5,2019,12,04
18,Superior service and location,"Better service than a Ritz, St. Regis, Four Seasons, etc!
The staff is second to none; the location is ideal and the atmosphere relaxing and classy.
Outstanding food available 24/7.  A must if you are going to Barcelona!",5,2019,12,03
18,Excellent place to stay in Barcelona,"Service is great. Located in the gothic quarter, walking distance to La Rambla. Would definitely recommend . Quiet rooms, well appointed, shower was awesome, staff was friendly and very helpful. Great location.",5,2019,12,01
18,Gem of a hotel,"We stayed for four nights at this gem of a hotel and were so impressed by the quality of the service.  The staff went out of their way to help us in every way possible.  The food in the restaurant was delicious, we ate there on the first night.  The rest of the time we were in meetings so we did not have the opportunity to try anything else.  We will return.",5,2019,11,30
18,The best Luxury hotel in Barcelona,"The Serras is an authentic experience. I love it from arrival to departure. The service is beyond excellent. The location is fantastic, I love the feeling of the Gothic quarter but without being in the middle of it. The hotel is delightful, you feel like don't want to leave. We also eat at the Restaurant and loved the food and the ambience. It was a truly great exprience. Highly recommend it. ",5,2019,11,29
18,A dream come true,"The best hotel in the planet.  Beautiful, amazing stay for three nights.  The best staff ever.  They do everything for please you.  Love everything there. We love the breakfast every morning. Location is great, near every place you want to see.  Thanks!!!",5,2019,11,28
18,Simply outstanding,"What an amazing property!! The staff, the facilities, attention to detail, impecable rooms, warm aproach, great rooftop and beautiful cuisine at Informal restaurant. No doubt...the place to stay on my next visit to Barcelona. ",5,2019,11,28
18,Absolutely amazing in every way,"A stunning boutique hotel where nothing is too much trouble. Every time I turned around I felt like someone was offering me a chocolate or a nibble of something. Cava on arrival, mimosas at breakfast, the best breakfast I’ve ever had. Anywhere. Ever!
The staff are absolutely amazing, Sergio and Sandra stood out as absolute diamonds who are masters at their trade. On arrival the lady at the desk gave us a map and highlighted the routes and things to see, giving us both tips on popular tourist spots and lesser known areas that the locals love. There were two general managers, the lady manager introduced herself and spoke to us daily. She was super approachable and friendly.
We loved the rooftop terrace bar, even in November, with the heaters and blankets we stayed up until 3am chatting to new friends. Whilst the bar closed around 12 the bar manager made sure we had plenty to keep us going before she left and told us to call down to reception if we needed anything else. The rooftop terrace is open to guests 24 hours.
The food in the hotel was so good we ate there twice and had friends to visit. The croquettes were the best I’ve had in my life and the Patatas bravas were amazing and unique. I love that they had both informal and formal dining options, as depending on the mood I’m in I might want to go either way. There’s no dress code in the informal dining area but you’re getting the same Michelin menu that is served in the formal dining area.
The hotel smells amazing 24/7 and you can actually buy the scent of the hotel which we did. 
The location is also excellent, putting you in close proximity to the marina, the gothic quarter and la Rambla.
I’m the type of person who likes to go somewhere different every time I travel but I wouldn’t hesitate to go here again, I loved it that much. It’s the people that made the difference for me on this trip.",5,2019,11,26
18,Great boutique hotel,"The Serras is a first rate boutique hotel in a great location to see Barcelona. Staff went out of their way to make our visit the best experience possible. Not an inexpensive property but we’ll worth the splurge.

18,Carol Ann Corrigan,"MADE US FEEL SO SPECIAL & WELCOMED!
Greeted at reception by Daniel who served us drinks and gave us a fresh wash cloth.
Diego showed us to our room and described all of its amenities. 
When our relatives from Germany traveled to be with us for two nights (they stayed at a different hotel), Eduardo, the restaurant manager, helped us plan a beautiful family dinner for all 8 of us, especially since they didn't eat fish or seafood. Service was maravilloso!
The next day my husband misplaced 8 tickets he purchased online for the Picasso Museum. Our front desk person, Marjorie, contacted the Museum when it opened at 9 am, called us as we visited the Sagrada Familia, and told us a duplicate set of tickets were available for us at the Museum--saving us almost 100 euros! Fantastique, Marjorie!
Every time we left the hotel, Emiliano,  would offer us water to take along, and ordered us taxis whenever needed.What a gracious and thoughtful young man!
The roof deck was heaven! Marcello was so pleasant offering us drinks and chips and a wonderful smile.

18,Favorite Hotel in Barcelona ,"My wife and I spent three nights at the Serras prior to a Cycling tour of Costa Brava. We could not have asked for a better experience. The hotel is in a great location and is an easy walk to the beach area, the Born neighborhood and La Ramblas.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a glass of cava and given a tour of this small boutique hotel. The gentleman who gave us the tour, Daniel, was invaluable to us throughout our stay with great dining and other suggestions. 

The roof top bar area of the hotel was our favorite spot to spend time. They serve excellent drinks and tapas. One of the bartenders, Louis, made us his special drink which he created for a European competition. If he is working during your stay ask for this drink. It was fabulous.  

The breakfast was very good with cooked to order eggs and pretty classic European fair such as cheeses, cured meats, wonderful bread and pastries. Sandra, the breakfast manager, was very nice and each morning brought us a delicious bowl of fresh fruit to go along with our breakfast. 

Our room was larger than other rooms we have experienced in Europe and very modern. The staff provided excellent customer service and all spoke English making it a easy to communicate.

The Serras will be our go to hotel for all our future visits to Barcelona. ",5,2019,10,03

If ever in Barcelona this is the place to stay.",5,2019,10,03
18,Fantastic for a Short Stay,"The Serras is an exceptional hotel located centrally in Barcelona making most of the sights-to-see within walking distance. Food throughout Barcelona is very pleasant but both dinner and breakfast. We had breakfast every day at the hotel, each time to be warmly welcomed by Sandra. This was always a fantastic start to the day. We also ate twice at the restaurant - once on the first night of our stay and then we returned on our last night, so hopefully this says something about how much we enjoyed it! The rooftop is very nice and serves great views and good cocktails. The staff throughout the hotel are lovely and the rooms were spacious and well looked after.

I would 100% recommend this hotel for other people to stay.",5,2019,10,02
18,Exceptional,"From the moment we entered until the moment we left we were impressed with the service, the ambiance and the attention to detail of Hotel The Serras. And the location was amazing. Thus us our 4th trip to Barcelona and our 4th hotel. We will be back to Barcelona and we will definitely be back to The Serras. ",5,2019,10,01
18,No regrets for an unlucky beginning,"Normally good things used to be started with some fun case and our arrival to The Serras Hotel had been done exactly that way: the taxi driver took us to another hotel. So funny so good: our preparation for the hard rock hurricane with Bon Jovi had begun.
Staff’s being so friendly, Barcelona’s evening looked so romantic - everything supported us to pull ourselves together before a coming sea cruise. Hotel’s absolutely nice location provided a good vicinity to the main sightseeings in the Barrio Gótico.
And the Hotel restaurant turned out to be its hidden gem: two evenings with two fantastic dinners. Both seafood and steaks were so tasty - even for the rockers’ opinion.
And we rocked the boat after that.",5,2019,09,30
18,Outstanding boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"I typically don't like small, boutique hotels but this one was recommended to us by our travel agent.  I have to tell you that it was a wonderful experience.  The staff there is beyond friendly and accommodating.  Their rooftop bar gives you great views of the city with delicious cocktails.

18,The Best!,"Stayed here with friends on a 4 day visit to Barcelona. 
I’ve traveled the world and stayed in more hotels then I care to remember and I really hate the “ratings star inflation” that predominates reviews these days. 
But this really is 5 star!
The service, attention to detail, comfort of the beds, quality of the breakfast, location roof top bar, and best of all the staff. To be greeted for breakfast by Sandra the restaurant manger was a wonderful way to start our day. And the welcome we would get on our return from touring was always warm and genuine.  I can see why this is the #1 hotel in Barcelona...deserved and 5 stars across the board!",5,2019,09,29
18,The best service in 35 years of international travel,"I'm not one to usually have the time to write online reviews, but in this instance I have to share our experience.
My fiancé and I were going to walk over to Soho House, and checked before we left with the staff on the front desk as to whether it was going to rain or not.  They checked and sad that no, it was not going to.
Of course, as soon as we got to the Soho House rooftop, the heavens opened and it poured down.
The wonderful staff called me three times (to make sure they got through) to; (a) apologize, and (b) ask if there was ANYTHING they could do.
They had no idea that we were so close and were prepared to send out someone to ""rescue"" us.
In the end, by the time we'd finished our evening, it had stopped raining, BUT if this is indicative of the level of service at this hotel (and I know it is) then you should not have ANY hesitation in booking this fantastic hotel with its fantastic staff.
I hope they read this and truly understand how much I appreciate it and how I compare them against so many years of travel.
Thank you.",5,2019,09,25

18,Simply the best,"Location , location just perfect close to lots of attractions. Perfect for eating out, very close to the marina for long walks and just sitting and watching the world go by. Hotel was magical with great staff nothing was too much trouble. Rooms very clean and sweet smelling ! ",5,2019,09,21
18,Cannot improve on perfection,"We just came back from a 3 night stay and it was amazing.  The staff were warm, knowledgeable, and friendly.  There was nothing they would not do to make your stay enjoyable.  They even walked to us through the Gothic quarter to make sure we didn't get lost trying to find a store.  Also provided special meal and were so careful with a food allergy.  We unfortunately had a lot of rain, but were met at our car with umbrellas.  Can't say enough about the manager and the entire staff.  We loved every minute.  ",5,2019,09,18
18,Loved The Serras,"We stayed for 6 nights as part of our anniversary trip. The Serras was amazing. We pulled up during a huge rainstorm. The staff rushed out with umbrellas to help us in with our luggage. After we were inside they gave us big towels to dry off with and offered us champagne or coffee. 
When we got to our room, it was just gorgeous. The bathroom and bedroom were well appointed and modern. Big fluffy towels and a comfortable bed. 
We loved the rooftop bar, all of the staff were so friendly. We ate dinner one night at the hotel restaurant Informal and had a great meal.
Every time we left the hotel the staff were so helpful with directions or getting a cab. ",5,2019,09,18
18,Can I move in? :),"Stayed in a Grand Deluxe Room (so spacious!) for 4 nights with my husband and we could not have loved this hotel more. The service was impeccable. Everyone referred to us by name after the first day and were so kind. Everything was high end, even the Etre towels at the pool. They even had a fantastic hair straightener in the room (and I am super picky about hair dryers and I wanted to steal the one in the room it was that phenomenal, lol!). Walking distance to everything - the beach, restaurants, nightlife, and all the sites. The onsite restaurant, Informal, was phenomenal as well. Honestly, if I could move in, I would. Highly recommend!",5,2019,09,15
18,Wonderful stay at The Serras,"Spent 8 wonderful nights at this great hotel. Modern esthetic but warm and inviting. Every single member of the staff with whom we interacted was helpful, friendly and genuine. The room was definitely cozy but that's to be expected in a large city. Food was delicious both in the restaurant and rooftop. And at turndown they don't give a mundane chocolate on the pillow, you get a wonderful little bite from the pastry chef. Highly recommend The Serras!",5,2019,09,15
18,My best hotel stay ever,"I went to Spain for a special occasion.  The hotel staff, especially Sandra, who we saw for breakfast, and Daniel, who helped us at the front door, went out of their way to make our stay exceptional. Our rooms were clean and comfy.  We loved the little treats with the nightly turn down service.  And my gluten free spouse found a wide variety of options on the menu.  We’ll definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2019,09,14
18,Our home away from home,"After spending the last month traveling across Italy, France and now Spain we have stayed in a number of 4/5 star hotels. I feel as if I’m becoming somewhat of an expert on what great looks like. This hotel and the team that work there are great! They operate like a family, with the hotel only having 28 rooms. How often do you hug the people when you leave?

They made a point of knowing us, the manager greeted us each morning at breakfast, as he did everyone who was dining. A big shout out to Sergio and Sandra who were incredible, their care and assistance second to none. 

The facilities also exceeded our expectations hairdryer and hair straightener,  best shower we have experienced so far, great beds and a choice of 6 different types of pillows. We arrived to champagne and each night looked forward to a special treat left after turndown. The rooftop bar and pool aren’t bad either. 

Located in the Gothic quarter within walking distance to just about everything. Couldn’t fault this hotel in any way. It was an absolute pleasure to stay there and we were sad to leave. We will be back!",5,2019,09,14
18,Exceeded Expectations ,"We reserved a room for two nights at the Hotel Serras at the end of our cruise, for our first time visiting Barcelona.  

We reserved direct through the hotel website and received prompt confirmation.  I emailed the hotel a few times with questions and responses were prompt and helpful.  

We were greeted with a glass of Cava and a warm welcome upon arrival.  I regret I do not recall the name of the special lady who checked us in (she is originally from Portugal).  She gave us a tour of the hotel and escorted us to our room and made certain we understood all of the features.  The entire team at Hotel Serras is fabulous.  We have never received such warm, friendly, and excellent service.  They were so helpful with restaurant recommendations and tour arrangements. All recommendations were spot on. 

The hotel is attractive and immaculately maintained.  The rooftop bar was special at night, overlooking the marina.  The location is perfect. Easy walking distance to the Gothic District, La Rambla (meh, but go once), and the beach.  

Some reviews have been critical regarding the cost of the breakfast at the hotel restaurant “Informal”. Although the full breakfast buffet is a bit pricey, food is excellent.  We ordered ala Carter breakfast and found it to be reasonably priced and excellent.  There are also many restaurants near the hotel.  

Barcelona is a gem of a destination, and The Hotel Serras is a gem of a hotel in Barcelona. Our expectations were exceeded and we will return.",5,2019,09,13
18,thanks for everything,Your gratitude and reputation comes before your name sir. I think you have earned this 5-star review. Then it took some time to get here. We probably come here again in 2 years I think. If family matters let me I should come here shortly again.,5,2019,09,13
18,Great Boutique,"We recently stayed for 2 nights. Every aspect was top notch. Service, food, helpfulness and friendliness of staff and comfort of the room all were excellent. Oh and the location can’t be beat for anyone touring Barcelona. So much to do so close by!",5,2019,09,12
18,Best Hotel I Ever Stayed At (I've stayed at a bunch),"I had forgotten to write a review of my late August 2019 3 night stay at The Serras. But I just found the personalized, hand written note from the staff at The Serras. They thanked me for staying there. What hotel writes you a note like that? Not too many. When my taxi dropped me off from the cruise terminal at The Serras I carelessly dropped my iPhone on the taxi seat. The doorman from The Serras who opened the taxi door saw my phone & grabbed it before the taxi pulled away (saved me lots of trouble). 
Diego at the front desk recommended amazing tapas restaurants. The room was amazing. Clean, modern with a balcony. 
I never really figured out the bidet. Bed was comfortable. Two sinks in bathroom. 
Staff was so friendly I was a little scared (being from Brooklyn, I'm suspicious of very nice people). Rooftop so relaxing. 
Worth every penny.",5,2019,09,09
18,"charming boutique hotel, convenient to major attractions... outstanding staff!",The rooms are well appointed and fairly spacious for a city hotel.  But it's the staff that's the real differentiator here.  They were not overbearing but were always there to meet our every need.  They were quick with a recommendation when we were looking for one or happy to let us go and explore on our own with a kind word of support and encouragement.,5,2019,09,09
18,Lovely stay in Barcelona,Sweet little boutique hotel with amazing attentive staff. Easy walk to most neighborhoods or a short cab ride.  Easy 10 minute walk to the beach.  Loved the mornings slow paced breakfast with super sweet staff.,5,2019,09,07
18,Wonderful Find!!,"I did a ton of research in Barcelona.  I found The Serras.  So glad I did.  Location so convenient to the charming Gòtic and Born areas.  Close enough to all other sites.  Plus, amazing rooftop bar with gorgeous sunsets and evening views over the harbor.  Awesome intimate hotel and great restaurant and food.  Deck is intimate and a special section for hotel guests only.  Rooms are elegant and functionally modern.  Great design.  But, best thing is the worst detail staff.  They anticipate your needs.  So gracious and accommodating.  They really take the time to show you how to enjoy the hotel when you check in.  The Serras will be my go to Hotel when in Barcelona!!",5,2019,09,06
18,Perfect Hotel Stay!,"I am an incredibly picky traveller and The Serras exceeded my expectations! The staff was beyond amazing and helpful. No request was too small and they were a truly wonderful group of people. The food was delicious. Some of the best meals in Barcelona were on site- and for a food city, that is impressive! The 2 bedroom suite was perfect as well - worth every penny. My teenage son  had his own space and bathroom, the doors were heavy, so the room was very quiet, and the appointments were luxurious. We felt like we had a private apartment in the best location in Barcelona with lovely people who I was excited to see every morning. Thank you everyone at The Serras! I will recommend you highly and look forward to my next Barcelona visit!",5,2019,09,03
18,Birthday celebration stay at the Serras,"Excellent location and facilities. Staff extremely friendly and accommodating, wished we could have stayed longer than the 3 days we booked to celebrate our birthdays (Champagne in our room on arrival as a celebration drink)",5,2019,09,02
18,"Pure pleasure, indeed!","Everything about our stay was perfect.  The staff are magnificent, the rooms, the service and the food. Thanks, The Serras certainly go beyond..that is exactly what the world wide experience of travel should be like. Congratulations on delivering true five star service.",5,2019,08,30
18,ridiculous,"pretentious water saving sink with no facility to hold water.could only get hot water out unless the water was left to run for ages negating the original design to save water.An expensive,small room with the only view from the window of a small alley.
Staff great and food,especially breakfast,excellent.",2,2019,08,30
18,Incredible!!,"The Staff here at The Serras is absolutely amazing! They immediately made us feel welcome, and served us a glass of champagne to help us celebrate our honeymoon. We were given a tour of the amenities, rooftop pool and restaurant by Daniel, who shared a bit of Barcelona’s history and gave us tips on what we should see during our visit. Wonderful personal service, the staff is awesome, and the accommodations are breathtaking. Absolutely top notch place to stay!",5,2019,08,29
18,Super Boutique Hotel Experience,"Perfect stay in small boutique hotel.
Top Service and high level restaurant experiences.
Breakfast with personal touch, diner in restaurant Informal was sublime.
Rooftop pool en lunch area wonderful. 
Will be back !",5,2019,08,29
18,One of the best hotels I have stayed at,"The hotel is located in a prime position, opposite the seafront and nestled between the Gothic area and the famous Rambles Street. Rather than stand at a reception desk filling forms we were taken to comfortable sofas where a receptionist gave us each a glass of champagne and showed us on a map all the places of interest. We were then given an orientation tour of the hotel and shown to our rooms. One of the first things you noticed was the lovely aroma in the room. The large rooms were spotless and looked like new. The beds were large and very comfortable. High quality teas and coffees, bottled water and bottle of champagne were supplied free of charge. The air conditioning was simple to use and very effective. The lighting in the room was delicate and there was a large new tv.The WIFI reception was strong. The bathroom was large, fresh and exceptionally clean. The sinks were uniquely and tastefully modern. Throughout the hotel there was the lovely aroma and soft background music. We dined in the restaurant. The ribeye steak that I ordered was the best I've ever tasted. The glasswear and utensils were of best quality. Given the quality of the food and service, I felt the price of our meal was very reasonable. Breakfast was also of the highest quality with a good selection. This hotel is not cheap but if you are looking for a very special place to stay, you will not be disappointed. We shall definitely be going back there and I can't wait to savour some more of that ribeye.",5,2019,08,27
18,"Top of the line service, we will be back!!","My husband and I took a trip to Barcelona and it was recommended to us to stay at The Serras- and we couldn't have been happier. When we arrived after a flight from France, we were greeted as soon as we stepped out of our cab from the airport by Lorenzo. He was quick to help us with all of our bags and directed us to the front lobby to meet with Carolina.

Carolina works at the front desk and gave us a very impressive first impression (which lasted throughout our entire stay!) While meeting with her about the details of our stay, we were offered delicious cava, a fresh towel and some delicious chocolates with pomegrante seeds- so delicious! Shortly after, Carolina directed us to our room. We reserved a deluxe suite for the six nights of our stay and it was the perfect amount of space. With two balconies, a large size bed, walk in shower, nespresso machine and double closets- we couldn't have been happier. What was also wonderful was that Carolina shared with us that each morning we could stop at the front and request a reservation for lunch and dinner at the restaurant of our choice. This was such a nice way to plan each day. She also provided us with a print out of all the recommended restaurants in the area, along with their average prices and menu offerings.

Once we were settled, we headed to the El Sueno rooftop bar where we were greeted by the bartender and wait staff. I wanted to take this opportunity to give a special thank you to Gioanna, Alejandro, Reid, Marcello and Baia for top of the line 5 star service. My husband and I returned each day to the roofdeck bar in the morning, afternoon before dinner, and for a late night drink and with the service, amazing drinks and atmosphere- we looked forward to returning each and every time. The experience was made very cozy and intimate. The staff took the time to get to know us, and made us feel right at home (even though home for us was thousands of miles away)

The hotel was located in such a great area, walking distance to almost everywhere. We had a chance to also eat at Informal, one of the restaurants at the hotel and it was by far one of the best meals we had (and of course not to mention, the top of the line service)

The day we had to leave was a sad one for us, and the hotel was kind enough to pack us breakfast boxes to go. Diego, who is the front office manager was so helpful and kind in assisting us throughout our day and even up to our departure.

It is not often we go somewhere and start planning our return while being there, but my husband and I had already began discussing when we would be back to this hotel. Thank you to the team at The Serras for giving us the trip and experience of a lifetime. You deserve all the positive reviews and we can't thank you enough and look forward to being back!!!",5,2019,08,26
18,Very Enoyable Experience,"The staff was one of the most friendly and helpful hotel/resort staffs I have ever dealt with. The rooms are beautiful, clean and very comfortable. Despite being in a relatively busy part of the city, the rooms are very quiet due to sound proofing. The restaurant was fantastic. And the location within Barcelona is perfect. ",5,2019,08,26
18,"Amazing service, amazing food, amazing experience","We visited earlier in the year for valentines day. It was our first time visiting Barcelona, the staff were extremely helpful in there recommendations of places to go.

The service throughout our stay was wonderful and I will definitely return.
I'd like to thank the staff for helping make our holiday in Barcelona extremely special!",5,2019,08,22
18,"Fabulous location, 5 star guest experience","Ideal hotel location -walking distance to the beach, gothic and borne areas while avoiding the mayhem of the crowds. The abundance of welcoming and helpful staff 24/7 ensure a 5 star guest experience. Rooms are spacious- interior design with a modern, crisp and calming feel. Beds are heavenly! Elegant, modern roof top patio with small pool, serves fantastic and thoughtfully presented food. For foodies: don’t miss eating at the restaurant. The Michelin star awarded chef creates delicious tapas and entrees. 
So happy we stayed here! ",5,2019,08,15
18,Great location / great hotel,"The most outstanding staff experience we have encountered in a long time!!  We loved the rooms, location and amenities of the hotel.  The restaurant was outstanding!!  We will certainly recommend to friends and stay here on our next trip to Barcelona",5,2019,08,12
18,"Phenomenal staff, excellent stay",The staff is above and beyond the greatest.   The room was wonderful. The food was amazing. And the location is great for beach and city. The additional activities they recommended were all great. If you have kids that like to dance then strongly consider the flamenco lessons.  The Serras is really a special place. ,5,2019,08,10
18,Place to be,"Definitely the place to be. You can relax there, be easy like you always wanted to be. My favourite place to stay so far. I strongly recommend it to everybody in this world. I'm happy to be there!!! :)",5,2019,08,08
18,Relaxation,"Excellent experience and will definitely return. The staff was friendly,attentive and helpful. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. It’s located near the port and within walking distance to several restaurants. 
Even though the pool was small it was refreshing. ",5,2019,08,07
18,Great with excellence.,I told the people wandering if it is a good hotel or not. But I do know that this is a great hotel. The staff and so the service are really great and helpful for us having a couple of kids. So there are lots of rooms with great scenery with super view of sea. I always like Spain because it is in Mediterranean.,5,2019,08,05
18,Wonderful little boutique hotel,"Great location, impeccable service, delicious food and drink. The higher the floor, the better, face the water if possible. The concierge did a fabulous job organizing last minute details for us. The staff is flawless.",5,2019,08,03
18,Nice stay,"Loved the location of the Serras. Service from the moment of check-in to our departure the service was so friendly and inviting. We chose the Junior Sea Suite. The room was elegant and the room and bathroom were a generous size. A central table that hid a television did a nice job of separating the room when the TV was raised. They left us daily treats that were lots of fun. So many fun places in this hotel to explore - nice bars and rooftop deck. It was closed while we were there but they offered to serve us there anyway.  The ""sea view"" is a bit of a stretch but we could technically see a spit of water. Normally this would be a big deal but the hotel excelled in every other way. Our windows/balcony faced a very busy and loud street but when you closed the windows it was completely quiet in the room.",5,2019,08,02
18,Visit to Barcelona,"It is unfortunate that the highest rating is only a five. The hotel is gorgeous and in a perfect location. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant and the service was great and the food was outstanding. The absolute best thing about the Serras is the people. They are highly trained, very intelligent, and cannot do enough for you but most importantly genuinely nice people. This was probably the best overall hotel experience in 50 years of traveling. ",5,2019,08,01
18,great small overpriced luxury   hotel,"This nice place is all about the service!  It is really impeccable. If the price would be a little bitt  more moderate , this hotel would be a talk of the town..
The rooms without any view ( 303 ) are very dark and very small. The 360 Euro for a night is almost a robbery. Such rooms should be significantly cheaper!",4,2019,08,01
18,Impressive hotel experience in Barcelona,"We loved everything in this hotel from the moment we arrived: location, service, interior & food. We sure will be back next time we visit Barcelona. Make sure to spend a day by pool and visit the restaurant downstairs. ",5,2019,07,31
18,A lovely customer experience,"Very clean and well maintained small hotel, with welcoming and attentive staff.  The rooftop bar has a section for hotel guests, and our meal at Informal was perfect. Room was a little small, but comfy.",5,2019,07,30
18,Excellent hotel Barcelona,Excellent hotel. Superb staff. Great location. Rooms are great. Front desk organize any request efficiently and pleasantly. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. Rooftop bar and pool service excellent ,5,2019,07,29
18,Fantastic Hotel and Exceptional Service!,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights during a 30th anniversary trip to Europe.  We were treated exceptionally from the moment we checked in (welcome drink, tour of the hotel, overview of map of the city, etc) and had a lovely congratulations note and complimentary snacks and bottle of champagne in our room.  Each time we came and went from the hotel we were greeted by name and the concierge asked us about our stay and how he could help.  The room wasn’t very large, but very well stocked, modern and clean.  The breakfast was not included in the room rate, but we had it twice and it was excellent.  The hotel was in walking distance to many attractions, including the beach.  I do have to mention that there was one area we wandered into to find a restaurant that seemed sketchy, so like anywhere in Barcelona, be aware of your surroundings.  The concierge recommended a place called  Sensi that we would definitely recommend (make a reservation!), and we also ate at another good restaurant very nearby called La Dentelliere.  My husband really enjoyed swimming and lounging on the rooftop terrace, since I am a later sleeper than he is.  Everything here was top-notch.  It is a pricey place, but it exceeded our expectations and we would definitely recommend it.  They even left us a few bottles of water, some candies and a personal note in our car as we headed out.  Thank you for a fantastic stay!!",5,2019,07,28
18,Superb Staff,"Any hotel can provide superb amenities...not every hotel can provide superb staff and the service that comes with it. I was throughly impressed with the entire Serra staff, from our welcome reception that included chocolates and Cava, to the fantastic turn down service, to the welcome bottle of bubbly in our room. The Serra is a wonderful boutique hotel that sets itself apart from others by elevating the level of personal touches their staff provides. This is obviously a management directive as every employee we encountered smiled and made sure every detail or concern was immediately handled. The hotel itself is small but very adequate. The rooftop bar is amazing along with the wonderful servers. Carol made a really great impression on my wife. The pool is on the small side but adequate for a dip. We dined at the Informal, we weren’t a fan but this doesn’t detract from the hotel experience. The rooms are on the smallish side but they are opulent and well equipped. Comfy bed, large shower, mini bar and a really cool “cell”phone that you can take with you to make international calls and web surfing when you are exploring Barcelona...what a high end touch! The location is amazing, you are right in the Gothic quarter with a ton of bars and tapas restaurants. Check out was a breeze, we got call the night before to setup a wake up call and arrange taxi service...again these are world class service touches.
Pricing was on the high side but it was high season and in a great location. When you get service that exceeds price, this is the definition of value. Well done Serra team!",5,2019,07,25
18,People make it magical,"There are probably 5 hotels in the world where I would never look for an option when I travel to that place again; The Serras in Barcelona just joined that list. 

I've stayed at The One & W in Barcelona, across the board The Serras beats those hotels hands down. 

The hotel is located very centrally with many attractions within walking distance and yet on the marina, 

We had the most personal welcome from the Hotel Manager, Ona, I've ever experienced at a property,. 
The suite was wonderful, spacious, filled with all amenities I've seen in any hotel.

Sandra who works in the coffee shop made breakfast the best meal of the day. God Bless. 
Daniel who's at the front desk and the other girls who's names I don't remember (apologies, been a few days since leaving that I'm writing that review) will make exploring the city a pleasure. They went beyond the call of duty to make reservations, save us money and in general have an attitude that they work so you can enjoy your vacation. 
Airport pick up and drop was seamless.

This is't a big 5 start hotel. It's a small - medium sized family hotel with all the facilities of a big hotel where you're likely to find the friendliest and most efficient service. be warned, you might leave friends behind once you finish your stay.",5,2019,07,24
18,The epitome of service,"Having spent my entire career in hotel management, I have experienced a few small hotels as elegant, but none, of any size, with a staff so dedicated to serving their guests. I would suggest that anyone planning to visit Barcelona should seriously consider booking this perfectly located, flawlessly maintained, scrupulously managed boutique hotel and experience the epitome of hotel service.  You will not regret having done so!",5,2019,07,23
18,Wonderful Stay,"We stayed at The Serras for the first part of our tour of Spain, and loved the experience.  Perfect location, modern and comfortable room, and a wonderful breakfast.  Most important, the staff were phenomenal.  From Emma at check-in, to Aranya and Sandra at breakfast, the personalities and warmth of the staff were excellent.  Most of Barcelona was within walking distance of the hotel, and proximity to the airport was perfect.",5,2019,07,23
18,Perfect & Well Deserved Ranking,"Just perfect , exception service from The Serras Team. Congratulations to the management. Well trained staff and attention to details and ensure you and family feel welcome. Great location and good breakfast

18,Perfect!,"We loved our stay at The Serra’s.  Great location, beautiful decor, quiet room and lovely rooftop space.  Service was terrific, with a very attentive and knowledgeable front desk team.  Room service was fast.  The bed was the best I’ve slept in at a hotel!  ",5,2019,07,19
18,Perfect-The Serras,"It was our first visit to the city.Perfect Hospitality and service standards are touchwood, it’s awesome. A very nice touch and thank you.

18,Excellent Hotel in Gothic Area,You will not be disappointed if you stay here.  Staff are wonderful and always ready to help find something for us.  They gave us great tips on things to do.  Every day was the best treatment.  Perfect location.  Highly recommend.  That rooftop is the place to go in the afternoon for the drink of the day or just a glass of wine.  Will miss this place.,5,2019,07,18
18,Awesome! Could not recommend enough!!!!,"Bottom Line.  Absolutely wonderful. Truly amazing/professional staff. Rooms were comfortable, clean, and stylish. Perfect location. 

Longer Comment
Before CheckIn. My wife and I came here for the first leg of our honeymoon. Even before we got to the hotel, the staff was very helpful in recommending/arranging activities my wife and I were interested in (e.g., dinner rsvp, wine tour, and airport transport). The staff really made us feel as if we were family and always made sure we were comfortable. 

The Rooms. Super comfortable and clean. The bed/mattress was perfect (not overly firm or soft). The pillows were a bit squishy for me, but alas, they have a pillow menu! The pillow menu has options for all. I chose the Singapore pillow, but you have several options to choose from. Turndown service is twice daily (morning and evening) with a nice sweet treat left at the evening turndown service. 

Food/Restaurant. While my wife and I did not have dinner at the hotel, we had breakfast and lunch at either the lobby hotel or on the rooftop (which is beautiful, see below). Food and service was spectacular. 

Other amenities. Please do take advantage of the rooftop. Not only is there a nice soaking pool to relax and enjoy, but the food and drinks are a delight. Also, the views of the Mediterranean do not suck. 

Conclusion: If you are looking for a small boutique hotel that has a personal touch, delicious food, and is well situated amongst the other Barcelona neighborhoods, look no further. I can not recommend this hotel more strongly. ",5,2019,07,17
18,One of the best hotels in the world,"Everything at the Serras is worked out to the most minute of details! Perfection in every aspect. The services is top notch - professional, yet unimposing. The rooftop blends the best of big city vibes and a relaxing holiday atmosphere. The rooms, as the rest of the hotel, are extremely aesthetic. ",5,2019,07,15
18,Amazing Hotel!  Won't stay any place else!,"Without a doubt, this is the only hotel to stay at in Barcelona!  From the minute you walk in the door till you leave, every attention to you and detail is par excellence!  You are greeted with a cool drink, wash towels and a snack while checking in.  Alexandra, Sondra and Marjorie were absolutely the best!!!",5,2019,07,15
18,Great Hotel,Everything was great from the moment we arrived till we had left.. Highly recommended. The location was great being a walking distance to many places in barceloneta esp la Rambla and the gothic areas.,5,2019,07,15
18,A True Gem,"This was our first time in Barcelona. The location was perfect in a comfortably walkable city. The hotel was a wonderful mix of eclectic design and,high quality furnishings. 
Our sleep quality was great as the rooms are essentially soundproofed.
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff. This is a defining characteristic of a truly great resort, staff well trained, professional in appearance and manner. Emese of guest relations and her efficient colleagues just made our stay fantastic.
Among their great recommendations for dinner was Asador de Aranda. Fabulous steakhouse, in an exotic old mansion. One of the highlights of our stay.
We had breakfast most days at the hotel, since it was so inviting and the wait staff so friendly and accommodating.

18,"Great Hotel , dangerous city","Hotel Serras was beautiful. Expensive but backed by wonderful staff and facilities. Sadly we were mugged 100 metres from the front of the hotel in broad daylight . Every tourism related entity is trying to hide the fact that Barcelona has a massive street crime problem that is out of control. Please visit a local Police station to see hundreds of distressed tourists trying to report crimes to disinterested police . No cash, jewellery, watches on you outside. You have been warned , wish we were by the staff .",3,2019,07,05
18,Lovely little Hotel.,Since stepping into this place everyone has been warm and welcoming.  They have accommodated our requests which are very minimal to be frank.   They all speak English and are more than willing to assist.  There as has not been one person in this hotel not trying to help as some point or another.   It is the little things that matter.   I love to walk so it is also in a great location to all the local sites as well.   This is a gem.,4,2019,07,04
18,Nearly but not quite,"Amazing service and incredible food!  Rooms not up to standard for the price.  The staff were all extremely friendly, professional and helpful.  The breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks were faultless and very yummy.  Well located for Barcelona attractions and shopping.  This all being said the reality of the rooms is that they are not up to the standard (maintenance, size of room, cleanliness, bed, quality of finish) of the rest of the hotel, they definitely detracted from our stay.   This is based on my expectation of paying 400 to 500 Euros / night.",4,2019,07,04
18,Best hotel I have ever stayed in,Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The room and the service were amazing. The Michelin starred chef restaurant food was really good as well. We were made feel welcome from the moment we arrived to the very last,5,2019,07,03
18,Perfect stay,"We stayed for one night and we were not disappointed. The staff were all so friendly, helpful and accommodating from start to finish. The customer service prior to our stay and during was first class. Bedroom was very comfortable and clean, with superb views.  Breakfast was very tasty and plentiful. 
Lovely touches during our stay that were appreciated. The roof top terrace was incredible especially during the warm evening. 
Great spot for a stay prior to or after a cruise, as very close to cruise port. 
Overall, we would definitely recommend and stay again when we are next in Barcelona. 

Thank you all at The Serras.",5,2019,07,02
18,The Serras is a serene little oasis in beautiful bustling Barcelona.,"We had a terrific stay here. Staff is knowledgeable and always helpful. Rooms are stylishly elegant and chic although I wish there was more counter space in the bathroom. ( I can never have enough but the countertops and storage underneath the sink could have been more functional. The shower is the best we’ve found in any of our travels. Our deluxe King Room was quiet even though it faced the street and the Port.
Concierges were some of the best we’ve ever encountered and we had lots of requests and questiOur stay was enhanced by the entire staff whose philosophy is that nothing is too much for them to handle and they do this with grace and efficiency.
The location is close to everything and getting taxis are easy.  It’s easy to be captivated by this hotel and you’ll want to return as we do if you visit Barcelona.",5,2019,07,02

18,Wonderful Stay at The Serras,"We recently stayed at The Serras and could not have been happier with the experience. The service was exceptional - one stand out is Sandra at the lovely Informal restaurant. She went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and at home.

This was truly a wonderful stay- we can’t wait to go back!",5,2019,07,01
18,An amazing hotel,"My husband and I spent two nights at Hotel The Serras at the end of May and we had the most amazing experience. We have never experienced such kind people who made our first visit to Barcelona so memorable.

18,Excellent Hotel!,We stayed at the Serras hotel for 7 nights. Great experience - great location - the service is extraordinary. On arrival at the airport - driver was waiting - super efficient. At the hotel - we were met by Emma who took us through everything and monitored our entire stay! Alejandro on the roof top bar went out of his way to make our stay special - always remembered our names - and even in a very busy place managed to make you feel like a special guest! We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend La Serras!,5,2019,06,30
18,Great Visit,We stayed 4 nights at the Serras after a weeklong cruise.  The hotel is in a great location and a quick ride from the cruise port.

I strongly recommend using the rooftop area.The food is amazing and the views are lush. 

The staff are also very nice. They were always willing to help in any way they could. Everyone from reception staff to cleaners. I had a refreshing chat with a cleaner on one occasion, who told me his recommendations of places to visit. Little touches such as that really made my experience of Barcelona great. 

My favorite point regarding the hotel is not only the wonderful cleanliness, but its continuity throughout the hotel grounds. It seemed that absolutely everything was cleaned only five minutes before you viewd it, all the time.",5,2019,06,25

The Serras facilities are beautiful and immaculately maintained. Our one dinner we had at the rooftop restaurant was the best we had during the week.  We could hardly wait to wake up and enjoy the breakfast experience each morning. 
 
What truly sets The Serras apart from other hotels is the staff.  Every person we met was friendly, engaging and seemed truly happy to help us in any way possible.  
 
We spent five days at The Serras and we all agreed that the stay was the best hotel experience we have had.

18,Fabulous calm in heart of Barcelona,One of the very best hotels I've stayed in ever - fabulous staff to take care of every need.  Beautiful design throughout and rooftop spectacular.

18,Top notch boutique hotel,"If you are looking for a 5 star hotel, with a 5 star restaurant, and a 5 star staff look no further than Hotel The Serras.

18,Great stay in a first class boutique hotel,"We stayed at The Serras for two nights and the stay was wonderful. The location is very convenient to the Gothic quarter and the marina/waterfront area. The staff was very friendly and helpful, taking time to provide a detailed explanation of the hotel, describing and pointing out nearby sights on a map, arranging for dinner reservations and handling our baggage in a very timely manner.

The room was very nicely decorated with a comfortable bed and seating area. The view from our room was outstanding, overlooking the marina. And despite being directly facing a busy street, the room had excellent soundproofing.  

If we ever find ourselves in Barcelona again, The Serras will be our first choice for a hotel.",5,2019,06,17
18,"Great location, nice roof deck","Had a great time. Staff was amazing. Room was fine but on the small side. Bathroom was very large. Roof deck was a nice perk. Love the location.

18,"Serras, second home",The Serras is like coming home with a unbeatable level of treating their guests. General Manager Antonio and his staff do anything to make your stay unforgettable. Especially Sandra who even knows that I prefer cold milk for my cortado time after time year after year :-). You guys rock!,5,2019,06,16

18,An AMAZING Stay at The Serras,"The staff at The Serras are what make this hotel so extraordinary.  But there is one person who stood out to my husband, Bruce and I.  That is Sandra, the hostess at breakfast.  She greeted us every morning with the most gracious  smile, remembered our coffee and food preferences, and was genuinely interested in making sure our time in Barcelona was as enjoyable as possible.  She made  very helpful suggestions and even went so far as to try to get us tickets to Park Guell when the reception staff informed us the park was sold out for the day.  Sandra is one of the most lovely and personable women I met on our month-long travels through Spain.  She is absolutely an exceptional asset to the staff of The Serras.",5,2019,06,11
18,Amazing hotel!,"We stayed for two nights and did not want to leave! Gorgeous, Boutique hotel in a great location close to the waterfront. Our check-in was seamless and Carolina was so informative. The room was spacious and beautiful. Although on a busy street it was very quiet. Sandra the breakfast manager treated us like Royalty and is adorable. The rooftop bar provides breathtaking views and a swimming pool. We will be back!!!",5,2019,06,08
18,Beautiful Hotel with First Class Staff!,"My family of 4 arrived in Barcelona very tired and exhausted from traveling. From the moment we arrived, we felt welcome at this wonderful boutique hotel!

The staff went above and beyond to make sure our visit to Barcelona was a happy and memorable one.  I would highly recommen this property and I am sure that I will visit it again soon.  ,5,2019,06,07
18,Boutique perfection,"This hotel is our idea of perfection. We were traveling for our 30th anniversary and have stayed in many lovely hotels. We prefer a smaller boutique hotel over some of the more well know larger hotels. We are very picky, i admit, and this hotel exceeded our expectations. It is beautiful but in a very warm homey way, you just feel very comfortable. I am not exaggerating when i tell you that the service here is the best we have ever experienced! When you walk in there are two normal desks where you check in, there are always two people there and you never have to wait. They are there to call a cab, make a reservation, give directions, or anything else you need. Every time you come downstairs you are warmly welcomed. Our favorite staff member was Sandra, the breakfast (which is amazing) manager. She is so warm, friendly and accommodating, literally cant do enough for you. We also want to mention Carolina, Alexandra, and there was a young man whose name i dont recall that i want to give special thanks to. He even brought us 4 vacuum sealed bags of ice for our feet one day upon returning.  The bar/cocktail area with a small wading pool on the roof has amazing views and has a gorgeous view toward the harbor! We went up to relax and get a drink each day after touring, my husband also enjoyed a cigar which you can buy on site.
I could go on and on but i will just say that when and if we return to Barcelona we will absolutely come back to Le Serras!! 
PS: great pillow and mattress, great shower except no ledge for a woman to shave her legs.",5,2019,06,05

Fantastic service throughout hotel from check-in through check-out.  Didn’t try restaurant for dinner but very good breakfast with excellent service especially by Sondra. We are breakfast at hotel more than usual because of her.,5,2019,06,02
18,"Great location, almost everything is walkable","First time stay.  Easy check-in process.  28 rooms in total. So, if looking for large property this is not for you.  While central location, was quiet for most part at night as it’s not central to the night life.  Great and helpful staff who look to make your stay as pleasant and enjoyable as possible.  Rooms were spacious, bed was super comfortable with no break in necessary as both my wife and me felt we were sleeping in our own bed the first night.  Room was clean and kept clean throughout.  Plenty of towels - never needed to call for extra towels.  Unfortunately, only ate breakfast at restaurant so cannot comment on quality of dinner fare, but breakfast was good.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a boutique hotel that is well run, has great staff, and is in a great location.",5,2019,06,02
18,Boutique Heaven,Beautiful boutique hotel in the perfect location. Impeccable staff and service. Breakfast was just ok. But Informal restaurant lived up to Michelin rating. Wine pairing was wonderful. Room was luxurious with many amenities but when we got pillows off the ‘pillow menu’ they were still not firm enough. But the friendly staff and wonderful rooftop make up for anything lacking. Cava and the cava sangria are a must to drink. ,5,2019,05,31
18,A truly beautiful vacation. ,"From the first moment we walked through the door at Hotel The Sierras we were greeted by smiling faces and knew that our stay would be perfect. 

We can honestly say you made us feel at home as they made everything alright from the biggest thing to the smallest thing it was never too much.
The housekeeping staff went beyond the call of duty in however many calls asking for things like coffee capsules and they knew we liked our coffee and said don’t worry, we love our coffee too, and even followed it up with hot milk and that was a complete surprise as we didn’t want to bother them. 
I just want to say a huge thank you to you and everyone else.  
The roof garden staff were amazing as they were on call for any drinks or anything that we wanted so a big shout out to the bar members as you did a wonderful job. 
The reception staff we thank you for so many recommendations for the restaurants as you knew it was a big thing for us and would only send us to the best places and you certainly did, so never disappointed. 
Breakfast staff you were very professional each and every morning with a lovely breakfast meal in which you set us up for a lovely day in Barcelona making sure we were ready for the day ahead. 

So all in all I would like to say a massive thank you to the Hotel The Serras. We cannot thank you enough and we will certainly be back. ",5,2019,05,29
18,Wonderful,First time in Barcelona. Great Hotel with very attentive staff. The excellent cuisine and roof top bar was very enjoyable. Enjoyed the overall experience and attention to details. I can recommend it to lovers of boutique hotels. ,5,2019,05,29
18,Highly Recommended ,"So very glad that I picked this hotel for our first trip to Barcelona.  Couldn’t agree more with all the wonderful things that the other guests have said about the hotel. 

The location is perfect and we were able to walk to most places, enjoy the hustle and bustle of the Old Quarter, then return to our home away from home. Special thanks to all the staff here who made our stay truly wonderful.  

We also loved all the small touches such as the huge jar of sweets in the lounge and the smartphone that the hotel provides to its guests, which we came to rely on a lot to access Google Map.

18,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel is amazingly beautiful extremely clean very comfy bed great food. Fantastic roof top bar, great location & the staff are very friendly helpful that make you feel at home. I will definitely go back. ",5,2019,05,23
18,Great location and super attentive staff,Our travel agent recommended this hotel and he picked just the perfect place for us. We were able to walk everywhere easily within the old town area. Quiet and small but very friendly. Great rooftop bar and casual restaurant with helpful concierge service. We stayed in a suite which was more than adequate.,5,2019,05,22
18,Customer Service focused,"Friendly and accommodating staff. Clean, modern, well appointed rooms. Too cold and rainy for us to utilize but the rooftop pool, bar and restaurant extends the amenities outdoors.. Waling distance to harbor and beach. short walk to all downtown primary street and shops.",5,2019,05,20
18,"Stellar Service, Great Location!","We spent one week at The Serras, and had a very enjoyable and memorable experience! The staff are just lovely. In particular, Marjorie, who took great care and put forth so much effort to make sure we had the best possible dining experiences Barcelona has to offer. For example, she typically made three reservations per night, allowing us to choose which spot to dine. She truly made our trip even more enjoyable! The hotel was very clean and service was excellent! The roof top bar was also an added bonus, with its views of the Mediterranean. The Serras also has a great one star Michelin restaurant! The food was amazing. My only feedback (which, is truly minimal, because of the quality of service!) is that the restaurant would benefit from hiring a sommelier. Both times we dined at the restaurant, we had specific wine questions that could not be answered by staff. Overall, great hotel, great location, fabulous staff.... we will be back! ",5,2019,05,19
18,Amazing,"Absolutely incredible. Can't fault this hotel. From the staff to the rooms to the food to the location....it's all wow, wow, wow. Would highly recommend to anybody who appreciates the finer things in life and being treated like royalty :)",5,2019,05,19
18,Unfortunately missed the mark for us ,"We joined Hotel The Serras for five nights last week for the Grand Prix weekend. Having booked well in advance, we had correspondence with the hotel ahead of time about various needs and arrangements. With regard to my expressed needs for gluten-free due to Celiac disease, I was assured ‘all departments’ were informed. In terms of getting to the race, a car was booked. I inquired about tickets to area attractions (such as Sagrada Família), and I was told, via email, that the hotel would be able to help us get tickets upon arrival. They also asked if we were celebrating anything special, so I responded that we were: our 5-year anniversary with the Grand Prix. 

When we arrived, we were impressed by the lovely decor. Diego assisted us with check-in and was quite pleasant and informative. We had dinner on the rooftop—pricy, but good food. After informing staff of my gluten-free needs at the beginning of the meal, I was served ice cream with cookie bits; upon double-checking, once again, that they were gluten free, the attendant whisked it away from me and said they were not. Close call. Good thing I didn’t taste it. 

That evening, we returned to our room to find a small cake from the turndown service. My husband called reception and said, ‘These are gluten free of course, for my wife, right?’ And they said, ‘No they are not, but perhaps we could bring something else next time.’ They continued to put cakes on my nightstand. For three nights. Until my husband called again. Those of you with food allergies know the feeling that began to grow — the one where you feel you have to watch your back because nobody else is looking out for you. Some five star vacation. 

Fast forward to Sunday evening, at Informal. Along with the chocolate dessert, a scoop of ice cream was served to me AGAIN with the cookie bits. I double checked. I was first told ‘No no so sorry this is not gluten free.’ The kitchen was closing. Next thing I know, the waiter comes back and says ‘Yes, they are gluten free see this package?’ I wasn’t going to trust anything at this point, but after processing the first part, we thought to ourselves, aside from everything else, ‘What Michelin restaurant uses cookie bits from a CAN?’ The food was fine, but certainly not Michelin star. 

The next day, we expressed interest in La Sagrada Família. The young man in the foyer said, ‘For today? This will be complicated. This is why we recommend booking in advance.’ I grew hot with frustration. I HAD asked in advance, and I was told these tickets could be arranged when we got there. The front desk staff went online—no different than what we could have easily done with a Google search—and got us tickets for an undesirable late time the next day, with an air that this was lucky. To be clear, the staff was pleasant and it ended up fine, but it shouldn’t have gotten to this point. How could I have known, having never been to Barcelona, how far in advance? That’s why I asked. 

Not a huge deal, but that we were on our anniversary trip was not even mentioned. I don’t care in the least, but why make a special point to email us ahead of time and ask about special occasions? 

I should mention Diego apologized for the restaurant snafu. Though with one hand clearly not talking to the other in this place, I’m certain he didn’t know the extent to how many issues we had. 

When we went to pay the final folio, we noticed the car service rounded up to the full hour even though we used only the smaller part of a partial hour. Not a huge issue, but I wish I had been told of how things were charged. We have taken cars around Europe and this hasn’t happened yet—maybe it is how it works in Spain but it was annoying at the end of a disappointing stay.

The good part was some of the individual staff members. Sergio was an absolute sweetheart, and made it a point to chat with us about the race. He was wonderful with checking on us every time he saw us. Also a big shout out to the ladies working the breakfast. They were so very sweet. The eggs Benedict were great. 

Beds were nice, and the Handy in the room was nice too, but quite frankly these things are extremely secondary to people with Celiac disease/food allergies; traveling is a nightmare for us. The basics, such as the food and tickets were not taken care of in a five star way—and you can’t have a redo for special trips. Ultimately, I’m disappointed and hate that we paid as much as we did.   ",3,2019,05,19
18,Wonderful Experience,Everyone at The Serras makes you feel special. They help with dinner reservations and offering advice on where to sightsee. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a great location that is walkable to La Rabla and other key areas.,5,2019,05,14
18,A gem,"Excellent hotel on all counts.  Rooms are smartly designed and decorated.  Great bed.  We were in a junior suite with highly functional bathroom fixtures and enough room for two people to have their toiletries out.  Very quiet - From the experience of our traveling companions, rooms facing Passeig de Colom may be somewhat louder.  Highly recommended.",5,2019,05,13
18,Barcelona Grand prix,We flew in on Friday and stayed until monday. The hotel is in the gothic quarter and close to all amenities in Barcelona. Rooms are well appointed and we particularly liked the ability to open window doors to a step on balcony for fresh air and a view of the marina. It is a boutique hotel with 28rooms and at times this weekend it was difficult to get a seat at the roof top bar half of which can be used by non hotel guests. Staff were very helpful and friendly.I arranged 2massages while my family went to the formula 1 race. The masseuse attended the room and I enjoyed the well-being massage which was thorough.,5,2019,05,13
18,Excellent Small Boutique Hotel,"Very belated review, but looks like the service and experience is still the same as when we visited last year. As the other guests have said, its an excellent boutique hotel that is beautifully designed. We stayed for 4 nights in a Superior Room (Ciutat Vella View). It was smallish and of course didn't have a beautiful water view like the Deluxe Rooms, but nevertheless the room and bed were super comfy with all modern amenities. The welcome treats were a lovely touch. The rooftop pool was small but perfect and the location is excellent. We walked through the old town and down to the beach easily. The breakfast included was excellent. ",5,2019,05,12
18,"Fantastic location, hotel and staff!!!","For starters, the location is directly on the waterfront boulevard.  Our room had an impressive view out toward the ocean across the marina.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the Maltese Falcon yacht in the marina.  It is the third largest and most technically advanced sailboat in the world.  The hotel is small but the accommodations were the best we have encountered in our two weeks traveling Spain.  If you choose The Serras you will be pampered well.",5,2019,05,11
18,Great stay!,We stayed at the Serras for 4 nights in the standard room overlooking the street and across from the water. The room was quiet once we piped in while noise through the Bluetooth speakers which worked well for us. The room was nicely appointed with a couch and comfy bed. The staff could not be nicer!  Breakfast was included with our stay and the service of the waitstaff and lobby staff was exceptional. And the location was perfect for exploring. I would definitely stay here again. A true 5 star experience. ,5,2019,05,10
18,The perfect  Barcelona hotel,"The Hotel Serras was the perfect place to stay in Barcelona.  The location was right at the corner of Gothic and yet, being facing the sea, had the quietness away from the busy tourist area.  We loved that the hotel is smaller in size and relaxing which is needed after touring all day and ending at the rooftop bar with wonderful views and cocktails.   The rooms were spacious - Very Quiet and linens, amenities, etc. were excellent.  Most important is the staff.  The could not have been more friendly and helpful.  ",5,2019,05,07
18,Wonderful small hotel experience.,"Great location, delightful staff, thoughtful amenities and a terrific rooftop bar. Stay there when you are in Barcelona and able to splurge. 
We stayed two nights, our room was large, well-appointed and very comfortable. We did not have a water view, but did not miss it. Drinks on the roof before going are to dinner are a highlight, also a lovely mezzanine bar/lounge/library for a quiet retreat. Breakfast is fabulous, but not included in the room rate. They did allow us to split to overall offering on the breakfast buffet, so both price and amount of food ended up being reasonable (but not cheap)",5,2019,05,05
18,Great location...,"We spent three nights at the Serras.  We used their car service to and from the airport.  The staff was very friendly and helpful when we arrived late in the evening.  The gave us a glass of cava as we registered and had a bottle of cava in our room.  The gave us a quick tour of the hotel before showing us to our room.

The room was nice.  Not large but large enough.  It was comfortable.

We found the location good for us.  We walked a lot and also took the hop on hop off one day.",5,2019,05,03
18,Excellent holiday at the Serras!,You really need to try this place!  Perfect location and excellent service and food.  Our room was facing the street on the second level.  Could see some of the waterfront.  Very nice room  and all the amenities you could need. We only had 7 days in Barcelona but really needed more time.  When we go back we will stay here.,5,2019,05,02
18,Fabulous in every way,"Fabulous accommodation - the staff are so helpful and friendly, we would definitely stay here again.  Location is excellent, we walked everywhere from here. The accommodation is lovely, our room was excellent in every way, the bathroom was huge! Small pool on top deck too cold for us to swim in, but we enjoyed sitting up here looking at the view of the Harbour. ",5,2019,05,01
18,Excellent hotel,Excellent hospitality and services. Great location !! Definitly we recommend it to others. The hotel is close to La Rambla street and close to Barcelona port. Very frindly and welcoming staff and they are happy to help.,5,2019,04,30
18,Very good hotel,"We spent 3 nights at The Serras in February this year. 
Pros :
- Nice lobby and rooms. 
- Lovely rooftop
- Kind staff

Cons
- We got a room on a higher floor but no view (building opposite that was very close). I think it's probably best to get a room with a sea view...
- The staff is VERY young and not very professional although they were extremely sweet.
- We went quite a few times to get drinks on the rooftop...no staff there...or rarely...same at the bar on the first floor.
- Not a lot left to eat if you arrive for breakfast 20 mn before it closes...we asked for various things but they said there were no more !

But the lovely decor and atmosphere made up for all the negative points I guess.",4,2019,04,29
18,Wonderful,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at The Serras. I got sick, and they took such good care of me, it was almost better than being sick at home. Sandra the breakfast manager and the other restaurant and bar staff were especially great. The hotel really enhanced our trip to Barcelona.",5,2019,04,29
18,EXTRAORDINARY,"I have travelled the world and been lucky enough to stay is some of the worlds most beautiful hotels, but I have to say this is one of my favourite.  The staff are incredibly friendly, the service excellent. There is a Michelin star chef, who made me truly fall in love with food. The food was so exceptional my son and I did not want to go out to eat.  Even room services was exceptional.  If you have the pleasure of meeting Sandra, the utterly charming and helpful breakfast manager and waitress it truly icing on the case.  She is so lovely, helpful and charming you feel at home. The managers who I believe were a husband and wife team, were really lovely and do want  you to treat the hotel as your home away from home.  I wish there were more hotels like this. Kudos to you the Serras family, you have made your hotel wonderful with all the little additional touches and personal service.  If you enjoy a boutique hotel with charm, stunning surroundings, amazing food and great service, I could not recommend a place any higher.",5,2019,04,27
18,A notch above the rest,"This is the second time staying at The Serras and it was just as amazing as the first time. The service is truly phenomenal and the rooms are absolutely gorgeous. The beds are also one of the comfiest you will sleep in! The location is a close enough to the beach and on the edge if the gothic quarter with great restaurants just a stones throw away. If you get the chance, have a drink at the rooftop bar, you won’t regret it! Will definitely be back!",5,2019,04,25
18,We loved The Serras!,"We chose the Serras because of there reviews and location, and we were not let down.  The moment that we walked in we were made to feel welcome and important.  Every person on staff that we encountered during our 3 night stay was top notch!  We especially loved the warm, friendly personality of Sandra in the restaurant!  She made sure that breakfast each day was special!",5,2019,04,23
18,Brief visit to Barcelona-Apriln2019,"First class hotel at the heart of the town. Very friendly staff who gave us an introductory tour on arrival. Historical place where Picasso once had a studio.
Very good breakfast, exceptionally helpful restaurant manager called Brenda who looked after us. Clean modern and comfortable place.",5,2019,04,23
18,Excellent experience,"The Serras is ideally located on the waterfront in the Gothic Quarter. It is easily walkable to many attractions and if you can't walk, there are always taxis available right out the front door. We were upgraded upon arrival due to our travel agent mentioning it was our honeymoon. We had a lovely and spacious suite facing the water. Too bad we don't like taking baths, since there was a large and luxurious soaking tub included in the suite. 

We found the service to be impeccable. We were welcomed with a glass of cava or juice. There was also a bottle of cava and chocolate treats waiting for us in our room to congratulate us on our wedding. My husband loved the pillow menu since we have very different preferences for pillows. The breakfast buffet and service were also lovely. Definitely recommend enjoying a drink up on the rooftop lounge where you can enjoy the view.

Noise in the evenings was sometimes an issue due to the location and the popularity of the rooftop bar.",5,2019,04,22
18,True professionalism in every way,"We arrived at the hotel at 8am; too early to check in.  However, the staff already knew our names and they helped orient us with the city with a map and a highlighter.  The location of this hotel is superb if you want to be within walking distance of the old town, the Ramblas, the Picasso Museum and the pier.  Once in the room we were thrilled with the modern design and the Cava soaking in the ice bucket.  The room was ultra-clean and, even though we had a balconied window onto the street, the sound of the street was barely audible.  We loved the bed with the Hypnos mattress, you know, the one preferred by Queen Elizabeth!  There is a buffet breakfast available but we opted for a continental breakfast and it was delicious.  There is a rooftop bar and a tiny pool and also there is a quiet library area to just relax.  I understand Pablo Picasso himself had his first studio in this very spot!  Most laudable however, was the staff.  Friendly and attractive professionals all, they answered all of our questions, gave perfect recommendations for meals, and helped us retrieve a forgotten cellphone as we were departing Barcelona.  They can count on us being return customers.  This is an excellent hotel in every way.",5,2019,04,22
18,Simply perfect,"The Serras is an absolute gem in this wonderful city. Beautiful building & rooms, comfortable common areas (lounge, roof top). The food at the restaurant (El Informal) is one of the best meals we've ever had. Room was spacious & lovely, nice to have our own balcony. But the best part is the people who work there - extremely helpful and welcoming - always ready to do whatever is needed to make your stay & your experiences in the city fabulous!! Cannot speak highly enough. Stay here - you'll love it!",5,2019,04,20
18,Fabulous welcome to Barcelona!,"Great Hotel in a convenient location. Staff and service were exceptional, and the food was amazing! Room was a little small, but very clean. Bed was comfortable and the sheets were good quality. Nice size bathroom with 2 sinks and a good size shower with great water pressure. Highly recommend!",5,2019,04,18
18,Well deserved rating ,"Great hotel, couldn’t really fault it!
A good location, on the edge of the gothic area, across the road from the harbour. Staff very good and could not do enough for you. Roof top bar well worth a visit, perfect for a late afternoon drink. Rooms spacious and well equipped, fantastic shower. If I had to find something to be critical about then feel breakfast should be included for the price, however still paid for it every day(€29 per person) and enjoyed it! ",5,2019,04,18
18,Haven in Barcelona ,"Loved our stay in Hotel The Serras! Great rooms with jacuzzi tub and conditioning oil shower treatments. Nice perks!
A really knowledgeable bartender made us great cocktails on the roof top by the pool over looking the marina.
You  can have food or drinks 24/7 in the salon on the 1st floor.
Will for sure stay there again for our next trip to Barcelona!",5,2019,04,18
18,I love this hotel,"My sister and I stayed at the lovely Serras hotel a week ago and enjoyed every moment.  From the first, we met Maima and Sergio who were so warm, attentive and welcoming on our arrival.  It was our first time in Barcelona and Maima gave us the most thorough introduction to this beautiful city highlighting all the places we may want to check out and offering to book us tickets.  Sergio was equally helpful and gracious by making sure we were comfortably settled in.  The room was very comfortable and the bathroom is awesome (loved the shower!).  The room has its own cell phone which I really enjoyed having and the turn down service included a sweet treat which I thought was a nice touch.  The rooftop area, like the rest of the hotel, is charming and relaxing.  On top of all this goodness, the location can't be beat.  The  Gothic Quarter ended up being our favorite part of Barcelona and having a hotel right there was amazing.  What more can I say?  The staff, the room, the restaurant (Informal was delicious) all delightful.  As a woman who often travels solo, I would come back here in a heartbeat.",5,2019,04,17
18,a friendly stay with a touch of class,"We enjoyed everything , starting from the soft and quiet sleeping just some meters away from Barceloneta, the Picasso Museum, the main Cathedrals  and the Ramblas. And with a lovely Rooftop for nice drinks and relaxing. It couldn't be more..perfect !",5,2019,04,17
18,The Emperors new clothes?,"The Serras is a smart, spotlessly clean hotel with a near perfect situation by the port. We stayed in February 2019.
It's rather like Stella Artois beer in that it is reassuringly expensive but actually, that's kind of where the similarity ends as the consistent quality fo the former is not matched by the latter.
Yes, staff are very welcoming but as soon as you've paid up or declined the exorbitant cost of an in-house breakfast the welcome fades. The gym is nothing more than a sweaty walk in cupboard with little to really qualify it as a gym at all; certainly not if you're even remotely serious about working out. 
The bedroom was wonderful, huge, comfortable, spotlessly clean beds with white bedding but our room faced the wall of the next door apartment block, so not so great. However, the upstairs terrace is fantastic, especially at dusk and, one imagines, especially on warm summer evenings.
It felt more like an executive hotel where one was kind of being processed if I'm honest, rather underwhelming, but then I was kind of underwhelmed by Barcelona (sacrilege!) so I guess that puts me in the minority of people.",3,2019,04,14
18,Excellent hotel in amazing location in Barcelona!,"Great experience with the hotel. I would recommend the Serras to all of my friends and family. It’s in a great location and has wonderful amenities. The beds are absolutely amazing - you literally never want to get out of bed because they’re so comfortable. The only quip is that because we landed so early, we obviously arrived to the hotel early. I’m sure if I called and notified them that our flight was going to land early, maybe we could have been accommodated. Having to figure out what to do for 6 hours when you’re terribly exhausted sucks, to put it simply. I know they tried their best to have our room put together ASAP.  But other than that, we had a wonderful experience - beautiful hotel with amazing staff. Not much more you can ask for. ",5,2019,04,13
18,We would return,"This place gets five stars even taking into account my Mr Grumpy comments that I'll leave to the end. My wife rates it as best she has stayed in. She googled boutique hotels in Barcelona as we were doing a two city trip and wanted to stay somewhere different when we returned to Barcelona. I booked over the phone with guest relations who are excellent and a credit to the hotel. They let us leave a couple of cases there whilst we went elsewhere. On return fantastic welcome and cases already in the room waiting for us. On leaving, once again a personal goodbye that makes you feel valued. In the middle, great touches with the personal welcome card, chocs, amuse bouche and cava in the room. Free bottles of  excellent water at night. For the daughter enough plugs in the room for all devices and excellent wi fi. For the oldies, big bed, enough pillows and a great mattress and sufficient towels so that even the daughter couldn't exhaust them. The only place that recognised there were three of us and she might want a bathrobe to herself. Best shower (voted by us all) since the London Savoy. When they tell you the Aircon/heater is truly silent, it is and it works very well. Triple glazing keeps the outside noise to a minimum and the only noise I noticed from one of the busiest roads in Barcelona was from emergency vehicles. Good restaurant on site, a bit pricey but nothing that is shocking. It is after all a five star hotel with an excellent chef.  Extensive and for the most part reasonable value wine list. Nice bar up top on the roof with a small pool which is probably quite nice if the temperature is more than we had. Good views over the Port Vell and a great location. Mr Grumpy wonders if there would be enough drawer space for a lengthy stay, didn't like the modern sink and having the characteristics of a Gewürztraminer grape explained to him. Otherwise, this is one hotel the family will want to return to. Most enjoyable.",5,2019,04,12
18,This hotel is the BEST!,"We stayed at the Serras for 3 nights for Partners 40th birthday. The hotel is perfectly situated in the gothic quarter by the port. It is a small and intimate hotel.
From the minute that you arrive at the hotel you are made to feel like you are the only guests there. The customer service is excellent. Everything about this hotel is excellent! After a glass of Cava and a refreshing towel to freshen up we were ready for a tour of the hotel. 
The roof Terrence was perfect, it’s a shame it wasn’t warm enough to use the pool but it’s a good excuse to go back! We would head to the rooftop bar every evening for a cocktail before heading out. 
The room was beautiful, we were unable to find fault with anything. It was nice to have a bottle of chilled Cava waiting for us. The phone that you can take around town with free internet and international calls is a nice touch.
The last evening we ate at the Restaurant, the food was by far the best food that we had during our stay. My partner is an Executive Chef so I know when he is super impressed it must be very good! It’s nice that you can see in the kitchen during service to see the Chefs preparing the food. 
Everything about this hotel was perfect, this is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed in. It definitely deserves the excellent reviews. We will defiantly be back! Thank you to everyone for making our stay so special (especially Emma!) The only problem that we have is now we will compare anywhere we stay to the Serras! 
",5,2019,04,12
18,very good,"We absolutely love our stay. The whole hotel is super clean and modern, well maintained, very strong wifi, lots of hot water, the first time we saw face clothes in Vietnam, the TV was great and many staff were waiting",5,2019,04,12
18,Excellent Hotel!,"Hotel staff was very friendly and courteous. Restaurant was amazing. Beds were fit for royalty!  As I travel extensively, this hotel was one of my top stays. The rooftop is a nice getaway. It’s open 24 hours for snacks and beverages. ",5,2019,04,10
18,Amazing hotel in the middle of it all,"Comfortable beds, wonderful food and hospitality that cannot be beat! This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in across all of Spain - everything from helping us secure futbol tickets to getting us more of the wonderful chocolate nouget they gave us on check in (seriously - it is AMAZING and made in house) was perfect and without incident. We were able to walk almost everywhere (minus the stadium) but if we wanted a taxi, it was easy to get one quickly. I reccommend this to anyone in Barca - it is absolutely worth the splurge.",5,2019,04,09
18,Wonderful experience!,"We had such a wonderful stay at the serras hotel. The location, quality, and comfort of the hotel were all fantastic. Most impressive were the staff, who were all incredibly attentive and polite. Would highly recommend staying here. ",5,2019,04,09
18,Wonderful Experience-A World Class Hotel you MUST try,"We have traveled all over the world and this Boutique Hotel is at the top of our list.  We had 6 adults and booked 3 rooms.  Prior to our arrival,  we had worked closely with the concierge staff to arrange our visit details.   They were just amazing to work with.  They helped us with recommendations and reservations and made us feel like we were their most important guests.   This is hard to find in the hotel business.  We were pleased with all of their help upfront.  Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted by Rodriquez who was very professional and friendly,  and made us feel welcome immediately.  Next we met in person with the concierge staff.   They were just as wonderful in person.  Every detail was taken care of for us.  The manager of the hotel also came over to welcome our whole family.  The hotel is clean and beautiful,  rooms are wonderfully decorated,  and the hotel is in a perfect spot near the water.   We also need to say great comments about the restaurant and the bar.    Every morning our breakfast was incredible.  The breakfast manager could not be nicer.   We were there for several days and she remembered what each of us liked ( coffee ,  tea or other ).   This sort of detail was noticed by everyone.   At the top of the hotel is an amazing bar.  They have a wonderful view of the harbor that should not be missed.   To be honest we loved this hotel so much and felt like we got to know the entire staff.   You MUST try this hotel.  We want to thank them for everything they did to make our stay in Barcelona amazing.   We wish you would open up more hotels around the world.   We left Barcelona and went on to Lisbon and stayed at the Four Seasons there.   We Immediately missed the service we had at the Hotel Serras.  The Four Seasons was a let down after staying at the Hotel Serras.  You all deserve the 5 star ratings and much more!!",5,2019,04,07
18,Top notch!,"My family and I recently stayed at The Serras Hotel in Barcelona for 4 nights.  The staff was extremely professional and attentive, from the concierge to the ladies at the front desk to the cleaning staff.  The hotel itself was immaculate and the location was terrific.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a true 5 star experience!",5,2019,04,06
18,Fabulous Boutique Hotel,"From the moment the door was opened for us to the moment we left we felt like special, honoured guests. The attention to detail and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional. Breakfast was wide ranging and delicious. The rooms were clean, contemporary and a quiet oasis. The rooftop bar was a relaxing and fun setting.",5,2019,04,06
18,Incredibly friendly staff at a great location.,"The staff do The Serra May be the most friendly and helpful you will find at any small hotel in Europe. The front desk crew is very competent and alsway has great suggestions for restaurants and bars, especially in the El Born district just around the corner. The guy at the door is simply the best, genuinely friend,y, competent, great manners, smart. A hotel couldn’t wish for a better calling card. Rooms are nice and tasteful. The location is just perfect - at least for us. Right there where the historic city center meets the seafront. You are between hustle of the narrow medieval maze and breath of fresh air from the marina. The beautiful El Born district is just a five minute walk away, in ten minutes you can stroll on the Rambla. To the airport it is 30 minutes max.",5,2019,04,01
18,Wonderful Boutique Hotel,"We stayed at the Serras Hotel during a recent visit to Barcelona. What a charming place!! The service was excellent in all aspects. The hotel itself is charming, and the rooms are great. The restaurant was very nice. The hotel location is perfect for exploring the waterfront and the Gothic district. We would stay at The Serras again if we return to Barcelona.",5,2019,03,31
18,Fantastic hotel and excellent customer service - top marks,"What a delight of a hotel and a highlight was definitely the customer service from the moment we arrived, to the moment we left.  A wonderful greeting, with hot towels to clean up with, tea/coffee/ cava and home made chocolate squares.  We were given a short tour of the hotel amenities and then taken to our room.  Good size room, lovely and quiet (no view of the sea, but that means no traffic noise), the most comfortable bed and pillows ever, and a glorious shower.  Fabulous food in the restaurant, great cocktail back on the top floor. A great location for strolling along the promenade and the beach, strolling up La Rambla, visiting the old parts of the city and getting to the major attractions. ",5,2019,03,24
18,One of the best hotel experiences I’ve ever had,"From the moment we stepped in the front door till the moment we departed, The Serras was the ultimate boutique luxury hotel experience. The staff were so kind and thoughtful, assisting us when we needed some extra help. 

The room was cozy, calming and comfortable and everything was impeccably clean. We spent a few hours lounging on the secluded rooftop terrace, soaking up the sun rays. When it started to cool off, they brought us blankets. I can’t recommend The Serras enough. 

I will definitely stay again should I find myself in Barcelona. ",5,2019,03,23
18,Great Hotel to stay,"The Hotel was just Great. The staff (professional and friendly), modern and cosy design, quality of materials used, smell of the Hotel, just everything perfect. 

100% recommended.

Thank you for this great experience :)",5,2019,03,21
18,Short break,"Perfection from start to finish.
Staff on arrival were willing to assist in recommending sites to see, places to go and the best eating places.
They spent time with Barcelona map highlighting the sites.",5,2019,03,21
18,The Serras. Staff 5 stars. Sandra 10 stars,"Our family of four adults stayed here and cannot say enough about the hotel, staff, service , and comfort. We felt as if we were part of the family. From the front desk to the Bellman , Sergio, everyone was continually offering their assistance- dinner reservations, calling cabs exvellent service, directions , and just accommodating our every wish. 
We particularly want to mention Sandra in the restaurant. What a consummate professsional who was incredible! She took care of us like we were her cousins! She has a personality extraordinaire and always strived to keep us perfectly pleased. She was a joy. 

Andrea in the 6th floor bar was wonderful too. 

I highly recommend The Serras and hope to return again one day.",5,2019,03,20
18,Great hotel,We stayed here for a long weekend during our first visit to Barcelona. The hotel is in a great location and the interior is lovely. The staff are all really helpful and the rooftop is a great addition to enjoy the sun! Would definitely recommend a stay here.,5,2019,03,19
18,Excellent in Every Way!,"Excellent service before we even arrived by offering a car to pick us up from the airport which was extremely accommodating!  Such a welcome when we checked in with a special fuss of bottle of sparkling wine & small eats by Diego the duty manager!  Such personal attention was amazing!  The room, amenities and bed were outstanding!  Food & service at the restaurant superb!  I cannot day enough how much we loved staying here!  Highest recommendations!!!",5,2019,03,17
18,Truly Excellent,"I travel abroad quite often recently and usually choose hotels by referring to customer reviews in various sites such as TripAdvisor and hotel booking sites.  Ant this hotel, the Serras, is truly beyond my expectation.  From the arrival to the departure, my wife and I had been completely satisfied with the high quality of services provided, clean and modern facilities and people of the hotel.  All the staff we met seemed young but they were always warmly smiling and welcoming, attentive and helpful for us.  They even celebrated my wife's birthday by giving us surprise birthday cake with a hand written birthday card and a bottle of Sparkling wine.  My wife was so happy with this surprise and so was I.  If you are looking for a hotel which is friendly but has high professionalism, this is it.  The hotel location is also good, close to many sightseeing sites, metro stations and the marina; we really enjoyed walking around the hotel.  My wife and I appreciate great time provided at this hotel, THANK YOU.",5,2019,03,17
18,Lovely Stay,"I found the staff at The Serras incredibly welcoming and friendly and helpful.  They really made our stay special.  The rooms were comfortable and quiet, the location was great - on the edge of the Gòtic but with the light and spaciousness of Passeig de Colom permeating the the lobby, Restaurant, and rooftop spaces.  Nothing stuffy or pretentious, but beautifully designed with a modern fresh decor.  ",5,2019,03,14
18,Incredible Hotel,We can’t say enough positive things about this beautiful hotel.  From the moment we stepped into the lobby we felt like we were stepping into an oasis. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help us. The food was so good that we dined in every night after spending an exhausting day exploring the city.  ,5,2019,03,14
18,Wonderful experience ,"We just returned from our second stay at The Serras. They welcomed us like family. The customer service is the BEST. 
Everyone is exceptionally friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and goes out of their way to make you feel like you’re at home. At the end of the evening, the doorman/front desk always asked us about our day- remembering where we went for sightseeing or dinner. The recommendations are always fabulous-including restaurants, tours, and museum tickets. 
Highly recommend this beautiful boutique hotel in a fabulous location in the heart of Barcelona. Clean, modern, upscale, and relaxing. Thank you for a memorable visit! ",5,2019,03,13
18,Very enjoyable stay in Barcelona,Excellent staff and level of service (room and food). Great attention to detail and friendly athmosphere. The hotel is very well located. Rooms are very well equipped and provide a very good sleep quality. Excellent breakfasts. Very good restaurant. ,5,2019,03,12
18,Employees Make the Difference,"I stayed at The Serras for three nights with a friend in a Grand Deluxe room, which had been recommended to me from a travel writer friend of mine. We had pre-arranged pick up from the airport thru the hotel and it went smoothly. (We used a taxi on the way home and it was fine.)

Upon opening the front hotel doors they welcomed us, “Welcome Mrs. M....” which is a nice touch and a bit surprising. You sit at a desk and check in and they brought us a drink. They went over our room options and took a cell number to call when our was ready. They did ask if we’d like to upgrade to — room for € more per night and I can’t think of a time recently at a hotel at this level that just didn’t automatically upgrade you (“we’ve upgraded you to our — room”) or just left as is. Felt a little weird. 

The room was nice, pictures are accurate, small balcony, bathroom is amazing with large marble shower, separate toilet and double vanity. Great for two women sharing. The twin beds are European so they are smaller than American twins. Plush linens and nice pillows. They leave two glass bottles of filtered water and a treat in the room each night. Housekeeping is excellent.

A few negatives which almost made Serras a 4* - our room was loud due to it being connecting. I had requested a quiet room. You could hear every word from the people next door and they were a big chatty group enjoying themselves. Called for ice and they would bring two glasses, not a bucket. Our blue velvet sofa had a big questionable cream stain that looked like they didn’t even try to get out before we checked in. We finally put towel over it. I know what you are thinking ask them to move you; I agree. We were going to but it was the second day/night it was bad with our neighbors and we had one day left —packing up, ugh. We were hoping the people next door would check out. They didn’t. Serras could also have more outlets right by the bed instead of by the desk.

The employees at The Serras are excellent, being kind, patient and offering tons of excellent suggestions for restaurants, bars and sites around Barcelona. They really make the hotel 5* and a reason to return.",5,2019,03,06
18,Great boutique hotel!,"Fantastic service (a nice little touch with the cava and chocolate on arrival & the frequent top  ups of sweet treats in the room), comfortable bed (same brand of mattresses as those used in Buckingham palace apparently!) and lovely rooftop bar (former studio of Pablo Picasso which is a fun fact and makes it a little more special). The hotel was close to the main sites, including the Gothic Quarter, and I was able to explore almost everything on foot. Breakfast buffet is a little pricey but nice. Might be worth doing the buffet one morning and going a la carte the rest of the mornings if you prefer to eat in.

All in all - Glad I stayed here and I’d highly recommend it!",5,2019,03,04
18,Wonderful Hotel on the Edge of Gotico,"While perhaps not deserving of being TripAdvisor's number one hotel in Barcelona (I still think the Mercer is a tad better), the Serras is certainly worth of its 5 star rating and is a beautiful hotel you will be very happy to visit.  The quality of the service is exceptional, with the friendly staff eager to please and helpful with anything you ask of them.  The breakfasts, which are included, are a wonderful way to start the day, and served downstairs in a restaurant across from reception.  They also have a beautiful roof deck/bar that you will want to visit.

Their rooms are particularly spacious, with luxurious linens, large bathrooms, and king sized beds.  Although they are very well soundproofed, the low floors can get a bit noisy, as it is located on a street with a lot of foot and vehicular traffic.  However, the hotel is relatively new and modern, and you will be very comfortable there!

Although the rooms are bigger at the Serras, I personally found the experience at the Mercer to be a bit better, mostly because it is in a more historic building in a slighly better location, and has a touch more charm.  However, this is more a matter of taste and you will be thrilled to stay at either!",5,2019,03,04
18,"Marvellous service , location and food. ","Stepping into The Serras, was like stepping into the front lounge of some great friends who just happened to live in the best location in Barcelona. How fortunate for us! 

The staff were awesome from the start - my wife and I had little time to plan our trip and so we welcomed the opportunity to plan our whole 3 day trip in 30 minutes with such knowledgable local people. The recommendations made were spot on excellent. We made bookings for the Gaudi masterpiece - Sagrada Família, tapas at LLamber in the born district,  the Picasso exhibition , paella  at Barceloneta and all in the comfort of arm chairs and over a few glasses of cava. 

We upgraded the hotel room to a junior suite which was efficiently cosy and  the bed does feel like you are sleeping on a cloud! 

Breakfast was good and the Saturday night dinner was of Michelin star quality from beginning to end . The 6 th floor bar had great views over the marina and the bar staff were very happy , efficient and delightful serving me the best cognac in front of warming fires at midnight under the stars as well as welcoming our friends as if we owned the pad. 

Every member of staff ( say 30 people ) make this hotel one of the best in the world. A boutique hotel is extra special because of its staff - large hotels like the W and the Art hotels ,which we looked at for this trip , clearly have more facilities but also many people to serve . Whereas and  the staff at in The Serra are able to give you loads of time and attention which made our trip to Barcelona memorable,relaxing and exciting. The staff are quietly going about their business of bringing you happiness and tip top service they are not intrusive , over bearing in any way. They are just enjoying being part of the Serra and bring you joy - they are a brilliant team like Barcelona FC ! 

We also went to the market on the Ramblas  for late afternoon tapas , the Joan Miro and Nacional de art museums which were both excellent . 

We had a fabulous three days which was made from beginning to end by the staff of the hotel. We were welcomed like old friends on leaving and arriving back in the hotel. It was like an oasis of calm from the excitement of the old town. 

We will be back many more times. 

",5,2019,03,04
18,Everything a boutique hotel should be.,"We had a wonderful stay at the Serras Hotel in Feb 2019. This is a true 5 star hotel, both in terms of the quality of the rooms/property and as well as the excellent services they provide.

Highlights: (1) beautiful modern rooms, that retain a distinctly Spanish feel; (2) wonderful breakfast buffet served in the same area as their Michelin started resto - thank you Nina and Karn for the incredible attention you gave us each morning; (3) fantastic recommendations and help from the front desk staff - particularly Sergio who is always going out of his way to offer assistance and is supremely friendly.

Constructive feedback: (1) I think they need to have a dedicated door person at all times - the front desk girls do their best to run to help open doors, but it’s awkward.

Will definitely be back when we return to Barcelona!",5,2019,02,25
18,Exquisite Service,"Just returned from. Week long stay at The Serras. We had the LOVELIEST time at the hotel. I’ve stayed at a lot of hotels, and travelled all over Europe. The staff at The Serras honestly bent over backwards for us the entire trip. Their friendliness and warmth started from the moment we checked in until the moment we left. Jan, the concierge, opened every door, brought me anything I needed. I checked in and he plied my mom with mimosas. He greeted us warmly every time we saw him, it was like saying hello to an old friend. Sandra, who ran breakfast, REMEMBERED WHAT WE LIKED TO DRINK and had it set out for us the very next day! One evening it was a little chilly on the rooftop, and the barman (I wish I remembered his name!!) pulled over extra heaters for us so we’d be comfortable. The view from the roof is tremendous. The restaurant, Informal, is absolutely worth eating at. The room was spotless. Turn down service was great. The girls who checked us in had books ready for us to peruse and borrow. My brother sent me on a wild goose chase for craft beer and the girl at the front desk emailed me locations I could buy it at. You name it, we got it. The location was fabulous. There isn’t another hotel I’d consider staying at in Barcelona. Eixample was a bit of a walk, but I’d rather get lost in the maze of El Born and the Gothic Quarter myself. Do yourself a favor, stay at The Serras. You won’t regret it! ",5,2019,02,25
18,Exceptional,Everything about this hotel was fantastic. The service & staff were the best I have experienced in any 5* hotel. My choice of coffee was waiting for me as I left at 5am!. Would be my first choice of hotel in Barcelona in the future.,5,2019,02,25
18,Good choice in BCN,Room was good and Reception/lobby staff was excellent. Great location too.   Erratic housekeeping staff.  (End of review).   (Just typing crap now because TA requires minimum amount of text which is stupid and annoying.),5,2019,02,23
18,Modern Luxury in Classic Barcelona Style,"This hotel is simply stunning and offers a true 5 star experience from the moment you walk in the door. The staff was so nice and helpful. The rooms are clean, minimal, and very comfortable. The bed felt like sleeping in a cloud! Be sure to try the cocktails on the rooftop bar - they're superb. Breakfast was amazing as well. One of my new favorite hotels. Definitely worth the stay, you won't regret it!",5,2019,02,23
18,"progressively, quite recomadable service.",I had a chance to spend my weekend at this hotel. after the service and the entire treatment i decide to make a decision of visiting this hotel again . they are clean and most of offer the most healthier food ever tested within the city.,5,2019,02,22
18,Spectacular Service!,"We cannot day enough about our experience at The Serras Hotel. The service is absolutely outstanding- the BEST I have ever experienced- we were welcomed in the lobby upon our arrival with friendly smiles and offered glasses of cava as we checked in. The concierge JAN, was so helpful and went above and beyond to help us and make us feel at home every day! SANDRA, our breakfast manager in the restaurant was so sweet and treated us like royalty. We would definitely recommend this hotel to any of our friends traveling to Barcelona- it is in a great location and the service is unparalleled!",5,2019,02,21
18,WONDERFUL TRIP TO BARCELONA,"We have just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel Serras in Barcelona and have only praise for the hotel. This beautiful boutique hotel is situated opposite the marina and is in the ideal location between the sea and the city. From the moment we arrived at reception we were greeted warmly by Alexandra and offered a glass of Cava & chocolate - just want we needed after a long journey!! All the staff throughout our stay were extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to accommodate us. The breakfast every morning was delicious and very tastefully presented - and we have to say that Sandra the breakfast manager was very efficient, charming and a real asset to the hotel - always smiling and knew what we wanted without us even asking her. Another mention should go to Jan who seemed to be everywhere doing different jobs & always very helpful. It was an absolute pleasure to stay at the hotel & we would not hesitate to recommend it.",5,2019,02,21
18,Perfect in every way. An exceptional value.,"Everything was splendid, great location, great room, great staff, great food, I can’t say enough to express how wonderful the Serras was. Clean, well trained staff, they were very eager to help. Loved it ",5,2019,02,21
18,Comfortable stay for some relaxing days in Barcelona,"The Serras is the perfect place for staying some days in Barcelona. It is absolutly comfortable and it is located very central to the old harbour, the born and the gothic city. The staff is really friendly and helpful.The food and the service is excellent. We enjoyed our stay a lot and can recommend the hotel. ",5,2019,02,18
18,5 Star hotel 7 star customer service,"Excellent one of the best 5 star hotels I have stayed in. Although we have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world, the quality of customer service was truly outstanding. From the moment we arrived to the minute we left the hotel the staff were on hand to deliver our requirements. Each member of staff knew us by name and acknowledged us even going in and out of the hotel. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the personal touch at their hotels",5,2019,02,18
18,Great hotel,"Staff, particularly, are wonderful. For me, they made the stay even better. Lovely hotel in a great position with terrific facilities. Only downside was the awful jazz muzak played in the rooftop lounge bar.",5,2019,02,18
18,What an experience!,"From the time you walk in till the time you walk out, you are transported to a level of service and comfort that's unparalleled. The front desk welcomes you upon arrival with a lovely glass of cava and a decadent piece of chocolate. Perfect after a long journey.",5,2019,02,14
18,Hotel the Serras - Amazing Service & Style,"We just returned from our second stay at the Serras and it was perfect, just as our first stay last summer. Both times, we stayed in a Junior Suite. Our first stay was in a room with a view of the harbor and this time, we had a view overlooking the Barri Gotic. You can't go wrong with either.

The staff at the Serras is both professional and warm and they do everything they can in order to make your stay pleasant and worry-free. There was a taxi strike while we were there this trip and within 30 minutes of the announcement of the strike, there was a note delivered to our room informing us and offering to arrange for cars to the airport to avoid any stress upon departure. We were so appreciative of this extra effort to ensure that our trip home wouldn't be impacted by a last minute rush to secure a ride to the airport.  You're greeted in Reception with a glass of cava and delicious, housemade chocolates before being escorted to your beautifully appointed room. This is the only hotel I've ever stayed with aromatherapy pods to use in the shower and they're super cool! We also received a bottle of cava and a small array of tapas and raspberry macarons to tide us over until our next meal. We recognized some of the staff from a previous visit and enjoyed talking with them about our upcoming summer vacation to the Costa Brava. They were so enthusiastic about sharing their favorite activities and encouraged us to contact the concierge via email for more specific suggestions. It's that extra, kind gesture that makes the Serras staff so special. Also, I have no idea if it's on purpose, but everyone on staff looks like a supermodel, no joke.

If you stay here during the summer, the rooftop bar is the place to enjoy a Gin Mare gin tonic and the beautiful view over the harbor. We actually spent the evening up there in January and it wasn't anywhere near as warm, but they have heat lamps and sofas and as guests of the hotel, we were the only ones there, which was a novelty. 

We've enjoyed breakfast and dinner at Informal, the restaurant in the hotel run by a Michelin-starred chef. Whatever you do, you HAVE to try their version of Patatas Bravas. They're like nothing you've ever eaten and absolutely out of this world.

This is our favorite hotel in Barcelona and are looking forward to another visit on our way home from the Costa Brava in July. They are absolutely deserving of their #1 TripAdvisor ranking.",5,2019,02,13
18,Can't wait to go back,"From the time you walk in through the front door, you are transported to a level of service and comfort that's unparalleled.  the front desk welcomes you upon arrival with a lovely glass of cava and a decadent piece of chocolate... perfect after a long flight... well really, perfect any time.  The rooms are comfortable, the location of the hotel is across from the marina, and still part of Gothic Quarter.  Our first stop is at El Suenos the rooftop deck with it's great views, comfy couches and cocktails.  With each visit our first night meal is with the incredible Chef Danko at Informal restaurant on the first floor of the hotel.  Many thanks to The Hotel Serras for such a wonderful stay.  We will see you again soon
",5,2019,02,12
18,Perfect Stay,"Wonderful hotel with extremely helpful staff in a great location.

Alexandra and the rest of the front desk staff were extremely helpful from pre-check in through checkout.  They helped us book a tour, make restaurant recommendations and gave us a perfect overview of the city.  We also very much appreciated the room upgrade as it was a special occasion weekend.  Thank you!   

The room was new, clean, quiet, and relatively spacious for the city.  We loved the location - easy to walk in and around the Gothic quarter and Born, but loved having the light and space of being by the water.  Rooftop was lovely and relaxing too.  Would definitely recommend to friends!",5,2019,02,11
18,EXCEPTIONAL IN EVERY WAY!,"On the recommendation of our friends, we booked 4 nights at The Serras - a chic and magnificent boutique hotel!    We were greeted with Cava and warm towels and given a tour of the hotel, which included a rooftop, gym, lounge and restaurant.  The hotel is beautifully decorated, with well appointed rooms, nice linens and towels and large bathrooms.  Each room has a ""Handy"", a google device that has maps, internet and calling (all free of charge while staying at the hotel), which we found to be - well, quite handy indeed!  The staff was incredible in helping us book tickets to see all the local attractions, and they also arranged transportation to and from the airport.   The hotel is in THE BEST location, with the Barri Gotic , Born and Waterfront outside the front door!   There is no shortage of restaurants, coffee shops and boutique shopping all around.   There are two metro stations that are also very close and we found that it was easy to navigate the system to get to other areas of the city.    WE LOVED OUR STAY AT THE SERRAS and hope to be able to return to this gem of a hotel AND lovely Barcelona again!    Thank you for making our time is Spain so special!",5,2019,02,07
18,Wonderful experience,"Beautiful boutique hotel with the perfect location. Easy walking distance to many interesting sites. The staff was always available with suggestions/reservations. They not only made the suggestion but followed up with booking reservations and printing map directions if needed.  Our room was comfortable and inviting. Can't say enough about the wonderful staff, especially Jon- friendly, courteous and always welcoming.  We will highly recommend this hotel and look forward to a return visit.",5,2019,02,06
18,Exceptional service and so friendly,"Amazing hotel, the staff were so friendly and made our stay perfect. Our first holiday with our 10weeks old baby and the experience was stress free mostly down to the amazing staff. The hotel provided a cot, baby bath (and baby toiletries) and bouncy chair, more than we ever expected. And hippo is now the new favourite toy!!Thank you so much for making our first family holiday so memorable! ",5,2019,02,05
18,Amazing stay!!,"This has got to be one of the best, if not the best, hotel experience I've ever had.  The customer service and staff friendliness were beyond compare.  I was impressed with everything about the hotel.  The location could not be better, literally walking distance from some of Barcelona's best restaurants.  The amenities of the hotel were great.  This hotel is all about the personal touch.",5,2019,02,05
18,Exceptional Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Las Serras for six nights at the end of January. We selected this small boutique hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and, as usual, we were not disappointed. It truly is an exceptional hotel. The building and rooms are beautiful, the location in the Gothic Quarter can't be beat, the staff is amazing, and the food is among the best we've ever had. All staff members were incredibly accommodating and attentive, but we would especially like to thank Sandra, the breakfast manager, for greeting us with a friendly face and making us feel at home each morning. It didn't hurt that the service and breakfast were superb. If we ever return to Barcelona we will stay at The Serras.",5,2019,02,04
18,Did not meet expectations,"The hotel is cute and located just outside the gothic neighborhood which is perfect for walking and exploring. We unfortunately were there during the taxi strike, which isn’t their fault but we used their car service which was definitely pricey and not always on time. The room was cute, the tub to soak in was nice, unfortunately trash was left when we checked in and had to ask for bath amenities, and the door frame around the bathroom door was coming off ... the final straw was getting to our room after a staff member had just left as we exited the elevator and they had just used our bathroom and left a pungent odor for us to come back to. In the grand scheme these aren’t awful things, the restaurant had a nice dinner service, but for the price we paid including an up charge, it was enough to be disappointed",3,2019,02,03
18,Barcelona,"It’s a very pretty hotel, and the location is excellent.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Dinner at their restaurant Informal was pleasant and relaxing, and the food was delicious. Sunrise from the rooftop was a beautiful sight and refreshing. ",5,2019,02,01
18,Amazing,This was an upscale boutique hotel in a great location and everyone that works there is alway helpful and friendly. The location was perfect for walking to restaurants and shopping.Sandra was so kind and thoughtful to all of my family she made my kids feel at home.,5,2019,01,27
18,Fabulous luxury hotel on the waterfront,We stayed at the Serras for two nights in January 2019. It would be difficult to give this luxury boutique hotel too much praise. Staff members are attentive and helpful without being intrusive. The rooms are comfortable and have everything needed for a relaxing stay. The restaurant is fabulous and offers Catalonian dishes at lunch time and dinner. The breakfast had great variety from the buffet and the choice of a cooked to order course.The recommendations that we received at check-in for both restaurants and things to do (including the cable car) meant that we were able to see more and experience more than we expected in our short visit to Barcelona.,5,2019,01,26
18,Great location. Great sevice,"We had less than a 24 hour layover. The hotel is lovely. Bathroom amazing. Great staff. All good. If you want to be close to the port this hotel checks all the right boxes. Unfortunately, there was a taxi strike and access from the airport was very challenging. We took an Uber back the next day which was easy and stress free. ",5,2019,01,22
18,Absolute luxury in Perfect Location,"The Serras is the ultimate luxury hotel that delivers on every aspect. The customer service from members such as Chris enabled us to go to places we had never dreamt of! 
The location is wonderful, situated on the main promenade and in the gothic quarter, their are tonnes of fabulous restaurants nearby. The rooms are splendid as well as they offer space and luxury which is hard to find in confined cities such as Barcelona. They also give you free phones called 'handy' which enable you to search and to navigate your way around Barcelona without having to use your own very expensive overseas data. The restaurant is also lovely with a large variety of luxury Spanish meals in an ambient setting, my only comment would be that it is a bit pricey. Overall a wonderful stay and would definitely go back!",5,2019,01,17
18,The staff made us feel coming home again,"Second stay in this marvelous hotel. Once again the staff provided us with great hospitality, making us feel we are coming home. The room design and equipment as well as the service are extraordinary. The vicinity to Barri Gòtic and El Born is fantastic to stroll around. Very highly recommended.",5,2019,01,15
18,"Superb, sophisticated and genuinely welcoming","From the moment you make your reservation to the time you leave, the staff at The Serras makes you feel like a valued guest in their gracious, sophisticated hotel. They installed special handgrips in the spacious shower for my 91 year old father, were helpful in finding a good place to eat that was open over the holidays, made bookings for Sagrada Familia and Park Guell, and left little amuse bouches on the nightstand with a fresh solid glass bottle of water every night. Rooms are immaculately clean, the restaurant is top notch (you must try the tapas) and the service warm and friendly without being intrusive. Touches like two sizes of the most comfortable slippers, a personal tour of the premises by reception staff, and a farewell note from the bellman with two bottles of water and a baggie of gummies in our rental car as we departed, were unexpected and truly enchanting.

The location is excellent, within easy walking distance of the waterfront, Barrio Gotik, the Ramblas and such visitor musts as the Cathedral and the Picasso Museum. If you have a rental car, the hotel is easy to reach from the airport, without having to maneuver through Barcelona's many very narrow streets.  Parking is offsite - they valet the car for you.

The Serras is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in my travels around the world's major cities, and that includes members of five star chains like the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton and the Luxury Collection. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,2019,01,14
18,AMAZING Stay at The Serras,"We stayed at The Serras in December 2018 with our two teenage boys.  The hotel was amazing - the rooms very comfortable, the location perfect, and the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was delicious.  Everyone who works there was extremely friendly and made sure that we had everything we needed.  Sandra in the restaurant is the sweetest lady, and she always knew our order before we even sat down!  If we come to Barcelona again we will definitely stay at The Serras!",5,2019,01,13
18,"Great , well located hotel",Excellent rooms and great location make this a great place to stay in Barcelona. The check in process is great right down to the complementary glass of Cava and chocolates. The staff are very helpful . The rooftop bar is good even in winter. ,5,2019,01,11

The rooms although a bit small have very confortable beds with very spacious bathroom. Lastly all staff are extremely kind and helpful!

18,Barcelona,Great hotel. Very intimate and personal. The location was so close to the water and great food. The room was great. The rooftop bar and 1star Miche restaurant were great. The Bartenders on the Rooftop bar were great and made sure I was warm and had a drink in my hand. I would book with them again for sure.,5,2018,12,10
18,Wonderful hotel!,"The Serra's is an incredibly comfortable hotel with attentive staff in a great location.  The rooms were very clean, the food was delicious and everything was wonderful.

18,Probably my favorite hotel in the world,"Everything about our stay was perfect. We’ve stayed in many great hotels, and nothing really has been close to The Serras in terms of genuine warmth of the team here. Sandra in particular was just phenomenal with our whole family, our toddler in particular - I think this photo says it all!  Cannot wait to return here for many years to come. ",5,2018,12,05
18,reviews are correct,"I booked this hotel referring to the many great reviews and my choice was very correct.Their service was very good and room was also very clean and luxury.It's a bit far from train station but still walking distance. In the morning, you can feel fresh air from the sea.Great experience.",5,2018,11,28
18,Divine Boutique Hotel,"A beautiful introduction to Barcelona.  The Serras is gorgeous!  The staff couldn’t have been more helpful particularly when my luggage arrived 24 hours after I did.  They were always on hand to organise transport, restaurant recommendations etc. Nothing was too much trouble. I had a street facing room that was so quiet considering the main road the hotel is on.  So convenient to marina, Gothic Quarter and Bon.  Breakfast was absolutely delicious. Loved the complimentary smart phone with free data and local calls to use as I toured around.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone.  I hope to be back.",5,2018,11,27

18,The best hotel I have experienced,"The Serras is one of the real gems in the world. Everything about this hotel is perfect - the rooms, location, amenities and of course the restaurant 'Informal' is just amazing, but the most important and greatest factor about The Serras are the staff. The Staff are just incredible. I have run out of superlatives to describe this place. Do yourself a favour and book the Serras for an unforgettable experience.",5,2018,11,21
18,The Serras Hotel is Top Notch,"You will be treated like royalty from the minute your car arrives out front. This beautiful boutique hotel is top notch and took amazing care of our family.

We can't wait to go back to Barcelona and stay at this amazing hotel! ",5,2018,11,20
18,Position A in every Way!!,"Hotel is in Position A!!  The front desk, concierge and doorman staff are AMAZING.  In every way.  Huge Thank you.to all of them.  Daniel especially.  And do NOT miss the hotel restaurant for breakfast and dinner.  The Serras is a bit pricier than other top rated places... but WELL WORTH every Euro!!!!  The location enabled us to stroll along the port/marina and Barcelonetta any time we felt like it.  Plus, seemingly in the middle of everything else!  Enjoy!",5,2018,11,19

18,Ah-mazing,The hotel photos do not do the hotel justice - a beautiful boutique hotel with incredible service in a perfect location by the water and shops. We stayed in a grand view room and the bathroom was the size of many European hotel room - it was incredible with two sinks and a large rain shower. The staff are very warm and welcoming and the roof top bar is sensational. The hotel itself is quiet for excellent sleeping conditions and close to the bars and restaurants - a very walk-able location. I cannot image staying anywhere else in Barcelona for future visits - we felt perfectly spoiled!,5,2018,11,16
18,One of the best boutique hotel experiences,"Very good friendly staff, nice rooms, good restaurant and really great location!At intersection of 3 interesting areas - Bari Gotic, El Born and Port. Easy walking everywhere in center. Highly recommend.",5,2018,11,14

18,Perfect stay,"We stayed from Sunday night until Thursday and the trip was perfect. The hotels amenities were spectacular and luxurious but truly the best part is the incredible staff. Sandra who works in the restraunt was incredibly kind and willing to help us with anything we needed. She let us try so many things and took a genuine interest in our stay and the plans we made in Barcelona. Jan and Danny who work in the lobby are truly kind and welcoming people. Whenever I spent time in the lobby they would spend time with us talking, going above and beyond what was required. Alejandro the bar manager know an incredible amount about his craft and made me some of the best drinks I have ever had. The hotel was amazing but the kindness of the staff was truly what made our stay unforgettable.",5,2018,11,08
18,A real Gem,We spent four days at this beautiful hotel.  The service was beyond impeccable and the room beyond comfortable.  It was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on.  And the location was fantastic.  I cannot recommend this hotel strongly enough.  ,5,2018,11,06
18,Perfect location and warm employees,We chose The Serras for its ideal location for exploring the Gothic Quarter and ended up loving it for that - but also for the warm graciousness and friendliness of the employees. It's a small hotel (I think 21 rooms) and the atmosphere is cozy - not something often found in a 5-star. Loved our week there. We ended each evening up on the rooftop terrace. We've been home two days and miss it.,5,2018,11,06
18,best hotel,this was an amazing hotel but comparing to my home city Dubai it's 3 star but still very nice I liked the phone idea wifi available everywhere no need  to open Google maps in my phone because there is the room phone with free Wi-Fi the best idea ever but the pools was very small also the workers there are very respectful  and I  promise you the hotel didn't give my anything to write this I wrote it because I loved it,5,2018,11,03
18,Unbelievable quality of service,"From arrival to departure to all points between, the staff at this hotel is extraordinary. The decor is great, the vibe is fun, the food is fantastic. The rooms are a little small for the price but that's outweighed by the rest of the experience.",5,2018,11,02
18,"The Best Hotel in Barcelona, if not anywhere!","Many reviews already said it all, this is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. I don't have a ton of experience with boutique hotels but this experience convinced me. Everything from the moment we walked in was outstanding. Sergio greeted us with champagne and we were in awe right away.

The best things about this hotel is the staff and the location. 

Sergio, Jan, and Laura, among others were just amazing. Thank you guys so much for making our experience one to never forget. Laura, you are amazing. My wife and I loved you and wanted to be friends. We hope to meet again in the future! 

The location is right in the born, one of the best neighborhoods of Barcelona. There's great nightlife that made this an amazing experience. Some places that we went to (recommended to us by Jan and Laura) were Dr. Stravinski, Numero Nueve, Mr. Robinson, Bar Sauvage, and the best of all - Paradiso. Definitely check out this bar for amazing cocktails and world class bartenders. There will be a line but the front of the shop doubles as a pastrami shop until you can walk through the ""secret"" fridge door. Very cool! 

Very centralized location. Very clean and great amenities. If you're a foodie, make yourself a reservation at their restaurant Informal. Small and intimate. Small portions but incredible food, impeccable service. Once again, Laura was the best! 

Thank you again and we hope to be back in the future!",5,2018,11,02
18,Terrific Barcelona Hotel,"My wife and I prefer boutique hotels to the large, business and event hotels.  We like the intimacy and superior, individualized service offered and, the absence of crowded lobbies and front desks.  The Serras offers all this along with an outstanding location and a superior facility.

The location is on a main avenue directly across the street from the yacht basin.  It is an easy, five minute or so walk to the Baceloneta beach area, to Las Ramblas and is directly on the southern side of the Gothic area.   The location provides convenient access to the city without being in the middle of the crowds of tourist, particularly along the Las Ramblas area.

The other key location preference for us, now that we are older, is safety.  The location is on a main avenue.  We were not out past midnight but at least until that time, we felt completely safe with just the two of us walking back on Passeig de Colom.

Service at the Serras is outstanding.  It was as good as, and perhaps the best I have encountered in my many years of travel.  We booked our airport transfers through the hotel.  It is more expensive than that available on the internet but was excellent and much appreciated after an overnight flight.  When we arrived at the Serras, we were immediately met at our transfer car and assisted with luggage.  On entering, instead of the typical check-in counter, there were two small desks.  We were offered coffee, tea, etc., while checking in.  The check-in process was simple and friendly.  We were shown maps and suggestions on things to see and places to go.  They offered to get tickets for us for a few of the venues we were interested in that normally sell out or have long ticket lines.  After check-in, we were shown the basic service areas of the hotel (restaurant, rooftop bar, library bar) and then taken to our room by our hostess.  This kind of personalized service occurred during our entire stay.

We stayed in a junior suit for our first stay at the beginning of our vacation and a superior room on our next overnight stay before flying home.  Both rooms were, like the rest of the hotel facilities, modern, well maintained and spotlessly clean.  Both were extremely quiet.  Amenities were upper scale.  They had a first for me.  Their rooms have a cellphone which guests may use while visiting.  We didn’t use it but I assume that in addition to making local calls you can also use the phone’s GPS application to find your way around the city.

Our first room was a corner room and offered views from one window of a building across an alleyway and from the other windows a view of a building across a wider alleyway.  The views were fine for being in a city but based on their website description, I was expecting a little more of a view.  Their rooftop bar more than offset any disappointment in the room view.  It is outstanding, with a wonderful view of the yacht basin.

We only tried their restaurant for breakfast, which was good.  
I have traveled extensively over my career and since retirement.  Based on our lodging preferences, I put The Serras in the top three boutique hotels I have stayed in.",5,2018,10,31
18,Can't wait to stay again,"From check in to check out, I was blown away by the complete experience of The Serras. From the moment we walked in we were made to feel extremely welcome and have our needs catered to, from the friendly receptionist to the wet towel and delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. 

Of course, the decor and attention to detail in the room and common areas of the hotel are also wonderful touches. But so was the tour of the property, and the detailed explanation of the things our room offered. I've never experienced a room tour before, but often find it's much needed when I can't figure out how to work an appliance or get the right light switch to work. So that was a lovely bonus. 

Plus, the room was impeccably clean - my main concern any where I stay, wonderfully decorated (plus a balcony with double-pane glass doors) and had great amenities and super comfortable bedding. The smart phone and free long distance calling that they offer in your room for you to use while perusing the city was the icing on the cake. 

The hotel is walking distance to great restaurants on the waterfront, the Gothic Quarter, and fantastic reliable public transport (the bus out front connects you to the plaza where the airport buses go). And even at 6 am, the staff was just as friendly as we checked out and they helped point us in the right direction of the bus.",5,2018,10,29
18,Great boutique hotel,"We spent three nights at this wonderful hotel. The room was beautiful though small, the service was impeccable and friendly and the food for both breakfast and dinner was terrific. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and gave us great recommendations.",5,2018,10,29
18,Great spot!!,"The hotel lives up to the high reviews.  I would state that the differentiator is the staff compared to other high end hotels we have enjoyed.

They are genuinely friendly and take an interest in you and take pride in their city and are full of recommendations.  We thought Danny (Daniel) who worked in the front was GREAT.  What a nice young man.  Any hotel wanting to study exemplary customer service should study this property.",5,2018,10,28
18,Excellent,I am a frequent traveller and this is the one of the best service hotels I have ever stayed at. The staff is incredibly responsive and goes out of their way to help.....well done. It’s also well located and very quiet. ,5,2018,10,27
18,Excellent.,"I often travel in 5* hotels during my business trip and I rarely found such a perfect combination of staff friendliness and availability, room style and cleanliness, food quality. Will certainly come back.",5,2018,10,27
18,I will never stay anywhere else in Barcelona,"Extraordinary service from the moment I made my reservation!  They inquired when we would be arriving and when we arrived, weary after 16 hours of traveling, we were greeted by friendly, calm, kind people. They offered us cava and water and brought us chocolates. 

When we got to our room, we had culinary treats waiting for us and a bed fit for a queen. Literally. Apparently the beds are the same as the beds in Buckingham Palace!

A+ on service, A+ on the comfort. The room provides a cell phone to take into the city that you can use for maps and calls. Both local and international. There is even an umbrella. They have thought of everything a visitor needs.

Ok now....the rooftop bar....beautiful views of the port and perfect cocktails. We had amazing mojitos and lounged in the sun. And I don’t know what is on the popcorn they serve with drinks, but it’s delicious. 

So then we went for a walk. You can walk to the beaches from the hotel, but we went “behind” the hotel and explored the charming, romantic narrow streets and shops and piazzas (probably not the right word) and cathedrals. 

We went back to the hotel and rested a bit before dinner at Informal the hotel restaurant. We NEVER eat in the restaurant of a hotel, but even if you don’t stay here, you should eat here!  We had the most spectacular gnocchi with shaved white truffles (‘tis the season) and then I had veal tartare and my husband had a filet of amberjack  that was cooked perfectly.  My tartare was absolutely perfect. We had a 2015 chateauneuf de pape with our meal and ended up making friends with the people sitting next to us. Back to the rooftop bar for more wine!

Less than 18 hours after we arrived we had the breakfast buffet and I hate to keep saying delicious and perfect but these are the right words. The meats, the cheeses, the pastries, the eggs, the juices....they were all fresh and scrumptious!

We left to go to Valencia for a few days and had plans to stay elsewhere when we returned to Barcelona but were fortunate that The Serras had a room available. We will return and do everything all over again!

Magical, personal service. Clean, comfortable rooms.  World-class food.

Stay here.  You will love it.

18,One of best hotels I have ever stayed in,"Great friendly and professional service, fabulous restaurant, nice rooftop bar/lounge. One of best dinners I have ever had. Staff went out of the way to be helpful. Perfect location. I would definitely recommend to anyone who can afford this level of hotel.",5,2018,10,26
18,"Amazing Hotel, Amazing Staff, great location","We stayed here on 2 different times in October as we went to Majorca for 3 days then came back for an overnight stay for our flight home next day. From check in when we were met at curb to handle our excessive luggage, to check in desk where we received chilled Cava and a nice wash cloth to wipe away the travel. All staff were great from beginning to end, shout out to Sergio who was super helpful. Our room was nice and clean, even came with a cell phone for us to use during our stay. Great big rainfall shower, dual vanity sinks, lots of room. Bed was super comfy, room was quiet as well. Rooftop pool and bar area are small but a really nice area to enjoy the sun, Marina views. Everyone remembered our name when we came back 3 days later. When we come back to Barcelona this is the only place we will stay...",5,2018,10,24
18,Hidden gem,"I cannot tell you how amazing this hotel is. With their warm welcome and how obviously they want our business (refreshing for a 4/5 star hotel) so I have to share this wonderful hotel with you. 
Prior to our cruise we stayed at the W (great view but bad location) and I truly wish we had stayed here instead.
The staff is perfect, the location is perfect, and the rooms are perfect. Come see this lovely little hotel for yourself.  We will be returning for a longer stay as soon as we can! ",5,2018,10,23
18,Sheer brilliant and outstanding hotel,Awesome hotel. Great location. Rooms super comfy with amazing beds and pillows. Service from all the staff was A+++. Roof top bar is the perfect place to relax after a day out in the town. Best place to stay in Barcelona. ,5,2018,10,22
18,The most lovely hotel stay,"From the moment we checked in at The Serras, we had the most amazing experience. The staff welcomed you with warm smiles as they open the door for you and offer you a seat as they check you in. One staff member greeted us with our choice of coffee or champagne, and another brought delightful chocolate over. They then spent 10 minutes reviewing the city and some of their favorite spots. After answering all of our questions, they personally took us to our room, hauled our luggage, and showed us the ammenities in the room. The hotel was beautiful, the room absolutely adorable, and the location is in the heart of everything (while not being extremely touristy). Our favorite area next to the hotel was El Born and we spent most of our time here and it was only a 5 minute walk. Thank you to everyone here - what a treat it was to stay with you!",5,2018,10,22
18,Amazing,I Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again the next time I’m in Barcelona. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The hotel called me before my arrival to assist with any additional booking. Only wish I was able to stay longer. Better then expect. ,5,2018,10,20
18,5 Stars is not enough for this property,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at The Serras for 3 nights while visiting our son who was studying in Barcelona. The staff was super friendly and nothing was too much trouble during our stay. We also really liked the location of the hotel. They booked tickets for us, made restaurant reservations (all of their recommendations were great-specifically Ceccioni [Italian} down the street) The last night we ate in the hotel restaurant which was absolutely incredible. The room was clean, very updated and we had a small balcony. The shower even has pods of aromatherapy that you stick into the hand sprayer! The bed was very comfortable and every night they bring you fresh cold bottles of water and a little dessert. One night we decided to go have a drink at the W hotel which is right on the water. The view is great but the staff there was so unfriendly we were happy with our decision to stay at The Serras. We've stayed at many hotels over the years, and this ranks in the top 5. I hope we can return someday.",5,2018,10,19
18,Five Stars for Great Value,"We LOVED our stay at Hotel Serras. 

The location is brilliant- across from the harbor promenade, where huge yachts rest at anchor, a short stroll from Las Rambles, and in a neighborhood with an abundance of cute cafes and restaurants.

The staff were friendly and attentive and during our comings and goings greeted us each time as though they were delighted to see us. They were always available to arrange taxis or to provide tips and advice. 

The room was small but elegant and though at first we were disappointed that our balcony appeared to not have a view, we discovered that it looked onto a quaint neighborhood alley with large beautiful buildings at each end. The bed was a true king bed “just like they have at Buckingham Palace” with a wonderful selection of pillows. The bathroom had both a rain shower and handheld with great water pressure and temp control.

The rooftop bar was pleasant and the restaurant, Informal, was wonderful serving breakfast from 7:30a. Every meal there was terrific.

We definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again on our return trips to Barcelona.",5,2018,10,19
18,Perfection,"I absolutely loved this hotel.   It is a small boutique hotel with the perfect location.   The roof top deck is a perfect place to hang out at night for a night cap and relax after a long day - it over looks the harbor.  The back of the hotel is right on the gothic center.     The rooms - and we did a smaller room were super nice.   Large bathroom, wonderful beds and linen.   A handy phone to make long distant calls internet access, etc at n/c.  I could go on and on.   Staff is remarkable. Wonderful restaurant.  Definitely a 5 star hotel.   I would recommend it highly.     ",5,2018,10,17
18,Excellent Stay at the Serras,"We originally selected the hotel for its rooftop deck and location over the water.Ii did not want to be located too close to Las Ramblas due to pickpockets and tourist noise, nor too far away from the action of town.  This hotel is located perfectly within walking distance of those areas, close to the metro to get around town and especially to go into the El Born area of Barcelona. We loved the location because we could walk to restaurants along the water to drink Galician white wines and eat fried boquerones and paella as well as enjoy the El Born shopping.  The hotel has a beautiful rooftop deck that is a fantastic amenity and lovely to sit and drink at after a long day of exploring. Another important point about the hotel is its Excellent Air Conditioning!!! The rooms are well appointed and the shower had excellent water pressure.   The bed was Very comfortable as well. The most interesting thing about this hotel is its staff. I don't think I've ever stayed in a place where it is so apparent that the staff likes their jobs and will go above and beyond for you every single time you see them.  They were especially helpful in arranging Barcelona Football tickets and getting us to the right shops to purchase wines to send home. There is a unique atmosphere in this hotel due to the staff's character, professionalism and generosity of spirit.  You can't go wrong with this simply wonderful hotel!",5,2018,10,16
18,Great Hotel & Fantastic Staff,We have just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona & can't rate The Serras Hotel highly enough! The Serras has a great location near both the marina & Gothic Quarter of town so all within easy walking distance. The hotel amenities are great & staff were fantastic - no hesitations recommending this hotel.  Faultless!,5,2018,10,16
18,Excellent stay! ,"I stayed here with my mother for 3 nights and we loved this hotel. The room was so comfortable, usable and innovative. There was a separate area for bags and luggage, the beds were set up as I requested which was greatly appreciated and they were SO comfortable. They said the sheets were the same as in Buckingham palace....it didn’t really matter, they were some of the softest sheets I’ve slept on and I’m a soft sheet person! Anyhow, the location of the hotel is quite central and even in a busy area, the room was really quiet. The bathroom was a little sanctuary in itself. There was a very cool jacuzzi bathtub and a spa shower with an essential oil dispenser. The rooftop bar was a comfortable place to just have a drink and relax in the evenings. This will be my go to place in Barcelona now. It’s exactly what I expect with a 5* hotel. ",5,2018,10,14
18,a wonderful Boutique hotel with service and comfort at its best,"I frequently stay in hotels and cannot fault The Serras, from the minute you check in to be greeted with a glass of Cava, the service is excellent, friendly yet not overpowering. The room is so comfortable with a great bathroom and all the amenities you want. Roof top pool bar is a great place day or night - although more a plunge pool, no really for swimming! Location is ideal to walk everywhere and the nearby recommended  restaurants perfect. Definitely going back (once we have saved up) - it was 5 days in heavenly bliss.",5,2018,10,11
18,VERY GOOD BOUTIQUE HOTEL IN BARCELONA,"We liked very much this boutique hotel.The personel was very friendly ,the room was very nice ,the hotel location was excelent. We liked a lot the bar at the rooftop of the hotel with very nice view and very ggod coctails, we visited every night when come back tired at the hotel.We recomend this hotel and we will stay again the next time we will visit Barcelona. ",5,2018,10,09
18,Excellent !,"The kindness and attentiveness of all employees.Russian-speaking Nina and Daniel.Among the short comings - the lack of a desk, the unfortunate location of the TV.Считаю преувеличением указывать в описании возможностей отеля наличие бассейна на крыше.",5,2018,10,09
18,Exceptional staff,"We were staggered by the staff in this hotel. They really are amazing,other hotels should take note. I am lucky enough to stay in many hotels of a high standard but the people here really make it a truly fantastic experience. The staff here are ahead of you in what you might want or need. We were given a bottle of Cava in our room on arrival as it was out wedding anniversary. When we came to drink it the next afternoon it was room temperature (of course), so I rang for an ice bucket. They appeared with a chilled bottle and an ice bucket. They then suggested drinking it on the roof top terrace, which is a lovely spot to sit and relax. Their restaurant suggestions were spot on for what we had asked for. The hotel is fitted out to a high standard, the beds are super comfy and the shower was divine. This place will only get more expensive, go now.",5,2018,10,08
18,Fantastic Hotel with Great Staff,"I had organised an engagement at the hotel with the staff who were very accommodating and more than helpful. The staff were also amazing on the day and could not do enough for us. Brunch served was also of the highest quality
The rooftop bar is great with fantastic views over the port

We will be back to stay in the hotel for our anniversary!",5,2018,10,08
18,Outstanding hotel with amazing people!,"I do not normally do reviews but I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The bedroom and facilities were great but what makes this hotel outstanding is its people. Every member of staff we met were helpful, pro-active and cheerful - they truly wanted to do their best for their guest. Great rooftop bar with amazing views over the port topped it off.  ",5,2018,10,05
18,Perfect hotel in Barcelona! ,"What can be said of this property that hasnt already been stated? The location is so unbelievably perfect. Right on the edge of the Gothic quarter overlooking the harbor. If you are driving it couldnt be eaiser getting in and out of the city. But as good as the location is it is incomparable to the staff. Without a doubt one of the main reasons to stay at this amazing hotel is its staff. Everyone knows your name from the time you check in to the time you depart. They go out of their way to make your stay remarkable. For example the first person we met was the front door man Daniel. He was so perfect at his job that he made each interaction so memorable which inevitability enhanced our entire stay. We were so fortunate to have met him. He gave us countless suggestions and greeted us warmly every time. It was like coming home to family. He simply made our vacation better. 
Our accomodation was a Grand Deluxe room overlooking a quiet street which was very cozy with a large bathroom. The bed was super comfortable. 
We loved the rooftop terrace. It was actually too nice. Sometimes you didnt want to leave and go exploring because you just felt like relaxing by the small pool. It was a great place to grab a glass of wine and watch sunset before heading out for dinner. 
Overall we were so elated with our choice of staying at this amazing property. We left Barcelona, which is so amazing on its own merits, feeling like our choice of accomodation actually made our experience exponentially better. We cannot thank the staff enough for their incredibly gracious hospitality. We wouldnt consider another property next time in Barcelona. ",5,2018,10,03
18,Auperb,"Exceptional hotel! Extremely high quality rooms and facilities. All the staff, in particular main reception, are friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and welcoming. We will definitely be staying there again! Unreservedly recommend! ",5,2018,10,02

18,Perfect location,"Lovely hotel overlooking the harbour close to the gothic quarter which made the location perfect.  Hotel staff were warm and friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had a comfortable stay.  We had a junior suite which wasn’t the biggest we’ve stayed in being not much larger than a standard room and the balcony was too small to sit on, that said, the beds were extremely comfortable and the air conditioning perfect.  The roof terrace made a perfect spot to start and finish the evening.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2018,10,02
18,"Exceptional, highly recommend ","We are currently sipping wine on the roof terrace on our last day and will be very sad to leave.  Wow this hotel is first class! it is the wonderful friendly staff that makes this hotel feel so homely, a huge thank you to everyone for making it a very special weekend 

Like other reviewers we have stayed at many 5 star hotels but have never received such a warm welcome and that includes the four seasons.

Only constructive  comments would be suggest leaving more tea, coffee and milk in room... most days we only had 1 sachet of milk!! however I am sure if we had phoned more would have delivered 

Great location within Barcelona ! we will miss you thank you

18,The best service - ever. Truly spectacular.,"The entire team at The Serras was absolutely spectacular. We’ve stayed at many of the finest hotels in the world, and we’ve never experienced such genuine personal service as we did at The Serras. We only stayed two nights, but they were fantastic. From the moment we walked through the doors, to the amazing dinner we had at Informál, and finally to our departure, every member of the staff was beyond extraordinary.

18,Perfect in Barcelona!,"I am a hotel snob -- always seeking ""experience"" hotels that make our travels special -- and The Serras exceeded my every expectation!  The staff and their customer service is the best we have ever experienced.  They are always attentive to every need (if only the rest of the world functioned this way!) The hotel is small, elegant and incredibly comfortable. We loved the design style -- clean lines and more muted in color choices, which creates a very relaxing environment. The guest rooms are stylish and well appointed and the beds (which we are told are the same as those found in Buckingham Palace) are incredible. The room was also very quiet, which we appreciated after long days of sight seeing.  A sweet treat was bedside every evening! They even provide a smart phone you can use while staying at the hotel and include international calling!  We loved the location -- so close to the gothic quarter. Las Ramblas and the port.  It is the only hotel we have ever stayed at that contacted us multiple times before our stay to make sure all was in order, and arranged our ride from the airport.  There is nothing not to love about this hotel -- if we make it back to Barcelona, we will definitely return to the The Serras.",5,2018,09,17
18,Perfect plus!,"This hotel is beyond amazing! The hotel, rooms, decor, restaraunt, rooftop are all perfect! The staff sets it apart in our opinion. Even before we left the states we received a phone call confirming our arrival and plans. From the beginning we experienced exceptional service. Our driver from the airport was friendly and knowledgeable. Upon arrival the same level of service continued. Easy check in, with a tour and cava to enjoy! Daniel was outstanding and we looked forward to his smile and greeting every time we saw him. The rooftop was a nightly stop and Dora and Andrea were delightful and we felt as though we had made “friends” by the time we left. The food was amazing, the restaurant is outstanding. So many little touches throughout our stay.....There is so much more to say, but you seriously just need to experience it for yourself! We loved it and plan to return.

18,Will definitely come back!,"Absolutely loved this place! Fantastic hotel and staff and the little touches from the glass of cava upon arrival to the present left for my son helped make the start of what was an amazing stay. This may be a boutique hotel aimed more at adults / couples but they welcomed my little boy with open arms and were wonderful with him. Sandra the breakfast manager was fantastic and so attentive and my son also loved spending time with Rodriguez and Daniel who made so much effort with him. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them, from talking to my son to booking restaurants and getting taxis. We ate in both the roof top terrace and the restaurant and the food in both places was fantastic. The hotel is also in a perfect position for exploring Barcelona. Would recommend this place every time and will definitely be coming back next time we’re in Barcelona.",5,2018,09,13

18,First Time in Barcelona,"We have traveled all over the world and I can truly say that Hotel The Serras was one of the finest we have ever stayed at. A small, cozy, clean, well decorated and a perfect location across from the marina. All the staff displayed the highest level of customer service and professionalism and there was nothing too small to ask for that they wouldn't accommodate us. In fact we got lost looking for a Tapas Bar and one of the staff actually walked us there a few blocks from the hotel. We will be back at The Serras.",5,2018,09,10
18,Highly recommend! 5 star experience!,"We really enjoyed our stay. Excellent location, service and amenities. The attention to detail was impressive. The rooftop bar is really nice, delicious food and drinks! We will definitely return, thank you to all the staff! ",5,2018,09,10
18,Beautiful hotel in the gothic quarter,"Was here for only two nights for a wedding but enjoyed this hotel much more vs the Mandarin Oriental where we were 2 years ago.  The hotel was gorgeous, the staff /service were excellent, the amenities excellent (Diptyque toiletries, free bottle of cava in the room, Ruinart champagne & Macallan in the mini bar). Our med sea front interconnecting rooms (junior suite seaview & grand deluxe room) were quiet and immaculate.  We unfortunately didn’t get to try Informal (went to Disfrutar & Tickets instead).   It wasn’t cheap and I wished we had bathtubs but I loved it here.  ",5,2018,09,10
18,Boutique Experience,+ Great location near the marina & gothic quarter.+ Great design & decor.+ Daily water bottles & condiments.+ Staff were really friendly.- Inconsistent Housekeeping- Expensive breakfast- Small Gym & Pool,4,2018,09,09
18,Fantastic hotel,"This was a great 5 star hotel very close to the beach.   There is a variety store located just two doors down from it. It has a very small pool which is only suitable for sitting in but not to swim. The rooms are small but comfortable for two people. With 3, it felt a little cramped. The hotel is in great condition and is highly recommended ",5,2018,09,07
18,5 star service and quality. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"Hotel Serras was the best hotel we have ever stayed at.    The genuine personal service felt like you were staying in a family home. Nothing was too much trouble. 
Upon arrival we were greeted by Bae who was very lovely and helpful with her knowledge of what attractions to see. Not only did she personally provide outstanding recommendations but she then booked all of our tickets, provided us with VIP passes and then personally wrote up our itinerary with a detailed map for each days journey.   Extraordinary!
(Champagne on arrival really kick started the amazing vibe).
Dańel was also amazing with his knowledge of local taps restaurants and he really went out his way to make sure we were having an amazing time. The General Manager personally welcomed us which was brilliant. Another mention was Heli who remembered my partners name and order every morning. Wow!!! 
11/10 to Hotel Serras - Sharon / Matthew from Australia. 🇦🇺 ",5,2018,09,05
18,"Amazing Hotel, if staying in Barcelona do not hesitate to book!","This not only a beautiful hotel but the staff is amazing and take customer services excellence to the next level. We were continuously amazed with their attention to detail and ability to anticipate guest needs. The hotel is located were Picasso had his first studio, which is located at the roof (now a beautiful pool and  with views to the sea and Colombus monument). The people we met Rodrigo, Daniel, Andrea, Robinson and Antonio were very attentive and their recommendations helped us navigate the city easier. The hotel is easily accessible by subway and is also near las Ramblas, it is located at the gothic area of the city, the location is second to none. 
The room is very comfortable and has Hypnos mattress which is very comfortable(apparently Buckingham palace has them too). The air conditioning was very good and easy to use. They provide a cellphone that you can use for making and receiving calls while staying in Barcelona. They have a Michelin Star restaurant that is excellent. You will thank me if this review helps you decide on booking this hotel. 
The hotel staff takes the word generosity to the next level.
I wish to return someday to this same hotel.",5,2018,09,05
18,Superb in every way ,"I am writing the review while waiting to leave this amazing hotel on our way back to Madrid. I love to travel and look for nice places to stay... and this hotel is a gem in Barcelona! Located in the gothic quarter steps away from the harbor and close to every attraction. From the moment we checked in, everyone made us feel special even already knowing who we were and the welcome reception had everything from the cold towel to the welcome drink with chocolates! Rodrigo and Daniel are very knowledgeable and lovely gentlemen that help us navigate this vibrant city. The room was perfect in size with every amenity you need and the AC works like a charm! We experience a small hiccup prior to check out with a stubborn security box that refused to open... the issue was managed promptly with the professionalism and charm that you could expect from a 5 star hotel! Thanks Robinson! Antonio the manager was even by our side and made everything go smoothly! I can’t express my gratitude with the spectacular service! Don’t look any further... if you want to feel like a star stay here. Hotel The Serras is without a doubt the best boutique hotel in Barcelona! Hope we can come back visit them again! Tip: don’t miss eating at their Michelin star restaurant... delicious doesn’t do it justice!",5,2018,09,05
18,Exceptional hotel all around,"My husband and I stayed at the Serras for 4 days this past week and we loved every second of it. A few days before we even checked in, we got a call from the hotel asking us for our check in time and if we needed any special accommodations. As soon as we got there, the staff came outside to help us with the luggage and we were greeted with champagne and chocolate. From there and on, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome at the hotel; from helping us navigate the city to giving us food recommendations and making us dinner reservations.
The hotel’s location is wonderful; walking distance to sooo many amazing restaurants/bars, the Gothic quarter, and the beach. The hotel’s rooftop is beautiful and cozy with a small pool and amazing views of the city (I had the BEST ceviche at the rooftop restaurant. Their chef is a Michelin Star chef btw). The rooms are clean and modern and we loved the turn down service every night which they left us water and a small sweet treat. 
Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a true 5-star experience. Thank you Serras team and we can’t wait to be back soon!",5,2018,09,02
18,Hotel The Serras,"Amazing hotel, had a great time staying at beautiful property Hotel The Serras. It was little expensive for my pocket but it was worth. This is ranked no 1 hotel in Barcelona and it is for the reason. ",5,2018,08,31
18,A short break,Everything about the hotel was excellent. We are experienced travellers and have rarely stayed in a hotel that performed so comprehensively well in all aspects. A particular feature was the courtesy and helpfulness of the staff.,5,2018,08,31
18,Miroslav,We were first time in the hotel The Serras and we were very satisfied with our stay there. Our opinion is that The Serras is great and absolutely worth visiting hotel. We hope that we will visit The Serras again.,5,2018,08,30
18,First Visit to Barcelona,"This place is amazing...Perfect location across from the marina yet on the edge of the Gothic area.  Beautiful design, extremely clean, killer rooftop, and highly professional and friendly staff.  And excellent restaurant in the hotel.  In a word: Perfect!",5,2018,08,30
18,"A boutique hotel with real class & style,married with outstanding service & real hospitality.","Nothing was to much trouble, everyone went out of their way to anticipate our needs, whilst creating a atmosphere of relaxation & informality. Great attention to detail, from the staffs smart but casual uniforms ,to the silent efficient, easily controlled air conditioning.Hard to decide what we enjoyed most, all the little extras,such as the soothing icecream canapé by the pool or the complimentary glass of Cava on arrival,it all combined to make our stay memorable.Thank you",5,2018,08,29
18,Heavenly spot,"Thank you The Serras for your nice welcome and hospitality. The overall quality both soft and hard are impeccable and exceeded my initial expectation. It was a shame that we only had 2 nights and could not enjoy the hotel to full extent including the restaurant, but from the delicious taste of croissant I had for quick breakfast, I can imagine the F&B standard is surely guaranteed.  We shall definitely come back for more discoveries on our next journey to the city.",5,2018,08,29
18,Bewertung,"Very, very good. The service was more than amazing and I would defintely recommend the hotel. We really enjoyed our stay, especially because of the warm hearted and more than friendly staffs. It's such a familiar and trustful hotel. Thank you!",5,2018,08,28
18,Best spot to stay !,"Not only the location in walking distance from the old centre and the coastline, but especially the great , friendly and outstanding service from the hotel staff is remarkable.
Definitely our spot in Barcelona!",5,2018,08,28
18,World class,"I’ve been fortunate to stay in many luxury properties in North America, Europe and South East Asia.

The Serras ranks as absolutely one of the very best of those world wide in my experience. Why? I would first and foremost have to say the people, and corresponding service. Rodriguez , only recently living in Barcelona for two years from Venezuela, greeted us. He immediately made my family feel welcome, as if we were coming into their home. Even before we arrived, The Serras phoned me in Vancouver, my home,three days in advance of our arrival to tell me how they were looking forward to our stay, and was there anything we needed? Unique and exceptional in my travels to have a hotel contact you in advance of your stay.

The staff in both the ‘Front Room’( I hesitate to call it a front desk, more like a well appointed living room in ones home) were exceptional, as were those in Informal, the Marc Gascon dining room, including the delightful young woman interning and off next to London, as well as everyone who works on the delightful rooftop terrace bar/pool.

Food was top notch, rooms well appointed, amenities and little touches such as excellent sweet amuse bouche at turndown are well executed and received.

I don’t often feel compelled to write reviews. The Serras is a rare exception, a true gem.

Thank you. We will definitely be back.

18,5 Star Hotel!,"We booked The Serras based on others reviews. Wow were they right! This hotel is amazing! I can’t say enough about the service. From the minute you walk through the door you are pampered. We arrived late at night (15 hours delayed) and were greeted with a glass of champagne. That set the tone for the rest of our stay. The front desk staff is exceptional. They handled all our tours and helped us with dinner reservations. Jan went above and beyond in helping us rent a car. Breakfast in the restaurant was a wonderful way to start the day because of Sandra and Eva. They greeted us with a smile every morning and remembered what we liked to drink. The hotel has a great rooftop pool and bar. The staff makes sure you have everything you need, bringing you ice water and cool towels on hot days. On our last day we celebrated by the pool with a bottle of champagne. Lena made sure to keep it chilled and even poured it for us when we were in the pool!I can’t say enough about The Serras. You must go and experience it!",5,2018,08,25
18,Great Location Great Hotel,Believe all the reviews you read.  This is a great boutique hotel in a very good location.  The hotel staff is outstanding and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable.  The rooms are cleverly designed and spacious with a more contemporary decor.,5,2018,08,22
18,No wonder they have a large majority of 5*,"One night stay in this hotel and from the beginning we knew it deserves its 5 stars. They make you confortable in an instant and will do their best to accommodate you. The room aren’t large but aren’t small either, the pool is small but it’s common in Barcelona where pool are mostly rooftops in small buildings. Breakfast is really good, the snack at the rooftop is nice, greatly decorated and waiters are welcoming. The Michelin starred restaurant is amazing and really not expensive for what you eat. A special thank you to the French team at the restaurant, they really helped us chose something for our son (6 yo). 
This will be our hotel for our next trips in Barcelona ",5,2018,08,21
18,super hotel,"I really like this hotel no more words to say 
I spent a Wonderfull stay other there 
everything was great staff food rooms especially the kindness of the staff thanks a lot for you host and for sure I will be back",5,2018,08,16
18,Best Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"My SO and I had an amazing experience staying here! The staff was incredibly caring, nice, and helpful from check-in to check-out. The room was very cozy, the bed was magical, and they even provided a cell phone you could use during your stay which proved to be especially useful. Lastly the location was prime, close to tons of restaurants, the beach just a walk away as well as the more popular tourist attractions. I highly recommend staying here you won’t regret it! ",5,2018,08,15
18,"Beautiful boutique hotel, stylish room","We enjoyed the welcoming staff and the food for breakfast, dinner at the ground floor restaurant. Lunch is available on the rooftop terrace and was equally excellent. We will for sure return during our next stay ",5,2018,08,14
18,Probably the best hotel in Barcelona,"Perfect location, very attentive, friendly and helpful staff, from the time of arrival to the time of departure. The room was clean and spacious, very comfortable bed and soundproofed room. Despite the central busy location it was very quiet in the room. Probably the best hotel in Barcelona.",5,2018,08,14
18,Comments of our stay,We went to the Serras Hotel in Barcelone.  Everything was perfect.  We loved that hotel.The staff were very nice.  We arrived by cruise et it was the taxi's strick.  They sent someone to pick we up at the pier.  Wery good service,5,2018,08,13
18,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Great Location","Having stayed at some amazing hotels, this is right up there with the best. Small hotel with great places to hang out, in a perfect location. The staff made amazing recommendations for meals, private tours, and had every detail arranged along the way- from the time we got there until all of our suitcases were loaded in the car for the airport. Great spots to have a cocktail after dinner at the roof top bar. It was too hot there to use the pool for us- it is small but has a soho club feel. One thing I really loved is that it had so many English speaking Satellite TV Stations. I had a little jet lag and it was so nice, (and rare in Europe), to have options in the middle of the night to watch. We had two rooms and came with our teenage kids. They did not want to go to dinner with us every night so they could grab meals very close to the hotel. It was a safe neighborhood. Also recommend the Fat tire Guadi bike tour, which is located walking distance to Hotel Serras and the kids loved it. Hotel arranged a private tour to Monserrat which was also wonderful and super interesting/educational. We loved Barcelona! Thanks Serras! Book here- you will not be sorry!",5,2018,08,12
18,Honeymoon Stay,"I'll start by saying, this hotel is out of our price range and we splurged as it was the final night of our honeymoon. Hotel The Serras provided us with an experience we will never forget. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty by all the staff. Our room was excellent. One of the most comfortable beds with the softest pillows. The bathroom had a Jacuzzi tub and huge shower. We ate at El Informal, which like the hotel, treated us like royalty and provided us one of the best meals during our stay in Barcelona. After exploring the city, we ended up on the rooftop at El Sueno, where we had some very tasty drinks and tapas. In my opinion, the money we spent was well worth it, and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",5,2018,08,08
18,Great Hotel in Barcelona,"Great staff, first class experience.  We arrived and had a very warm welcome. our room was ready early.  We enjoyed the rooftop pool immensely. the rooms were large, clean, great bathrooms, and we had some welcome champagne!",5,2018,08,06
18,Fantastic Hotel in Perfect Location,"I’d give this hotel 10 stars if I could. The service, the location, the amenities were all amazing. The staff went above and beyond at every turn, including to make our toddler happy. They fit us in at their Michelin rated restaurant twice during our stay. On top of everything else they were honest - I left my purse in the lounge and it was returned by housekeeping with everything inside. I can’t name everyone but Sergio, Rosalba, Andres, and Daniel were just a few of the stand outs that made our trip so special. We can’t wait to go back!",5,2018,08,05
18,Another 5 star review,"What more can I add? The staff at this hotel made our trip so memorable. We stayed 7 nights at The Serras and they became like family. The room was beautiful, the bed so comfortable, the location right in the middle of Bari Gotic.",5,2018,08,04
18,Fab hotel,"It’s the first time we were stayed in a boutique hotel as we normally stayed in big 5 star hotels. It didn’t disappoint us as the staff got to know you personally . 
Hotel is in great location , we stayed here before the cruise and after the cruise.( on my last night here) 

Check in was speedy.
The rooftop is lovely . 
We ate twice in the informal for dinner. It was lovely and catered well for gluten free.
Breakfast is good , however I am a coeliac I would like to see gluten free cereal and yoghurts as I can’t eat eggs. Gluten free pastry and bread was nice but dear for 29 euro. My husband loved his choices at breakfast. 
Yes I would return again due to lovely staff staff, lovely room and amenities but I may skip breakfast due to above reason. ",5,2018,08,03
18,home away from home,"One of the best overall hotel experiences in the world. Amazingly helpful and friendly management and staff. Fantastic food. Curated room. Great private rooftop. Best location in town, steps from the heart of Barceloneta and the beach, from the Ramblas and the historic center, from any desirable shopping and dining experience. Just remarkable!!",5,2018,08,02
18,You won’t regret it!,One of the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Service begins as soon as you get out of your taxi. Provided with immediate comfort and with every need accommodated .... this place strive to take care of all your possible needs- make sure you include breakfast... incredible! The staff is the real reason why this place is one of the best hotels. Location is excellent. We were provided with a cellular phone to use to get around town and for instant access of internet and communication with hotel in case of emergency. I love this place and travel to Barcelona just to stay here and enjoy their amazing beautiful culture!,5,2018,08,01
18,Truth in Advertising!,"There's a reason The Serras is ranked the way it is on TripAdvisor - it's perfect:

A quintessential boutique / design hotel

Perfect location

Amazing rooftop bar and pool

We stayed here for one night at the end of our 10-day road trip to hit all five European microstates (we drove down from Andorra and flew out of Barcelona the next day).",5,2018,07,31
18,Lovely stay in Barcelona,"While the location of this boutique hotel is outstanding (as it's near Las Ramblas, the marina/beach, and on the edge of the spectacular Gothic Quarter), it is the staff that stands out here. Rodrigo and Daniel and the other stellar front desk staff greeted us by name every time we saw them in the lobby and offered restaurant tips, made reservations, and gave us directions, and went above and beyond in every way. The restaurant wait staff are professional and friendly as well. 

The top floor plunge pool and deck, while small, is the perfect spot to enjoy a hot afternoon in between sightseeing, touring, and exploring Barcelona.

The Serras is a special place, and we thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay. ",5,2018,07,30
18,Spectacular service Beautiful hotel,"This beautiful oasis sets the bar high for not only wonderful amenities but unrivaled service.  My husband and I arrived there in the midst of the taxi/Uber strike.  We had taken a train from Madrid and were forced to lug our 4 pieces of baggage up and down flights of stairs on the subway and along cobbled roads in 90 degree heat  to get to the hotel.  We arrived hot, sweaty and angry. The staff greeted us with cool water in cut crystal glasses, champagne and chocolate.During our stay, they greeted us by name and expressed real concern for our well being. (Note- The Serras staff first called to warn us two days before our arrival about the strike and give us directions to the hotel. Our luxury hotel in Madrid did not).

The room is modern and comfortable with all the amenities including  a cell phone for us to use while we were there. We were greeted by a lovely hand written note and some sweets artfully arranged The bed was very comfortable. Despite its excellent location close to the harbor and many restaurants, at night our room overlooking the street was completely quiet. Furthermore, the a/c in the room made the temperature perfect even though the weather outside was oppressively hot. 

We had cocktails on their rooftop terrace overlooking the city and an amazing dinner in their restaurant. As foodies from the Bay Area, we have been to many excellent restaurants and I would say this Michelin restaurant definitely deserves its stars. Again, the service was both impeccable and friendly.  The breakfast in the same location was also superb.

I agree with the other reviewer who noted that The Serras’ service takes real work and skill. It shows. Unfortunately, other calamities in addition to the taxi strike forced us to leave early. As we were boarding our plane, the hotel manager gave us a call. He was so very nice and we truly appreciated his effort and that of his staff. We were quite traumatized by what happened to us over a two day period outside of the hotel - his unexpected call way a lovely sendoff from Spain. If we ever return, we will stay at The Serras ",5,2018,07,30
18,Amazing.....,"To make this level of service so effortless takes a lot of effort & skill.... beautiful place to stay, & people there so helpful & friendly - they just want your stay to be the best & ours definitely was.
As fab a City Barca is, just couldn’t leave the rooftop terrace. Will be back!",5,2018,07,29
18,Fantastic ,"The Serras exceeded all of our expectations. The staff is excellent, friendly and very attentive. No details were forgotten from the restaurant recommendations, the quality and cleanliness of the rooms to the poolside service. Highly recommend this hotel. We will be back. ",5,2018,07,27
18,Miss it already!,"Your Hotel Team is quite possibly the most attentive, polite, and knowledgeable staff we've met in a hotel so far. We loved our room and the balcony. We had an amazing dinner sitting at the bar at Informal. We soaked up the sun and wine on The Rooftop. Breakfast each morning was exactly what we needed. Everything was perfect! 
Gracias!",5,2018,07,26

18,Home Away From Home,"The Serras Hotel in Barcelona is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.  My daughter
and I were showered with kindness. They  always greeted and offered us a beverage.  Our room was perfect.  We had a balcony with a view of Barcelona.  The hotel is about three years old and still looked brand new.  It was in the perfect location, close enough to walk to La Rambla Street yet just far away for privacy.   ",5,2018,07,17
18,Fabulous!,"Wonderful customer service from start to finish. Incredibly clean rooms (although ours was quite small - albeit we were aware of this when we booked, so not an issue), a very comfortable bed, great size bathroom and a cute little pool area. Delicious cocktails and buffet breakfast.",5,2018,07,17
18,Best town Boutique Hotel,"If you are looking for the best of the best one on one customer service this is the place to go!! The service is awesome the rooms the employees the food and the location are #1 in town.

18,Perfect!!!,"I hadn’t been back to Spain in almost 20 years and my husband had never been. We chose the Serras based on trip advisor reviews and it was fantastic in every way!! The location was ideal with views of the water, walking distance to the beach/marina, cathedral, boqueria market, Ramblas, sagrada familia and gothic shopping/amazing eats area. The level of service at this boutique hotel was amazing! The staff is so attentive and warm and welcoming. Andrea greeted us when we checked in and planned an entire itinerary for us (sightseeing/dinners), walked us around the hotel, got us cafe con leche and wished me a happy birthday! Breakfast each morning was impeccable and we were sent off with waters for the day and warm conversation! The rooftop pool/bar was perfect for relaxing and taking in the views of the city at any time of day! The room was perfect with large bathroom with rain shower and super comfortable king sized bed. I really can’t say enough about our stay in beautiful Barcelona and this impeccable hotel! ",5,2018,07,15
18,Trendy 5 Star Hotel in the Heart of Barcelona,"I appreciated that upon checkin the front desk staff was kind enough to walk us around the property including to the rooftop bar to show us the amenities. She took us through our room to make sure we were aware of the features of the room as well. The beds were very comfortable, which was a great thing for us to end a 2 week trip! The roof was fantastic with a pool and a great view of the harbor. The hotel location was very good, within walking distance of shopping and restaurants and only 20 minutes from the airport. The shower had an aroma therapy feature that we had never seen before and enjoyed using this treatment as well as taking a relaxing bath in the jet tub. Overall this hotel exceeded our expectations and would recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.",5,2018,07,15
18,The best Hotel in Barcelona,"The Serras is a fantastic hotel. The staff are the friendliest and most charming I have ever encountered (and I travel a lot!). from the Cava and chilled towels served on check in, to the bottle  awaiting you in your room, nothing is too much trouble for these guys. The hotel itself is chic and airy. There are very nice design touches everywhere. The roof terrace is a great way to unwind after a hectic day sightseeing with beautiful views of the the harbour . The breakfast and beverages are superb with hot selection and buffet choices available. A really special touch is the complimentary mobile phone in your room which allows you to download maps and other apps to help you navigate the city. it also has free international and local calls too!! never seen this before.The deluxe room are tastefully decorated, modern and cool. This is  an absolutely 1st  class boutique hotel. ",5,2018,07,14

The staff, the room, the food all perfect!
Located in the gothic area, pubs restaurants all in walking distance.
The restaurant inside the hotel is very good, we did not take breakfast.",5,2018,07,13
18,Fabulous stay ,"My husband and I just left The Serras after three incredible days. I’m not sure we’ve ever had such an incredible hotel experience. From the moment we arrived when Bea and the staff worked hard, without being asked, to get us into our room early, the feeling was one of such warmth and helpfulness.The rooms  are superb. It was a pull some days between the lovely space and crisp sheets, and on the other hand the allure of Barcelona! The location along the wide and open Paseig de Colom was glorious—easy walk into the gothic quarter but the hotel itself bathed in airy light. The food was also divine. But the most memorable thing is that the service was so personalized—we felt like part of the hotel family. We had a call from the hotel a week before we arrived asking whether the staff could help with anything. Upon arrival, the staff had terrific restaurant suggestions, and gave updates to the restaurants when we were late. We got last-minute help with museums and Sagrada Familia tickets—we should have booked, but forgot. They sorted it out with a smile. And each day Daniel was in the lobby with a sparkle in his eye and incredible tips and suggestions from beaches to bike rentals to shopping—all of them spot on. Thank you thank you!! We can’t recommend the hotel highly enough. ",5,2018,07,08
18,6 Star Boutique luxury ,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay in Barcelona. We stayed at Hotel Serras in the gothic area. 
From the moment we arrived at the hotel to be greeted by name to when we checked out, we could not have had a better experience. Cold towels and refreshments offered at check in. The staff went above and beyond to help us with tours and restaurants, nothing was a bother. 
The beds (the ones used in Buckingham Palace) to the complementary champagne and birthday cake in our room was 6 star. 
A gorgeous roof top pool and bar with unbelievable views of the marina. 
Aircon was cool and quite, this hotel has though of every creature comfort including double glazed windows to avoid any outside noises. 👌🏼 We could not fault one thing with this hotel. 
One word perfect. 
Thanks Diego and all of the staff at The Serras for making our trip to Barcelona such a memorable one. ",5,2018,07,08
18,Incredible hotel,"Everything about The Serra’s is wonderful. We were greeted at the curb, given welcome drinks and snacks as we checked in, as well as a complimentary bottle of cava. What a welcome! They booked excursions, restaurants and procured an “emergency” taxi when we were running late for a museum appointment. Michelin starred restaurant in the hotel and outstanding rooftop bar/restaurant which overlooks the city and harbor. The location is central to this amazing city on the Mediterranean. Rooms, beds, baths are well designed and extremely comfortable. I cannot wait to return to this hotel. ",5,2018,07,07
18,Fantastic Barcelona Hotel,"Unfortunately only one night here but enough to say it's absolutely lovely in every way. The stand out feature is the first class service from everyone we met. You are made to feel so welcome and cared for right down to the little touches, cooling flannels and a glass of delicious local crisp Cava, and everything you could possibly want in the exquisite rooms. The roof terrace is a jewel with its little cooling pool and spectacular view, and the fabulous food, modern Spanish, not a deep fried thing in sight. The genuine warmth, friendliness and just pure stylishness of this divine little hotel makes it the perfect place to stay. They are a model for good service and how to run a hotel - learn please other hotels!",5,2018,07,04

The food was delicious and the location was perfect to tour around Barcelona! Sergay, Andrea upstairs and the young ladies working breakfast were particular stand outs!",5,2018,07,03
18,Absolutely stay here,"A perfect location to enjoy Barcelona!  Walking distance to everything, safe area and NOT on las rambles, but a couple blocks walk.  We loved it.  The rooms were very comfortable, great bed and bathrooms were very large.  Rooftop bar and pool are a great way to relax after a day of walking the city. Staff went above and beyond in every way....really just a perfect stay!!",5,2018,07,02
18,Amazing hotel,"The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. The room was amazing. All the attention to detail was impressive. The room has double windows to keep city noise out, there is perfect control of the temperature, the room is super clean and modern, and the turn down service was wonderful. The location is perfect. One of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in. ",5,2018,07,01
18,Fantastic Hotel with Great Location and Staff,"Hotel The Serras has a lot going for it.   The location is excellent, it is close to the beach/marina, and close to all major tourist attractions in Barcelona (Las Ramblas, Sagrada Familia, etc.)   The hotel is run like a well-oiled machine but with great personality.   The staff are extremely friendly and really want to see you have a fun vacation in Barcelona.    We received many tips from Sandra (she is the restaurant breakfast manager) and had many great conversations with her about what to do next in Barcelona....can't thank you enough Sandra for your recommendations!     Do not hesitate to book a room in this hotel, it is pricier than some others but you get what you pay for and you will not regret it!     Also, the rooftop bar is a relaxing place with fantastic views.",5,2018,06,30
18,Rooftop Bar Birthday Celebrations,"We had an area reserved for our daughters 21st birthday on the El Sueno de Picasso which is the rooftop terrace on top of the Hotel Serras. The events team & coordinators, Paula, Cecilia & Melissa were amazing. They were very accommodating & worked to their best professional ability to cater for our needs including helping us choose the prepaid drinks & food.

The service & atmosphere on the evening was excellent. From the welcome by the staff in the reception area, a personal greeting from the area manager, to the staff that looked after us all during the event. We could not have been more delighted & the Hotel Serras & their staff thoroughly deserve their 5 star rating. Thank you.",5,2018,06,28
18,Perfect!,"The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was great, close to everything. I highly recommend the rooftop bar for cocktails! Also, their restaurant Informal had amazing food and a great atmosphere. ",5,2018,06,28
18,Incredible hotel,"The Serras is easily one of the best boutique hotels in the world. I’ve recently stayed at its closest competitors in Barcelona, and can confidently say The Serras outshines them all. Flawless design, flawless service, astonishing attention to detail. Don’t hesitate to book here if you want a literally perfect vacation.",5,2018,06,28
18,Top notch hotel but noisy,"The location is excellent, right on the waterfront and an easy walk to the Gothic quarter and Ras Lambras. The hotel is modern, trendy but our suite was disappointing: tiny seating area and a bleak view from the window onto other buildings. Although the windows are double glazed preventing any street noise, the acoustics within the hotel were awful. Paper thin walls so you could hear every noise from the adjoining room and the corridor. Also the door to the service area banged all night.

Having said that, the staff were incredibly attentive, especially Sandra, the restaurant manager, and Andreas in front of house. Breakfasts were delicious but the one dinner we had on the terrace was indifferent. The wifi was excellent....at last a hotel whose wifi doesn't switch off every couple of hours!

They have a fantastic roof terrace and bar overlooking the waterfront with a plunge pool. The seating for evening drinks was rather cramped; they should remove the poolside loungers at 6pm and replace with proper seating, or at least give residents precedence. They could review their dress code as well: shirtless men in the restaurant area for drinks.",3,2018,06,26
18,Outstanding,Outstanding hotel. We picked this hotel based on the trip advisor reviews and it did not disappoint. Boutique hotel with great amenities. The concierge services were outstanding. Rooms are great. Food was great. Rooftop bar/lounge was fantastic. Great location. Worth. Every. Penny. ,5,2018,06,26
18,Look No Further,"Every aspect of The Serras is top notch. From the perfect location to the incredible staff who daily went  above and beyond to make our stay in Barcelona a fantastic experience. The hotel prides itself on its customer service and they deliver 100%. Our room was modern, immaculate, and extremely  comfortable. After a full day in the city it was such a pleasure to relax in the amazing views off the roof top bar and pool area. The Serras is truly a home away from home and we are already looking forward to booking once again on our next trip.",5,2018,06,25
18,Excellent Stay in Barcelona,"We stayed at The Serras in a junior suite.  The room was a perfect size for our family and the location made everywhere we wanted to go within walking distance.  The hotel provided excellent customer service throughout our three night stay.  They arranged and rescheduled dinner reservations on multiple days.  The restaurant was also outstanding with amazing customer service and great food.  The evening before we departed, the front desk checked with us to see what our departure plans involved.  The next morning, they had a cab waiting and helped with our luggage and check out!  Truly, a memorable stay!",5,2018,06,25
18,"The Serras, is a Barcelona experience in of itself!","Amazing, from the rooftop pool/bar, our room, Informal (Serras Restaurant), the Lobby, 
the beautiful and professional staff. Like the title says, The Serras is a Barcelona experience in of itself!
Next time your in Barcelona, treat yourself to a drink on the rooftop bar....then you'll understand!",5,2018,06,25
18,Excellence!,"Hotel Les Serras is outstanding from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave. The staff is wonderful, anticipating every need and responding to every request. The hotel is located perfectly near the ocean and easy walking distance to all the neighborhoods. The rooms are well done, and very clean. If I returned to Barcelona I would stay at the Les Serras again but request a larger room.",5,2018,06,24
18,Comforatatobe stay!,"In speite of arrival in late at night, the staff welcomed us with smile. Every questions we made, they investigated and asnwered kindly. The scene and atomosphiere of roof top terrace was so nice and we enjoyed it.",5,2018,06,24
18,Top notch service,"The Serras offers a great location, amazingly comfortable beds and rooms, and the staff is top notch. 
While staying in Barcelona, I had the misfortune of needing to see a doctor. The doctor didn’t speak English, nor I Spanish or Catalan. The hotel staff called the doctor, set up my appointment and offered to translate over the phone once I arrived there. I couldn’t believe it. What service! And they offered all of this without any hint of inconvenience.
Thank you for everything. We highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat!",5,2018,06,23
18,Just Wonderful!,"We found this hotel on Tripadvisor but booked with another provider as we got a slightly better deal (sorry Tripadvisor). 

The Serras looked great in the pictures online and the TA reviews gave us confidence it would meet expectations. 

Arrived much later than we should, after enduring PlebAir (aka Ryanair), because our plane was very late collecting us from Stansted. Grrrr.

Took an Orange and Black taxi from El Prat airport. Only cost €25.00 Euro door to door for two people with luggage, with very helpful taxi driver who spoke better English than my Spanish :). Great value and an impromptu tourist guide en route! What a star!

The welcome at the hotel was a Wow! Hot scented towels to freshen up and a glass of bubbles whilst we booked in. Absolutely wonderful presentation of the hotel by the concierge, explaining it’s location and taking us through a free map of where all the sights to see in Barcelona were in relation to The Serras. Outstanding way to start your stay!

Our 3rd floor room (there is a nice lift to take you there) was lovely, with a massive super king bed, Bose radio, Nespresso coffee maker, mini bar, hairdryer, big flat screen TV, great en suite private shower room and relaxing fresh simple decor. Spacious without being wasteful.

Room 307 was at the back of the hotel overlooking an alleyway, which turned out to be the first of many wonderful streets that wind their way through the famous Gothic Quarter. There was a tiny Juliet balcony, from which I took some super pictures of locals and tourists enjoying their day.

After unpacking ( there was plenty of in room storage space), we logged onto the free Wi-fi (very good band width) and made use of the plentiful plug points from which to charge laptops and phones etc.

Then we ventured up to the rooftop bar and restaurant. Superb views over the harbour and docks and the Passag De Colomb, a super wide avenue which is alive with people and traffic 24 hours a day. It just felt so alive, sitting up there with a great G&T looking at people wandering along the massive walkways and seeing all the millionaires motor yachts in the marina. 

There is a small splash pool set in the decking, that almost tempted me...

Staff in the bar were amazing. We also ate in the adjoining open rooftop restaurant during our stay. Food was fab, service was fantastic and really good value.

We had an evening meal in Informal, the Michelin starred ‘in house’ restaurant on the ground floor. 

The wonderfully varied and inviting menu was innovative and catered for all tastes and dietary requirements, including gluten free (essential for us). The food was just amazing. It’s a little pricey, but to be honest, it reflected the quality of the ingredients, amazing presentation of every course/dish and was actually very good value for my money.

You also have your breakfast in the same restaurant , which again was really outstanding, even though I had a couple of instances where I got something other than that which I ordered.

The staff - I mean EVERY single one of them - are so well trained, courteous, helpful and literally go to extraordinary lengths to look after you as a guest. We have been fortunate to stay in some of the world’s top hotels, so I was delighted to be really impressed with the service, friendliness and unflappable care with which we were entreated.

The hotel is perfect to enjoy the best of the city, it’s a short walk from the end of the amazing La Rambla, which is a ‘must visit’ when in Barcelona.

The Serras made our 4 day stay in Barcelona intensely memorable in the very best way, and will definitely be where we stay when we return to this beautiful city.

Thank you to everyone in the team at The Serras. A hotel experience at its very best.

18,"Excellent, accommodating hotel","I only had the chance to stay at the Serras for two days but I loved my time there. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The location and property were both top notch, and my wife and I had a lovely dinner at the restaurant there. I can not recommend this property highly enough. ",5,2018,06,22
18,The Best of Barcelona,"The moment I walked in, I knew this was a special place. The room was spacious with a modern, clean design. The staff was pleasant and friendly. The restaurant served wonderful breakfast and dinner. The location of the hotel was very good, sort of half way between the old (Gothic) quarter and new part of the city. My room had a beautiful sunrise. The complimentary bottle of Cava was the icing on the cake. I'd stay here and again and give this hotel my highest recommendation.",5,2018,06,21
18,An outstanding hotel,"We couldn’t speak highly enough of the Serras.  The service throughout is outstanding from the initial welcome drink to the offer to book a taxi on the night before departure.  Everyone is welcoming and genuinely helpful and friendly.  The room was well appointed with excellent shower, toiletries by Malin & Goetz, great quiet air conditioning, amazingly comfortable bed and virtually no street noise despite being at the front of the hotel on a busy road. The food both at breakfast and dinner is exceptional.  A really wonderful place to stay in Barcelona. 
",5,2018,06,21
18,Weekend trip to Barcelona,Fabulous hotel and the service by the staff was superb! From the moment we arrived in the hotel the staff couldn't do enough for us with welcoming drinks and cold towels to the impressive breakfast in the morning. The rooftop terrace was beautiful and relaxing. Would highly revommend.,5,2018,06,19
18,Amazing hotel in a great location,The service was impeccable and every detail was well thought out.  The hotel staff was simply amazing in every regard.  Our room was beautiful and well appointed.  We could not have had a better stay.  We will choose The Serras Hotel every time we visit Barcelona!!,5,2018,06,18
18,Wonderful ,One of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. Staff so friendly and attentive. Lots of nice little touches in room. Although on a main road we couldn’t hear any traffic from room.

18,"Small, luxury hotel in Barcelona","My husband and I stayed at the Serras for 5 nights in June. I booked directly from the hotel website at the breakfast inclusive rate. I recommend that you do this as the breakfast was exceptional! You are given a bowl of fruit, juice and pasties (from France) when you arrive. Hot dishes are included but can be ordered from the menu. My favourite was the healthy sandwich. Our room was on the 2nd floor and overlooked a small laneway. The doors onto the balcony are very solid and there was no noise from outside when closed. The shower was great, huge rain head and lovely toiletries. The rooftop bar was a great place to sit in the afternoon with a drink. The hotel is in the Gothic area and we walked to most of the sights but taxis were plentiful out front. This is not a cheap hotel but absolutely worth it! Next visit to Barcelona I will definitely book the Serras again.",5,2018,06,15
18,A faultless Hotel experience.,"What makes this hotel exceptional is: the location, the quality of the hotel's amenities (room, bathroom, lounge area, rooftop pool and bar), the food! - and especially the excellent level of service from the staff. The quality of the breakfast is sensational and the breakfast waitstaff are fantastic. A particular highlight of the hotel room is the bed - the most comfortable you'll find anywhere. Our five days at The Serras was not long enough and we can't wait to return in the future. The Serras staff made our stay memorable.",5,2018,06,15
18,Perfection,"Situated in a wonderful location overlooking Port Vell and walking distance of Las Ramblas, this hotel offers a truly wonderful experience.
Special mention must be made of the highly professional, warm and friendly staff. We’re missing their smiles already!
A truly wonderful hotel and if it’s within your budget I wouldn’t recommend anywhere else in Barcelona.
Can’t wait to return.",5,2018,06,15
18,Best hotel experience,"Located close to the port, the beautiful hotel The Serras provided the best hotel experience I can think of. Genuine super friendly staff and a rooftop to die for. Even if the hotel is extremely beautiful and cool, I think the great staff did it for me. Would love to come back one day.",5,2018,06,13
18,"Exceptional staff, clean rooms, perfect location","Exceptional staff, clean rooms, perfect location. We would recommend The Serras to any friends traveling to Barcelona. You won't go without a warm welcome, lovely rooftop, and thoughtful dinner suggestions with ease of booking through the concierge. Get lost in the Gothic Quarter right behind the hotel. We'll be back!",5,2018,06,11
18,Great staff and superb hotel,"Sandra the Breakfast manager always made my day, she was professional, friendly and always in such a great mood... I will come back just to see her smile every morning. Sandra was also very helpful and knowledge about the city and how and where to go",5,2018,06,11
18,Excellent hotel with high level of service,"We loved The Serras Hotel. It is in a fantastic location, close to the gothic quarter, Barceloneta, and La Ramblas with stunning views over Port Vell. The hotel prides itself on a high level of service and I can say without doubt this was exemplified throughout our stay. From check in we were made to feel very welcome, with a personal tour of the hotel and our room and lots of info on nearby sights and things to do and best places to eat and drink. The room was very comfortable and stylish. Rooms are not huge but definitely spacious enough for a couple to enjoy. Truly one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at.",5,2018,06,10
18,THE BEST BOUTIQUE HOTEL-BARCELONA ,"The rooms, rooftop, dining room, location and all of this complemented by the best hotel staff ever!  Don’t Miss this Experience!! 
I travel a lot and this experience was remarkable and it set a new standard for a boutique hotel which is my preferred type of Hotel worldwide. ",5,2018,06,08
18,Boutique and special .,"The attention paid in selecting the beautiful girls who work here is second to none and worth visiting the Serras for that alone !
Situated in a position allowing easy access to the city centre, beaches, good restaurants etc., the hotel offers that little bit extra for the discerning client . Staff are some of the best we have ever encountered , in all categories and have a wonderful friendliness and warmth. Very good restaurant, pleasant roof terrace, comfortable rooms and the hotel does offer that little bit extra. This is not a moderately priced hotel yet is well worth a visit even if it is only to stay for a section of your holiday and allow yourself the opportunity to stay in a truly boutique hotel which offers that little extra with a wonderful touch of class.",4,2018,06,08
18,An excellent experience,"The Serras is a beautiful boutique hotel with friendly, helpful staff.  Their rooftop deck is delightful. Centrally located within walking distance to the marina. Our room was nicely appointed, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,06,07
18,Wouldn’t stay any other place!,"From the moment our limo service dropped us off, until we checked out, The Serras treated us as valued guests. 
 The location is perfect. The staff is friendly and bend over backwards to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.
 ",5,2018,06,07
18,"Beautiful, luxurious hotel in a great location","This is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff. The first person to greet us was Sergio. He was so warm and sincere, and we felt like he was our personal concierge throughout our stay! The service is very personalized and the ambiance is very intimate due to the small size of the hotel. The staff was so warm, welcoming, and helpful with directions, suggestions, and all kinds of assistance. The room was super clean, modern, quiet, and comfortable. The climate control in each room is high tech, super quiet, and very efficient. The housekeeping staff did a great job as well. The turndown service was very nice. We were welcomed with some lovely snacks when we arrived and were greeted each evening with nice treats on the nightstand. This is a luxurious hotel with the attentive staff to match. I would recommend it without hesitation and would certainly stay there again next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2018,06,06
18,Cool hotel and friendly staff,"Everything was nice and really attractive.  Love the library that has a button to push if you want a drink and the rooftop bar is great.  Location fantastic as well, lots of thing in the area.  Another very nice feature is a cell phone provided to take around with you for internet access and international calls.  The staff recommend the best restaurant we experienced our entire 10 day stay.  ",5,2018,06,05
18,Excellent. The best hotel in Barcelona,"From start to finish the service is excellent. 
The staff are very genuine and seem to really enjoy giving good service. 
Its at a great location too for the city or the beach and has great views from rooftop bar too. Hotel is pure class",5,2018,06,04
18,"Great staff, excellent location","This hotel has the best staff I've seen in any hotel in Europe. The location is also excellent. The rooms are also really nice and comfortable. But for the price, the hotel's breakfast is too limited and the building is rather small.   ",4,2018,06,03
18,Great Service - Great Location,"We loved staying at the Serra.It's a small boutique hotel in a fabulous location.  The Service is unparalleled - from the front desk with incredible amount of information, guidance and support as well as  the dining room staff and the housekeeping staff.  Our only complaint is the rooms, although well appointed were small with an exceptionally high price. Overall, I would have to say we were VERY satisfied.",4,2018,06,02
18,Amazing Hotel in an Amazing City,From the moment we booked our time at the Serras until it was time to leave every experience was about as easy and perfect as it could be.  A beautiful boutique hotel staffed with truly amazing people.,5,2018,05,31
18,Barcelona,"fantastic views from the terrace, great friendly staff always accommodating and helpful, when ever I come back to Barcelona I will stay at the Serras, it was one of the best trips I had in a long time Thank you",5,2018,05,31

Breakfast was delicious, there were adequate spaces for relaxing or working in the hotel, which is nice.  The location is also very good.",5,2018,05,30
18,Perfection!,"This is an amazing hotel with a fabulous location near the water and the gothic and born neighborhoods.  The rooms were spacious, quiet, really clean but the service was phenomenal. We were greeted by name every time we returned to the hotel and every person was so friendly and helpful. There is also a really nice rooftop bar that has a perfect view of Barcelona. I highly recommend this hotel!!",5,2018,05,28
18,This place is the best,Thank you to all the wonderful staff at The Serras. We had 3 amazing days in Barcelona made all the better for our stay in this great hotel. The restaurant was amazing for both breakfast and dinner. The rooms immaculate and the rooftop bar a haven to come back to each afternoon. We can’t wait to return,5,2018,05,28
18,Six stars - AMAZING staff,"We cannot praise this hotel enough. We stayed for 6 nights on vacation and truly enjoyed the experience. Let us walk you through our stay: 

1. We (2 adults, 1 child under 3) arrived from the airport. A staff member rushed outside to take all of our luggage. ALL of it, insisting we carry nothing. While we checked in, we were treated to mocktails, warm towels and our son to some chocolate and a toy car. Guess what - he liked the hotel immediately. And so did we.

2. In our room, an iced bottle of Cava was awaiting us. The room was immaculately made up, the bathroom spacious and intelligently designed (e.g, the shower was elongated so the water stays inside, with an easy to understand buttons for rainshower). The staff had not just put a random wood child crib in there, but a proper kid's bed with the same soft linen (yes, it's used in Buckingham palace as well) which our son LOVED and helped us continue his sleeping routine.

3. The reception staff was uniformly friendly, well trained and went out of their way to help us understand the city, plan our days, book restaurants, and overall feel good.  Thank you Jan (high five!), Bea (thank you for explaining the city so well), Sergio Alexandra, and everyone else (I wish we wrote down all the names - this is our fault, since everyone was great).

4. Our first evening, we went to a restaurant the hotel recommended (for tapas). The food was excellent. Our tip: listen to the staff, every restaurant recommendation was on point and helpful, which is important as a LOT of restaurants in Barcelona look nice but serve terrible food (I apologize but trust me - it's true). 

4. The breakfast and especially Sandra, the breakfast manager, was supreme. Talk about expertly taking care of your customer, remember exactly what we had and anticipating what we wanted. For instance, she brought our son a ""babycino"", i.e. foamed milk without coffee. Not just the selection (both smart dishes a la carte and a buffet option) - for instance, the fruit bowl was a perfect healthy choice, and the yoghurts out of this world delicious. But the breakfast experience as run by Sandra is reason alone to give this hotel 5 stars (frankly, 6) and come back even though you only wanted to visit Barcelona once. Sandra, thank you!

5. This kind of excellent starts at the top: we found staff to be uniformly trained at incredibly high standards, which included everyone greeting us by our names (even though we hadn't met them before), seamless housekeeping without us noticing, and arranging our checkout so elegantly as a ""by the way"" conversation. The general manager, it seemed, was always present and checking with staff to keep things running smoothly. Great service is always a function of great managament!

6. We should also mention the amazing roof bar and terrance, and the wonderful hostess upstairs (I am so sorry we forgot to remember your name). The pool, while more for ambience than swimming, together with the tree in the middle of the roof made us feel so relaxed (and cool and hip even though we are parents) that we almost didn't want to leave the hotel. 

7. In summary, this is an extraordinarly well run gem of a hotel, with staff that treat their guests with warmth, and an overall experience that has little to do with money (the value was excellent) or hardware (the room was flawless) or a shampoo (we loved the brand used), but more with a fundamental understanding of what matters in hospitality: how the guest feels.

We have travelled in every continent and stayed in more than a few of the world's best hotels (judged as leading by whichever guide you fancy). 

For us, this was one of the best hotel stays, if not the best. One thing is for sure: The Serras wins hands down in the category ""attitude"".

Thank you!",5,2018,05,27
18,Serras,"The Serras was amazing. The staff were professional but extremely friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The rooms were amazing and the roof top bar was awesome, views to die for. Prime location. The whole experience was perfect from start to finish. My husband had the best birthday and we celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary in style thanks to everyone at the Serras",5,2018,05,27
18,Child-free escape,"This hotel has just about everything you’d want from a city boutique hotel - attentive and friendly service, a smart, well-designed room with a comfortable bed and fab shower, excellent location, cool roof-top bar, tapa and cava on arrival. Just perfect as a base to explore the city’s culture and fantastic food. Hope to come back again soon. ",5,2018,05,26
18,Boat envy,"A really lovely place to stay, just a short walk to Las Ramblas and the assorted cultural attractions. Our room faced over the marina which was littered with super yachts. The closest about €100mn apparently. 
Anyway the room was modern and well appointed. Very comfortable bed and a great bathroom with a huge shower (no bath). 
Cool roof top bar with a (very small) plunge pool. 
Breakfast was really very nice, and the duck rice dish at dinner was very tasty too. 
Staff and service all very professional, helpful and friendly - greet you by name etc when you come in. 
Would go back in a heart beat. ",5,2018,05,24
18,Luxury in a perfect location,"Friendly staff, nothing too much trouble, we were treated so well. Roof top terrace an added bonus with terrific views and again, excellent service. Perfect location for walking out to enjoy the many facilities Barcelona has to offer.",5,2018,05,24
18,Pure Bliss,"On our first voyage to Barcelona, we decided to go with a top notch hotel.  The Serras was recommended to us and did not disappoint.

If you have the budget for it this is a great hotel.",5,2018,05,23
18,Perfection in Barcelona,"If you have even the slightest hesitation about booking this hotel, JUST BOOK IT! 

My husband and I were in Spain for our 30th birthdays last week and we spent two nights at The Serras. Simply put, it is a perfect hotel.

The location is wonderful - bordering the Barri Gotic, El Born and El Raval neighborhoods but also easily walkable to Eixample. 

The beds, which apparently are from the same company that does the beds at Buckingham Palace, are truly heavenly. The rooms are well appointed, comfortable and luxurious. We were given a welcome gift, a personalized welcome note, and delicious sweet treats every night. Your room also comes with an international cell phone, with which you can make any international call or take with you to use for maps or wifi while out and about in the city. The service is unparalleled and truly remarkable. So friendly and helpful, without any feeling of stuffiness. 

Finally, the food. Informal is quite possibly one of the very best restaurants we've ever eaten at, period. Just a wonderful meal. And the drinks and snacks on the rooftop are also a great treat.

Don't hesitate to make this your temporary home in Barcelona - you will not regret it!",5,2018,05,21
18,Outstanding service at a great location,"We were so grateful for the help the staff gavein finding places we wanted to visit, in getting taxis and looking out for any and all needs. Sandra in the breakfast room was Sandra was charming and considerate even sendingup a little breakfast basket when oneone of us was ill.",5,2018,05,21
18,Great boutique hotel in an excellent location,"Service couldn't have been better. The facilities are spotless. Definitely have a drink at the rooftop bar next to the small pool and watch people strolling along the beach.

We had a standard room at the back of the hotel which felt a little small and dark for the price though it was F1 weekend so perhaps this is to be expected. In any case, I'd be happy to stay again.",5,2018,05,16
18,Wow just wow!,"We have just spent an amazing weekend at this fabulous hotel. I cannot praise the staff highly enough - their level of customer service is in another league. They are extremely professional, courteous and welcoming and made us feel so relaxed. The hotel is in a fabulous location just on the edge of the gothic quarter - a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas, the beautiful cafes of Placa Reial or the marina/beaches of Barceloneta depending on what direction you take when you finally drag yourself out of your comfortable room (the beds are to die for!) or down from the rooftop bar/pool area. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be returning!",5,2018,05,11
18,The most amazing Boutique hotel in Barcelona,From the moment we arrived and throughout the next five days the service from every member of staff was incredible. During check in we were asked what time in the morning and evening we would like our room cleaned and without fail are room was cleaned when we were out. My wife and I have travelled extensively staying in some of the best hotels in the world and The Serras is without any doubt on the list of our best hotels in the world. Our bedroom had all the comforts of a 5* hotel and was cleaned twice per day to a very high standard.,5,2018,05,08
18,Incredible Hotel with Incredible service,"Very comfortable location, personalised service and amazing food with very good wine selection.

18,5star luxury boutique hotel,"We are staying here for 5 days and loving this luxury boutique hotel. Superb location . Friendly welcoming staff. Wonderfully designed throughout, beds super comfortable. Fabulous breakfast and great choice of evening dining. Impressive rooftop bar with plunge pool where you can relax and enjoy the sea views. Top quality bathroom products. Everything is 5star and more!  we will definitely return! Thank you Le Serras🤗",5,2018,05,02
18,Great location and service,"My partner and I only stayed one night before taking a Mediterranean cruise. We were very impressed by the staff's hospitality, and the hand-held device with complimentary internet and phone calls was very useful. We would definitely stay again!",5,2018,05,01
18,The Serra’s was the best experience hands down!,Wow what a fabulous hotel and staff. Perfect location in Barcelona right near the water and the Gothic quarter. Easy to get everywhere! Beautiful property with a lovey roof top bar and relaxation oasis after a busy day. The biggest star of this hotel is the staff!!! They went above and beyond to assist us with anything we needed. They far exceeded our expectations in every way possible. We are now in Seville at The Alphonso Hotel which is stunning but my first impression is that the staff friendliness and helpfulness is not even comparable to The Serra’s. It’s a 5 Star Hotel as well but in this area I would have to give The Serra’s a 10. You can’t go wrong!,5,2018,04,30
18,One of the best,"We’ve just enjoyed a two night stay at Hotel The Serras.  We chose it purely on reviews, and found it was well deserving of its 5 star rating.  Perfectly positioned in Barcelona at the foot of the Gothic Quarter overlooking the sea.  The staff were attentive, but not intrusive, polite and friendly.  All staff had excellent customer service and definitely contribute largely to the 5* rating we have given.  The rooms were comfortable, spacious, and well designed.  We dined in the hotel’s Michelin starred restaurant ‘El Informal’ which was utterly divine.  Local and produce perfectly presented and delicious. There is a rooftop bar with plunge pool which serves tapas style lunches and great cocktails.  We would thoroughly recommend Hotel The Serras, and will definitely be returning.",5,2018,04,30
18,Exquisite with exceptional service and modern style,"We stayed at this adorable boutique hotel for two nights before debarking on a 10 day Mediterranean cruise.   The sevice is amazing from the moment you walk into the hotel until checkout.   Rooms are spacious, spotless, modern, and new :).  We stayed in a room overlooking the marina which was breathtaking.",5,2018,04,29
18,Dr,"The Serras, what can I say? A short but fantastic stay. From the welcome by Daniel at the taxi to Daniel organising and making sure we got in our taxi to return on time, the whole trip was fantastic.
The hotel, location, decour, feel, mood, people, services – its all 5 star.
But, the most important and defining feature that makes this hotel so amazing, is the people.
I’m sorry I don’t remember names very well but I want to make sure everyone we met knows how amazing they are.
Daniel met us at our taxi, immediately knowing who we were by name. That small touch, making things personal goes a long way. The fresh juice, the choclates and the personal tour of Barcelona using the map was so perfect and helpful.
A trainee was with Daniel at the time, may I just say she was so pleasant, respectful and professional. Clearly the Serras recruits the right people.
The lady in the breakfast area, who adored our son Yusuf and who went the extra mile to ensure his allergies were not a problem for him to eat. Yusuf loved her and kept calling her aunty. 
And to everyone who smiled, gave our son a high five and made him feel loved, we are grateful.
O and the Serras Hippo, Yusuf’s new best friend, that was fantastic.
You are all a credit to the Serras, Barcelona and the hotel industry. Keep up the fantastic work and hope to see you again some time

Best wishes

Dr Asad Ashraf and family

18,"Wow, just wow!","This is hands down one of the most stellar hotels we have ever stayed at. The service is exceptional and the hotel all around exceeds expectations.

From the moment you check in to the time you leave you feel like royalty. Even before you leave from home they reach out to see if you need anything and once there they do whatever they can to be of assistance. 

Every aspect of the place is wonderful. The rooms are great, the restaurant is fantastic, the rooftop bar is amazing, and the staff just consistently blew us away. 

There is no other hotel in Barcelona that we will stay at. The service and location are a win all around!!! A new favorite.",5,2018,04,20
18,"Amazing hotel, amazing vacation!!","Would highly recommend to anyone going to Barcelona, to stay at The Serras if you can. The location is perfect, as is the hotel itself. Extremely friendly and energetic staff, always anticipating your every need. The guest rooms are lovely and very comfortable. The restaurant is small, elegant and the food is excellent! The rooftop bar is a must, very romantic and the view is tremendous. Best vacation we’ve ever had!",5,2018,04,20
18,The perfect spot,"This hotel offers all you need for a perfect visit to Barcelona. Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, great food, wine and drinks. And the rooftop is just excellent! You have the best view of Barcelona from here. ",5,2018,04,19
18,"Helpful staff, modern rooms","The Serras offers everything you will need for your trip to Barcelona. The staff are extremely helpful and answered all my questions promptly via email prior to my arrival. They assisted with booking activities for us and also with buying tickets to watch Barcelona play at camp nou! 

The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable and you are also within walking distance to most of the main attractions 

Would highly recommend this place ",5,2018,04,18
18,Modern and well designed!,"Our stay at The Serras was too short! We were there only for one night, but would love to come back soon. The location was wonderful. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the bathrooms were to die for with fantastic lighting and some of the best bathroom designs I've ever seen. The staff was absolutely wonderful, from the front desk to the maid service to the restaurant to the transportation. We will definitely stay there again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2018,04,17
18,Amazing hotel - true luxury with the 5* service and staff to back it up,"I can’t describe how good this hotel is other than to say we stayed three nights and next time we will stay at least four or five!! 

The staff are absolutely amazing and are always around checking that your needs are attended to. Every time you request something whether it is a bottle of water, printing or assistance with transport they are so willing to help and nothing is ever too much of an ask for them. It’s just incredible service in every part of the hotel and we didn’t encounter one person who was anything less than warm and helpful.

The spaces available to guests (the mezzanine floor and the roof) add so much to the hotel and you can just start or finish your evenings with a few drinks in either. 

The rooms are perfectly appointed and the bathrooms (shower in particular) live up to the luxury the hotel aims for.

Overall I can’t fault anything about the Serras and we will be returning as soon as possible!",5,2018,04,15
18,Perfect hotel,"The hotel has a great location, amazing world-class staff and service, beautifully appointed rooms, hip and cozy rooftop bar, and a breakfast you'll never forget - need I say more? Alright - the beds are really comfortable, the hotel provides you with a local cellphone preloaded with maps and free international calls. The gym is small but has an amazing variety of weights and mats. The staff will help you with any reservation snafu, while you sip a coffee or orange juice and chill.",5,2018,04,15
18,Wonderful Hotel and Staff!!!,"I cannot say how much this place “wowed” us. First off, communication prior to our visit was very great and prompt. I am traveling with my family so we wanted adjoining rooms. We also arranged for private transport to the hotel. Upon arrival to the hotel we were treated so kindly and with such a warm welcome for us and the kids—juice and whatever drinks and a warm hand towel while we checked in. During our entire stay, all employees were so kind and great, and even would greet us by name and always with a smile. And it wasn’t a fake or forced smile—but it always felt they were very genuine. The hotel is wonderful—great aromas and beautiful interior design and details. The rooms are also beautiful—we had a suite and another room with a separate entrance that then had 2 doors behind it for each room, which is so great when traveling with a family and small children. The beds were great and the pillows are the best I’ve ever had in any hotel in my life—not exaggerating. Our suite was beyond description with a bathtub in the sitting room and wonderful views of the boats and sea. The shower and water pressure were also perfection. We had breakfast included in our stay—tasty options to choose from and fresh fruits as well as an option to order a hot dish. It was very great and our kids loved it. A huge thank you to the lovely and wonderful staff of The Serras and the general manager who made our stay one that we will never forget. We stayed here for four nights and then left to travel elsewhere for a few nights and are lucky enough to return for one final night before we leave back home. One last thing is that I loved staying in this area. After walking around Barcelona and seeing where some of the other hotels are located, the location of the Serras was away from all the hustle and noise that you get elsewhere. ",5,2018,04,12
18,Amazing Personal Touches!,"We stayed only one night on our way to catch a cruise ship, but would not hesitate to return or recommend.  From the multiple contacts by email and phone prior to arrival, to the personal welcome by staff on arrival, it’s clear that the Serras is committed to providing an outstanding level of care and support. 

Our room was contemporary, with a king bed, rain shower and double sinks. Free, fast WiFi, smart phone in the room for guest use, amenities, mini bar - all one could need. 

The restaurant, “Informal” by name, served up a wonderful Catalan rice, and a perfectly grilled red snapper. Great choice of appetizers and mains, and everyone around us was delighted with their meals as well.

It’s hard to say enough about the quality of the staff and their professionalism - among the finest we’ve seen. 

Five star recommendation!",5,2018,04,08
18,Amazing stay at The Serras,"We were in Barcelona to visit our daughter who is studying abroad. Based on Trip Advisor reviews, we chose The Serra’s.  Wow.  What an incredible luxury hotel. This is all about the staff.  Just amazing.  My wife and I travel quite a bit for work and pleasure and not sure any hotel tops this!!!!
Everyone knows your name, greet you warmly, will do anything if you ask and go out of their way to treat you like kings and queens.  
First - room was ready at 12 noon.  They also had a tapas plate and cava with a nice welcome note about visiting our daughter and my wife’s birthday. Second - rooftop bar is a must visit.  Third - informal rest outstanding.  And finally they left a piece of cake in our room on my wife’s birthday. 
An incredible stay - due mainly to the staff.  If ever back in Barcelona we will 100 be back at Serra’s.",5,2018,04,07
18,Our Home Away From Home,"If I could rate this hotel 10 stars I would! From the stylish décor, to the amazing food, to the impeccable service, The Serras does not disappoint. The staff is extremely warm, friendly, and helpful. Rodrigo in particular helped us book everything we wanted to do during our 7-day stay, from museum tickets to dinner reservations to last minute train tickets to Madrid! We are so appreciative for his help as it was our first time in Barcelona and we did not have much background knowledge. Additionally, the location is just perfect as the hotel is close to all of the attractions as well as many great restaurants and bars. If you decide to stay here, prepare to be pampered!",5,2018,04,05
18,superhotel!,"we hade swiming pool, a terrace with great views to the port, we had a lot of servives, gym, sauna spa, etc was very close city centre to visit most monument, (not sagrada familia) people in the hotel help us a lot and try to recommend different activities",5,2018,04,03
18,Feels like home,"You can find luxury in many hotels. But luxury can be cold and distant if the hotel is not run by heart. Hotel The Serras has a big heart! What makes them unique is the perfect mix of excellence in service, stylish environment and friendly attitude. Don't miss the rooftop bar and a dinner in its Informal Restaurant.",5,2018,04,01
18,Do they have Six Star Hotels?,"Stayed two nights last week based on Trip Advisor reviews. Was not disappointed - the Serra is what 1st class is expected to be. 

The service is quiet, professional, yet personal: thank you Andrea, Saundra, Daniel. Especially enjoyed the check-in with the champagne and hot towel!

I had a standard room and it was quite fine. Very nice bed. Good sized shower and water pressure. Nice to soak after a long day. It is Europe so the rooms tend to be smaller but all here was very clean, well thought out, and new.

Food is very good. In house restaurant has a Michelin star I heard. I ate dinner out but breakfast was very good. 

The differentiating value of the Serra’s is the ambiance in my mind - it’s the sum of a modern but very comfortable boutique hotel, the location, the well trained and friendly staff. You will leave feeling spoiled and wanting to come back.",5,2018,03,25
18,The only hotel you should consider in Barcelona,"Don't consider the Serras unless you are expecting amazing service, great rooms and perfect location.  A seven star experience!  Gothic quarter is full of history, restaurants and bars.  Las Ramblas minutes away.",5,2018,03,22
18,Perfect experience start to finish,"We had a wonderful experience on our recent trip to Barcelona.  From arrival to departure, everything was impeccable, friendly and beautiful.  We enjoyed our room with a great rain shower. The rooftop bar was cozy and stunning and the restaurant was much delicious for dinner.  We will be back!",5,2018,03,21
18,Awesome hotel!,"I stayed at The Serras two weeks ago and it was such a wonderful experience.  Before I even arrived, I received two phones calls and an email asking if I had any special requests.  The service was wonderful, the hotel was gorgeous and the staff went above and beyond.  The location was also fantastic.  I would recommend this property to anyone heading to Barcelona.  Thank you to everyone at the Serras for making my stay exceptional.",5,2018,03,20
18,If you want to be pampered...,"I passed this hotel several times when visiting Barcelona for work, it always looked like a very nice place. Spent 2 nights here now, and it proved my feeling was right. As from entering the hotel, you feel very welcome. Staff is very attentive and cooperating, the rooms are clean and very quiet, thanks to the extra set of windows, street noise can hardly get in the room.
Great roof terrace with a decent bar, a small pool and some sunbeds, again with perfect service by experienced staff. 
And with a great view over the waterfront.

Top quality breakfast, with the best local products and an open kitchen. Next time over we are going to try the restaurant in the evening. If breakfast is that good, dinner or lunch must be too.

Directly behind the hotel, one of the most charming areas of Barcelona start with some proper and authentic tapa bars with few tourists, mostly locals (or at least Spanish or Catalan) where you can eat simple but very nice food for little money. 

Not cheap, but worth the money.",5,2018,03,14
18,JUST THE BEST ONE,"We are the frequent travellers, always staying in 4-5stars hotel, but this hotel is just our favourite. When need to rest we choose Barcelona just for this hotel atmosphere, stuff and food in restaurant. Everyone smiles, helps you in your needs and problems, treat you very individual and special way. Hotel is 5stars but you can feel comtortable. Housekeeping comes twice a day and leaves you some sweet snack and fresh water. Food in restaurant is so good that you don’t want to eat anywhere else. They remember what you like and what you can’t eat. Localization is great as well, hotel is situated next to port, 10minutes walk to the beach and 15 minutes to shopping centre el corte ingles and main street with luxury stores.”",5,2018,03,12
18,Another Beautiful Stay,"After last year’s amazing experience I decided to come back to this hotel. I made sure to book way in advance to not miss it. Something about this hotel makes me feel at home. It has every right after travelling over the last year and this year to a couple of other destinations this hotel tops them all. Even my friends who stayed in the hotel in this trip say that the most they will miss about Barcelona is the Serras. The staff are not only friendly they make you feel like you are at home and take care of everything and make sure every single thing with no exception is beyond perfect. They greet you every time and sincerely ask how everything was and how they could help not just something to get out of the way as a checklist that other big brand hotels do. They are like a well functioning family that everyone goes above and beyond to make sure everything is perfection at its finest form. The hotel has the quietest most comfortable rooms, a mattress that you never want to get out of, food that is made with love, and staff that are like family. 

One year after my first stay and the Serras is the best hotel by far.  ",5,2018,02,28
18,Wonderful Hotel!,"The Serras is absolutely wonderful!  This is a beautiful hotel with an amazing staff.  Our trip included breakfast which was delicious, egg white omelette made to order.  Every night there was a different sweet treat next to the bed.  A beautiful roof deck with a great view and drinks.  I would stay here again on my next visit to Barcelona.",5,2018,02,26
18,Stay here!,"Best ever hotel!!! We had an amazing experience here. The staff and property were outstanding. Great location, easy walk to all the highlights. Very divserve clientele....recommend without any reservation.",5,2018,02,26
18,At Home in Barcelona,"I recently spent a week at The Hotel Serras.  If you're planning a trip to Barcelona and you like boutique hotels, then I highly suggest this hotel.  From the moment you arrive, you feel like you're the only guest at the hotel.  The service is amazing!  I miss my fresh cup of delicious coffee that I received as I entered the lobby each morning.  The staff is better than amazing!  The rooms aren't large but they're well appointed and very comfortable.  The bed and bedding is as good as it gets.  The rooftop bar and small pool are a nice added touch, especially after a long day of sightseeing.  The location is perfect for those that want to explore the El Born, Gothic Quarter and waterfront neighborhoods.  The hotel has a nice restaurant for when you simply feel like taking it easy and not going anywhere.  FYI, we spent one evening during our trip at a 5-star hotel in Venice, Italy.  After one night at this ""5-Star hotel"", we couldn't wait to get back to The Hotel Serras.  In my humble opinion, The Hotel Serras is a 6-Star hotel property.  This hotel is all about hospitality.",5,2018,02,26
18,Unforgettable Memories,"A very delicate and lovely boutique hotel that offers all the amenities for a great experience. Excellent food, close to all attractions in Barcelona and very kind, friendly and willing to help staff. ",5,2018,02,25
18,"Tremendous service, excellent locaton","This is cute little boutique hotel right across from the marina.  The rooms are very nice, great shower and most have a small balcony as well.  The staff is very kind and ready to meet all of your needs at the drop of a hat.  The restaurant was very nice although we only ate breakfast there one time, it does have a Michelin star.  The cappuccino is the best I have ever had and my wife loved the Latte's.  The housekeeping was flawless with twice a day service and nice little treats at night time to come back to.  A great stay that I would absolutely repeat. My only complaint is that the lobby and lounge areas are boiling hot, it felt like at least 80F, I had to avoid these areas, I guess the Catalonian's like it hot.",5,2018,02,23
18,Will come back again,"Friendly staff, good service, perfect location! Best breakfasts ever: fruits, champagne, wide range of dishes! The rooftop is very romantic and fashion place. In summer time you can swim in the pool and get sunburnt.",5,2018,02,23
18,Luxury in Barcelona,"Our stay at The Serras exceeded any expectations that we had prior to our trip to Spain. After two wonderful but extremely hectic days in Madrid we returned to Barcelona for our last night in Spain before heading back to the US. While in Madrid, the staff at The Serras called twice to see if there was anything special we needed for our stay. This was only for a one night stay! Our room was not ready when we arrived at the hotel which was not a problem. But after returning we were informed that our rooms had been upgraded. So nice and so unexpected. The rooftop bar was incredible, even if the weather was cool. The bartender seemed excited to take our photos overlooking the harbor. Enough said....",5,2018,02,21
18,Sublime in every way,"An absolutely stunning hotel with the most generous and accommodating staff . I booked The Serras to stay in for a proposal to my now fiance. From the moment we walked into the hotel we were warmly received and offered complimentary cava (which was delicious).

The room was simply sublime and exceeded our expectations; comfortable, stylish and luxurious. We both felt extremely lucky to have such a beautiful room. The jacuzzi bath is a wonderful place to relax after a long day exploring! 

I would like to thank the staff for making our stay extra special; a magical hotel to celebrate our engagement, and certainly deserving of its reputation. 

We will be sure return in the future! 

Adele and Katie ",5,2018,02,21
18,Excellent!,"Great staff, beautiful hotel and in a great area of Barcelona. The staff was amazing and friendly. The restaurant was fantastic - we had dinner and breakfast there and both meals were interesting and yummy. Definitely go back there the next time I am in Barcelona.",5,2018,02,20
18,Perfect choice in Barcelona,"The staff is wonderful here at the Serras and really go above and beyond to make you comfortable. Jan and Daniel took such good care of us. 

The room was very comfortable, clean and well appointed. We looked forward to our turn down service each night with a delicious sweet waiting for us. We had a nice big windows which opened onto a terrace with pretty views.

The location is very nice in El Born which has some of the best restaurants and boutiques. And although we liked the Passeig De Gracia with its high end shopping, we preferred El Born which was more funky and casual in its vibe. It's also across the park from the Aquarium and Maremagnum. It was very centrally located to most attractions we went to.

The restaurant Informal is very good and if you go you must try the gnocchi.

My only negative goes for the pillows which are a little flat.",5,2018,02,19
18,Amazing Hotel & Great Birthday trip,"We stayed at this Hotel for my 50th Birthday. I could not fault the hotel on anything. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left it was amazing. Lovely friendly staff & fabulous room. Loved the turn down service! 
The complimentary champagne & cake when we arrived was a super touch, thank you.
Will definitely stay here again when we next visit Barcelona. The hotel is also in a fabulous location with lots of lovely tapas bars on the doorstep.
Thank you Hotel The Serras for a truly memorable birthday !",5,2018,02,19
18,5 Star staff making our stay memorable!,"The moment you walk in to The Serra’s you feel at home. The cleanliness, and decor of the hotel was fabulous. The staff was so in tune with our needs, as we were traveling with 6 adults, and 4 kids. They were helping us left and right with strollers, bags, jackets, whatever it was that we needed they were there for us, and it truly meant so much to us! Our room was great! It was so prestine and comfortable. The location of the hotel is in a great spot! Everything you need is nearby, and you are a short walking distance from the ocean. Sandra, one of the restaurant managers was so endearing, and incredibly sweet with the children in our family. She made every dining experience so special for us that our time went so smoothly while eating meals in the restaurant. The day we left (which was 6 AM) Sandra arranged to have cappuccinos made up for the adults, and pastries for the kids brought out to us while we were waiting for our taxis to take us to the airport ❤️ I can’t stop boasting to people I know about how amazing our stay at The Serra’s was. We will definitely make a return back to this outstanding hotel!",5,2018,02,18
18,Amazing stay,Fabulous hotel. Daniel was especially helpful - giving us great recommendations for dinner and things to do. Gorgeous interiors and a stunning rooftop bar overlooking port and city. Near to the old town which in my opinion is the best part of Barcelona. Really happy and loved our stay! Thank you!,5,2018,02,16
18,"Beautiful hotel, impeccable service","This hotel is well located - easy walking distance to everything without being right in the middle of a noisy, heavily trafficked area. Great view of the harbor. All the right amenities - rooftop bar with small pool, fireplace, seating areas. Complimentary glasses of cava, turn down service with water bottles, small snacks, etc. What stands out more than anything though is the service. The staff went out of their way to make sure every need was met, no matter how tiny -- even sending emails to check in regarding our needs prior to our arrival. The entire experience was amazing from start to finish. I'm still dreaming of the cava (wish I could find it here in the States!) and can't wait to return!",5,2018,02,12
18,Quick and lovely.,"It was a short stay, just 20 hours on a layover in Barcelona, but the staff at the hotel made us feel at home. They were kind enough to give us an upgrade to a lovely suite and their warm hospitality went a long way to make us forget the cold wet weather outside. We look forward to staying longer next time we're back in Barcelona.",5,2018,02,10
18,Amazing Hotel,"This hotel is amazing. I'm pretty picky about my hotels,and this one absolutely blew me away. The hotel is pretty small but it is VERY clean and the entire staff was amazing. The hotel is right across from the marina and there are several bars and restaurants within walking distance. I'd love to coma back to Barcelona in the spring/summer when the weather is warm to take advantage of the great rooftop bar and views. I'd definitely stay here again in a heartbeat and I highly recommend. It's 5 star service all the way!!",5,2018,02,06
18,New Year's Bliss,"We traveled as a party of 4, my husband, myself and 2 clients.  We booked 2 junior suites with the sea (port) view. Please note the rooms are across the street from the port but this does not take away from their beauty! The rooms were 10/10!  Freestanding tub to die for! Plentiful lighting, gorgeous design, turn-down service daily and an impeccable breakfast (included with the suite) each morning at the hotel restaurant, Informal. The front desk was extremely helpful in locating city locations and reviewed the city map with us several times as requested. The gym is small but would do the trick- I never even ended up using it (and I am a runner who chose this hotel partially on the fact it has a gym) since we were walking so much! My husband and I ran outside one morning down around the port and back and it was lovely! The front door was always opened for us upon entering the hotel.  The fact that Picasso's first studio once stood within the hotel's walls (take note, it is completely new inside) is in itself remarkable! The location is optimal; walk outside and you literally are in the cobblestone roads of the Gothic Quarter. Just a few blocks away are tons of restaurants and shops. Across the street is the mall and the port. We also felt extremely safe here!  The best of all worlds here! I do recommend going on New Year's, as our NYE dinner at the Informal was perfection. This hotel was also only minutes from the airport. It's no wonder it's won awards! Will be back!",5,2018,02,06
18,The Best,"We are a 60 ish year old couple who have stayed in many hotels and accommodations and The Serras ranks at the top. Small, beautiful, elegant, modern, incredibly well designed, facing the water with a lovely rooftop terrace. The rooms are sound proof with air conditioning and heating that you cannot hear at all, an elegant bathroom, and very comfortable bed . The staff are gracious, helpful, and totally committed to your welfare and needs. If you can spring it, go!",5,2018,02,04
18,"Amazing stay, wish it could have lasted a little longer...","We have just returned from 2 nights at The Serras, which can only be described as a perfect boutique hotel, in an awesome location, with superb customer service and attention to detail.  Highly recommend and will be visiting again for sure.  
Thank you! ",5,2018,02,03
18,Amazing!,"We stayed at the Serras 1/19-25. From the moment we entered through the front door we were at home. This is a small boutique hotel located perfectly in the center of the city to get to all the places you might want to see. The entire staff works together to make your stay the best it can be. There are always two greeters immediately in the lobby to open the door, welcome you and answer any questions you might have. The dining room is located right off the lobby and the waitstaff is part of the welcome. They want to make sure you have everything you need. The entire staff is truly sincere in their efforts to make your trip the best it can be. The rooms are lovely, the food is wonderful, the shower is heavenly and they have an amazing rooftop lounge that is both cozy and spectacular. When we return, we will certainly stay here again. Thank you Sergio and Andrea, the dining room staff and everyone else for making our stay so comfortable and memorable. ",5,2018,02,03
18,Wonderful Barcelona get-away,"My wife and I visited Barcelona for a long weekend for the 1st time and had the good fortune to stay at the Serras. Location is outstanding, service is friendly, attentive and informative, rooms very nice with spacious bathrooms. Restaurant/bar is cozy with lots of good choices. Barcelona is great and The Serras made our trip as good as it could be.",5,2018,01,31
18,Fabulous weekend. Wonderful hotel.,"The Serras Hotel was an excellent choice for our weekend in Barcelona. The welcome was warm and consistent through out our stay. Welcomed with Champagne,( and the glass was topped up! )We were given a comprehensive guide to the sights of Barcelona, and good advice on what to see.  The room was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was well stocked including bathrobes and slippers. The linen was very good quality. The breakfast was the best I've had anywhere. Freshly cooked in view, if that's your choice, beautifully fresh fruit bowels, pastries, fresh juice, tea/ coffee etc.  (Yes there was champagne too!) All the staff were genuinely friendly, it's in an excellent position for Las Ramblas, and I would recommend a stay here in a heartbeat.",5,2018,01,29
18,Feeling special at a boutique hotel,"My wife and I arrived tired from a cross Atlantic flight and Maria at reception would not rest until she eased us into a room. Sergio, the concierge, continued to look for more ways to make our trip even more enjoyable. Diego at the fantastic restaurant catered to our dietary needs and ensured the right beverage was waiting for us as we entered the front door.",5,2018,01,28
18,The Serras,"It was a fantastic time we spent at the Serras.    They always tried to make is feel like home, the quality of the food and beverages is excellent.   The location of the hotel is ideal for safe walking at any time.  ",5,2018,01,24
18,Thank you the Serras :),"Everything was perfect. We loved the room, the breakfast, the people who works in...We had a wonderful stay in this hotel. I don't know what to add except it's the best hotel we tried in Barcelona.
See you soon!",5,2018,01,24
18,Sorprenent! Amazing hotel......,"Thank you to Diego and all the team! You made our stay very welcome each morning and night....simply beautiful. Will definitely return to our Barcelona “home” on our next visit.

Thank you!

Markus, Marika, Curtis and Gabe Preston ",5,2018,01,24
18,Fantastic hotel - made Barcelona visit perfect,"This hotel is superior in almost every way. The staff go above and beyond the call of duty. They couldn’t be more helpful.  The restaurant is superb. After some mediocre offerings elsewhere, we dined almost every day here.  The food is fresh and light and the fish is so fresh it’s almost alive!  
Couldn’t recommend this hotel more.
We will definitely return.",5,2018,01,23
18,Wonderful luxurious stay with helpful staff,"We were here for 3 nights on our honeymoon and the hotel and staff did not disappoint. The room was elegant with a great shower and bed. The view from the room was mediocre as it faced the adjoining building but that was made up for with the gorgeous rooftop terrace and the view of the harbour. The staff, particularly Daniel and the intern whose name we've forgotten, were very helpful with providing restaurant suggestions and activities. The hotel is walkable to many highlights and the metro as well. Had a wonderful time and would highly recommend! ",5,2018,01,22
18,trip to barcelona,"the hotel is great  because of the location, rooms, staff, breakfast (best hollandaise sauce i ever had), valet parking etc .  i would strongly recommend to other travelers. unfortunately we stayed only one night  ",5,2018,01,16
18,Wonderful boutique hotel on the waterfront,"The hotel is right on the waterfront in the Gothic Quarter and super close to the Born and Ramblas!  We walked everywhere.  The front desk staff were fantastic and helpful and even made dinner reservations for us!  The bed was confortable and the shower fantastic!  Also, had dinner one night at the hotel restaurant which was delicious.  I highly recommend staying at The Serras!",5,2018,01,16
18,Very good hotel,"I can recomand this Hotel and will come back soon. Staff is very friendly, the rooms and Restaurants very clean. The Food at the Restaurant Informal was excellent! The rooms are large and comfortable.",5,2018,01,16
18,Nicest boutique-style city hotel I have been too and perfect location for exploring the beautiful city of Barcelona .,"From the moment when you arrive at this lovely hotel when the friendly staff offer you a glass of a Cava, and help arrange bookings for Barcelona attractions, to when you leave you are made to feel special. The hotel is in a fantastic location within easy walking distance of all the central sights and shopping , overlooking the yacht marina  and yet bordering on the gothic quarter with all the lovely buildings, alleyways , bars and restaurants. It is a 20 minute taxi journey from the airport.  The hotel is small ( only 26 rooms), very stylish, and extremely well appointed . There is a small gym and roof top plunge pool ( a bit cold for that in January!). We had room 407 overlooking the tiny street at the back with quaint views. The room was a junior suite and very well laid out. It was also very quiet . A few little tapas and a bottle of Cava on ice had been left out for us which we enjoyed as our pre dinner drinks on the roof top terrace sitting by a gas fire,which was magical. Dinner and breakfast were delicious and the dinner was excellent value for money, with a well priced wine list. We plan to return to this gem of a hotel .",5,2018,01,15
18,"Excellent service, great location","We spent 5 nights at The Serras. The staff was fantastic, friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable (I hate squooshy hotel beds and this one was moderately firm), and the roof deck is fabulous. The decor and design is simple and elegant. Classy place.",5,2018,01,08
18,Excellent,"Very nice place.

Good vibes.

Warm welcome & staff.

Perfect location.

Wonderful room.

In winter the rooftop is not very busy but still open and provide a nice moment.

Did not have enough time to try the restaurant but will definitely come back !",5,2018,01,04
18,A Fabulous Greeting ,"The immediate, and lasting, impression of Serras was the greeting upon arrival. Very friendly, very warm and most helpful. Champagne served during check-in process was greatly appreciated. The Serras is modern, the rooms spacious and impeccably presented. The location is excellent - close to marina, restaurants and shopping. 15mins cab ride to train station. The Serras’ menu was adequate for the whole family. The food was excellent. It is always a pleasure to stay in places where the staff is genuinely happy, polite and attentive. The Serras is one of those (unfortunately rare) places.",5,2018,01,03
18,New Years in Barcelona ,"Family of four adults in Barcelona for New Years, this quaint hotel shines from the moment you step on the curb! Customer service is second to none, the property if first class (clean, comfortable, amenities, food) and it’s located in a safe and walkable area.
On site restaurant, excellent service, food, and wine selection.

",5,2018,01,03
18,Impeccable return - Pure Pleasure!,"Once again, a remarkable experience at The Serras! Starting with the high touch email exchange and attention to every detail. It's as if the staff wears binoculars! As our taxi approaches the always engaging staff runs to greet you curbside, whisks you inside for a chilled bottle of Cava and beverage for our son at check-in. Major shout out to Diego and the Serras team for continuing to raise the bar with their service model. Our nine year old son couldn't wait to get to our room and receive his personalized gift. Last time this was a Serras branded hippo stuffie (in tow) and this visit he loved the FCB soccer ball. We were also treated to a chilled bottle of Cava with delicious chocolates. The 29 room hotel is beautiful with double pane French door windows opening up to two terraces. Housekeeping perfection - including a variety of hand made sweets at turndown. Rooftop terrace, bar and pool overlook Port Vell and as well provide impeccable service! This was our second leg of a 16 day trip, coming from London and it felt more like coming home. Family travel to The Serras is a must! Restaurante Informal is inspired and executes at a high level - we thoroughly enjoyed our fixed Christmas Eve dinner while accommodating our sons tastes. I struggle to find anything to improve upon. We can't wait to return to beautiful Barcelona where you will find us once again at The Serras. Perfecto!!! 
",5,2018,01,01
18,Amazing boutique hotel,"We stayed at the Serras for 3 nights during our week long trip to Barcelona. I wanted to stay in two different areas of the city but I quickly wished we stayed the whole time at the Serras after checking out! 

The hotel is small and beautiful in a great location right on the edge of the gothic/water front. The best part of the hotel is the staff. Every single person we spoke to at the hotel went out of their way to help us have an amazing trip. The staff all spoke amazing English, were friendly all the time and made our trip that much more enjoyable with their tips about the city. 

We stayed in a standard room, it wasn't huge but it's laid out nicely and the bathroom is huge for Europe. Great rain shower, nice bathroom amenities and separate toilet area. 

The hotel also gives you a smart phone with data/wifi/calling for your stay to take out of the hotel which is clutch when you're trying to find your way through the gothic! 

We pent a night on the roof having drinks next to the fire and loved it. I booked the Serras based off tripadvisor reviews and am happy to leave them another 5 star, amazing hotel and staff (probably the nicest and most helpful hotel staff I've ever seen).",5,2017,12,29
18,fabulous in every way,"The hotel is very new, clean and very well located.  Rooms are a touch on the small size but we were upgraded to one of the grand deluxe which was just right for a few days (the smaller size would probably be hard for a couple to access suitcases easily).  The room was very well appointed with a very comfortable bed, and great little balcony overlooking the marina.  

Breakfast was included in our booking and the standard of the meal has been unequalled in our travels through Spain since! the buffet area whilst small consisted of amazing quality produce.  the hot options were Michelin Star food!  perhaps not what a traveller wants every day, but every now and then it was amazing.  We also ate at the restaurant for lunch, and whilst not as cheap as most Barcelona places, the quality was fantastic.

The stand out for the Senna over the room and food, is without doubt the staff, including manager.  They gave a personal touch and actually made the extra effort to make sure guests were always happy.

We will definitely return to the Serras next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2017,12,20
18,"Great location, great rooftop bar but expensive","First the great - the location is excellent. The hotel itself is tastefully furnished. And the rooftop bar is quite nice - both the decor as well as the view. And for those who like small/intimate hotels, the Serras is for you.

We ended up getting one of their junior suites. The total square footage was about the same as a large double room but the configuration as a suite made it feel a little cramped.

Overall, there was nothing that we did not like about the hotel but I will note that it was expensive compared to other equivalent luxury hotel options in Barcelona. We had also stayed in the majestic which was not as intimate (being a larger hotel) but was equivalent service, room size at about half the price imo.",4,2017,12,15
18,This boutique hotel should be on your Barcelona shortlist,"We stayed for four nights in late November and were surprised to find a perfect pre-Christmas hideaway on the Mediterranean. The facade and lobby were beautifully decorated, lifting the spirits whenever we returned after dark. The young and uber-friendly staff left an equally lasting impression. We were offered champagne during check in and also found a chilled bottle when we entered our room. The room itself was a larger category, with an excellent minibar and coffee making facilities, and a huge bath with double vanity and rainfall shower. The only slight letdown was the lack of sunlight; like most of the rooms ours looked out over a charming but narrow alley and despite being on the fourth floor there isn’t much of a water view from the balcony.
The restaurant is excellent for both breakfast and dinner. I don’t think it is open for room service though (not entirely sure). There is also a tiny gym; essentially one treadmill and one elliptical trainer plus some minimalistic equipment. The Life Fitness treadmill is modern and in excellent condition, just hope you’ll be the only one wanting to use it. You actually might be, given that a decent running route can be had from the Serras - down to the W hotel and up the beach promenade from there.
The location is almost unbeatable, the Picasso museum is an easy 10-15 mins walk and even the Miró foundation is a reasonable hike away. Bars and restaurants abound pretty much in any direction you choose from there. ",5,2017,12,14
18,Perfect. Don't look at any other hotel.,"Stayed for 4 days in July with my teenage son. Perfect in every way. Roof top terrace is wonderful any time of day. Great location. Staff very friendly and helpful. I had a minor problem with wifi and staff went out of their way to resolve.
Restaurant is amazing. My 15 year old wanted to go back for a second time. Brilliant kitchen team. Lots of thought goes into breakfast as well. Well done Hotel The Serras. One of my top 5 hotels in world.",5,2017,12,02
18,Excellent Location,Totally agree with all of the positive reviews on this hotel.  We stayed for a few days and the location proved to be within walking distance of everything.  The people watching from the balcony was great :)  Service and accommodations were top notch.  Highly recommend a visit to The Serras  Hope to be back some day :),5,2017,12,01
18,Exceptional,The hotel was amazing I never thought i would of experienced something quite like my trip to Spain.The Staff where very nice and helpful and recommended multiple local locations to visit that did not cost me and my friends to much money to do. The nights out where great as well we visited many nearby clubs and the locals really do know how to have a good time and the hotel make a great breakfast!,5,2017,11,29
18,A superb experience,"Hello again Antonio, we just finished our trip and felt the need to tell you again that....we will be back. Not because your hotel is superb in so many ways--you already know that, many others i""m sure have told you so. but rather because of the warmth, the friendliness the happiness of all your employees that we met--and we met a lot. It is contagious and calming especially for strangers in a foreign land who are made to feel genuinely welcome. I believe this perception of being safe and at home develops from a culture started and or demonstrated by you or other senior staff. Please say hello for us to Daniela, Alexia,Anastasia,Victoria,Sandra Messi, Jennifer and others whose names I can't now recall, but still want to say hi to. What a multi cultural group from countries around the globe--and all infused with a smile and a hello. Until the next time, Joan and Jerry ...........and feel free to pass this note on to whom ever you may choose",5,2017,11,28
18,My new home...,"This was our first stay at The Serras and certainly not the last! 
The hotel location is excellent, in the Gothic quarter and overlooking the marina, 10 minutes walk from La Rambla and just over 30 minutes walk from la Sagrada Familia (or 15 min by cab if you're not a keen walker!).
We were greeted by such a lovely reception team, knowledgeable, at ease and so pleasant to chat to, in fact, every one we dealt with at the hotel was great, just the right attitude, friendly yet super pro.
We stayed in a Junior Suite which was spacious and just beautiful; we had a small 'balcony' (not one that's big enough to fit a table but you can step out a little to enjoy the views) and the double windows meant we didn't hear much of the noise. Beds are mega comfortable and appointed with the softest linen too. There's a comfortable seating area too. The bathroom is gorgeous, with both a walk-in shower (complete with giant shower head and aromatherapy pods diffusing essential oils) and a jacuzzi bath - not sure how we managed to leave the room with all the temptations of staying in! There's a mobile phone for you to use for local calls and it also has 4G so you can browse at leisure and also navigate on Google map. It's loaded with useful info and promos too.
We had dinner at Informal, the hotel's main restaurant, run by Michelin-starred Chef Marc Gascons - it was delicious from start to finish; we had tuna belly and the dry rice with lobster and vegetables - so generously portioned and tasty! Desserts were stunning too, I highly recommend the torrija (or pain perdu) with coffee, cream and salted caramel ice cream. Need I say more?
Finally - the terrace, cleverly 'split' so there's a dedicated section for hotel guests (around the pool). We had pre-dinner drinks there and the views over the marina are incredible.",5,2017,11,27
18,Beyond Excellence,"If there were such a thing as a 7 star hotel rating, Hotel The Serras would qualify.  Online reservations was easy to navigate, follow up included a phone call the week before from Barcelona asking if questions or needs.  Hotel arranged car pick up service (additional fee, but so worth it) was on time pleasant experience; check in staff excellent and after dealings with staff; hotel recently renovated having large rooms-especially the bathroom; beautiful modern sophisticated decor; we reserved average room but it had a balcony where we could see the ocean in the distance; dinner at their restaurant was one of top 5 in my life; waiters very professional but personal; wonderful food and drink surprises in room after dinner; roof top bar and pool, such a beautiful view; totally felt pampered; excellent location near harbor, cruise ships, and museums.  Thank you staff of Hotel The Serras for making the start of our vacation so memorable.",5,2017,11,23
18,Relentless in he pursuit of perfection,"The staff diligently addressed any issue , Each and every day staff would seek us out to ensure that our accommodations were stellar and without question...commitment to excellence was not only noticed...but his hyper-care treatment of his guests was deeply appreciated! Iv had very poor expierneced with hotels recently that I’ll be staying at , just in the prepare of simply booking a dinner reservation before hand as if they couldn’t this hotel on the other hand is 5 Star ,

These high-end resorts require a dedicated team who are relentless in the pursuit of perfection and luxury. We were fortunate to meet the staff and enjoy there personable nature ,excellent group of hospitality , I highly recommend booking groups here 

For the property...so many notable features. Roof top bar ,pool , incredible trained staff ,WICH makes or breaks a hotel",5,2017,11,22
18,True Luxury,"I typically don't write reviews on the first night, but the service was so exceptional, I did not want to wait.  My partner and I stayed here pre-cruise and were blown away by the attentiveness of the staff, the little extras that make this a boutique experience, the room and the location.  If I returned to Barcelona, I would stay here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend!  ",5,2017,11,22
18,Beautiful Barcelona is even Better at the The Serras,"We spent the last 5 nights in a Suite at the Serras Hotel.  It was an incredible experience.  The decor is boutique modern - really well set up rooms that are spacious for an extended stay or a night in, overlooking the water.  It is possibly the best location in Barcelona.  We walked to every major site and shopping experience.  Be sure to spend an afternoon and maybe an evening at the rooftop lounge.  Great atmosphere with an experienced mixologist.  We had breakfast included in our rate, which we highly recommend as the food was local, fresh and delicious but the service was even better.  Sandra was fantastic - we had a great chat about our plans each day.   The entire team made us feel welcome - and knew us by name.  It was as if we were being welcomed home every afternoon and evening upon return.   We will be back!  100% certain of that!.",5,2017,11,22
18,Outstanding ,"Everything about my stay was excellent. The staff are attentive, helpful and subtle. The attached restaurant is fantastic. The location is convenient and beautiful. All in all an ideal place to stay. I would recommend getting up early and walking the marina/beach opposite the hotel.",5,2017,11,18
18,Hotel with one of the best restaurants in Barcelona,"It was a wonderful experience! We went the the rooftop bar, it was raining, but the rooftop was covered and there was a special and cozy atmosphere there... Then we had a dinner at the restaurant and the food was really excellent: probably the best patatas bravas in town, super fresh grilled mushrooms, and the meat was one of the best I have ever eaten (I took chateaubriand and my husband ate Rib Eye steak, both were amazing!).
Good wine, excellent service and warm atmosphere... Everything was just perfect! I would like to thank the hotel and restaurant staff for such a great evening! Definitely we'll come back!",5,2017,11,12
18,"Very good hotel , very friendly staff",Very good hotel well located for gothic quarter and el born and even a stroll along the beach. Staff were incredible. Rooms are moderately sized but well planned and well decorated. Quiet and comfy stay. ,4,2017,11,11
18,Gold Standard Service,"Every hotel on the planet should send its staff to this venue for them to learn what great customer service is actually like (and how they should deliver it). The service we received was just exemplary. Everything else is great also... location, wifi, bar, pool restaurant (awesome food), cleanliness and room appointments. It really is that good! The boutique size of the hotel no doubts help them deliver such exceptional service and we hope it stays that way!",5,2017,11,10
18,Impeccable Service,"We felt “Luxury Boutique Hotel” perfectly describes this hotel with Impeccable service.
A very warm and very friendly reception upon our arrival.  The bell man (Sergio) promptly retrieved our luggage from the taxi.  Check in was very polite, quick and easy.  They offered a warm towel for our hands as we waited to check in.  We arrived early (from a cruise roughly one mile from port to hotel) so our room wasn’t quite ready.  After sitting in the lobby for a short while. “Diego” stopped by to offer coffee and said they were working to get our room ready.  We were soon escorted to our room which they generously had upgraded to a junior suite.  The room was beautiful!  We found their free WiFi to be very fast.  Also their air conditioning system is “silent”  which was wonderful!  We later went up to the rooftop for a drink, what a view!  Sadly we were only staying one night.  A truly enjoyable experience.  Thank You Serras!
",5,2017,11,06
18,Fabulous,"We stopped for a drink on the roof top bar and we're delighted with our welcome.  The elderberry champagne cocktails were excellent, views lovely and service charming.  Next time we want to stay at the hotel too.",5,2017,11,04
18,Exceptional Hotel.,"Our room was Grand deluxe double room which was spacious and beautifully decorated. The bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel was just perfect, overlooking the sea and old town just behind the hotel where you have loads of nice restaurants and cafes. The breakfast was high quality, with hot dishes served freshly cooked upon your request. The hotel staff were very friendly as they would accommodate your wishes to the best they can. The roof top terrace is lovely with gorgeous views. The hotel would provide free water bottles everyday. I would definitely stay in The Serras in the future.",5,2017,11,03
18,We will go back,"Great location in city center with a perfect view. We find the place nice with a  fresh smell and clean. A lot of nice restaurants around with reasonable price. Breakfast is great, top class service by staff",5,2017,11,03
18,"The Serras Hotel, Barcelona",the roof terrace with fine views over the harbour area is a wonderful place to relax after sightseeing in this fascinating town with so much to see and such cultural depth; characterised by the quirky architecture of Gaudi ;the priceless art of Picasso and the dleicious Catalonian fish and other food and wine.,5,2017,11,02
18,Short trip in great city,"excellent hotel in ideal location staff fantastic and very helpful ,rooms quiet with top class facilities ,breakfast food great ,great views of the city from roof top bar ,marina and port area within walking distance as is la rambis and all major designer shops 
 

 

",5,2017,11,01
18,A perfect stay,"The Hotel has a great location, walking distance to the Gotic old town area & the waterfront. The hotel staff are exceptional they strive to make the stay first class. We found our room a Grand Deluxe to be very spacious by European standards. The bed was very comfortable & had rounded corners so no problems with bruising one's shins! The bathroom was spacious & the room was always immaculate.  We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,10,30
18,Very friendly staff ,"The hotel is rated 5 Star, I felt that it is over rated, staff are very friendly and helpful, however the housekeeping did not clean the room till 4:30 PM, the rate was too high for what I got, location is good but they only have a couple of rooms with sea and marina view ",3,2017,10,29
18,Great time ,"We stayed for 3 nights in this beautiful hotel with standing design in large rooms with all things that's could make your stay juste perfect
Gartitud for staff for they kind in hephfull to as certainly I well back ",5,2017,10,28
18,Beautiful Barcelona!,Stunning views with impeccable service and style! This beautiful hotel made our first trip to Barcelona absolutely magical. The view from our second floor room was simply perfect to wake up to. Thank you to all the staff for their faultless service and warm hospitality.  We will definitely be returning! ,5,2017,10,25
18,"Views, luxurious interior....and Thunderbirds TV","We stayed here for 3 days after a weekend in Madrid and a 2.5 hour train journey. Why we can't have high speed trains like the AVE in the Uk I will never understand. Whay are we so averse to high speed and high efficiency.....but that's another story.

We like Barcelona - a lot. This was our 3rd trip in the last 12 months and we like food, drink and atmosphere so location is very important. The Serras is fabulously located, on the edge of the Gothic quarter, with vistas over the Marina to Barcelonetta. I must have walked past the Serras a dozen times without noticing it. It is next to some fairly unremarkable offices / apartments and restaurants and is very understated. 

The foyer is very cool and contemporary. Check in is attentive ad friendly....with a glass of chilled Cava. We were given a quick tour of the mezzanine and the roof terrace and shown to our junior suite on the 2nd floor on the front elevation.

The roof was delightful and bright with 2 sets of french windows and a balcony, a huge en-suite with massive shower and a TV that emerged from a bed end unit in a 'Thinderbirds style'. I swear that every time the TV was called into action we hummed the theme tune. The room was well equipped - lots of storage (we only had 5 days worth of clothes), an espresso maker and one of those fab BOSE speakers that are now cropping up in boutique hotels - nice to open the cava and the windows and sit listening to some chilled tunes.

The roof top bar is really nice with fabulous views across the marina. We spent a few hours lounging, drinking and nibbling. We didnt eat at the hotel, but we were told by other guests that the food was fantastic.

Any down sides? The road in front of the hotel is 4/6 lanes wide and there can be traffic noise even with the windows shut and the roof top bar gets traffic noise all day - but you are in a city after all. The hotel has 28 rooms which is quite large to still call itself 'boutique' so it was just the right side of not feeling corporate. We had a slight problem with the reservation which was cleared up quickly and professionally.

We'd happily come back....if only for the Thunderbirds TV!",5,2017,10,25
18,very expensive,Very expensive. Good experience and lovely rooms but expected a little more based on price and other reviews.  Very friendly staff however expected airport transfer for the price which wasn't included. Room was quite small and wasn't anything that special about it for the price to be honest or any special touches apart from bottle of bubbles and some snacks on arrival. Breakfast was very expensive. Bathrooms were lovely and large however the fan didn't work. ,4,2017,10,24
18,A Must Memoriable Luxury Stay in Barcelona,"I travelled to Barcelona with my parents at the end of our cruise. I only stayed one night and my parents stayed 4. Even just one night I'm very confident to say this hotel is a must stay in barcelona. I will definitely come back and recommend to my friends. It's a beautiful, comfortable, thoughtful, luxury boutique hotel. 

The hotel is small but providing everything you can name it a "" high end satisfied enjoyable hotel"". Very nice and warm staff to welcome us and help us to do early checkin around 9am. Regular checkin time is around 2pm but our room were ready before noon. Check in was quick, easy, very well explained, and even a glass of mimosa was provided.  Every staff in this hotel is friendly, nice, respectful, thoughtful, smiling and welcoming. Every staff speaks very good english. Breakfast is super tasty, with a variety of choices and beautiful presentation. We stayed in grand deluxe room and junior suite with sea view. They are both super good. To our suprise these 2 rooms we stayed (501 and 502) are kind of a private suite. There is a door to separate these 2 rooms from other rooms on that floor, which is super convenient for a family. We feel like we have our own suite.This arrangement was prepared by the staff before our arrival, which is very thoughtful. Room is spacious, clean, bright, high tech (yes, they even offer a phone for free international calls). View is gorgours. Wifi is super. Bed is soooo comfortable. My mom enjoyed the bathtub a lot and the balcony is a bonus. We watched a concert at night and one staff (sorry I forgot the name) helped us to get a taxi, told the driver where we go, and even gave us a card from the hotel so on our way back we can show taxi driver the hotel address.

Last but not least, before arrival I emailed the hotel a lot of questions and made quite a few changes to my reservation, the staff always responded quickly and friendly, and they assisted me with every single question and satisfied answers. Thanks everyone in the hotel! A good hotel is very hard to find to satisfy every aspect of a guest's need but hotel serras is the one kind good hotel.",5,2017,10,19
18,Beautiful Hotel - AMAZING Staff,"We stayed at the The Serras in August 2017 and absolutely loved it.  The hotel is in a great location, walk to the beach and the entire old city, but also very accessible by taxi if needed.  The hotel is as the photos show, beautiful.  We had two beautiful rooms overlooking the road and they were very very quiet which was important since we were with our kids.  The food in the restaurant was excellent and very accommodating for my daughter's celiac (gluten-free).  In fact, the complimentary turn down treats were all GF just for her.  The pool was really refreshing after a hot day touring around the city.  

Most of all the staff was truly amazing!  Every last one of them could not have been more accommodating and more genuine in their hospitality.  No detail was left undone.  We went to Mallorca and came back to The Serras for one last night before flying back to the US but I felt as though I was already home arriving back in Barcelona.  The familiar faces all ready to have us back.  You were all amazing, thank you!",5,2017,10,17
18,Believe the hype,"So I've got to be honest - I read the reviews, and was excited to stay at the hotel, but thought it might not have delivered on the hype.  It did.  From the moment we got there to the moment we left, our trip was brilliant.  The Serras take ""personalized service"" to the next level.  They helped us with everything - dinner reservations, bar recommendations, advice on the best beach etc.  Not to mention the cava in abundance in the lobby!  The hotel itself is gorgeous - beautifully designed, and the bedroom we stayed in (501) was amazing - front facing junior suite, and honestly don't think there could be a better room in the hotel.  As others say, the bed was amazing.  I'm pretty hard to please, and can honestly say this hotel was faultless.  Special shout out to Andrea and Maria on reception who couldn't have done more for us. Location also spot on, nicely sandwiched between the gothic quarter and el borne.  The rooftop amazing for sunset and drinks.  Any more complimentary adjectives left? Can you tell we liked this hotel?",5,2017,10,14
18,What a treat,"My husband booked this hotel for four nights and it was just perfect. From the moment we arrived until the day we left the service was 11/10. Every staff member that we interacted with was excellent, friendly and very professional. Check-in was very special, hot flannel to refresh and a glass of sparkling wine. We have never had this type of check-in before and we have stayed in many hotels in different cities in the world. 
We were given a tour of the hotel and the decor is gorgeous, I took photos of things that I would like to replicate when we build a new house. The rooftop area is a lovely bonus, although the pool was very cold but the air temperature hot. The view out to the marina area is beautiful. The rooftop bar we used every night and had cocktails beside the pool during the day, a refreshing one is the iceblock in the sparkling wine, yummy. On arrival to our room was a small platter with some sweet treats on it and a bottle of sparkling wine in an ice bucket. Each night there was a turn down service where a little sweet treat was left beside the bed.
We dined in the formal restaurant the first night and the Dinner was exceptional. We also had bar snacks one night in the library area which were also of high quality.
We didn't want to have to leave this lovely hotel and plan to return again one day when we get to that side of the world again, hopefully it remains as good as it is now.",5,2017,10,13

18,First Class Service,"This hotel truly deserves the glowing reviews they receive and its high status on trip advisor. If service and customer attention are important to you then you will not be disappointed staying at this hotel. The hotel is also fantastically located being in close walking proximity to many areas of Barcelona but away from the noise and busy touristy areas. 
We had two rooms for a week and really didn’t want to leave the hotel, if we are ever in Barcelona there is no question of where we would stay. The rooms are silent when the double doors are closed so you do not get bothered by any outside noise. 
Our teenage daughters loved the complimentary phone with internet access that could be used whilst in town and my wife and I loved the rooftop bar. 
The front of house, restaurant, concierge and bar staff are attentive, professional and truly do care. We had an evening that didn’t go as expected and I am not going to go into the detail of it but rather only mention it so that I can say that the way that the staff and Antonio responded to this occurrence was absolutely second to none. Things can go wrong and it is what happens after that which we remember. The staff at The Serras put customer experience and satisfaction first and whilst many companies claim they do, not many can deliver in this area. Well done Antonio and team!! We can’t wait to one day stay at The Serras again. ",5,2017,10,11
18,Sunset rooftop bar,This beautiful hotel has a stunning rooftop which is the best place in town to watch the sunset. Had some fantastic cocktails with friends and the service was impeccable. Had some small tapas food to go with the drinks which was also very good.,5,2017,10,06
18,Review about this hotel,In  last week august i visited hotel Serras. Theare many big large rooms in hotel. Very big  swimming pool with sea water. Big fitnes center in this hotel.  Very tasty food and vine i liked to eat in breafast.I want to travel Spain next year.,5,2017,10,06
18,Obession for quality ,"The hotel is located ideally opposite the old Marina and on the edge of the Gothic quarter.
The public spaces and suites are perfect. Coming g modern minimalist styles with mirrors and flowers. The staff are extremely attentive taking great care to ensure our visit will be most enjoyable.
Our breakfast today was memorable as one of the best for Avery long time",5,2017,10,05
18,First class hotel,"Luxury boutique hotel with rooftop pool and bar, gym, restaurant and beautifully appointed rooms.  This hotel was found on Trip Advisor, which I trust for all of my travel decisions.  It did not disappoint.  The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the rooms were clean and modern.  The turn down service was over the top!
Will definitely be back!",5,2017,10,04
18,The most wonderful experience,"We must leave tomorrow morning and wish we did not have to. The attention to service and detail began before we arrived, with an email asking if they could help in any way prior to arrival.  Every member of the staff went well out of their way to see that our stay was exceptional. Many 5 star hotels are formal and a bit intimidating.  The Serras is small and friendly, warm and welcoming, and they work hard to anticipate every need. The staff knew who you were and remembered things such as what after-dinner drink you had.  If you asked a question about restaurants or things to see, they spent lots of time with you making sure your visit was perfect.  The restaurant had the best food I have ever had at prices that were not over-inflated. The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are newly decorated, and there is amazing sound and light proofing, which can be a problem in city hotels.  Everything is spotless.  And every night, instead of the usual bit of chocolate on your pillow, they brought individual bottled water and treats such as meringues and eclairs! Barcelona is an incredible city, and The Serras is an incredible hotel!  ",5,2017,10,03
18,I love to stay there,"I love to stay in Hotel the Serras, you can feel there very relax and comfort. The hotel staff was very active and well behaved with the customer but the hotel is little expensive according to my budget :( otherwise, you can make the best memory with your partner in this hotel.",4,2017,10,03
18,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"I recommend this hotel if you are staying at this hotel. The staffs a(I forgot the names its been a while) are awesome/so helpful. Thank for making our holiday great. So memorable. We would definitely come again to this awesome place. 
The hotel offers comfy beds, room are quiet You just feels like there is most relaxing place.",5,2017,10,01
18,Fantastic Location and Hotel,"This exclusive and distinctive boutique hotel was a fantastic choice for a mini break with friends. Perfectly located across from the marina, steps from the Gothic Quarter and walking distance to the Metro La Rambla and beaches. The hotel design, attention to room detail, menu and food presentation was simply perfect.The terrace and pool area on the top floor offer not only magnificent views but a wonderful sun trap. The personal service throughout our 3 night stay was second to none, with any needs met. The staff greeted you as if you were apart on their family. We found a second home in Barcelona at this luxury hotel. We would return in a heartbeat. Thank you Antonio and all at Serras.",5,2017,09,29
18,Look no further for anywhere to stay in Barcelona!,"If you choose to stay at The Serras you are without a shadow of doubt choosing the very best for your stay in Barcelona. 
This was our second time here and we will return again and again, one of the most welcoming, personalised and beautiful experiences you can have from a hotel. The staff absolutely cannot do enough for you - that is everyone that you meet. Whether you are relaxing by the rooftop pool and would like something brought to you that comes from outside the hotel or whether you would like your food or drink prepared in a certain way - it really is their pleasure to make your stay the very best it can be.
With an exceptional location and a stunning interior, look no further for your trip to Barcelona. A true credit to you Antonio!",5,2017,09,28
18,Pay before you stay,"SUMMARY

On balance I recommend this hotel but they need to review their written payment policy ensuring that it reflects operational practice. It should be made clear to prospective patrons at the point of booking that FULL payment for the entirety of your stay is required up front on arrival. Clarity on this point will help potential patrons to make an informed decision about their preferred choice of hotel to avoid any misunderstandings.

***********************************

FULL REVIEW:

The Serras hotel is lovely. There were several nice touches. They call you in advance to check all arrangements are in place for your arrival. The staff are friendly and when you arrive, an usher approaches and takes your luggage from the taxi. The staff give you a warm welcome and present you with a hot flannel to wipe your hands and freshen up. You receive a welcome glass (or two!) of Cava. They then helpfully show you a map of the city and advise you of the key areas to visit.

Room 307 was lovely and quiet but rather compact for a twin room. The room had a high end Loewe TV and Bose radio/speaker. The hotel also provided a mobile phone in your room for you to take with you and use for free when out and about. It gave information on top attractions and had navigation apps so you could get around easily.

The external view outside the room window was not good and simply overlooked another visually unappealing building.

The roof top bar was compact but well appointed. 

We had a meal at the hotel in the evening of day one. It tasted really good given the chefs Michelin status however the portion size was derisory and therefore did not represent good value. We left the restaurant still feeling rather hungry and therefore chose not to have breakfasts at the hotel given this experience.

The hotel had a turn down service at night and they left a little sweet treat and a bottle of water each night which was appreciated. 

The biggest let down of this hotel was their breach of policy in respect of payment. The hotel was booked using Booking.com and having read the hotel policy I expected to pay for the 4 night stay at checkout.  From the moment of arrival, the hotel requested an up front payment in FULL for the entirety of the stay. 

It was very disappointing having read the policy and discussed it with hotel staff that they still persisted in requesting further payment despite the fact that they had already secured 50% of the payment due and accosted me each and every time I entered the building for additional payment despite the fact that we had 2 further nights to stay and me being very clear that the residual balance would be paid in full at checkout. 

This constant  harassment was uncomfortable, insensitive and unnecessary. It indicated that the hotel was unwilling to exercise discretion and flexibility.  This series of events marred what otherwise would have been a pleasant stay.",4,2017,09,26
18,"A gem. Outsdanding service, amazing staff and personalised care. The best hotel I have ever been. Fautless.","Difficult to write a review without repeating the excellent previous reviews.Thank you to Antonio and all his staff  (particularly Alexia, Anastasia and Diego) for looking after us and making our stay so memorable.
The service is top and very personalized. The staff call you by your name and do their utmost to please you. Luxurious, spacious, comfortable and spotless room in a great area close to all attractions  and amenities. We enjoyed having delicious Nespresso coffee in our room and daily sweet homemade treats in the evenings on our bedside tables. An amazing place to stay which I highly recommend. We will definitely come back.",5,2017,09,26
18,Beautiful hotel the serras,"This is one the best place i ever visit outstanding environment very peaceful and calm place, such a happening really enjoyed visiting. This hotel really mean to me with such a great services all around.",4,2017,09,26
18,"No words to explain this hidden haven, just go........","This hotel I chose from reading reviews on Trip Advisor, thank goodness for Trip Advisor.  My husband & I visited for 3 nights to celebrate our anniversary and what an amazing choice.  The attention to detail including, the comfort of the bed, the selection of pillows, the room layout, the immaculate perfectly designed bathroom, the lighting, the silence, the complementary Bose speaker, smart phone, coffee, tea, bottled water as well as wardrobe space, hidden huge mirrors, turn down service, cakes when you retire for the night, the discreet service of the maids, in fact we never saw one are just to mention a few.  The hotel even has its own scent pumped into the corridors.  We will be back again thanks you Serras team, I could select one or two however team members however I do believe that would be wrong as the training is so consistent such a service could not be provided with team work",5,2017,09,24
18,outstanding service and facilities,"My husband and I stayed here for four night in august of 2017. From the moment we walked through the doors and were offered a glass of cava as we checked in, to the moment we waved farewell, the hotel staff made themselves at our beck and call. They were all exceptionally friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Our room was quiet with double windows so we got absolutely no street noise, and our bed was deliciously comfortable. Every afternoon we loved lounging by the pool and having a glass of rose before dinner. It made a city vacation feel a bit like a resort, it was so relaxing and refreshing. The views of the harbor are beautiful and a wonderful departure from the hustle and bustle and close quarters of the gothic section of the city, where the hotel was located. 

We had the misfortune of being in Barcelona during the tragic attack on the city, but we could not have felt in better hands. The hotel staff and management stayed calm and in control throughout the crisis (and thank goodness no one from the hotel was hurt). 

The next time I return to Barcelona I will be staying here again, it's not even a question. Loved it! ",5,2017,09,23
18,A fantastic experience at an exceptional hotel,"I was made to feel exceptionally welcome from the minute entering this fantastic hotel, including a personal greeting from the manager Antonio, which was much appreciated. It is very clear that the staff go that extra mile to make your stay an enjoyable one, and the hotel has superb management, with highly trained staff.

It is a fantastic location for exploring the Gothic quarter and other famous sites are within a reasonable walking distance. 

The buffet breakfast was excellent – plenty to choose from – pastries, fruit, yogurt, cereal, fruit juices, bread, cheese; including a variety of cooked options.  The other worth noting is that the breakfast times run past 11am in the morning for those who enjoy a bit of a lie in. 

This brings me to my next point – sleep.  For several days I actually had nearly 9 hours sleep during my stay! That is unheard of for me, even on holiday. I am lucky if I get more than 6 – 7 hours. This is a testament to how comfortable and quiet the rooms are, including good options for black-out curtains. 

The facilities are good – a gym (which I didn’t make use of), a library bar and also the roof top bar with incredible views of the surroundings.  The rooftop is an ideal location to relax in between your holiday excursions/activities, or to finish the day before turning in for the night. The rooms have 2 services per day.

All in all this is a great place to stay to provide a relaxing and enjoyable base for your holiday – comfortable, staff that go above and beyond, good facilities, excellent food and good location. I would not even think about getting another hotel, and I will stay here again the next time I am in Barcelona without doubt.

Antonio – thanks to you and your staff for making my first Barcelona trip an exceptional one. Please pass this on. I wish it could have lasted longer.",5,2017,09,23
18,First rate,"The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring the city. And the place is outstanding in all other respects. Great buffet and à la carte breakfast choices. The staff were super helpful and friendly all along. Only 28 rooms, so plenty of scope for offering attentive, personalised service (without it becoming overpowering). The room we were initially assigned did not quite meet our expectations in terms of layout and location in the building, but the staff spared no effort to find us the perfect room starting on the second day, despite the fact that they were fully booked. I mean perfect from every respect, all our requests and needs satisfied. A special thanks to Maima (the reservations manager), to the general manager and to the front office manager (for their warm personal welcome) for making our stay in Barcelona truly memorable. Well done.",5,2017,09,22
18,Truly wonderful!,"This hotel is truly a wonderful gem in the best location in Barcelona.  Behind it the small streats and wonderful shops of Barrio Gothico.
The staff is absolutely amazing!
Love the roof top pool and terrace.

Definately reccommend if you want to experience the best in Barcelona.",5,2017,09,21
18,How I wish I could give 6 stars!!!!,"I now have a favourite hotel in Barcelona!!! This place is just wonderful. The staff are delightful and can't do enough for you. The rooms are an oasis of calm and excellently appointed. They had picked up we were staying before a cruise starting from Barcelona during which it was my wife's birthday, so when we walked into the room, there was a birthday cake, chocolates, and an ice cold bottle of fizz waiting for us. Typical of the great touches The Serras does. 
We had an issue with the shower - it was immediately rectified, things break/go wrong - how it is dealt with is the key
ALSO - the restaurant is superb ",5,2017,09,20
18,Fantastic Hotel and wonderful location,"First of all I will start by saying that a week before our visit I received an email from the hotel warning us of an upcoming taxi strike the day we were due to arrive.  They wondered if we had a way to get to the hotel.  We were planning on picking up a taxi at the airport as we did not want to try & figure out the train since it was our first visit to Spain and after a long overseas flight. So they arranged a car to pick us up which was perfect as sure enough, there was not a taxi to be found at the airport!  

Upon our check in, the lady that helped us was so informative and gave us so much information about suggestions and places to go which we took all in!  Then she escorted us up to our room which was on the 4th floor facing the Marina.  It was a Grand Deluxe Room which was nicer that it was a bit bigger.  As it faced the marina, we had good light in the morning.  There was a Nespresso Coffee machine in the room with several pods to enjoy and were replenished each day.   The bathroom was good size and had a nice walk in shower.  

The only issue with a room facing the Marina over Passeig de Colom is that there is quite a bit of partying on the streets till 1 or 2 in the morning specially on the weekends.    Didn't bother us too much but just mentioning it.  

Be sure to go up to the rooftop pool deck and enjoy a drink there and some snacks.  The barkeepers were very nice and accommodating and kept checking on us if we needed something more.   We didn't try the pool but it looked nice although small.",5,2017,09,20
18,Wonderful Hotelin the heart of Barcelona,"They say a hotel can be judged by its management and staff,well this hotel has superb management and staff in every way,knowledgeable,helpful well presented and trained to a high standard they are the epitome of perfect.The hotel itself is also spotless,with a great roof deck and pool.on the edge of the Gothic Quarter and ElBorn it is just so well situated.We shall stay again soon.",5,2017,09,18
18,"Very Nice Hotel, But Definitely Not 5-Star Service. ","After carefully selecting the best possible 5-star accommodations for our trip to Italy and Barcelona, I'm sorry to say that The Serras was a huge let down. 

While our accommodations were lovely, the staff had no interest in ensuring that we had a wonderful stay. We arrived at the hotel early and opted to hang out on the rooftop deck, until our room was ready. The staff never notified us when the room was ready. An hour past check in time, we finally inquired about the status and the room had been ready for a while. Throughout our stay, the staff never asked how our stay was, even as we sat down with them to check out. We never received turn down service, although one morning there was a card outside of our door that they attempted to provide turn down service the night prior, apparently after we returned to our room after 9:00 pm. 

We had a horrible experience at The Informal restaurant and since this boutique hotel is so small, it appeared that the entire staff was made aware of our situation and so rather than help make our stay more enjoyable, they all hid behind their computer screens every time we came thru the lobby.

We did receive a phone call the evening before check out, asking what time we planned to check out and if we needed a taxi or help with our luggage and then nobody showed up. We had to call to see if anyone was coming.

The rooftop staff was very nice, as were the doormen, but, the concierge staff could definitely use some training. When you're working at a very small 5-star boutique hotel, get to know your customers and acknowledge them. Look up from your computer screen every now and then and greet them, as they are passing by. Call them and ask them how their room is and see if you can do anything to make their stay more enjoyable. Make them feel welcomed and act like you care. After all, they are paying a hefty price to stay here.

Definitely not the type of service one would expect from a 5-star resort. ",3,2017,09,17
18,Super Fantastic!!!,"My husband and I arrived on a romantic vacation in Barcelona for a weekend (without our children), and followed  recommendations and stayed at the Serras Hotel, which exceeded all expectations!
The location is perfect. A 5-minute walk from la Boqueria and seconds from the stunning alleys of the Gothic Quarter.
The room was pleasant, inviting and indulgent.
And the food!!! The food was wonderful and we were thorough and checked all the restaurants in the hotel!!
El Informal is an experience and celebration for all senses! The breakfast is high quality and made of excellent products!
But the highlight is the team!
The staff is professional, pleasant, meticulous and yet very warm.
We opened each morning at a ""staff meeting"" to build the day's programs and received help, guidance and excellent recommendations that allowed us to relax in the chair and drink more mimosa :-)
We desired to have at least one dinner in a Michelin star restaurant and the staff worked on it every day in front of a number of restaurants until they succeeded and we had a table at the restaurant Lasarte which was wonderful.
Also, have managed to organize us excellent tickets for the game of Barca vs Espanyol in Camp Nou!
I would like to mention in particular 2 of the hotel's employees who have made our vacation no less than perfect: Alexia from the front desk and Sandra from the Informal which thanks to them and to the super fantastic vacation we had we are already planning our next vacation at hotel the Serras and this time with the whole family.

Many Thanks!!!!",5,2017,09,15
18,Fabulous experience from start to finish!,"My friends and I enjoyed a wonderful 3 night stay at the hotel.  The hotel is in a great location - close to the old town/gothic quarter and just across the road from Port Vell.  The hotel was beautiful.  Our room was large, with a fabulous bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  The roof top bar was the perfect place to relax with a drink and enjoy the views.  We had a delicious meal in the Restaurant Informal and also enjoyed the varied breakfast buffet offered.  As wonderful as the surroundings were, the one thing that set the hotel apart from anywhere else I have stayed before was the staff who were simply outstanding.  They couldn't have been more friendly, welcoming and helpful and they managed all of this without being at all intrusive.  A huge thank you to them for making our trip even more special!   ",5,2017,09,14
18,Excellent hotel,"My family and I stayed at this hotel on our way back from our Disney Cruise. The hotel staff was wonderful. They helped us arrange tickets to tour the city and even had a bottle of champagne and some snacks waiting for us in our room. The hotel had a pool on the roof deck and gym. The hotel restaurant food was very good and even served us when it was 35 minutes to closing. The rooms had everything you would need, even a spare cell phone to use while in Barcelona free of charge! I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in Barcelona. It is very close to the center of town- walking distance to anything you might want to do or see!",5,2017,09,12
18,Just wow thank you ,"I highly recommend this hotel perfect for the family. everything you needed was close by lovely view.
Staff very professional Also really good with the kids.
Lovely week with the family but hotel made it even better.",4,2017,09,09
18,Service fantastic,Second stay at the Serras. Our very smart room with comfortable beds and outstanding bathroom was on the third floor. The rooftop bar and pool was exceptional. Location on the edge of the Gothic quarter within easy walking distance to everything a big plus. Meal in the restaurant will never be forgotten. Service in this fantastic hotel tops everything.,5,2017,09,08
18,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Very tastefully decorated. Excellent service. Panoramic view from rooftop and centrally located. Front desk personnel were very polite , helpful and professional, in particular Alexia. Will not hesitate to go back. Thank you for a lovely but short stay of two nights.",5,2017,09,05
18,Great experience!,I'll definitely come back when visiting the city. The location is easy to access the city center. The staff is helpful and welcoming. The views and ambiance from the rooftop bar were great. Highly recommend!,5,2017,09,02
18,Birthday trip,"My daughter and I had a fabulous stay at The Serras, the standard of service was impeccable, firstly receiving an email a week before our arrival to ask if we had any food allergies, did we want any bookings made for the restaurant, special celebration etc. followed up by a phone call 48 hours to confirm our arrival. We were checked in by Diego the duty manager with a glass of cava a relaxed checkin whilst being seated and then a tour of the hotel. In our room was a complimentary bottle of cava and fresh fruit salad as my daughter is vegetarian. The room was of a good size and very clean, great bathroom and quality toiletries. The roof top bar with plunge pool was fabulous for a drink in the evening and the food in the restaurant was of excellent quality. We had an amazing stay and will definitely be back. The service and friendliness of the staff is unrivalled, I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and the closest for service is Raffles in Dubai, but the Serras surpassed this. A special thank you to Diego the duty manager, for his firiendliness and remembering my birthday !!",5,2017,09,02
18,Experience @ Hotel The Serras,"Incredible boutique lodging in an awesome area in Barcelona. The lodging straddles two incredible neighborhoods, the gothic quarters and the conceived region. What truly emerged however was the client benefit. Everybody at the inn went well beyond to make our stay agreeable. General we cherished this place and we would visit once more.",5,2017,08,31
18,Amazing experience and truly relaxing,"We chose The Serras after reading the reviews, for our family trip with two kids aged 4 & 1,5 to relax before flying back home. 

We were in awe about the experience. Wow... everything that's written about this hotel is true. The hotel is truly pampering, all amenities are provided and they go into the finest details to make your stay relaxing and unforgettable (they had little welcome gifts for our kids waiting including teddy bears, bath duckies and special shower gels for kids).

Breakfast is not included but definitely worth it, the restaurant itself is too, great food - some of the best in Barcelona. The pool is just big enough with a breathtaking view of the bay and a staff that makes great cocktails. All in all, a gem and a must visit for each traveler looking for something special. We will definitely be back!

Besides the above, it makes no sense writing a review as most reviews about this hotel say the same - excellent. You just NEED to experience for yourself. One of the best hotels we stayed in, period.",5,2017,08,29
18,Very Good Ambiance with professional and friendly staff!!,"The location is superb!!  very close to city center,  beach & shopping malls. With great amenities, huge and luxurious rooms. A wonderful place to stay. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Even food are super.They have good restaurants to choose from. ",5,2017,08,29
18,True 5 star hotel,"We picked this hotel after we've completed our Disney cruise prior to going home back to California the next day.  We're sad because we only stayed here for 1 night and wished we picked this hotel first prior to our cruise.  Hotel the Serras is located in a quiet neighborhood however you're just a 5-10 minute walk away from touristy attractions.

We arrived very early after we disembarked from our ship, we were at the lobby by 7:30 am which is very unusual to check in that early however the staff was very accommodating and helpful.  They offered complimentary coffee, water, and freshly squeezed orange juice for my 2 year old.  While we went ahead and checked in, they were sad to inform us that the room will not be ready until 2:00pm which is very understandable, they offered to keep our luggage and will bring it up to the room once it's ready.  We freshened up and went off for breakfast by 8:45am.  We arrived back at the hotel by 3:00pm and situated ourselves.  We were briefly given a tour of the hotel by their manager and were told that we were given an upgrade to room 301.  

The hotel and room were very chic and luxurious.  One of the better hotels I've ever stayed at.  They offered a complimentary 1L of bottled water, charcuterie and chocolates when we walked in, and a cellphone you can use while you're staying there.  The cellphone was very helpful because they offered complimentary wifi so you can use google map app and the best thing of the phone and the hotel is they are the only HOTEL in Barcelona to offer free long-distance phone calls which is a very big advantage.  

Their bed throughout the hotel are the same bed that the British royals utilize, It was very comfortable and quite an upgrade from the lumpy bed of the cruise ship.

THE....S H O W E R was very very nice.  The rainfall shower was marvelous after a long day's stroll.  This was way better than Le Meridien's version, I probably stayed inside the shower for 20+ minutes.  

Alas, we had to leave at 3:00am, the staff was very kind to assist us with our luggage and get us checked out.

Also, typically, you would avoid asking the concierge where to eat because majority of the time, they'll lead you to touristy establishments.  When we asked where to eat for paella, they recommended us to Meson Barceloneta which was the best paella we've ever tasted.  Great way to end our last night in Barcelona.",5,2017,08,28
18,Wonderful hotel,"My partner and I and my two daughters stayed in this hotel for two nights recently and had a wonderful experience.  It is extremely well situated, across the road from the marina and just a short walk to Las Ramblas.

We had disembarked at the end of our cruise and therefore arrived very early to the hotel.  Although the room was not ready (as expected), we were warmly greeted with drinks (Cava for the adults, juice for my youngest daughter), and the receptionist booked us tickets for Parc Guell for the following day and gave us restaurant recommendations.  They hailed a taxi for us so that we could go out for a few hours, and when we returned they showed us to our suite.

This was on the top floor and consisted of two ensuite bedrooms, joined by a small hallway, plus a sitting room and extra bathroom.  There was a complimentary bottle of Cava, some tapas, fresh orange juice and even mobile phones for our use with free internet and international and local calls.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, clean and modern, and ours had a huge bath in the room.  A large and supremely comfortable bed, a TV that rose out of a unit at the foot of the bed if required, and a well stocked mini bar.  The bathroom had twin basins and a huge shower cubicle which even had aromatherapy pods that could be inserted (a little like Nespresso coffee pods!).

Our room was facing the street but there was no noise due to extremely good sound insulation.  The air conditioning was effective and very quiet.

There is a lovely rooftop bar which serves cocktails and has a very extensive gin menu, and we ate in the restaurant for breakfast both mornings (excellent breakfast) and for dinner on our second night.  My daughter is coeliac, which we just happened to mention when we arrived and were looking for restaurant recommendations. Without any further discussion, at breakfast the following morning they brought a fantastic selection of gluten free bread and pastries. 

Dinner was superb - good, fresh food, beautifully and imaginatively cooked, and reasonably priced.

Every member of staff we encountered was warm, friendly, helpful and professional, and having stayed in many five star hotels around the world, I can honestly say that this is one of the best.  Expensive, yes, but absolutely wonderful, and I can't think of any area where they do not excel.  When leaving for the airport we were even seen outside to our taxi by two members of staff (one may have been the manager?) and made to feel like honoured and valued guests.",5,2017,08,28
18,Best place to sleep,"Some friend said to me that if I travel to Barcelona, I ought to sleep in this place, and I really have two nices night in this hotel. I enjoy the terrace and the pool in this hot summer in Barcelona. Good place to go",5,2017,08,28
18,Outstanding Hotel & Team,"The hotel rooms have the most up to date modern facilities and are spotlessly clean
The hotel is located in a great area for exploring the city
The facilities & restaurants  are first class
The team are what make the hotel extra special, nothing is too much trouble and everybody is helpful and happy!",5,2017,08,28
18,Modern Boutique Barcelona Hotel ,"The Serras is perfectly located for your stay in Barcelona. It's close to absolutely everything and sits on the esplanade on the edge of the gothic district. 

The staff were absolutely beautiful and could not do enough for you for the entire stay. 

The restaurant is Michelin quality so let them choose the dishes for you as we did. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2017,08,27
18,Memorable stay,"I’ve stayed in many hotels in Barcelona before and this one definitely stands out as the best for me. Service unlike others, giving me a different Barcelona experience. My room was luxurious, spacious, functional, and extremely comfortable. They take pride in their bed linens, and they well should. Gigantic bathroom comfortable and functional. Breakfast was a little pricey. Nice little rooftop dipping pool next to a bar with a great view. Great location, like most of Barcelona. Walking distances to sights and food. Five minutes taxi to the port if you are taking cruises. But it’s really the service there that has literally made my vacation.",5,2017,08,25
18,Service worth mentioning,"The best thing about Hotel The Serras is the service provided by the very attentive staff, almost to the personal level. They took the effort of leaving a cake and a bottle of Cava because it was my birthday on arrival. 

Every requests was attended promptly. House keeping cleaned our room twice every day and there are always little treats waiting at night on our bedside table.

We would like to thank especially Daniel from concierge, who helped us in every way and even wrote down suggestions of running trail, cheese tasting place etc.

Anastacia and Tiago for making the effort to get us a good deal on our room upgrade to Junior Suite (and it was worth it).

We are sad to leave this lovely hotel but we'll definitely come back the first chance we have! ",5,2017,08,24
18,"""You'll always have a second home in Barcelona....""","...and what a beautiful home that is. We stayed at The Serras for our first trip to Barcelona and it quite simply summed up all that is so wonderful about this fascinating city - generosity, warmth, colour and phenomenal style... Welcome home...again and again and again...X",5,2017,08,23
18,Boutique Luxury at its best,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated with outstanding service and care. Daniel- concierge, Daniella at checkin and Kristina at breakfast know how to look after their guests. A special mention to Antonio the GM who was fabulous warm and welcoming especially caring following the terrorist attack. ""The incident"" as they referred to it, did not dampen our love of Barcelona. The food at Informal restaurant was exceptional. Hotel the Serras- outstanding!",5,2017,08,23
18,Special trip for my husbands special birthday,"Maybe I should of got my husband to do this review as our mini break to Barcelona and staying at the fabulous hotel The Serras, was a surprise 50th birthday gift from myself to my husband. We stayed for 3 nights and booked a car through the hotel to pick us up from the airport, quite expensive, but a bit of luxury to start our holiday.  Check in went smoothly with a welcome glass of cava, then we were taken to our room, after being given a quick tour of the hotel. We loved our room, a lovely size and faced the front of the hotel towards the port. It was on the 3rd floor, excellent sound proofing and air con, hardly made a sound. The bed was comfy, great shower and we had a mini bar and tea and coffee making facilities.  Not forgetting the bottle of cava and birthday cake for my husband, which was a lovely surprise....thank you.
The hotel has a fantastic roof terrace, with plunge pool and bar. We enjoyed sitting here after a day out sightseeing, even though two of our evenings special events were being held at the hotel, so half of the roof terrace was closed, but the staff still found seating for us. All the staff were very efficient, helpful and friendly, this is a big part of why the hotel is so good. Hotel The Serras is also in a great location, easy reach of many attractions of Barcelona.  We had such a good time and we would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,08,22
18,Amazing staff and service,"My first review and I was inspired! The entire staff at the Serras was first class. From reception to check out, our stay was my favorite of many five star hotels from Paris to Barcelona. I look forward to my next visit. My heart goes out to Barcelona tonight.",5,2017,08,17
18,Highly Recommended Hotel ,"This hotel was one of the best we have ever stayed at.  Although a small boutique hotel, the staff are the best and most helpful. Views and location are fantastic and the room was very clean and comfortable.  ",5,2017,08,16
18,Beautiful rooftop views,I enjoyed a wonderful evening drink at The Serras - the rooftop view overlooking the pier in Barcelona is unrivalled. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. I would definitely recommend a visit and perhaps next time I will stay in their beautiful hotel!,5,2017,08,16
18,One of the best views in barcelona...,"We enjoyed the most delicious tapas and cocktails, overlooking one of the most spectacular view in Barcelona. The staff were exceptional, nothing was too much trouble and the experience could not be faulted. I'm already looking forwards to my return visit next year!",5,2017,08,16
18,Good,"A wonderful place, the people very frendly
The hotel is comfortable but still very ancient
The service of the staff is emthusiastic and agile
Its perfect choice
If there is a chance I will come back here with my family",4,2017,08,14
18,Beautiful Luxury Hotel,"Amazing relaxing time in this beautiful Luxury Hotel  the food is just gourmet and the amazing rooms make you not want to leave, the amazing staff can't do enough for you .... its the place to be for relaxation and pampering  just sitting at the bar near the pool is nice and chill",5,2017,08,14
18,Lovely hotel but expensive ,"While we enjoyed our two nights in The Serras, it is an expensive option compared to other hotels in Barcelona. The service is excellent, the decor is beautiful and the location is perfect but we stayed in another hotel in Barcelona for two nights also which was just as amazing but half the price. We were expecting a 'wow' factor from this hotel and I'm just not sure it delivered. ",4,2017,08,13
18,A true 5 star hotel!!!!,We stayed here while on a trip through the Mediterranean and it was fantastic!! The staff was great and greeted us with a glass of champagne!  The rooms were impeccable!  But the roof top bar was magnificent!!!,5,2017,08,12
18,Highly recommend :),"We stayed at this hotel, it was a wonderful experience!
The hotel is very well situated easy to walk around. 
We had dinner at Informal, I had the risotto, it qas delicious! You have to try the french fries, the best I ever had!
The service is excellent. The waitress at breakfast are SO NICE, especially María. 
We had the breakfast included and it is a very complete a full breakfast, the bakery and bread are very good. 
There is lovely terrace on the roof top with a small but beautiful swimming pool and a very nice view. 
I will definitely recommend this hotel. 
",5,2017,08,11
18,Perfect ,"We stayed at the hotels for four nights in July. We were visiting Barcelona to celebrate my husband's 40th. Even before we arrived, we knew the hotel would be special. We were called to see if there was anything that we required upon our arrival. 

Upon arriving, we were welcomed with cold drinks and as our room wasn't quite ready, we were able to organise our restaurant and excursion bookings. 

The hotel is beautiful, but it's the staff that really sets this place apart. Our 3 year old daughter was treated like a princess, she loved the attention the staff gave her and especially the trips to the secret sweetie jar! 

The rooftop pool was fabulous and whilst small, it provided a welcome relief from touring the city.

We ate breakfast at the hotel and also Sunday lunch. It was all delicious and again, the service was impeccable. 

Thank you Hotel The Serras for a wonderful stay. We will certainly return.",5,2017,08,11
18,AMAMZING HOTEL,"We loved love loved this hotel, it was the best stay of our Europe trip. The rooms are modern and clean and the bar and restaurant areas provide great food and drinks. Be sure to enjoy some time at the rooftop bar. The location is perfect to explore the city and safe to wander from at night. The staff make this hotel exceptional, from check in to check out we received amazing and personal service. Thank you for such a great stay! ",5,2017,08,08
18,Amazing boutique hotel - perfect in every aspect,"Spent a long weekend with my partner in Barcelona at the start of a two week Spain vacation, and the Serras couldn't have been more suitable. Small, luxurious, very well managed, with incredibly friendly unstuffy staff,  impeccable rooms and public areas - and with a location suitable to just about everything one may want to do in this great town. 

My partner and I travel a lot, have been fortunate to stay in some of the world's most wonderful places, and The Serras is way up there as a City hotel.  Thanks for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,08,07
18,Awesome stay!!,"Hotel Service was superb!!  Staff took care to greet us, arrange cabs, and leave us a nice welcome treat in the room for our honeymoon check in!  Rooms, bathrooms, and grounds were super clean and comfortable.  Rooftop terrace was sexy and they make great drinks! 

Hotel is located in a great spot, walking distance from the Port/Marina and the touristy street that includes La Boqueria Market (a must visit).  The beach is a far walk but a short cab ride and also very nice.

Would totally stay here again if in Barcelona!",5,2017,08,07
18,Not worth the money,"We recently returned from Barcelona after a one night stay at the Serras and a 10 day cruise. We cannot say enough about how disappointed we were with this hotel and do not recommend anyone stay there. On the first day after an 8 hour night flight we arrived at 9:30am and were told they would put a rush on having our room prepared. At 11:30am when we enquired about our room we were then told that the previous guests had not checked out yet and they had until noon to do so. At 1:00 we enquired again and were told that check-in was 2pm and we would have to wait and guaranteed the room would be ready by then. The room was not ready until after 2:00 (so much for putting a rush on the room). We had booked a sea view room for over 800 Euros and find we are on the 3rd floor facing trees and have absolutely no view at all. When we later enquired about this they said any room on the sea side was considered a sea view room. They did give us a reduced rate (600+ Euros) after complaining.
 At 6:30 pm the same day we receive a call from the front desk asking when we are checking out the next day as the hotel is very busy and we responded we would let them know in the morning. After a long day of travel we decide to go to bed early and at 10pm are awaken by another call from the hotel asking when we will be checking out the next day. After our return our travel agent emailed the hotel and they wouldn't even reply to her.",2,2017,08,07
18,Great little hotel ,Great little hotel near all the action.  Impeccable service.  Champagne on arrival and thorough explanation of everything in the hotel.  You get a free mobile device with a ton of local info for walking around down too!,5,2017,08,07
18,5 star all the way!!,"Wow, from location to a free upgrade, fantastic staff, amazing rooms, roof top pool and bar, and one of the best breakfast you could ask for... certainly going back to The Serras when I'm next in Barcelona .... ",5,2017,08,06
18,Perfect Location + great service = happy family!,"Our family of 6 (2 adults, 4 teens aged 14-19) had a great 4 night stay at The Serras!  The set up was perfect for 3 people in each room and the location was ideal for our first visit to Barcelona.  We enjoyed the rooftop bar and one of my daughters even worked on her college essay for a few hours up there.  It is a lovely spot to hang out and enjoy the afternoon/evening.  The staff worked hard to make sure we had towels for the beach, water bottles, taxis and a fabulous dinner in their restaurant and lots of great spots for tapas!  We will be back someday for sure!",5,2017,08,05
18,Perfect base for a city break in Barcelona,"This hotel is well located, very well equipped with beautiful interiors but what sets it apart is its staff. From the front desk to the housekeeping, every single member of staff we encountered with our three young children was absolutely charming and went out of their way to help us and make us feel welcome. They dealt with nosebleeds, and a marauding toddler and when I got tonsillitis they ensured that my husband survived the remaining trip on his own! The concierge spent lots of time making sure everything we did went well - even came running down the street after us at one point to tell us a particular museum was closed for refurbishment. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay there again ourselves. It is small and the pool is only good for a short dip but that really doesn't matter. The food in the restaurant is also fantastic - one of the best breakfasts we have had anywhere. If you are considering it - don't hesitate! You won't be disappointed.",5,2017,08,02
18,"Excellent Location, Excellent Service","We very much enjoyed our stay at The Serras.  This is a lovely boutique hotel just blocks from La Rambla.  All was perfect from the moment of our arrival.  We were greeted with a glass of cava and shown to our lovely, peaceful room.  The staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was wonderful!  We also very much enjoyed the beautful rooftop bar with views of the ocean and city.  I would highly recommend staying at this lovely hotel when in Barcelona!",5,2017,07,31
18,Excellent location and amazing 5 star hotel,"We stayed 4 nights in Barcelona. We had two connecting rooms in the hotel.  Hotel location, ambiance, food, service, beds, decor everything was 5 star. Highly recommend this hotel vs. W hotel (which I though was very dated and off location). Reception, door man, waitress all went above and beyond for service. Only thing negative was the pool was very tiny and breakfast had limited choices and very expensive. There are tons of cafe and restaurants behind the hotel. We found a pizza pattza which was pretty decent. Food in Barcelona was expensive compare to Madrid.
Weather in Barcelona was amazing at this time of the year although I think it's peak of the tourism. Streets were packed with people everywhere.",5,2017,07,27
18,Luxurious Boutique Hotel,"We have just enjoyed a wonderful 5 night stay at this exemplary hotel. Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived at check in to be greeted by one of the many friendly staff members and enjoyed a hot towel and chilled cava while we checked in. The room was excellent with a bottle of chilled cava and local delicacies waiting ,a very comfortable Hypnos Bed, excellent and plentiful  Malin and Goetz  toiletries and an excellent ( user friendly) shower. Each night a delicious little sweet treat was left by the bed - a lovely indulgence at the end if a hard day sight seeing. Breakfast was delicious- I particularly recommend the organic avocado sandwich ! We dined at the restaurant and had a lovely meal where amongst other delights we had the best Potatas Bravas in Barcelona! Another night the hotel booked a tapas bar for us when we were undecided as it started to rain- no problem as the manager gave us a glass of cava while we waited for the rain to stop then sent us on our way with a map. Llamber turned out to be an excellent recommendation. 
The roof top bar was intimate and the cocktails delicious. 
 The position of the hotel by the Born district, 10 minutes from the Ramblas and overlooking the harbour was very convenient.
I highly recommend .",5,2017,07,25
18,One of my favorite hotels in the world!,"My husband and i ended our trip to Spain with 4 fabulous days here. Perfection in every way. The location was a perfect base for exploring the Marina opposite, Las Ramblas a short distance away  and the entire Gothic Quarter. Our Junior Suite with Sea View was a sanctuary to come back to after long, hot days exploring and had every amenity you could wish for. The sound proofing was amazing, no sound from the street below...A special mention to the shower, my husband is still raving about the design! We didn't eat at the restaurants as I always prefer to get out into the city but we did speak to a couple who had eaten there every night of their stay and they had high praise for it. A special mention to Daniella at reception, she helped us with every request no matter how minor and every lunch and dinner recommendation we were given was spot on. Overall, the service was exceptional, I didn't get the busboys name when we were checking in but he was a joy to interact with for the duration of our stay. We travel extensively and always in boutique hotels and I can definitively say for a city hotel, this is one of if not the best. If you are debating whether or not to stay here, stop debating and just go ahead and make the booking!!!",5,2017,07,23
18,A true gem!!,"Fabulous hotel with world class service. Attentive, genuine and extremely helpful. It made our trip to Barcelona especially memorable. The restaurant, Informal, was outstanding.  Great food with great service as well.

We'll be back, for sure",5,2017,07,22
18,Stunning hotel with FABULOUS staff!,"I have traveled far and wide and this is by far on the top of my list of hotels. I had a million questions prior to arrival. I would email and get instant responses. Anastasia was always ready with an answer. The staff organized dinners and trips prior to our arrival which made everything go so smoothly.

We were greeted by Jan as soon as the cab pulled up (they do have a car that will pick you up, but the cab is cheaper). He brought up our bags clearly loving his job.  Jan also went out of his way to come to our room with recommendations, as he knew we were off to Begur. Other amazing receptionists were Daniella and Sergio. Meziane, who worked the rooftop bar, was so fun and interesting to talk to. And then there was SANDRA. I just loved her. I asked for coffee with half and half. She didn't know what that was and we laughed and laughed as I explained our strange American ways. Then she brought me half milk and half cream in different containers. And the next morning - there she was - waiting with my coffee! What a dream.

There were many other wonderful staff - I missed some of their names - give them all a raise! Everybody had a smile at all times.

The room - gorgeous. We had the standard room. It wasn't huge, but it was just perfect. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept  in! Big fluffy pillows - and great towels and robes. There was a small terrace where I hung my bathing suits to dry. The bathroom was brilliant. The shower was huge and had an awesome spray. There were 2 sinks, allowing my husband and me to have plenty of room.

The restaurant - We only ate breakfast. Very good food and again - Sandra made the meal special.

The gym- Small and complete with anything you need - treadmill, elliptical, some weights. There were also yoga mats.

The ROOFTOP- the best part. We just loved it. The pool is small, but just big enough for what you need. No, you can't do laps, but yes, you can cool off. There are lovely, cushioned chairs and waiters to attend to your needs. The cold water was a great touch. No need to bring water bottles. You can have tapas as a snack - I do believe they also serve lunch. 

TOUCHES - There was a bottle of champagne in our room waiting! As it turns out, we don't drink champagne - only wine. So they swapped it out! HOW NICE! We enjoyed going to the rooftop with our bottle before dinner.

You can't go wrong at this hotel!!",5,2017,07,19
18,Absolute Class in fabulous location,"What a fantastic finish to our 6 week soujourn in Spain. Magnificent location opposite the Marina and in the Gothic area. Greeted by sincere smiling faces as we completed our check in with complimentary Cavos. Hotel decor and ambience classically understated- superb. Only 28 rooms we felt like we were guests in a beautiful home. Nothing was left to chance in the rooms- attention to detail excellent- superior comfort. Rooftop bar - and restaurant both excellent. Overall a stunning experience- well worth the price- and we will be back.
Judith- Australia",5,2017,07,18
18,"Great Location, service and attention to detail","I just returned from 14 days in Spain and was lucky enough to spend the last three nights at The Serras.  Upon arrival we were greeted by happy staff members, a warm towel, glass of  water and then a mimosa and the service continued at that level throughout our stay. The rooms are high quality and I particularly enjoyed the baked treats and water left by our bed at night. The Location is great; just a short walk to the Picasso museum and great boutiques and restaurants.  The Roofdeck was a great place to relax and have cocktails after sightseeing.  I highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again.",5,2017,07,18
18,Excellent stay! You won't be disappointed,The Serras Hotel is a beautiful boutique hotel overlooking the marina. I can not say enough about the staff. They were friendly and helpful with every detail. We received a glass of champagne upon arrival and found sweets at night in our room. The rooms are amazing contemporary with a classic flare. The showers are uniquely equipped with aroma therapy infusions. Absolutely relaxing. Don't miss the rooftop pool and bar. Drinks are fabulous as well as the views.,5,2017,07,15
18,Incredible 50th Birthday supprise,"The hotel Serras is the best hotel I have ever stayed at in Europe.The hotel organised the most wonderful supprise for my wife's 50th birthday.It first started with the Guest relations emailing me the great supprise that we organised .To their word they arranged the most gourgous roses on arrival and hid my daughter at the rooftop bar , without letting on the lovely receptionist greeted us at the car and escorted us in to the lobby and then arranged to show my wife a tour around (she not knowing that my daughter who she had not seen for nearly 12 months was awaiting with a beautiful 50th birthday cake and Champagne).
This was a 50th for her to remember.This hotel gos above and beyond to make your stay special and it was thanks to all the wonderful stay at this hotel , everyone from the great girls on reception to the to die for restaurant where the food is absolutely fantastic and again service is amazing to the doorman who helps you in every way possible to make your stay special, but it starts at the top special thank you to the general manger Antonio who met with staff that morning to organise and make sure they kept that wonderful supprise was kept so secret and special.Also took the time to hunt us down the next morning to make sure every went to plan , a very very special hotel
 By the way the rooms are beautiful and well appointed.
Back soon guys thank you once again for everything 
Regards
Denis",5,2017,07,15
18,Incredible Boutique hotel ,"After reviewing other critiques on Trip Advisor, I decided to stay with my husband for 5 nights at The Serras on my first trip to Barcelona. It's a fabulous location facing the waterfront, on the edge of the Gothic Quarter. So close to many sights- La Rambla, La Boqueria , the Picasso Museum and the Barcelona Cathedral just to name a few. The rooms are very modern, they give you a phone to help you navigate the city streets and  leave you a scrumptious treat nightly😁. The restaurant food day or night is fabulous but the real star is the staff. They greet you with a smile, drink, offer of help, set up itineraries . I want to recognize Angela and the Daniels x 2 who went above and beyond in this beautiful city. I can go on and on. Just check it out for yourself !",5,2017,07,13
18,Only place to stay in the Serras,"The staff was awesome and was extremely helpful. The housetop bar is great and the room was perfect, with not a thing out of place. The location can;t be beaten with easy access to the shoreline and all the well known spots an easy stroll away. When in Barcelona, stay here!",5,2017,07,12
18,Nice stay,"We booked this hotel almost a year a head of our stay based on trip advisor and a friend who stayed.  Overall it was a very nice place.   Location and front desk staff were great.    Rooms are nice and quiet. I couldn't give it a 5 star because we found the pool bar service at the pool to be very slow.   On 3 different occasions we went up for drinks at the pool and found ourselves waiting a long time to get drinks (20-25 minutes from time of ordering). Usually there was one nice bartender who just moved way to slow.  Also I came to the pool one morning at 1030am and it was filthy with stuff floating on surface.  I was surprised it hadn't been cleaned from the day before.    
Close to a 5 star but not quit. Again front staff were awesome",4,2017,07,12
18,GREAT – though our room size was far far TOO SMALL !,"Stayed at the Serras for 4 nights in June, and on most counts it ticked all the boxes you expect from a 5 star luxury boutique hotel. Service standards throughout the hotel were superb, with the tone set by a warm and personalised greeting upon arrival (accompanied by complimentary cava), followed by a tour of the hotel's smartly designed and beautifully furnished public areas, including the wonderful rooftop plunge pool/ bar area which offers panoramic views over the harbour and the many mega yachts moored there. Despite it being quite crowded at times because of private functions there, we always managed to find a seat to sample the excellent range of drinks on offer.  While we didn't eat breakfast in the hotel's Michelin star restaurant, El Informal, we enjoyed two excellent dinners there with the food, wine and service all top tier. The Serras' location is perfect to explore the historic Gothic Quarter and adjoining El Born area, which both contain a multitude of shopping and dining options (be sure to visit the Picasso Museum which is only a few minutes’ walk from the hotel and is well worth the queue time). We also walked through the winding alleys and laneways of this historic part of town to the city centre, Eixample and the city's main high end shopping strip along Passeig de Garcia. 
Despite all its pluses, including above all it's superb staff, our stay at the Serras didn't quite match that of some of the other similar standard properties we booked such as the Mercer in Seville because of the very compact room we were allocated. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have booked a Grand Deluxe room (which we viewed since a friend was staying in this category), rather than a Superior Room, as we found the latter MUCH too cramped to comfortably accommodate us and our luggage. As a side note our room featured a different layout to the Superior room photos depicted on the hotel's website (and certainly felt smaller than the promoted 30 sq. m size) so am uncertain as to whether they have different categories of this room type, as ours certainly didn't have enough space to contain a 2-seater sofa at the end of the bed as the website depicts. Also on our last night water began leaking from the bathroom ceiling onto the floor, however to the hotel's credit this was rectified by the time we returned from dinner. We would definitely stay at the Serras if visiting Barcelona again but for the reasons above would select the larger and more expensive room category, as all rooms feature excellent double glazing and super comfortable beds, resulting in a good night's sleep.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND - with a more expensive room choice!",4,2017,07,11
18,Great location and world class hospitality,"We stayed here for the outstanding location walking distance to everything from the beaches to the historic sites of the city, but it is the commitment to hospitality that will bring us back. It is very clear from your first entrance here that management wants the guests to be happy. From the glass of wine at check in, assisting with tickets to sites, restaurant recommendations with reservations, supplying mobile phones with google maps to the guests, spacious comfortable rooms, comfortable rooftop lunge with small pool and huge gin tonics, beach towels for the beach, to coffee to go when calling the cab to the airport, they do it all. We cannot recommend it more highly
",5,2017,07,10
18,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Beautiful hotel & décor, great location and stunning sea and marina view, every person working in the hotel is really good looking also =) Food and drinks on the roof top were top notch, pool is a quite small but still very nice. The service was 5*+ at this hotel very friendly and helpful staff. They even offer you a mobile phone that comes with every room to use and take around the city, you can make free calls anywhere in the world, use maps, data which is a really cool idea I had not seen before. 

My only complaint has to do with the room, there is a glass wall that separates the bathroom and where the bed is, the glass is dusted so its not completely see through, but its still kind of see through, and the toilet and the bed are right next to each other just separated by this dusted glass. I was sharing the room with a male friend which made going in the bathroom a bit awkward feeling as you can literally see when someone is at the toilet.",4,2017,07,10
18,The most amazing staff make the stay perfect ,"This is a beautiful, luxury boutique hotel.  It was worth the money.  We booked ahead and prepaid which offered a nice savings.

The most valuable part of this hotel is it's amazing staff.  I fully regret not taking down names to call them out here, but we had two doorman who were so friendly and charming and who also gave great tips and suggestions.  We also had two women who worked the desks and served as concierges as well.  

If you drive there, the initial parking is weird because it looks like you are stopping in the middle of a very busy street.  But pull up.  They jumped out of the hotel to help us - doorman and two hostesses.  They greeted us with cava and water and immediately asked us if we had made plans in advance to see Park Guéll and La Sagrada Familia.  They then went on line and booked both for us, and printed out our passes.  So nice to be in good hands!  They also explained the metro and which passes to buy (we never used our car bc the metro is so easy).  

After a personal tour of the hotel, we got to our suite to find cava and tapas waiting for us with a beautiful note for our 25th Anniversary.  What a special treat - thank you!!!  

The staff suggested wonderful restaurants, made reservations for us, printed out maps, and were amazing in every way.  

We relied on the roof several times for several hours. What a luxury.  Comfortable, great view of the harbor and more great service.  Best sangria with out a doubt.

Stay here.  The location can't be beat. They define the reason why you stay at a boutique.",5,2017,07,10
18,Great experience,"My Husband and I spent through 5 days at The Serras while on a 2 week holiday....The lodging staff was brilliant and was extremely useful in every one of all angles. We adored the housetop bar and specialty mixed drinks. The room was impeccable, with an agreeable bed, lovely conveniences and treats. The washroom was perfect, lovely marble, and not little which is an or more in Europe. The area was immaculate, opposite the shoreline and strolling separation to the vast majority of the well known spots. At the point when in Barcelona, we will return once more.",5,2017,07,10
18,Peaceful Luxury in Barcelona,"We arrived at this beautiful, boutique hotel after a long week of bike riding and road tripping through Costa Brava. Our family was a tad weary and the minute we stepped though the hotel doors, our senses were revived. The welcome staff was wonderful before we arrived (thank you Daniella!) and also upon our arrival. We had two rooms on the 5th floor overlooking the city and they were warm, modern, and so quiet in an otherwise vibrant city. We enjoyed cava and sangrias on the rooftop which overlooked the port and appreciated all the small touches this hotel took to make our stay welcome and feel like home. The staff member that stole all our hearts was Sandra who greeted us warmly every morning for breakfast. She was beyond professional and yet so caring- especially to our kids who couldn't wait to see her each morning. They were saddest to leave her! Thank you Sandra and we will be back to see you another time soon. Thank you again to the entire staff. Your hotel is a gem.",5,2017,07,08
18,Excellent service on the rooftop bar!,"I've visited the rooftop bar of The Serras for a casual afternoon drink during one of my many trips to Barcelona. I would really recommend to visit this place if you like a relaxed atmosphere, high quality products and excellent service. Our waitress Tamara made sure we felt welcome and served us on a personal level, striving to maximize guest satisfaction with a very professional attitude.",5,2017,07,05
18,Great Boutique Hotel,"My wife and I spent 3 days at The Serras while on a 3 week holiday....The hotel staff was wonderful and was very helpful in all all aspects. We loved the rooftop bar and craft cocktails. The room was perfect, with a comfortable bed, beautiful amenities and goodies. The bathroom was clean, beautiful marble, and not small which is a plus in Europe. The location was perfect, across from the beach and walking distance to most of the popular places. When in Barcelona, we will return again.",5,2017,07,04
18,A wonderful week at the Serras,We couldn't be happier with our choice of the Serras and its Grand Suite Mediterraneo.  The staff throughout is top-notch being both competent and friendly.  The Informal restaurant serves delicious food in a small comfortable setting.  Location is amazing allowing easy access to Gothic quarter and the waterfront promenade and restaurants.,5,2017,07,04
18,Excellent,One of our best options to stay in Barcelona. Truly a gem and will recommend you guys to our family back home. The terrace is awesome and the staff super attentive. I loved the smell of the place when you enter. Bathrooms are super clean.,5,2017,07,02
18,5 star boutique in a great location,"From the moment we arrived and were treated to Cava and OJ to our check out process, the staff was incredible. Everyone really is there to serve you! An example is leaving treats and bottles of water each night and always greeting us as if we just returned home. The room (we had the grand deluxe) was spacious and modern with exquisite design. The location is perfect (15 min to beach, 10 the Las Ramblas and El Born). The rooftop is a also a really nice touch. Note that it's open to the public after 8 pm, but wasn't ever crowded. The view of the port is phenomenal. There is a really nice restaurant, Informal, with a Michelin starred chef, Marc Gascons, on the first level, but we never tried it. Was always popular though.

This is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in during our travels. It was a refuge after days at the beach and I hope I get the opportunity to stay here again in the future.",5,2017,06,29
18,GORGEOUS BOUTIQUE HOTEL,"The Serras was a beautiful and well maintained boutique hotel. As soon as we pulled up we were escorted into the hotel by staff. We sat to check in and they immediately asked if we would like a hot cloth to freshen up with, and offered us a cold beverage. The staff was amazing and made you feel right at home. We booked a suite for five nights and it was really beautiful and extremely clean. We also  enjoyed the rooftop pool along with a great assortment of cocktails and food for lunch. Our stay was awesome and I would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5,2017,06,28
18,Great Experience! ,"I am so happy we got to visit this lovely hotel. 

We heard they had a special evening on the roof for San Juan but were unable to get reservations at first, luckily we tried again and enjoyed a lovely night on the rooftop top overlooking the port areas of Barcelona. 

The staff was amazing. I didn't get everyone's name but Sergio was so welcoming, and our server was delightful. She didn't rush us at all, offered a great gin tonic recommendation and was able to even run to the chefs and ask about the delicious cauliflower scallop starter. 

After dinner we enjoyed the rest of our bottle of wine by the pool as the fireworks started. Loved being able to enjoy the holiday but far away from the madness of the beach. 

Thank you so much for everything! I know we will be back soon.

18,Amazing service oriented hotel!,"Fantastic boutique hotel in a great location in Barcelona.  The hotel straddles two great neighborhoods, the gothic quarters and the born district. What really stood out though was the customer service.  Everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable.  Overall we loved this place and we would definitely visit again.",5,2017,06,18
18,Barcelona Boutique Luxury at it Finest!!!,"The service by all staff members is fantastic!
Superb restaurant.
Roof Top Bar has amazing view as well as great charm!
Room is very tastelyfuly designed and contemporary.
Situated  close to the marina 
Building is a heritage building with a link to Picasso.
Well worth a visit and i will return in November 2017.",5,2017,06,16
18,Stunning hotel,"Top-notch hotel in a beautiful location.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating in all ways.  We never felt like there was a question we couldn't ask, and they really went out of their way to make our stay comfortable.  The rooms are beautiful and well-decorated, and there are many delightful touches, such as a bottle of cava upon arrival, and delicious homemade treats in the evening delivered at turndown service.  The breakfast is exquisite, and we looked forward to seeing and chatting with Sandra every morning, who always helped us start our morning out right.  Dinner at Informal, the restaurant, was quite a treat.   My husband and I spent every night unwinding and enjoying the views from the rooftop bar.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would 100% recommend.",5,2017,06,12
18,Wonderful hotel,"Beautiful boutique hotel. Received pre visit calls inquiring about any special needs or circumstances. Excellent location at the southern edge of the Gothic district on the harbor. Easy walk to the Ramblas, Cathedral and El Born and Barceloneta. Spacious room was outstanding. Very comfortable bed. Spacious shower. Accommodates US plugs, good wifi and a complementary smartphone to use while visiting. Overall service, including arranging of site visits, was excellent. Roof top bar is special with excellent views of the harbor. A perfect place to stay in a wonderful city. We would make The  Serras a permanent home if we could.",5,2017,06,12
18,Awesome staying,"Very sofisticated hotel. Really cozy and confortable rooms, beautiful design, the services are awesome and really kind. would recommend a second time. The location is perfect, probably one of the best places to be in barcelona.",5,2017,06,07
18,"Best service and kindness, perfect  hotel.","I stayed there  4 nights with my wife. Before Barcelona I stayed Madrid and I lost my jackets , my wife as well. So we contact Madrid hotel and send our jackets to series but they refuse and ask that I send a man who can pick up our jackets. So I contacted the hotel Serras and Diego( manager of Serras) contacted the hotel at Madrid and he arranged pick up . So we can return back our jackets before departure to our country. Usually I don't think that I  can get our jackets as we contacted Thursday and there a weekend( we depart on Tuesday). But Diego showed warm kindness.
My from was clean and very delicious breakfast -- my wife really like croissant and jam there.
The series staff are all kind and problem solving attitude for travelers.
I hope to stay next year.
Thanks, Diego and all staffs!

Best wishes, Jeon",5,2017,06,04
18,Barcelona trip,Excellent hotel and staff are very attentive. Fantastic room on the 5th floor. Nice and quiet. Turn down service offers a nice little treat each night. Amazing view across the harbour from the roof terrace which has sun beds and a small plunge pool. Wine is reasonably priced. ,5,2017,06,03
18,Impeccable service,"Conveniently located near the waterfront, roughly equidistant from La Rambla, the Museu Picasso & Barceloneta, this boutique hotel (formerly a studio for Picasso) is a wonderful base for exploring BCN. Rooms are clean & elegant (with strong water pressure & air conditioning), very quiet with blackout curtains, & the bed was super-comfortable.

Dinner (as well as breakfast) at the attached Restaurante Informal was superb, & service throughout our 5 day stay was top-notch. We especially appreciated the authentically friendly staff (including front desk, concierge, bell captains, restaurant staff & housekeepers), who all made us feel entirely at home. We'll be back!",5,2017,06,03
18,Holiday ,A really nice hotel where everyone and everything is just right. We stayed three nights in the cheapest room and it did not crimp on space or function. The welcome was great as our flight had been delayed a 1hr. Free cava is always welcome. The location is very good for all attractions. We walked everywhere and enjoyed the street scenes ,5,2017,05,31
18,Warm Spanish hospitality and extraordinary service!,"Beautiful hotel on the scenic waterfront of Barcelona.  Traditional architecture beautifully preserved on the outside,and lovely modernization on the interior.  Building has space once used by Picasso as a studio.  Multi-story, with a fabulous roof-top terrace.  Multiple options for dining.  The staff are very well trained, multilingual, and greeted me at the door of my limo, literally, with the traditional Spanish warmth and hospitality.  Checking in was more of a gracious social occasion than just being processed into a system, very leisurely and comfortable at a private desk in the lobby area.  I was taken for a tour of the hotel, with beauty everywhere I looked.  Smiling staff, immaculately clean property, with the feeling of touring a royal townhouse, perhaps, rather than a hotel.  My room was wonderful, with two large double-door windows which opened onto small balconies.  The view was of the yacht marina, main street below, and generally very scenic (gorgeous sunrise the next morning as viewed from one balcony window). A tray of tapas and bottle of wine were nicely set up on a table to welcome me.  Excellent climate control in the room, efficient AC and silent room all night long.  I never heard anything from within the hotel or the busy street outside..  Every luxury convenience possible was in the room, with a cell phone and internet tablet allowing generous use both locally and to call internationally.  Upscale toiletries and nice thick towels.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in - a huge king, multiple pillows, fabulous night's rest which was badly needed by the time I arrived in Barcelona.  Mini-bar and fridge in the room, plenty of good lighting options.  This room would be marvelous for a romantic weekend or honeymoon couple - there is a huge, old-fashioned free-standing bathtub in one part of the large bedroom - in front of one of the balcony windows.  Very romantic!  There is a large TV concealed in a cabinet at the foot of the bed, and the TV rises out of the cabinet via a remote control.  The bathroom was very large, with a big walk-in shower with a rain shower and hand spray.  A small compartment within the bathroom had a toilet and bidet, and had a sliding door for privacy.  Double sinks in the bathroom, more elegant toiletries and towels.  Everything was spotlessly clean and new.  I did not eat breakfast, but ordered an early lunch from room service to enjoy in my room.  Friendly staff member who spoke far better English than my elementary Spanish, very courteous, and delivered a beautifully set up tray quickly.  Wonderful home-made multi-cheese macaroni pasta meal, generous sized serving, a real treat with very good flavor.  I did not have time to see or enjoy much of the hotel's many amenities on this trip, as I was leaving on a cruise that morning.  However, I would definitely stay there again, with great pleasure, and highly recommend the property for its superb and flawless service in a gorgeous property with a very nice location in busy big Barcelona.  Muchas gracias to the lovely staff at The Serras who made my visit so very special and memorable.",5,2017,05,30
18,Nice hotel but overpriced junior suite,"We stayed for 5 nights at the Hotel The Serras in a sea view Junior Suite. Unfortunately we were on the second floor and had no view of the sea at all from our room but rather a view of the cars driving by. The view from the top floors is outstanding but rooms on the second floor should not be priced at the same rate as higher floor rooms. Service was excellent throughout the hotel. The room was much smaller than other suites we had in Spain. Floors 2 and 3 have sofas in the living area whereas floor 4 and 5 have a bathtub but no sofa. While we enjoyed the location and personal service, we felt the hotel was overpriced, particularly for the junior suite on the second floor.",4,2017,05,28
18,Best hotel service ,"We visited Barcelona for 10 days. 5 days spent at the Serras, I wish all 10 days were there. 
From before we arrived the service was amazing. I was emailed and phoned before our visit with confirmation of our stay and offers for reservations at restaurants, you name it what ever we needed. 
When we arrived the check in was great we felt like friends of the hotel not customers, this continued through the entire visit. 
I could go on about the customer service but won't, it was the best I ever experienced at a hotel. 
The hotel location was perfect close to the beach and the Gothic quarter, also a close walk to our favorite neighborhood El Born. 
The room was luxurious, good sized and very clean. Great bed and shower. There was even a complimentary cell phone to use during the visit. Nice touch. 
El Informal had amazing food at all meals and the staff were great. Lovely to chat with over breakfast. 
I'm going to stop now, just do yourself a favor and book this hotel. If you don't like it there is something wrong with you. ",5,2017,05,26
18,Too nice!,Location was excellent in the gothic quarter and we already had high expectations of the room and were not let down! We upgraded and the suite was fabulous but from what I saw of other rooms they would be really comfortable too. The roof terrace was best of all - too nice really as we sat up there longer than we planned really instead of heading off around town! Look forward to coming back.,5,2017,05,26
18,excellent!,"Very nice restaurant close to the see. Roof bar with wonderful view. Food is excellent, mainly tipical spanish. Service is very good and fast.
Possible to have a separate dining room for private events. ",5,2017,05,26
18,"Phenomenal Service, Comfort & Location","From walking in the front door to check out the hotel, its staff and experience was phenomenal.  

Staff greeted us by name walking into the hotel as the check in process included champagne, orange juice, water and a moist towel to cool off.  The check in area are simply two casual desks and the attendants were more than gracious explaining information about the hotel, room and surroundings followed by showing us in person information they had explained including the room.

The bed was simply one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in as it was an Eastern King bed (wider).  The Bluetooth for music was great along with the technology in the room, and other amenities.  The view from the Jr Suite towards the ocean was majestic.

A pleasant surprise was the hotel offering a complementary cell phone to be used throughout the city for maps and at no additional cost includes international calls to parts of Europe, Canada and the US.  While the technology is new and there are some bugs to work out the hotel has without question figured out key ways to assist guests.

An attendant, Daniel, greeted us by name each time he saw us and held brief conversations.  Simply a phenomenal and genuine person.

Kudos to the hotel and its staff for its business platform and offering.  Will plan on staying here the next time around.",5,2017,05,26
18,Beyond AMAZING! ,"First, I will say that we have never been to the city of Barcelona. I chose the hotel based on its reviews and location to Gothic Quarters.  Upon arriving to our hotel we were completely blown away by the client relations and friendliness of each and every member of the staff.  They greeted us with smiles every time we walked through the doors.  My husband and I have grown to prefer smaller boutique hotels rather than the larger chains. This one far exceeded any expectations I had. It's a very chic hotel with clean lines, modern flair, yet cozy and comfy at the same time.   The rooms are spotless and completely stocked with great amenities; shampoo, soaps, lotions, etc.  As if we hadn't eaten enough during the day upon every nightly turn down the staff left beautiful little pastries and bottled water.  We spent a few afternoons after touring the city up on the beautiful rooftop terrace and ended there nightly with a cocktail.   Such a added bonus to this location.   I will certainly be passing on my recommendation of this hotel to all of my travel friends in the states. Best of luck to you all here, I hope to be back in the near future.   (A few extra tips, I highly recommend is renting bikes as it was a very efficient way to see all of the beautiful attractions. A few favorite restaurants are as follows…Llamber,  La Pepita, Sensi Gourmet Tapas and Bruch & Cake.) ",5,2017,05,23
18,A delightful small hotel near the Gothic Quarter and the harbor.,"This is a wonderful hotel in a great location. The roof top pool at bar have a spectacular view. The hotel has some of the most modern and innovative furnishings I have seen (for example, a Samsung smart phone you can take with you with unlimited telephone and internet as you walk around Barcelona!). If you have the funds and the opportunity, I would suggest an upgrade to one of the larger rooms; the standard rooms are a bit small and the king bed takes much of the floorspace. But all the rooms are well appointed and impressive, as are the common areas. The restaurant on site is fine, too. A lovely place to stay!",5,2017,05,22
18,Almost five but...,"The service is excellent, the rooms are beautiful, the beds are super comfortable and the roof top bar is lovely. But it is a bit pricey for what you get. Breakfast is 26 Euros and It's good but not spectacular. Moreover and we had a slight smell in our room. So really good but not perfect.",4,2017,05,22
18,Great location and excellent service!,We love this hotel! Our second visit. The manager made sure to introduce himself. Had a lovely room -206. Bed is super comfy. The location is perfect. Shower could be a bit stronger. Don't miss the roof top terrace. We will return. ,5,2017,05,21
18,AMAZING,"Went on a trip with my sisters and mother The Serras is a wonderful hotel. The staff is polished, professional,helpful, mostly students on internships working to perfect their craft.  They have succeeded",5,2017,05,20
18,Worth every cent,"This was a first time break to the beautiful city of Barcelona for a special occasion.  The staff made it very special, the personal friendly service out of this world.  This made our trip a very happy memory.  But don't limit your stay to three night, make it longer.",5,2017,05,19
18,"Incredible service, great location","My wife and I visited for our anniversary and the hotel staff could not make our stay better.  They helped arrange restaurant reservations ahead of time, upgraded our room, provide a free bottle of Cava as part of our celebration, and were always on hand and quick to respond to any issue from irons to coffee in the room.  The rooftop deck was a nightly visit, and the location near El Born and still a walk to the beach was perfect. Also, they provide a free phone that has locale service and able to make calls to the US (for us) as part of the room, so handy to not have to pay foreign data charges and we used it constantly! But again, more than anything, it is the incredible staff that makes this hotel amazing.",5,2017,05,18
18,Perfect boutique property!,"Every moment at The Serras from check in to check out was flawless.  The Serras staff exhibits some of the best customer service we have ever experienced!  The property is exceptional -we have stayed in many upscale, boutique hotels around the world and this one rates right up at the top!  Upon arrival, we were warmly  welcomed at the front door, given a lovely glass of cava during the check in process and then a personalized tour of the property.  It was mid morning and our rooms were not ready so we went out touring and the lovely Elizabeth at reception called us on our cell phone to let us know when our rooms became available.  The sleeping rooms were well designed and very comfortable.  The bathroom was lovely, with a large walk in shower.  Each room comes with a cell phone which you can use for calls back to the US, pictures, google maps, looking up restaurants and attractions etc.  What a unique touch!  The rooftop bar is magical - such a magnificent view over the Barcelona waterfront.  They have portable, rolling heaters which were very unique and perfect for an evening with a slight chill in the air.  The hotel restaurant, Informal, was truly ""over the top""!  We had dinner there on the first night of our stay and every part of the meal was excellent.  We also enjoyed the buffet breakfast which was delicious and beautifully presented.  
The location of The Serras is perfect -  adjacent to the Gothic Quarter and across the street from the bustling waterfront area, the hotel is close to historic sites, great shopping and wonderful cafes and tapas bars. 
I would highly recommend this hotel and the restaurant to anyone traveling to Barcelona who likes a small, intimate property with top notch customer service!",5,2017,05,18
18,Wonderful!!!!,"I don't know how many ways to say I love this hotel! The rooms were comfortable, modern and clean.
They have a very small pool, more like a soaking pool, but it was very nice. There was also a small and intimate deck overlooking the water and the harbor. It was a perfect place to sit and have a drink and see all the action but yet be removed from the crowds.
The staff was very warm, friendly and helpful to us every step of the way. I wish I could suggest some way they could improve, but everything was flawless!",5,2017,05,18
18,Perfect location,"Modern hotel near the beach and in the Gothic Quarter. Apart from our visit to Park Guell, we went everywhere on foot as the hotel is well-located. The rooms are small but thoughtfully designed, so you still get a comfy place to sit down rather than having to perch on the bed. The staff are great - genuinely welcoming and helpful. The rooftop terrace looked very nice but we were out and about every day and didn't use it. The restaurant is very good (separate review). Additional nice touches were the little treats left for us at turn down each nice - very superior in comparison to other hotels! Would I stay again? Yes. As I say, you don't get loads of space but what you do get works well and the hotel is well-positioned for days just trotting around Barcelona. A tick.",5,2017,05,18
18,5*,"I choose this hotel as I always go by online reviews,
Stayed here April 11th for 1 week and wow what a fantastic time me and my wife had.
This hotel lives up to all the expectations and more.
One of the best places in Spain I have stayed.
Thank you for a great stay I shall be returning in the future. I will also be recommending this hotel to friends and family.",5,2017,05,17
18,Fantastic team and hotel! ,"Tophotel. Very service driven staff, rooms were clean and beds very comfortable. Doorman is very helpful guy and guest services always there to help. Next time in Barcelona I will certainly stay here again. ",5,2017,05,15
18,Luxury In the center of it all,"Perfectly situated in the center of everything you will want to do and see in Barcelona. The hotel is immaculate. The staff are gracious and attentive. The restaurant is amazing. The roof deck bar has great views day & night (however, service is slow). You may pay more than expected but you will feel pampered and it's worth it.

P.S. Picasso's first studio was located in this building. Very cool!",5,2017,05,15
18,Excellent experience with great service but ... overpriced,"We chose this hotel because of the great reviews, its location (different from where we normally go) and the luxurious set-up and decoration.

The location is close to la Barceloneta, and there is a different vibe about this location than f.ex. plaza de Cataluna or the spacious chic Paseig de Graca.

This is a hotel with a concept and a vision.
The building infrastructure and the decoration are great: spacious income, super restaurant, amazing rooftop, cosy little library with bar, lovely rooms, chic corridors, ...

Our room, a mini (because the space is not that big!) suite with balcony overlooking the Passeig de Colom and the harbor, was very well designed and has a luxurious decoration, spacious bathroom (sinks, shower and toilet) and two large windows (NB: there can be noise in the room when you open the windows). Having a bath in the room, while having such a fabulous bathroom, was not to our liking (actually, we do not like baths in our room in general - taking a bath and sleeping or reading in a room are two very different things and don't match energetically). Next time we'll ask a room without a bath in the room.
The bed quality is top.

Although this is a small boutique hotel the service and comfort come close to the grand 5 star palaces where we have stayed. Welcome, all service throughout our stay and goodbye are very friendly. You are contacted prior to arrival to be supported with anything you would need.

We recommend the hotel without doubt (if you are ok paying quite a substantial amount. The price per night is high, unfortunately, despite all the positive comments above. Paying around 2.000 EUR for a three night stay remains over the top, even in Barcelona in a luxurious boutique hotel).
",4,2017,05,15
18,Fabulous Property; even better staff,"The location is perfect, with walking distance to the beach, Gothic section, and, with a bit of effort, Gaudi's highlights. The property itself is sleek and tasteful. The restaurant is wonderful. What really makes this a premier hotel, though, is the staff. They were helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. We could not ask for more.",5,2017,05,12
18,Best guest relations ever,"The Serras has, hands down, the best guest-relations services we've experienced. This sleek, 30-room boutique hotel has a rooftop bar with spectacular views, a great restaurant and a hip vibe. But the real star is its staff, and its commitment to catering to guests. More than a month before we arrived, the concierge  managed to get us reservations at the hottest restaurant in town - Tickets, which is notoriously difficult to book. When we arrived at the hotel, we were given a glass of champagne and staff spent more than 20 minutes showing us through the hotel. They gave us a complimentary smartphone to use while we were in Barcelona, something we've never seen before overseas. We could phone home or use GPS and other Internet services on the street, conserving our own international data. Chocolates on the pillow? Too pedestrian. The Serras left out little pastries at night, each one prettier than the next. It's also perfectly located between the harbor and the Gothic Quarter,  away from the craziness of La Rambla but an easy walk to that popular stretch. 
How much were we impressed with the Serras? After a week in San Sabastian, we returned to Barcelona for one night at an airport hotel and had to take a cab to the Serras to enjoy the rooftop bar one more time before returning home.",5,2017,05,12
18,our  vacacation,When i come back there i will stay there again it was well worth it!!! we eat at there restaurant it was wonderful food and the staff is special everyone was so sweet from the door man and receptionist to  our nice waitress they helped us with where  ever we wanted to go gave us maps took time to circle the areas we should visit i give them A+,5,2017,05,11
18,Absolutely fantastic ,"Fantastic stay, beautiful rooms, comfy beds and terrific bathrooms, incredibly friendly staff, superb location. Faultless will definitely return. Very close to La Rambla, Gothic quarter and beach. Beautiful views from roof top bar too. ",5,2017,05,09
18,Worth a visit ,"We had a fantastic meal here in Restaurant Informal, the food was of a high standard and very good value. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. 
It has beautiful rooftop bar and pool area which is worth checking out!",5,2017,05,04
18,Que Serras Serras.....!,"This is an outstanding hotel...the location is perfect; the rooms, facilities, ambience decor are all very tasteful and stylish;  finally, but not least, and in my view the key ingredient, the staff are so helpful and knowledgeable....someone has taken a lot of time to train and select the right people.....well done.",5,2017,05,03
18,"Top location, top rooms and top personnel!","Located at a great spot at the marina, this small boutique hotel (about 35 rooms) offers luxury and comfort. The food is great, especially the breakfast is an enjoyment, the rooms are spacy, luxury and everything looks brand new. The rooftop terrace and bar is an excellent place to relax, and last but not least, the personnel, all of them without any exception, are superfriendly and helpful. Definitely worth our warmest recommendation!",5,2017,05,02
18,Luxury in a Convenient Spot,"We stayed here the night before a Mediterranean cruise. It is very conveniently located within walking distance to the marina. A bottle of sparkling wine was waiting for us when we arrived, as well as large bottles of water and an array of treats. A very nice welcome! The staff were all super helpful and friendly.

There was a coffee pot in the room, as well as comfy slippers and robes. The bathroom has a very modern look. We had plenty  of space and we didn't get the largest room. There was a couch and a chair so we had room to enjoy our snacks. 

We went up to the rooftop patio, which offers fabulous views of Barcelona. We brought our glasses of champagne up with us and no one had a problem with it.

They offered several suggestions for dinner. We chose one we could walk to at the marina. Honestly, I wouldn't go to that restaurant again. They weren't friendly, service was bad and the food was mediocre. I can't remember the name of it, but it is the one they recommend at the marina. I suggest you chose a different restaurant, even if you have to take a taxi. They didn't seem to want to mess with Americans, even though we had a reservation and did nothing rude. You can tell a lot from people's facial expressions.The hotel has their own  restaurant. We would have been better off going there.

Aside from that slight hiccup , we really enjoyed our stay. It is located only a couple of blocks from the metro. We used that to get around.

We had lunch at the top level of the art museum located near the dancing fountains. That was fabulous. Great food, views and service. You do need a reservation.

We will be coming back to Barcelona and when we do, we'll be staying at Hotel The Serras. The service, luxury of the room, and peaceful night stay, make it a must to visit in Barcelona.",5,2017,04,26
18,Incredible Hotel Experience!,"My husband and I just stayed at The Serras with our 2 children and were thrilled to discover such a gem.  The Serras is an amazing boutique hotel with lovely rooms, exceptional service and delicious food.  A few highlights:
•	Incredible guest service (the hotel helped with restaurant bookings, babysitting service and other requests in advance of our arrival)
•	Lovely, luxurious rooms with modern design:  loved the sheets, down pillows, all white rooms/beds, bathrooms with a shower that was easy to operate even on the first try (and large…which is not always the case in Europe), good towels, wood floors (feels cleaner than carpet), lounge area with candy jar (made our kids’ top 10 lists), good lighting
•	Breakfast:  among the best hotel breakfasts I’ve ever had anywhere – orange juice, fruit, bread basket, coffees --- all absolutely delicious
•	Service:  Warm, friendly staff who made you feel as if they really cared about your experience
•	Roof Deck:  What a lovely way to enjoy Barcelona and feel a little “away from the bustle”, pool up there was a huge hit with our kids!

I never write these reviews but felt that The Serras certainly merited it.  If I could have given more than 5 stars, I would have.",5,2017,04,18
18,Amazing hotel,A beautiful boutique hotel in a great location just a short walk to Las Ramblas. The hotel staff were very attentive & even supplied us with an umbrella one morning as rain threatened. We were given a personal show of the hotel before being shown to our room. Here we were greeted with a complimentary bottle of cava to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel also supplies a mobile phone free to use whilst there loaded with local information. The room was furnished to a high standard with a very comfy bed with maid service provided morning & evening. We could find no fault with the hotel & the stylish rooftop bar was perfect for cocktails & chilling after a long day sightseeing. Lastly the restaurant is definitely worth a visit too! Highly recommended hotel. ,5,2017,04,18
18,Top Notch Place,I stayed here with my daughter and felt very pampered. Definitely a boutique hotel with a lot of unique space to enjoy. My room had fruit and juice when i arrived. The rooms were decorated so nice. This hotel was in a great location because it was right across from the waterfront dock. It was also in the Gothic town so it was easy to walk and do sightseeing. The small restaurant inside has a one Michelin star so it is always an option! Our room had a little balcony outside the window that looked out onto the water and street below. They also had a phenomenal rooftop bar. Superb,5,2017,04,15
18,Based on 5 Stars I would give this 6,"My wife and I just stayed a week at The Serras and it is top shelf. The staff went above and beyond.  That includes the front desk, servers, greeters and the GM.  The facility was immaculate and the location could not be better.  

We have stayed at some great hotels including the Sanctuary at Kiawah Island and this hotel is as well run as it gets.  

A final note is that the hotel restaurant offered delicious food at a fair price. We ate some great meals in Barcelona and when we decided where to go for a repeat dinner on our last night we chose Informal (the hotel restaurant) as the food and staff were super. 

Well done Serras.  We hope to return!",5,2017,04,14
18,Best boutique hotel I've ever stayed at,"Family run boutique hotel in a perfect location.  The decor is modern and clean.  The lobby restaurant is excellent.  Roof top bar has incredible views, awesome cocktails and a pool.  The rooms are all designed with a modern  and chic feel and are spotless clean.  Good technology as well with smart phones for every guest that allow you to use internet and make calls without charge.

The people running the hotel are first class.  Comparing their service to mandarin, four seasons, etc.  I would choose the staff at the serras.  They treated us with warmth and friendliness that is hard to find at top notch properties.  Everything from organizing guides and tours, to making reservations at their excellent choices around Barcelona.  The manager was very present and his attention to detail and service resonated among the rest of the staff.

I would give the serras among the highest ratings of any place I have stayed at.  Absolutely top notch in every respect.

Complimenti!!!

18,Everything was excellent!,"I have nothing but good things to say about this place - everything was great. Check in was smooth with excellent service, my room was good, breakfast was beautiful. I would stay again!! I did not get the chance to try the pool.",5,2017,04,10
18,Wonderful stay at The Serras,"We recently spent 3 nights at The Serras. This was our second trip to Barcelona. Our last  visit we stayed on the beach, but preferred the location of The Serras which was right across the street from The Harbor. We were walking distance from virtually everywhere we wanted to go from shopping to restaurants and sightseeing.

The hotel itself is nicely designed and is a small boutique hotel with a great restaurant. What sets this hotel apart in my opinion is the great service you receive from the staff. From the moment we arrived, they were extremely accomodating and helpful. Helping with reservations, futbol tickets, directions, transportation. 

We will definitely be back",5,2017,04,09
18,Spectacular and Cosy Boutique Hotel in Gothic Quarter,"My wife and I spent 9 nights in this cosy hotel on the edge of the gothic quarter and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We booked the Suite Mediterraneo, which comprised two adjoining rooms (501 and 502) connecting via a private corridor in a modern style setup with a good amount of room.  Room 501 had a king bed and fully appointed bathroom and a bathtub in the room, while 502 had a sofa bed and another bathroom with shower.  Was great for us, but would also be good for two couples traveling, or a family with up to a couple of teenagers.

The first night, I was snackish after checkin at 10pm and headed down to the restaurant, Informal, in the lobby.  A well deserved one Michelin star, the food was phenomenal as was sitting at a stool in front of the open kitchen, watching fresh octopus, fresh morels with cream sauce and fois gras, and other delightful portions being prepared with fun and love by the chef and his team.  We ended up eating at Informal for all of our breakfasts (included in our room rate) and several more times for dinner during our stay.  All servers --- but especially Anna --- were great in the morning, and Daniel, the Maitre D, was very helpful both at our dinners in pointing out the best new items in the menu and in suggesting a road trip to the Priorat Wine region, which we jumped at.

The 2 hour each way road trip to Priorat was orchestrated by the great concierge team, who also helped us both before and during the trip with dinner reservations.  Suggestion: book the best restaurants via the concierge two months in advance to have a chance to get seats (e.g. Bodega 1900, Tickets, and our personal favorite of the trip Disfrutar - which blew our minds with the 30 course tasting menu).  Elena was the star of the concierge team, seemingly effortlessly arranging visits to two top wineries as well as a great local lunch during our Priorat trip.

All of the staff during our stay were very friendly and accommodating, except perhaps the folks at the rooftop lounge who seemed a little harried, not as friendly, and quite slow at the service game.  That said, on a sunny day get up to the rooftop by 3:30pm on Sundays and be treated to a great scene with a DJ and a fun place to people watch.

Finally: bring your walking shoes.  Every major attraction it seemed was within an hours easy walk from the hotel.  From the beach at Barceloneta (quiet on weekdays but crazy busy with outdoor markets on the weekend) to the Sagrada Familia to Las Ramblas and even the Eixample district, everything seemed easily walkable from the hotel location.  And if you had to take a cab they were simple to hail from anywhere and both reasonable (10 euros) and quick (less than 15 minutes) to get to pretty much any of the sights or back to the centrally located hotel.

Thank you to the hotel and team for an exceptional stay.  We hope to come back again soon!",5,2017,04,07
18,Wonderful stay!!!,"This is a fabulous boutique hotel in a great location , in walking distance to the Gothic quarter and an abundance of restaurants , bars and shops ! The rooms are modern and clean with coffee machines and fabulous big showers !!
  The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and we were welcomed back each day by two charming young men , Diego and Sergio who couldn't do enough to make us feel at home ! They even fetched candy from the hotel's secret jar for my four year old daughter who thought they were great !!
    Jan was also very knowledgeable and helpful on the front desk , making dinner reservations for us and giving advice on the local area !
     The beach is only a ten minute walk away , as is the harbour where there are plenty of places to eat with a water view.
       We are coming back to The Serras in the summer as we need a second trip to this lovely place - a week just wasn't long enough !!!!!",5,2017,04,06
18,Stunning hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"This is the first time ever I write a recommendation but: What a great experience we had at THE SERRAS!!! My BFF and I spent a girls weekend at the hotel and already at the arrival we were amazed by the lovely and attentive service personnel. The room was fantastic with all the amenities you could ask for and especially the very warm welcome of the hotel manager - a bottle of cava and some delicious chocolate- made us feel very welcome and special.
The staff has been very attentive and helpful with everything- especially Sergio.
All their recommendations have been extraordinary and also breakfast at Informal has been fantastic.
We will be back- x sure!",5,2017,04,05
18,Fantastic Hotel Perfect for Exploring Barcelona,"The Serras hotel is an absolutely fantastic hotel located overlooking Port Vell on the edge of the Old Town and within easy walking distance of La Ramblas.  The room was beautifully fitted out and had a lovely balcony overlooking the Port, the roof top bar was great for a drink at the end of a hard day sightseeing, the restaurant ""Informal"" served fantastic food but it was the friendliness and professionalism of the staff that really stood out making the visit to Barcelona truly memorable.",5,2017,04,05
18,Five nights in Barcelona,"Absolutely gorgeous boutique hotel.  Staff couldn't be more helpful, the rooms are large and well appointed.  The beds are out of this world..for the first time in my life I slept really well on holiday!  The rooftop terrace is a great bonus for relaxing with a bottle of cava!",5,2017,04,04
18,Nice boutique hotel located near the water and El Born,"Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. We booked the junior suite. This looks right out onto Passeig de Colon, however the windows were very soundproof and we had no issues with noise despite the fact that it is a very busy street.

The location could not be better. It is an easy walk to the marina and beach. It is situated between one of the most remarkable cathedrals in Barcelona, Santa Maria del Mar, and  the Basílica de la Mercè. There are many great restaurants and shops in nearby El Born.

The room was comfortable. Freestanding tub at the far end of the bathroom was a nice indulgence. I only have two small complaints here. First, the free internet was awful. If constantly cut out and made booking future reservations incredibly frustrating. I would have gladly paid for a decent connection and reasonable bandwidth. Second, we had one morning with not very hot water. Otherwise, the room was excellent.

Breakfast in the downstairs restaurant lounge was delicious and convenient. The rooftop lounge was also a nice place to relax after a day or evening out.",4,2017,04,04
18,Couldn't Ask for Anything Nicer,"First, our room was delightful, with a modern bathroom filled with deluxe features. The housekeeping staff kept the room in pristine condition and kept the bathroom well stocked with clean towels, toilet paper, soap, etc.. We asked for a room that would be relatively free of street noise; I never heard any throughout our stay. One especially nice feature is that the room comes with a free cell phone that has many apps and also allows free calls to the U. S.. It does not allow sending and receiving either email or texts, so I paid AT&T for a few days of international service. It happened that AT&T failed to activate this service, but I was able to use the room cell phone to call AT&T and have the problem corrected. I routinely used the Google Maps app on the hotel cell phone to navigate while walking.
Second, the location of the hotel is perfect. It is at the edge of the Barri Gotic and a few blocks from El Born. These are the old sections of Barcelona in which I liked to stroll. In the newer sections of Barcelona there are lovely modern areas with wide avenues, but they are too similar to similar streets in America to have great appeal to me. Also, the hotel is a short walk from the Barcelonetta, where we went one night for dinner.
Third, and MOST IMPORTANT, the staff of the hotel was as pleasant and helpful as any I have ever encountered. We relied on them for suggestions where to dine and to make reservations. We ate one meal at the hotel restaurant, Informal. It turned out to be best we had in Barcelona, but in all honesty most nights we went to Tapas bars. The hotel staff also recommended a tour company with which we were very satisfied. 
In summary, I would strongly recommend to any friends visiting Barcelona that the stay at the Serras.",5,2017,03,30
18,Maybe slightly unlucky !!,"This is a great hotel, in a brilliant position, though in the 3 nights that we stayed it could have been better.   We booked a 5 star hotel for all its amenities.  Though having arrived on a Sunday after 7 hours travelling, we thought it would be good to recover at the rooftop bar, long chairs etc.  But we found that since this area is open to the general public all the chairs were taken.  We went up again on the Monday, and started a conversation with a family sitting near us.  They said they always stayed at a B & B nearby but used the bar, pool and long chairs of the Serras.  I feel that as this is a small  area it should only be available on the room key.
On our 3rd day after a long day sight seeing we arrived back at the hotel at 5.30 and found that our room had not been serviced, so had to wait in the reception area until 6.00pm.  I pointed out that it says rooms are available from 2.00pm, and that we shouldn't be expected to check out each day, and then check back in again so that the rooms are ready.  The manager was very apologetic and took a percentage of the room rate from our bill.
I wouldn't let these issues put you off staying at the Serras, but for us it was a long way to travel and not quite perfect.",4,2017,03,30
18,Lovely hotel and great service ,"We spent 2 nights at this lovely boutique hotel close to the shore in the Gothic district of Barcelona.  The hotel was very attentive sending emails prior to our arrival asking whether we needed to be picked up at the airport or if we were celebrating a special occasion.  On arrival we were offered a drink, shown the amenities of the hotel and provided with tips about what to see and do.  The bed was very comfortable and the sheets were divine!  Water bottles and a lovely snack were in the room for us.  The hotel room had its own cell phone we could call from and use for sightseeing and restaurant info.  It was a new perk and there were a few glitches but we were very impressed!   We returned to Barcelona at the end of our trip and would have stayed at the Serras again but unfortunately the only room available was bigger and more expensive.  We travel a lot and rank this hotel is one of our favorites.",5,2017,03,29
18,Fabtastic location wonderful views from the roof terrace,"A most enjoyable weekend break. The staff were super helpful and very informed about the area - nothing was too much trouble. Hotel beautifully designed, making good use of space in a great location.  Our Junior Suite, although quite small, was very well thought out to give a feeling of space and luxurious bathrooms (again beautifully designed).  Great roof terrace to sit and watch the boats in the marina beyond.  Would highly recommend.",5,2017,03,29
18,appealing,let me just start by saying this is such a beautiful high end hotel for an amazing price. the staff was very friendly to me. the outdoor scenery was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen. the rooms were spot clean everyday. i recommend this hotel.,5,2017,03,29
18,Best hotel in Barca!,"Every thing about this hotel is what you would expect from a 5* hotel.

From the moment you arrive, you are greeted with a hot towel to freshen up and a choice of cava, water or orange juice!

You are given a tour of the hotel to be shown the facilities at the hotel and the great rooftop bar and pool.

Wifi available throughout the hotel.

The rooms are beautifully clean and comfortable. Tapas/fruit waiting for you inthe room on arrival, Hynos beds,rainfall showers and the BEST THING OF ANY HOTEL IVE EVER STAYED IN: each room comes with a smart phone that you can use and take around Barcelona with you! This became a life saver as it has defaulted suggestions of local places to visit, eat and tips for getting around Barcelona. You can also download any new apps you wish to. 

This phone was a god send as there were no limits on how much data you can use  so we took it with us every where and used it for google maps etc. 

You can also call home (back to the UK for us) for no added cost.

The staff were amazing! One night we were kept up by a baby crying throughout the night and the next day we were moved to another room and although I initially felt awkward for raising the issue (we were staying for 5 nights so couldnt go that long without a full night's sleep) the staff were completely understanding.

I also turned 30 whilst in Barca and we came back to our room to find a bottle of cava and a cake waiting for us - a lovely treat that was totally unexpected and not requested by my partner. 

Interesting fact - this was the first studio for Picasso which has now been turned into a boutique hotel!",5,2017,03,29
18,Don't look anywhere else,"This boutique hotel in Barcelona is the best hotel my partner and I have stayed at. We felt welcomed from the moment we entered the hotel. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly, the rooms were spacious and very clean (not to mention well designed with quality finishes), the turn down service was lovely! We could not have asked for more. Thank you to the team at Hotel The Serras for making us feel welcomed and special!",5,2017,03,26
18,"Fantastic hotel, superb restaurant and amazing customer service",Stayed here for a short break in early March.  Located in the old quarter so perfect for wandering the streets and browsing the shops. Ate in the restaurant a couple of times and food was superb.  The staff are great and the customer service is some of the best that I have experienced.  Could not recommend this hotel and restaurant more highly.,5,2017,03,25
18,We were sad to leave...,"Everything about Barcelona was wonderful, comfortable, fun, and friendly.  Our stay at The Serras made certain of it.  Our rooms were comfortable and well-appointed, and every aspect addressed all our senses.  We were traveling as a family with two teenagers, and the staff was unfailingly cheerful and enthusiastic in helping us plan fun days and good meals.  Dinner at their restaurant was one of our favorite meals and cocktails on the roof were cozy and fun, even with chilly evenings. The managers personally introduced themselves to us and emphasized how important it is to them that their small hotel (only 28 rooms) ensures that every guest feels well taken care of.  Mission accomplished.
We all felt sad as they helped us into our taxi to the train station, smiling and waving like we were old friends. 
Now all we have to do is figure out when we can go back.",5,2017,03,25
18,Outstanding From Start to Finish,"From the moment I walked through the door I knew my birthday trip was in good hands! I was offered a glass of Cava during check-in and shown to my room. I'd booked a ""Standard Room"" via the website. Though it's the smallest room available (I was traveling solo!) it was still amazingly chic, comfortable, and perfect. The staff even had a bottle of Cava and a birthday treat waiting in the room for me, which was a wonderful surprise. 

Keep in mind, the Standard Rooms don't have a view - which I was aware of when booking - but it still had a charming little terrace. I'd advise keeping the linen drapes drawn, which still lets in the light but prevents neighbors across the way from peering in. I was also closest to the busy street, which was fine (the noise was very minimal with the terrace doors closed). If you're noise-sensitive, though, I'd suggest earplugs or an upgrade. 

The hotel staff was impeccably attentive and friendly. The hotel restaurant was delicious. Room service was perfectly on time for breakfast. Rooftop bar was amazing, especially the Patron Margarita (double wow!!). 

Being a solo female traveler, I was happy to find that the hotel was in a safe location and walking distance to practically everything! There are also several little convenient stores within a few blocks, which were perfect for grabbing bottles of water or little snacks.

In every way, this hotel lived up to its reputation and I can't thank them enough for such a beautiful stay!",5,2017,03,20
18,Beautiful boutique hotel in Barcelona,My family and I stayed in this beautiful boutique hotel in Barcelona for a long weekend. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and efficient throughout our stay. The rooms were very comfortable and spotless. We did not eat in the main restaurant but the bar meals were lovely,5,2017,03,19

18,6 stars out of 5 for attention to detail,"This was really one of the best places we've ever stayed. I was worried in making my booking that no accommodation here could be worth the prices, however, the level of attention to detail and service here defined luxury for me for a european hotel. We were greeted very well, with champagne, they made reservations for us at Sagrada Familia for the next day, and for dinner that night at Llamber. The hotel is fantastic - on the tour they told us Picasso had once had a studio where the bar and pool area are. The room was very luxurious, the bed, the sheets, the products, the turndown cupcakes and water. We loved having the balcony to the side street. It was totally quiet and isolated. The staff were very helpful. Bfast was delicious with fresh eggs that had bright orange yolks. All in all a luxurious and much more nuanced approach to the attention to detail that really sets them apart. One thing that really set them apart as intl travelers is that they gave us a handy cell phone to use which had maps, browser, really all that we needed to make it easy to get around and find what we need. I wish more places offered that. We felt exceptionally and personally taken care of. I think at this price point they must be beating out their competitors, and we wish them luck in their service endeavors.",5,2017,03,09
18,Amazing hotel,"What an amazing experience - all the details of the hotel beautiful, a definite too stay again. 
Roof top terrace and bar a real plus ... and the handy in your room such a brilliant idea. Want to redecorate house now! ",5,2017,03,07
18,One Hotel I Will Always Remember,"This was my first trip to Barcelona and as much as its a beautiful city. I have to say that this hotel has made a difference in making a beautiful city feel like home. Many trips are all about enjoying the city and you come back to a good hotel. The best thing here is when you are in a boutique hotel every one has what sets it apart. Here this hotel is all perfect. I look forward to coming back and staying in my room. The rooms are a very comfortable size, very clean and modern topped with staff that make this place even more home like. They are all with no exception the nicest team together. I don't know how they can do it but everyone goes beyond their way to make you feel like you are appreciated. It starts from the time you walk in to check in you are greeted in a very courteous manner and escorted to your room where everything is explained. They provide you with a mobile phone in your room to use in the city with unlimited data called ""handy"" to the mattresses and pillow that make you sink into one of the most comfortable and quiet nights. Wake up in the morning for breakfast and the staff there will go beyond to cater to any requests. I have come after the breakfast time and they were there waiting and did not make it like they were doing me a favor. They go over and beyond to make sure that everything is right. The nice thing is they remember exactly how you like your coffee every day. The view from the rooftop is stunning anytime of the day. I do not think that this hotel can be topped and I am definitely coming back. I have seen boutique hotels but they are not The Serras.",5,2017,03,03
18,Simply Amazing Beautiful hotel exceptional service stunning views full package THE BEST IN BARCA,Planning a trip to Barca for my fiance's birthday last year I wanted a perfect location in gothika quarter with 5 star reviews in food service with a boutique feel to the hotel my god did this hotel fit the bill from the minute we walked through the hotel door the staff where simply amazing they couldn't do enough for us shared this amazing trip with another family and we had the most amazing time!

18,Luxury Boutique Hotel,"My family and I just got back from a wonderful stay at the hotel.  From the moment we arrived the staff was extremely helpful, friendly, and welcoming - especially to our 3 young daughters. As others have mentioned, we were greeted with a glass of Cava and juice for our girls.  When we arrived back after exploring we had a bottle of Cava and a plate of meats, cheeses, and sweets waiting for us in our room. They also left a special gift for our daughters, and a bowl of sweets.  They assisted us in setting up tours, dinners, and a special birthday breakfast for our youngest daughter. Our suite was extremely spacious, comfortable, and clean with a great view of the marina. The breakfast at the restaurant was delicious and plentiful, and our dinner at Informal was one of our best.  The hotel's location is ideal with the ability to explore a lot of Barcelona on foot. We absolutely loved our stay, and cannot say enough about the hospitality we received. Our daughters are still talking about the hotel and the lovely staff. It was beyond our expectations. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2017,03,02
18,Beautiful stay in Barcelona,"We arrived late in the evening from Italy and were simply looking to get some sleep. The welcome we received upon our arrival was amazing.  The staff was friendly  and helpful and made us feel like they'd been waiting all day for us to arrive.  We received a quick tour of the lovely hotel and were shown to our rooms.  A wonderful cheese and meats tray as well as a bottle of champagne and chocolates were waiting for us.  We stayed up, opened the window and had a little party to welcome ourselves to Barcelona.   

The rooftop pool is perfect on a hot day- lots of room to sit, great food and drinks and an attentive staff overlooking the beach and ocean. 

A quick walk away and you are transported from the more modern beachfront area to quaint winding streets and old architecture  as well as tons of shopping and dining establishments. 

I'd highly recommend  Hotel The Serras to anyone visiting Barcelona.",4,2017,03,01
18,Recommend Hotel The Serras!,"Loved our stay at Hotel The Serras.  The room was great, the location was great and the roof top bar was so cool!  The people who work at the front desk were so customer-service oriented. We got in really late at night and they greeted us at our cab and made us feel so welcomed that it didn't even feel like the middle of the night.  Highly recommend.",5,2017,02,28
18,Amazing roof top bar and hotel styling,"I want my house to look like this hotel. Gorgeous styling with all things carefully considered. There are plenty of places to chill out either the library on the second floor with some gorgeous architecture books to read, the roof top bar or even the reception lounge its so pretty. The staff where incredibly helpful in helping us book restaurants and find our way around as well as giving us a tour of the hotel.

we had drinks on the roof top bar each night and they had heaters set up so we could enjoy the view. Drinks where really strong so one was enough for us light weights!

Rooms are gorgeous with a welcome plate of local food to greet us as we arrived. Had a really good nights sleep and the room was super quite with double glazed windows. This is where I am staying when I come back to Barcelona.",5,2017,02,27
18,Boutique luxury in Barcelona!,"Staying for a short family break in Barcelona we could not have chosen a more friendly,stylish and well located hotel. As a small luxury boutique hotel it delivers a really top class service - all the staff were friendly,attentive and really made us feel at home...with some nice touches...plenty of Cava!...that made us feel very special! The hotel is located in an ideal position for exploring the sights - city centre,gothic quarter,marina and beach area - by foot. The rooms were stylish,clean and smart...with very effective soundproof glazing on the balcony windows ensuring a great nights rest. We all loved the rooftop terrace with its pool and a bar...the views over the marina in the evening are magnificent! A particular mention also,for the 'The Handy'....a mobile phone to take out with you on your travels during your stay,providing internet access and national/international calls...at no extra cost! A great idea,which we found really useful. Simply put,a wonderful hotel,with a real wow factor!...I have no hesitation in recommending!",5,2017,02,26
18,Short break - site seeing,"Superb team in the hotel, very friendly and very helpful, 
Room was great, also security to room made you fell safe.
Restaurant had a superb meal during our stay.
Great location for very thing to do in Barcelona.
Have recommended The Serras to work colleagues who are thinking of going to Barcelona.
Thanks for making our stay in Barcelona a great one.
Gary",5,2017,02,23
18,Amazing Hotel,"The staff at this hotel are simply fantastic. The Cava laden arrival and welcome set the scene for a very enjoyable stay.

The bed was so comfortable we are trying to buy a similar mattress in the UK. The Serras staff are so helpful they have even offered to supply one of their mattresses to the UK!

Although this hotel is away from the centre of the city we found this better as the gothic quarter was where we found most interesting. The Segrada was still only a 35 minute walk away.

We would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona provided it is within your price range. Definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed in, anywhere.",5,2017,02,22
18,Boutique Luxury,"This small 5 star hotel on the edge of the Gothic Quarter on the waterfront is an excellent alternative to one of the larger chains.    The service is perfect.   They called us the day of our arrival to ask if we needed any additional information or help.  When we arrived they offered drinks and snacks while checking in, valeted the car, and spent about 20 minutes with an orientation of the hotel and city.   Our room was their smallest but wonderfully designed and appointed.    With quadruple glazing there was absolutely no street noise.     The bed might be the best we have ever experienced in a hotel, and bedding was top quality.    Internet was fast, the rooms storage good, and turn down service included fresh bottles of water and a small sweet every evening.   Location is great right on the edge of the Gothic Quater and with a waterfront view.  The breakfast was very good and the bar was 24 hours a day.  The gym was small but the rooftop bar was nice size and had great harbor views.  I only have two small caveats:  no cotton balls or qtips in the bathroom for women's makeup, and the shower only had a rain head and hand held and the latter attached at waist level so if you prefer a regular shower had, you don't get one.    We would definitely go back and recommend this hotel to our friends.",5,2017,02,21
18,The Serras,"The facilities at The Serras were brilliant, the roof terrace and views alone made it an amazing holiday. The staff were all so helpful, informative and friendly, making a point of always chatting with our son and leaving a gift on his bed on the first night which he was so thrilled about. We cannot praise The Serras highly enough, we loved every minute and would love to return. ",5,2017,02,20
18,Best hotel.,"I agree with all comments made about this hotel. Over the years we have stopped at many hotels all over the World, and this one would be one of the best we have ever stayed at. This is mostly due to the service and excellent restaurant. All of the staff are lovely and will do anything to help you. ",5,2017,02,19
18,City break with the kids,"I booked a three night stay recently based on the other reviews I had read here and The Serras really delivered.

It's a beautifully designed hotel but its all about the service.  Every member of staff, from the moment we checked in, during dinner, drinks on the roof and even waving us goodbye as we left were friendly, courteous and professional.  All the staff struck the perfect balance with us.  That said the hotel rooms are excellent, the food delicious and the location perfect.  

If you're looking for ""family friendly"" in the sense of kids menus, ball pits etc then this isn't it.  But every member of staff made my kids feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble - they even put Barcelona footballs in the room as a welcome gift - great touch.  The Serras is a grown up hotel in a great part of town that offers a very warm welcome to families too - we loved it.",5,2017,02,16
18,"Great staff, great location","We enjoyed two days at the Serras.  The entire staff, form the manager to the porter, was helpful, knowledgable and personable.  We got help with dining reservations and advice on things to do.  Our room was clean and comfortable and the complimentary cellphone with GPS and free phone service was a nice addition.  The roof terrace was a great way to end the day.",5,2017,02,14
18,"Outstanding level of service, beautiful hotel","We would like to thank the Serras Hotel for all their generosity during our visit. They are the loveliest staff and we cannot thank them enough. Upon entering it was the most welcoming entrance we have ever had. Even though we had a baby, and a grumpy small child, the staff were so courteous and friendly,and so generous. Thank you to the main manager, Elisabet, and Juan. We are most grateful.

Check in was seated down with refreshments. Quick and easy.The room was immaculate and the housekeeping staff friendly, and would leave little treats for us each evening.
The shower, the bed, the nespresso machine, kettle, complimentary water, big bright bathroom mirror, bath, the decor - it was all outstanding.

There is a small gym which I loved, with weights, running machine, tv, and pilates ball. The roof top pool bar is stunning, lovely views over the marina. 

The location is perfect. Behind the hotel narrow streets lead you to the Gothic quarter, and there are plenty of supermarkets, great for us as we needed milk for our baby. There are also plenty of coffee shops nearby, for grabbing a pastry and coffee. I loved the Gothic quarter and there are many good unique little shops. Barcelona has great chocolate shops too. Alternatively cross the main road and follow the harbour round to the beach. There is a nice little cafe there in the square close to the beach, where I eat with my children, pasta, and juices. Lots of pharmacies in Barcelona, which with children is comforting. We walked everywhere, and most of the attractions are walkable. There is a large police presence in the city, which made the city feel safe. We were careful with our belongings when we were walking the city, and luckily we did not experience anything other than friendly lovely people.

We just loved the Serras so much, stunning hotel, and Barcelona itself, we are already hoping to go back in the summer!!!! Thank you all!",5,2017,02,14
18,All about service,Stayed the first weekend in February and had without doubt the best service experience ever. Anything you can think of this hotel has thought of it already. Friendly attitude of the reception staff on check in with a glass of cava. Excellent margaritas on the roof served by wonderful bar staff and super service in Informal on the Saturday night of our visit all added up to the most amazing weekend away. If we visit Barcelona again we won't be staying anywhere else. ,5,2017,02,13
18,"Perfect location, gracious service","Right on the edge of the Gothic quarter.  We could walk right out our door and be in el Barri Gotic and easily walk to El Born neighborhoods.  This was wonderful.  Restaurants and bars all around.  We arrived jet lagged and had asked for an early check in and were surprised that they so easily obliged.  They really went out of their way to be certain we were pleased with everything. Check in was smooth.  The room is contemporary, sleek with glass and mirrors. Immaculately clean.  Our 5th floor balcony was over an alley and had a view of the mediterranean.  I have never been a hotel that was so quiet at night.  That was delightful.  We ate at La Informal on a Sunday night.  That was really nice as well.  Hats off to the staff.  Wonderful stay.  We would happily return. Only detractor would be the tiny gym. But we really got our exercise walking the city.",5,2017,02,13
18,Amazing hotel,"My wife and I have just returned from a weekend at The Serras. Wow, what a fantastic hotel. This is without doubt the best hotel we have stayed at. Absolutely every tiny detail has been considered. The staff are fantastic the food is amazing and the location is perfect. Hopefully we will have the opportunity to visit again very soon",5,2017,02,13
18,Amazing Stay!,"We don't think we could say enough about the Serras. It was our first visit to Barcelona and the Serras made it perfect. First of all, the staff was the best we've ever encountered. They could not have been more helpful, courteous, kind or friendly. From management, to the front desk, to the door men, to the restaurant/bar staff, to housekeeping; I give them all 5 stars!! 

The room was impeccable. Clean and modern. And I want the bed! After all, if Buckingham PLace sleeps on those mattresses!!!

We have never felt so pampered or so welcome. Thank you Antonio and staff. We will be back!",5,2017,02,12
18,One of the best hotels ,"We have stayed in many hotels over the years - five star and others and this is just simply one of the very best - ever 
The location is perfect you are in front of the gothic quarter which has loads of good restaurants and bars and shops and things to do and facing the port which just happened to have the world largest private yachts in during our visit !
It is a great location to walk from - The Rambles is to one side with its great food market - la boqueria which is a must visit the lunch at one of the seafood cafes on the corners of the market was the best ever - you have easy walking access to Segrada Familia, the Cathedral , Picasso Museum etc etc 
And in front you have the marina and the beach which is fun to walk along even in the colder months. 
The hotel itself is beautiful inside and out - fantastic roof terrace with small pool cocktail bar and heaters!
Great and relaxing bar on the first floor good meeting spot - we met some lovely folks from the USA one night - above the first class restaurant which delivered the best meal we had in Barcelona 
Recommend you include breakfast in your rate they run until 11am and the food choices are excellent  
We booked a junior suite which was quite big and very well kitted out. We thought the bath in the lounge area was a bit over the top until we used it every day after our long walks to chill with a glass of cava !
The staff were lovely we could mention them all - they were that good but special mention to Susana in reservations and Claudia in the restaurant for making our stay very special. 
We used the hotel arranged car for arrival and a taxi for departure.  Taxis are cheap and clean

Good and very reasonable jazz club Harlem five minutes away highly recommended but only kicks off at 10:30 pm ",5,2017,02,12
18,Best Short Break Ever,"My wife and I stayed at this wonderful hotel for a long weekend at the end of January. We had a welcome email before we arrived asking for any dietary issues and any transfers. Also a phone call two days before just to confirm if there was anything that could be provided in advance of our arrival. As soon as we arrived we were welcomed with a glass of Cava and Diego the Reception Manager made us very welcome and recommended all the best restaurants and sites to see. They'll even book them for you if you wish. We used his recommendations and they were fantastic. The concierge also were brilliant and couldn't do enough for us, in particular Daniel. The hotel restaurant was first class and in particular the sommelier. Listen to his recommendations - he is so good and an absolute gentleman. 
This was an early anniversary get away so as this was mentioned, a complimentary bottle of Cava and nibbles were a nice surprise in our room. 
If you go to Barcelona stay here for sure.
We will definitely be going back. Loved it !! ",5,2017,02,10
18,Classy & Well Located - Gothic Quarter,"Couldn't have started a European trip any better.  This is a small property right on the edge of the Gothic Quarter - the heart of Roman and medieval Barcelona. The service and hospitality was special with all staff making a point to remember you.  While not inexpensive, it was truly a great value.  The property is very clean and modern juxtaposition the Gothic Quarter.",5,2017,02,09
18,Amazing Hotel! Incredible personal service..,"We booked this hotel based on the incredibly positive feedback from other reviewers and were not disappointed at all. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. It's those little touches that make all the difference, prosecco and hot towels on arrival, a tour of the hotel before being shown to your room, rushing to open and close the door for you on entry or departure. There was fresh bottles of water in the room each evening and a very discreet turn down service...even an umbrella in the room should there be the odd shower. Despite having a first class restaurant in the hotel there was no problem offering to book reservations elsewhere.

The rooftop bar was so beautiful, I could have spent the entire weekend watching the world go by from up there! Even in a slightly chilly February they offer blankets and portable gas flamed heaters that really do make it all feel very special.

I was sorry to leave and can't wait to return.",5,2017,02,06
18,Best hotel in Barcelona 100%!!!!,"Guys,come and stay in this hotel,you will never regret !! I have been staying here over a week because it was my special 30 birthday and I was very happy that my Hubby choose this hotel.First of all,the hotel is syper clean;staff is helpful as possible.They will recommend you top restaurants,safe areas to visit.Listen to them. Restaurant inside of the hotel offers you very tasty dinners and breakfast.Nice selections of 🍷 wine.My favourite octopus,baby goat meat ,steak and of course Iberian ham.Very safe hotel ,you don't need to worry about leaving your expensive staff there.Rooftop is really relaxing...with the nice view. Every night we got some nice desert and bottle of water in our room,very thoughtful!! Especially thank you ,Antonio Bignone (general manager) and all his staff for making my stay even more special!! Thank you guys!! Olga and Darek",5,2017,02,05
18,Home in Barcelona,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at the Serras! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was outstanding with lots of healthy choices! Location is perfect for a great run in the morning as well as for excursions in the city. After a long day walking through Barcelona's streets we enjoyed a drink at the roof top bar. Modern, sophisticated but cozy Interieur. Great boutique hotel with attention to detail and outstanding service.",5,2017,02,04
18,All true,"This is one fabulous hotel. Was it our first time, yes, was it our last time, definitely not.I will not add anymore to the already great comments except to say they are all true so go there and enjoy.",5,2017,01,31
18,This may be the BEST hotel experience ... ever.,"My scale is based on location, quality of service, amenities and staff.  I prefer boutique hotels so some who read this may prefer the large Americanized spots and that's OK but this 28 room spot that makes you feel like welcomed family is perfect for me.  From their welcome ... at the curb, exiting our hire car ... to the level of assistance for ANY question or need, to the dining experience is beyond reproach.  
Tip1 - the rooms that end in ""02"" (302, 402, etc) are on a corner and have the best light and at the front of the hotel.
Tip2 - breakfast is a bit pricy - it's good but more than most require - but there are several  local establishments just one street behind.
Tip3 - the room is quite comfortable but lacks in unpacking storage (drawers) but the hanging space is fine - and the beds are fantastic ... then the pillows too
Tip4 - the staff makes every attempt at remembering your name and I tried to return their grace by remembering theirs.

Enjoy.",5,2017,01,29
18,Good things come in small packages,"There are a lot of choice in Barcelona.  We stayed for 10 days and the hotel proved to be in an excellent location for getting to a variety of places.  Although we had a street facing suite, the traffic noise was not a problem as the glazing is excellent. It is lovely waking up to the morning sun. The rooftop bar is also great for evening cocktails and sunset watching. Pool is really a plunge pool only.  Not a problem in the winter.  Staff were generally very good.  The suite ( like must in Barcelona was relatively cozy) 4.5 stars. The Sommelier was great.",4,2017,01,26
18,Memorable Honeymoon,"My wife and I went there for our honeymoon. Their staff were the best thing about the place. The location is perfect, you can walk to the best places in Barcelona from there.
The hotel is very cozy with a limited number of rooms available which made our experience more special. We'll be back for our next visit to Barcelona",5,2017,01,24
18,No doubt this should be no.1 in Spain.,"What a fantastic hotel, I would love to wax lyrical for thousands of characters but I will keep it in bullet form as I find that most helpful. Bottom line is: BOOK NOW! You won't regret it. Absolutely dreamy. 

-Service: This was most certainly the highlight of the stay. Beyond the usual ""no request was denied."" the welcome was warm, the staff went out of their way to help us at every turn. Sergio even remembered our names! We stayed for a night and then left to Granada returning for another two nights. The hotel REMEMBERED our requests regarding toiletries from the first stay and ensured the return was absolutely seamless. Best service I have received in Europe. 

-Accomodation: We booked the junior suite and on our return got upgraded to the junior suite with an ocean view. In the future, this is the room we will book. I loved the clean modern lines of the room, the linen and mattress was amazing and the bathroom absolutely up to standard. The communal areas were similarly new, tastefully furnished and an absolute delight. 

-Location: Perfectly located within walking distance of metros, the all important La Rambla avenue, the Gothic Quarter and of course all the amazing little restaurants and shops.",5,2017,01,23
18,Outstanding ,"This is an outstanding boutique hotel. Great location overlooking the harbour, within walking distance of all the major tourist attractions and the beach.
Exceptional service from every member of staff.
Relaxed restaurant with beautiful food - a great place to kick back and watch the world go by, or watch the kitchen team in action.
Lovely breakfasts with attentive service from a cheerful restaurant team.
The beds are comfortable and our room was quiet, with a fabulous bath and shower.
Great terrace plunge pool and relaxation area.
The bar on the mezzanine first floor is comfortable and feels almost attached to the restaurant - a great place for a pre or post dinner drink, with a great selection of gins.
A great concept excellently executed. Can't see any point in staying anywhere else in Barcelona!",5,2017,01,22
18,I wouldn't stay anywhere else! Service above and beyond.,"Our fabulous stay at the Serras began several weeks in advance of our stay, where the hotel courteously reached out and volunteered to assist with restaurant reservations, airport transfer, and tours.  They were able to recommend a number of things for our itinerary.  When we arrived, the incredible service continued - for example, when we checked in, someone immediately offered us glasses of cava, sat down with us and went through all of the attractions that we shouldn't miss; when we asked for a recommendation for drinks, they gave us several fabulous recs - including for a speakeasy that ranked as one of our favorite spots in Barcelona; etc.  It wasn't just the recommendations that made it unique, it was the level of eagerness to please and added detail that came along with the assistance - truly unmatched by other comparable boutique properties.  Other pros - the rooms are immaculate, modern, sleek, and extremely comfortable (lovely terrace, extremely comfortable bed); there was complimentary turn-down service each night with a miniature pastry; free nespresso and a welcome note with Spanish snacks; a tiny but sufficient gym; a lovely, heated roofdeck with blankets, which made it perfect for a nightcap; an elegant study/bar area on the second floor with artisanal cocktails; and a PERFECT location, in between the cathedral and the beach - right at the cusp of the Gothic Quarter (everything within walking distance).  This hotel is fabulous and doing everything right.  Sidenote - do NOT miss the restaurant for dinner!!!!",5,2017,01,17
18,Best hotel I've ever stayed at,"I'm so spoiled now.  This hotel.  Wow.  My favorite thing about it was probably the employees.  The gentleman who carried our bags in for us and who poured us champagne upon arrival was just the sweetest man.  He also arranged for an early morning cab for us for our departure, instructed us on the metro system, gave directions to restaurants, etc.  The woman who checked us in was also wonderful.  She arranged for reservations at restaurants, gave us a tour of the hotel, helped us purchase advance tickets for our activities, gave us tips on getting around in the city.  Once we got to our room, there was a plate of the tastiest biscotti and sausage and chocolate.  The shower in the bathroom was pure luxury.  The king size bed was sooo comfortable.  The room is very soundproof.  The espresso machine made delicious espresso.  The turn down service before bed is heavenly. I could go on and on.  This hotel is just fabulous.  Thank you to all the amazing people who work at The Serras.  You run a perfect hotel. ",5,2017,01,17
18,"Great place, excellent location, awesome staff","This is the place you want to be when coming to Barcelona; from the time i got in all the staff took care of me the best possible way. I found an hand-written message in my room that welcomed me along with a few treats(chorizo, biscuits, chocolate...). Room was gorgeous and stunningly equipped. The shower head was probably the biggest i have ever seen in my life! Lovely hotel, absolutely recommended",5,2017,01,16
18,Fantastic hotel. Great staff.,"Stayed in Barcelona many times but first time in the Serras and was extremely happy with our stay. Really nice room, bed great and pillows amazing! Very quiet, didn't get any road noise. Restaurant was amazing, possibly the best meal I have ever had. Cocktail bar was great, wrapped under a blanket on a cold night by the fire, sipping Mochitos. Great. And last but best mention goes to the staff who could not do more to make our stay more pleasurable. Very, very attentive and genuinely friendly. I work abroad and travel all around the world with my work. Hotel Serras in Barcelona is the single best hotel I have ever stayed in and worth its rating. Thanks to everyone for making our stay so special.",5,2017,01,15
18,Truly the best service I ever had from a hotel.,"I picked the Hotel Serras from reading all of the great reviews on Trip Advisor.  I was a little skeptical because every review was great, but thought, even if the place was half as good as the reviews it would be great.  The reviews are correct.  The staff is on a mission to be the best hotel.  I am talking from check in to check out.  Doorman to wait staff to restaurant.  Every person I interacted with wanted to make sure I had everything I needed.  Besides the people, the hotel was in a great location.  You are at the end of the Gothic area, everything is walking distance.  There are small convenience type markets close, where you can refill your liquor or snacks.  The only time I needed a cab was for the airport.  The rooms were clean with high end linens and mattresses.  The manager, who personally escorted us to our room when we checked in told us the mattresses are from the same company who provides them for Buckingham Palace. We had an unfortunate situation where one of my kids had come down very ill and the hotel arranged for a doctor to come at 6 in the morning, and I was able to have his fees (surely you can't get house-calls in the USA) put on my hotel bill.   Prior to that, the staff was genuinely caring and making sure he had tea and whatever he needed.  If you like small, high end, boutique hotels with over the top service, this hotel is the best. The reviews are really true.",5,2017,01,14
18,Wonderful experience from start to finish!,"Myself and my husband have just returned from a three night stay at Hotel The Serras.  We were greeted on arrival by wonderful friendly staff and a complimentary glass of cava!  As we were too early for check-in we were shown to the beautiful roof top terrace, where we enjoyed some January sunshine and the views of Barcelona.  After some lovely chilling out time, we were brought to our super comfortable room by Deigo Altamira, the Reception Manager, who was extremely courteous and helpful throughout our stay.  The breakfast was beautiful!  We finished off our evenings on the roof top terrace, where blankets were provided and fire-effect heaters were placed close by to ensure that all guests were as comfortable as possible.  A truly beautiful hotel, in a fabulous location and we will definitely be back!!",5,2017,01,10
18,Tremendous staff at delightful hotel,"Our amazing trip to Barcelona over Christmas was wonderful and what put our trip over the top was the tremendous care we received at The Serras. A charming hotel with fewer than 30 rooms makes for a VIP stay. The rooms and bathrooms are pristine and the housekeeping superb. We loved discovering what special treat was laid by our bed (mini gourmet cupcake, chocolate mouse, etc). The location can't be beat, situated by the marina and within walking distance to every major sight. And tremendous tapas eateries are very close. 

But what puts this hotel above so many others is the staff. The staff always had a big hello and went out of their way to help us in any way. They helped us via email to set up tickets and tours even before we arrived. When we arrived at 7:30 AM with a long jet-lagged day ahead of us, Daniel took such great care of us with fresh orange juice and warm fragrant towels to refresh ourselves, as well as a carefully marked map to start off our touring day. They called us when our rooms were ready. Daniel, Susana and Jan were the staff we saw everyday and they greeted us like VIP which was a luxurious way to vacation. They happily helped us with tickets, tours, taxi's, boarding passes, and even sent us off with an amazing breakfast box on our day of departure.  When we informed them our rooms were a bit on the warm side (we New Englanders can take cold!) they immediately re-set our rooms from winter to summer mode so we could run the air conditioning. That is not something a big hotel could do. We wanted to try local food and Daniel, Susana and Jan all recommended top tapas places and restaurants. 

The restaurant at The Serras called ""Informal"" was exquisite. The meals were so amazing we ended up eating there four times. We tried foods (pigeon) we never would have thought to try, but the preparation and presentation of the meals were remarkable. We appreciated tasting local Catalan foods with the chef's extra flair. And the staff were so attentive and charming. 

The breakfasts are included and are more than your standard European continental breakfast. Wonderful salmon and ham (jamón Ibérico) were delicious on local Catalan tomato bread. Pastries were gourmet and it was too hard to resist leaving without one or two delicious macarons.

We said goodbye to an incredible hotel with friendly and professional staff which made it tougher to leave a beautiful and charming city. One of the best vacations we've ever had.",5,2017,01,10
18,"Only one night, so already want to come back!","We unfortunately only stayed at The Serras for one night, but we'd be so eager to return if we're fortunate enough to make it back to Barcelona.  The front desk staff was absolutely incredible in welcoming us.  The room was beautiful and they took the time to walk us through the hotel to explain the amenities.  Such exceptional service was a real treat, we hope to be back for a much longer stay!",5,2017,01,09
18,The most welcoming most beautiful Design Hotel,"Worth the trip To Barcelona just to discover this charming design Boutique Hotel - This was my fourth visit to this exciting city but my first to the Series and I can say the welcome was sincere and warm the staff took there time at check in to welcome us to the city and familiarise us with the location. The hotel is compact but the design of the rooms is a masterstroke of luxuries design. Everything is bang on perfect, in the right place with the correct lighting and the bathroom is fab.",5,2017,01,05
18,The Serras is superb! Best staff.,"We loved our stay at The Serras. The staff are incredible, the rooms are charming, and the restaurant is top notch. It is close to the beach, the Gothic Quarter, and La Rambla - making it the perfect base for exploring Barcelona.",5,2017,01,04
18,The best hotel we have ever stayed in,"We have just returned from a very special New Years break in Barcelona staying at the very special Hotel Serras.
We have been lucky enough to enjoy holidays in the Maldives. Mauritius, Barbados etc which were amazing but the welcome from Jan, Antonio and Susanna was extra special and remained so throughout our 3 day stay - nothing was too much trouble as they genuinely wanted us to enjoy every aspect of our stay!  Breakfast was amazing as were the girls that served us endless coffee every morning. We were lucky enough to have marina view rooms on higher floors as requested which as previously reviewed were tastefully decorated with very comfy beds and the best turn down service we have experienced with lovely touches of a mini desert and water and even fresh towels etc.
We had a fabulous evening seeing in 2017 on the roof terrace with a great DJ, the amazing views, fireworks and more special touches!
We would only stay here when visiting Barcelona in the future.
A massive thank you to all the staff - (a speciall thank you to Jan) - Happy New Year!",5,2017,01,01
18,A Very Special Hotel,"After many days in Barcelona, Nice and Monte Carlo, we made our way back to Barcelona for one last night before our return to Canada. I'm a fan of the Mandarin Oriental chain and was torn between a stay there vs the Hotel Serras. Without over reading the previous reviews, I decided on this property.

Check-in was flawless. Ludmila and company were very attentive and looked after every detail perfectly. Rooms. The beds are insanley comfortable. I rarely sleep well on any bed, normally waking up often and never sleeping soundly. This bed has some sort of strange magic as I slept perfectly for the first time in months. I love the simple yet stylish clean decor. Dinner at the hotel. The food was very good. Likely our best dinner of the trip. Oh, Jenn made my first perfect Grey Goose martini. A very pleasant surprise since so many many hotels and lounges get it wrong. Location. Literally steps from everything you'd want to see in Barcelona. I wish I could remember the little tapas places close by, all amazing. 

I'll be back in Barcelona for the F1 testing at Catalunya, I'll be staying here.",5,2016,12,31
18,The Serras 5***** all round,"Splendid visit to The Serras. The views from the rooftop bar are fantastic: with sights such as the W, the marina and tibidabo all visible from floor 6. The staff are impeccable and there is nobody better than Susanna on the front desk and Jan- always a fresh smile and love when he opens the door! I'll be sure to be back on my next visit. ",5,2016,12,31
18,Beautiful small hotel with an excellent welcome,We spent 3 nights during Christmas period and I found the Serras to be an excellent stop in Barcelona. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Rooms are very cozy and comfortable. I would recommand this address to visitors.,5,2016,12,30
18,Fabulous!,"Cosy, stylish, friendly, tidy, great views from the rooftop terasse... I could continue this list of praise for a while for this fairly new hotel. Nothing to complain, except that is a bit expensive. But I don't know how I could ever stay in another hotel in Barcelona after this. Such a treat, one of my best hotel experiences ever!",5,2016,12,27
18,Incredible!,"I stayed there for 3 nights with my boyfriend and my parents, and we all had a wonderful time. Everyone that works there is extremely welcoming, helpful and kind. The hotel itself was also very charming and we didn't want to leave! We wish we could have spent more time on the rooftop where Picasso used to paint. It was truly a lovely stay and highly recommended!! ",5,2016,12,25
18,Delighted!,"Stayed as a family for Christmas.

Hotel is small and put together like expensive jewelry. 

Staff attention has wowed us. Unhurried effort in response to all requests from a cup of coffee at breakfast to reservations at popular restaurants.

Rooms have been very pleasing, nice sizes for Europe with quality linens, mattress, high level but simple finishes and cleanliness.

Great location on edge of Gothic quarter and waterfront (Port Vell). On busy avenue with great exterior soundproofing and security. 

If you share our belief that service makes the difference then you'll be very happy.",5,2016,12,24
18,Almost excellent,"Most has been said by others, we had very elegant modern junior suite with a really excellent bathroom, wonderfully lit. I had some trouble making the Jacuzzi work  but I fear that is my problem with multifunction switches. The beds are superbly comfortable although I could have done with somewhere more comfortable to sit and read. What was truly unbearable was the muzack playing ghastly American Christmas songs all day and all night over and over again.  We almost did not eat in the restaurant because of the terrible noise although it seemed quieter slightly in the restaurant. The staff appeared tired of it too. This class of hotel should ban this rubbish. Staff were all friendly and went out of their way to solve minor problems. I would recommend it but not just before Christmas.",4,2016,12,21
18,3 wonderful days in Barcelona ,"Having traveled to Barcelona numerous times I was looking forward to returning to one of my favorite cities. After reviewing hotels on TA I booked the Hotel Serras. 

This is now my favorite hotel! Staff including Daniel went out of their way to assure my son and I had a fantastic stay. The room was a good size with a fantastic shower and amenities. Maid service and overall quality of the facilities was exceptional. 

Can not recommend any better place to stay in this wonderful city. ",5,2016,12,18
18," location & hotel reception top notch","Stayed here November on way to London from Germany to warm up a bit freezing in Europe so nice to walk around in the sun for a few days..Bottle of bubbles was a nice touch also..
The Rooms are small & face another building, so we upgraded to water facing Jnr suite, it was light & airy
It just not quite quirky enough to be boutique, but feel value for money it  pretty good, Only issue was breakfast not included which seems a bit of a mean up sell that would create a more a better experience & connect you with the venue going's on. All of those points maybe minor as location is brilliant & staff follow hotel procedure & very efficient, 
You can tell it's a good service culture & well operated.",5,2016,12,18
18,Hidden Gem,"I spend my life in great hotels around the World but the Serras is a Gem. Great location, great comfort in a beautiful building but best of all fantastic, attentive staff and team that love 'their' product. And what a product. Beautifully presented , cool chic but with a purpose. Not style for style sake, all designed for you as the guest. So don't waste time on other venues, this is the one.
I don't normally eat in but it has Avery good chef and food. Clams, Turbot and Local chess with a really good wine list.
",5,2016,12,16
18,Nice but....,"We stayed as a couple for four nights at the Serras from 8-12 December. The locations is across the road from the beach and has great sea views from the rooftop bar. It's is also quite an accessible location for travelling around the city using the metro, bus or cabs.
The staff are mostly very welcoming and helpful. 
The room we stayed in was small compared to other hotels in the same price range we have stayed at but very comfortable and adequate for this trip. The facilities are modern and stylish and you do feel it is a luxurious hotel. However,for us the room we were given was facing the alleyway therefore we endured noise from people drinking in the bar in the alleyway. This did take away the feel of this being a luxurious hotel. Furthermore, the maids office I think it was was next to our room and everyone they opened the door it creaked very loudly. 
There are many great things about this hotel but it could be better. Perhaps the experience is different in a better room.",4,2016,12,15
18,Great service,"Well located and they try their best to take care of all your needs.
Highly recommended for a great base in Barcelona in a terrific location.
Comfortable and professional. You can easily walk to Barceloneta and the Barrio Gotico. Easily the best hotel we've tried in Barca. The rooftop terrace bar is enchanting.",5,2016,12,14
18,Barcelona trip,I loved the Serras hotel. The staff were all lovely and so sweet and helpful. The location was great for going to the beach area and the ramblas. Can't say enough good things about it. Before u go to bed there is a special homemade treat waiting for you.,5,2016,12,10
18,First class service,We chose this hotel to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and wanted it to be first class and we were not disappointed. The hotel contacted us by email and phone prior to our visit to ensure our visit went well. On arrival we were given a glass of Cava whilst we registered and were given a guided tour of the hotel. In our room we had a complementary bottle of Cava to celebrate our anniversary. During our stay nothing we asked for was ever too much trouble and we always got a friendly welcome whenever we returned to the hotel. Our room whilst not that large was beautifully appointed with excellent decoration as was the rest of the hotel. Of course all this comes at a cost and it is a relatively expensive hotel but we thought it was worth it.,5,2016,12,09
18,Fantastic stay ,"We visited for a couple of nights as a family. The hotel is beautiful and in a great position opposite the marine and at the edge of the old town. What really stands out though are the fantastic staff. Sandra in particular was delightful - she showered attention on our 4 year old boy, who still asks after her. We were made to feel very welcome as a family in what is a very chic hotel. Anastasia sorted out our room and our reservations so well, and the Irish lady at the pool (apologies I have forgotten your nam) looked after us there. One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. We would return in a heartbeat. ",5,2016,12,07
18,best hotel in barcelona by far,"so....i can go on describing the warmth phone call prior to our arrival,the amazing welcome when we checked in,the very clean and well decorated room,the chilled cava bottle on ice and a plate of assorted sweets that await our arrival,the tour of the hotel,helpful and friendly staff,the ongoing effort to help us in booking/printing tickets/taxi/maps etc etc,the tasteful decor of the hotel,the perfect location in the gotic quarter,the little amenities that we found in the room at night...
but better you just check in and become royalty for a couple of days.
enjoy!",5,2016,12,06
18,Good to stay ,"Four days stay in this hotel, with friendly staff specially on reception,very clean,good restaurant,rooftop bar with fantastic view to Barcelona harbor. Good location, could walk around and to many museums,shopping areas. ",4,2016,11,30
18,Great Boutique Hotel in Gothic Quarter ,"Hotel The Serras is a beautiful boutique property opposite the port in the gothic quarter area of Barcelona.  The rooms are nicely designed with a beautiful bottle of cava to welcome us and also nice touches like macaroons with your complimentary bottle water in the evening.  

The informal restaurant is a nice place for dinner and the Le nine bar and lounge on level 1 is a great place to do some work or planning and enjoy coffee, food or drinks.  The rooftop bar also has a great view.

Finally the concierge were extremely helpful booking our wine tour and also local shows.

A great spot for our Barcelona stay.",5,2016,11,27
18,Long weekend Friday until Tuesday walk/metro Barcelona trip,"This hotel is modern and rather beautiful. The outstanding element is the staff. They are genuine, friendly and very professional. We had one dinner in the restaurant and this was great. Breakfast is a good set-you-up with fruit, croissant, and a variety of eggs as scrambled/omelette etc. (quality high and service professional and natural) our choice each day. If you want a trendy bath in the room and a TV which emerges from a unit go for 401. The pool on the roof is a small plunge pool type and the roof is cool with a bar and views. There is a library type sitting area and a gym (lots of joggers outside along the water front though). The décor is high spec. and you will be made very welcome. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,11,24
18,Beautiful hotel with incredible service!,"From the moment we arrived, we were treated like family. We were given a thorough briefing of Barcelona and shown on a map all of the popular areas and sites to visit. We were offered cava, but since it was early, we decided on Lattes that were served at the rooftop bar area which has a beautiful ambiance and view. The location of the hotel is perfect - it is just on the edge of the Gothic quarter, a quick walk to Las Ramblas and other touristy areas. We loved being just slightly out of the busiest part of the city - it was calm and quiet. All of the dinner recommendations given to us by the staff of the hotel were amazing. They also helped us plan a trip to Montserrat on our own, providing us with 10 pages of printed details on train schedules, ticket options, etc.
Our room was located in the front of the hotel on the 3rd floor. The room was very quiet considering the busy street out front. The shower and the bed were exemplary. The closet space and drawer space is a little less than we are used to, but it was not an issue.
Overall, this property exudes class and style. You cannot go wrong by choosing this as your base for a memorable stay in Barcelona!",5,2016,11,23
18,"Amazing, Perfect","Five-star service, concierge, rooms, bar, cleanliness. The best hotel we ever stayed in. The beds and pillows are extremely comfortable. Price is reasonable compared to five star hotels in other major cities. Don't hesitate to stay here- you will really enjoy!!",5,2016,11,18
18,"Location, Picasso, Roof Top and Beds fit for the queen","Yes, it's my new favorite hotel in the heart of the action of La Rambla, the Gothic District and Port area.   Location, location Location, outstanding for exploring and views from the rooftop, Wow! 

I was told Picasso painted in the building behind the rooftop bar.  The Serras honors him with his picture and a plaque on the rooftop.   It was beautiful weather in November so the rooftop was not wasted.  

My room was 505, beautiful clean lines, white space, spacious and ohhhh the bed.  The beds are made by the official bed producer of the beds in Buckingham palace( so I was told).  After two nights, I believed them.  

I don't think the glass door to the patio was double Paned as I did hear some noise at night from random loud people outside the street.  But not enough to ruin my sleep.  

The staff was incredible.  Always walking me to the road to call a taxi or give information on where I was going.  

The restaurant.... Informal, was a nice surprise.  I had 5 friends join me and they absolutely loved every dish.  We ordered family style and spent at least three hours enjoying the variety of dishes.  

Overall, I loved it.  I would definitely return and recommend the hotel.  Next time, maybe a suite looking out to the sea!",5,2016,11,18
18,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"From the welcoming introductory phone call before we arrived, throughout the whole trip and following up afterwards, the staff could not have been more attentive, knowledgeable and efficient. The personalised service every member of the team offered was second to none, without being intrusive in any way. 
The room was lovely, stylish and well-equipped. 
The hotel itself is in a brilliant location, right at the edge of the Gothic quarter, but next to the harbour. The roof terrace, with heaters and blankets offers stunning views. 
The whole experience was fantastic and we can't wait to return",5,2016,11,16
18,Small but perfectly formed,"Not a large hotel, but with the service and quality of a giant.
Perfectly appointed rooms with some lovely design features.
Staff extremely helpful and pleasant to deal with.
Spotlessly clean - full praise to housekeeping. 
Intimate roof garden/bar - would love to try it on a balmy summer evening.
Just across from the ""Face"" and a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas and the Cathedral, so  perfectly located for the gothic quarter with all its quirks.
5 stars? - you bet!",5,2016,11,16
18,Nice boutique hotel right at the harbour,"This 28 room boutique hotel is a member of Design Hotels which represents and markets a selection of more than 260 independent hotels in over 50 countries across the globe. The Serras is located at Barcelona Harbour and is just a few walking minutes away from most of the attractions. 

Service of the hotel is impeccable. It was my partner's birthday and we were given an immediate upgrade & got Cava and strawberries delivered to our room. All areas of the hotel are nicely furnished and decorated. Breakfast is a must and is so much worth 26 EUR per person. We did not have a chance to have lunch or dinner at the hotel but the menu looked delicious.

The room we got had a comfortable mattrass and a great bathroom. The room we had was a bit dark, since located on one of the lowest floors. If possible, try to get a room on one of the top floors! 

The terrace was great, even though it was too cold to enjoy it to the full. By the way, it had been extended and looked much larger than in the photos. 

All in all, the Serras is a charming and very individual hotel with great staff! Thank you for your warm welcome!",4,2016,11,15
18,Almost Perfect,"The Serras is a very pretty hotel right on the harbor, near the cruise ships and yachts, and near the Ramblas. The staff is terrific, the room lovely. The rooftop bar and pool is also really nice. It was a little cool, and guests were given blankets for comfort.
We were greeted with a drink, and there is complimentary cava, coffee and tea in the room; nice touch.
I would have gladly given the hotel five stars, but for a couple of goofs on their part. The guest card that came with the cava had someone else's name on it, so did not know if we were in the correct room. We asked for some more tea bags. They never came. We asked for a wake up call. It never came. None of these were major issues, but they do keep the place from being perfect. I would happily recommend the hotel to anyone coming to Barcelona.",4,2016,11,12
18,What an INCREDIBLE find!!,"I travel the globe, often 3 weeks out of 4, and I would have no hesitation in stating that I have stayed in 100's of hotels, and with the exception perhaps of the St. Regis in Singapore, this is probably the finest hotel room have stayed in. 

Whatever your boxes are, be assured you'll be able to check them...
Incredible and individualized service - check!
Professional staff - check!
Go above and beyond - check!
Think about things even you didn't think of - check!
""Knock your socks off"" rooms and bathrooms - check!
Fine cuisine - check!
Location, location, location - check!

I cannot recommend this place highly enough!  ",5,2016,11,10
18,Perfect in every way!,"I am not sure where to begin to explain just how special this hotel is.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty by the best staff we have ever met in any hotel anywhere in the world.  It is not just training, which must be excellent, but a feeling that nothing is too much trouble and they really care about how you are enjoying your stay. They will tell you it is because they are like a family and it shows. Diego and his team on reception couldn't have helped us more.  A wonderful upgrade for our thirtieth wedding anniversary, faultless recommendations for restaurants and always a warm welcome back at the end of the day.  This all works because they really listen to their guests. The restaurant staff at breakfast and dinner are friendly and efficient and they know their menu and their wines extremely well.  Both are delicious. The suite was beautifully designed, the beds incredibly comfortable and all kept in immaculate condition by housekeeping. The roof top bar was wonderful. Too cold for the pool but with blankets offered if it got a little chilly and a warm fire to sit round on a colder evening. Antonio was often around to chat with guests and make sure we were happy. His guiding hand and warm personality are obvious in the way this hotel is run.  I am sorry if this all sounds too good to be true.  It isn't!  Try it and you won't be disappointed.",5,2016,11,08
18,New Boutique Hotel close to Gothic Area,"This is a nice hotel in the old Gothic area which is also close to the Sea, which is very convenient for walking everywhere. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the hotel is very new. We had a Deluxe room which is very small, and there was nowhere to put our clothes besides a few hangers in the closet. However the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large, and the rooms were very clean.   We were given a dessert and water bottles at our bedside before bed every night which was delicious.  And we were served champagne while we checked in, which made the task much more enjoyable.  Overall a very nice boutique hotel.  We did not get a chance to enjoy the restaurant or roof-top terrace as there are just so many choices in the area, but they both looked like they would be good.",4,2016,11,08
18,Unparalleled,"This is a wonderful hotel. We came as na fanmily for a short holiday and everything was unique. It began with getting an e-mail before the trip began asking us whether we had any special requests even before I had the opportunity to write them.
Things work in this hotel. Airport transfer? Done, punctual. Pre-order a taxi? Done, again punctual. Restaurant selections, online tickets for museums, all done, even for the tricky Sagrada Familia (my tip: book far ahead!).
Staff are very friendly and personal. Sarah at the front desk took us through the check-in, showed us the room and was very helpful. Sergio ran after almosrt everything, and was so friendly. He asked repeatedly how my son enjoyed Barcelona and in patiocular the game in Camp Nou, and you really feel that he cared and was proud of his city. And finally Sandra, that beacon of light in the morning at breakfast. Of course she already knew the second day what we alöl drank for breakfast and was so kind and personal, that is what I think you really look for when you are on a trip.
Finally, the rooms are beautiful, we had one facing the harbour and that view was awesome, particularly at sunrise. A very, very memorable place.
One small note to motivate: the rooms have special capsules you can stick in the shower to give a special smell (think of Nespresso capsules for the shower), but unfortunately, we didn't get any after the two present were used...but that is a minor matter indeed.",5,2016,11,04
18,Best hotel ever!!,"Wow, what a great hotel. If you're going to Barcelona, don't even think about staying anywhere else. Everything is perfect - location, rooms, food but best of all, the service from the incredible staff. They are simply the best hotel staff you'll ever meet. Special thanks to Sandra, Jan and Sergio for making our family trip so special - the children were practically crying when we were leaving! They made such an effort to make sure that my son's birthday was one he'll never forget. We're already looking forward to our next trip (although we all want to go there for our birthdays now....😉)",5,2016,10,31
18,Perfect,Perfect boutique hotel in perfect location with cool rooftop bar. Superb service from the first moment to the last both in reception and in the ground floor restaurant which we only used for breakfast. Rooms simple in a modern style. Beds incredibly comfortable. Busy road to the front of the property (our rooms were side on the alley way) excellent sound proofing meant a peaceful interior. Literally nothing to fault in this five star boutique.,5,2016,10,30
18,Best Hotel we have EVER stayed in,"We stayed at this amazing Hotel for 5 nights early October. From the moment we arrived we were greeted at the door with welcoming smiles and a complimentary glass or two of Cava, then shown to our room after a wonderful description of the surrounding areas and recommendations where to visit.  The service is second to none. The food at the Informal is truly amazing. The Rooftop Bar with it's outstanding views - also a wonderful place for a drink and some great Tapas. Our deepest thanks go to the wonderful staff Antonio, Daniel, Sandra, Amy, Maria and Anna.",5,2016,10,27
18,"Wow, Wow, Wow.","This hotel has basically reached perfection in service, style, cleanliness, and comfort.  We checked out this morning, and were so happy we chose this amazing hotel for our arrival to Europe.  Elizabeth welcomed us on arrival (after a very long trip) with a beautiful glass of cava and a tour of the hotel.  We were upgraded to a junior suite overlooking the harbor and the sea.  Neve welcomed us at the rooftop bar while we were waiting for our room to be prepared.  The rooftop is so chic and has fantastic views of the city.  Antonio (GM) left a bottle of cava and a lovely snack once our room was ready.  We've stayed at some pretty nice places, and this one is top of that list.  Don't question, just book.",5,2016,10,26
18,Truly perfect boutique 5 star,"I was concerned about finding that perfect spot for our trip to Barcelona.  I knew before we arrived that this was my kind of place.  Excellent communication from the staff Elena, Elisabeth and Anastasiya, set up our expedited arrival and transfer flawlessly. Diego, the Front Office Manager set us up with great dinners, a spectacular Best of Costa Brava tour, and could not have made us feel more at home. Hotel restaurant Informal had the best organic breakfast sandwiches imaginable, and dinner (twice) was beyond delicious.  Chateaubriand may have been the most flavorful ever tasted. Michelin Star Chef with spot on choices and terrific wine selection.  Roof top bar with awesome marina views as well as front row seat to the perfect full moon rising made for an evening we will never forget.  5 Star service, bed was voted best in world 2015, shower unlike anything I've ever experienced.  Truly exceeded our highest expectations.  Kudos!",5,2016,10,25
18,Fantastic hotel,We booked our two night stay in October at the Serras having read favourable reviews on Tripadvisor. Check in smooth with a complimentary drink of choice. The deluxe room was cozy and very clean with a super bathroom. The shower fabulous. Food in the hotels Michelin starred restaurant delicious. The roof top bar and service excellent. And the clincher - FREE Wifi. We would not consider for a minute staying elsewhere on future visits to Barcelona having visited this wonderful city on four occasions before.,5,2016,10,25
18,A wonderful oasis in Barcelona ,"Too often you get off a long flight and you are exhausted after hours in the air - but Hotel Serras takes you into it's beautiful space, puts you in a lovely calm room and it even has about the best outdoor space in any city. Do I recommend it? Indeed
I do and the staff are all delightful and helpful. ",5,2016,10,25
18,Made our Honeymoon Special!,"The Serras exceeded every expectation that we could have hoped for. At every step the staff were exceptional and always warm and accommodating. The rooms are beautiful, the terrace was a joy and the restaurant had amazing food that we came back a second time for. The Serras truly provide a first class experience and made our Honeymoon feel special. ",5,2016,10,23
18,"Beautiful, boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona","We loved our stay at Hotel The Serras!  The staff is unusually helpful and friendly - they really go out of their way to make sure you are well cared for.  The room was lovely, the food delicious and the view from the rooftop deck to the harbor is beautiful.  It is at the south edge of the gothic area so it is easy to explore all the shops and cafes from this hotel.  
Unquestionably a five star experience!
Thank you!",5,2016,10,22
18,Small and perfect,"It is # 1 in Barcelona, as it should be. The rooms although not very big by American standards are sufficient for a short stay. They are very clean, very comfortable and you don't hear the city noises although you are right there. The all around service is above standard, especially the concierge ( Diego ) who will go out of his way to satisfy you. The terrassa on the top floor offers a nice view of the marina and the personnel will take care of you. All in all, I will go back.",5,2016,10,21
18,Great Time In Barcelona,"This was a great hotel.  It's in the Gothic Quarter which is really cool to just walk around and look at the architecture.  It's only about two blocks from La Ramblas, and just across the street from the boardwalk.  I read many reviews and articles that said to watch out for pickpockets.  But we didn't have any trouble and felt very safe at all times.  It's actually a very nice area to walk, but if you want to go further, it's also extremely easy to catch a taxi right outside, and they're very inexpensive.  

The hotel itself was very nice.  It's very contemporary and looks freshly updated.  The staff were all incredible from check-in to housekeeping, to one of the guys getting taxis and carrying our bags for us. I can't say enough about how great they were.  They airline had lost my luggage two days previously in Amsterdam.  Then we went to Barcelona and I thought I would probably just never see it again.  But the hotel informed me when it arrived at the airport and I could go pick it up.  

They say they have the most comfortable beds in the world.  I didn't see what was so special about them, but I guess that's just my opinion.",5,2016,10,19
18,the best way to end our vacation...,"My husband and I stayed in the Serras for the last 3 nites of our vacation.  From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty!  From the cool drinks and towels to the personalized attention, the entire staff is amazing. A special thanks to Sandra Bellet, who took care of my husband the morning he was feeling under the weather.  Also, to Diego the jack-of-all-trades hotel manager who reset our tv without making a comment about what we did to mess it up in the first place!  From the roof top terrace to the lobby restaurant the food was exceptional.  As my husband said, we did not just have dinner - we had a dining experience!  The rooms are beautiful and clean. The location is the best - close to everything. To show you how attentive the staff is - we came back to the hotel for lunch at the Rooftop; a gentleman came up a few moments later and cleaned our eye glasses for us! Where else would this happen! The only bad thing was that we had to leave!   We really hope to come back soon - thanks for a great stay!   Sincerely, Sherri Siegel",5,2016,10,19
18,Loved this hotel!,"We loved our room, the service, and especially the view from the rooftop pool and bar. The breakfast was wonderful--everything you could imagine was offered, and the food was top-notch. This hotel's location is wonderful for walking the city. The hotel arranged for us to get a guided walking tour of city highlights. They also arranged for our transportation from our cruise ship and then to the airport on the day that we left. We were 100% pleased with everything.",5,2016,10,19
18,Amazing!,We had a fantastic stay at the serras. It was made extra special by Diego the hotel manager. His recommendations placed to eat to places to see were spot on! We had an amazing time! Great location to also explore the city by foot which we loved. We will be back!,5,2016,10,18
18,Barcelona 2016,"The hotel and staff are excellent. Great location, nice clean rooms, ultra quiet with triple pane windows and extra thick doors. The staff came out to meet us on the street to help us with our bags. Great advice and help booking restaurants. overall a great experience. Plus the roof bar is the best.",5,2016,10,15
18,Simply the Best!,"Three nights at Hotel The Serras was the highlight of our world trip. From check-in to check-out the staff were more than attentive to our needs and went well beyond normal expectations. This is a beautiful boutique style hotel, we were upgraded on check in to a front room with an ocean view which was lovely, but unfortunately it had no bath.  When the staff realised that a bath was important to us they arranged a room swap the next day, they felt bad as it didn't have the same view, but to us it was perfect, quiet, and with an amazing relaxing spa bath and a bit of extra space for our world-tour size luggage. Perfect. Comfortable beds, great amenities, turndown service with a fresh cake each night. Perfect location to La Rambla.  The rooms are stylish, fresh and well thought out. Breakfast is amazing and we only wish we had dined in the hotel restaurant for the whole three nights because our meal on our last night was one of the best we had on our entire tour. We made great use of the rooftop bar with its views over the marina and great service and cocktails.  If we were to return to Barcelona I would REFUSE to stay anywhere else. Hang the expense. You deserve to stay here!",5,2016,10,12
18,Perfect,"My girlfriend and I spent one night here and all I can say is wow! From the moment We walked in to the moment we left, we were treated like royalty. This might be a small hotel which you may miss if you didn't know about it but it is better than any of the bigger less personable hotels around. As we walked in we were welcomed with cava and a hot towel and talked through the hotel before being given a tour of all the facilities. The bedroom was clean and modern with a really comfy bed. It really felt like luxury. The mini bar and snacks were really reasonably priced for a 5star hotel. There is a small but adequate gym and a pleasant and comfortable restaurant that serves a tasty breakfast. The surprise was the fantastic roof garden that has character and great views across the harbour and city. The service by all staff was fantastic and you were spoken to by name each time, definitely not known by room numbers here! As we were about to depart the service continued with a personal goodbye from the manager and you really feel like they care. The hotel is centrally placed for a visit to the city and the staff can recommend anything you want. A stay I will not forget. Thank you.
",5,2016,10,11
18,WOW WHAT A VIEW,"from reception to the roof top terrace this is a first class establishment. did not have the pleasure of staying or eating. 

the view from the terrace was beautiful and the drinks and service impeccable

one for the list for our next trip",5,2016,10,11
18,Excellent in all areas,"We stayed for five nights and thoroughly enjoyed Barcelona and the hotel. The staff were all very attentive and helpful. We can also thoroughly recommend its restaurant the Informal. The roof top bar is also very good. Check the mini bar for a cheeky twist, never seen that before!",5,2016,10,07
18,Personal Service and Luxury,"All the luxury you would expect from a 5 star Spanish hotel.  The roof pool is small but pleasant with a nice view of the harbor.  The restaurant offered a top quality meal, and the lobby and guests boasted a stylish vibe.  Dress to impress.",5,2016,10,06
18,The superb Hotel  Serras!,"From the moment of arrival to departure we received 1st class service in this top class hotel.  We stayed five nights and not only enjoyed the hotel experience immensely, we thoroughly enjoyed all that Barcelona has to offer.  On arrival we were greeted with a very welcome glass of Cava.  Anastasia gave us great advice on places to visit and recommended restaurants for us.  Antonio and his staff certainly do everything to make the visit as enjoyable as possible.  The hotel is well situated for both the beach and main attractions, with a wonderful terrace bar.  The room, although classed as standard, was spacious and kept impeccably clean with the most wonderful bed and pillows.  The turn down service, with a small cake and complimentary water, was a lovely gesture.  The bathroom was well appointed with two basins and a terrific shower - lovely toiletries too!  The breakfast was excellent with a good choice of both hot and cold food, combined with excellent service.  As you can tell we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and certainly hope to return next year.  Thank you Antonio and to all your staff for making our stay so memorable.",5,2016,10,04
18,Amazing hotel!,"We stayed here shortly after the hotel first opened and we cannot fault it whatsoever. the hotel decor is beautiful - exquisitely designed and just stunning. The restaurant is great for breakfast and the rooftop terrace is brilliant for drinks and chilling out. Great local restaurant recommendations from the hotel staff. Stay here, you will not regret it!",5,2016,10,02
18,Fabulous Stay...,"This hotel understands the true definition of hospitality.  Everyone is welcoming and attends to every detail imaginable.  The rooms are modern, comfortable, and impeccably clean.  The service is very personal and attentive - for drinks, for tapas in the Rooftop Bar (which has awesome views), in the Informal Restaurant for breakfast or for a gourmet dinner.    The location is very convenient for the Gothic Quarter, El Born, Las Ramblas, Barcelonetta and more.  We felt completely at home and at ease for our entire stay - from when we were welcomed at the door by Jan with hot towels and a cold glass of cava to when we reluctantly left (we would have stayed longer).   We will definitely go back and will recommend this at THE place to stay when visiting Barcelona.",5,2016,10,02
18,Very nice,All around top notch high end hotel.  Excellent service and high quality fixtures in room. Location was very convenient to arrive at and to use as a base for exploring Barcelona.  Ocean view rooms overlook the busy marina area and is best on the high floors.  Don't miss having a drink at the rooftop bar.   Resataurant is by Michelin rated chef.  Don't miss having all four of the tapas offered across the street.,5,2016,10,02
18,A wonderful stay in the Gothic quarter,"This has to be one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. We were welcomed by Antonio and the complimentary glass of cava was the perfect antidote to our long train trip to get to Barcelona. Our room was absolutely gorgeous - modern and very comfortable. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the the shower was the best we have ever experienced in a hotel. 

The breakfast was fantastic - my husband particularly enjoyed the fresh fruit which was frozen - it was very refreshing. The ladies running the show even remembered our specific coffee order - very impressive.

Antonio could not have been more helpful and all the staff made us feel very welcome.

The location is also very good. We walked to the beach, explored the Gothic quarter and even walked to Las Ramblas",5,2016,10,01
18,Lovely boutique hotel in a fantastic location in the Gothic Quarter,"The Serras is a very comfortable, modern hotel with most of the amenities you would expect from a small luxury hotel. Warm, professional service and a fantastic bed with lovely linens. It is perfectly located in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, with hundreds of restaurants, bars, shops, and fabulous architecture. We walked virtually everywhere, including to the Sagrada Familia, Guell Park and the W Hotel's rooftop bar on the beach for a sunset drink. Those were long walks, but Barcelona is a walking city! But it is also very easy to catch a taxi on the corner of the hotel. 

A few minor quibbles keep me from giving it a 5-star review. One, the small pool on the roof is not heated and was almost too frigid to use in mid-September. As nice as the staff was, the concierge service was not very helpful when we tried to find a reservation for a special dinner. They seemed to want to steer us to the hotel restaurant. While the food at breakfast was terrific, the dining room is not really that special, and we didn't want to eat dinner there. They didn't seem to know much about some of the less touristy attractions, and weren't of much assistance in helping us.",4,2016,09,28
18,Delightful fabulous nicely pampered!,"This hotel is a GEM.  We were so well cared for, The room was beautiful, very contemporary and luxurious.  Champagne and coffee in our room along with a hand written welcome note.  Delicious food from the chief in the dining room.  Great location by the Sea, shopping, many street cafes to try.  Extraordinary staff helping us with our bikes and rented van.  WE highly recommend and we will be back.",5,2016,09,25
18,Great Hotel,"We had a wonderful few days at this chic hotel. Great attentive staff, superb facitilites and great location. For us, everything seemed to have been thought of, couldn't have asked for more. Definitely be back next time we visit Barcelona ",5,2016,09,24
18,Amazing boutique hotel - highly recommended,"We had a fantastic stay at The Serras and would absolutely recommend this hotel. We were greeted by warm towels and cava on arrival and once we checked into our room, we found a complimentary bottle of cava and tapas waiting for us along with a lovely note from the hotel manager congratulating us on our wedding anniversary. 

The hotel itself is very stylish and beautifully decorated, with beautiful flower displays and lovely furniture. Our room was lovely - a great size with a lovely shower and bathroom area. The location is great, within easy walking distance on El Born and Las Rambles and has stunning views of the port. 

All of the staff are very friendly, always smiling and were very helpful whenever we had any questions or were looking for restaurant recommendations. 

This hotel really looks after its guests - it has that lovely boutique hotel touches that larger hotels just don't have. Every evening we returned to our room to find bottles of water and chocolates waiting for us. Drinks at the hotel balcony were lovely - we spent many hours up there in the sunshine, enjoying the views and a some lovely drinks. 

The Serras is a fantastic hotel - we would recommend it to all of our friends and will definitely stay there if we visit Barcelona again. ",5,2016,09,22
18,Light modern hotel with a young atmosphere. Amazing Staff,"Me, my Husband and my 3 years old daughter have stayed 1 night at The Serras prior to our cruise trip in August 2016, the location was perfect for us where it was only 10 minutes away from the port and a very short drive from the airport.
Light modern hotel with a young atmosphere. From the moment you walk through the door and enter the hotel, there is not a single minute where the staff is not looking after you or trying to anticipate your needs. Check in was so easy and fast (since the day we booked over the phone, the reception were very helpful getting as much information to make sure our stay with our daughter as comfortable as possible).
The food at The Serras was wonderful we had a great breakfast and a delightful lunch.
The room was contemporary and beautiful, it had an unbelievable comfy bed and linens. Bathroom was spacious and the staff had arranged toys and a basket full of pampers, baby shampoo, bath gel, toothbrush, toothpaste and a rubber duck for my 3 years old daughter (very thoughtful).
We had a lovely experience in this hotel although it was a short stay, however; I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,09,21
18,a perfectly lovely small hotel,"this lovely small quaint hotel is quite a find, -- the service is unparalleled, and it has an excellent Michelin rated chef at the helm of the outstanding restaurant. The roof top garden and pool are a great little oasis and the tapas are terrific as you enjoy a wonderful view of the harbor, its perfectly located to enjoy the historic Gothic section of town, all easily walk-able from the hotel,the rooms while I've had larger ones, are really well appointed and are more then adequate in size, they are thoughtfully done, nicely decorated and functional, each has a small balcony so you can go outside and stand on it, even take a chair or two with you, the rooms are absolutely quiet, which is important in a town that never seems to sleep, and did i say a friendly welcoming staff ready to help at every turn? well., they are!!",5,2016,09,20
18,A slice of heaven,I think one of the best hotels we have visited. Staff over there exude so much of warmth and care that it really makes it a special place to stay. They took care of all our requests and nothing was too much of a trouble for them. Rooms are very stylish and the restaurant food was top notch. We are already missing it so much,5,2016,09,20
18,"Perfection, an oasis in the middle of the city...","I am not easy to please when it comes to hotels. but this hotel hit all the right notes. 

From the moment we walked in, we were transported to maybe our best hotel experience yet in many years of global travel. A lovely refreshing scent (I still need to ask what it is) emanates throughout the lobby. We were escorted to a desk for a private check in, offered cava for the adults/ orange juice for the kids. Above the lobby, there is a lovely loft/lounge for guests. We did not eat at the restaurant just off the lobby, but the food looked wonderful. 

The room -- we had a deluxe room, which was spacious, modern, clean. The bathroom was modern and luxurious, with 2 sinks, separate w/c and rainfall shower. Everything was very clean and new (high praise from someone who typically wipes every hotel room down with Lysol).

Every night, there was turn down services with a little sweet treat (cookies one night, amazing chocolate another). Slippers were left out by the bed. A small bed was made up on the side for our daughter. There is a nespresso machine and minibar (not free, but has everything you might need).  I would love to copy the cabinetry/decor in my own home. 

The rooftop pool/bar was busy but not overly crowded. Great views of the city. Small pool and exercise area (latter is off the loft/lounge), which we also did not have a chance to use.

Service was exceptional -- unassuming, efficient, everything well-executed and with a smile.

Lovely experience. The perfect mix of elegant and comfortable.",5,2016,09,20
18,charmingly perfect,"Hotel The Serras is extremely welcoming in every way.  Well-trained, professional staff greet you warmly on arrival and show you to a room that is nothing short of perfect.
This is an upscale boutique hotel and the rooms feature everything you would expect--lovely contemporary furnishings, a well-appointed bathroom, and very comfy beds and linens.  The rooftop terrace is probably the best I have ever seen.  It features a small pool, substantial seating, and full bar service.  The restaurant serves a fabulous breakfast buffet with hot selections made to order and dinner here is truly memorable. Overlooking the marina, The Hotel Serras, offers a central location with easy walking to the beach, the Rambla, and countless other tourist destinations.  You will not be disappointed if you are lucky enough to stay at this wonderful hotel.",5,2016,09,20
18,Simply Excellent,"Fantastic hotel. Excellent staff, food and rooms. Clean, tidy and nice design. The beds did also have duvets! A beatiful roof terrace with sunbeds and bar
No need to look for any other hotel in Barcelona unless you need more than 28 rooms!",5,2016,09,19
18,Great hotel - amazing servoxe,"Great location, fantastic service from staff. Quality rooms and furnishings, very clean.
If being picky, for the price would expect a bath as well as shower and wouldn't hurt to throw in breakfast. Overall though if a special occasion would definitely recommend.",5,2016,09,19
18,Flawless perfection,"This was our second stay at The Serras, we loved it so much last time that we decided to spend ten days here this time. It is difficult to describe what the best thing about this hotel is because it is consistently excellent. The rooms are comfortable, stylish and spotlessly clean. The decor throughout the hotel is swish, as you would expect with a design hotel, but it is not style over substance. The food at breakfast, on the rooftop and in Informal is superb. The location is perfect to explore Barcelona; El Gotic, El Born and the Marina are on your doorstep. The rooftop bar and pool is a haven in a busy city. But what really stands out? Without exception the whole team are fabulous! Nothing is too much trouble, they have a wealth of knowledge that they will take time to share with you and they genuinely care about your whole experience. It is this that elevates this hotel from just beautiful place to stay in the city, to a home from home. We cannot wait to return and see you again xx",5,2016,09,17
18,Contemporary at its best!,"The Hotel is situated in a perfect location right near the harbor. We originally reserved a room with a harbor view. However, the street below was too noisy for our tastes, so we decided to go with a room right along the alley. The rooftop bar and swimming pool hosts parties on occasion offering an opportunity to mingle with locals and others staying at the hotel. The staff went above and beyond and very much made our stay that much more enjoyable.",5,2016,09,16
18,Outstanding birthday and anniversary stay.,"Staff is excellent and makes you fell like family and assist with any question or suggestions.  The restaurant, Informal, is wonderful and the Rooftop Bar has a beautiful view of the harbor and water.  It is a great place for a late afternoon or evening drink and smack. Hotel location is a huge asset.",5,2016,09,15
18,SUPERB HOTEL,"This is how all hotels should be, wonderful staff, perfect location, excellent food and drink and absolutely notghing is too much trouble for them. If only some of the other so called 5 star hotels aspired to the standard of the Serras, things would be so much better for everyone. It is an experience not to be missed. Would give them 10 stars but the site won't let me!!",5,2016,09,13
18,Amazing hotel with the friendliest staff you'll ever encounter!,"Just stayed at this hotel with my fiancée and we absolutely loved it. When we arrived we were given welcome drinks, followed by a guided tour of the hotel and facilities by the extremely friendly staff. We were also given a map which the staff marked with a list of recommendations to try during our visit which was very helpful as we'd never been to Barcelona before. We instantly felt so welcomed by the very friendly staff.

Our bedroom was gorgeous and the bed very comfortable (apparently they use the same beds as Buckingham palace!), and on our arrival we had a bottle of cava and tapas in the bedroom which really made us feel at home.

The infinity pool on the roof is spectacular and a gorgeous place to relax after a full day of sightseeing with cocktails! We also went to the Michelin star restaurant in the hotel which was fab, and one of the chefs even brought around free oysters for us to try which was lovely. It was a very nice and relaxed atmosphere for a Michelin star restaurant.

Overall, the hotel was a beautiful boutique 5 star hotel, but what really makes the hotel stand out is the amazing and friendly staff! Would definitely recommend and next time we come back to Barcelona we'll definitely be coming back here.",5,2016,09,11
18,Mediterranean Holiday Sep16,"Hotel Serras was wonderful, from the moment you walked in staff were taking care of all your needs, hotel was very central to all the great sites to visit, roof top bar & pool very relaxing. Sandra gave excellent service when having breakfast to start our day & the dinning at night in the restaurant very nice & tasty. A little expensive but that saying you get what you pay for was just excellent over all. ",5,2016,09,11
18,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Such a great welcome! 
Our taxi pulled up. 
We were greeted by two staff literally running to the taxi, ""welcome welcome...let us help you with your bags."" 
Our first impression was this friendly  reception, welcome champagne and juice, and a personal tour of the hotel by a very friendly and helpful staff member. 

We loved coming back to this hotel after a long day in Barcelona and wish we had stayed here longer. 

Beautiful rooms, comfortable bed, large bathroom and great shower. 

There's a perfect sized pool upstairs and a lovely bar. Downstairs, there's a gorgeous restaurant that we wished we had time to try. 

We would definitely stay at the Serras again. A stylish, boutique hotel of just 28 blissful rooms. 
Thank you. ",5,2016,09,10
18,Wonderful service ,"I booked the Serras for a weekend away to celebrate my husband's 40th birthday, and was hoping for something special.

In the lead up to our stay I exchanged a number of emails with the hotel regarding reservations for restaurants and they were extremely helpful.

On arrival, we were given a complimentary glass of cava to sip whilst checking in, and a tour of the facilities.

Our room was lovely, very clean and contemporary. The bathroom was great, a large shower & separate bath. The only thing lacking was a towel rail to hang the bath towels on after showering, we hung them on the hooks on the door but they were still a bit damp in the morning. A minor thing.

The AC in the room was very efficient, especially as the weather was boiling hot outside. It did get somewhat cold in the room, despite increasing the temperature setting, so we switched the AC off at times.
Very comfortable bed & well equipped room, including a kettle & nespresso machine and a wall mounted 3 pin plug socket.

The hotel is very stylish, the lobby & restaurant/bar areas all feel very high-end. 
Breakfast was delicious, as were the drinks we had at the rooftop bar. We ate at Informal on the first night, which was also nice.

The location of the hotel is great, it's opposite the marina area, close to La Rambla and in the Gothic area. Everywhere we wanted to go was within walking distance or a short cab ride away.

The best thing about the hotel was the staff, they were without exception friendly, polite & went out of their way to help us, booking tickets to Sagrada Familia online for us, ordering taxis & ensuring they told the drivers our destination, nothing was too much trouble. A really enjoyable stay & we would love to return one day.
",5,2016,09,10
18,great terrace overlooking the poirt and Barceloneta,"I been there few times through some events and even though its relatively small in size but the roof is really amazing, they had a nice singer with a DJ along with good drinks and cocktails, you can have your GF/BF for a great romantic evening there specially if you're a smoker like me :)",5,2016,09,09
18,As Good As It Gets,"I have been travelling extensively for 43 years, both business and pleasure, and in that time have had the opportunity to experience many five star hotels. I would put The Serras at the top of the list, easily. It scores in every category. It does not have the luxuries opulence of the Ritz Carlton, but it is as chic as they come. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable.  Breakfast and dinner are outstanding. The roof-top Garden is spectacular. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. Never have I encountered a team of people so sincerely dedicated to make certain that every aspect of your stay is perfect. Daniel, the doorman/ porter is one of the most genuinely happy people I have ever seen and his smile and greeting make you happy every time you see him. The rest of the staff  Is sincerely attentive but never in an obsequious or overbearing way.  This hotel simply hits it out of the park; knocks it for six.",5,2016,09,08
18,Perfect place for a romantic city get-away ,"We stayed in the standard double room that had all the comfort you could wish for. Super comfortable bed, spacious bathroom, quiet AC. We were greeted by complimentary cava, delicious tapas and even some surprise dessert macaroons when we returned in the evening. 
While the interior of the hotel is chic and modern, yet warm and welcoming, the true highlight is the roof top terrace. Perfect spot to relax after exploring the city.  The drinks are a bit expensive, as you could expect, but the view and relaxed  atmosphere  are worth it. 
The main reason we can highly recommend The Serras though is the incredibly friendly and helpful staff and outstanding service. They made our stay truly special and I cannot thank them enough. We hope to come back soon :). ",5,2016,09,06
18,Oasis in Gothic Quarter,"The staff at this hotel are incredible! You do not have to decide a thing before your arrival, they will help you plan everything and treat you as royalty. The restaurant has delightful food, the rooms are beautiful, the upstairs bar is trendy, and the location is fantastic.",5,2016,09,05
18,Outstanding Customer Service,"We stayed here for two nights with our 2 year old daughter following a cruise of the Med. This is a beautiful design hotel in a great location within easy walking distance of many of Barcelona's sites. The rooftop terrace is stunning, a great place to watch the sun go down, and has a small plunge pool which is very welcome on a scorching August day.

What really makes this hotel stand out are the staff. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome, not always the case when travelling with an adventurous toddler, and it seemed that nothing was too much trouble. There was even a welcome gift in our room for our little girl including nappies in her size, toiletries and a cuddly hippo which she loved. The staff were also very knowledgable on the local area and were happy to book tickets for us so we didn't have to queue, or recommend a local tapas bar for dinner.

Thank you to everyone at the Serras for a fantastic stay, when we visit Barcelona again we will definitely be back :)",5,2016,09,05
18,Unforgettable experience at the very heart of the city,"We stayed one night only but we felt the hotel was as hospitable and welcoming as home, though at the same time experiencing a highly exclusive and sophisticated environment. We really loved its unique aesthetics and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful since the check-in process. The hotel is located in the gothic quarter which easily provides access to the historical centre of the city. Our room, a Junior Suite with views on the port, was exquisitely designed as well as totally comfortable in all sorts. We also had a great time relaxing at the rooftop bar with a dip in the pool and a panoramic view of the marina.",5,2016,09,04
18,Love love love!!,"I never thought I'd find myself at a hotel with only 28 rooms, but after reviewing the hotel's website, the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and most importantly the hotel's location, I knew I wanted to book.  I did, and I don't regret the decision at ALL.  

I thought I would give a list of the things I LOVED about this hotel.  

1.  The pre-arrival correspondence with the staff.  So helpful, timely and professional in their recommendations/assistance. 
2.  The incredibly warm welcome/check-in experience by ALL the staff from the minute we got out of the cab.  Don't forget the delicious cava, which was presented beautifully.    
3.  Being given a tour of the hotel by one of the hotel managers. And then a tour of our room by another different manager.  Wow, such a personal touch.      
4.  The decor of the hotel, every inch of it.  The decor of the room.  
5.  The scent of the lobby.  The shampoo/shower gel provided.  
6.  The water pressure in the shower. (I know it sounds like a small thing, but it was one of the best I've experienced in any hotel.)
7.  The gorgeous rooftop, its enchanting views and the evening vibe.  
8.  Breakfast
9.  The location.  Pretty much unbeatable.  
10.  A genuine farewell when we left the hotel.  You can see they value the guests patronage.
11.  Of course, the staff.  A group of truly friendly, welcoming, warm, sincere and helpful people.  Every interaction was a pleasure. Nothing was too much.  

My list isn't nearly long enough, but all in all, this hotel provided an exceptional experience.   My only mistake was not staying longer.  If you are coming in for a cruise, like we did, do yourself a favor and stay longer than just one or two nights.  I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Barcelona.",5,2016,09,03
18,Weekend break,"Wonderful time. Great service. Comfortable room. Close to city attractions, marina and beaches.  Staff very friendly, left us feeling that they took a real pleasure in making our stay as enjoyable as possible. 
Restaurant well worth a visit. Breakfast also good.",5,2016,09,03
18,Absolutely perfect ,What a lovely small hotel. From the greetings with bubbles on arrival to the dinner and cocktails in the evening it was perfect. You have to meet Sandra at breakfast who even went out in her lunchtime to get me tomato juice. She really is the epitome of hospitality management and deserves special mention. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.,5,2016,09,03
18,Really friendly boutique hotel - stay here!,"You would be mad to stay anywhere else in central Barcelona. Lovely boutique hotel , super rooms, genuinely friendly and helpful staff and a very convenient location. Refreshing plunge pool on the roof with super views.
We stayed 4 nights and if you find foreign cities occasionally  a bit stressful then this haven is for you.",5,2016,09,02
18,Elegance in the Perfect Location,"This property has all the requirements to satisfy the discerning traveller. Situated on the edge of the marina and a short stroll to La Rambla it provides an oasis of calm in a bustling city. 
The suite was spacious, clean and very well appointed. 
The rooftop bar and pool was the ideal place to wind up a day of touring and shopping.
The staff were extremely professional and displayed a genuine pride in their hotel. Their advice was both informative and helpful.
This small hotel certainly deserves its place as one of the best in a city where quality is renowned.",5,2016,08,31
18,Perfect hotel,"We had a wonderful time at The Serras. The hotel itself is fantastic - great rooftop pool and bar area, very clean and comfortable room, perfect location for the Gothic area and the harbour - but what sticks in our mind is the people. The staff truly go the extra mile and are particularly friendly and welcoming. Looking forward to our next trip already.",5,2016,08,30
18,"Excellent hotel in every dimension , exactly hat you are looking for.","This hotel is in the perfect location. The Gothic area is by far the hippest place to be in Barcelona. It also near the water so it has views and a fantastic off shore breeze. Their rooftop bar is How we ended every evening,with cava for my darling wife and mezcal for me. 
Staff extends themselves to make your stay not good , not great but excellent. 
Beautiful rooms , the most luxurious bed and a shower I wish I had and I just remodeled my home in California. Free wifi, of course.
Hip, helpful and happening. They have an excellent restaurant in the hotel as well.
Loved it.
",5,2016,08,28
18,"Flawless, Elegant, Modern Warmth- Perfection in Barcelona","I spent three nights this summer at this new and very distinguished entrant into the saturated and mostly unexceptional Barcelona hotel scene. As an unabashed 'hotel snob', extensively travelled, I like to try new hotels in the cities I visit to be in the know and sometimes to find that proverbial ""crack in the armor"". I enjoy great hotels (think Andaz, London; Okura Prestige, Bangkok) where the service goes a step beyond the expected and the hotel anticipates needs you dont even know you have yet. These are a rare find.

After almost cancelling my trip due to illness, I fortunately arrived at The Serras with my partner. Located off a scenic but busy street, the moment one walks in, you are in a different world; met with warm yellows, browns and gold's and intimate but not airy lobby, with welcoming scents and actual smiling associates. I loved the two guys who were on concierge - forgot the names, but what seemed like authentic smiles and warmth- could not do enough for you! They all spoke flawless English and seemed to me like well traveled and informed people who loved their roles at the hotel. Dont recall their names, but they were the coolest guys!  I can say this about just about everyone I met!

They welcomed us with glasses of champagne, which were refilled and seated us for check in. They were, of course, expecting us.  Diego, the front desk manager was great...super professional and detailed, the hotel manager Ona Matas, was unbelievable. First of all, Ona (somehow) knew the details of who I was and my correspondence with the hotel and made sure she introduced herself. Throughout my stay she would check in with us and recommended a restaurant which became the favorite for us (called La Cuina D'en Garriga ) check it out! Also, I would see her every day of our stay, at the pool greeting guests and checking on service, in the hotel restaurant and in the lobby. She is herself, a very worldly and clearly accomplished hotelier but with exceptional warmth and a real interest in the comfort and happiness of her guests.

The room itself was the quintessential modern but ultra comfortable 'pied a terre' in Barcelona, with impossibly high design values including tasteful colors and a small terrace, as well as luxurious bath and body products. We were greeted in the room as well, with a bottle of champagne and written welcome note! To be honest, we didnt ever want to leave the room and had to force ourselves out to see Barcelona! The hallways with equally tasteful, quiet....I loved the white walls, broken with accents of color, wood and tall ceilings.  Everywhere smelled really nice- not overpowering, but like something you want even more of!

We loved the rooftop bar and pool, which you can read about on any review of Barcelona rooftop pools. High service values, great drinks and food, not too many sun beds, but we never had any problem. There is a separate seating area if you want to eat, and pool is reserved only for guest use, which I like. While people can come to the rooftop bar from outside on evenings, I never felt it too crowded or distasteful. The hotel and bar itself, draws a low key and sophisticated but 'non snooty' crowd. Our favorite bartender was the Belgian lady at the bar- she was awesome- could multi task like crazy and so sweet and warm! We loved her!

Breakfast is superlative. We fell in love with Sandra, one of the wait staff there....Sandra is like the friend you wish you had- such real warmth, curiosity, over and beyond in terms of her kindness and professionalism. Serras is really fortunate to have people like her. I think 'authentic' is the word for her. We looked forward to seeing Sandra every morning and really miss her! (tears). She remembered what I wanted each day, which is a way to my heart. Also, food is flawlessly presented and plated...even a bowl of fruit looks magical and delicious. We will be back for sure and couldn't recommend this place highly enough. Of course, its not super cheap, but actually-for what you get-very much worth it.

In an industry where even some of the so called 'best hotels' are missing the mark in terms of understanding and anticipating their customer, The Serras, is doing something truly exceptional, hard to do and innovative. Don't even think- just stay here! I stayed here for a romantic weekend, but would choose for business too or as a solo traveler. You wont ever regret it and it will be hard to leave!:)",5,2016,08,28
18,MAGNIFICENT HOTEL!,"We recently stayed at The Serras Hotel before boarding a cruise. ( the location was perfect since it was only a 5 minute ride to the cruise port.)

We were greeted by Diego Altamira- the Reception Manager. He was wonderful! All the reception staff have the best attitude, with big smiles on their faces.

We had corresponded with Isabel in advance to ask many questions and we were lucky that she was there when we arrived. 

The hotel is stunning and immaculate. The rooms are furnished beautifully and the luxurious  bedding was so comfortable. Every amenity that you would possibly need is in the room. 

The breakfast buffet  was fabulous with a great assortment.  You can also order anything off the menu too. Make sure it is included in your hotel package. 

We also had dinner in the hotel restaurant and  that was outstanding.

The service at The Serras is  some of the best of all my years of travelling.  They just want to please you and make your stay very special.There is a reason this hotel is rated so high on Trip Advisor.

 It is in a great location- right next to the Gothic Quarter.

 How do I describe this hotel- MAGNICIFENT, FABULOUS and  OUTSTANDING! If you are looking for a  hotel in Barcelona, with impeccable service, and a beautiful environment then The Serras  is for you!",5,2016,08,28
18,Spectacular,"This was my first trip to Barcelona and the hotel team made sure each detail and experience was top notch.   The hotel was perfectly appointed with beautiful details, comfortable beds, spectacular views, and wonderful service.  The location was perfectly situated near the sites as well as quaint older neighborhoods.  I can't wait to plan my next trip.  I highly recommend this hotel for the solo traveler or couple. ",5,2016,08,28
18,2 Days in Barcelona made even better,"From my phone booking to our greeting on arrival ,the attention to detail was exceptional,even down
to putting spare nappies in the room for my 2 yr old grandaughter (correct size)
The staff were great. We would certainly stay there again when we return to Barcelona.",5,2016,08,25
18,Excellent boutique hotel in a convenient location,"The Hotel Serras offers a wonderful vantage point from which to explore Barcelona.  The property, the beautiful rooftop pool overlooking the old port, the attentive staff and the wonderful cuisine made for a fabulous vacation.  Of note, the junior suite is perfect for a family of three.",5,2016,08,24
18,Well done,"My wife chose this boutique hotel for us on our visit to Barcelona. It's an excellent hotel. 

It's located round the corner from La Ramblas, facing the Marina, which affords great views (if you're at the front) but also puts you smack in the middle of tourist central at peak season (that bothers some people). 

The staff were friendly and helpful. Service was prompt and efficient most of the time. The food was passable but we didn't try the hotel restaurant, who's executive chef has earned a Michelin star in the past, apparently. 

The rate was reasonable considering the location, but worth noting the same rate could have got us a room at The Majestic, which is a LHW. Also worth noting that we'd much rather stay at Serras than W, which is much more and lacks character and soul. 

All in all, a good experience. ",5,2016,08,23
18,Best hotel experience,"This is the first review ever for me to write, but after our stay at The Serras we knew we had to do one. 

We just came back from our honeymoon in Barcelona. 

When we arrived the reception manager Diego told us that he had upgraded us to the hotel suite on the 5th floor, this wonderful gesture made us so happy and thankful, and the room was one of the best we have ever stayed in. 

A bathtub right in front of one of the balconys, stunning marina view, an amazingly comfortable bed and fantastic bathroom. 
Also, a bottle of cava, some tapas and a nice and personal note from the staff. 

Everything was very clean and fresh and the interior is beautiful throughout the whole hotel. 

The food on the rooftop was amazing (the tuna was perfect) and the rooftop pool was very nice. 

Will definately stay here the next time we are in Barcelona! 

Thank you so much for wonderful service and an overall amazing experience! 

",5,2016,08,22
18,Fantastic in all respects,"This hotel is fantastic,the staff are friendly,helpful and competent,The food in the restaurant is excellent and service good.We stayed for 3 days recently and would definitely stay again. The reception staff without exception were incredible",5,2016,08,22
18,UBER GOOD.......I am writing this lying here on the roof terrace sipping Sangria at the Serras,I am lucky enough to have stayed in some of the best hotels in the world and this is in my top five. The staff and service are the best I have come across.In my opinion the hotel standards are Michelin star standard. I can not fault this hotel. Just book it. The pics don't do it justice. The food is exceptional. Location perfect. I wouldn't come here with my kids but I wouldn't go anywhere else in Barcelona as a couple. We will be back. The personal level of care is uber. Well done The Serras ... UBER GOOD!!!,5,2016,08,20
18,Final destination after 10 day cruise.,"Perfect way to end a 10 day trip around Meditarinean. Took advantage of both their Foodie package and Picaso tour. Both were a lot of fun. Food was superb. Staff was super friendly and helpful.  Great roof top bar, lovely way to end each day looking at city lights with beverage of your choice.",5,2016,08,20
18,Best vacation,The staff are helpful. Room was fabulous and location great! Food was spectacular in the restaurant. Loved it and would highly recommend this hotel! We enjoyed the hotel and everything about Barcelona! The rooms were superior. Clean and contemporary ,5,2016,08,19
18,Outstanding Boutique Hotel,"I can not fault Hotel The Serras. My wife and I stayed here for the first few nights of our honeymoon and had a terrific time. The location is perfect, situated in the gothic quarter and close to the port.

The staff are amazing, the service and assistance we were afforded was second to none, no task was too big or small. The rooms were outstanding, well sized, the bed was outrageously comfortable and a lot of nice touches thrown in.

We had one breakfast and one dinner at 'Informal', the hotel restaurant and were very impressed, lovely fresh food in a relaxed environment. The rooftop pool and bar are also a must!

Excellent, highly recommended.",5,2016,08,18
18,perfection!,"Stayed for two nights in August with family. Had wonderful interconnecting rooms at the front of the hotel so had views of the marina and brilliant views. 
We all loved this hotel and we will return. The staff were professional and friendly and incredibly helpful. The food in the restaurant was beautifully cooked and staff were happy to provide dishes off menu for the children. 
The location is brilliant- we were able to walk easily to Las Rambla and around the Gothic Quarter. We took taxis to other sights as its a long walk for small legs. 
The hotel was a true oasis in a hot city and sitting by the pool on the roof was very calming.",5,2016,08,18
18,a little gem,"A beautiful hotel, with first rate staff, this is proper 5 star hotel and experience from start to finish. The room was beautiful, the bed the most comfortable i have every slept on in a hotel, the rooftop bar and the wonderful breakfast. Cant wait to go back.",5,2016,08,15
18,Such a nice place!,"Just love the vibe and atmosphere of a small luxurius, jet casual hotel in the middle of a vibrant city.

Especially impressed by the leasure of the rooftop terrase. Great tappas, great drinks.

The room is rather small, but well done and functional, with nice little details.
",5,2016,08,10
18,Boutique Hotel Haters Take Note! The Serras is Different (in a good way),"I'm not usually a fan of boutique hotels. My typical experience with many of them is that they are built with a first impression in mind and they usually grow on me in a negative way over the course of my stay. The Serras is the opposite of this. It's really a great hotel in a fantastic location with a warm staff who seem to really care about the place.

The rooms are beautiful, really well appointed with comfortable beds, great bed sheets, etc. I could go on and on but my take home message here is that everything is really high quality. Someone actually thought this through and decided to entrust hotel guests with good stuff! :)

But while the hotel is nice, it's the staff that really bring the place to life and define the personality and service level of the hotel. From check in to check out, even after check out when we went to retrieve our bags, we felt the warmth and knowledge of every member of the staff. 

I can go into great detail about the stay and if I write enough I'm sure I can come up with something to sort of complain about, but bottom line is, great hotel, great location, superb staff, well designed and conceived room layouts. 

We will definitely be back!",5,2016,08,09
18,The perfect spot!,"I had a two night stay here on my way to Mallorca. I found the hotel via Internet search for boutique hotels. The location and views are fabulous. Cool roof top bar and pool, great team working in the hotel and excellent rooms with wonderful bed and amenities. ",5,2016,08,07
18,Better than expected ,"After reading all the trip advisor reviews I couldn't wait to arrive. What an amazing hotel. Our room was perfect! The location is amazing and we loved touring barcelona from this area. Close enough to everything and metro or taxis easily accessible. 

The hotel music in lifts and bar areas was fantastic! The roof top bar is perfect for lying at the pool or having a few glasses of cava 😀😀 

I feel special mention needs to be made to Daniel who went out of his way to help us with restaurants for breakfast,lunch and dinner and they were all superb and just what we were looking for. 

We can't wait to return  and would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona. ",5,2016,08,06
18,FANTASTC,"The Serras is a small 28 room, one year old, family owned and run luxury boutique hotel of the highest quality.  Apparently the family gutted this very old building and built the hotel in the shell with great care to detail.  Picasso has painted in this property so it has a history to it.  We were met at the curb by the reception manager and inside the lobby by the general manager.  We were promptly served Cava and OJ which was amazing. We felt comfortable and immediately welcome as if they had been waiting for us....well they were because we had arranged with the hotel to provide a Mercedes Sprint van and driver to meet us at the airport and bring us to the hotel.  Extremely well done, although there are plenty of taxis.

We have traveled the World and this was one of our best hotel experiences ever.  Our room, 404 was a small suite with sofa and a small balcony.  Pastries were served with turn down service.  The rooms were high tech, completely modern and gorgeous...but small which is just fine. The bed and linens were excellent as were the toiletries and the bottle of Cava in the room.

Now for the really good part: The ten table restaurant called Informal is just that: and the food is amazing.  The chef is a Michelin chef and the food is fantastic.  The included breakfast is the best we have ever eaten. The Club Sandwich for lunch is over the tip with a hot fried egg in it.  Wonderful!  Veal Filet for dinner was excellent as was the goat.

They have a small roof terrace with tiny pool, bar and tapas service which overlooks the harbor. Lovely.   You will love this hotel.  I am uncommonly effusive about it, but in a city as insanely busy as it was last week as August holidays in Europe began, Serras was an Oasis.   You cannot ask for more.  It was wonderful and our thanks from my son and daughter and my wife and I.  This is a successful family business that we will return to for sure.  My son and his wife did the research on this property and nailed it.   Comfortable, intimate and relaxing.",5,2016,08,03
18,beautiful boutique hotel in the heart of Barcelona,"WOW!  This hotel was quite a find!  We had an absolutely wonderful visit in this beautiful city.  We arrived and were greeted with champagne, fresh OJ, and cold water.  Check in was easy.  We literally had not planned anything for our trip (last minute and my husband planned so I wasn't involved!) and the concierge planned and arranged everything for us while we sat with her in the lobby sipping champagne.  She made recommendations and then booked a bike tour, dinner for all 3 nights, and tickets to tour the Sagrada Familia the next day.  The room was perfect-modern, clean, spacious, and had all the amenities we could want.  We were surprised with more champagne and desserts in celebration of my birthday waiting in our room.  Everything about this hotel was fantastic- the service, breakfasts in the morning, the terrace with a pool, bar, and gorgeous views, and the location.  Easy walk or taxi everywhere.  We loved our stay.  Would like to thank everyone personally for making our stay so enjoyable-the front desk, concierge, and belllman staff are truly excellent.  We will definitely return.",5,2016,08,01
18,Premier boutique hotel in Barcelona,"After spending four nights at the Serra's I'd be hard pressed to think there would be a better lodging choice in Barcelona.  This beautifully appointed small hotel is perfectly situated between the Gothic quarter and the beach.  Somewhat unassuming from the outside on the busy Passeig de Colom, the hotel is quiet, cool and intimate on the inside.  A great escape for us from the heat of the city during the day. As advertised, the service and staff at the hotel is professional, helpful and friendly. Think the best Ritz Carlton without the overly formal demeanor.

Our room was beautifully appointed and while not expansive, it was perfectly laid out and very functional.  We had a room with a view which made it extra nice and despite the busy street outside the room was both quite and dark for sleeping.  The rooftop bar was the place for cocktails each night as the view, service and vibe is something you shouldn't miss.  We had dinner one night and breakfast two morning at Il Informal and all meals were exceptional.  Fantastic service and the meals were world class.  You literally have to force yourself not to eat a second meal at the hotel the food was so good.

Overall The Serra's is the first place we would consider on a return to Barcelona.  I would not think you would have a better option if you're looking for a beautiful place to stay without compromise.",5,2016,07,31
18,Just chilling,"Look after the little sign just outside the hotel ""visit our rooftop"" it's an absolut must try for every feinsmaker. You will not be disappointed this terrasse bar is stunning. Service is quick, nice and absolutly appriciated. Just the view over the harbour is worth your while. Absolutly one of our new favorit places. Thanks for your exclusivity and hospitalty",5,2016,07,31
18,location location,My wife and I had the privilege of staying at this property this July.  The location is unbeatable; the staff is incredibly accommodating and the rooms are very comfortable.  From our first encounter at the check in desk to our departure we have nothing but superlatives about this property.  We arrived late in the day and asked for a recommendation for a restaurant within walking distance. The front office staff recommend and made a reservation for us at Llamber.  We had an incredible meal that started our European vacation.  One of the best experiences overall in our traveling career.,5,2016,07,24
18,Beautiful Roof Top Bar,"We came across The Serras Hotel whilst out walking and noticed it had a roof top bar. We said we would definitely come back in the evening and we did. 
Whenever you walked in the front reception area of the hotel, there was a beautiful fresh smell. The receptionist was very welcoming. She pointed us over to the elevator Talgarth would take up to the roof top bar. When we got up there it was a little piece of tranquil heaven.
We were only wanting cocktails and they did not disappoint. They were a little pricy but well worth it considering the area and the good views. The waiters were very attentive. Took some photographs of the place. Would definitely go back again.",5,2016,07,23
18,25th Wedding Anniversary Chris and Theresa,"Thanks to all the staff for making our 25th Wedding Anniversary so special. The staff were attentive, helpful , knowledgably and just couldn't do enough for us. The customer service was impeccable. The food was outstanding. Location of hotel was great and the roof top terrace/ bar had great atmosphere and great views across the harbour. Rooms were modern with  great facilities, Thanks too for the complimentary champagne, chocolates and selection of goodies and free drinks and for organising trips and taxis.
Wow  a hidden gem in Barcelona what a memorable anniversary we wont forget x.",5,2016,07,23
18,Excellent!,"We are a family of four, children ages 11 &13, and we spent three wonderful nights in two grand deluxe connecting rooms.  First, the service at this hotel is impeccable.  There is always someone to help you with anything, reservations, transportation, general questions, etc., even before you arrive.  Our rooms were spacious and lovely.  We were on the fifth floor overlooking the harbor.  There were small FC Barcelona gifts waiting for the children on their beds when we arrived, which they loved!  We were also greeted with a glass of cava or fresh squeezed orange juice and a small snack.  The location was great. The hotel is close to the busy Gothic Quarter and the beaches and a Metro Stop.  We loved the rooftop bar and pool.  It was a great place to have a before or after dinner drink. The pool, although it is small, was very refreshing after spending the day walking around in the heat.  We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to others and would stay here again ourselves!",5,2016,07,21
18,Five Stars All Around,"Great location as next to the enchanting Gothic Quarter with it's old world narrow streets, stores and restaurants, yet also in walking distance to the Ramblas and the beach and boardwalk which was great. Amazing customer service a la Four Seasons level. Great size, as intimate with less than 30 rooms so very personable. Incredible rooftop terrace with great views of the city and ocean in distance, and the most surreal and beautiful small swimming pool I have ever been in as all stainless steel - we enjoyed coming here to unwind and relax after walking around all day.  We also found our room to be very quiet with full black out blinds - both details we appreciated due to the jet lag our first few nights. 
This boutique hotel is in the more higher range price wise, however we did walk away feeling very satisfied and would highly recommend. I have a passion for hotel design and  stopped into a number of other boutique hotels in the area and was very pleased with our choice.",5,2016,07,21
18,Amazing location and personalized service,"This place was amazing.  They greeted us by name as we got out of the taxi in front of this luscious boutique hotel nestled in the heart of the Barri Gotic and right across from the water.  The room was modern and well-appointed, although a little on the small side, but the personal touches more than made up for that.  We had a lovely tapas tray and cold cava waiting for us.  The bed was SO comfortable.  The staff was so helpful, offering restaurant suggestions, reservations, and even booking our tickets for the Sagrada Familia.  The rooftop pool deck had an amazing view of the water, and we launched our sightseeing adventures up through the alleys of the Gothic Quarter just outside the door of the hotel.  Highly recommend this place if you'd like to feel special and welcome.",5,2016,07,19
18,Wonderful!,"Beautiful hotel, great  location and top-notch staff! When I arrived I was offered water and a glass of cava. The room was very modern and The bed was comfortable. The area  which the hotel is located felt very safe to walk alone in the evening. It was a very pleasant stay.",5,2016,07,19
18,Beautiful Stay,"one hotel with wonderful service from start to the end, my wife enjoyed the stay so muc we will be coming back next year. thank you for a wonderful stay specially the young guy on the desk. he was a epitome when it comes to service standards.",5,2016,07,13
18,Incredible Find,"Your experience starts at The Hotel Serras as soon as you arrive at the door. Plenty of staff are on hand from the very beginning to assist and our arrival was welcomed with a bottle of Cava and a one on one tour of the hotel with one of their staff. Instantly we felt at home. During this time they also took the time to find out why we were there and recommend some locations/restaurants based on our preferences and needs. This was fantastic and it seemed everything was taken care of for us without us even having to ask. 
The rooms are stunning, and the fit out is modern and comfortable. We utilized the nespresso machine in our room everyday and my husband ordered from the pillow menu. It had everything you would expect from a 5 Star hotel. 
The hotel only has 28 rooms so it feels cosy and personal which we really liked. It also has a rooftop pool and bar which we ended up spending 2 days at! It is only a very small pool but is perfect for a quick dip while sitting in the Barcelona heat. There were probably only a couple of other couples up there each time we were there so it was never hard to get a seat or felt too crowded.
My only criticism of the hotel would be the gym. We always choose hotels with gyms when we travel and this one was a bit of a let down. It had two pieces of cardio equipment, some dumbbells and resistance bands. When we got there one morning there was someone on the treadmill and as it is a very small room we struggled to fit in. The weights also only went up to 10kg, so were not heavy enough for my husband. However, this is not enough to lower my 5 star rating of the hotel, it is just worth noting if you were hoping to get a workout in on your visit!",5,2016,07,12
18,Exceptional,"The food, the decor, the staff, the rooms were all outstanding. Everything we needed was there before we asked for it. All the staff were professional, happy and knowledgable. I could not fault it. Will certainly stay here if in Barcelona again.",5,2016,07,10
18,Incredible!,Me and my father had an amazing time at the serras. The staff had an incredible knowledge of the city and were very accomodating. The hotel itself is perfectly located in the Gothic quarter right near to the food markets and many beautiful sights. Would recommend staying here. ,5,2016,07,10
18,Perfect stay,"This is one of the best places we have ever stayed. Clean, nice, modern. The staff are super friendly and helpful. Made dinner reservations for us at amazing spots every night. The pool is beautiful. If we have any negatives, it's that the restaurant Informal was nothing special. Location is great too, easy walking to most things you would like to see/do.  They really went above and beyond to help us have an enjoyable stay in Barcelona. ",5,2016,07,10
18,What's not to like?,"I have a three days trip to Barcelona as part of my long vacation and decided to stay at the Serras over the Mandarin Oriental despite the recommendation of my travel agent for the latter. Reason being the Serras got good reviews in Tripadvisor and also seems a better value than the Mandarin and has slightly larger rooms for the price. 

Arrival

I booked a car pickup from hotel and other than the initial traffic jam, the ride was pleasant. On arrival, I was warmly greeted by name and did a sit down check-in. The General Manager of the hotel Mr Antonio also greeted me and wished me a good stay. One of the reception staff than lead me to the room for check-in and introduce the room  features. 	

The Junior Suite

I booked a Junior Suite which is the more spacious room category. There are actually two kind of Junior Suite, one with a view and one without. Mine doesn’t have a view at all as it faced the wall of the neighboring building. For privacy reason, it is then necessary to draw up the curtains all the times. The room has double-galzed windows which means it’s literally whisper quiet. 

The room is decorated in a modern contemporary style and neatly divided into a living and sleeping quarters. The bed is reportedly having won some prestigious awards as best bed in Europe as I am told. In reality, it’s rather too soft for my liking but still comfortable. The bathroom is very nice. Overhead shower is strong and there is even a Jacuzzi tub. Only issue I have is that the Jacuzzi tub is very difficult to operate. Even the hotel staff that came to my room to show me how to operate took a few tries before it got it working. However, once it worked, it is a pleasure to use as the air bubbles are not just on the side but from below as well and is very relaxing. The accompanying toiletries ( I forgotten the name ) are very nice as well. 

Location and Common Areas

As mentioned earlier, the hotel is a boutique hotel with only 28 rooms. Yet, it manages to have a Michelin-starred rated restaurant, a small mezzanine level lobby, an outdoor terrace with plunge pool and even a gym, faculties that are often missing in European boutique hotels of this size. The location is also great. It’s only 10 mins walk to Las Ramblas and about 15 to 20 mins walk to the city centre of Piazza Catalunya. The seafront location is great as well and the hotel is surrounded by eateries and restaurants. I tried some of the outside food and were disappointed except one and in the end decided that the hotel’s own restaurant Informal served the best food with an extensive menu and there was no need for me to venture outside and risk eating bad food again. I had two meals there and also morning breakfast and they will all great. The breakfast in the morning has some of the best selection of cured meats and cheese I have tasted in my travels. They even have champagne! My only gripe is that breakfast starts too late at 8AM and on several occasions, I have to rush thru some of them in order to be on time for my tours which usually start in the morning to avoid the peak hour crowds. 

Service 

Service is great at the Serras. Everyone is helpful and attentive and always do so with a smile. The staff take the effort to interact with guests as well. Also, the guest relationship staff, who also double as a concierge and they helped me to arrange my sight-seeing itinerary even before I checked-in. I was always greeted by name and staff remember my preferences, which makes me feel special staying there. The included amenities are also very generous during my stay including welcome package of wine, champagne, chocolates and more. And when I call to request for anything or for housekeeping to service the room, they come literally in minutes. 

Conclusion

Really, what is there not to like? The Serras is such a well-run hotel that I have to nit-pick in order to find fault with it. OK, the Jacuzzi tub is kind of hard to operate. There is no view in my room ( but that can be addressed in future by booking a sea-view room ) and I wish the breakfast can start earlier. Other than that, nothing. For a person as fussy as me, the Serras did a marvelous job. I am pleased to award it my rare 5/5 top rating, which is exclusively for hotels that are exceptionally well run and close to perfection.",5,2016,07,10
18,Perfect!,"Stayed for three nights in the beginning of July. Mercer Hotel was full, and The Serras looked like the obvious alternative: Same size (just under 30 rooms), rooftop bar and pool, modern decor, high level of service.

Now, not so sure Mercer is at the top of my Barcelona hotel list anymore. And I loved Mercer.

Pros:
- Service. Second to none. For instance: On arrival, the concierge suggested Bodega 1900 for dinner. They were fully booked all three nights, but she insisted on giving it a go anyway. Thursday afternoon, a call from the reception confirmed a table at ""Bodega 1900"". Half an hour later, another call to ask if we might want to switch to at table at ""Tickets""? Mind you, ""Tickets"" is fully booked two months in advance. I don't know what ""special occasion""-strings were pulled, but we had an amazing time that same night, including an unforgettable finale in the fable Dessert Room.
- The rooftop. The stainless steel pool is small (thought larger than, say, that of the DO Reial), but perfectly placed and with a built-in-bench. The bar doesn't disappoint, either. We were never alone when tanning or having drinks, but, crucially, the place never felt crowded at all.
- The room: The Grand Deluxe room, 405, has a small balcony facing Carrer de la Plata, the quiet sidestreet leading towards the Barri Gotic-quarter. For the price, Mercer offers larger rooms, DO Reial smaller. The bathroom is quite large, though, with a very roomy rain shower.
- Breakfast: Buffet with a choice of one made-to-order-dish, like eggs or crepes, or a la carte. Coffee or tea, juice, a pastry basket and fruit salad is served at your table, even with the buffet. Three chefs at work in the kitchen.
Wifi: Free.

Cons:
None. Well, the gym is tiny and as a consequence, not that well stocked. But hey, bring your running shoes and go for a run along the water after sunset.",5,2016,07,09
18,New World Exquisite amidst Old World Charm,"Charming and accommodating arrival, refreshing drinks, an informed concierge and a lovely room with a balcony view to the harbor.  The bathroom was gorgeous with a fabulous shower, great lighting and plenty of hanging space for towels, clothes and robes.  And you know what, we were able to get an ironing board and iron for our entire 4 night stay ... something we failed to find in most hotels across Europe.  The restaurant ""Informal"" was where we breakfasted each morning; try the eggs poached in potato cream ... utterly delicious.  We dined in the restaurant on our first evening and had exquisite food prepared under the stewardship on 1 Star Michelin chef Marc Gascons.  The concierge was able to recommend 7 fabulous tapas and pintxos bars within walking distance of the hotel and that made our second night a wonderful trawl around the alleys and laneways off La Rambla.",4,2016,07,07
18,Elegant boutique hotel at a very good location,"You can note the quality on arrival and in every detail from that time on. A  surprise welcomes you at room  with  an excellent  bed and pillows providing marvellous sleep quality.Room also have elegant bathroom with brilliant shower and jacuzzi. 
 Informal restaurant was  excellent and  breakfast was delicious.",5,2016,07,07
18,Great Small Hotel,"Just spent 3 days here to close out a trip to Spain. 

Amazing service and a great little hotel....literally zero complaints. We will definitely return and were very depressed to leave! 

My only recommendation would be to try and increase the size of the gym....
",5,2016,07,05
18,Lovely hotel well located,"The Serras is an excellent hotel. The service makes this a great experience. The rooms are spacious for a hotel in the old city and well appointed. The shower in our room had a special device to add moisturizing oil to the water, very nice. The bed was really comfortable.The wifi is strong throught the hotel. The excersise room is small but adequate. We enjoyed the second floor bar and the rooftop lounge. The breakfast buffet and selection of hot items was more than adequate to begin a day of Barcelona site seeing. The hotel service was very personal. The staff had wonderful suggestions and were helpful with everything, activities, restaraunts suggestions, laundry and any special requests. We would definelty choose this hotel again if we are fortunate to returno Barcelona and will recommend it to others",5,2016,07,05
18,Wow Wow Wow the best service ever,"The staff are fantastic at this small boutique hotel in a great location. On arrival you do not stand at reception waiting to check in you are seated in the lobby given a glass of Cava and they come to you. You are then shown around the hotel and told everything you need to know.

The room although small ( we had the cheapest rooms ) was great with a large bathroom and brilliant shower. The bed was the best I had stayed in and the pillows fantastic.

We checked in early and spent the day by the pool on the roof top. The pool is small but has great views over the marina and we were the only guests up there, with what seemed like our own waiter just for us. The cocktails were very delicious.

The icing on the cake was a bottle of Cava and Tapas in our room when we arrived.

Diago one of the managers was great giving us brilliant recommendation for restaurants and Daniel was very informative about how to get to places.

I really enjoyed our 3 days and will return again and try the restaurant which we did not have time to visit..",5,2016,07,05
18,"Ideal Location, Great Design Hotel","Loved the location of Hotel The Serras.  The staff are attentive and friendly.  Very helpful.  The hotel is small which is wonderful.  On the edge of the Gothic and Born districts and the waterfront, the location is perfect for exploring Barcelona by foot.  The hotel is beautifully designed and appointed.  We had a spacious room overlooking the marina.  Would definitely return.",5,2016,07,01
18,Fantastic hotel,"We loved our stay at the The Serras Hotel. Excellent location in Gothic Quarter but on the harbour side so doesn't feel claustrophobic. Very sincere, professional and personable service by the staff and management team. Lovely decor. Would highly recommend!",5,2016,06,30
18,Excellent Hotel,Stayed here for 3 nights with my daughter in late June. Extremely comfortable and well appointed hotel in great location in walking distance to most locations you need to visit. Staff couldn't be more helpful. Very professional and very nice welcome on arrival. Excellent buffet breakfast.,5,2016,06,27
18,Boutique goodness,"My wife and I stayed 5 nights here and we loved the hotel and the staff was also noteworthy. The property is small at under 30 rooms and located overlooking the marina. Our room (205) was standard European size, well furnished with an exceptionally comfortable mattress. We made daily use of the roof terrace but don't plan to swim in the pool for exercise - it's tiny! Breakfast is very good but at 5* prices there are equally good local alternatives at a fraction of the cost. There is a small fitness room which we used a few times but the space and equipment here is extremely limited. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples - not sure how suitable it would be for families with young children.",5,2016,06,22
18,This hotel will take some beating,"We stayed at The Serras during May and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The hotel is centrally located and has a modern sophisticated feel. We had a junior suite which was well appointed with all the features you would expect from a luxury hotel. The headboard of the bed was placed along the centre of the room and formed a divider between the sitting and sleeping areas. Both areas had a tv and a balcony giving views of the Gothic quarter alleyways at the back of the hotel. The bathroom was spacious and complete with a Jacuzzi bath which was very relaxing after a busy day of sightseeing. The wardrobe arrangement was slightly awkward as the wardrobe door when opened blocked access to the room - perhaps a sliding door would have been better. Wifi was free. 

We dined at the restaurant twice and thought the quality of the food, presentation and service was excellent. We also enjoyed the more relaxed friendly style of the roof top bar. The roof top area had good views of the marina and had a small plunge pool and sun loungers as well as the bar and eating areas. 

The hotel position is very good with the Gothic quarter, Marina, beach, cable car terminal, Las Ramblas and the Picasso museum within a ten minute walk. Other attractions such as the Olympic Port and the Gaudi buildings were a little further but still walkable. 

The real stars of The Serras are the staff. The concierge staff were excellent and took time to help us make the most of our visit. They booked us tickets for a classical guitar concert, the Picasso museum and Gaudi's masterpiece the Familia Segrada. They also pulled off a minor miracle by arranging for us a table at the Moments 2 Michelin star restaurant at very short notice. We also enjoyed chatting to the girls in the rooftop bar who found time to ask about our day and our plans for the holiday. 

The house keeping was good and the turn down service included a tasty treat although we were often too full to eat it until the following day. One turn down service was missed during our stay.

Barcelona is certainly a place we would visit again and we would stay at the Serras.",4,2016,06,14
18,Uber Cool with Great Location,"Intimate, hip & modern hotel centrally located to the beach, shopping and the many attractions of Barcelona. The rooms are well appointed and comfy, with luxury amenities from slippers to toiletries. The roof deck has a great view and a chill vibe perfect for a lite bite and a beer, glass of wine, or cocktail to begin or end your day with.  This is truly a luxury hotel, and expect to pay for it- really pay for it. If you are looking for a ""deal"" or are on a tight budget, this is not the place for you. The rooms are great, but they are still rooms. At the Hotel Serras you are paying for superb service, and I mean over the top attentive personal service, attention to detail, location and simple understated luxury. I highly recommend the hotel, to those who can afford it, without reservation.",5,2016,06,08
18,Amazing is not enough,"we spent a short weekend in barcelona back in July 2015 and decided to book the hotel serras. i have to say this was one of the most memorable stays in any hotel i have had so far. the warm welcome, the great desing, the perfect room, the breakfast and the hotel bar or pool everything was just top of the range. the staff is friendly and warm and have exellent tips. the location is great to explore the city by foot.

the serras was so great that we plan our trips to barcelona based on availability of the hotel :-)",5,2016,06,07
18,"Luxurious, Amazing Location, Look nowhere else in Barcelona","in 5 visits and 13 different hotels in Europe, this was by far our best experience.  Amazing location with views of the ocean, great and friendly service, full of amenities.  Rooftop bar with a beautiful view, great restaurant in lobby.  Breakfast service was superb.  Highly recommend",5,2016,06,06
18,Very excellent hotel and fantastic staff,"We would recommend The Serras to everyone.  We had a great 3 night stay.  The hotel, location and staff could not be better.  The rooms are on the small side, but that is European standard. Also, over 3/4's of the rooms have no view - or at least a view of an old building a few feet away.  But the pluses way overcome the minor negatives here.",5,2016,06,04
18,"Fantastic boutique hotel, would highly recommend!!","Extremely modern and made to feel personally welcome from the moment we arrived. Greeted with a glass of fizz on check in and given a guided tour by a member of staff. It was clear all employees were very proud of the hotel and all super friendly. Room was modern and spotless, each evening we arrived back a little bedside treat would have been left i.e. chocolate / dessert. Terrace had the best view, amazing drinks / cocktails. Breakfast was also great.... Cannot fault this hotel. Would definitely return :)",5,2016,06,02
18,Excellent boutique hotel,"Wonderful hotel in a great location. Staff is excellent and will do what it takes to make you satisfied. Very modern interior.  The Informal has amazing food and The Rooftop was our favorite thing. Having a few delicious cocktails with tapas and overlooking the marina will be a highlight memory. I recommend spending the extra money for a junior suite that overlooks the Passeig de Colom and marina. The smaller rooms look into another building, but it is still worth staying there even if you don't choose the suites.",5,2016,06,01
18,I would probably give this a 4.5 out of 5.,"I would have given an excellent but for the price of a ""sea-view junior suite"", I wish we could have actually been able to see the sea.  We were on the 3rd floor and we knew there was a sea on the other side of the trees, but if you book a sea-view, definitely ask to be on a higher floor.  The doorman/bell desk/concierge Daniel was extremely helpful and genuinely kind. The manager Ona was great as well. The room is very upscale, modern and the bed was very comfortable.  We stayed 4 nights and walked every where - along the port, to the old town, up to the shopping areas.  Eat at their restaurant ""Informal"".  Order the green aioli spread with crustini, the potato bravas and the flan.  All delicious!",5,2016,05,30
18,Nice boutique hotel but a bit over-rated,"We stayed here three nights and had a very nice time. As others have all said this is beyond doubt a very nice boutique hotel but we were both a little disappointed relative to the the reviews we have read - given this was rated number 1 on trip adviser. It dint spoil our trip but in my experience of hotels I wouldn't give it five stars and given the high price I think it's no more than average for what they charge. 

The plus points are the location which is just fantastic. Right by the barri gotic, near barceloneta and el born. The room (we had a grand deluxe on fourth floor) was a decent size, easy to control and effective AC, very comfortable bed. Sound-proofing is good given the very noisy road. The rooftop is nice although a bit small and exposed to the wind. On occasions space was limited by use of non-guests which was disappointing. Cocktails were nice and the staff are generally very helpful. The restaurant we found very good (I've reviewed separately) and the chef deserves his Michelin star. 

On the downside the space in the room was not particularly well used. The bathroom was big enough for a bath but it only had a shower, the decor was white and impersonal rather than the warmer more personal feel that is common in a boutique hotel. The whiteness may be an attempt to make the room feel lighter - it was right opposite another building across a narrow street so there was no view and the small balcony was not really useable given the street noise. Although the room was a decent size there was only seating for one person which seemed an odd use of space. I'm sure you can ask for a better room but presumably it will cost more and I would certainly expect more for €500 per night we spent. 

So in summary nice hotel and we enjoyed it but questionable value for money relative to our experiences elsewhere and expectations. Service was good but not as fantastic as other reviews suggest. I'm not surprised it has slipped from the #1 position it held on trip advisor.

18,Outstanding accommodations!,We love this hotel. It's location is perfect-in between the Gothic quarter and Barceloneta. The rooms are small but the space is well utilized. We always like when we have double sinks! The bed is super comfortable. The furnishings are very elegant. The shower was a nice size. We enjoyed our breakfast but a highlight was the rooftop cafe. It started to rain so we sat under the canopy. You must have the patatas bravas. We had them throughout Spain and these were by far the best. The young owner was on the premises and was very helpful. We will definitely return. We can see why this hotel gets great reviews. Well done!,5,2016,05,25
18,Outstanding,"From the very moment you walk in, you can tell something is different about this hotel.  We were greeted immediately and offered coffee as we checked in.  We were surprised with a bottle of chilled cava, charcuterie and sweet pastries waiting for us in the room which was very nicely appointed.  Bathroom and shower were spacious and the bed luxurious.  This boutique hotel only has a total of 28 rooms and the attention to detail shows.  Service from the lobby staff was above and beyond what we expected (They ordered and sent a beautiful bouquet of flowers for us for our local friends and even sent us a picture to confirm the delivery!)  We wish we could have stayed longer and to have tried the restaurant.  We will definitely return to this hotel!",5,2016,05,24
18,Excellent stay at The Serras! Incredible Service & Staff,"My husband and I traveled in Europe for our honeymoon and arrived in Barcelona after a few nights in Monaco. We were both elated with the service and quality of The Serras Hotel. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable and memorable. We were greeted by all staff members and management and overall felt incredibly welcomed. The hotel is very well located, steps away from Las Ramblas and Barceloneta in the Barrio Gotico (Gothic Quarter) area. The hotel design is very beautiful and modern and the rooms are comfortable. The food here is also worth mentioning, from the tapa on the rooftop (try the octopus) to the restaurant onsite, everything was fantastic. We will definitely stay here again next time we visit Barcelona.",5,2016,05,24
18,Really great hotel.,"We stayed there for 4 nights, really excellent : staff, room, cleanliness, restaurant (not that expensive for excellent food). One of the best small hotels we've stayed in, made our trip. We stayed in room 202, lovely and nice views, noisy with windows open, but what do you expect? You won't be disappointed if you stay here. ",5,2016,05,22
18,Exceptional Hotel with Exceptional Staff,"I booked this hotel for my parents for them to spend about a week in Barcelona.  My parents are very particular and fussy about everything from noise to the bed and air conditioning.  The hotel is new and very well done.  The new windows make the rooms very quiet when you don’t want to hear the sounds of the city.  The location is excellent and central to all the good things.  The hotel restaurant is also excellent, but make sure to make a reservation for dinner since it is not large.  The staff is extremely attentive and accommodating and work hard to make sure you are happy and that everything related to your stay goes smoothly.  It is a first class hotel with a small boutique feel.",5,2016,05,22
18,Boutique at it's Best,"My partner & I had a fantastic stay here, the staff were extremely friendly & accommodating, the room, hotel & facilities were top notch, everything you would expect from a boutique hotel.

Be sure to have an afternoon cocktail at the rooftop bar, the view over the boat Harbour is wonderful.",5,2016,05,22
18,Beautiful Boutique Hotel in Perfect Location,"We stayed in a Junior Suite room that was located at the end of the corridor. Our room was spacious, incredibly quiet for the great location and clean. Hotel The Serras is a boutique Hotel opened in January 2015 by a Spanish IT businessman who couldn't find a Barcelona hotel nice enough for his visiting friends.The hotel faces the Mediterranean and outdoor entertainment area of the new harbor area. Behind the hotel is the Gothic Quarter where you can conveniently stop at a bakery for cappuccino, tapas restaurants, drug stores, etc. The Rambles and  the The trendy Born area (Barcelona Cathedral) and a safe, easy ten minute walk. The hotel feels intimate and the amenities are top notch, including the high quality sheets, pillows and delicious bedside night time treats. This hotel is modern and comfortable. The bathroom is spacious and clean. The concierge recommended outstanding restaurants.Our last night in Barcelona, we ate at the hotel restaurant and it was very good. When we were checking out, several staff members accompanied my husband and I to our taxi to say goodbye. Its very unusual to find such personal, unstuffy attention in a large city hotel. I have stayed at the Hotel Arts, which was fine but we were constantly waiting either for taxis due to its location or elevators due to it large size. We also considered staying at the Mandarin Oriental but were glad we chose the Serras after seeing the busy, impersonal Business district where the M.O.is located. I  can highly recommend Hotel The Serras to any upscale traveler.",5,2016,05,21
18,Very good !,Very nice hotel. Excellent service. Great rooms. Super clean and nice. Great variety of food and a very good breakfast. The same it is worth it. Can you reserve and affordable prices. Grade 10 at all. Congratulations.,4,2016,05,21
18,Great Hotel,"We booked The Serras for it's proximity to Port Vell Marina. It's also within walking distance to Las Ramblas - so good location for exploring Barcelona. The staff were amazing. Friendly, polite, efficient and genuinely as guests we felt nothing was too much trouble. The hotel was clean and bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately, our room didn't have a view - wasn't really a problem for us on our trip but maybe disappointing for some. The view from The Rooftop Terrace, however, is fantastic. A great place for a drink and tapas. Sun trap whilst we were there - a few sun loungers plus a plunge pool.
The food was very good - can cater for special dietary requirements. We had breakfast and also dinner (where we were accommodated as a party of seven, despite the restaurant been fully booked) Thank you!  Basic  spa treatments available, plus a mini gym area. For a small hotel they try to offer extra amenities. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely book again.",5,2016,05,21
18,Wonderful Luxury Hotel,"We arrived much later than hoped, very tired from a difficult drive.  However we were met at the kerb, taken in and given a tremendously friendly welcome.  Amazingly the young man then offered to drive my husband to the garage to get fuel in the hire car. What a huge unexpected help which took all the hassle out of it.  Meanwhile the wonderful front of house ladies gave me a drink, a tour of the hotel and took our bags up to a gorgeous room where an anniversary surprise platter of delicious cava and nibbles were waiting - immediate relaxation!

The furnishings, décor, fabulous food in the restaurant, beautiful roof terrace and staff mean that this is a perfect hotel and we cannot wait to return.",5,2016,05,20
18,Great hotel,"Really nice and stylish boutique hotel with very good restaurant. Breakfast was excellent.

The staff try really hard to help you - they gave us some great recommendations for restaurants at reasonable prices. 

Central location, close to old town. ",5,2016,05,19
18,Beautiful hotel,"We arrived late in the afternoon, and we were given a room right away. Everybody was so welcoming and warm hearted. The room was great, the only thing is that it was a bit smaller than expected! Anyway we loved it :)",4,2016,05,16
18,A boutique hotel and model of personalized superior service. ,"We stayed at the Hotel The Serras for a week. Our room was considered a junior suite, although smaller than expected for a 'suite'. But with a balcony on Passeig de Colom, across from the port, on the edge of the Gothic Quarter, it was a perfect location with an great view. The room was appointed with very nice amenities, what you'd expect from a luxury hotel. The bed was super comfortable and the hotel very quiet, since it rained in Barcelona 90% of our stay, that was a very good thing. The most outstanding memory was the personalized service we received from the staff. Every request, even attention you didn't expect, the staff went over and above. The breakfast was great, and of course superb service. ",5,2016,05,13
18,"Delightful Room, restaurant and service","The Serras Hotel is a delightful place to stay. The staff is very helpful, the rooms are beautifully decorated, the beds are very comfortable, the restaurant is delicious and the rooftop patio is a great place to relax. I highly recommend it.",5,2016,05,07
18,Probably best hotel staff in Barcelona,"WOW - such a great boutique hotel, perfectly situated in the Gotic part of Barcelona, with a view to marina, so walking distance to most major downtown attractions.
Rooms are beautifully designed, nice bathroom amenities, including shower oil :) 
Breakfast is great - both the continental and the hot - only thing i missed was musli, but was promised it would be there next time :) 
Ok the roof pool is not the biggest i have seen, but no need - its nice and fits its purpose.

The staff - what can i say except they are amazing - always smiling, ready to help with any question one could have, and no matter time of the day, a big smile back - thanks for a fantastic stay - will come back",5,2016,05,05
18,Simply sincerely subliminal ,"There's not much more to say that's not already been said about this hotel, which works on so many levels.

It's fair to expect as standard, top quality products and amenities from a 5* hotel, to feel as though luxury is everywhere and the finer details have not been over looked. These are delivered in abundance throughout The Serras as are pure design delights.

The difference is the natural feel of The Serras, not just the high level of professionalism which makes everything so simple as a guest, but the friendly personal atmosphere enthused by every member of the hotel team. To be able to create the 'home from home' comfortable experience with not even a hint of the 'posh arrogance' often an undertone of high end establishments is clearly not luck. 

The Serras is a wonderful hotel to stay at because it delivers a sublime sensation of warmth & sincerity. ",5,2016,05,04
18,Fantastic hotel,One of the finest hotels I have stayed in and the service and friendliness is the best I've ever known. Throw in a great restaurant and excellent location and it doesn't get better than this. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona.,5,2016,05,04
18,Truly Outstanding,"From the moment we checked in, we felt welcome and valued. And over the course of our four night stay, we never did not feel that way. Impeccable service, great food, cool vibe, terrific location. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough!",5,2016,04,29
18,Really a cosy hotel,"The best hotel I have ever tried in Barcelona and near all the best in town. Really friendly staff and very helpful. We had a wonderful large room, not noisy at all, with a comfortable bed and big bathroom all in white. Just some remarks n the restaurant where the dinner was under stress but the breakfast top for the price. I warmly recommend!",4,2016,04,28
18,Really - a splendid boutique hotel in BCN!,"This perfect little hotel is in a perfect location with perfect food, is perfectly designed and in which you will get a perfect, quiet night's sleep on a perfect bed.  :-)  Seriously, it is one of the greatest hotel experiences I've had in the US, the UK or the EU.  If you like great interior design, a wonderful friendly staff, gorgeous food, a perfect location and personal service -  this is the only hotel in which to stay in BCN.    BCN can be noisy and busy at night, but these rooms with massive windows have essentially been soundproofed so you'll sleep deeply and awake refreshed.  The restaurant Informal is really extraordinary, and please do plan to take breakfast at the hotel. Flawless pastries, local hams and cheeses, freshly squeezed orange juice and ripe fruit - as well as robust egg dishes if the buffet doesn't fill you up (which it will.)

I do suggest paying a bit more for a room with a view to the front harbor and street.  It's lively and sunny and splendid.  Stayed for a week, and I will be back.  Every single member of the staff was fun and very helpful.  This is how a hotel experience ought to be done - it's beautiful, accessible, sophisticated but without a single air of pretense.   Thank you Serras!",5,2016,04,28
18,Great boutique hotel on waterfront,"We had stayed 2 days in the ""fifth avenue"" part of town, at the Hotel Majestic, a big hotel in a prime spot. But we were looking forward to our last night at this small, boutique hotel near the port by the gothic quarter and were not disappointed. It all comes down to what you want. For those who want a big hotel in a more uptown neighborhood the Majestic may be the ticket, but I much prefer Crosby- like hotels (the one in Soho!) that are small, more personal and attentive to detail. 
The location is GREAT - right on the waterfront and right by the gothic quarter - perfect. Picasso started his career in this building (his studio!) and it's a gorgeous building both inside and out. The views from the rooftop bar are breathtaking towards the port. Beds were very comfortable with an extensive pillow ""menu"" of 10 different pillows We had a room with a fantastic view of the water front. The shower was great, the layout of the room perfect, the wireless was include and all the amenities were top notch I didn't use the gym or the spa, but I was glad to see there was a gym for my next visit. An excellent restaurant is downstairs and 2 bars (on one the roof) are at your disposal.
If you like boutique hotels and great location, this is THE place to stay in Barcelona. Our only small disappointment is that unlike the Hotel Majestic, they said they absolutely could NOT accommodate a second child so we ended up having to put our kids in the hotel 2 doors down. Not sure why as they both could have fit on the sofa bed. So maybe not family friendly unless you get two separate rooms but other than that, a home run and the prepaid price was a bit less than the normal rate.",5,2016,04,22
18,"What an amazing hotel, cant rate highly enough","Myself and my wife stayed at The Serras at the end of February for our Anniversary.  From the moment we walked through the door (actually before we even got to the door!) the staff were courteous, and couldn't do enough to help.

The room was gorgeous, with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed.  The bar on the 1st floor was great, as was the roof terrace, and we spent alot of time up there drinking Gin and Tonic, even though it was a bit chilly at times !!!  The restaurant was very good, the cost was reasonable considering the standard of food.  The only hiccup was when my wife was presented with a cake which we assumed was for our anniversary, but was actually for someone else's birthday.  Slightly awkward as we had already started tucking in !!

We would stay there again in an instant, it was one of the best hotels I have stayed in around the world.",5,2016,04,21
18,'Bravo' for the Hotel Manager!,"My husband and I stayed at The Serras Hotel for seven days.  We chose this hotel based on the ranking, location and the reviews on Tripadvisor.   At check-in, we sat in comfortable chairs surrounded by no less than 4 staff members who were there to answer our questions and explain details about the hotel. They even gave us complimentary glasses of champagne while we were checking in, (a very nice touch after a long journey).  During our stay, we had the privilege to meet and talk to the hotel manager while having breakfast.  We also saw him in the lobby chatting with other customers during different days of the week. This shows that he truly cares and wants to hear from the guests.  No wonder that The Serras is ranked number 1 in Barcelona!  The hotel is beautiful, elegant and modern.  In my opinion, the hotel is more beautiful in person than in pictures.  The hotel uses a special fragrance that you smell the moment you enter the hotel and everywhere on the premises.  I believe you can purchase that fragrance at the hotel. It will be nice to have a bottle at home to bring back wonderful memories once in while.  We stayed in a Junior suite with sea view on the 5th floor.  The view is spectacular.  The hotel is situated on Paseo Colon which is a busy street and can be noisy.  However, the moment you close the windows, the room is quiet.  The noise was never a problem for us.  Our suite was beautiful and elegant.  Each night, we received two complementary bottles of water along with delicious pastries, (different pastry each day).  They truly pay attention to details.  The hotel also has a nice rooftop with amazing views.  We also enjoyed walking each day to the Gothic Quarter where we found many amazing shops and restaurants.   If you are thinking of staying at this hotel, you will not be disappointed.  We apologize for not remembering everyone’s names but many thanks  to each one of The Serras staff and  especially to the manager for making sure the hotel is magnificent!

18,1st Rate on every level,"Perfect boutique hotel.  Open only a year, this hotel has all the modern conveniences (USB ports, Nespresso machines and rain shower heads that we want) Yet, its located in the oldest part of town overlooking the marina and a park area.  With all the fundamentals in place, it is the staff that raises The Serras to the highest level.   From our first drinks and snacks on the lovely Rooftop Bar, the staff catered to our experience and remembered our preferences.  
TIP: After trying tapas around town, settle in to the Hotel restaurant Informal, for more than just one meal.  Crazy good.",5,2016,04,19
18,Beautiful amazing hotel,"My wife and I visited for my 40th (boo), and we picked very well. Stunning hotel but it's very best feature among many are the staff. You will struggle to come across a more friendly professional team anywhere. From check in (with a glass of cava), to showing us around the hotel, to helping when we were pick pocketed and a bit upset! It's location is brilliant, the bar on the roof is great too. But location is key, bars and restaurants everywhere, 5 mins walk to the metro and 10 to the beach.
All in all the best hotel I've ever stayed at and it made the holiday.
Thank you all, loved it.",5,2016,04,18
18,Little Gem ,The serras is a small contemporary design hotel. It is located in a great position by the marina giving easy access to the city and the gothic quarter. The staff at the hotel are all very helpful & friendly & they go out of their way to accommodate guests wishes. Their concierge service is great. The rooms are well designed & the beds are up there with the most comfy ever!! I slept like a baby. The food is also fabulous so the restaurant is a must. The rooftop bar is an added bonus with amazing views. There is a small plunge pool too with loungers for sunny days. They also have a small gym which isn't advertised on their website (I was happy even though it's tiny)  I would highly recommend this hotel - loved everything about it & Barcelona too. Beautiful city & can't wait to return. The only negative - leaving the sunshine to return to a wet & cold London. ,5,2016,04,14
18,EXCELLENT HOTEL IN LOVELY WATERFRONT LOCATION,I can't rate this small boutique hotel highly enough. Great location. Very friendly staff that all speak perfect English. The rooms are super delux and there is a lovely roof top bar and terrace. Just around the corner from the hotel are lots of classy independent shops and restaurants in the Born district.,5,2016,04,14
18,Birthday Treat,"Can not rate this hotel high enough. The decor was spectacular, food fantastic and the  staff were extremely helpful and friendly. location is superb, right by the marina and gothic area. We had an amazing stay. Great night spent on the roof terrace. Definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone, you will not be disappointed!",5,2016,04,08
18,Exceptional in Every Way,"We stayed here for 4 nights during our anniversary celebration and were extremely pleased with this hotel. Upon arrival a complimentray bottle of Cava and tray of tapas in our room set the tone for the high level of service. The amenities, staff, restaurant, rooftop deck were all amazing.  We have traveled extensively and have very high standards--The Serras did not disappoint! Our concierge, Rebecca, booked all our restaurant reservations in advance and was incredibly helpful. I think the location is perfect, with a fantastic view of the harbor but close to all the shops and great bars/restaurants in Gothic and El Born. And--Nespresso machines in all the rooms--a real plus for us coffee addicts! Highly, highly recommend!",5,2016,04,08
18,A gem in Barca,"Lovely but pricey boutique hotel. Worth it! Staff couldn’t be friendlier or more helpful. Rooms very comfy with complimentary cava (sparkling wine) and fruit. Great location at edge of Gothic Quarter. Walk to so many restaurants and Picasso Museum. Cheerful staff will book your museum visits and print out your tickets in a flash. Highly recommended. (Rooftop garden was being refurbished – looked like it was going to be very nice when completed.) Small gym available with treadmill, elliptical and weights to help offset too many tapas . . . Don’t miss this gem.",5,2016,04,06
18,Great hotel,"Have to say what an absolutely fabulous hotel this is in every way , my 12 year old son and I came here for two nights for el Classico but have ended up extending our stay for a further two nights which was handled brilliantly by the hotel to the extent they made sure we didn't even have to move rooms , breakfast is lovely Rooms are fantastic and location is superb overlooking the harbour , Everyone here are so friendly it really is a pleasure staying here , a special mention for Danny who really has gone out of his way in making our stay more special advising restaurants booking train tickets and much more , always smiling friendly and there to say hello and a special handshake to my son , 11 out of 10 , really would look forward to staying here again",5,2016,04,04
18,World class - among my top 5 city hotels globally!,"One of the best hotels anywhere in the world -- The Hotel Serras is a fantastic, family owned hotel in a great location with all of Barcelona's great attractions within easy reach.  The hotel is located on the edge of the Gothic Quarter with a view of the port and a short walk from the beach.  Sagrada Familia, Casa Botllo, Montjuic, Camp Nou, the beach and of course the Gothic Quarter are all within walking distance or a short taxi ride.

The hotel is beautifully designed from the lobby entrance to the guest rooms to the rooftop pool terrace.  The hotel restaurant, El Informal, is one of the best restaurants in the city (which is a huge compliment given the level of dining in Barcelona) and it is a real treat to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner here.  We stayed 7 nights at the hotel and felt like special guests from the first minute to the last.  

What makes the hotel very special is the attention to detail of the management team and all of the staff at the Hotel Serras.  All of the staff go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable and memorable - This is true from the front desk to the restaurant to the staff looking after the guest rooms to the management team.

We stayed with our 3 children ages 9,9 and 12 in a 2 bedroom suite (room 401) overlooking Passeig Colom and the Port and found the space to be perfect for a family of 5.  The bathrooms are fantastic with big rain showers and the bedrooms are super comfortable - our room was an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona.

During our stay I went with my oldest son to see El Classico at Nou Camp and the hotel arranged a car at short notice when none was available due to a transit strike by having a family member drive us both ways -- simply world class service!  

Our children felt very welcomed and enjoyed everything at the hotel including the fantastic meals at restaurant El Informal.  

The Hotel Serras is now among my top 5 big city hotels globally along with the Four Seasons in New York, the Park Hyatt in Sydney, The Four Seasons in Hong Kong and the Portrait Roma in Rome.  What sets all of these hotels apart from their competitors is the care and attention of the staff.

In conclusion, you will not be disappointed at the Hotel Serras -- fantastic location, beautiful interiors, superb food and exceptional staff!",5,2016,04,04
18,Perfecto!,"I have just stayed for 3 nights from the 27th at their Junior Suite Sea View.  Everything goes perfect: the property, the room, the design, the staff, the food, the service & the etc....  If you are looking for a luxury boutique hotel to enjoy the Catalonia modern home feel, here is definitely the best choice at Barcelona.  I spent most of my time staying in the room, take a bath then hold a cup of espresso standing on the room balcony with the Port Veli view in front.  It's worth  any penny for my flying 18 hours from Hong Kong to The Serras.",5,2016,04,03
18,Amazing Honeymoon,"From the moment we arrived at the hotel until the time we left, we were given a service out of the world. We are a very we'll travelled couple an have visited some of the best hotels in the world and can surely say that the service level of this hotel is one of the best in the world. Our Honeymoon experience was amazing. Special mention for Nabila at Reception. She was very helpful and exceeded our customer service exceptions. Also, breakfast is one of the best we have ever had. Great Hotel, Great Location, Great People. The Serras is one of the best boutique hotels in the world.",5,2016,04,02
18,Excellent,"Fantastic location, excellent service.  Beautiful, new rooms.  Very comfortable beds.  Staff went out of their way to help on everything.  Price is expensive--about 2x what 4 star hotels are in Barcelona but it was clearly a notch above.",5,2016,04,01
18,Birthday treat,"Absolutely fantastic hotel and restaurant. Stayed for 3 nights in March, can't recommend it enough. Room was brilliant overlooking the harbour, roof terrace lovely for a drink. The staff just can't help you enough.   ",5,2016,04,01
18,An exceptional Hotel,"From the moment we were picked up by the executive transport service to the Cava at the reception and the fizz and nibbles that were in our room because it was our honeymoon, The Serras hotel excelled in every way. The staff were very attentive, the quality of food excellent and the well stocked bars manned knowledgeably. The roof top terrace and bar overlooking the marina has to be experienced with a glass or two of Cava Sangria.",5,2016,03,30
18,Best honeymoon experience,"It is the best Hotel I have ever stay. Don't think it twice. 
Everything was perfect. The restaurant , the bar and the rooftop are great. Even the room in the TV is great.

They really think about all the details that make your stay special. The staff is amazing, the roof bar is great and the restaurant is amazing. 

Try the Patatas Bravas , they are to die for (really).

The Serras actually captures the essence of Barcelona.

18,5 star service in a 5 star hotel,"It has it all - good location, near the water and near all attractions in the old city, yet it did not feel Ike we were in the middle of all the tourists; recently built/renovated to a high standard; and supreme customer service throughout.

They have figured how to make their guests feel special.",5,2016,03,28
18,Amazing stay!,"We stayed at The Serras for 3 nights with our 10 year old son. The staff and hotel were beyond excellent. Upon our arrival, we were served fresh orange juice and champagne. The hotel concierges, Cassie and Daniel, were exceptional. They went out of their way to make our stay and Barcelona experience fantastic. They made dinner, bike tour, and Gaudi reservations for us. Their recommendations were spot on. We cannot wait to return!",5,2016,03,25
18,Wow,"Can't fault anything about this boutique hotel. Prime position, amazing views from the rooftop bar, luxurious room, awesome food. Service was impeccable and made you feel so special. From the cava on check-in to little touches like the champagne and hors d'oeuvres left in the room on our arrival as it was our honeymoon.  Antonio, the manager, was amazing and he has created a very delightful hotel with staff who go out of their way to help. His experience working at the Dorchester in London shows.  
We were planning on eating out every night of our stay but ended up eating in the restaurant it was so good Their Michelin star chef created some amazing dishes. I particularly liked the pigeon and steak. 
It was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Congratulations to the whole team. We will be back!",5,2016,03,23
18,A special place,"We have just spent 3 nights at the Hotel Serras and what a wonderful experience it was. From the initial check in and tour of the Hotel by Rebecca along with a welcoming glass of Cava from Daniel, the Entire staff made you feel like you were a guest in their home, something the big Hotels generally lack. Being a boutique 28 room Hotel, they obviously have the guest numbers at a point where they can provide very personal service but nothing was too much trouble and I would strongly recommend the Hotel Serras to anyone looking for a special place to stay in Barcelona.",5,2016,03,23
18,Incredible Hotel in Barcelona,"Our two families stayed at The Serras for 6 nights. Our group had 4 rooms, all were perfect!! Fantastic!!! All the rooms were spotless, beautiful and had lovely views. The bathrooms were spacious and modern. Our first day we were greeted with Cava, juice and water. The personal touches are superb. We were given a tour of the hotel and then taken to our room. We had goodies, meat and cheese waiting for us. The beds were some of the best I have ever slept in.  Every time we left or returned to the hotel, we were personally greeted by the staff. Every night there was a delicious snack waiting for us on our night tables. I cant say enough great things about this hotel. The bar staff was excellent. We ate at the Hotel restaurant twice for Dinner. Great good and service.  The location was great as well. A short walk to the marina and beach, and a short walk to all the other beautiful sights in the Gothic center. I love love love this hotel and cant wait to come again.",5,2016,03,23
18,Excellent hotel,"Me and my wife spent a long week end in Barcelona . We stayed at the Serras hotel which has been suggested by our great friends. We loved the hotel and the service provided. The reception desk and the waiters at the restaurant were extremely gentle and easy to deal with. The hotel offers a delicious breakfast with a large of variety of food.
The location is very central . If we ever come back to Barcelona we definitely return to this hotel
The hotel is five stars but we give six stars!",5,2016,03,22
18,good service,"This is a good hotel with good service.  For those who have a lot of experience traveling in the Middle East or Asia, keep your expectations in check a bit, but still it is a nice boutique hotel with a focus on service.  You are greeted with a glass of cava or juice or whatever you want.  The staff go out of their way to be nice.  The hotel was great with accommodating our 6 month old baby and I was very impressed with  that -- I had emailed them just before coming to say that we were coming with a baby and when we got there, the room was already waiting with a crib set up and a cute toy, the bathroom had a baby towel adn basked of baby things.  Very nice touch, very well received!!  Note to families with babies, though -- we stayed in 2 different rooms and neither had a bathtub, only showers, and that did make things tough for us.  The bath products are good though.  The rooms we stayed in came with nespresso machine and a few complimentary pods, if you are so inclined.  We are tea drinkers and they immediately brought up a kettle.  The rooms were nice, one of them had a little balcony but it wasn't really usable.  
this is a MODERN boutique hotel (design hotel, if you will).  if you are into that, great.  If not, it might not be your thing.  slightly loud club music in the elevator, lobby, terrace, etc.
In terms of location -- this is about a 10 minute walk from the Ramblas, right on the edge of the gothic quarter, across from the port where the aquarium, etc. are.  When you read other hotel rooms you see that there are a lot of htings to take into consideration and I really think that it just depends on your preference and needs.  We came with our own car and so it would have been tough to be actually inside the gothic quarter or in many of the places on the ramblas.  The Serras is easier with a car.  keep in mind, parking is 40 euros per day, but they will valet it for you.  
the breakfast was quite good, but quite expensive.  we didn't try the hotel restaurant for anything else so can't review it.  in the gothic quarter there are literally hundreds of restaurants for reasonable prices and amazing food.
overall, a nice place and the service focus really does help.",5,2016,03,22
18,Great boutique hotel in a famous location,"We stayed here 2 nights after a cruise. The hotel is beautiful, well maintained and staff so very helpful. Location was great and near everything. Staff was very helpful and made dinner reservations at 2 different great restaurants, both which we truly enjoyed and would recommend. We had nightly turndown service with bottled water and a sweet treat and were greeted with a drink when we arrived. We were busy being tourists so we really did not get to use the facility much but there were several nice areas to have a drink and relax. 
Highly recommend this hotel- one of the best that I have stayed at.",5,2016,03,22
18,Best hotel experience I've ever had!,"I had to write a review because our stay at this hotel was truly incredible. The best service we've ever experienced, impeccable rooms, delicious food, excellent location, overall an incredible stay. Because we were traveling around Europe we stayed here twice, once on our way in and once on our way out. We had such an incredible stay at The Serras we extended one night, so because of this we actually stayed in 3 different rooms. We stayed in an executive room and a jr. suite which were absolutely gorgeous. One night was in a basic room, also incredibly nice, but a bit on the small side. I would definitely recommend an upgrade for the full experience. I can't wait to come back!",5,2016,03,19
18,GREAT hotel,"This is definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed. Everything there was perfect. The location - really near to the city center, only a few minutes walk from La Rambla. The staff was great, helpful and always kind. The room was comfortable, clean and spacious.
The breakfast buffet offer was really wide and everything was so tasty! We had a dinner in their restaurant (Informal) and - it was perfect! They prepared also birthday cake for me! It was wonderful and extraordinary stay for my birthday.",5,2016,03,15
18,AMAZING!!,"Possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in, just amazing from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. Staff were superb, nothing was too big of an ask for them day or night. Room was spotless, literally not one speck of dust in sight. Stayed for 3 nights and I never wanted to leave! Staff were also great at giving us details about certain places which were not typical tourist places to visit. Loved every minute of this hotel.",5,2016,03,14
18,Peaceful Ambience,"My stay at Hotel The Serras was lovely.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They all had great recommendations for local sites and restaurants.  Our room was quiet, comfortable, and decorated in a manner that made it feel peaceful and calm.   The bed was extremely comfortable, and we loved the pillows so much that we bought some!  I loved that the hotel was within walking distance of Las  Ramblas, but away from the bustle and noise.  We were also within walking distance of the beach, and Barcelona and the great restaurants.  We even found a brewery , Black Dog, for a great late night drink!  Our last night we ate at the hotel restaurant-the food was imaginative and very well done!  ",5,2016,03,13
18,World class hotel & customer service ,"We booked the Serras for a mini moon, taking our 8 month old with us. From the moment we arrived to the day we left, nothing was too much trouble. Family friendly, superb food, amazing rooms, rooftop bar, Le nine, definitely recommend anyone to stay. Reason no1 on tripadvisor, 100% will come again. Thanks to all the staff ",5,2016,03,13
18,One of the best I ever stayed in,"The hotel is a true 5 stars gem.
From the second you enter the lobby you are treated with smiles and hospitallity.
This place is clean as a whistle and has one of the best beds ever.
The breakfest is calm and delightful.
The rooftoop is amazing and relaxing, especially at night with a great view to the harbor.
The resturant is superb and super yummy.

The location is very good, right next to the gothic quarter and few minutes walk for the Ramblas.

The staff was always glad to help, wheather with resturants bookings, taxis and recommendations.

Cant praise this place enough.
Stay in the Serras hotel you won't regret !",5,2016,03,12
18,The best hotel,"My wife and me spent 4 splendid nights in this real 5 star hotel. Excellent  location near the marina, the Rambles, the old city of Barcelona and many other interesting places. 
It was the best hotel we have ever stayed in: clean, quiet, wonderful service and the staff was so helpful and so polite. Every thing was behind our expectation. ",5,2016,03,12
18,Great Hotel,"Everything we wanted, it had it all and the staff were great. It is really handy for where we were going and what we wanted to do. The staff focused on everything for us and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.",4,2016,03,10
18,Long-weekend in Barcelona,"My wife, baby and I just spent four nights at Hotel the Serras (in a junior suite) for a long-weekend. 

The hotel is conveniently located with great interior design. The rooms are well appointed and the bed perfect for a great night's sleep. The homemade sweets delivered with the turndown service were delicious.  We very much enjoyed our dinner at the hotel restaurant, Informal; the Rooftop bar is great, especially for a late afternoon cocktail.

While the hotel is amazing it is the staff that really bring the Serras to the next level. The Staff were always extremely helpful and kind so a big thank you to them for making our stay so memorable!! 

We highly recommend Hotel the Serras and will stay there again on our next visit.",5,2016,03,07
18,"Service impeccable, location amazing","Pros:
Staff were unbelievable, some of the best hotel service ever received. They greeted us on the street, served us Cava, gave a tour of the hotel, made us feel like we were the only people staying there. 
Location is sensational - in the middle of gothic quarter and the marina. 
Room was modern, clean, everything felt brand new. 
Rooftop bar - brilliant views and service/drinks. 

Cons:
Not much to say here other than it was a bit strange that they charge 100 euro per night security deposit, quite high. Other than that, hotel was pretty much perfect. ",5,2016,03,05
18,Lovely Boutique Hotel,"Super location, friendly and knowledgeable staff, nicely appointed rooms, comfy bed and pillows - I really enjoyed the stay. Perhaps the only improvement could be a broader offering on the breakfast buffet but it was good enough. I would recommend the hotel. ",5,2016,03,05
18,30th Bday Stay,"Wonderful stay for a special Birthday. Attentive staff, clean and comfortable rooms and superb base location.
Stayed for 4 nights but could have easily stayed longer. Room was located on the fifth floor, very quiet and got a good nights sleep. The view out the window was of the building opposite but buildings are close together in the city, just walk out the front or go to the roof for a view.",5,2016,03,03
18,Incredible place,"My girlfriend brought me here for a long weekend for my birthday a couple of weeks ago
And I've got to say this place was incredible!.
From the second we arrived we were made to feel very special!, every member of staff couldn't do enough for us done to the smallest detail!.
The room was immaculate like the rest of the hotel and the food was out of this world! Not to mention the breakfast which was fit for a King! The only slight negative I would give is that one night we tried to book into the restaurant and it was full!, I feel booking into a hotel such as this guests should have first refusal!, apart from that it was perfect!",5,2016,02,28
18,A must in Barcelona,"We spent a night at The Serras last January, pre-cruise.  We have always preferred boutique hotels.  We based our decision on it's tripadvisor rating, and and all of the good comments cannot give this hotel justice.  It's beyond it's rating.

We absolutely loved the hotel and found the staff to be extraordinary.  Do not hesitate to book a stay at The Serras, you won't regret it.

The room was perfect - we had the junior suite.  It was spacious and clean.  The little extra touches are what made our stay special.  The staff cater to every sense, from the moment you step in the door to the moment you leave.  The only way to describe the vibe of The Serras would be a fusion of zen creative elegance.  Perfect balance.

The attention to detail impressed me.  All five senses where taken care off, with no exaggeration.        I'm almost nostalgic writing this review!

Sight:  outstanding decor and design
Smell: the aromatherapy is everywhere, subtle and enhancing
Touch: comfy beds, perfect temperature  
Hearing: great lounge music in public venues, quiet rooms to sleep in
Taste: we had a wonderful meal at ""Informal"".  The gnocchi was by far the best we've ever had.  The Châteaubriand melted under the fork. 

The staff went well beyond any service seen elsewhere.  They were professional and friendly, you could easily sense that they believed in their product and enjoyed their job",5,2016,02,25
18,Terrific Location & Even Better Staff!,"This hotel is absolutely terrific. The location in the Gothic Quarter is perfect, as Port Vell, Barceloneta, the start of Las Ramblas and the Born areas are all under a 10 minute walk away. Every staff member we encountered was very warm and welcoming, from the doormen, front desk, wait staff in the restaurant, bartender and housekeeping. The staff were all very helpful and friendly, making us feel like we were the most important guests in the hotel. The general manager was often there and interacting with the guests, and he introduced himself to us one morning to ask how our stay was. I told him that in our experience, more often than not it is the staff that makes or breaks a hotel and the staff here was phenomenal. Our room on the 3rd floor was very comfortable and impeccably clean. The large rain shower head was terrific. Turn down service was terrific as it included bottles of mineral water and a different small sweet treat each day. As a boutique hotel, it is smaller which I appreciate as it never felt crowded. The breakfast was great with varied choices and was plentiful enough that we didn't need to stop for lunch/tapas until late afternoon. We also had dinner at their restaurant Informal one night. The food was terrific from appetizers through to dessert. The cocktails were expertly crafted and the bottle of local cabernet was superb (Jean Leon La Scala). We sat at the show table with a view of the kitchen which was really fun and the chef made sure to interact with us and make sure we were enjoying our food. I highly recommend staying here, as the location, staff, food, cocktails and rooms are all top notch.",5,2016,02,22
18,BEAUTIFUL BARCELONA BREAK,"This hotel is absolutely delightful, from the moment you arrive at the door to the moment you sadly leave.  We had a car meet us at the airport (an extra) and I have to say he was lovely.  We had Cava on arrival & were shown around this beautiful boutique hotel whilst our cases were taken to the room.  As others have stated the beds are very spacious and sooooooo comfortable - we didn't book breakfast, even though they serve it till 11.30 but we couldn't get out of these lovely beds in time - although having read the breakfast menu on our last night we were sad to have missed it. We had a sea facing suite (502), with amazing views over the marina and no street noise as long as the doors are shut properly.  Alex the barman made brilliant We ate in the restaurant 'Informal' on the last night and a bit like the breakfast wish we had tried it sooner, although quite possibly we would never have left the hotel if we had!!  You can sit at the kitchen to eat, behind glass & watch all the delicious food being created or more relaxing at a side table.  The service and food here too were excellent - can highly recommend the rice & sausages, we shared, but would have this to myself next time and an excellent chocolate fondant dessert.  also have to mention the most amazing chips I have ever had - I feel sure the chef will hate that I have called them chips but they are a must try.  thank you all for our fab 4 days, can't wait to come back.",5,2016,02,21
18,Faultless!!,"Spent a truly wonderful 3 nights here in a deluxe room. Outstanding service, decor, room, location, rooftop bar and food - we ate in El Formal on two nights which is extremely unusual for us as we like to try different restaurants! On our next trip to Barcelona we will most definitely stay at The Serras!",5,2016,02,21
18,Amazing service and location! ,"The one thing that stands out at this place, other than the amazing rooms, decor and location is the amazing service from the staff.  The most helpful and friendly staff in any European hotel I have been to.  I'm leaning Spanish and they were incredibly patient and encouraging when I tried to speak to them in Spanish. Rooms are very nice, modern and clean.  This place also has a gym (small but functional) and a Michelin star restaurant (although we didn't eat there).  Excellent location to the main / central parts of Barcelona.  We will return for sure.  Although we didn't go with our kids this time, this hotel is perfect for those travelling with or without kids.  Taxi cost to / from airport is approx 20 euros. ",5,2016,02,19
18,"Beautiful hotel, great location and truly excellent service!","We loved this hotel, and would highly recommend it. The design is cleverly modern and traditional at the same time. Rooms are luxuriously furnished and the staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful - nothing was too much trouble! The location is opposite the marina, about 5-10 minutes walk to the beach and the same to the Gothic quarter and Barcelona cathedral. It took about 20 minutes to walk to the Gaudi houses and 30 mins to Sagrada Familia along beautiful stretches of road boasting mordernistic architecture. Fantastic stay in Barcelona! @las Serras - we will most certainly be back to stay with you again soon. Thank you so much for such a memorable holiday.",5,2016,02,17
18,Great boutique hotel,"The Serras is perfectly located on the harbour front and within easy walking distance of all the main attractions of central barcelona.
The room was modern but very comfortable.
The standout feature is the staff. All most engaging and always looking to provide assistance without being intrusive.
The attraction of only having a few rooms is only offset by limited options at breakfast. 
A perfect little hotel from which to discover the history, architecture and life in Barcelona",4,2016,02,17
18,Cozy and chique hotel,The staff was amazing. Always helpful. The room clean and comfortable. Room service was very good. The food was very good at the restaurant. The location couldn't be better. I will definitely go back to this hotel!!,5,2016,02,16
18,JUST SUPERB,"We arranged to be collected from the airport our driver Oscar (excellent chap) met us with a welcome smile. The drive both comfortable and relaxing took away the stress of car hire and mad taxi driving.
As Oscar had phoned ahead,the hotel concierge and reception waited for us and checked us in with a chilled Cava in our hand. We toured the hotel and loved the roof terrace bar, six floors up with views of the marina. It was a little fresh at this time of year so when we went for a drink later (don't miss it) we got our own gas fuelled log burner warm a toast but still not shorts and t-shirt weather.
Our room has a wonderful boutique feel with a huge telly and mixed meat tapas waiting for u. On the fifth floor and a marina view with balcony, It is fantastic view. The only negative is traffic noise especially the overly  loud ambulance and police sirens.
For the first time in years our mini bar is at a far price and the unique gifts for sale are brilliant.
Staff are warm and attentive but not pushy or intrusive.
Here for 4 nights will update through the week.",5,2016,02,16
18,Perfect First trip to Barcelona,"We spent 8 nights at hotel The Serras.  The room was very comfortable, service extremely attentive throughout the hotel especially concierge services at the front desk.  We enjoyed a excellent dinner at the hotel restaurant and delighted with the views from the 6th floor terrace.  The hotel is also very well located which allowed us to walk to many of the main sites in Barcelona, while taxis were readily available and metro stations close by. It was the perfect place to spend our anniversary.",5,2016,02,12
18,It only gets better,Second visit at The Serras and it was even better than the first one if that was even possible. They remembered us at check in and at breakfast they remembered how we like our eggs and coffee. We decided to treat ourselves and we booked a junior suite which was an excellent choice! ,5,2016,02,12
18,Wonderful hotel and outstanding customer service!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Serras over the past weekend for our 10th Wedding Anniversary. 
From the minute we got out of the taxi the customer service we received was outstanding. The amazing staff could not do enough for us and seemed genuinely happy to be part of this wonderful boutique hotel.
The hotel is lovely, small, but perfectly formed. Our room was on the second floor and whilst not looking out over the port was spacious and well appointed. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom luxurious. Considering we were above the restaurant the sound proofing in our room was excellent.
When we arrived we were spoilt with a bottle of Cava and a delightful antipasti board of goodies together with a handwritten note congratulating us on our anniversary which was such a lovely gesture.
We ate at El Informal on Saturday night and the food was delicious and again the customer service was amazing! We also  thoroughly enjoyed cocktails on the roof terrace with beautiful views of the port.
Located on the edge of the gothic area and opposite the port I can't think of a better location to enjoy a lovely weekend in Barcelona.  We would not hesitate to return to the Serras (and El Informal) and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to this beautiful city.",5,2016,02,09
18,Great hotel,"Very recommended.
The rooms are very nice but small. Not the best view. But yet one of the best option in Barcelona. The service is very high. The shower is very nice. Very good location. Great bar on the top floor. Great food. Will decently choose this hotel again.",5,2016,02,08
18,Personal 5* service. Amazing room. Even more amazing bathroom.,"From the moment we entered, the staff made us feel special. This is a boutique 5* hotel, with a limited number of front-of-house staff. We'd caught them off guard by arriving without a taxi (by metro) and the doorman seemed flustered and embarrassed that we'd had to push the door open ourselves. We were welcomed with a seat and a glass of sparkling Cava each while we checked in and received information about the city. My wife particularly liked discussing Spanish clothes brands not available in the UK with the receptionist/concierge.
We were then taken on a tour of the hotel, including the rooftop bar (which is very nice and peaceful place to spend an hour or two). During this time, the doorman delivered our bags to the room.
The hotel is clearly recently refurbished. Despite that, the choice of pale yellow carpets in the main corridors was probably a mistake. The room had modern wooden floor, but the corridor looked dirtier than it probably was.
The room is a reasonable size (bigger than the photos on the website would suggest). The bathroom is big and very luxurious. Massive shower. Amazingly comfortable bed. Evening turndown service. Everything you can possibly expect in a 5* hotel.
We didn't have breakfast (not included in our rate), but did have lunch at the restaurant. Book early, the restaurant was full for dinner on the night we stayed. Have to say, though the food was nice, the service is mediocre in comparison to the main hotel staff service. 
Overall, this hotel made our final night in Barcelona really memorable. I would definitely return.",5,2016,02,07
18,Sensational hotel with amazing service ,"Here for a couple days offsite meeting.

Somehow manages to be very cool and chic without being pretentious.

Where to start... When you arrive, the front of house is very welcoming and we were each greeted with a glass of bubbly while we checked in.

The decor is contemporary but feels sumptuous and very comfortable.

The rooms and bathroom carry the same decor with really nice touches such as a board with artisan chocolate, Iberian sausage and almond biscuits.

Bar and restaurant again simply fabulous service and quality.

All in all a great stay!

Will be coming back with my wife for a long weekend soon!
",5,2016,02,06
18,Best hotel in Barcelona,"Fantastic boutique hotel - every member of staff was fantastic, right from when we  arrived and were sat at check in drinking  complimentary Cava to the sad time when we had to check out to go home.. Rooms were fantastically well equipped and spotlessly clean   - comfortable beds , good facilities and great walk in power shower.. The roof terrace bar was fabulous with great views over the marina   ... Excellent location in front of the marina with all the main attractions within easy walking distance .. Will definitely stay here again...",5,2016,02,05
18,Great hotel,"I booked this hotel for the anniversary of my parents, where we stayed with the whole family. A true boutique hotel with excellent service and staff. Location wise also perfect. One hardly notices anything of the busy street just outside and many great restaurants in the vicinity. Breakfast is great and the rooms have everything one wishes for. I would definitely recommend it if your budget allows it.",4,2016,02,04
18,Beautiful hotel in old town,Booked this hotel for a mini break at the end of January. Got a fantastic deal through booking.com of €205 per night which was amazing for such a beautiful and smart hotel. From the minute you arrive nothing is too much trouble. Staff are great. Hotel is relaxed and calm and you could stay forever. Beautiful rooms in a beautiful location. Would love to go back and experience the roof bar in the summer for its amazing views. Highly recommend,5,2016,02,01
18,Great boutique hotel,"This is our home from home in Barcelona now.  We received a fantastic welcome into a smart chic hotel.  Our room was small but well appointed (I'm not sure we got the upgrade the website promised) and the service throughout our stay was friendly and professional - less formal than one of the big established premier league hotels but every bit as good.
The rooftop terrace and bar were great - would be even better on a warm summer's evening - the hotel needs to watch out though - a stag party caroused for an hour or so - completely out of keeping with the ambience of the bar and not to the delight of other patrons.  Not sure if this is your niche guys.

The location is superb - right by the marina and the breakfast great, if a little samey on choice.

But it's the staff who make this hotel and they are outstanding.  We will definitely return.",5,2016,01,27
18,Gorgeous!,"This stylish boutique hotel deserves all the accolades it is receiving. It is a sexy and very chic establishment with extremely high standards on virtually all levels. It is a small hotel that offers intimate service and excellent cuisine. The rooms are extremely well thought out, immaculate and very comfortable.",5,2016,01,26
18,A hotel that defies description!,"The moment you enter The Serras you will become aware that you’re in a very special place.  The Serras is ideally situated in the Barrio Gotico neighborhood of Barcelona and is walking distance to many tourist sights and wonderful restaurants.  My husband and I spent four nights at The Serras last November, and our experience was outstanding.  We completely agree with all accolades expressed by other reviewers – elegant setting, beautiful room, spacious bathroom, friendly and efficient service, and tasty food at Informal Restaurant (see separate review).  The fact that this hotel is doing so well is a credit to the managers and staff.  We truly hope to see you again.",5,2016,01,26
18,Mini weekend break,It was a lovely hotel with really helpful staff. We went in Dec 2015 and had a fantastic time.It was close to Las Rambla and all amenities. Food was lovely in the restaurant and it has a lovely rooftop bar.,5,2016,01,25
18,Great Boutique Hotel,"Service stands out at this hotel.  My husband, son (8yrs) and I stayed here for 3 nights in one of their suites.  The staff at the hotel are very inviting.  They took the initiative to call me (a couple of times since I missed their first call) to find out our son's name since they didn't have it in the reservation.  Come to find out this was so that they could write him a special little note and leave a present in our room.  The champagne at check-in was a welcome treat.  We had the pleasure of being at the hotel for New Years Eve.  They encouraged guests to celebrate on the rooftop at midnight and it was absolutely wonderful.  Additionally, when we booked the reservation I booked to include breakfast.  WOW!  What an amazing breakfast.  I would encourage anyone to have the breakfast added to the reservation.  The room was wonderful.  For American standards it was small but for European standards it was very roomy.  We loved the décor and the layout of the room.",5,2016,01,24
18,"Highly recommended - Lovely hotel, great service and ideally located",This is a very nice hotel with great service. The service was impeccable and staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is located in the Gothic quarter which itself makes it a great place to stay. I recommend this place highly.,4,2016,01,24
18,Nice place,"Situated in a good area,i like the design of the hotel,the furniture,services.I didn't like the fact that it was a little bit noisy in my room.Worth going there no doubt.I stayed 7 nights this month and I felt like I was home.The buffet is remarkably good.The receptionist was really nice giving us useful tips of where to go",4,2016,01,23
18,This hotel is a must when staying in Barcelona,"Just returned after spending two nights for my wifes birthday, we were met at the front door by the consierge to collect our bags. The fantastic receptionist (sabrina i think was her name) greeted us by name and with a very welcoming way introduced us to the hotel. They went the extra mile and brought us Cava and water then a nice slice of cake with a candle for my wifes birthday. 
So the first impression was a good one, we were shown around the hotel, it is small but very well presented, lovely roof top bar, our room was a fair size, the shower is just fantastic, a small balcony to stand out on, and a bottle of Cava waiting inside again.
We ate in the hotels restaurant (very nice) for the first night, the bed was large and very comfy.
Breakfast wasn't included but we paid for it anyhow, glad we did the buffet selection is very nice, cereal to start, yogurt, juice, tea, cooked omelette, meat and cheese selection then i managed to squeeze in pastries too. 
The hotel is located 10 mins from beach on foot, las ramblas and the catalunya square.
Airport to hotel taxi with tip was €35
Overall a fantastic hotel i would and have already recommended this hotel.
Staff are absolutely fantastic
Bed is out of this world
Shower i didn't want to get out of
Please don't take my word for it, go stay there yourself 
One criticism is the hall way carpet in yellow is not the best colour
That is truely the only criticism i could find",5,2016,01,22
18,Faultless ,"Myself and my husband stayed at the Serras for my birthday treat. From the moment we arrived to the day we checked out (5 days later) was amazing. The staff are incredibly helpful in every way, the waitress at breakfast remember your coffee order and they always have a smile (thank you Anna and Julia - you both were wonderful). The ladies at reception were more than willing to book our reservations for dinner. The breakfast is delicious - the poached eggs are to die for!!! The rooms are a little on the small side but that's because of the period/age of the building - it was just amazing to be in the same hotel where Picasso had his studio. The decor is beautiful and very art deco. The hotel is stunning. There is nothing at all I can complain about. We will 100% be returning. Thank you all at the Serras for making my birthday so very memorable! Hopefully see you all in two years ;-)",5,2016,01,20
18,only 1 night but a magic night,"we were staying in another hotel and decided to spoiled ourself for our last night. couldn't choose better hotel. was simply perfect. we were in junior suite looking the sea and spend all night in the hotel. first at the restaurant and then in the rooftop, we ended up with a bath in our room.. was amazing, thank you.",5,2016,01,19
18,Brilliant overall,"Amazing rooms with great views to the Barcelona Harbour, awesome terrace with legit pool included and one of the best restaurants to eat at in the city, quality + quantity! Staff really caring and location outstanding",5,2016,01,18
18,A really great hotel in a truly wonderful city,"It’s many years since I’ve been to Barcelona and after two nights in this great city, I really don’t understand why I’ve left it so long.

I booked the Serras for a two night stay based on the Trip Advisor reviews that the hotel has received – my husband and I weren’t disappointed…

A couple of days before we arrived, the hotel made contact just to check that everything was in order and whether or not we had any special requests – a much nicer touch than receiving an e-mail reminder.

On arrival, we were greeted by the exceptionally friendly and very helpful reception staff (plus a couple of glasses of cava).

The hotel is in a great location overlooking the marina.  We had wonderful views with windows on two sides of the room. It’s in a quiet spot, but the buzz of the old town is just a few minutes walk away. 

Our room was spotlessly clean and had all of the amenities you could ask for.  I’d read all the rave reviews about the beds, which didn’t make much sense until you’ve slept in them – so comfortable!

If you do nothing else on your visit go inside Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia – it’s truly breathtaking.  I’d also recommend a little bar called “Bar Avesta’ which is just round the corner from the hotel.  We had great fun in there.  If you like the odd cocktail or two, I’d suggest making your way to ‘Boadas’, which is just off La Rambla -  wonderful cocktails and great entertainment.

Next time we’re in Barcelona, we’ll definitely be staying at the Serras.",5,2016,01,15
18,New and Interesting hotel,"Stayed at the Hotel Serras because of the Tripadvisor reviews  .  Hotel is in the old area of Barcelona across from the port  and is a small boutique hotel , but they have  made great use of their limited space . Their staff is over the top with their attention and knowledge , and try very hard to please their customers . The  building  was gutted and rebuilt with not much attention to what it cost,  and  everything is first class . The doors to the rooms are the best of any in any hotel I have ever stayed in , and must have cost a fortune . We had a two room suite overlooking the port which was great  . Some of their  rooms do not have much of a view , so make sure you understand this  before you reserve . They have a really great General Manager !",5,2016,01,12
18,A personal paradise,"I had the cahnce to spend two days at the Serras just before new year's eve.

I usually stay at the Art's hotel but this time i wanted to try something new.

Non the less the serras has some more attractive rate but the service you get there is as personal as you could get.

This boutique hotel is led by a charming and sympathetic general manager Antonio who took the time to greet us during check-in and who sat down for a quick chat during our breakfast.

The entire team plays the same game. The staff call you by name and makes you feel at home from the first minute you get in.

Now about the establishment:  It simply has the best location, the bar is open 24/7, the roof terrace with swimming pool is breath taking. the rooms are modern, bright and comfortable and the beds are phenomenal.

Overall my experience was fantastic, i strongly recommend it if you are looking for an affordable, luxurious boutique hotel in Barcelona. 

Did I mention that the breakfast is the best I have had in any hotel so far?",5,2016,01,12
18,Didn't meet expectations,"My wife and I planned to spend 7 days in Barcelona and we followed the excellent reviews for ""The Serras"". We booked more than 6 months in advance and asked for a room on a high floor with much light. The staff at the reception was very friendly and showed us our room ... on the second floor, big, but facing the wall of the neighbors building - big disappointment. Our 6 months old request could not be fulfilled and now we should against a wall for 7 days. This may be ok for a stay of 2 or 3 nights, but not for 7. After complaining we got a slightly smaller, but light room facing the main street where we could see parts of the port. 
The room itself was modern and stylish but it didn't elicit a ""wow!"" on our side compared to other hotels we've seen and which didn't claim to be a five star boutique hotel. I admit that this is our personal impression. 
Although we know and are used to king size double beds, the most expensive “Hypnos Bed” was a pain for our hips and our back. We had the impression that the mattress was very firm and didn't provide softer parts for the shoulder and lower back to sink. We immediately felt the huge difference after returning home and feeling our own mattresses. 
The windows are of a good quality but not completely soundproof. You still remark the cars of the road and people speaking and laughing in front of the hotel. Maybe a room on a higher floor would have been better concerning this matter. Water flushing from higher floors doesn't remain unnoticed neither.

Concerning the public areas of the hotel, we felt that they have been overheated and the music was too loud. 

Hospitality is a great plus at the hotel. Everyone member of the excellent staff tries to fulfill your wishes as best as possible. 

We had one dinner and one breakfast at the hotel. The quality of the dinner was good, but the atmosphere was not quite relaxing. All tables are placed in a long row and all waiters and waitresses are constantly observing your table and clearing immediately after finishing the course. I agree that there is not much space around the tables but a bit less rushing would be nice. The breakfast on the other hand was not worth the money. If you eat ""à la carte"" you very soon reach the price for the buffet, so we decided to take the buffet. Compared to other hotels of a lower range the choice of products was disappointing. Additionally, the cheese was melting away, because together with the sausages it was not placed on a cooling plate as the yogurt. 

Altogether the stay was marked by the negative impression of the bed which couldn't be compensated by a ""wow"" effect of something else at the hotel. I know that this is question of subjective well-being but that's what these reviews are all about.",3,2016,01,10
18,Great  New Year's Eve at Barcelona,"We stayed at The Serras for four nights for New Year's Eve.
We travel a lot and visited many other places in Europe, however this was great experience from the very beginning.
We been accepted in the reception with a glass of cava, which was very nice start after a long flight.
This is a new small hotel (about 30 rooms), the rooms are not big but very stylish and comfortable.
The bed is comfy.
The service is very personal and all the stuff is very nice and helpful.
The location is great, most of the attractions reachable by foot and other by the metro which is not far away.
The tourist bus stops across the road.
The only downside I found is thin walls so you can hear the cleaning next room or loud voice in the corridor. 
All in all it did not bother us much and most of the time everything was peaceful. We would stay again.",5,2016,01,08
18,"Best service,ever","I have been travelling all over the world, but this would be one of my best experience.
Why? the people!! Always helpful and always smiling.Nice room and location, and a superb restaurant!
Had a minor ""issue"" with the cleaning of my room, but was solved at once.
I will be back :)

18,Absolutely Spectacular,"This hotel is a dream and nearly perfection from start to finish.  We were treated like family, even before we arrived.  Rebecca worked with us prior to our stay (and during) to make sure everything was perfect.  Our room was gorgeous (a little small) and, as advertised, the bed is insanely comfortable. We loved the rooftop pool/restaurant/bar.  And, you can't beat the location.",5,2016,01,05
18,Trendy Comfort in an Excellent Location,"My wife and I spent four nights here over Christmas which was our first time in Barcelona and we could not have been more fortunate to choose this boutique hotel.  The staff were uber helpful and polite and the location on the waterfront was within easy walking distance of the old town and rejuvenated former port buildings. The fact that the hotel only has 30 rooms meant noise was never a problem.  The room was very comfortable, modern and well appointed, while the the rooftop bar and 1st floor lounge were fashionable, relaxing places to hang out.  The restaurant has good food on top of a selection of nice wines: my wife left her menu choice one evening up to the chef and was not disappointed - a thoroughly excellent meal.  Overall a great experience and we cannot wait to go back.",5,2016,01,02
18,Just wonderful,"Stayed 3 nights to celebrate the 18th birthday of the daughter of friends. Very attentive staff! Bottle of cava in the room with compliments of the hotel for the 18th birthday! I have to agree with all the positive comments of other reviewers. Although I give this hotel 5 points I do have a tip: the yellow carpet in the hallways is already dirty after one year since the opening...it is beautiful...but please replace as soon as possible...this gives a shabby feeling and does not fit in the perfect feeling. Anyway, our intention is to return to this hotel and we'll certainly recommend it to all our friends!",5,2016,01,01
18,Above the rest,"This is the third time I visited Barcelona but I never realise where you stay makes such a difference to your experience and memory of the place. From the time our taxi arrived we were not just welcomed in by the doorman but looked after so well during the registration (where we were offered water, juice or sparkling wine), it's like going home for Christmas. The 'Informal' restaurant offers the best meal during our stay and they helped us to book our tables at all the other restaurants during our three day stay.  If you want to be pampered, this is the hotel. Perfect location as well.",5,2015,12,30
18,Will return,"My husband and I had just finished walking the Camino de Santiago and returned to Barcelona for two nights before flying home to the U.S. We stayed at the Serras and everything from start to finish was perfect. We were greeted with champagne, then a tour of the hotel, heavenly bed, beautiful rooftop terrace and the last night of our trip dined at the Informal. What a treat! Great wine, delicious food and presentation and the service was amazing! Hope to return again next summer",5,2015,12,26
18,"Outstanding - rooms, service, location (long review)","I have traveled frequently,  and often stay in 5 star hotels, so am not easily impressed. But The Serras hotel blew me away. Our experience with The Serras hotel began shortly after booking. I communicated with Rebeca, one of the managers regarding our needs. I should state that I am a rather demanding guest, with many specific requests regarding the room type and location. Knowing that we would be arriving in the late morning, I asked if it might be possible to check into our room early, as we would be very tired after an all night flight from NYC.  Rebecca advised that she could not guarantee an early check in, but they would do their best to accommodate us. She was extremely helpful, providing detailed information about the hotel, nearby restaurants, even where to shop for leather goods. She booked us tickets for a Flamenco show, and advised us regarding transportation to our ship, all  before we left home!  Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly and very professional front desk manager. We were welcomed, comfortably seated, and offered Cava, juice, and water. To our delight, our room was ready, and was exactly what I had requested: a king-bedded room with a sea view on a higher floor. We were thrilled with the room AND with the trouble to which the staff had gone to accommodate us. We had the feeling that they really cared that we be happy, and pulled out all the stops to ensure our comfort. The room was gorgeous, clean, modern, spacious. Bed and furnishings were all very comfortable and well designed. The bathroom was sparkling & spacious with a huge shower. Every conceivable amenity of the finest quality was provided, along with fluffy towels and bathrobes.
We soon came to realize that ALL of the staff at The Serras are charming, knowledgeable, and efficient. Everyone, from Rebeca and Elyssa at the front desk, to Sergio and Daniel who patiently provided us with assistance regarding the high tech features in the room, brought us ice, arranged for room service and for housekeeping to supply all of our special requests. But service at The Serras went beyond that. One evening we got lost walking home from a restaurant. After trying to find our way back for over an hour, we called the hotel. Daniel gave us directions, but when we did not appear within the 10 minutes he thought it would take for us to return, he ran out into the streets to look for us, and rescue us! We were actually very close to the hotel, but very confused and tired. That was truly a very kind thing for him to do, going way beyond his duties, we thought. That is just one example of the type of service provided by the staff at The Serras. They genuinely seem to care about the comfort and enjoyment of their guests.
We ate breakfast at the hotel, which provided an extensive and delicious buffet. The staff were efficient and helpful there as well.
The Serras is well located in the Gothic district, near to the Ramblas and to many restaurants. It is a small hotel, only about 30 rooms. It is located on a quiet street, but taxis were plentiful and easy to obtain. Not that the staff let us do that for ourselves; they jumped to get cabs for us whenever needed, and made sure to give the drivers directions not only as to where to take us but how to get there. This was very helpful since we learned that many taxi drivers do not speak English, and between us we had barely 10 words of Spanish and NO Catalon! 
The hotel Manager, Antonio, came over to me to personally greet me and to inquire if all was going well with our stay. How often does THAT happen, even in the best hotels? I told him how pleased and thrilled we were with the hotel and the staff, and complimented him on being able to retain such wonderful people who are clearly professionals in the hospitality industry. He informed me that he was very selective as to the people he hired, and went to great lengths to ensure they are well trained. I told him in this he had succeeded in a spectacular fashion. 
We were extremely impressed with The Serras, and highly recommend it to anyone lucky enough to visit Barcelona, a most beautiful city.",5,2015,12,19
18,Beautiful hotel - great team ,"From start to finish we loved The Serras. Before we arrived Carolina called to discuss any special requirements & offered help with local bookings etc. when we arrived we were greeted with a cold glass of Cava and a genuine warm welcome. The team are young, helpful, enthusiastic and professional.  They make you feel very special and the attention to detail never dropped. We were celebrating an anniversary and they made it an unforgettable trip. The hotel is elegant and beautifully finished.  The rooftop bar has a great vibe and the breakfast & dinner are superb.  We didn't get the chance to try lunch so that will be a good excuse to return.  Highly recommended. ",5,2015,12,15
18,design excellent place,"we have been few times to barcelona and always trying different hotel. since now not anymore we have got in love with the essence of this hotel. design, luxury, home felling, service. we were asked feedback and our only answer its everything wonderful. well done to the management",5,2015,12,12
18,Lots of charm!,This is a beautiful boutique hotel located in front to the marina in Barcelona. A short walk from Las Rambles and El Born neighborhood. Our initial room which faced the front of the hotel was too noisy for us so they kindly moved us to a side room which was much better. There is some noise from drunken revelers throughout the night as El Born seems to be the place to party. The restaurant is wonderful with an amazing morning buffet. Service was excellent.,4,2015,12,11
18,Wonderful welcome at the Hotel Serras!,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Serras in Barcelona and the service was wonderful!  After arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with a glass of excellent Cava and welcomed by Cassie.  Cassie helped us with many recommendations and maps of the city and made us feel totally welcomed.  She was the best!  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  We ended each evening up on the rooftop bar with a lovely view of the marina.  The maid service was also excellent.  I will certainly recommend the Hotel Serras to others and hope I get to stay there again.  I didn't want to leave!",5,2015,12,08
18,"Not even a year old, and it's the best in Barcelona","As a regular on tripadvisor I took the advise of other reviewers and booked the Serras. I can only say that my expectations were very high before we went to stay, the result...... Standards of service, quality of rooms, food, bar service, cocktails, waiters, waitresses, atmosphere, ambiance and position that would only be expected at some of the very best hotels you could ever visit. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the only discription we can offer is AMAZING, UNBELIEVABLE & A TOTAL PLEASURE TO HAVE STAYED AT THIS TOP HOTEL. From the reception to the restaurant finishing on the roof top bar with ALBERT ( a top man at his job) to the quality of the rooms, the bedding basically the whole experience was fantastic. As the saying goes you get what you pay for normally that is very true but here, you get a lot more.",5,2015,12,07
18,EXCELLENT !!!!,"I just returned from a vacation with my family at Barcelona. We had the pleasure to stay  at Hotel The Serras -  an Excellent  hotel, with great service, very comfortable and  definitely we will be back again to Hotel The Serras - The food is great, The rooms are Outstanding,   all the teams involved in providing  service are minded and dedicated to their job - with a continuous smile and good willing to really give you a good time - so - Thanks to all the team
you are doing a great job - see you in the next visit

18,"Perfect hotel, location, staff and value","I would highly recommend The Serras to anyone visiting Barcelona. Perfect hotel, location, staff and value. As well as being located on the door step of La Rambla, Marina and the Gothic Quarter the fantastic staff do everything they can do to make sure the stay is as perfect as possible.",5,2015,11,30
18,Unbelievable Service!,"Found this hotel on line and sounded intriguing.  Had no idea how awesome this hotel could be.  ALL staff are over the top and only care about you!  All were eager to engage and assist, mostly proactively at that!  Concierge check in was over the top.  Food and restaurant staff were overly accommodating, and assistance to find local tourist locations and restaurants was was more than helpful and accurate.  I really don't think I have been treated better at any hotel in the world!  Fortunately ran into the GM of hotel at departure who proactively asked us about our visit.  He gave me a great chance to gush about what a jewel he is managing and convey how extraordinary his staff delivers, is trained, and cares about their guests.   A must stay event! By the way, the room was perfect and had all of the expected ammenities for such a great stay, plus more!",5,2015,11,28
18,Nice Hotel and Great Location,Small but nice place to stay with an incredibly friendly and helpful staff.  We really enjoyed our 2 day stay here.  Roof top bar has nice views of the marina and beach area. Staff was knowledgeable about the area and really helped us out. Best hotel value in Barcelona in my opinion.,5,2015,11,27
18,Wonderful honeymoon,"I've travelled around the world and stayed at many 5* hotels which have been excellent. I can't help but feel however you a merely a customer. At the Serras you feel part of the family whilst always being treated courteously. The staff here are so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much for them. Location is perfect. 10 mins from La Rambla, the port and situated right in the gothic quarter. We stayed in a deluxe room with great views of the port. The room itself is clean, modern but with a homely twist. A glass of cava from the manager on arrival and a guided tour of the hotel was a lovely touch. The food at informal is amazing. We dined on our first night but the star of the show has to be breakfast. Wonderful. 

Now go and book this place IMMEDIATLEY!!!!!",5,2015,11,25
18,11/2015 Visit to The Serras,"My wife and I bookended a cruise with a 3 night and then 4 night stay. The Serras reminds me of the Dylan in Amsterdam with its charming intimacy (room count 30), impeccable design, great restaurant, incredible staff, and fantastic location. Every room has a balcony which places you immediately into the sights and sounds of the Gothic Quarter. The hotel is blocks from the Born area with its Santa Maria del Mar gothic church and excavation of ruins from Philip V. Across the street from the ruins is the Parc de la Ciutadella with its zoo, lake, museum, beautiful fountain, and Parliament of Catalonia. One block further is the beach and ,I was told, a casino. A few blocks in the other direction is La Rambla. Across the street is the marina. To the West is the cathedral, Placa Catalunya, high end shopping, the university area with its trendy dining, and so much more. The roof has a pool and terrace overlooking the marina.
The truly best part of the hotel is the wonderful staff. Antonio and Ona are the managers of the Serras and the have chosen a finer staff than I could ever imagine. I call them by name as you will if you visit as they are always present with a smile and desire to make your stay memorable. I have learned the names of almost the entire staff as they will eagerly fulfill any request such as where is the closest wine store, where should I go, what should I see, can you make a reservation for me, etc. I even left an important bag which they are mailing to me in the US. One other area of note at The Serras is the great value you receive for your room rate. Travel can be daunting with different customs and practices. I had thought I would hire a guide for help with these peculiarities. The staff spent extended time with me and I never missed the guide. You will be greeted with a glass of cava (bubbly wine) in the lobby, orange juice and pastries in your room, and a small dessert every night. One day we received a bottle of cava and pastries. I was loitering in the lobby 1 day and the 1st thing Sergio asked me was if I wanted a glass of cava. Suffice it to say I enjoyed the hotel. My guess is that you will also.",5,2015,11,23
18,Great Hotel,"wonderful hospitality
little extras - cakes and cava where brought to our room without extra charge
great location - 2 min. walking from the Rambla, 5 min. walking from barceloneta beach
staff is great and helped with recommendations where to visit and eat",5,2015,11,23
18,"Beautiful, new hotel - very modern, and good location","This hotel was very nice, and Picasso once had a studio there.  It was walking distance to many attractions; close to the hop-on-hop-off bus stops as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.  The added treats in the room were great.",5,2015,11,22
18,Awesome,"Simply one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed at. The room was beautiful, the location was great, the restaurant was fantastic, and the staff simply could not have been nicer, more hospitable or more helpful. From the call I received the day before we left the States, to the arrangements they made for a rental car (including negotiating the price and bringing it down by hundreds of dollars!) everything about this hotel was fantastic. I rarely write reviews of anything, but this place deserves it!",5,2015,11,16
18,First class European hotel,"My partner booked this hotel for a two night stay, and was a superb choice.

The location was perfect for wandering to points of interest in Barcelona. 

The staff from the moment we arrived to when we left were courteous, professional yet friendly and could not do enough for us.

On arrival we were offered a glass of cava and after checking in we were given a full tour of the hotel and facilities by the receptionist.

The room was compact but perfect in every way, my other half had ordered a bottle of cava before we arrived which was waiting for us with a selection of fresh delicious fruit and a hand written note from the manager.

We dined in the hotel restaurant and the meal was perfect. It was possibly one of the best meals I have had and certainly in my top 5. 

The breakfast was also excellent with great choice and attention to detail. 

The roof top terrace is beautiful.

The decor throughout is fabulous and without fault. 

My only disappointment was leaving!!!!

I really hope my partner treats me to another stay at this perfect boutique hotel. 

Thank you to all the staff for making our stay fabulous.",5,2015,11,14
18,A lovely hotel with wonderful staff and service,Stayed in the Serras in May for 5 nights. Lovely hotel in central location. Modern facilities and lovely touches like treats with turn down service and surprise complimentary  bottle of cava and fruit bowl in the room on arrival. The very best part of our stay was the experience of staff hospitality and friendliness from being introduced to the hotel on arrival to the end of our visit. The staff really make this a 5* hotel. Truely a wonderful experience.,5,2015,11,14
18,Spacious and comfortable,"We splurged on The Serras for the last 2 nights of our Barcelona visit and it was worth every penny. The hotel is well located on the Waterfront between Les Rambles and Via Laietana.

We were in a Grand Deluxe room and it was very spacious, with a nice sitting area and a very large bathroom and shower. Super comfortable and offered a great place to relax at the end of long days of sightseeing. The roof deck offered great sea views and was really nice at sunrise. The roof deck area is not normally open at sunrise, but a helpful staff member granted us access to enjoy the early morning view. The roof deck bar was also a relaxing place to enjoy a pre dinner cocktail. The free wi fi was very reliable.

The hotel staff was very welcoming and helpful. We also ate in the attached restaurant, Informal, one evening and the food and staff there were excellent as well.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks to The Serras for providing a great location to wrap up our vacation.",5,2015,11,11
18,Only Place to stay in Barcelona!,"Absolutely lovely hotel with excellent facilities and friendly staff. They really could not do enough for you. We were picked up from the airport by a driver who rang ahead to say that we had been picked up and when we would arrive. On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly member of staff and a glass of cava.
The receptionists showed us where everything was and booked tickets  for a museum were also printed out for us.
The breakfasts were fantastic. Juice, tea or coffee, fruit, and pastries were brought to your table and then you could have a choice of eggs and other breads, juices, meats. The staff all spoke excellent English and other languages.
The room was well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom and shower wonderful. 
I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel and cannot speak highly enough of the welcome and friendliness of the staff. This is a great place to stay and the only place I would stay if I was to return to Barcelona.",5,2015,11,09
18,Top Ten Reasons Why You Should Stay at The Serras,"10.  Amazing car service from the airport. Our driver picked us up in a shiny new Mercedes, called the hotel en route to give our estimated time of arrival.
9.  The wonderful, warm welcome. Upon arrival to the hotel, no fewer than three associates were waiting for us. A great bell person, Juan, took our bags.
8.  Comfortable, quick check in. Silvinia had glasses of cava waiting for us and the check in process was fun and done at the comfort of a table in a plush chair.
7.  The great property tour and escort to the room. Carolina gave us the grand tour of the hotel and provided some great onfo and recommendations for Barcelona. 
6. Complimentary upgrade. The hotel was not completely full so we were given an upgrade to a junior suite...so decadent!
5.  Amazing amenities. From the handwritten welcome note, fruit basket, bottle of cava, amazing bed, Nespresso machine in room...the list goes on.
4.  Hotel location. Ten minute walk to the beach, five minutes to Las Ramblas, close to cruise ship port. Very convenient to shopping, bars, and wonderful tapas restaurants.
3.  Cleanliness. This is huge for me as I am a self professed germ phobe. The room was immaculate, as was the entire hotel.
2.  Roof top terrace. So cool! Amazing views of Barcelona, complete with a pool and bar.
1.  Impeccable customer service. This HAD to be #1. The definition of great customer service to us is anticipating a guest's needs before they do. The Serras does this so well. The GM certainly does set the example, he took the time to speak to us and asked how our stay was. The entire staff is so hard working, authentic in their approach, and exceeded our expectations. 

We will recommend the Serras to our friends and family and will return for sure! ",5,2015,11,08
18,A MUST GO. BLISSFUL EXPERIENCE,"My experience at The Serras was pure bliss. The hotel exudes elegance and class in a very subtle and refined way. It also is a very trendy hotel. An Impeccable staff that had the exact balance of professionalism, efficiency and friendliness. The amenities  were of finest taste and quality from sheets, toiletries and basically every single small detail was delivered to perfection. This hotel did not leave any single detail out. The design of the room and furniture is amazing and the beds are just so comfortable. Location was perfect and all attractions were a good walking distance around us.  

Breakfast was out of this world. The way it is presented just speaks of refined taste and adds to the experience. You can tell that every ingredient is well selected and of highest quality. I don't think I ever tasted such a whole wheat croissant that literally melts in your mouth.

The rooftop experience was amazing. The hotel has a  beautiful  rooftop with breathtaking views especially during sunset. You just don't want to leave and time stops at some point.

This is hotel experience at its best. I would definitely come back and highly recommend this hotel to everyone that has a knack for subtle, refined and beautiful taste.",5,2015,11,06
18,A Fantastic Hotel,"This was a truly lovely hotel with exceptional customer service. The staff cannot do enough for you whatever your need may be. I am disabled and found the room accommodated my needs by providing wide doors and a chair in the shower. The food was delicious - being gluten intolerant I was provided with alternative options all really delicious and nothing was too much trouble. The staff make this hotel special by there amazing customer service which you really cannot fault - Carolena, Daniel and Viv to name but a few! 

The terrace has great views and with the option of a small outside pool or heating if you feel a little chilly whilst admiring the view supping a good glass of wine! 

The location works perfectly for access to all the local sights and the Marina.....I highly recommend this hotel and will go back one day!",5,2015,11,05
18,"Amazing staff, Beautiful boutique","At The Hotel Serras, the staff are the most friendly and accommodating people; the small but well kept boutique style hotel is clean and warm, and the location is perfect and easy to find. Extremely comfortable rooms with a wonderful surprise of white chocolate strawberries and champagne upon arrival. The boutique is not too far from the ocean (you can see it from the rooftop and your room depending on it's location), and located in the Bari-Gothic, which has some amazing buildings and places to which I would positively recommended also visiting. I would recommend The Hotel Serras to any traveler (family, friends, business) because of the diversity and room availability it holds. The Serras has a gorgeous rooftop bar & restaurant with a pool looking over the city. The pool was quite small, but I didn't expect anything bigger for the size of the hotel. I would POSITIVELY recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay or visit the area. It is an incredible place that I cannot wait to return to! ",5,2015,11,03
18,Our New Favorite Barcelona Rooftop Bar,"This is a fairly new, upscale boutique hotel in an ideal location near the seafront. We did not stay at the hotel but visited the rooftop bar twice. Gorgeous view of the harbor, amazing GinTonics, and a variety of delicious tapas. It's the perfect spot to sip a cocktail and chill. Our final day, we stopped by for lunch on the terrace, food was excellent with attentive service by Julia, our lovely waitress. The hotel's service, food, decor - all top notch. A great new spot to try out in Barcelona. Highly recommended.",5,2015,11,01
18,Great boutique hotel,"Spent 4 nights at The Serras for my honeymoon in October 2015. Hotel is very nice, well decorated in a modern style. Staff is very  friendly and helpful, booking dinner reservations for us and being prompt with requests. We booked a grand deluxe room which was a nice size for 2--very large bathroom with dual sinks. Breakfast was included  with our room and it was delicious, filling and fresh. Location is good, some great restaurants located in the Born area a short walk away. 

Cons:
Prior to my arrival date, I received no less then 5 emails asking if I was coming for a special occasion and who I was traveling with.  Each time I informed the hotel that I was coming for my honeymoon with my wife. I had read several reviews on trip advisor how the hotel had upgraded the room for special occasions or left a bottle of cava with fruit in the room. So my expectations were high. I was a little underwhelmed when I got to my room to find a note from the manager and 4 cookies.  

Overall, hotel is very good and we had a lovely stay. ",5,2015,11,01
18,A truly exceptional hotel,"A fabulous hotel in a great location. The food was excellent and the roof top bar was a great place to relax with a drink and enjoy the great view. Our room was very comfortable and the contemporary decor was fresh and stylish. What makes this hotel so special is the staff who offer a really personal experience - from the tour of the hotel on arrival, to the help with planning our itinerary and the booking of admission tickets, to even organising replacement bus tickets, nothing was too much trouble. ",5,2015,10,30
18,Luxurious Hotel with Boutique Feel,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in. 

You are only 15/20 minutes by taxi from the airport and a speedy yet comfortable check in process with Cava followed by a short tour of the hotel leads you to your room. Everything was spotless and staff were ever so polite. 

We were hungry on the first evening but a little tired after flying so opted for room service which didn't disappoint. The food is of a very high standard and the usual extortionate charges didn't apply. We also opted to dine in the hotel for breakfast the next morning and again, were not disappointed - the menu is extensive and delicious. 

You will not be disappointed by this hotel, we found the area lovely and walked everywhere. The service, cleanliness and quality are all of the highest standard. Highly recommend and we hope to return very soon!",5,2015,10,30
18,Our new favourite hotel in Barcelona,"Having read all the wonderful reviews we had very high expectations and were not disappointed. The hotel is modern and very stylish overlooking a marina. It is on a busy, noisy road, but the windows are soundproofed so it blocks out the noise. We were welcomed by genuine warmth from the front desk team and offered a glass of cava whilst we checked in, and although our room wasn't ready we were taken on a quick tour of the hotel and then sat on the amazing roof terrace in the sunshine overlooking the marina until it was ready. The restaurant is amazing so would recommend booking as it gets full.  The only suggestion I would make is to provide more storage/drawer space so that you can unpack properly - there is plenty of hanging space but nowhere to put smaller items.  Overall fantastic service, team, location and this has become our new favourite hotel in Barcelona",5,2015,10,30
18,top,"One of the best places to stay and enjoy this beautiful city. Close to the sea, shopping areas and famous spots, this nice and friendly hotel is one of the best experiences you can have whenever you want to introduce and embrace yourself with that amazing city. Kindly staff, always ready to help and the most important thing, not easy to find in Spain, they speak several languages! Will recommend for sure.",5,2015,10,29
18,Best hotel!!,"We love to stay in boutique hotels, all very special but this hotel was really something special. The atmosphere when you walk in tells you everything, you are in good hands. Everybody smiles from the first person you meet, at restaurant and everybody you cross in between. On top of it, location is perfect!",5,2015,10,27
18,Maravilhoso hotel!,"Great hotel from start to finish! We stayed with some friends and had the best time ever. The staff is very nice and helpful, they organized from tickets to Sagrada Familia from restaurant reservations and were always ready to help. The rooms have a very nice deco, modern but cozy and the location is the best in town. 15 minutes from the airport and 2 minutes walk to the Cathedral, the shopping area. Rooftop was to die for! Great views, nice pool and best cocktails! The Restaurant is exceptional, we eat there 4 times!!",5,2015,10,26
18,Best hotel ever,My girlfriend chose this hotel after reading many comments online and they deserve all the good comments. This hotel is something special. From the very first email to the goodbye at the car you feel something special. We didn't want to leave!,5,2015,10,24
18,Cozy Elegance and Friendly,"We finished our recent visit to Spain at The Serras Hotel. One word to describe it would be Cozy. The staff was super friendly and helpful from doorman to reception and anxious to assist in any way possible. Each Night a small treat was left at the bedside to let you know they were thinking of you.

The rooms were well decorated with a modern bathroom and comfortable beds. The shower was outstanding with large ceiling type fixture. Robes and slippers were provided. Our one dinner was in front of hotel in patio and food was superb and waitress delightful. She explained that this newish hotel was a family operation. They indeed earned their Michelin star. 

Their is an upstairs casual dining spot and a small unheated pool w bar on rooftop. I would stay again if given the opportunity.",5,2015,10,24
18,Where do i start?,"I stayed here before and after my cruise out of Barcelona for our honeymoon.  My wife and I loved this hotel! I spent more on a hotel in Miami that's top of the line but it's nothing compared to the Serras in Barcelona! 

Location location location! It's a big city but this place has plenty in walking distance. If you want to see the highlights of the city. The hop on and off bus stop is a 3 mins walk from the hotel. buy a ticket and jump on to see everything it has to offer. There's so much nearby it's too much to write lol.

It's about 20-30mins drive with traffic to/from airport. 
When we arrived we were offered an upgrade to a junior suite. It's has good room size for a hotel in Europe. Everything was very clean and very modern designs. Big shower. Nice one person Jacuzzi. and much more.  

The whole staff is great! Very helpful, knowledgeable and quick.
They all spoke English pretty well too. It's not a problem for us, we speak Spanish, but I think that's good info to include for other travelers that don't know Spanish.  

Regarding El Informal restaurant! When you book your stay here ask for a reservation for at least one dinner to try it. You won't be disappointed. I'm the type of person to go out and explore the hidden gems of the city. But the first night we got there I decided to get a reservation to at least try it.  We are very happy to eat at El Informal. And honestly it wasn't as pricey as I expected for the quality of the food and service. 

Oh and a special thanks to Rebeca who helped us out with almost everything. And thanks to a great staff for the warm welcome during our honeymoon.",5,2015,10,23
18,Pure luxury ,"Myself an hubby returned from a short trip to Barcelona ,we stayed at The Serras based on trip advisor reviews   .We have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world and have to say this hotel was spot on .Upon  arrival we were greeted with cheerful happy staff and a glass of cava . Booking  in was swift and staff showed us around the hotel and helped us get our bearings . This hotel is situated in perfect area of Barcelona just a short stroll to la ramblas and gothic quarter behind hotel . We had a junior suite which was  large ,light and airy for European standards and the  most comfortable bed ever !! .  Our Room very quite over looking a quaint  historic street . Every single member of staff went out of their way to make our holiday one to remember . Informal restaurant  good especially  the sausage and black pudding signature dish . We had breakfast morning which set us up for the day of site seeing and had evening drinks on roof top bar with a good selection of cocktails and whisky ,bar set around outdoor heaters and comfy cushions  .we will be coming back to this hotel in future .Every member should be very proud of the level of service that is given to each an every customer in this beautiful hotel ",5,2015,10,23
18,Service exceptional,"Our stay started with a personalized greeting from Daniel as he approached our taxi, he knew us by name which shows the attention to detail. Carolina checked us in with a glass of Cava and a tour of the hotel and as we awaited our room to be ready Anna came to us on the rooftop bar with a hot cup of tea and honey for my husbands sore throat.  What a lovely gesture and this was so unexpected and greatly appreciated. The staff were exceptional and our stay could not have been better.  If you stay at Hotel Serras you will enjoy first class service, even the Hotel owner made a point of introducing himself, we can only say a heartfelt thank you and wish you many years of success you so deserve!
Almost forgot our room and the entire hotel was spotless and the bed so incredibly comfortable we slept in way too late!",5,2015,10,23
18,Beautiful Anniversary Visit,"This gorgeous boutique hotel will not disappoint - the staff are amazingly helpful and friendly, rooms are beautifully furnished and the bars and restaurant are really good. A great location, just a short walk from both the seafront and La Rambla, we couldn't have asked for anything more. Would happily recommend to anyone looking for something a bit different and a really special stay.
",5,2015,10,22
18,Cool digs,"This place is downright cool. It has a very positive vibe. It's located directly across from the marina. Turn right and it's a short stroll to la Rambla, left and you are in the Gothic district. This place is chic and clearly focused on superior service. Everyone speaks  English. As you may have heard - rooms in Europe are notoriously small. That is not the case here. The rooftop bar affords a spectacular view of the marina. We left to sight-see during the day and returned to a plate of fresh fruit and a bottle of Cava. Above all what really makes this place notable is the outstanding staff. Forget the major names, this is where you want to stay.",5,2015,10,22
18,Bbbbb,"Nice hotel i like it too much,its clean,classy & classy, i wish to go there again and stay much more time ,and about the who is.working there they are so proffessional and kind they know how to take care of their guests",5,2015,10,22
18,Excellent boutique hotel,"The hotel is located opposite the old harbour and at the entrance of the gotic area.
The hotel is small,brand new and modern.
The staff is extremely friendly.the rooms are nicely furnished and the entire hotel expresses taste and comfort.The hotel also has a very good restaurant and a nice roof top pool and terrace.So.what else can you wish for a stay in Barcelona?",5,2015,10,21
18,"Incredible, faultless boutique hotel! ","I stayed here with my partner for a week, and I can honestly say that this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  

I stayed in a grand deluxe room which was huge.  It was spotless, with a massive bed, huge shower, lovely Marina view too.  We had a bottle of bubbles on arrival in our room with fruit, and a hand written personal note welcoming us.   

The staff were excellent, they were so attentive, and were so helpful and friendly.  The Rooftop bar was cool too, a nice surprise, with amazing views of the harbour, and great cocktails too.  The Informal restaurant was awesome too, incredible food! 
 
It's the attention to detail from everything from the staff, to the room layout and design of this hotel which was what blew me away.  I can't recommend staying here enough!   

It's only about a year old I believe, and the price we paid was amazing for the service and room we received.  I only hope the prices don't go up too much as it gets busier, as if I'm in Barcelona again, I'll definitely be trying to book The Serras!!",5,2015,10,20
18,"Wonderful, modern, upscale hotel right across from the Marina","Terrific, new boutique hotel.  Tasteful public areas.  Very nice room with small sitting area and balcony. Air conditioned, sound proofed, $$ mini bar, safe, robes and nice amenities.
We were greeted by a very friendly doorman who whisked our bags away and then immediately offered us complimentary OJ, Cava or water while we sat down to check in . Nice touch as was the bottle of complimentary Cava and fruit in our room ! The front desk staff were young, polite, informative and very friendly.  We didn't eat in the restaurant at all. We thought $24 Euros per person for breakfast was very high.   I would have enjoyed a less expensive offering of coffee and pastries to start the day. 

The location is terrific !  Right across from the marina and close to the hop on hop off bus stops.  Easy to walk to the Gothic district for tapas.   Highly recommend that area over the Las Ramblas for eats and shopping. We did enjoy a good dinner paella along the Marina.  Hotel arranged for our Sagrada tickets and hop on hop off tickets.  So convenient !  Beautiful city and hope to be back.",5,2015,10,19
18,A second home away from home,"This is a wonderful hotel. Luxurious. Located perfectly. The staff are amazing. Helpful, kind and so very genuine. The rooms are beautiful. And clean. The bed fit for a queen. The restaurant offers delicious food, and the rooftop bar is perfect for a sundowner. And even when it's chilly, a mobile fireplace keeps you warm. I can recommend the shrimp carpaccio. Exquisite. And yes, you can stay here with small children. Absolutely no hassle. The cot on wheels was perfect. You have a question, go ahead and ask. Because no doubt the staff at the Serras will have a solution.",5,2015,10,19
18,Impressive ,Great location. Staff was very sweet and helpful.  The rooms not a bad size for Europe.  Very modern touch.  The gym was very bad and small like 10'x10' at max that's only thing stopping the 5 star rating.  Turn down service was preformed in a timely matter.  ,4,2015,10,19
18,A wonderful new (eight month old) hotel in a great location.,"We stayed in mid-August.  The rooms are modern and fresh, with extremely comfortable beds, a sitting area (in the deluxe rooms), and roomy bathrooms.  The hotel sits on the edge of the Barri Gotic facing the old port – about a 15-20 minute walk to the beach and about a 10 minute walk to the City History Museum or the Columbus monument, which to us was a perfect location.  The location would be less than perfect if your focus was in the Eixample (for shopping and Modernist architecture).  The staff was consistently friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is outstanding, and includes both a very high quality buffet (pastries, meats, cheeses, fresh juices) and fresh fruit, breads and hot dishes served from the kitchen.  The roof terrace is pleasant, with a small pool, a bar, and a nice view over the Port Vell area.",5,2015,10,17
18,Absolutely wonderful,"This hotel was an immaculate experience from the very beginning. We spent our honeymoon here and arrived just two days after the wedding, early in the morning, happy but very tired. The staff went over their ways to make us feel welcome from the very beginning and stayed ever so friendly and warm throughout our stay. Everything felt personal without being a ""show off"". The room was beautiful and the bed was to die for. The rooftop terrace offered a wonderful view and don't even get me started on the breakfast - absolutely delicious. Five out of five - and I'd like to rate it higher! Will be back, for sure.",5,2015,10,17
18,"Qualidade, muito bom, Maravilhoso","This place is the perfect choice for any Brazilian looking for a  high level service in a chic and trendy set. I would say is the Fasano of Barcelona. The rooftop amazing, the service is great and the rooms and decor multi muito bom.",5,2015,10,17
18,Ticks every box,"It is not just the location,it is the total concept, welcoming staff well equipped rooms excellent amenities a great team of people that are genuinely interested in making your visit and stay memorable and enjoyable, I learnt about it via Trip Advisor and it is just excellent.",5,2015,10,14
18,Picasso was here,"I loved my stay at the Serras  hotel. Every detail was thought about. From the moment I arrived I was made to feel special a Cava as we checked in, booking all the events we wished to visit and the room was glorious. I spent the rest of the day lounging by the roof pool in the warm Barcelona sun reading a book. We spent 4 days there and when we checked out it was like leaving home as the staff was there to say goodbye. I would live there if I could.",5,2015,10,14
18,First rate trendy luxury hotel on the edge of the Gothic District,"Although this was not the least expensive hotel of our three week trip to Europe, it was a great value and a really great way to end the trip feeling pampered and relaxed.  The Serras is less than a year old and boasts only 28 rooms and an informal high cuisine restaurant with a Michelin starred chef (the restaurant is too new for a star).

I was impressed when the hotel called my cell phone 4 days in advance to see if there was anyway they could improve our stay with preparations in advance.  They asked why were coming and if there was anything special we were celebrating - (there was - my husband's birthday). 

We arrived with a rental auto to drop off our luggage to discover that it fronted a very busy avenue and parking even to unload seemed impossible.  The doorman was out to the curb immediately and relaxed and told us not to worry but just to put on the hazard lights and park a few moments.  He promptly took our luggage inside and the desk staff greeted us immediately, checked us in, found out who we were and told us to go ahead and take the car back, our luggage would be in the room when we returned.  They also gave us a map, told us how to use the subway and sent us on our way.

When we returned to the hotel, our luggage was in the room, the desk clerk took us up to the room and showed us around it and left us to relax.  We found a bottle of champagne and a bowl of fruit waiting in the room along with a kind note welcoming us and wishing my husband happy birthday.  The room had a large bed, enormous TV, small desk, small couch and a chair, espresso machine, and a large bathroom with separate toilet and shower rooms.  The WC included a bidet and the main bathroom had a double sink.  The room also had a large built in wardrobe with drawers, bathrobes, turn down service with a snack and bottled water each night and a small balcony with french doors. 

The hotel also had a small gym, two bars and a fine restaurant. Breakfast was a little dear at Eur 24 for the buffet (less for continental) but it was well worth it and clearly came form the same kitchen that prepared the main restaurant meals.  This was by far the best breakfast we had anywhere in Europe, beautifully set out and served and included, meats, cheeses, pastries, unusual and delicious juices (green apple, lime and spinach for example) and a hot entree of your choice plus the usual breads and pastires and excellent coffee - as much as you wanted.  I'd come to this hotel restaurant just for breakfast!

The ambiance of the hotel was very trendy, with soft trendy music playing in public areas, nicely aromatic and upscale high design features, but still the price averaged unders EUR 300 for the nights we were there - a bargain for this level of service and quality, though a bit dear for Spain. The location is also great - right on the edge of the Gothic District and a short walk from two metros, so we found we could get to Sagreda Familie, for example in just 15 minutes door to door. 

When we are next in Barcelona, it will be the first place I look for accommodation.",5,2015,10,12
18,"Beautiful hotel, amazing service!","2 weeks before our arrival, the hotel contacted us to see if there was anything we might need to make our stay more enjoyable.  It only got better from there:  our driver met us at the airport, we were greeted by the friendliest, most professional staff ever who provided us with bubbly as we checked in.  Our room was beautiful - well appointed, the bed was divine and the rooftop pool and bar didn't disappoint.  The view at night from the roof is awesome! The staff helped us make reservations for shows and tours and I can't say enough wonderful things about them!  They truly understand the concept of customer service! The hotel's location is perfect for walking around La Rambla and it's a short walk to the beach.   It was my first trip to Barcelona and I'm looking forward to my next one - which will include another stay at The Serras.   You can't go wrong with this one - worth every penny!",5,2015,10,11
18,Absolutely amazing.,From the moment we walked in until the moment we checked out the staff of the hotel took care of us and everything for us that we needed help with. I cant even find words to praise the staff well enough. We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we visit Barcelona. This is how a 5-star hotel should work. And for the love of god don't miss out on their breakfast buffet. ;),5,2015,10,11
18,Drinks,"Firstly we would like to apologise to the hotel - we had a booking for dinner but unfortunately my wife had a minor accident and we couldn't make it , very disappointed - On a better note we had attended the Hotel earlier that day and shared a nice bottle of fizz on the rooftop terrace - we both agree that the staff generally make a place and you can forgive certain issues if they are dealt with well - the staff we encountered at The Serras couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome and provide a level of service that makes you want to return again & again - we come to Barcelona regularly and have stayed in other 5* hotels and The Serras is up there with the best - we will return next year and hope it to be more successful when it comes to dinner !!",5,2015,10,10
18,perfect to the last dot,"From the moment you walk in the service is superb. Everyone is professionally dressed and you can tell they take pride in their work. The rooms are beautiful and relaxing. The shower is ""to die for""! Every amenity you can think of, bed is like sleeping on a cloud. Walking distance to La Rambla and many attractions. Hop on Hop off bus across the street. Well worth the money.",5,2015,10,09
18,Prepare to be wowed,"Having travelled through some rather unsavoury districts on the way from the airport to the hotel, we were a little concerned about our own hotel and its location.  Any fears we had were quickly allayed the minute we drew up outside The Serras.  Our cases were whisked inside by the hotel staff and we were greeted by the most delightful receptionist.  After a welcome drink and a brief tour of the hotel, we were shown to our superb room.  The hotel only opened in January this year and everything is pristine.  The beds and pillows were luxuriously comfortable.  The bathroom was roomy, tastefully decorated with some unusual touches.  There was a coffee machine in the room but only espresso was on offer, which wasn't to our taste.  Speaking as someone who likes a cuppa now and then, I would have preferred a kettle but a minor point and when in Rome......The spread at breakfast was extensive and very good quality.  I can't imagine that there could possibly be anything one would want that wasn't on offer.  We ate in the restaurant one night too.  The food was excellent and easily the best we had during our stay in Barcelona.  The reception staff were particularly friendly and often went the extra mile to assist.  This hotel is well situated for the old town, Las Ramblas and the Marina.  Highly recommended.",5,2015,10,08
18,Just lovely,"We stayed at The Serras earlier this year, it is without doubt the best hotel we have stayed at in Barcelona.  The staff were so attentive and our room was lovely, the little cakes and fresh fruit on arrival were such a lovely touch.  The rooftop bar is great, especially at sunset.  We've already booked our next trip back ;)",5,2015,10,08
18,Great small hotel with very helpful staff,Although we stayed only one night after a long Mediterranean cruise the staff of the hotel was very welcoming. It has only 28 rooms but they are large and extremely comfortable. It is in a very central location. You will not find a better hotel any where.,5,2015,10,05
18,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"Just got home from a 4 night stay in Barcelona. The Serras was in a perfect location near the waterfront. You walk out the front door to a beautiful view and its an easy walk to anywhere you want to go. Also a beautiful view and relaxing atmosphere on the rooftop lounge. The room and bed were very comfortable and the shower was the best. But what really sets this hotel apart are the people. The size of the hotel was very inviting and it lent itself to a very personal feeling of interaction with the staff. From the maid service to reception, door men, restaurant servers, concierges, managers all were fantastic. The smiles were every where and they always had great info and always took the time to talk. You were always left feeling that you were very important to them. If I ever go back to Barcelona I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Serras again. As I was told leaving the Serras, this is your home in Barcelona.",5,2015,10,04
18,Amazing hotel and exceptional staff!,"Dear Mr. Antonio B., 
I would like to personally thank you for a wonderful and memorable experience at your hotel.  The room was beautifully decorated, immaculate, and exceeded my expectations for an entry level room.  We slept like babies in the super comfortable king size beds after long days of sightseeing in your beautiful city.  We were most impressed with the professionalism all of your staff-front desk, restaurant servers, and housekeeping. The staff was extremely helpful, especially when I accidentally blew up the electricity in my room with my curling iron-whoops! The front desk staff also helped us to book tickets to the FC Barcelona game.  My husband LOVES futbol and had never been to a live game.  We had the best seats in the house and an experience we will never forget!  I would also like to give a special thanks to Guilia (spelling?) our server at the rooftop restaurant/bar.  She was very kind, pleasant and quick to accommodate our requests.  The Serras is easily the best hotel we have stayed at. We have stayed at other fine five star hotels such as The Four Seasons and the Mercer in NYC but the excellent customer service and the intimate setting makes this hotel stand out amongst the hundreds of hotels in Barcelona. Our 10 day stay at your hotel was the perfect way to celebrate our early retirement.  We are already planning our return visit next year!
Warm regards,
Susan Choi and Michael Robinson
September 20-29th

P.S.-I was surprised to read the negative review by Mrs. Dixit-""Meena D"".  I think we were staying there around the same time and am really surprised at her negative comments.  The staff was extremely helpful and very quick to respond to any request.  I would not give any credence to her comments and negativity.  Clearly, her requests were unreasonable and out of your control.",5,2015,10,03
18,"Great location, excellent hotel in Barrio Gotico","We recently visited Barcelona and stayed at The Serras for 4 nights during La Merce festival. The location was ideal with a 5 minute walk to metro (Drassanes),  Barceloneta, Cathedral, La Rambla and across the street from Port Vell.

The staff was friendly and on top of all details, making us feel right at home. It has a small boutique feel. We did not eat at the restaurant so I cannot comment. The rooftop deck was lovely and a great place to relax after coming back from the day with lounges and shade to be found, the pool is small although that was not important to us. The views of Passeig de Colom and the port are fantastic especially at night.

Our room had a small balcony at the back of the building which opened to a small street behind the hotel. The doors to the balcony kept the room quiet. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely.

We will definitely look into staying there again when we go back to Barcelona.",5,2015,10,03
18,Incredible,THis Hotel is incredible. We were amazed by the lovely large suite and the bed was too confy. The public área are problably the best of any hotel here. We had every night cocktals en 9Bar or en rooftop always Gorgeous presentation,5,2015,10,03
18,Wonderful hotel!,"This is a wonderful hotel! It is located near the harbor in a very pleasant area. The hotel is very new. The room we had was lovely, with an exceptionally comfortable bed and a luxurious bathroom. However, it was quite small with very little view, but we had chosen the basic category. The best feature was the exceptional staff who were so kind and helpful!",5,2015,10,02
18,Amazing hotel,"My husband and I booked this hotel as a little mini-honeymoon straight after our honeymoon, and the service is truly amazing. We where contacted before our arrival and asked if we needed anything special for our arrival. Our room a junior-suite is cozy and trendy at the same time. The bed amazing, and a lovely sofa for relaxing. At our room there was complementary Cava and fruit due to our recent wedding, a lovely surprise. The staff is very helpfull and offer to help in anyway they can. Rooservice twice a day, with making of the bed in the morning, and preparing for night with a little botle of water and a small slice of cake in the evening. 
Short distance to the metro, and la rambla. 

I only have good things to say about this hotel, and will defenitly come back!",5,2015,09,30
18,Fantastic Hotel,"Our stay surpassed our expectations. The quality, friendliness of staff and attention to detail was exceptional. 
The staff were helpful, customer service skills are second to none, knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble. So many extra little touches make this an amazing hotel experience.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay from opening the taxi door we were made so welcome to leaving every moment was a complete pleasure and look forward to staying with you again in the future.
Our room was amazing quality clean well appointed with an extremely comfortable large bed.
The hotel is ideally positioned 5 minutes walk to the restaurants at the marina or 10 - 15 minutes walk through the Gothic area to the centre of Barcelona.
We highly recommend The Serras for an enjoyable stay in Barcelona",5,2015,09,29
18,Amzing Hotel in an Amazing City,"My Husband and I stayed at this hotel from the 20th-24th September this year as a celebratory trip for his 30th Birthday and our First wedding anniversary and what can I say?? From the minute we arrived until the minute we left the staff were 5* to match the beautiful hotel. This hotel is perfectly located for anyone wanting to explore the city only a few streets away from La Ramblas and sits directly opposite the Stunning Port. 

As the hotel only opened in January it is very modern and perfectly decorated, the rooftop bar was amazing and we spent a lot of time chilling there in the heat. I was blown away by the hotel and the customer service and would definitely not look at anywhere else to stay if I returned to Barcelona. 

If I had to criticize anything the only thing I could think would be that the bar prices at the rooftop bar were a lot more expensive to the bar downstairs, the restaurant or even the mini bar. I understand the rooftop is an exclusive area of the hotel but I don't think its fair to charge residents extra to drink up there than anywhere else. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel even taking that into account so if your looking to book The Serras - don't hesitate!!",5,2015,09,29
18,I will definitely not look at any other accomodation options next time I go to Barcelona,"When we were looking for a hotel we chose The Serras, because it had very good reviews on tripadvisor. We really enjoyed the stay there, because the rooms were spacious and new. The overall impression of the hotel is that it was very stylish and cosy. The breakfast is delicious and the staff is very friendly (especially the girls on reception and the bellboys), they provide more care than usually in the other hotels. They really take take initiative to help and explain how to get around the town and etc. Just out of our curiosity we went to the W Hotel Barcelona to see what we missed out, and after visiting the hotel - we really came to the conclusion that we made the right choice to stay at the Serras Hotel, because it was so dark and bad ambiance. The location was the best, because it was very close to get to the airport without having to drive through the city and it was very close to all the attractions.",5,2015,09,27
18,A big disappointment,"We spent 3 nights in this so called five star boutique hotel after reading ravishing reviews on trip adviser. 
In spite of our well in advance booking and informing  the management about the occasion of our stay with  repeated telephonic as well as e - mail communications, regarding the preference of room , we were offered standard basic room on the lower floor  with no view and small in size, under the pretext that they are full. We arrived rather late in the evening after a 6 hour train journey and were very tired but still we had to haggle out for a shade better room with a sea view . 
So we knew the culture of this hotel.
The room that we occupied  was small  with very small sized double?bed and almost negligible storage space after unpacking. This was the first most uncomfortable bed in our Spanish journey. We had to take care that we don't fall down from bed during deep sleep and side turning.

We had dinner in the hotel on our arrival night which we had to eat sitting outside as they were expecting some party in the restaurant , When any hotel is supposed to give priority to the resident guests. The food and restaurant is very expensive compared to their status.
 We would not recommend this hotel to our friends.
Our rating for this hotel is two stars .",2,2015,09,27
18,My family and I loved it!,"Hotel The Serras is a beautifully restored boutique hotel along the Marina. It is within walking distance to many sights and cool neighborhoods - Barri Gotic, Las Ramblas, El Born and the beaches of Barceloneta to name a few. 

The rooms are sleek and modern with amazing finishes ( we loved our rain head shower.) Our room had a cute little balcony that overlooked the Marina and onto the Mediterranean. The rooftop pool was just perfect for relaxing after a long day of sight seeing. 

Antonio and his staff treated us so well that we didn't want to leave! They catered to our every whim and made sure our stay was comfortable and stress free.

Thank you for an amazing stay! We look forward to returning to The Serras during our next trip to Barcelona!",5,2015,09,26
18,You don't need to look any further for a hotel...,"This hotel is a wonderful place to stay, eat, drink, relax, party....from the ultra cool Eva Martinez designed interior to the gastronomical delights and the Rooftop bar and pool, this hotel is a must. The attention to detail is breathtaking and the rooms a pure pleasure to stay in. Add to this staff that can never do too much for you and you have an unforgettable experience whether you are here for business pleasure family or couple time. The General Manager, Antonio, delights in pleasing his guests and will happily go the extra mile to make your stay the most special it can possibly be. We will most definitely be returning here very soon and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Serras to family and friends.",5,2015,09,23
18,Honeymoon ,"Fantastic place, great location, and excellent service. We stayed in suite 501 with a free standing bathtub in the middle of the room, and a beautiful view to the marina. Rooftop terrace with a pool and cocktailbar. Will be our first choice for our next stay in Barcelona.",5,2015,09,23
18,Gastronomic experance,"This hotel was a great place to stay. The staff were fantastic, could not do enough for you. Any request was dealt with smiling, with a no problem attitude. We had booked two popular restaurants a few months in advance and the reception staff helped to confirm. The Serras' own restaurant ""Informal"" was just as good if not better than Tickets / Cinc Sentits. The room was very clean and minimalist, the hotel is modern and trendy but very relaxing . The roof top terrace was a great place to have a drink and chill out over looking the marina any time of day are night . Where the hotel is situated gives you a ideal base to explore the city. The greatest compliment I can give this hotel is I would stay here again .",5,2015,09,20
18,Fantastic hotel and experience - more than excellent is an appropriate rating!,"The location was perfect - on the border of the Marina, Gothic and El Born areas and as such, a short walk to everything. The staff was exceptional - from the warm greeting and cava upon arrival, to sorting out tours and restaurant recommendations and changes. We couldn't have asked for any more! The room was beautiful and comfortable. The pool deck was the perfect place to relax at the end of the day.",5,2015,09,19
18,Truly 5 star,"This was our 10th visit to Barcelona, and we have stayed in a number of very nice hotels.  Here's what made this stay memorable:  the lovely welcome - - chilly cava,and a warm, personalized greeting. We were escorted to our room on the 5th floor.  No view to speak of, but we had opted for the lowest category of room, so that was our choice.  The room felt a bit small - - in part due to the enormous bathroom!  Amenities were excellent.  Best rainshower ever.  And the bed.  oh my the bed.  We love our bed at home, and we doubted we could find better.  Well we did. The perfect combination of firm and gentle.  Slept like a baby.

Good A/C.  excellent wifi.  charming rooftop lounge.  Delicious cocktails - - very pricey but worth the splurge.  Excellent location straddling gothic quarter and barceloneta.  Walked everywhere. We just looooooved staying there!

looking forward to returning.",5,2015,09,16
18,incredible!!!,"This is more than excellent. After 4 days in the best hotel of Madrid we were pretty scared of the selection of hotels in Barcelona. a funny american couple that we met in madrid did suggest us Serras as the best boutique hotel in the world they have been. we were impressed and therefore decided to book it! I can´t describe it enough with words. Attention to details here is an Art and Decor is a must. Breakfast was incredibly succulent but service is the outstanding point of the hotel they are all working in an amazing, funny and professional mood. I need to mention the Manager an Italian gentleman that every morning was chatting in the breakfast with us and other tables. We were all feeling in the most beautiful home. Thank you Serrass",5,2015,09,15
18,Friendly perfection!,"My husband & I stayed here as a treat to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary.
Everything was immaculate, the hotel is beautiful and unique, the atmosphere is very relaxed and informal, all of the staff are extremely friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Carolina looked after us from booking right through to check out - even remembering a spanish newspaper to take home to our son. Jan & Daniel were always on hand if we needed anything. 
The breakfasts were superb - lots of fresh fruit, pastries, cereals and a delicious selection of hot meals but the crepe with chocolate & banana is the best treat!
We had dinner in the restaurant on Saturday night - the meal was wonderful - each course was stunning to look at and even better to eat. I'm sorry I don't know the name of our helpful waiter (young guy with a stylish beard) who explained any of the dishes we didn't recognise.
Don't hesitate - this hotel is wonderful - we will be back.",5,2015,09,11
18,wonderfull hotel and best location,"The stuff welcomed us warmly and friendly and the hospitality and attention was great.
we had wonderful rooms (we had 3 rooms) well equipped .
Breakfast was fantastic and was served so nice and tasty.",5,2015,09,09
18,The best hotel in Barcelona!,"This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The rooms are beautiful and the hotel faultless but the thing that makes it stand out even more is the service. I have stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world and The Serras really stands out. The only place to stay in Barcelona. 

PS the bed is probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in",5,2015,09,06
18,Stunning hotel ,"This hotel is probably the best I've ever stayed in anywhere even beating the Waldorf Astoria in Florida and London ...really lovely staff and service impeccable. ..will definitely be returning !! The only thing I would say is we will stay in a suite facing the harbour next time as this wasn't available. 

  

     ",5,2015,09,02
18,Boutique Hotel,"First time in Barcelona with my husband when we arrived at the hotel by taxi the doorman could not attend to us fast enough ,took our bags and ushered us to the reception desk where we seated and introduced to the guest relations manager and promptly offered a glass of cava or a cold drink with great enthusiasm by Daniel.Went through the formalities and shown through the facilities of the well appointed, very small hotel(30 rooms).We were taken to our room by the guest relations manager and unfortunately we declined the room that she had allocated to us-much to our surprise as well as hers it had appeared that the previous guest had been smoking the room and was not suitable as the odour was evident, we were then shown another room then we were on our way for a couple of great days. Daniel was a great source of information and assisted us in mapping out our tour of interesting places and also booked many of them for us, he is a great asset to the hotel and the guests.",5,2015,09,02
18,beautifull lovely pearl,"By far The most lovely Little luxury hotel I have stayed in as visiting Barcelona. Just the view is splendid, beautifull rooms, excellent restaurant and pool bar at The rooftop. This is my adress for future visits in one of my favorit cities in Europe. IF you have not been here, you will love it. Thanks to the staff too,for making it such a memorable visit to the three of us.",5,2015,09,02
18,Great stay,"We decided on hotel Serras after reading the great reviews on TripAdvisor. Indeed it did not disappoint. From check in to check out, process was smooth and fuss free..drinks were offered during the check in which was a nice gesture due to the heat in Barcelona now. We booked a junior suite, room was cosy and nice but not exactly that big as compared to other suite that we had stayed in before. Love the touch button in the shower though which is easy to use and the water pressure and temperature was just right! There is even a jacuzzi available in the bath tub if you fancy. Toiletries smell great too! Breakfast was good but pricey. There are plenty of restaurants down the road. Great location walking distance to the shopping belt.",4,2015,09,02
18,Best Hotel in Barcelona,"We decided to split our trip to the Mediterranean spending 4 days in Barcelona and 4 in Mallorca, the decision couldn't have been better. 
We found The Serras on Tripadvisor and that is why we wanted to post a review. The whole experience was excellent! 

The location is the best you can find, in front of the Sea but in the City Centre, you can walk to the main attractions and come back to your Oasis. A G&T in the Rooftop is a must! Pool is not huge but enough to refresh after a long day in the city, after all you do not come to this hotel to train for the Ironman. 

We booked the Junior Suite Sea view, for the difference in rate, it is worth it. They are spacious and the decoration is exquisite. 

But the best of all is the team, they great you with a smile and this goes on during the 4 days. Nothing is too much trouble for them, they recommend restaurants and tours depending on our mood, let them guide you! 

Last but not least, the restaurant Informal, it deserves a review on its own but do not miss the breakfast.",5,2015,08,27
18,"Absolutely the BEST hotel, staff and stay!!!","This hotel ABSOLUTELY exceeded our expectations! I booked it due to the great reviews on Tripadvisor but beyond that, did not know much about the hotel.  This was SIMPLY THE BEST hotel we stayed at on our Spanish trip and also makes the Top 5 list of hotels I have EVER stayed at.  The reservation staff is amazing and they make the process so simple. Daniel, Cristina and staff took the BEST care of us! We were a family of 6 and this hotel catered to us in every way possible. Great for couples, families, business--the staff makes everyone feel comfortable and bends over backwards to please! Breakfast wonderful, concierge gave us great suggestions for food and activity. Rooftop bar/pool is on the smaller side but expected as this is a smaller, boutique hotel and is still very refreshing and hip. As stated prior, I can't think of one thing that I could change about this hotel. Located in a great part of Barcelona, across from the harbor and less than 5 mins walking to Las Ramblas. BRAVO!",5,2015,08,27
18,True to its number 1 in Barcelona status!,"Staying for four nights in the Serras was nothing less than fabulous. As a teenager staying with three friends and my parents we were treated with friendliness and nothing was too much trouble. We went to the restaurant on our first evening and I highly recommend it! The food was exceptionally good and our waitor even better with extensive knowledge of the Catalan cuisine and its accompanying wines, I was particularly impressed with the wealth of languages he spoke! The hotel itself was beautiful with a perfect combination of luxury and modern sleekness. The rooftop was great with an array of drinks at the bar and fabulous views over the harbour and behind to the gothic quarter-the Serras could not be in a better location. Can't wait until my next visit!",5,2015,08,27
18,Highly Recommend,"We stayed for 7 wonderful nights at this hotel. It exceeded our expectations - luxurious rooms and great location on the harbor and near many shops restaurants and sights. The best part of the hotel was the staff, always cheerful and extremely helpful especially Carolina Rebecca Daniel Jann and Sergio.  We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Barcelona. I highly recommend the Serras. ",5,2015,08,26
18,"Amazing, relaxing stay at a true 5 star hotel :-)","Wow - what can I say about the Serras! I stayed here for 3 nights in July with my husband and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we felt so well looked after by everyone at the Serras! From the glass of fizz we were given at reception on check in to the fab restaurant recommendations they provided, nothing was too much trouble. When we got into our room there was a handwritten note welcoming us to the Serras, which was a lovely touch! This is a modern, new hotel which is styled beautifully, right in the centre of Barcelona. The breakfasts were to die for, the pool area was beautiful, and the lunch menu on offer up there was also just right. We ate out every night so can't comment on the evening meals, but from the look of the menu I would wager they were also delicious!

Can't wait to come back to this beautiful place, and we've raved about it so much my mother in law has already booked for September! 

If you're thinking about a trip to Barcelona and love fresh, stylish hotels and friendly, unstuffy but flawless 5 star service, look no further than the Serras!",5,2015,08,25
18,Simply the best hotel we ever stayed in..,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my wife for our 10th anniversary and it was a great choice. We had the Junior Suite with Sea View which was simply breath-taking. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and you feel welcomed from the very first minute.  Carolina and her team helped me a lot organising the week-end  and everything was just perfect.

The bar on the roof top is a very nice place to relax. The swimming pool is rather small but big enough for a fresh relief. The breakfast is worth every penny (you should try the freshly made avocado sandwich).

Simply 10 out of 10. We highly recommend this place to everyone who wants to experience a truly unforgettable visit to Barcelona.",5,2015,08,24
18,Fantastic,"We have stayed at the mandarin , the mercer , and hotel Neri this hotel would be our choice next time to stay again!!, Beds are heavenly excellent linen  the staff are fantastic , the chef who does have a michelin star has a wonderful menu and relaxed style simple healthy but a step above the norm... do dine here we spent more for a larger room , good decision! There is a pool but its not large still a fun rooftop",5,2015,08,15
18,very cool hotel in an awesome location with great staff!,"This hotel is a gem. Great location and very chic décor. Loved the staff. They accommodated every need. They even joined and redecorate two junior suites and made a master suite, in two hours notice!!

I travel a lot and have stayed in hundreds if not thousands of hotels.
This is one of the best!",5,2015,08,13
18,Outstanding hotel in a great area,"We were completely blown away by this great hotel. The building itself is beautiful, the rooms very well appointed and modern (but still with character). The food was fantastic, particularly the breakfast (best orange juice I have ever had!). The rooftop terrace with plunge pool, small bar and views across the Marina was really welcome with the warm weather. However the thing that really sets the hotel apart from others in the same grading is the staff. Every single member of staff was a pleasure to meet each day, from the concierge to the reception hosts and a gentleman that I assumed to be the manager. Genuinely exceptional, especially for a hotel that has only been open for a few months. Would recommend without hesitation and will definitely use again when we next visit Barcelona.",5,2015,08,07
18,What an exceptional jewel to find in Barcelona !!!,"My wife booked this gem of a hotel on the internet for our trip to Spain and we were thoroughly impressed by the caliber of the property and especially the staff.  From the moment we arrived and were checked in by a delightful young lady and her associate ( Silvina & Carolina), through the efforts of Joaquim (the bellman/jack-of-all-requests) and Rebeca in the morning, we were treated like honored friends rather than hotel guests.  Every time we had any queries, they were immediately responded to.
The property itself is wonderful, tastefully decorated & beautifully designed in the heart of the marina district ... a wonderful location!   The view from rooftop lounge and pool area was great. 
I can't recommend them enough for making our stay a memorable experience.",5,2015,08,04
18,Lovely place to stay,"Small but excellent room, perfect bed, nice bathroom.  Extremely helpful staff.  A permanent smile on every face.  Very convenient location. We loved our stay and would dream to find a hotel like that in every city.  The only drawback is the absence of a real swimming pool.",5,2015,08,03
18,Not the ordinary hotel ,"I had the pleasure of spending one night  in the serras on the occasion of one of My usual business trips to Bcn.
The Serras stands out for personality and uniqueness , expressed in the attention to the smallest details and in the great  Service provided by the young but experienced  team.
The room was large, comfortable; contemporary design with echoes of  traditional elements making it different from your everyday luxury hotel room.
A special thanks to the GM who made everything possible to make me feel at home despite the short stay over.
",5,2015,08,02
18,Just amazing!,"This hotel is quite new and just wonderful - the lovely staff, the roof terrace with its pool, the modern rooms, the bar. It feels like a little island in the middle of busy Barcelona. Can highly recommend it!",5,2015,08,02
18,Wonderful hotel,"A beautifully designed hotel with outstanding customer care - my husband and I took our teenage daughter for 3 nights - a junior suite with a put-up bed for her; my only reservation was that space was a bit of a premium and, although she was hidden by the fantastic tv unit at the foot of our bed there was very little privacy - fine for us but worth noting.  Extremely comfortable bed (including put-up!), gorgeous bathroom with lots of toiletries.  Breakfast was delicious and very plentiful.  Very well positioned for all our excursions - for which the hotel gave us many helpful recommendations.  Lovely view from window but if you want to see the marina/sea you need to be on the top floor.  The rooftop pool was glorious and the cocktails delicious.  This is a wonderful hotel and we loved it.  Highly recommended.",5,2015,07,28
18,First class,"Again, this is a 'proper' 5 star hotel. Many hotels call themselves 5 star these days but are lacking in the extra touches that raise the level of an establishment from the expected to the superb. It is never just one thing but the collective experience that deserves the highest rating. The front desk staff are lovely. Rebecca helped from start to finish with all that was needed and more. I asked for a later check out as my husband was unwell and she phoned the next guest to see when they would arrive and then did not charge us when she found they would not be in until later. While it was not a long time past checkout that we needed the room, so many hotels are rigid with their rules when bending a bit can create much more customer loyalty. I will return because of the staff! The roof deck is a very nice touch and while small, there are generally few people, a great view and tasty food. We had a small suite, excellent bed, nespresso, beautiful bathroom, and again, nice little touches eg the TV rotates to face the living area or bed and turn down service with special goodies each night. Although a busy area the windows are quite soundproof so it is worth being in such a great location. There is no reason not to stay here if it is in your budget. If not try it anyway and please tell Rebecca she is lovely and should never change!",5,2015,07,26
18,The Best Hotel Experience- A Complete Standout in Quality,"You know this hotel is special before you even arrive as they contact you prior regarding any special needs and requests.  I had done my homework so knew The Serras would not be a mistake but it exceeded all expectations.  From the moment we entered (and greeted with a Cava), we loved it.  The location is perfect... close to all the action (Las Ramblas) yet distant enough to be free of the congestion... with sea views and atmosphere.  We walked everywhere (even the beach was right there but we didn't have time for sunbathing).   The hotel is new, fresh, modern and comfortable with space in our grand deluxe for a rollaway.  The rooftop bar was a bonus with high quality cocktails and beautiful view.  It's a small hotel and they go the extra mile to make it feel personal.  The staff continually seek to please and we made full use of Carolina's kind services with dinner suggestions/reservations, train tickets, communications to our next hotel in Madrid and more.  The attention to detail is amazing and I already miss the homemade goodies every afternoon (rather than the stereotypical chain hotel chocolate on your pillow).  There were no negative surprises at checkout; only smiles and sincere good wishes.  We'd go back to The Serras in a heartbeat.",5,2015,07,24
18,Great 5 Star Experience,The staff greeted us by name from the moment we stepped foot in this hotel.  Nice arrival reception.  The hotel tried their best to get us situated after almost 16 hours of flying.  Love the breakfast buffet and the morning staff.  Yulia was very attentive to us every morning.  Great central locations for exploring everything in Barcelona.  Cool modern rooms.  5 star experience.,5,2015,07,22
18,CLASS ACT!,"It is very hard to put into words our experience at Hotel The Serras, but I hope I do it justice. Our exceptional experience started from the very minute we booked our room about a month prior to our travel to Barcelona. We contacted the hotel to plan some restaurants that we wanted to dine at. The concierge immediately went work in trying to secure these impossible reservations. They were able to secure one, but our first choice was getting difficult, however the fact that El Celler de Can Roca was booked straight for over 1 year did not deter them. When we arrived they surprised us with a confirmed reservation! The staff there had an amazing personal touch to all our requests and needs. Wonderful suggests to for touring, shopping and other dining reservations. Our kids had a blast, they were so helpful and attentive to our kids. They would go up to the rooftop pool and cafe by themselves and staff was so cool hanging out with them. All the staff truly went out of their way for us, from the always helpful doorman to the reception, even the hotel manager and the owner personally came and greeted us. The manager every morning will stop by our breakfast table to ask how things are and if we need anything. Not many places will provide such amazing level of service. We have traveled a lot and stayed at some of the most fabulous hotels, we place this way up top! And yes we plan on going back to Barcelona and we will stay there. Location is perfect!",5,2015,07,22
18,The only place to stay in Barcelona. Perfect!,"My wife and I went for our 16th anniversary to Paris and Barcelona. We are both professionals in the Washington DC area and as such, accustomed to nice restaurants and hotels. In other words, you have a high bar to cross if you are to impress us.

I originally found this hotel online and began to research this and the other hotels in the area. After deciding on this one based on the location's proximity to the marina and central location to everything else, we booked 4 nights and I contacted the hotel to see if it would be possible to ensure that we had a room facing the marina. While they couldn't guarantee it, they certainly seemed earnest in making an attempt to accommodate us.

So we fly to Barcelona from Paris without any issue. We walk through the Barcelona airport to see two customs signs. Something to declare? Go to the left. Nothing to declare? Go to the right. We go to the right, and walk right out without even getting our passports stamped. Seemed kind of odd that they don't know who is entering the country, but OK.

We get to The Serras and get out of the cab. Before we can even get the handles pulled up on the suitcases, Sergio is there insisting on taking care of anything and everything. I swear I thought for a second he was even going to pay the cab driver. LOL

We walk to the front door and we have another person opening the door and greeting us. Rebecca walks with us to the reception desk and begins to have a very nice conversation about our trip, where we are from, and is zeroing in on who we are so she can get us checked in. Sergio is standing behind us with our luggage ready to get anything we want. The next thing I know we each have a beautiful glass of Cava in out hand. 

Rebecca gets us checked in and mentions they have been holding a great room for us. (Oh sure, what hotel doesn't tell you that before they give you a view of the alley in the back?) But Sergio takes us to the best room in the hotel from what I can gather. On the corner, top floor, facing the marina, and it's big. I had asked for a king size bed and it was actually king sized! (unlike king in Paris, which is basically an American queen sized as it turns out)

Sergio leaves and we are already excited that we booked this hotel based on our first impressions. Then we notice a bowl of fruit and a bottle of Cava in a huge ice bucket with two glasses, with a note from the manager thanking us for choosing their hotel and congratulating us on our anniversary. Very nice! Loving everything about The Serras, and it gets better. We get unpacked and head downstairs to figure out what we will do next.

We get to the bottom of the elevator. Start walking to the front door and Rebecca and Sergio are both running towards us to make sure everything is in perfect order. And it is. I reach for the front door to leave the lobby, and THIS is where I learned an important rule at The Serras. Guests of the hotel are not to touch the door. They have people to do that, and they enjoy greeting you and making sure you are set with anything you need. Amazing frankly. Very professional and personable at the same time. An excellent practice for a boutique hotel!

After walking around a bit we came back to the hotel and I reached out to open the door for my wife. And as if by magic Sergio appears, making sure he beat me to the handle. Inquiring about our walk. Making sure we were comfortable with the area. And here comes Rebecca again asking what she could do for us. This is a FIVE STAR operation folks. Make no mistake about it.

Showers have great pressure. Bathrooms are designed with a modern look. Safe in the room. Sofa and chair in our room, along with that king sized bed. Speaking of the bed, Rebecca had joked with us when we checked in about the quality of their beds and told us that a guest had bought a mattress set and had it delivered to his home after staying there. Having slept on this bed, I will say that if there is a more comfortable bed anywhere I the world, I would like to see it! This is simply the best, like everything else at The Serras.

They have a loft styled area that is a combination of library and bar on the second floor that looks out over the lobby and the main restaurant. We never saw anyone there, although it gave me a very relaxing place to sit while my wife was enjoying her message which had been arranged by the hotel.

During the day, the roof offers a small very stylish pool and incredible views of Barcelona and the marina. There are plenty of lounge chairs to take in a bit of sun, and servers that can bring any type to drink and have a food menu available. It never got crowded and the temperature could not have been better.

During the evening and into the night, the roof turns into a crowd of well dressed patrons enjoying dinner and/or drinks at tables that weren't there during the day. They had a DJ playing electronica house trance types of music. Not too loud. Not too soft. Just right, like everything else here. The bar is fully stocked, and if they don't have it someone will disappear and show up with it moments later. The pool is lit with blue lights and there is a cool looking tree in the middle of the roof. The whole thing is well thought out and well executed.

We were at The Serras for 4 nights. Every time we came into the building or left the building we had people making sure we were set with our directions, plans, or ideas. We even had occasion to have one of the other reception people give us a list of tapas restaurants in the area were we were headed one evening, just in case ours was too busy. To heck with our choice, we went with her recommendation. Tapeo. And as you might expect, it exceeded our expectations!

We did eat at the very nice Informal Restaurant one evening and had a wonderful meal. They have 1 Michelin Star which was well deserved. We had the Festival of St Juan (explained below) dinner special, so there is little reason to go into it, as that part of the menu changes nightly. But it was great!

St Juan is the second biggest holiday in Barcelona. We didn't know about it when we booked the trip but it basically goes for 24 hours and is nonstop firecrackers and small fireworks. Completely unorganized. But it is EVERYWHERE you go. Not confined to a particular area, it's in every neighborhood and street in Barcelona. The next day (Wednesday in this instance), the entire city shuts down for the holiday. Yes there's drinking also, but there are little kids everywhere so the drinking was not really the main even as it might be in the US. It was VERY loud. These are the big boys of the firecracker world, and every 6 year old kid we saw was lighting them as fast as they could. Crazy. Dangerous. But it's their festival, and they've been doing this for hundreds of years, so who are we to judge. I will say it was so loud walking around that it really does hurt your ears.

In the end, we went to Barcelona expecting a good hotel with decent surroundings and typical staffing. What we got was absolutely exceptional. We've told everyone we know about this place. And for those who have ever seen my reviews of other hotels or restaurants, you know I am a tough reviewer. I'm not a fanboy and will tell it like it is. Having said that, this is the standout hotel of our travels over the past few years. We really didn't find anything that wasn't well thought our and executed to perfection.

My congratulations to the owners and staff of The Serras. You set the standard for what travel and hospitality should be worldwide! Thank you.",5,2015,07,22
18,Most Amazing Hotel Ever!!  Love this place,"The Serras was exceptional in every way.  Customer service was impeccable, from the dinner recommendations and reservations before we arrived, to graciously waiving charge for one night when airline delay caused us to miss it, to the tour and greeting we received on arrival.  Everyone, from the doorman to the concierge was so helpful and gracious.  The rooms are modern, light bright and have incredible attention to detail.  Loved the mirrors over the sinks which had a slight magnification.  Beds are super comfy and linens and towels high quality.  The rooftop pool/ bar area was stunning, offering incredible views and a lovely place to have a cocktail after a day of sightseeing.  They had a small band/cocktail party there on one night to which all the guests were invited.  The location was perfect, near the most up-coming happening area of El Born, but also close to Gothic area, beach area and Las Ramblas (all walking distance).  I can't say enough about this hotel.  We stayed in 5 star hotels in Pamplona and Ibiza on the same trip after The Serras, but they all paled in comparison.  Great value for the price as well. We only ate breakfast there, but it was fabulous and if you are a big breakfast person you may want to have breakfast included in your stay.",5,2015,07,21
18,Fantastic and stylish visit - highly recommended,"Having lived in Barcelona as recently as January, I was looking for a stylish boutique hotel that would act as a home away from home for my return visit and would allow me to be close enough to the Eixample (where I used to live) but also close to the Beach and Harbour areas. The Serras really fit the bill - and in a most stylish, personalised and friendly manner, really exceeding my already high expectations.

From the moment of check-in, I was welcomed with a lovely glass of really very nice cava, and then whisked upstairs to check out the roof top where a Sunday night drinks and DJ party was underway and then for a tour of the hotels lounge and restaurant before arriving to my room. The room was a good size, with an oversized bathroom, all white and bright and clean. I particularly enjoyed being able to step out onto the small balcony and enjoy a glass of wine, whilst looking out over the roofs of the barrio gotic and harbour. The decor of the room was super stylish with a very large comfortable bed. The small couch at the end of the bed was useful particularly when friends stopped by for a visit.

The roof top was a great spot to enjoy the view, a sun bake and a swim - and the drinks, food and service up there were excellent - there was even some complimentary refreshing drinks served in small shot glasses at intervals throughout the day - a nice touch.

The ‘Informal Restaurant’ was a real highlight of my visit - I enjoyed one breakfast, 2 lunches and 2 dinners throughout my 5 day stay - and the quality, value for money and service were all outstanding.

In summary, I would highly recommend The Serras. It was a perfect visit, and I really struggle to identify any weak areas. I look forward to returning in the future.",5,2015,07,21
18,"First Class experience, THE PERFECT PLACE TO STAY in Barcelona","From the moment we walked through the door we felt welcomed appreciated and totally cared for.  The rooms were sparkling clean with crisp white sheets, the same mattresses used in Buckingham palace and a spacious fresh new modern bathroom ""suite"".  Family of three extremely comfortable,safe and at home. 

Carolina called us days before arrival prior to our visit to take care of any special requests.  The GM Antonio met us at the door and made us feel like we were all friends and we were returning. Silvina was a top notch concierge taking care of every restaurant and attraction bookings.  Recommendations were right on the money! Concierge is 24/7. They answer phone and emails. 

We were sad to leave these wonderful people and will look forward to seeing them again. Choose The Serras - you will be glad you did!",5,2015,07,21
18,Outstanding Hospitality @ Hotel The Serras,"My family and I were recently in Barcelona for a short break, we had a reservation for 5 nights in the Cotton House which is also a very nice property, however when we went to the Serras for Dinner and met Antonio, the GM who quickly organised a tour of the facilities, we were very impressed by the friendliness & hospitality of the team. Antonio kindly checked room availability and we jumped at the chance to switch hotels later in our stay because of the location & beautiful design. We were thrilled to be given both an upgrade and an additional adjoining room for our kids due to a last minute cancellation, we enjoyed lazy lunches & chilling out on the roof. In conclusion a great new addition to the Barcelona Hotel scene with fantastic hospitality from Antonio & his team, When can we come back????",5,2015,07,20
18,Perfection,"We realized something was different from the reservation moment, the lady emailing us was always so sweet and attentive. When we arrived they were waiting for us and came outside to warm welcome us. We didn't have breakfast included, but had breakfast in the restaurant every single day. Was such great, high quality local product, nothing was missing and the entire team serving the breakfast also very attentive and polite at any moment. all the eggs are done at the moment and its all inclusive at a very reasonable price. can not mention the terrace upstairs. we were ending up our day with a refreshing cocktail upstairs looking at the sea. very nice, calm and relax.",5,2015,07,17
18,Very good but not perfect,I agree with reviewers on the high level of personal service and room quality.  Restaurant while good at night is not particularly good at breakfast and buffet selection and service lacking.  Should be aware gym is very small and parking off site and a 10 minute wait. The rooftop plunge pool area is limited to cater for about 6 lounges and was packed up at 7pm on a Sunday night and a big party scene unfolded with lots of people and drinkers everywhere up and down through the hotel.,4,2015,07,16
18,Perfect mix of features you expect for a luxury stay,"Just returned from a 5 night stay (July) at the The Serras. This was my second time in Barcelona; first time was 7 years ago.  The hotel seems to have found the perfect mix of luxury, service and location. The hotel is a small boutique property with only 28 rooms and located between the harbor/ocean and the Gothic and El Born historic areas. For tourists this is ideal as you have the options to shop, eat and browse within the amazing historic alleys of Barri Gotic and El Born or you can take a run or head to the harbor all within a few steps. The hotel is just the right size and has spared no expense in its rooms with sleek, large stall showers with top of the line Hansgrohe shower heads and faucets to beds that are fit for a king/queen. . . literally. Upon check in and a tour of our room we were told that there was an extensive process used to choose beds and they are the same beds used by the Royal Family in England.  After a night's sleep I can honestly say it was one of the best beds I've ever slept in.  The entire design of the hotel is very modern, sleek and just beautiful.  One of the best features of the hotels was the rooftop with a bar, pool and several lounge chairs.  This made for a nice touch after a long day touring the city, grabbing a quick bite for lunch and enjoying a late evening drink. By far the most impressive aspect of the Serras was the level of service.  We always felt like the staff went out of the way to answer our questions, ask us how our day was, recommend restaurants, etc.  It was always done with a smile and was genuine.  You get the feeling  the folks who work here love their jobs. From Rebeca who helped us organized dinner reservations and transportation prior to our arrival, to Sergio who took our luggage and served us a drink while checking in, there was always a friendly face ready to lend a hand.  After a couple nights here you truly feel as if the entire staff has made an effort to get to know you and goes out of their way to make sure you're enjoying yourself.  Can't remember a hotel where I felt the service was that genuine and the people working there were as passionate as the folks I met here.  Ona, the Deputy Manager was always around and introduced herself during one of our breakfasts and was fantastic.  Sergio and Daniel always had a smile on their face and made sure we had everything we needed.  And Carolina was equally as impressive helping us with dinner reservations.  Hard to fault much about this property. Perhaps a bit more light in the shower?. . . but that's even a stretch.",5,2015,07,14
18,I'm still Dreaming the Essence of Barcelona,"My husband has already written a review about The Serras but I wanted to write one from my perspective too. I work in hospitality and am very much involved in the training of new team. I was so impressed with the guest service here, Antonio and Ona were exemplary and the rest of the team followed their lead faultlessly. I cannot single out anyone as it would be unfair when they were all so friendly, helpful and genuine. I know they are all very proud of what they are achieving and so they should be.
The hotel itself is beautiful, great design, spacious and yet we felt so at home. The location is spot on for wandering through the narrow streets of the gothic quarter and the views out to sea are lovely.
The food in Informal is great, the pool area is a great place to chill and we both had massages which were excellent. The only place I didn't manage to test was the gym, despite my good intentions ;)
From start to finish we had the best experience and I can't wait to get back to my home in Barcelona.",5,2015,07,10
18,Beautiful hotel ,This could potentially be one of the best hotels in Barcelona. The service was impeccable and the food in the restaurant was spectacular. The hotel in general is beautiful and they have a lovely little rooftop terrace with a great view over the port. Definitely opt for this hotel over any other in the city. ,5,2015,07,08
18,This is the TOP,"We have been visiting Barcelona many times and always staying in different hotel, this time we have found our hotel forever. The ladies at reception and the ladies at breakfast are all so sweat and nice, the quality of the breakfast it's the best ever tried",5,2015,07,08
18,First trip to Barcelona,"Could not have asked for a more enjoyable stay! 

The hotel is open less than a year. It is beautifully appointed with a Spanish modern flair. The room are spacious based on European standards. The location is perfect... Across from the Marina and close to Las Ramblas. 

The true standout though is the staff. They went out of their way to make us feel at home! We were greeted with champagne when we arrived. They were attentive without being intrusive during our entire stay. 
 
If and when I visit Barcelona again, this is where I will stay. 

",5,2015,07,06
18,Wow!,"This hotel is amazing – the staff, the location, the rooms, the service. Upon checking in, I was warmly welcomed by Silvania and the gentleman on the door (unfortunately, I don’t know his name) who during my stay, were both so friendly, welcoming and remembered my name! I was given a glass of Cava at check in, and shown around the hotel. Every time I entered or left the hotel I was greeted by all the staff. This hotel simply has to be experienced. The attention to detail added to the enjoyment of staying here – including the welcoming note in the room, the bowl of fruit and the desserts as part of the turn down service. From the moment I entered this hotel I was made to feel welcome and comfortable; if I had needed anything, the staff were more than willing to assist. Staying in a hotel like this made such a difference to my enjoyment and experience of Barcelona. 
I stayed in a Deluxe Room, which was very comfortable and had a small balcony. The bed was big and comfy, the shower was brilliant, and the whole room was well appointed. I could hear no noise from the street below. 
The hotel has lots of facilities – restaurant, gym, bar. I recommend having a drink at the bar on the roof top – it’s lovely to unwind there after a day of sightseeing. The hotel is located at the edge of the Gothic Quarter,  so it’s in walking distance to a lot of attractions – Las Ramblas, Picasso Museum, Santa Maria del Mar, El Born district, to name a few. It’s also within walking distance of one of the metro lines. 
This was my first trip to Barcelona, and I am so glad that I stayed here. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,07,05
18,Great stay in Barcelona!,"We stayed at The Serras during our very first trip to Barcelona recently and all I can say is that we could not have picked a better hotel. The property is nice and rooms are spacious and nicely decorated, the roof top bar seemed very nice though we did not use it. The location of hotel is absolutely perfect - very close to the old city Barri Gotic and the port. The Metro station Drassanes is 5 minute walk and we used it for most of our site seeing in Barcelona.
The best part of the hotel for us was its friendly staff who were always smiling and ready to help with anything we needed from restaurant recommendation to making reservations for attractions. I would like to thank Cassi for all her help and excellent recommendations that made our stay in Barcelona a truly memorable one.
The only little downside is that the hotel does not include breakfast in room rates and the breakfast in restaurant is quite expensive. But it was not an issue as there are two excellent bakeries right behind the hotel where we truly enjoyed our breakfast of croissants, breads and coffee. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona!",5,2015,07,02
18,Mixing business and pleasure,"I am not a big fan of tripadvisor but I had to write about this hotel. I went for business meetings to Barcelona and a friend recommended me The Serras Hotel. It was the best recommendation ever. Easy to go to all my meetings (taxis drop you in front of the hotel and has great connection with the business area) but also good for relaxing in the evening and enjoying some cocktails ""like a local"" in the rooftop. Their restaurant is a must. Nice, helpful and very professional staff. What else can you ask for?",5,2015,07,02
18,"Perfect service, great design and ideal location to explore Barcelona","We stayed in The Serras for 5 days on our first trip to Barcelona and we would certainly return on a next trip. Everyone (staff and management) is extremely nice and offering help with whatever you might need. It is a very international team and two of them even speak Dutch (actually one Spanish guy and one girl from Australia), so I guess they have quite a lot of languages covered. The personal service is really their trademark and I hope they can keep up this level when it's no longer a ""new"" hotel.

We booked a standard room and the size was more than enough for us. The design was very luxurious and clean. They come every evening with a small treat from the restaurant and will clean your room a second time if you want. 

Food was very good. We always had breakfast outside and you have plenty of choice. They bring fresh fruit, juice, coffee or tea, eggs or pancakes (made to order) and some croissants to your table and you get the other things (more juice, cheese, bread, .... from the buffet (the only disadvantage is that this is inside and the doors are quite heavy, but we used the automatic one on the side if there was no one to open it). You can of course also eat inside to avoid this small disadvantage. We had dinner once at the restaurant and really liked it.

The hotel is centrally located and we walked (almost) everywhere. You can get to the historic centre in a few minutes, but also to Barcelonetta for a diner in the evening. 

The only 'negative' point of our stay was a lot of noise at night from the rooftop terrace. We had a room on the fifth floor (just below the bar) and a lot of noise came through. However, they solved this very professionally and when we mentioned it to the person at the door, he didn't say ""I will transfer the message."" but immediately spoke to the manager who came to us to discuss this further. As it was our last night, we didn't want to be bothered to change rooms, but they gave earplugs, we got a free bottle of cava and they also reduced our bill with some of the drinks we had in the bar. Most importantly, that night, they stopped the music of a private event at midnight and didn't continue to play music afterwards. I slept perfect that night. For this level of service, they still deserve the 100% rating.",5,2015,07,02
18,Dedicated staff !,"We stayed for 4 nights in this brand new hotel. It is ideal located from walking distance to Ramblas, port and beach. It is difficult to express how dedicated the staff was. To be honest i have never been to a hotel before which such a friendly and warm staff. The rooms are crisp clean and just perfect. We only experienced 1 negative aspect. The rooftop swimming pool  was during our stay 3 times closed from 16.30h for a private event. After a long walk in the city we were not able to take a refreshing swim. A bit strange that the hotel guests were not informed... I think with Mr. Bignone's dedication to keep have a high service level in every detail he should reconsider having private events which affect other guest.",4,2015,07,01
18,"Best Hotel, Best Service!","We were surprised to see that many good reviews on tripadvisor and we had very high expectations. 
From the moment Quim opened the door of our cab we knew we were in good hands. Then the ladies at the reception were lovely, helpful with restaurant recommendations and recommended to book the tickets for the main attractions with them. They did all the work we just had to enjoy.
Breakfast the following morning was yumee! It is a bit expensive but it is worth trying.
PS: do not forget to get a cocktail in the rooftop, Albert the Bar Manager is the best!",5,2015,07,01
18,The one and only,"What an outstanding and amazing stay we had in Barcelona. And this thanks to the GM Antonio Bignone, his team and the absolutely remarkable hotel.  I want to express my heartfelt thanks. The whole team was so attentive, happy, friendly, discreet and professional which made us feel very special. 
 
The food in both restaurants the rooftop and informal (which is a 1 Star Michelin) was sublime with service to match!
 
I have the great fortune to get around the world a lot and stay in many different very good hotels. The Serras is one of my top 3! If not even number 1. I will definitely be back this year.

Keep it up!",5,2015,07,01
18,amazing terrace and great sangria,"I arrived to this super amazing terrace by coincidence. The personnel was very nice, sangria extremely good, view if the harbour amazing! I would suggest a visit here in the late afternoon to enjoy a quete view of the seaside and the city",5,2015,06,25
18,Excellent Boutique Hotel,"My 5th Barcelona visit and Hotel The Serra's is my favorite. We stayed with my family for 3 nights. The hotel's super clean and new. Service was excellent.  We felt welcomed and at home the moment we walked in. 
What I loved about the hotel was the location. It was close to most of the attraction. The alleys of Passeig de Colom would lead you to lots of surprises like great restaurants and shopping.The bar lounge has a fabulous view of the city. 
Our standard room was pretty small though and it can get a little noisy at night. But this didn't dampen our spirits. By far,one of the best hotels I have stayed in Europe.",5,2015,06,24
18,Such a cool hotel!! Loved it!!,"From the moment we arrived we knew were in for a treat!! The facilities, the surrounding, the room and most importantly, the service were outstanding!!! The GM is a superstar! He really took care of us, he honestly made a difference, he added a very personal touch to our stay!!!  Thank you The Serras, you spoilt us!!!",5,2015,06,23
18,Fantastic,"We spent 4 nights in THE SERRAS. ...Fantastic. A great welcome, very, very, nice and clean rooms. The Location was excellent. The SERRAS is well situted.  Special thank you Caroline, Rebeca, Silvina  ( Guest Relation), thank you Ruben,( Barman)., thank you Daniela and Puim, from the guest Service. They all and the team have made our stay very pleasant. The Serras is not a big Hotel but during our stay everything was perfect. My wife and i do a lot of traveling all around the world, the Serras was one of the best places we did stay. Please, please, continue this work for the future...  We hope so and we will come back...",5,2015,06,20
18,Service is second to none!,"The BEST hotel we've stayed in across all of Europe. Not only is the location amazing, their service is impeccable. From the moment we arrived all the staff came to greet us, there was nothing they weren't prepared to do to help and make our experience a memorable one (special mention of Rebeca who was both professional and delightful to deal with.The rooms are amazing and the Bar upstairs was buzzing on a Friday night and had a great vibe, as did Bar Nine on the 1st floor. The Serras is simply a 10/10 choice for location, service and room quality.",5,2015,06,15
18,New jewell in wonderfull location,"small, new, pretty, comfortable, Picasso used to lived here.close the the marina las ramblas, la cathedral, el barrio gotico and transportation. The staff is excellent biligual at least and very accomodating the manager was very involve and available. Internet work very well, wonderfull breakfast and the personal very helpfull.",5,2015,06,13
18,"Great Service, Food, and Style","We stayed at The Serras for a couple of days in May to explore Barcelona prior to a cruise.  The hotel is nicely situated for accessing tours, for walks on Las Ramblas, Barri Gothic, and along the waterfront for good restaurants for paella and tapas.  We did take a taxi to the docks as the dock area was more industrial, rather than walk as we had in other cities.  

The hotel was wonderful. The room was a nice size, very clean, fresh, and the bed comfortable. The friendly and efficient staff went above and beyond.  Rebeca, at the front desk, detailed maps for every place we wanted to see and made great suggestions for other destinations.  The food at The Serras is wonderful.  We had two very nice breakfasts and a delightful dinner at the hotel.  The dining room and rooftop bar are tastefully modern in decor.  

We highly recommend staying at The Serras if you like boutique hotels with great food in a centralized location.",5,2015,06,11
18,Top location Top quality Top service,"For me one of the best hotels in Barcelona. Located in El Gotic, close to Barcelonetta, Rambla and other important places. From our room on 5th floor we had amazing view on port and sea. Nice big rooms, well equipped. Large bathroom. Excellent, professional and very helpful staff. Large breakfast with long list of hot dishes and special sandwiches like organic sandwich with avocado.",5,2015,06,11
18,amazing experience,"Absolutely amazing experience with the most fantastic staff. every single member of the team, fron front of house to bars to pool terrace were friendly, with everyone smiling, happy in their work and made the whole experience like being at home. No request was considered an inconvenience and they put themselves out to accommodate every request. Simply cannot fault the hotel staff in any way. A pleasure to saty there and we will ceratainly be returning in 2016
cannot recommend highly enough.
Book it now but make sure you leave room for our return!

18,Highly Recommended,"Awesome boutique hotel in perfect location, especially if you want to explore the Barri Gotic area. Recently completely renovated/constructed within old building. Very tasteful decor and design, with spacious rooms (and great quality toiletries!)

The dining experience at 'Informal' is excellent. 

The most outstanding feature of this hotel is the quality of the staff who are all delightful and clearly love their job. In particular we have to make special mention of both Rebecca (front reception) and Daniel (concierge). By the end of our stay they were more like friends.

We read how this hotel was the long-term dream of it's owner who wanted to create a hotel based on everything he would want as a guest. The result is a credit to him.

This was our first time experiencing a small 'boutique'-style hotel and we are converted for life.",5,2015,06,07
18,Fabulous hotel,"Recently stated at this hotel with my family for my Dad's birthday and had a wonderful stay. The staff were very welcoming and friendly and could not do enough to help. Breakfast was five star with choices of smoothies, juices, breads, ham, cheese, breads, pastries, smoked salmon and a choice of hot breakfast. Rooms fantastic, roof terrace beautiful.. Could not fault the staff or service, will definitely be returning! Thank you for making my Dads birthday break a fantastic experience and stay will never forget. ",5,2015,06,06
18,Amazing find,"Superbly located with some rooms having sea view. Elegant small lobby. Roof top bar with  snacks, tremendous dining experience and café between the street and front door wonderful for breakfast.. All F&B outlets are as good as you'll find anywhere. Rooms are good size with all the accouterments of a 5 star hotel, bathrooms the same. The final icing on the cake is the two adorable and ultra efficient desk/concierge staff..Rebeca from Romania and Carolina from Uruguay..they could not be more helpfuland charming..Rebeca is only 21, in a few years she will be a GM. The GM is Italian but didnt see or meet him. This should be your stay when in Barcelona.",5,2015,06,02
18,Excellent hotel in Barcelona,"Would highly recommend the Hotel Serras in Barcelona, centrally located for The Ramblas, the gothic quarter, and the beaches. you are made to feel welcome from the moment you arrive with a professional but unfussy check in, tour of the hotel facilities and prompt delivery of your bags. The staff are friendly, efficient,  fun and very helpful. 
Loved the terrace, great views, drinks and nice plunge pool, which is very welcome after a day sight seeing in the sun. Ok your not going to get any laps in but that's not the point.

The two bars are very good and well stocked, had one meal on the terrace which was lovely,

Our room was on the side (not facing the marina) at first was a little disappointed as all the rooms have a balcony and was thinking it would be nice sitting out of an evening having a drink, however the road outside is very busy (with the doors closed you don't hear a thing, so sleeping isn't an issue at all) but to be honest we weren't in the room much.

The room is good, a decent size and the shower was very good, if I had any complaint and its only a couple of minor things:

bathroom does need a towel rail for the bath towels, had to hang on the shower door handle and door handle 

The hooks for the robes had bent almost out of the wall, clearly not strong enough to hold the weight of the robes

TV - appreciate its Spain but only 2 channels in English both news, and as much as I like the news would be nice to have some movies in English. That said your out most of the day and evening 

We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, instead opting to visit local bakeries there is a lovely place 2 mins from the hotel, come out the side exit up the lane and its opposite 

Highly recommend going to TIbadabo park, catch he metro then the blue tram and finally funicular to the top, sadly the old tram was closed the day we went for filming !!! 
Also worth noting that the funicular does not start until after 11am and if you can sit in the front seats in the first car for the best views",5,2015,06,02
18,AMAZING!!!!!,"Wow this hotel is top notch! It is brand new, super clean, comfortable, and has a very friendly staff!! From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with champagne and water while we checked in! We were given a tour of the hotel as well as taken to our room! Honestly, out of all the hotels we have stayed in, we have never felt so welcome before! The roof top bar and pool have an amazing view of the waterfront in Barcelona! We spend our first day there! In the evenings, they turn down your bed and leave you with a bottled water and a treat on your nightstand. It was in a perfect location. Quick walk to the born district. The gothic district was directly behind the hotel, and the beach was a quick walk in front of the hotel! Would highly recommend this hotel!",5,2015,06,02
18,Perfect!,"The Serras is a wonderful find!  My room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the sea!  I felt like I had an apartment in Batcelona.

18,wonderful staff,"My husband and I enjoyed staying this hotel.
One negative things is a bit slow service at the reataurant, but food is good.

Wonderful staff, thanks to Carolina, Silvina and all other staff. All of them were friendly and great help to our stay.

18,Great Boutique Hotel in Barcelona,"This hotel recommended by a friend of mine.  It is a great place.  From friendly staff, bar to restaurant with great food.

Great location and wonderful staff who gave advice, directions, etc. Our thanks to Carolina, Daniel, and Rebecca! We loved the spacious room (asked for a quiet room and got one), beautiful, well-designed bathroom (just press a button to start the shower!), complimentary fruit assortment in our room, turn down treats each night, etc. Had a great dinner and breakfast in their dining room (The Informal). The hotel location is great! On the waterfront and within walking distance of the main sights in the Gothic quarter and near El Born. We look forward to a return stay!",5,2015,06,01
18,Wonderful Time at The Serras,"This hotel is one of the best hotels my wife, friend and myself have ever stayed. The staff was just absolutely wonderful, making you feel like friends. A special thank you to all of the staff, you were great, kudos to Ona, Carolina, Reuben and all the rest of you I wish I could remember your names!  All your advice and suggestions were spot on. They arranged museum tickets and a wonderful guide to see the Gaudi church and building. 
The food is top notch, the location is fantastic. You can walk pretty much anywhere in the old part of Barcelona.
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Barcelona is just a little more magical because of The Serras.",5,2015,05,31
18,Awesome boutique hotel,"The staff at The Serras were fabulous!  From the confirmation emails to check in the the restaurant.  We loved our stay here.  Caroline and Rebeca were especially friendly and helpful.  The hotel was clean, in a great location and had great food!   We had the opportunity to stay at three hotels during our visit to Barcelona and this was for sure, our favorite!! ",5,2015,05,31
18,A  new Gem,"The Serras Hotel in Barcelona was a fabulous experience.
It starts at the front desk, which is staffed by the most 
friendly helpful personal that you might ever meet, a 
smile is their name tag. Then the room which is simple 
decorated in a smart way. Finally, lets not forget the 
restaurant - a star in its own way. Yummy! As we left
the staff ran out to our taxi to tell me that i had left an 
item in the room, although i doubted it, i was wrong- i had 
left a pillow speaker and it was brought to me at the curb.
thanks Serras, and enjoy many years of helping all of us",5,2015,05,31

Relaxing rooftop bar with pool 
Contemporary peaceful room 
Everything you need for a lovely break",5,2015,05,28
18,Artful combination of culture and luxury ,"The Serras provided me with a lasting memory of my Barcelona travel experience.  The hotel staff and manager doted on my every need, routinely offering warm, welcoming greetings and conversation - in nearly every modern language you can imagine.  Greeted with a flute of champagne and a historical tour or the casually elegant property which was once Picasso's first studio in Barcelona, one could not have had a more delightful experience except to say that the Michelin chef at the hotel restaurant delivered the finest daily meals and creations. During your stay, be sure to begin your evening enjoying a glass of wine on the rooftop at sunset overlooking the marina and Gothic Quarter.  ",5,2015,05,26
18,"Amazing hotel, cant recommend enough! Cant wait to go back","We stayed at this hotel for a weekend in March to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I made the reservation before the hotel was opened as I thought that it looked like it was going to be special.  I emailed the hotel a few weeks before to ask if they would help make it special for my boyfriends birthday. On arrival, we were upgraded to a bigger room and were greeted with a Birthday balloon, a bottle of Champagne and a slice of chocolate cake! The bed was huge and we were advised their mattresses are the same as the Queens. Amazing nights sleep! The staff could not to enough for us. 

The hotel restaurant was lovely, the monk fish was so delish we had it twice!

A few weeks after returning to London, I emailed the hotel to ask where I could find the CD that was playing in the hotel bar. The hotel replied to ask me if they could send me a copy?

We cant wait to return to Barcelona, mainly to stay in this beautiful hotel!! 

5 star all the way",5,2015,05,26
18,Customer service better than the Ritz,"We stayed at The Serras Barcelona, and I was blown away by their customer service. The hotel opened this past January 2015, was super clean, sleek, and hip. Awesome rooftop bar and view. Small pool, but I think that's to be expected from a boutique hotel. All attendants spoke terrific English. Whenever I had a question about where a site was, they looked it up on googlemaps, routed it, printed it out, and highlighted the path for me. They made great recommendations for breakfast and dinner. When I checked into my room there was a handwritten note from their general manager wishing us a happy 7 year anniversary with a complementary bottle of Cava -- after the complementary drink given when first checking in. Rooms are cleverly designed and mattress was the same as the one the Queen of England sleeps on! Every evening there was a light appetizer delivered to our room, compliments of their chef (ranked 5th in Spain / their restaurant Informal has one Michelin Star). To top it off, I left a beautiful Spanish nightgown I purchased over there and they are shipping it to me in the US! Hotel is in excellent location -- your the launch pad for either the Gothic quarter (From Roman times to Medieval times) or the Barceloneta (marina / beach area) and two metro stops are close by (~7 min walk). Strong wifi (not always a given in Spain)",5,2015,05,25
18,Gem of a hotel with the exceptional customer service. Highly recommended,"We had the most wonderful time at this hotel. The staff greeted us warmly upon arrival and were very helpful. Rooms were very clean and comfortable, everything was very modern, no small detail was overlooked. The rooftop was lovely.
The location is superb, we were close to all places of interest and did not have to walk far to anything. 
Special thanks to Daniel, Cardina and Rebecca, who were incredibly attentive and made sure our stay was unforgettable. Serras management should be proud of the staff and the service.
We were very happy with our stay and will definitely come back. Muchas Gracias",5,2015,05,25

The cocktails were delicious and the service was excellent. definitely i will come back! I really recommend everyone that enjoy views & cocktails to check the rooftop of this awesome hotel!",5,2015,05,24
18,Fantastic!,"We stayed for a few days pre-cruise at the Serras. We were thoroughly impressed by every aspect we encountered. The service was great not just at the front desk, but the bellman, wait staff, managers etc. they all went out of their way to assist you. We even had a middle of the night power outage and despite the chaos, the staff did a great job informing everyone of the unusual event. We had Tapas at the restuarant and also dinner. Both excellent. The location is a very short walk to Las Ramblas and also a fairly short walk to the beach. We would stay here again in a minute.",5,2015,05,18
18,Great new luxury hotel,"This is a great hotel, in an excellent location. We spent a long weekend celebrating my husband's Birthday. The staff are extremely helpful & friendly, in particular Rebecca, who greeted us on arrival & helped throughout our stay. The hotel has history & the decor is stylish & cool. Perfect combination. Breakfast is very good too. We will definitely be returning & feel glad we chose this hotel out of the many on offer in Barcelona.",5,2015,05,15
18,Luxury and a family feeling,"Before we arrived at Hotel The Serras the staff were extremely helpful and ensured our stay was trouble free.  

The hotel is perfectly situated for Barcelona with beautiful views.  The rooms are extremely comfortable and the little touches of a welcome card, fresh fruit and a bottle of water every evening with a desert for supper add to the stay. 

The food is stunning during the day beginning at breakfast with an impressive selection of fruits, pastries and selection of cooked food.  The evening menu is a credit to the Michelin star chef and as I travelled with my mother who does not like cheese or tomatoes, nothing was too much trouble.

The gym has first class equipment.  Small but perfectly formed and I felt able to push myself in privacy which is a rarity when it comes to exercise.

Finally the staff are a credit to the hotel and genuinely helpful and attentive.

This is without doubt one of the best hotels I have stayed in and I will definitely be back.",5,2015,05,14
18,Heaven,"I knew nothing about Hotel The Serras except what I read online.  From the communications with Rebecca before I arrived to my greeting by Ona when I did, to the farewell, everything about my stay there was exceptional . The staff is so warm, friendly and helpful, the accommodations, so comfortable, ( I wanted to steal my down pillow).the food so delicious,  and the location so perfect. They really made me feel like it was my home in Barcelona.  I hated leaving.",5,2015,05,12
18,A new concept for a pleasent stay,"I spent 4 days to the Serras with my family. First of all the staff is smiling, helpful and every time at your disposal, like people that works with great passion.
My little son was in love for al the reception ladies. 
All members are ready to recognize you and satisfy your requests.
The rooms are new, well cleaned, with high quality amenities and wit a good air conditioning.
The breakfast is various and delicious, totally served at your table...than you can enjoy the lovely atmosphere.
Once tasted the restaurant on the ground floor we decide to have each dinner there, because we found great satisfaction in terms of quality and prices. 
I think the Serras is a very nice experience to feel the real spirit of Barcelona.
I hope to come back!",5,2015,05,12
18,No 1 hotel in Barcelona,"From the minute we stepped into this wonderful hotel we were treated like royalty. All of the staff are so friendly and welcoming. We arrived early so had a couple of hours to relax at the rooftop bar. The views are amazing! Again the service was impeccable and the cocktails which were customised for us were delicious!
We stayed in the deluxe room which was excellent. The waterfall shower was too good for words. To top of the whole experience there is a treat waiting for you next to your bed every evening which a cold bottle of water. I can't praise this place enough so you will need to come and see for yourself. 5/5 easy.",5,2015,05,05
18,"Stunning hotel, great location & staff helpful","Absolutely wonderful hotel with great attention to detail. Rooms modern & very clean, roof top bar area fantastic for afternoon relaxing in the sun once you've done your site seeing, restaurant great for both breakfast & dinner and staff very helpful. Also has a small gym which is perfect for a little workout.
Thorough enjoyed our stay & would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2015,05,01
18,"Great service, fabulous location, excellent hotel","From the moment we arrived this hotel lived up to the great reviews here. Welcomed with a smile and bags carried to our suite, we checked in with a glass of Cava and were given a tour of the establishment.

Highlights:
- staff throughout the hotel very friendly and helpful
- relaxing seating in the lobby, library and rooftop terrace
- restaurant had excellent atmosphere, music and food, many tables with view of a calm, laid back kitchen
- excellent variety for breakfast, including freshly prepared hot dishes and freshly squeezed orange juice
- subtle LED lighting in clean, fresh bathroom
- USB and combined UK/continental power sockets
- generous drinks on the rooftop terrace
- complimentary fruit and Cava delivered to room on first day, water and sweets in the evening

The Serras is a luxurious hotel, ideally located to walk the city. Can't wait to return.",5,2015,04,28
18,Amazing Hotel - Great Location,"The Serras exceeded our expectations! The location was perfect.  It was right by the port and a small park, and there were all kinds of little alley ways behind the hotel for local restaurants and shopping (Barri Gothic area).  It was a safe area.  From the moment of check in we got a full tour of the hotel, and the service was amazing.  They gave you good night cookies and water every night.  The service was amazing.  *****",5,2015,04,26
18,A 5 star experience,"From the moment we stepped into the hotel we were greeted by smiling faces and that continued throughout our stay. The staff couldn't do enough to help and we got some fantastic restaurant recommendations from the lady on reception (definitely go to Saboc in El Born). 

On arrival we were greeted with a glass of cava and the news that we'd been upgraded to a suite. We were there for my boyfriend's 30th and they really did go the extra mile to make it special. When we got into our room there was a bottle of cava and bowl of fruit with a lovely note from the hotel. 

The room itself was perfect with a huge bed and shower. I loved the little touch of getting a cake and a bottle of water delivered to our door each evening.

I'd really recommend eating in the restaurant, La Informal, if you're staying at The Serras. It was definitely the best food we had all weekend. I was disappointed with my cocktail but that's the only negative I can come up with, I think I just made a bad choice.

The hotel is in a perfect location, you can walk or get the metro everywhere and it was close to my favourite place for going out: El Born. And despite how central it is, it was very quiet in our room.

I didn't get to enjoy the terrace and pool because we had such a packed itinerary but it would be a lovely place to hangout and has great views.

I will definitely stay at The Serras again - hopefully next time I'll stay in the Picasso room.",5,2015,04,22
18,Great hotel in a great location,"We were a business traveller group of 4 and stayed for 3 nights.
I booked via another booking website and was called to confirm before arrival, I requested rooms with marina view and was granted!
Check in was fast. The rooms were a bit tiny, but is beautiful and you have everything. I had to wake up at 6 or 7 every morning and could see the sunrise from my room, a perfect way to start the day. Breakfast offers a wide selection although I didn't know they also serve hot dishes until I was full so the next day I ordered and it was great. I like how all the staffs were very friendly and always smiling and eager to serve. From the receptionist to the housekeeper to the bellboy (Especially the bellboy guy). Although one morning, the breakfast waitress said something that come out wrong and was perceived as a bit rude and she said 'it was a joke' and apologised, but I have to give it that she handled it well and proceed to continue her services nicely. Rooftop balcony is every beautiful and the view was just stunning. The only regret is that I didn't had the chance to use it. Will stay here again next time.",5,2015,04,20
18,Great hotel!,"I've been to this hotel for two nights and it was a really nice experience. It's a good hotel with very friendly and helpfull people. There was a hospitable welcome and great service. The people were really interested in our well-being. I will never forget this hotel, because it gave me great memories (my engagement) to cherish. 

One advice for further improvement: the noise because of the partying people in the street. Though the beds are great, we haven't slept much because of all the noise. It's difficult to imagine the windows really are soundproof. 

If i would win the lottery, i would definitely come back! 😀",4,2015,04,19
18,Fantastic Hotel and 5 star service from Carolina.,We just arrived and already felt we had to leave a great review. Carolina welcomed us and showed us around the hotel. We received a bottle of champagne in our room for our 30th wedding anniversary. It made us feel very special. The room and rooftop terrace are stunning. We highly recommend you stay here when in Barcelona.,5,2015,04,17
18,Perfect Boutique Hotel,"Didn't know what to expect when booking this relatively new hotel in Barcelona (other than the fact that it had a spectacular roof-top terrace/pool).  We were terrifically surprised by the chic décor, generous and beautifully decorated rooms and, most importantly, by the kind and helpful staff. Also, one of our best meals in Barcelona was at the Hotel's own restaurant, ""Informal.""  On top of all of this, it is located in the romantic gothic quarter, and adjacent to the lovely sea-side park.  Don't know that you could ask for anything more in a hotel... we certainly couldn't.  It was simply the best hotel we've stayed in in years.",5,2015,04,15
18,Wonderful Hotel,"Our first impression was a wonderful greeting by the reception staff and the porters who whisked away our car after unloading our luggage. We were offered drinks while we were checked into the hotel and then offered a tour of the facilities.
It is a beautiful modern hotel with a lovely restaurant and a bar on the first floor. We had a lovely twin room with two balconies and the hotel is close to the Marina  and the old town. The food was amazing enough for us to book a table for our second night and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful if they had tried.
We cannot recommend the hotel enough.",5,2015,04,13
18,Fantastic spot,"This is, hands down, the best hotel we have stayed at in Spain; In fact, I am hard pressed to think of any hotel I've ever stayed at which matches it for service. The staff here are kind, helpful, insightful, and attentive to every detail. The accommodations are beautiful, stylish, and comfortable. The location is within walking distance of all parts of Born and the gothic quarter. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2015,04,12
18,Nice location at clean and relaxing hotel,"The location of this hotel was perfect. Located by the harbour area with many options of restaurants and nice walking area, but only steps away from the Gothic Quarters where you also easily could walk to commercial shopping areas. 

The hotel was very new - you could smell fresh paint in the corridors - in a good way. The reception area was very welcoming, and all the staff was very smiling, helpful and interested in you as a guest. 

We had breakfast, some light dinner and room service at the hotel and the food was very good. The breakfast was a treat with delicious bread and fresh fruits, and the room service hamburger was really really good and cannot be classified as junk food ;) The interior of the restaurant was modern.

The rooms had nice wooden floor and modern furniture. All very clean. A large bed with many choices of pillows. Bathroom was very nice with a bubble bath. 
The size of the room were a bit small  -we had a junior suite for us and our 2 year old. This was Ok for a couple of days, but would have looked for a bigger suite if we were to stay longer.  Also the room we stayed in seemed to be a connecting room, and the locked door to the other room seemed to have some noise issues, we could hear the neighbours talking and listening to music, so the sound isolation should have been better.

The hotel was a bit difficult to find because the GPS didn't have it, and we couldn't find it while driving past. Hopefully the hotel will invest in a bigger hotel sign so it is easier to spot - and GPS will eventually have an update ..

Very happy with our stay at the Serras, and would happily visit this hotel again.",5,2015,04,06
18,"Wow, wow, wow","If you enjoy Cava on arrival and great service throughout, this is the place to stay.

All of the staff were friendly and attentive. 

The decor everywhere is fabulous, the rooftop pool and terrace are spectacular and the cocktails are amazing.

The food, from the Michelin starred chef is excellent, both dinner and breakfast.

A very relaxing and enjoyable stay in a boutique hotel located ideally for just about everything.

We will be back!

",5,2015,04,06
18,Excellent little hotel,"A superb little hotel that makes you feel very welcome! There is a luxurious feel about all aspects of the hotel. Breakfast was fantastic, and the michelin star restaurant is a delicious choice. All staff are extremely friendly and helpful, would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,04,05
18,"Nice location, exceptional breakfast!","The location is nice next to El Born with its nice atmosphere and lovely tapas bars.
The breakfast is exceptional! The staff is attentive and service minded, and the rooms are clean! 

The downside is the noise from the streets. The room is far from soundproof when one is kept awake from the people partying in the streets at 3am. ",4,2015,04,04
18,Memorable stay,"The Serras provided a unique experience right from check-in: instead of standing at the end of a journey weighed down by luggage waiting for the paperwork to be gradually filled in, we sat at a desk with a chilled glass of cava and caught our breath while the work was being done. All of the staff were genuine, friendly, fun, and highly professional. The hotel is new, and so our suite was contemporary and classy. The location is excellent, opposite the harbour and a couple of minutes walk from La Rambla. Usually I avoid hotel restaurants as they tend to be of average quality and over-priced, but this time it came highly recommended and so we gave it a try. It was probably the best restaurant experience I have had. Outstanding, incredibly fresh food, and we had matched wines recommended by the highly knowledgeable sommelier. Definitely book a table during your stay. We arrived after a week at The Ritz Madrid, and while this was very sumptuous and elegant, we had a much more relaxed and fun stay at The Serras.",5,2015,04,04
18,Perfect! Just Perfect!,"The Serras for us (2 adults + 4 year old) really exceeded our expectations. We have been travelling for the past month and stayed in numerous 5 star hotels and for us The Serras was by far the best. 
It's a beautiful boutique hotel, rooms are lovely and our balcony overlooked the Passeig de Colom. A few minutes walk to the Marina Port Vell where they have plenty off lovely restaurants to choose from.
A 10 minute walk to La Ramblas. 
The highlight of our stay, especially when travelling with a child, was the warm hospitality. We were greeted from the moment we stepped out from the taxi until the moment we left, with our last view of the Serras being the lovely concierge gentleman waving us goodbye. 
Maima was our first contact when arriving and she recommended places for us to visit/eat and happily made our reservations.
The housekeeping were fantastic and work very hard. What we love especially were the little things; bottled water and a yummy dessert next to our bed in a freshly cleaned room before bedtime. 
The decor is gorgeous, and rooms and bathrooms spacious. The shower was amazing. 
Well done to Antonio and his staff. You are all doing a fantastic job! 
We are already planning our next visit! 
So highly recommended.
Beautiful hotel, perfect location and service impeccable!",5,2015,03,31
18,Memorable Experience  ,"I had a great experience in this new jewel of Barcelona. The staff is very friendly and very professional, during my stay i felt to be at home, they have anticipated all my needs. The room and the bathroom are stunning, from the design to all the comforts you may need. The food at the ""Informal"" restaurant is simply delicious, nice atmosphere and excellent service. What to say more? I think this hotel got the perfect concept of the modern hospitality, informal and impeccable service. I will definately come back.",5,2015,03,30
18,First Class Hotel,"Great hotel, nice appointments including its stylish appearance. Attentive and friendly staff. Enjoyed their resturant including a first class breakfast and dinner. The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to La Rambla and the waterfront. I loved Barcelona and will visit the city again and plan to stay at The Serras as well.",5,2015,03,25
18,Exceptional hotel with wonderful staff,"Fabulous boutique hotel in a very convenient location. I'm not sure where to start- everything was perfect- the room, the food, the service, the ambiance. If I have one very small niggle, it's that the photo of the pool is a little deceptive (it's not much bigger than a large bath), but that's only because I'm an exercise junkie and wanted to swim (other proper swimming pools are available). Great location for a run along the beach and/ or up MontJuic. It's by far the best hotel I've stayed in for a very long while and would win it on the customer service hands down.",5,2015,03,24
18,really nice,"Hotel just pegged in January so everything is new and beautiful. Location is great. Bashar is especially nice. Service is really excellent and personal. Only complaint is a small fault in the design of the room. They put the shower right next to the head of the bed behind a glass wall. So, whether it's the light or the noise of the shower, don't count on sleeping a bit longer if your spouse is showering. ",4,2015,03,23
18,Amazing stay at The Serras Barcelona,"This exclusive and distinctive boutique hotel was a premier choice for our family vacation; perfectly located across from the marina, steps from the Gothic Quarter and walking distance to the Metro and La Rambla.  The hotel design, attention to room detail, menu and food presentation, and personal service throughout our 4 night stay was second to known ( better than anything else).  The staff greeted you as if you were apart on their family. We found a second home in Barcelona at this luxury hotel.  

",5,2015,03,19
18,Best Boutique Hotel,"Excellent! This boutique hotel is the best we have stayed in and we are already planning our return visit next time we will visit europe. The decor, the service, the location are second to none.....the staff really are genuinely, helpful, friendly and want to make your stay pleasureable, nothing is too much trouble for them. The rooms have many little extra touches which add to the quirkiness of the hotel and the size is impressive. Oh, and don't forget to try the breakfast!!!
If i need to highlighted 3 good points, definitely:
- Amazing Bed
- Large Bathrooms
- Very good soundproofed",5,2015,03,15
18,We loved it!,"From the beginning to the end this was an exceptional stay. The welcome was amazing, they knew our name and they gave us a Cataln Champagne to drink while doing the check in. Our Grand Deluxe Room was very large with a sofa area ideal for having breakfast in the morning and we even had two balconies! 
We had dinner at the restaurant the first night and we repeated the following nights. Exceptional food and very nice staff

We felt at home and we will definitely come back next year!",5,2015,03,15
18,""" A little luxury gem in Barcelona city centre""","The Serras is a small gem hotel in a wonderful neighbourhood; close to the  Ramblas, Museums and walking distance to many sights. The hotel has lovely food and drinks options, very attentive staff, and wonderful service. Rooms are large, comfortable and clean!!! The location is amazing!!  We loved staying here! We will definitely come back.",5,2015,03,13
18,"good hotel, good location","The hotel is brand new, stylish, very modern and good-located with very welcoming service. The breakfast is excellent, and I mark its restaurant style. The roof pool is small but really nice with lovely view on the port. The gym is however very small. The hotel is ideal for high quality but not  special stay. For a special event it is better to look for something more exciting as it is good but not breath taking. But for our purpose (quality reasonable stay) it was fine, and I would return for this kind of stay to the hotel with pleasure.",4,2015,03,10
18,Fantastic new luxury hotel!,"We are regular visitors of Barcelona, and were eager to try this perfectly located, new boutique hotel that opened on the steps of the old town and the harbour. The hotel is very slick and modern, with all the amenities and comforts you expect from a 5* hotel, including a wonderful rooftop terrrace where we enjoyed great cocktails while taking in a beautiful view. The rooms are decently sized given the prime location, very luxurious and with great views overlooking the marina, and all of the common areas are decorated with designer features which make the hotel trendy and hip. What makes the hotel really special is the fabulous staff: everyone, from the general manager down, is incredibly attentive, always making every effort to make your stay more enjoyable, and providing a real wealth of tips and recommendations on what to do and where to eat, making you live Barcelona like a real Catalunyan! We will definitely be back in our next trip to Barcelona!",5,2015,03,08
18,Nice new opened 5 star in Barcelona,"Must say I was not impressed by the hotel during my first visit to Barcelona last year though the Serras managed to change that.  

They provide the best customer service I have had within Europe and the price is rather affordable.  All facilities at the hotel are brand new despite rooms in general is not massive.  The only complaint will be the 2 sheets covered duvet - please get a duvet cover!!!!  I almost strangled myself on the first night after waking up with all those sheets around me.  

P.s hotel location is perfectly in front of old town and facing the harbor!  We also found our fav tapas bar in town based on reception's recommendation.  Definitely will revisit.",5,2015,03,03
18,"Brilliant, new hotel!","We stayed here Monday to Friday soon after opening. It was a great relaxing stay, the location just off the harbour was stunning, we got a view of the yachts from our twin balconies. The staff are what makes it great, they simply can't do enough for you. The area around the hotel has some fab bars and tapas restaurants we used it as  abase to explore on foot all around the gothic quarter.",5,2015,03,02
18,Oasis of personal luxury in Barcelona,"Me and my wife are frequent travellers with an extensive track record of staying at the most gorgeous European hotels. Believe me or not, but this is the first time when we feel like we must recommend a hotel on the pages of this website.

We spent a romantic weekend in Barcelona on St. Valentine' Day. It was our first time in magnificent Barcelona. Needless to say how perfect accommodation may affect the overall impression from the trip. And this is what some hoteliers may help you with. The old building of the hotel on the picturesque embankment of Passeig de Colom has been beautifully restored to meet the highest standards of modern hospitality. In contrast to other contemporary design properties in Barcelona which we have considered for our stay, The Serras does not embarrass with the radical designer features. It has rather friendly, soft and trendy style with a mix of warm colours and rich textures. Spacious rooms with wooden floors, Lowe 50' inch HD TV set and French windows. A VERY comfortable and cozy bed with crispy linen, light and soft pillows let the guest have a nice rest. 

As regards further improvements we would probably advise to fill 'mirror shelfs' with books, vases or some other items in order to get rid of that awkward emptiness. Moreover, showering would become easier if there was at least one holder of toiletries in the shower cabin which is otherwise outstanding.

The hotel has a TOP location just opposite the city's marina. It takes less than 10 minutes of relaxed walking to reach the Columbus column. Unlike guests of the W or The Arts, while staying in The Serras you will not require taxi rides to see magnificent sights of the Southern part of the city (Ramblas, Catedral, Picasso museum, etc.). At the same time, there's just a walking distance to the beach. This is the reason why we found the hotel perfectly located for both sightseeing and leisure trips.

Do not be upset to find The Serras standing on a quite busy road (obviously, it is not a highway, but anyway there are at least two lanes on each side for a regular traffic). However, it is not that busy as Passeig de Gràcia or Diagonal avenue. There's almost no noise coming from the street due to the great sound proofing of the rooms (double glazing of windows is perfect). Smartly planned central ventilation system as well as carpets in the corridors and the thickest doors I've ever seen in my life create an atmosphere of silence and privacy. We have switched off the minibar which was a bit more noisy than it should have been. Therefore, this place may be suggested even to such sensitive sleepers like us.

Although we faced quite a number of problems upon arrival (which I suspect have been caused by the novelty of the property), we have been surrounded by thoughtful care of the hotel's staff who managed to resolve most of them. Special thanks goes to Ona Matas who did her best to treat us as very special guests. Frankly speaking, the hotel's team could not simply do better to make our first stay in Barcelona so comfortable!

We have spent truly unforgettable time in Barcelona. We are looking forward to return to The Serras next time we are in the city.",5,2015,02,28
18,Awesome hotel with awesome care,"Thank you Mr. Serras for the your perfect hotel!

We was traveling with little baby boy (1,7 year old). Hotel care about our baby – they are provided baby bath towel, little toy and perfect baby coat! Also our baby likes pasta bolognesa for the launch :)

So, if you want have a good time in Barcelona - this hotel is what do you need! Don't look to other hotels - just choose Hotel The Serras and forget about any troubles!",5,2015,02,26
18,Weekend in the city,"We chose this hotel for a romantic weekend off. The hotel has a marvelously chosen decoration and a sublime customer treatment by the hotel staff.
Beds were stunningly comfortable, worst part was trying to leave !! :))
Breakfast was really delicious, was a pity we couldn't fully enjoy the upper terrace due to bad weather conditions, on a sunny day the views have to be awesome.
They have a restaurant with delicious food, with live Dj Friday nights.
Location is great, next to the city center and in front of the port. Next to lots of bars and shops.
We really enjoyed our stay there, and definitely will go back as soon as we can!",5,2015,02,25
18,Gorgeous stay,"Newly opened hotel in a strategic place in Barcelona. I have been upgraded right on my arrival ! Rooms are very nice, modern, design and totally sound proof. The beds are very very confortable. Bathrooms are large. The staff is more than friendly, helpful at all moments. Antoine the director is very affordable and always ask for feedbacks...Worth the money !",5,2015,02,19
18,Brilliant Boutique Hotel,"Just opened, beautifully finished, with superb food and service. As a regular visitor to Barcelona this is a new home from home. The rooms are spacious, light and quiet, despite being on the doorstep of the old city and overlooking the harbour, for an evening wind down a drink on the roof terrace is a must.",5,2015,02,11
18,February Get Away!,"Location: the location of the hotel is perfect! It is a 5 minute walk to the top of Ramblas and directly behind the hotel, there are lots of bars, restaurants and shops. It is in a very safe area, directly across from the Marina with lots to do. It was roughly a 15 minute journey to the airport and both taxis costs us around 30 euros.

Room: the rooms are amazing! Whatever we didn't already have, with one call to reception the items were brought to us within 5 minutes each time. The beds are very comfortable, the towels are soft, the bathroom is high tech and the shower is one of the strongest showers we have had. We opted for a junior suite and had a seating area which was perfect for our mid afternoon naps!

Food: we only had breakfast at the hotel once while we were there as we opted to eat on the go a lot of the time but it was really nice. Lots of fruit, pastries and hot food to order. The staff were attentive and couldn't have done more to look after us. 

Staff: 9/10 of the staff at the hotel couldn't have done more to help us! While we were there (4 days, 3 nights) I did not have to open a door or pull out a chair once. We had a ""mix up"" with our room where we had booked a Junior Suite Sea View via Booking.com but were given a Junior Suite City View and were not given a room on a higher floor as we had requested. The room we were in was amazing so, I went down to the reception for more of an explanation than anything else and to see what the hotel could do for us. I was informed that there were no other rooms available but the hotel was not busy, so I found this quite hard to believe. The lady who checked us in remained polite, apologised and I could genuinely see on her face that she wanted to try and do something to ease our disappointment but her colleague (I am assuming a manager as she took over the conversation) was in plain, quite rude. I did not expect to be moved right there and then but some form of compensation or good will gesture would not have gone a miss as I headed back to my room quite disappointed which was not the start to our trip I had expected.

Before we arrived we were not informed that the gym, roof top bar and pool would all be out of order while we were there as they had not yet finished them which was a slight disappointment but there is enough in Barcelona to keep anyone occupied! The work is still on going at the hotel (our hallway was filled with ladders, work tools and carpet cuttings on 2 of the days) but it is heading in the right direction.",4,2015,02,09
18,Impressed,"I have recently visited this new amazing hotel and I am impressed about the quality of service, attention to detailes, elegance and style.
From the check-in until check-out, the staff made me feel important, all of them professional, friendly and attentive.
The breakfast was stunning and the spacious rooms are incredible! I will definitely go back as soon i visit Barcelona again.",5,2015,02,07
18,An Amazing Experience.,"I had a wonderful stay in this new gem of the city. The decor of the hotel is really stylish. A really warmth welcome upon check in. The staff is really friendly and very professional, they have paid attention for every details through all my stay, i felt to be at home. I had an amazing breakfast with large selection of Spanish and international products. The room and the bathroom are stunning, very spacious with all the conforts I needed. I highly recommend this hotel and definitively I will be back.",5,2015,02,01
18,Great new hotel in Barcelona,"I often travel to Barcelona on business and I found the Serras Hotel to be a great addition to the city’s hotel scene. I generally prefer smaller hotels when I travel and I opted to spend two nights there when I was last in town for business. 
The hotel has just opened, the facilities are brand new, the design is pleasant and the personnel very attentive. Location is great making it convenient for business but also enjoyable for a night out.
The hotel restaurant, offer a great option for dining in, I had dinner there on the first night and enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere.
Other things that I also appreciated about the Serras were the breakfast, the fast check-out as well as the wifi connection that worked perfectly.
All in all the hotel offers great value for money and I will definitely go back.",5,2015,01,28
18,"Welcoming staff, stylish hotel","I just stayed at The Serras hotel and was very impressed.  The staff had such a warm demeanour, they made me feel right at home immediately. They were extremely kind and helpful when it came to directions, or making meal reservations, etc. Every request I made was met with a smile and prompt assistance. 
The hotel is brand new - stylish, with beautiful decor and care in the details. My room had a step-out balcony with a beautiful view of the harbourfront. The bed was extremely comfortable and overall it was one of the coolest/most beautiful rooms I've ever stayed in. (To give some context, I've travelled  to 30+ countries and typically stay in 4 & 5+ star hotels). 

I am certain The Serras will be a hotspot very soon, definitely the new hidden (for now) gem.  
They have a beautiful terrace out front which I am sure will be perfect for sipping wine at string out at the harbour in the summer. 

The dinner and dessert I had at Marc Gascon's restaurant 'Informal' was delicious. I later learned he is a Michelin star chef and this is one of his breakout restaurants. Another reason why I'm sure this will be a new hotspot very soon. 

Finally, the location is amazing. The Serras is located between the beach and the city, and about 10min walking in any direction puts you at one of Barcelona's must-see areas: the beaches and boardwalk areas, old town, gothic quarter, La Rambla, etc.

18,Attention & perfection,"Unobtrusively elegant, the Hotel Serras joins the buildings of the old town. The small stylish lobby with its high glass fronts floods the room with plenty of light. Cool drinks and homemade chocolate are served at check-in. Immediately you feel as a guest that you are welcome.

We had a superior room on the third floor. The first impression continues here... drinks, small attentions and a handwritten welcome card on the small table in front of the bed. A very spacious bathroom with double lavabo and a rain shower. Particularly noteworthy is the heavenly comfortable bed, not a given for a good hotel as we have learned. A small balcony overlooking the side alley of the old town. Who cares it might be too loud as the hotel is located on the main street of the port, the window is double glazed, you hear absolutely nothing. Also noteworthy is the cleanliness of the room as well as generally in the hotel.

There is a restaurant run by Michelin-star chef Marc Gascons, a gym and a roof terrace with a small pool and magnificent views over the harbour area. The bar mixes delicious drinks.

From the hotel you are on foot in about 10-15 min. on the seafront, as well as right at the beginning of the old town with its various shops and restaurants. Perfect location.

All in all a great stay. Although the price is slightly higher, the relationship to what is offered is justified. The hotel deserves its stars in every way. Attention and perfection in all areas. One of the best hotels we stayed in.",5,2024,08,23
18,MARVELOUS,"Very well-kept and very clean structure, rooms with every comfort and also very clean, excellent service, the staff is always available for every request, even the restaurant on the roof top is of excellent quality.

18,"The best hotel I have ever been to, with the most attentive and pleasant staff.","Staying in this hotel has been a success. The exquisite chocolate in the shape of the hotel's logo and the glass of cava that they give you when you arrive, is a true declaration of intentions of what the Serras is. Elizabeth welcomed us with great kindness and closeness, and accompanied us through the different rooms of the hotel, in addition to making us some great restaurant recommendations for dinner; We loved his close and warm treatment; and we were able to verify that this friendliness and good work are a trademark of the house. Carla Serra, the Operations Manager, was also charming with us and the detail of leaving us a handwritten welcome note in the room was a real touch. And finally, we would like to highlight the person in charge of the breakfasts, Sandra, for her excellent treatment, professionalism, friendliness and warmth. Thanks to her we were able to enjoy the best breakfast we have ever eaten; Everything is super carefully cared for and above all, with great care. Without a doubt, we will return to Serras Hotel.",5,2023,12,05

18,Magnificent boutique hotel,"Magnificent boutique hotel.
Comfortable, generally well designed, however, it deserves more simplicity both for the reception of the client and for the arrangements. We are not disabled and can help ourselves.
Some things to check:
- It is not possible to regulate the flow of water in the shower, which is a shame because it generates excessive consumption of this liquid that is very precious to us.
- The shower head slides easily between your hands.
- The shower screen lets water pass out of the shower!
-The shower floor is slippery!
- The breakfast service is not up to par with what the very rich menu offers.
- We couldn't find the main switch in the room?
- Thank you for your welcome and see you soon.",5,2023,10,15

My stay at this lovely boutique hotel was truly exceptional. From the moment I arrived, I felt welcome and pampered. The detail of receiving a bottle of champagne in my room was a touch that I really appreciated. The design of the hotel is simply charming, with an aesthetic that combines elegance and style perfectly. Additionally, the staff was friendly and attentive at all times. Without a doubt, a very pleasant experience that I hope to repeat in the future.

18,Hotel muy recomendable con excelente gestión y Dirección,"Excelente hotel con magnífica gestión por su Dirección, con un personal muy atento y servicial, con una ubicación envidiable, habitación cómoda y con todo tipo de detalles, hotel muy recomendable y al que si duda volveremos. Precio y calidad van de la mano. Excepcional experiencia.",5,2023,06,29
18,El Serras Hotel es una decepción,"El hotel es lujoso, glamuroso, caro y no está bien gestionado. El personal es joven y con ganas de agradar, abriendo puertas y revoloteando y tal. Pero no se enfocan en las cosas importantes. Las habitaciones están mal diseñadas: mucho espacio sin ninguna característica que te haga sentir cómodo: poco espacio para guardar ropa o para trabajar; cuartos de baño de lujo sin estantes, duchas y lavabos elegantes pero con fugas; las fundas nórdicas estaban lujosas pero sucias. El hotel anuncia vistas al mar o al ciudad, pero la mayoría de las habitaciones no tienen ninguna—la mayoría dan al callejón contiguo al hotel. Además: muchos servicios son súper caros: más de €250 por una pequeña colada; los precios de las bebidas y los aperitivos en la azotea también son súper caros. No volveremos. Hay hoteles mejores: más cómodos y con buena relación calidad-precio. El Serra no lo es.",2,2023,05,09

Alle Mitarbeiter waren herzlich und sehr professionell, Kundenservice in perfektem Maße. Vom Empfang über das Housekeeping bis zur Bar und den Mitarbeitern in der Gastronomie, jede einzelne Person lebt den Job und ist zu 100% für die Gäste da. 

Das gesamte Hotel ist wundervoll ausgestattet und unglaublich sauber.

Unser Zimmer war ausreichend gross und ebenfalls sehr schön und man konnte quasi vom Boden essen.
Zudem wurden wir mit einer persönlichen Karte, kleinen spanischen Snacks, Cava und Wasser empfangen. Zudem bot man bei jeder Gelegenheit Hilfe an und erledigte alle Anliegen innerhalb von Sekunden und mit maximaler Freundlichkeit.

Die Qualität von Getränken und Speisen war ebenfalls bestens. Beim nächsten Mal besuchen wir sicher auch das im Hotel ansässige Restaurant informal, welches ebenfalls einen schönen Eindruck macht.

Alles in allem also perfekt und man wandert zudem auf den Spuren Picassos, der in diesem Haus sein erstes Atelier und er Gegend unterhielt…

Natürlich nicht ganz günstig, aber es lohnt sich und wir kommen wieder, ganz sicher….",5,2022,12,04

Bueno, si conozco el nombre de una persona del hotel y de la que me gustaría hacer una pequeña reseña, Sandra, eso sí, utilizándola como estandarte del resto de compañeras y compañeros que trabajan con ella.
La conozco desde la primera vez que fui a comer al restaurante El Informal, solo decir que es una de las personas más maravillosas que he tenido la suerte de conocer, tanto profesionalmente como personalmente.
Dicho esto sobre las personas que hacen posible la calidad personal del establecimiento en todas sus facetas, referir unos apuntes sobre el hotel que desconocía.
Habitación perfecta, tanto en la desinfección por el tema COVID-19 como por las comodidades, decoración minimalista, para que cargar más, y la calidad en sí.
La terraza El Sueño, habilitada por razones COVID-19 como restaurante, donde he podido disfrutar, atendido por Sandra y un compañero suyo, de una cena maravillosa.
Los desayunos son completos, tienen desayuno continental y a la carta, donde puedes elegir diferentes productos, todos ellos buenísimos y de calidad. Lo único que no pude elegir fue la persona encargada de atenderme, aunque me alegré mucho de ello, Sandra estuvo como siempre perfecta en la atención tanto personal como profesional.
Si me pidieran que destacara algo del hotel en sí, diría que destacaría a las personas que hacen posible que Barcelona tenga uno de los mejores hoteles y gastronomía de la Ciudad Condal.
Como bien dicen por aquí, destacar igualmente que tiene una situación perfecta para disfrutar del puerto, acercarse a Las Ramblas, etc., dando un buen paseo sin apenas moverse del hotel.
Igualmente se puede disfrutar de unas bonitas vistas del puerto, de tranquilidad…
Lo recomendaría? Por supuesto.
Tal y como reza ek título, que más se puede pedir…",5,2021,01,27

Der Empfang war freundlich. Das Zimmer war modern eingerichtet, sauber - jedoch nicht allzu gross. Die darunter liegende Gasse war abends leider sehr belegt, weshalb ein Schlafen bei offenem Fenster nicht möglich war.
Die Bar und Pool auf dem Dach war sowie am Abend als auch über Tag ein absolutes Highlight. Wunderschön.

Colazione abbondante e gustosa, soprattuto la cameriera Italiana che ci ha servito la colazione è stata molto gentile e a modo.

Il cibo della colazione ha un sapore molto delicato. 

La vista dal roof-top regala forti emozioni, soprattuto al calar del sole accompagnato da un calice di vino o cocktail. 

Inoltre quando siamo andati a cena e poi tornati in stanza abbiamo trovato tutto sistemato per la notte e la stanza ripulita e un dolcetto come desert prima di andare a letto. Veramente un ottimo servizio.

Zu mäkeln gibt es rein gar nichts. Die Dachtereasse ein Traum. Das Personal super freundlich und hilfsbereit und sind in fast jeder europäischen Sprache ansprechbar.

Und wir werden definitiv wieder kommen, nicht nur weil Barcelona eine schöne Stadt ist sondern auch das Hotel einfach fantastisch ist.  Was ich immer wieder auf meinen Reisen merke, das in den meisten Fällen Familien geführte Unternehmen die besten sind. Wir hatten die Suite mit Meerblick, in manchen Rezessionen habe ich gelesen das es zu laut ist da es direkt an der Straße liegt. Dies kann ich nicht bestätigen, die Zimmer sind super schallisoliert.

Die Hotelzimmer sind sehr schön und geräumig eingerichtet. Obwohl das Hotel an einer sehr befahrenen Strasse liegt ist es im Zimmer sehr ruhig, da die Fenster 2 x doppelverglast sind. Im ganzen Hotel duftet es sehr gut, nach einem feinen dezenten Raumduft.
Die Rooftopbar ist klein aber sehr gemütlich und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Vor allem die Aussicht auf den Yachthafen und die Marina sind der Hammer.
Das Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche offen und man kann für 29 Euro Buffet oder à la carte bestellen.
Das Abendessen im Restaurant Informal war auch sehr gut und wird mit frischen und saisonalen Produkten zubereitet.

Io sono una fan del brand Design Hotels a cui The Serras è affiliato e che da' il meglio di sé in questa struttura sia per l'ambiente che per il servizio. La lobby è molto accogliente ed il personale della reception è attento e disponibile. Il servizio in generale è ottimo, di lusso ma allo stesso tempo friendly. Gli spazi comuni come pure le camere sono arredati con gusto ed il design è molto piacevole e luminoso. Le camere (io avevo una superior quindi la base) sono ampie e funzionali, con tutto il necessario per un soggiorno piacevole e confortevole. La terrazza e la piscina sul rooftop sono piccoline ma molto cozy. La colazione è varia, abbondante e di ottima qualità.

Das Personal ist äusserst freundlich, hilfsbereit und verleiht dem Hotel eine familiäre Stimmung. Das Frühstück bietet eine grosse und teilweise exquisite Auswahl. Die Lage ist optimal und wir konnten viele Erkundungen zu Fuss unternehmen. Die Dachterrasse mit Pool und Bar ist einfach genial. Besonders hervorheben möchte ich noch den äusserst freundlichen und unkomplizierten Umgang mit unseren Kids (6 Monate und 3 Jahre). Wir wissen dies sehr zu schätzen und das ist nicht in jedem 5-Stern Hotel so. Herzlichen Dank. Wir kommen wieder!",5,2017,04,21
18,Wunderschönes Hotel,"Wir haben den Aufenthalt in diesem ausgesprochen guten Hotel sehr genossen. Da stimmt einfach alles. Das Personal war sehr zuvorkommend und hat geholfen, wo es nur konnte jedoch ohne aufdringlich zu wirken.

18,Durchwegs zu empfehlen!,"Kleines, modernes Hotel, daher nahezu familiäre Atmosphäre. Sehr freundliches und zuvorkommendes Personal. Fast schon ein bisschen zuviel... ;-) 
Erste Kontaktaufnahme erfolgte schon im Vorfeld mit Fragen nach Extrawünschen, wie Transfer, Ernährungsproblemen o.ä.
Spektakuläre Dachterrasse mit tollem Blick über den Hafen. Hervorragende Schalldämmung der Fenster, trotz Nähe zur vielbefahrenen Straße. Sehr gute Lage direkt am alten gotischen Viertel. Lediglich eine WC-Bürste hat gefehlt...",5,2017,04,05
18,Super 5 Sterne Boutique Hotel,"1. Lage: Sehr schöne Lage für Stadtreise; Altstadt, La Rambla, Häfen und Strände fußläufig entfernt. Das Hotel liegt an einer großen und viel befahrenen aber recht schönen Palmenallee, dahinter befindet sich direkt die Hafenpromenade. Unser Zimmer zur Straße (Junior Suite Sea View) hatte aber gut isolierte Fenster, die Straße ist nachts gedämmt vernehmbar aber nicht störend.

2. Ausstattung/Einrichtung: sehr geschmackvoll und modern, die Fotos versprechen nicht zu viel. Das Hotel ist kleiner als wir erwartet hatten. Ein paar über das normale 5-Sterne Niveau hinausgehende Features (dem Duschwasser kann mittels einer Schatulle Öl beigefügt werden; Smartphone für unterwegs mit kostenlosem Internet und kostenlosem Telefonieren). Manchmal siegt das Design über die Funktion, das Restaurant Besteck gleicht Puppenbesteck, aber kaum der Rede wert. Sehr empfehlenswert ist die Dachterrasse!

3. Essen: Das Frühstücksbüffet ist klein aber fein (sehr gute Qualität der Speisen), die zusätzlichen a la carte Optionen lassen keine Wünsche offen. Die Roomservice Gerichte hatten ausgesprochen gute Qualität! Das Abendrestaurant haben wir nicht getestet.

4. Personal/Service: durch die Bank auf eine unkomplizierte Art bemerkenswert nett, freundlich, angenehm und hilfsbereit. Ein offenkundig sehr gut geführtes Haus!",5,2017,03,12
18,Nicht zu unrecht in der TOP10 Barcelonas,"Das Boutiquehotel The Serras besticht durch eine tolle Lage unmittelbar gegenüber des Yachthafens und unweit der Ramblas. Klein und fein mit sehr freundlichem Service und ausgefallen schönen, wohnlichen Zimmern. Ein Hotel, in dem man sich vom ersten Moment wohlfühlt. Auch das integrierte kleine Restaurant ist sehr zu empfehlen und besticht durch guten Service und hervorragende Qualität zu moderaten Preisen.
Auf der obersten Etage findet man einen kleinen aber sehr sympathischen Poolbereich mit kleiner netter Outdoorbar, an der man nach umfangreicher Shoppingtour gepflegt den Nachmittag ausklingen lassen kann.
Und wenn der Check-In - und vor allem der Check-Out nicht endlos lange gedauert hätte - jeweils 15-20 Minuten! (hier fehlt noch Routine der jungen Mitarbeiterinnen) - dann hätte man ohne jedes Zögern sofort die volle Punktzahl geben können. Aber das klappt sicher in den nächsten Wochen auch noch...",4,2017,03,07
18,"Lujo, calidad y exquisitez con cercanía","Estar en este hotel es como si te metieras en una burbuja para alejarte de todo. La calidad y el cuidado por todos y cada uno de los detalles es lo que llama la atención en este pequeño hotel boutique donde te hacen sentir como un cliente seleccionado, exclusivo, único. 
Una recepción discreta sin alardes de pretender nada excepto atender al cliente desde la cercanía y la cordialidad, aportando toda información necesaria para éste. Un edificio con historia, con una parte donde aún se conservan ruinas del pasado histórico de la ciudad que tanto caracteriza al barrio donde se ubica el hotel.
Una terraza de diseño, con una pequeña piscina para refrescarte mientras tienes una buena copa de calidad en tu mano, mientras disfrutas de las vistas del puerto de Barcelona.
Un restaurante cuyo nombre es apropiado para lo que es ""Informal"" de la mano de Marc Gastons (uno de los dos propietarios del restaurante Els Tinars de Santa Cristina de Aro) donde la comida es excelente, se cuida el producto, la presentación y el detalle innovador para cada uno de los platos. Un restaurante en un hotel que rompe esquemas con la idea que tenemos de este tipo de restaurantes (sobriedad, clasicismo, platos que no sorprenden, excesivos de precio). Informal es todo lo contrario. No es barato pero te aporta mil sensaciones en cada comida o cena.
Realmente, es el mejor hotel de Barcelona!!",5,2017,01,28
18,Una sensanción como la pelicula de Pretty Women.,"Entramos el viernes 20-1-16 para celebrar el cumpleaños de mi marido y salimos el sabado por la tarde.

Como dice mi marido el trato por encima del diez .Todos los profesionales que nos atendieron con una sonrisa en la cara con cariño y siempre atentos y podemos decir como no es un hotel de 5 estrellas pues , todo y así la gente ves que le sale de dentro.

Pero hay uno que merece mi puntuación más alta, el hotel The Serras. Desde que pisas la recepción hasta que finalizas en su terraza, todo es perfecto. Amén del personal que tienen, siempre atentos a que no te falte de nada. Las habitaciones preciosas, y con una decoración digna de premio. Y la terraza, las vistas a nuestro ""moll de la fusta"" son insuperables. Vaya, yo que me he recorrido muchas terrazas de los hoteles de Barcelona, os aseguro que es la mejor que he visto.

18,Vom Anfang bis zum Schluss perfekt!,"Ein super Hotel an bester Lage in der Nähe des Hafens. Das Hotel überzeugt mit einem perfekten Service. Nach einem herzlichen und sehr informativen Check- in (mit Champagner oder Getränk nach Wahl) wird einem alles über das Haus und auf Wunsch über die Stadt erklärt. Anschliessend folgt eine Hausführung mit Zimmerbegehung. Als Überraschung wartet dort ein gekühlter Cava mit Snacks als kleine Aufmerksamkeit. Es geben sich alle sehr grosse Mühe damit man sich als Gast willkommen und bestens aufgehoben fühlt. Die Zimmer und das Hotel allgemein ist sehr hochwertig und edel ausgestattet. Wir hatten eine Junior Suite mit seitlichem Blick/Hof. Dank Doppelverglasung (extra zwei Fenster) ist es absolut ruhig und nichts von der Strasse und den Personen auf den Gassen zu hören. Minibar-Ausstattung ist sehr umfangreich. 
Frühstücksbuffet war gut, hebt sich aber nicht gegenüber anderen 5 Sterne Hotels ab was die Auswahl und Qualität angeht. Aber auch hier eine sehr aufgestellte und freundliche Bedienung und tolle Atmosphäre. Die Rooftop-Bar auf dem Dach bietet eine super Aussicht auf den Hafen und hat einen kleinen, nicht beheizten Pool. Es werden dort sehr feine Drinks serviert. Dieses Boutique Hotel bleibt uns in bester Erinnerung und wir würden es sofort wieder buchen.",5,2016,11,18

18,Sehr zu empfehlen.,"Nun zweimal hier gewesen. Absolut phantastisch. Small Boutique Hotel. Teuer, aber nur zu empfehlen.  Sehr sauber. Qualifiziertes, sehr freundliches Personal.  Wunderbare Zimmer.  Die Bäder sind  kaum zu übertreffen. Dachterasse klein , aber auch absolut okay.  Sehr gutes Frühstück. Kommen wieder. Auf dem Niveau wie das ""Casa de la Poeta"" in Sevilla.

18,"Toller Blick, tolles Hotel","Wir haben spontan für ein Wochenende Barcelona gebucht. Unsere Wahl fiel auf dieses Hotel: Das Hotel  liegt am südlichen Ende des Bari Gothic, also direkt am historischen Hafen. Es ist absolut kein Standard-Hotel, das sieht man bereits an der hochwertigen und edlen Einrichtung. Besonders gefallen hat uns die individuelle Einrichtung in allen Bereichen.  Das Personal ist sehr zuvorkommend und serviceorientiert und alle waren sehr freundlich. Auch die Frage nach einem anderen Kopfkissen wurde sofort erfüllt.  Die Roof Top Bar ist ein HIghlight am frühen und späten Abend. Bei einem traumhaften Ausblick kann man hier den Abend beginnen oder Enden lassen.
Für einen Citytrip können wir das Hotel empfehlen.",5,2016,06,26
18,Magnifico servicio e instalaciones!,El servicio ha sido impecable y las habitaciones magníficas. La localización es inmejorable y también el restaurante del hotel.

Ein klasse Restaurant  dabei und dazu eine Sonnenterasse mit dem besten Ausblick auf den Hafen im 7 Stock oben mit kleinem Schwimmbad -)) ein Traum",5,2016,05,17
18,Sehr schönes Stadthotel mit Verbesserungspotential,"Wir waren 4 Nächte im The Serras und haben während dieser Zeit sowohl sehr positive leider aber auch ein paar negative Erfahrungen gemacht. 

Das Gute zuerst. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral und alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind entweder zu Fuss oder mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel sehr gut erreichbar. Obwohl das Hotel an der verkehrsreichen Passeig de Colom liegt, sind die Zimmer sehr ruhig, sofern die Fenster geschlossen sind. Der Empfang und das Check-in war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Wir fühlten uns vom ersten Augenblick sehr willkommen. Beim Check-in wurden wir gefragt ob wir als Willkommensdrink einen Cava (Spanischer Schaumwein) möchten, was wir sehr geschätzt haben. Auch wurden wir gefragt, ob wir im Hotel das Nachtessen einnehmen möchten und eine Tischreservation vornehmen möchten. Da das Restaurant sehr gut besucht ist und wir zu viert waren, konnten wir erst an unserem letzten Abend dort essen. Dazu mehr weiter unten. Während wir auf das Zimmer warteten, genossen wir die herrliche Aussicht von der Dachterrasse und haben ein paar Tapas gegessen. Diese waren ausgezeichnet. Da wir noch keine Zimmernummer hatten, haben wir die Rechnung bar bezahlt. Leider mussten wir feststellen, dass uns Tapas im Betrag von Euro 29 verrechnet wurden, welche wir weder bestellt noch gegessen hatten. Als wir die Servicefachfrau auf den Fehler aufmerksam gemacht haben, hat sie sich entschuldigt und die Rechnung wurde korrigiert. Fehler können passieren – Kontrolle wäre besser. 

Das Zimmer war pünktlich um 14:00 bezugsbereit. Die Zimmer sind sehr geräumig und hell. Die Einrichtung ist modern. Die Betten sind sehr bequem. Alles war tadellos sauber. Die Zimmer werden zweimal pro Tag gereinigt und mit frischen Handtücher ausgestattet. Als Begrüssung hatten wir eine Flasche Cava auf dem Zimmer. Eine sehr nette Aufmerksamkeit. 

Da wir für die ersten drei Nächte nicht im Hotel essen konnten, fragten wir an der Rezeption ob sie uns Restaurants empfehlen können und eine Reservation für uns vornehmen könnten. Dies wurde gemacht und es wurden uns ein paar Restaurants zu Auswahl empfohlen. Obwohl wir alle Tischreservation auf 20:00 gewünscht haben, wurde in einem Restaurant die Reservation auf 21:30 gemacht ohne uns darüber zu informieren. Vor Ort im Restaurant und mit viel Goodwill konnte uns zum Glück dann doch noch einen Tisch zugewiesen werden. 

Am letzten Abend im Hotel Restaurant „Informal“ konnten wir die vom Hotelzimmer offerierte Cava Flasche anstandslos zum Apéro mitbringen und trinken. Auch hatten wir einen zusätzlichen Gutschein für eine Flasche Rotwein erhalten. Auch dies eine sehr nette Aufmerksamkeit. Wir bestellten Vor- und Hauptspeise. Als Hauptgang das „Charcoal grilled T-Bone Steak“ aus Galicia. Wir bestellten das Fleisch medium. Leider kam das Fleisch blutig und wir mussten es zurückschicken nachdem es bereits tranchiert war. Auch habe ich die Servicefachfrau darauf aufmerksam gemacht, dass das Stück Fleisch kein T-Bone Steak sei sondern lediglich ein Beef Chop. Ich wurde dann belehrt, dass dies die spanische Version eines T-Bone Steak sei. Als ich sie korrigiert habe und ihr erklärt habe, was ein T-Bone Steak ist, hat sie es mit dem Chef de Service besprochen. Als der Chef de Service zu uns an den Tisch kam, hat er mir belehrend die gleiche Antwort gegeben, dass die Spanier das Fleisch anders schneiden als in Deutschland. Ich habe ihn dann darauf hingewiesen, dass ein T-Bone wie auf der englischen Version der Karte erwähnt ein internationaler Begriff sei und es sich dabei um ein Porterhouse Steak handelt mit dem Tenderloin (oder Filet) und dem Strip Steak. Wir hatten lediglich das Strip Steak erhalten, das Filet fehlte. Die belehrende Art des Chef de Service war eher peinlich und für ein 5-Sterne Hotel mit internationaler Kundschaft unangebracht. Ich würde dem Hotel empfehlen die Speisekarte entsprechend anzupassen und sich zu erkundigen was ein T-Bone ist. 

Zusammenfassend würde ich sagen, dass das Hotel top ist, die Mitarbeitenden sehr freundlich sind es jedoch für ein Hotel dieser Preisklasse deutliches Verbesserungspotential im Service und bei der Kontrolle gibt.",4,2016,05,10

18,Un magnifico hotel boutique e inmejoreble servicio,"Es un hotel pequeño,por lo que la estancia es muy personalizada y rapidamente todos los empleados te conocen.

Las habitaciones destacan por la calidad de sus colchones. almohadas y toallas.
El desayuno puede ser buffet y al mismo tiempo platos calientes servidos en la mesa.Todo de muy buena calidad.
El restaurante es pequeño,por lo que convine reservar,pues esta muy solicitado por clientes no alojados en el hotel.
La terraza tiene impresionantes vistas.
En el edificio que hoy ocupa el hotel tuvo uno de sus primeros estudios Pablo Picasso de joven,y en el pinto el lienzo titulado:PRIMERA COMUNION,que podeis ver en el museo de la ciudad de Barcelona.
Su situacion frente al puerto le da una magnifica situacion dentro de la ciudad,pero muy tranquilo de noche,sin ruidos de la calle,tambien gracias a las dobles ventanas que lo insonorizan.

Rimane il mio Hotel preferito perché la cura del cliente, l'ambiente di classe e soprattutto il ristorante informal lo rendono unico. Tutto il personale e' stato fantastico ed ho apprezzato molto la professionalità e la gentilezza dei giovani direttori che ho conosciuto durante il mio soggiorno. Sicuramente ritornerò ",5,2016,01,25
18,La gran sorpresa del 2015,"Un hotel que abrió generando expectativas pero siempre con distinción. Habitaciones impecables, amplias, bien situado, trato inmejorable y un rooftop de alucine.

18,5 stelle tutte meritate,"Ho soggiornato con mia moglie in questo Hotel il 4 e 5 gennaio ed è stato tutto perfetto dall'accoglienza al check in al saluto al check out quando abbiamo conosciuto anche  il general manager Antonio che ha davvero una marcia in più come l'hotel che ha qualcosa in più di un normale 5 stelle . Sono molto curati i dettagli, l'albergo non è appariscente ma è molto raffinato. Dalla colazione alla carta ed il modo elegante in cui viene servita alla biancheria in camera. Al primi piano un library bar con pubblicazioni ricercate ed interessanti, tra i libri anche un vaso colmo di caramelle a disposizione degli ospiti. Confortevole la camera con una doccia all'altezza ed ottimo il servizio in tutti i reparti. Lo consiglio e tornerò certamente ... sperando di trovare posto perchè l'albergo è nuovo ma avrà certamente un gran successo",5,2016,01,05
18,Chicchissimo con piccolissime imperfezioni.,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel boutique per 3 gg in occasione del fine anno.Cose positive: il personale , dal direttore ai camerieri passando per la reception e' professionalmente di livello altissimo ed anche simpatico, il che non guasta. Il bar e'dotato di prodotti di altissimo livello e anche qui i cocktails sono perfetti e il barman ancora di piu'; la colazione e'elegantissima , curatissima con seleIone di formaggi , di prosciutti, salami , due-tre tipi di sandwiches al salmone e al prosciutto con formaggio,succhi buonissimi e particolari , brioches di vari tipi e ancora pasticcini e piccole tortine squisiti.Poi i piatti caldi e le macedonie. Sinceramente quando la qualita'e'cosi alta e l'eleganza non e'vistosa ma raffinata si sta benissimo.Il mix e'uguale anche a cena dove abbiamo mangiato paella di pesce, polipo,filetto con fegato e dolci.Qui il rapporto qualita'-prezzo e'molto buono e non si sgarra con il servizio.Veniamo alla camera : mi avevano detto al momento della prenotazione che era l'ultima e aveva la vista sul dietro e in effetti la stanza e'un po'piccolina ma quando siamo arrivati abbiamo trovato salsiccine , cantucci e cioccolato e ogni sera un dolce differente; in piu'macchina con cialde per caffe'molto buono.Letto fantastico ; in dotazione nella stanza anche kit dell'amore per lei e lui. Piccole imperfezioni : idromassaggio non funzionante anche con vasca piena e palestrina molto ina . Elegantissima la sala aperitivi lettura al primo piano e il bar sul tetto con piscina.Bravi tutti !",5,2016,01,02
18,Top,L'albergo è un gioiellino. Posizione perfetta. Al centro ma fuori dal trambusto. Il personale è gentilissimo. Le camere moderne e confortevoli. I dolcini che trovavamo la sera in camera ottimi. Tutto curato nei particolari. Colazione top!!!! ,5,2016,01,02
18,Experiencia única,"Hotel con mucho encanto. Servicio exquisito, detalles cuidados. Merece la pena cenar en su restaurante con DJ en directo. El aparcamiento fuera del hotel es un pequeño inconveniente. Camas increíbles, ropa de cama y baño excelente. Una opción muy recomendable.",5,2015,12,27
18,No hay palabras,"Comentar varios detalles brevemente que hacen de este emplazamiento la mejor opción en Barcelona.
Las camas: Es prácticamente imposible encontrar camas con mejores características.
El desayuno: El desayuno es increíble, variado, delicioso, con todo tipo de detalles y posibilidades... 
Recibimiento y atención personal: Trato exquisito, en todo momento antes y durante la estancia. Si hay oportunidad de cenar, quieres repetir.

Habitaciones luminosas con buena vista al puerto de Barcelona y a los veleros, muy acogedoras. 
Espectacular terraza con piscina y bar que es un auténtico lujo en la Ciudad.
Espléndido restaurante, merecedor de una estrella, donde bajo el asesoramiento de Marc Gascons, Ofrece una carta de gran nivel gaztronómico. Para disfrutar!",5,2015,11,15
18,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel mit sehr freundlichem Service,"Das Hotel ist überschaubar und liegt am südlichen Ende des Bari Gothic direkt am alten Hafen. Es ist sehr edel und individuell eingerichtet. Der Empfang und der Service sind äusserst freundlich und herzlich. Das Essen im Restaurant ist sehr gut. Die Roof Top Bar lädt mit schönes Sicht über den Hafen zum Verweilen ein, bevor man den Abend beginnt. Sehr empfehlenswert.",5,2015,11,09
18,Weekend fantastic ,"Se cercate un hotel di design e accogliente  il the Serras è  quello che fa per voi. Posizione  ottima fra la Marina è il centro storico,personale professionale e molto cordiale. Camere moderne, eleganti e spaziose, ma quello che mi ha maggiormente colpito è  nella cure dei dettagli che a mio avviso spesso fanno la differenza. Terrazza con vista mare perfetta.",5,2015,09,28
18,Echte  Bereicherung für die Hotelszene in BCN!,"Das Serras ist so chic eingerichtet, dass man am liebsten gleich den Interior Designer für die eigene Home Decoration verpflichten möchte. Wenngleich natürlich gelbe Teppichböden auf den Fluren sicherlich schon bald ein wenig ""eingelaufen"" aussehen werden. Das Personal ist an Freundlichkeit nicht zu überbieten. Das Frühstück ebenfalls ein Gedicht. Die Rooftop Terrasse ein Ort der Entspannung, wenngleich der Pool wirklich XS ist. Das Hotel ist extrem stark gebucht, insofern gab's leider keinen Complimentary Late Check-out für uns, aber dafür konnten wir auf der Dachterrasse noch ein wenig chillen. Das Hotel Wifi im Zimmer war recht langsam. Aber das einzige echte Manko im The Serras ist das völlige Fehlen jeglicher Klobürsten, dafür sollte das Geld schon noch reichen hoffe ich - erst dann ist die Ausstattung im The Serras wirklich komplett!",5,2015,09,27
18,Cocktail e relax,"Location semplicemente spettacolare, piccolo intimo e molto curato. Siamo stati nella terrazza rilassante e intima. Servizio davvero a 5 stelle, con particolare menzione ai cocktail straordinari del capo barman Albert. Sono un conoscitore di drink e posso dire che la qualità era eccelsa. Consigliatissimo!",5,2015,08,20
18,Unico,"Después de nuestro ultimo viaje a barcelona, nos acordabamos de esta pequeña joya como un lugar de encanto.
Bien, admito que es un hotel con un servicio espectacular, un desayuno altísima calidad y un restaurante de pescado entre los 3 mejores de catalunya para mi.
Cuando hemos reservado ya nos habían indicado que habíamos estado en el hotel y que nos gustaba la hab 402. sorprendidos y ilusionados hemos hecho el Check in y por supuesto que nos han puesto en nuestra habitación favorita. La rooftop es un encanto, una noche había un pequeño desfile, música live y un menú exclusivo excelente!!",5,2015,08,12
18,Sorprendido y Impresionado.,"Nuestro hijo nos había regalado 1 noche en este hotel para nuestro 30 aniversario de boda. El había ido a cenar y nos dijo que era verdaderamente excelente.  
Nosotros vamos siempre al Mandarin Oriental o al Arts cuando viajamos a Barcelona y no estábamos muy seguros de este nuevo Hotel. Fue todo un éxito. Desde la bienvenida hasta la salida pasando por la habitación, muy amplia, cómoda, lujosa y llena de detalles  y el desayuno que con un precio mucho mas correcto que otros hoteles tienen muchos productos orgánicos, fruta fresca de altísima calidad y los huevos son excelentes. Íbamos con unas expectativas muy altas para la cena y no nos defraudo. La calidad de la comida de un nivel de estrella Michelin y el servicio excepcional. Muchas gracias! Regresaremos muy pronto.",5,2015,08,07
18,Fantastico recuerdo,"Pasamos nuestra luna de miel en el hotel este mes de mayo y las estancia fue fantastica. El hotel es acogedor y esta fantasticamente ubicado, en primera linea de mar. Las habitaciones, modernas y elegantes, reseñar la comodidad de la cama king size (como dormir en las nubes!). La terraza tiene un ambiente unico: las vistas del mar y el skyline del puerto acompañadas de un coctel son un cierre de tarde magico. Marc Gascons le pone el broche final con una carta exquisita para degustar en el interior o en la terraza a pie de calle. Una visita obligada para hacer un descanso en la magica ciudad de Barcelona",5,2015,07,30
18,Altamente recomendable,"El Hotel The Serras es altamente recomendable para todos aquellos que disfrutan de un buen servicio. Puede presumir de tener todas las cualidades que hacen que sea una estancia de 10. 
Su ubicación es inmejorable, su decoración hace que sea muy acogedor, la cama es comodísima, las vistas desde la terraza son espectaculares (¡y sus mojitos también!), y además, su restaurante Informal hace las delicias de muchos sibaritas. Destaco además el desayuno, original, y muy bueno.
¡Lo recomiendo al 100%!",5,2015,07,23

Restaurante exquisito y con una atencion al cliente impecable.",5,2015,07,10
18,Increible!!!,Este hotel es increible. Hemos tenido la suerte de quedarnos 2 noches en la junior suite. No nos gusta hacer trip advisor pero no podemos no compartir la mejor experiencia de boutique hotel en europa. El servicio fabulous!!! Quieren que este bien 24horas al dia. Espero que abren uno en caracas para ir cada dia!!! Gracias The Serras,5,2015,07,09
18,Angenehmes Hotel in der Altstadt,"Dieses Hotel ist ohne Bedenken zu empfehlen in der etwas gehobenen Preisklasse. Es liegt nahe am Hafen und man ist gleich in der Altstadt von Barcelona. Die Zimmer sind geräumig, sehr sauber und ruhig. Die meisten verfügen über ein kleines Balkon. Das Badezimmer ist top und sehr angenehm mit seiner getrennten Dusche. Das Personal ist überaus freundlich und hilfsbereit. Das Frühstück ist preisleistungsmässig ok und sehr variabel, Preis 20 Euro Aufschlag. Das Hotel hat eine kleine Dachterasse mit Bar und einem sehr kleinen Swimmingpool mit einigen Liegestühlen. Die Buchungen sind insgesamt in der Altstadt etwas billiger wenn man an Ort und Stelle bucht durch fragen nach einem Discount. Viele Hotels sind laut Booking Com ausgebucht und haben trotzdem noch Zimmer frei. Barcelona hat viel Sehenswertes. Eine Sight Seeing Fahrt mit den Bussen ist zu empfehlen, da von diesem Hotel in wenig Zeit zu erreichen. Infos kann man gerne in der Rezeption erhalten. Was uns störte ist der Preisaufschlag von 100 Euro pro Nacht die gleich bei Ankunft auf die provisorische Rechnung gesetzt wurden, um bei der Abbuchung mit den anfallenden Kosten zurückerstattet werden.",4,2015,07,05
18,Excellente,"Este hotel es increible, un servicio y un trato personal inmejorable, habitaciones estupendas y de buen tamano, el restaurante de alto nivel y el desayuno de muy alta calidad a un precio correcto. La vista de la terraza hace todo mágico y excepcional!!!",5,2015,06,20
18,Tolle Rooftop Bar in BCN,"Die Terrasse dieses 5* Hotels ist mega mit top Aussicht über den Hafen! Haben zwar für einen Aperol-Spritz 15€ gezahlt, war es aber wert. Das Publikum war sehr gut gekleidet (Hemd, usw.), aber die Atmosphäre war sehr entspannt, die Musik gut,...",5,2015,06,15
18,Spitzenhotel im Zentrum Barcelonas,"Das Hotel ist von außen sehr unscheinbar, aber von innen... Die Begrüßung war sehr herzlich, wir erhielten ein Glas Cava, dann wurden wir herumgeführt und am Zimmer erwartete uns ein Willkommensgruß (Obstkorb, 1 Flasche Sekt und eine persönlich geschriebene Willkommensnachricht). Die Zimmer sind sehr schön und stilvoll eingerichtet, die Matratzen des Bettes sehr angenehm - nicht zu hart und nicht zu weich, ebenso sind die Kissen richtig bequem. Das Bad ist großzügig und es gibt viele Kleinigkeiten, die den Aufenthalt zu etwas besonderem machen (es gab jeden Abend ein Betthupferl in Form von selbstgemachten Keksen und Küchlein). Die Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich und aufmerksam, ohne aufdringlich zu wirken. Man kommt sich sehr willkommen und persönlich betreut vor. Wir haben die Bar auf der Terrasse ausprobiert, die Cocktails sind sehr lecker und das Ambiente wirklich schön, ebenso wie der Ausblick auf den Hafen von Barcelona. Es gibt auch einen kleinen Pool, den haben wir aber nicht probiert.
Die Lage ist super - direkt am Hafen und am Eingang zur Fußgängerzone Bart Gotik.",5,2015,06,14
18,"für eine besondere Gelegenheit, 10+","Das Hotel, sah schon auf den Bildern wunderschön aus, die Lage, kaum zu toppen und vor Ort folgte eine Ueberraschung der Anderen. 

Zimmer war Top, sauber und sehr geschmackvoll möbliert, Aufmerksamkeit des Hauses (anlässlich unseres 5 Hochzeittages und des nachgefeierten 40en Geburtstags) prickelnd und passend. Guetsrelations-Mitarbeiterinnen und Hotelleitung, sowie auch Kellner, Roomservice-Angestellte allesamt zuvorkommend und freundlich. Das Hoteleigene Restaurant El-Informal konnte mit hervorragender Qualität überzeugen. 

Einzig ein kleiner Nachtrag, die wunderschöne Dachterrasse sollte den Hotelgästen immer zugänglich sein (eines Abends wegen ""geschlossener Gesellschaft"" leider nicht möglich). Für uns aber eine klare 10+!!!!",5,2015,06,11
18,Tutto perfetto,"Nuovo hotel in posizione strategica - stile e arredo moderno - camere spaziose, complete di tutto ciò che serve - personale gentilissimo e con massima disponibilità - colazione ottima - buon prezzo - terrazza con vista sul porto: prendere un drink di sera è bellissimo; avevo soggiornato a Barcellona in molti hotel diversi - d'ora in poi questo sarà per me quello di riferimento - bravi: tutto perfetto ",5,2015,05,27
18,6 Estrellas,"Hotel excelente en una posición estratégica para descubrir la ciudad, la Jsuite de diseño con toque de historia. Servicio impresionante y lo que hace la diferencia son todos los pequeños toques 6 estrellas, nota de bienvenida manuscrita con fruta, carta de almohada y carta de masajes fantástica, pequeño postre que te espera en tu mesita de noche... todo genial! Volveremos",5,2015,05,24
18,"Fantástico restaurante, no te lo puedes perder!","Restaurante más que recomendable! Estuvimos cenando en El Informal con un grupo de amigos y la experiencia fue muy buena. El ambiente del restaurante es muy agradable, la decoración preciosa y el DJ que tienen de fondo un acierto total. El servicio es un 10 y ni hay detalle que se les pase. La carta es un acierto, es una de estas cartas en las que te cuesta elegir porque lo querrías probar todo. Destacaría las patatas bravas (que hacen a su manera), las croquetas, los ñoquis, las sardinas fritas, los pescados y el risoto. La calidad de la comida excelente. No dejéis de probar los postres! Muy recomendables también.
Aconsejo tomar un cocktail en el bar del hotel antes o después de la cena. Vale la pena probar el cocktail picasso.

En resumen, una experiencia muy buena en Barcelona que sin duda recomiendo. Repetiremos!",5,2015,05,08

Desde que entramos, el personal nos trató estupendamente pero lo que realmente nos sorprendió fue el restaurante, sin duda lo recomendaré.",5,2015,04,19
18,ECCELLENTE SCOPERTA,"Abbiamo soggiornato durante le vacanze pasquali in questa nuovissima struttura (inaugurata lo scorso gennaio). L'hotel è accogliente, raccolto (solo 28 stanze)ed  è situato in una posizione strategica. Il direttore, Antonio, é giovane ma decisamente alla altezza di guidare una struttura di questo livello, il resto dello staff è giovanissimo, sorridente (cosa non sempre scontata) e disponibile.... Bravi ragazzi! Le stanze sono spaziose, pulitissime ed arredate modernamente e funzionali. Da segnalare il roof garden dove sorseggiare un drink e godersi il panorama suggestivo del porto. 
La piscina è più che altro coreografica, date le dimensioni modeste, non certo per grandi nuotate. 
Assolutamente da consigliare. 
Franco&Marina ",5,2015,04,06
18,EXCELENTE,"Una ubicación excelente muy cerca de varios lugares clave (puerto, Maremágnum, Via Laietana, casco antiguo y su zona de bares. El servicio del hotel a los detalles es excepcional. Un 10 sobre 10. Por su excelente ubicación es muy recomendable.",5,2015,04,05
18,Gran descubrimiento en Barcelona ,"Encontramos este nuevo hotel en Barcelona, y fue realmente excelente, tanto su ubicación, habitaciones, bar 24 horas, restaurante delicioso, etc.

18,Fantastico,"Ho pernottato 3 notti con la mia compagna in questo meraviglioso hotel boutique molto curato in tutti i dettagli e situato nel centro di Barcellona. Al mio arrivo il personale ci ha offerto un aperitivo dopo ci hanno accompagnato nella nostra stupenda camera 305 deluxe con vista sul barrio Gotico. Una sera abbiamo cenato nel ristorante interno,particolarmente buoni gli gnocchi al tartufo e l'immancabile crema catalana. Al ritorno dal nostro tour ci rilassavamo gustando un ottimo cocktail sulla terrazza con vista mare che si trova al 6 piano. Sicuramente ritornerò in questa splendida città e pernotterò nuovamente al The Serras.",5,2015,03,29

Gracias",4,2015,03,29
18,Un vero Boutique Hotel!,"Io e mio marito abbiamo soggiornato per la nostra breve luna di miele, in questo nuovissimo hotel e devo dire che la scelta è stata ottima.
In breve posso dire che è un albergo che merita una visita specialmente se si è amanti del design e della buona cucina ma anche per l'ottima posizione nel centro di Barcellona e per l'estrema attenzione data a tutti gli ospiti.
Il bello di un boutique hotel è che le stanze (e quindi gli ospiti) sono poche e quindi ti senti ""coccolato"" da tutti.
L'albergo è nuovissimo e per questo motivo non era ancora stato aperto il bar situato sulla terrazza panoramica che era molto scenografico visto che ci si trova fronte mare...ma visto che in tre giorni volevamo vedere quello che si vede normalmente in una settimana non ne avremmo comunque avuto il tempo. Appena arrivati ci hanno comunicato che ci davano una junior suite al posto della camera da noi scelta senza aumentarci il prezzo visto che eravamo in luna di miele...e nel mentre ci hanno offerto un bicchiere di cava che è il loro champagne. Camera bellissima (anche se sul lato strada), bagno con idromassaggio, doccia enorme, letto king size comodissimo, tv con canali satellitari...e mentre ci sistemiamo ci bussano e ci offrono una bottiglia di champagne. Tutto il personale è gentilissimo e super attento alle necessità degli ospiti..noi avevamo la colazione compresa e devo dire che è tutto superlativo visto che il ristorante interno ha una stella Michelin e le brioche e le dolcezze della colazione le fanno tutte in casa. Unico neo, se posso fare un appunto, è che molte pietanze sono da scegliere alla carta (tipo omelette o crêpes) visto che c'è lo chef front cooking e purtroppo non si capisce se sono comprese nel prezzo che già è stato pagato per il b&b o se vanno pagate extra...ma sarebbe bastato chiedere da parte nostra o magari specificare da parte loro...Una sera abbiamo cenato in albergo e devo dire che è super. Servizio ottimo (bravissima la cameriera spagnola che ci parlava e consigliava parlandoci in Veneto!!) e cibo superlativo. Rapporto qualità prezzo buonissimo!! Volevamo cenare li anche la sera dopo ma purtroppo mi sono beccata una mezza influenza che mi ha impedito di terminare al meglio la vacanza...meno male che il check-out era entro le 12 del giorno dopo...se avremo la possibilità di tornare a Barcellona torneremo sicuramente al The Serras!",5,2015,03,25
18,EXCELENTE!!!,"Es difícil que coincida un servicio impecable con una inmejorable calidad de producto. Eso es lo que tiene el restaurant de este hotel. Recomiendo a quien quiera descubrir esta joya en Barcelona que lo haga: se está convirtiendo en el lugar ""in"" donde siempre coincidirás con gente importante.",5,2015,03,19
18,Un'esperienza Eccezionale!,"Complimenti al The Serras
Un fantástico hotel che ci ha lasciato senza parole. Tutto il personale di una gentilezza e cortesia  incredible! Le ragazze alla reception belle e sopratutto simpatiche. La colazione ottima e la stanza incredibile! Abbiamo prenotato una junior suite 501, che aveva una vasca da bagno bellissima vista mare e molto probabilmente il letto più comodo dove ho mai dormito!!!! Ritorneremo questa estate senza alcun dubbio, Grazie.",5,2015,03,16
18,Excelente,"Ubicación novedosa. Vistas desde terraza únicas. Trato exquisito. Hotel boutique especial y de verdad en Barcelona, probablemente único de estas características.

Desde el momento que llegamos con el taxi hasta que nos fuimos todo fue espectacular. La chica en recepcion que nos atendio fue muy amable y ademas nos recomendo un restaurante para ir a cenar que nos encanto. La habitacion es muy bonita, de diseño y muy calida. Dormimos genial, la cama muy comoda, se nota que hace poco que abrieron y fue como estrenarla. 
Al dia siguiente decidimos quedarnos a comer en el hotel. El restaurante estaba lleno pero el metre muy amable nos encontro una mesa. Que pena no haber estado mas dias para repetir, restaurante buenisimo.  Recomiendo el rodaballo a la brasa, exquisito!",5,2015,03,08
18,EL HOTEL DE TUS SUEÑOS,"Te gustaria que cuando entras en un hotel te abrieran la puerta con una gran sonrisa, entrar en un espacio acogedor, elegante, comodo, funcional, con una recepcion sin barreras, que estuviera situado en un barrio emblematico de barcelona como es el paseo Colon,  que tuviera una terraza con unas vistas espectaculares del puerto, de cara al mar, y con un restaurante gastronomico muy cuidado donde el xef te ofrece sus mejores creaciones

18,Noche en el hotel,"Un hotel excelente, se nota el gusto y el cariño con el que aplican  las nuevas tendencias y materiales de obra y decoración, cuando fuimos apenas llevaba 3 semanas abierto, de hecho aún olía a nuevo!!
El servicio excelente, digno de las estrellas que luce.
Lo único malo fue que estaba nublado y no pudimos disfrutar mucho de la terraza.
En general una gran sensación y gran hotel. 100% recomendable.",5,2015,02,25
18,¡Elección Sublime!,"Descubrí este pequeño y encantador hotel tras leer un artículo en La Vanguardia on-line. Me llamo la atención que fuera un antiguo taller de Picasso, cosa que encontré muy interesante. A las pocas semanas tenía programado un viaje a Barcelona, así que decidí apostar por probar allí un fin de semana con mi pareja.  "" Nos encantó"". 
Las habitaciones son perfectas, una decoración moderna pero respetando el aire del edificio, amenities de lujo y tanto los muebles, tv y baño de gran calidad. Hacía tiempo que no encontraba esto en un hotel. 

Lo más sorprendente para nosotros fue el resturante llamado Informal. Fuimos a picar algo en la terraza y al ver la carta decidimos quedarnos. Una elección que nos nos defraudó. Todo buenisimo, desde platillos para compartir hasta segundos platos, pasando por unos postres increíbles...para chuparse los dedos...
Nos sorprendió mucho, ya que mi pareja y yo ( que somos bastante sibaritas) no solemos comer en los restutrantes de hoteles, pero en este sin duda repetiremos cuando volvamos a Barcelona. Sino recuero mal el chef tiene una estrella Michelín.",5,2015,02,25

Nur im Bad fehlten die Tissues :). Aber vielleicht kommen die noch, das Hotel war erst 2 Wochen offen.",5,2015,02,16
18,Gran hotel,"""The Serras"" hace poco que ha abierto y me pareció espectacular. Es un hotel de pocas habitaciones, trato personalizado y en el que el equipo es muy profesional y cuida cada detalle. 

Su ubicación y sus excelentes vistas lo hace más atractivo. En la terraza de arriba puedes tomar algo y relajarte mirando al mar, es increíble!

Muy recomendable el restaurante, el chef es Marc Gascons, con una estrella Michelin. Está buenísimo y puedes ver la cocina desde el restaurante a través de un cristal!

Lo recomendaré y seguro que volveré! Me llevo muy buen recuerdo.",5,2015,02,02

18,The Serras y olé!! ,"Descubrimos este hotel por un articulo en la vanguardia y nos atrajo mucho el concepto de hotel que proponian asi que decidimos reservar aprovechando la tarifa de apertura que encontramos.
La bienvenida es muy profesional y calida, el equipo te recibe con una sonrisa sincera y desde el primer momento te sientes como en casa. Es muy bonito el diseño del mobiliario y las calidades son excelentes, cabe destacar la insonorización del dormitorio, que se aprecia nada mas entrar al cerrar la puerta. 
La habitacion 301 es muy acogedora y goza de unas vistas privilegiadas sobre el mar. Equipada con todo lo necesario y esperado en un cinco estrellas, con un toque muy personal y distinguido. El minibar ademas de lo tipico ofrece champagne de calidad y un surtido de snacks y chocolates de primera, daban ganas de comerselo todo. Autenticos los caramelos artesanos que ofrecen!! 
Nada que ver con lo que te encuentras en una habitacion de hotel de cadena...
Hemos disfrutado de una cena compartiendo varios platos y todos nos han gustado mucho, entre los que destacaré el tataki de salmon, los gnocchis con trufa, albondigas con guisantes y el espectacular postre de gin tonic, conseguidisimo el sabor, muy refrescante y sin pecar de dulce, en su punto justo, Chapeau!! al equipo de cocina. Aprovechamos a sentarnos en una mesa con vistas a la cocina, de lujo, muy interesante ver como elaboran los platos. Habia varias mesas cenando a la vez y el servicio era agil y profesional, no tuvimos esperas entre platos y la atención siempre fue profesional y muy amena.
Sin duda repetiremos, tanto el restaurante el Informal como la estancia, es un lugar especial y lo vale.

18,Hotel perfecto para estancias de trabajo,"Estuve en Barcelona 3 días de reuniones y quería un hotel acogedor donde sentirme cómodo y poder descansar tras las largas jornadas de trabajo. 
Mi office manager reservó en este hotel y la verdad es que fue todo un acierto. He estado en muchos hoteles en Barcelona para estancias de trabajo y este es el que mejor impresión me he llevado. 
El hotel está impecable, con todas las comodidades que puedas necesitar (céntrico, buen servicio, recogida en el aeropuerto, wi-fi, etc.) y cuidado al máximo detalle.
La próxima vez que tenga que volver a Barcelona repetiré. El servicio es muy amable, uno se siente como en casa, y eso es impagable. 
p.d: para desconectar, nada mejor que pasarse por la terraza. Es espectacular...",5,2015,01,28
18,Excelente ,"Paseando por paseo Colón nos encontramos con esta maravilla, no tiene un gran cartel en el que se anuncie que es un hotel, pues el lujo discreto es su mayor encanto, pero lo vimos de casualidad y al ya saber de su apertura por La Vanguardia, no quisimos perder la ocasión de conocerlo. La verdad es que tan sólo tomamos una cerveza y un aperitivo pero he de decir que estuvimos genial. El trato fue excelente y el hotel precioso, digno de ver. Estuvimos en la terraza por lo que el sol y las vistas al Port Vell hicieron lo demás. Altamente recomendable y decir, que en nuestra próxima visita a Bcn, trataremos de hospedarnos en él.",5,2015,01,25
