245,Disgusting!,There’s no way this is a four-star hotel. This was probably the most disgusting hotel I’ve ever stayed at. It is way overpriced for the condition of the room. The bathroom was disgusting and the sheets and pillow cases were dirty. No power at the night stand along with broken USB. The only thing appreciated was the proximity to the airport.,1,2024,10,18
245,Poor Airport Shuttle Service,"The food and room were very good, but the Airport Shuttle service was horrible and unacceptable!  The vehicle could not open doors for loading baggage and insté and forced baggage into passenger seats and on the laps of passengers.  The  number of passengers which were pushed into seating areas exceded safety standards.  I’m very disappointed with such poor service, especially when I am a Radison rewards member!  I may re-think about my relationship with Radison.",3,2024,10,16
245,Lovely!,"Very friendly staff, clean and modern hotel with beautiful rooms. my room attendant was Romana and I had not one issue with my room, it felt very homely. it would have been great if the tv paired with apple devices as I couldn’t use the tv. more shampoos and conditioners! the body lotion is to die for. plenty of towels and hairdryer. able to control heat and AC too",5,2024,10,15
245,Excellent Service at Our Company Dinner!,"I recently attended a company dinner here, and I have to say, the service was fantastic! Our server, Omer, was incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed.

We loved the warm atmosphere and great banter. The food recommendations were spot on, too! Huge thanks to Omer for making our night special. Highly recommend this place!",5,2024,10,15
245,The best Dublin airport hotel.,Definitely the best Dublin airport hotel beside terminal and far superior to the other on site hotel and in my experience better value for money. Breakfast excellent and  car parking good value. very friendly and efficient staff.,5,2024,10,14
245,Exceptional service,"We had a wonderful
Dinner - Tim our server made the evening very special.  He was highly attentive - but not over bearing !! 
When we come back we will ask for Tim
as our waiter!
The hotel staff is first notch - the restaurant and bar/lounge serve great food and the bar carries anything we needed .  This is always were we stay in Dublin",5,2024,10,12
245,Clean Accommodations close to the airport,"Good pillows, clean sheets, nicely appointed bathroom. Expresso machine in preferred room. Good breakfast with lots of selection.  Friendly staff and reasonable parking rates at the hotel. 

Hotel was a good choice for a quick trip to the airport if your work or travel takes you away from Dublin.",5,2024,10,05
245,Perfect in every aspect,"Excellent location if you have airport business or travel plans.
Overall the hotel is very clean, staff are very welcoming and food quality is excellent.
I could. Ot recommend other hotel at or near Dublin airport but Radisson.
Well done guys",5,2024,10,04
245,Pre-airport stay,"Overnight stay before early-morning flight. Location perfect, close to airport, room clean and spacious and sound proof, shuttle bus provided to airport at 4:15am! ",4,2024,10,02
245,Great place to stay near the airport.,We stayed here on the way back to the states after driving around the southern half of Ireland. It is close to a petrol station and to the rental car depots. Shuttle service to the airport is quick and efficient. ,4,2024,09,27
245,Meeting,"There for a business meeting. Facilities were great and food fantastic 😋 Lovely to get proper coffee machine at lunchtime

Difficult to get parking though but understandable so close to the airport

Looking forward to our next meeting

Thanks",5,2024,09,26
245,Very average,Room was needing maintenance - razor sharp pieces of tile on the shower floor nearly cut my foot.  Expected a lot better,2,2024,09,24
245,Overpriced!,"The last stay in a 14 day trip.  This is the most overpriced hotel for what we got.  No breakfast, Room was not welcoming with vinyl Floors, instant coffee and cold showers!  At least the beds were comfortable before a long flight.  Will never come back",2,2024,09,24
245,Business Review,Avoid. Overpriced and terrible value for money. No way this is a 4-star hotel. I really can't believe the outrageous prices they charge for this hotel. It's a rip-off.,1,2024,09,23
245,Great hotel right next to Terminal 2,"Great place to stay before early flight out of Dublin.  Very clean with on site restaurant and bar.  Food is pretty good.  Walkable to terminal 2 or you can take the free hotel shuttle.  After a week driving around the Irish countryside, it was nice to drop off the rental car and relax before heading home to the US",4,2024,09,20
245,Great hotel,"Really lovely hotel. Immaculately clean, Raisa the cleaner was so lovely and the place was spotless. Food was beautiful with a good variety of fresh food and juices at breakfast and lunch buffet. And lovely evening meals in the restaurant with friendly staff; Enes is a fantastic, tentative and kind waiter and an asset to the hotel. The Burrata Salad with grilled chicken and sourdough bread was my favourite, very fresh and tasty. 
All the staff are friendly and helpful. Yensi on the desk is fab and sorted me with any additional water bottles, tea bags etc for my room and always helpful to answer and queries. Nice spacious room with a comfy bed, pillows supplied are of various comfort so I could select one that suited my needs and get a good sleep. Managed to arrive in Dublin for a weeks’ business trip and the weather has been glorious, so really enjoyed a walk to ALSAA gym every evening to use my complementary access to their facilities. I usually hate business trips but have really enjoyed this. My daily business was on site, the conference suites are great, and the outside garden an added bonus to relax during our breaks, and I love the decor of the downstairs ladies. Every where in the hotel was clean, tidy and with a welcoming, warm ambiance.. I love the little touches of sweets, cookies and fresh water dotted around in various places in the reception. The over head shower option in my room was a lovely treat every evening after the gym., it was like having a mini massage.
Thanks everyone for looking after me!",5,2024,09,18
245,Gross bathroom,"The room was nice, but the bathroom was really disgusting. 

It made me question if it was even clean. The bathtub was covered in rust and a piece of the faucet was broken off. The toilet was also being held together by duct tape.

Considering what I paid for two nights I would’ve expected better",2,2024,09,12
245,"Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport",The staff were friendly and professional. The room as spotless and comfortable. The breakfast was extremely tasty and fresh. Overall an exceptional experience. ,5,2024,09,11
245,"Thank you, Dublin!","Good service, nice shower, clean and cozy room.
I appreciated being able to get a room on short notice at 4:30am after arriving on a delayed flight.
Staff was kind and considerate, offering a wake up call so I wouldn't miss breakfast, and letting me know about the courtesy shuttle and nearby attractions.",5,2024,09,10
245,It’s hard to enjoy having your confirmed room downgraded,"Not much to enjoy about being downgraded from a twin bed room confirmed booking to a standard room sofa bed. Beware of Radisson Blu Dublin airport management approach to complaints re: the response to my first review  about unfair commercial practice and misleading commercial practice,  not sure why Radisson Blu Dublin airport would think I should have enjoyed this. Not sure if manager even read the review given the quality of the generic response. More surprised that they would think I would ever  return to experience more exceptionally poor service and a sofa bed and one chair.  Look at Radisson reviews on Trustpilot as bad service and room downgrade seems common practice.",1,2024,09,10
245,Beautiful Airport Stop…,"It was only an overnight stay, but this is a quite lovely, modern hotel
I had to leave early next morning, so am quite unable to describe all the facilities, but the staff were more than welcoming and the rooms were modern with an elegant luxury. Simply on the strength of the room, I would gladly stay here again, 
Many thanks to Javier for his welcome and kindness.",5,2024,09,09
245,Bedroom terrible - queen bed is a sofa bed,"Bedroom terrible, I specifically booked a superior 2 queen bed room at full price, 29 days in advance, as a Radissom member.  Instead of we were given one bed and a sofa bed with only one chair in room. Room was for my 81 year old aunt and niece aged 61. Really Radisson - a sofa bed?? If there was no 2 queen bed room then should have been clear on the Radisson Blu booking website and not accepted my in advance and on good faith booking. Sofa bed and queen bed are not the same.
The one star is for the most helpful and courteous shuttle driver, thank you.",1,2024,09,07
245,Safe and Comfortable Stay at Radison Hotel,"We had a great stay at the Radisson Hotel near the airport in Dublin,Ireland.

Room: The room was large and spacious, with a comfortable bed and pillows, and we enjoyed a lovely view from the window.

Safety: The hotel has good security measures in place, including well-lit areas, key card access to rooms, and attentive staff.
Walkability: The location is near to the airport and is very convenient for travelers, with a free shuttle to and from the airport and a bus stop just a 3-minute walk away, providing easy access to the city center (about a
40-50 minute ride). However, the return trip can take 55 minutes to an hour, depending on the bus, and the walk from the bus stop to the hotel is about 10 minutes.

The reception staff and shuttle drivers were exceptionally friendly and helpful, and the room service attendants were cheerful and attentive. Our only minor issue was that housekeeping only provided one tea cup instead of two each time our room was cleaned, but this was quickly resolved with a call. 

Hotel highlights: Great view, Quiet 

Overall, a comfortable stay with great service! 👍🏻👍🏻",4,2024,09,05
245,"Nearest airport hotel,spotless","First of all the hotel is really close from the Terminal 2,about 3minutes. Receptionist was very kind, immediate check in,room is spotless. Everything nice and clean. Recommended. I stayed overnight as I have a morning flight.You can sleep as long as you want and just walk in to the Terminal. Very handy.",5,2024,09,01
245,Quick sleepover due to an early flight...,Very handy for getting to the airport at an unreasonable hour!!  I didn't have time to use the bar or restaurant so can only comment on the room.,5,2024,08,29
245,Commendations to your Night Manager - Mr Ravi Guntur,"my wife and I stayed with you (once again) the night before departing Dublin to return home to USA.  while on the flight my wife realized that she had left her handbag/pocketbook in the hotel room.  of course an element of panic set in.  when we landed I made a call to the hotel – reception listened to my issue & undertook to contact the night manager.  in less than 15 minutes I had a call from Mr Ravi Guntur – he took all the particulars – but of course housekeeping was closed for the day by then.  next morning he phoned me again – and not just that – he also sent me an e.mail confirming the details.

to the top cats at Radisson, both Dublin & beyond, this gentleman went well over & beyond the call of duty – so I would like to highly commend him – thank you!

NMcD",5,2024,08,26
245,Quality,"The nesspresso machine needs instructions............................................................................................................ There is no in room menu, the qr it opens the booking page not a menu.",4,2024,08,26
245,Seamus at Collage,"We had diner at Collage at the Radisson in DUBLUN. Seamus was out server and not only was the food amazing. Seamus was very professional, very attentive and one of the most courteous professional server we have had the pleasure to meet. I highly recommend the restaurant and If u happen to be here ask for Seamus!!! He is an asset to this establishment!",5,2024,08,24
245,Cancelled Flight-Room-Food,We stayed here after our flight was cancelled in a premium room. It was very clean and comfortable. The staff were so lovely and accommodating. It’s only about a 10 minute walk from the airport. The dinner was very nice with big portions and the breakfast had a good variety,4,2024,08,22
245,Great experience,"I find the hotel very convenient when flying from Dublin airport. Great location for the airport. Reliable drop-off and pick-up to and from the hotel. Great front desk experiences any time I have stayed at the hotel.
Room is lovely and always very clean.
Restaurant is very good and always get a good meal with friendly staff.
I would highly recomment this hotel to anyone using Dublin airport",5,2024,08,22
245,Restaurant staff - Tim,"We stayed overnight by airport and we were served my Tim in the restaurant, what a lovely young man, so polite and courteous, a credit to this establishment
He was a wonderful waiter and very professional and polite, good luck in college and your future career Tim",5,2024,08,16
245,Fantastic experience,"Arriving into Dublin via an international flight, and with a child on tow, I was beyond relieved to encounter night manager Ravi at the Radisson Blu. I didn’t have a reservation, but Ravi took care of us, and sent a shuttle immediately to collect us from the terminal. The walk is actually very easy also, but this was 5am and with luggage…. We loved the hotel. The breakfast was absolutely delicious and the staff friendly and professional. The room was spacious and quiet and we got wonderful rest. I’ve stayed in almost every hotel in proximity to Dublin airport and this is definitely the best. Thank you Ravi!",5,2024,08,15
245,Amazing job by Pablo,"we ate at the radisson's restaurant during a business trip and felt hungry after a long journey. good food in a nice ambiente but pablo, our server, really made our night. he was sooo friendly and funny - what a fantastic host! will be back for sure.",5,2024,08,12
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport,Great location close to airport terminals with pick up in front of terminal buildings. Reasonably priced compared to other nearby hotels,4,2024,08,12
245,Highly recommend,"Great overall experience especially Lesley who's Services are at the highest professional level.
The breakfast buffet, the room Services and restaurant menus can fulfill all the expectations of a frequent and demanding traveler in today's business environment.",5,2024,08,09
245,Overall good,"Staff were friendly and helpful, food was very good and the room was clean and nicely presented. However there was no hairdryer in the room and from talking to other guests our room wasn't the only one with no hair dryer. House keeping were more than happy to give us one but I think it's unacceptable for a 4 star hotel to not have hair dryers in the rooms",3,2024,08,05
245,Comfortable and quiet,"Great location and it is a quiet extremely comfortable hotel, with a modern style. Look forward to my next stay. m",5,2024,08,02
245,Well located. Closest airport to Dublin airport,The hotel needs to put a proper Radisson hotel sign at the airport to find out where to wait for the airport shuttle,5,2024,08,02
245,One of the best airport hotels I’ve stayed in,"Rooms big, clean and comfortable. 10/10. 
Courtesy bus comes round to pick you up and drop you off to the airport. 
Lovely breakfast, lunch, dinner and Tom service available at the hotel. 
The check in person was amazing, found us a room and got us in a little earlier as we had arrived before check in. I would recommend this hotel to stay if you want to be next to the airport.",5,2024,07,29
245,Convenient & Relaxing,"* Great Room. ( clean, nice view, comfy room, coffee maker was a bit if a conundrum but it was fun figuring it out. 😀) 
* Great Service: room was ipecibly clean & organized 
* Great Staff. ( front desk & rest of staff )
* They let me check in early which I was exceedingly grateful for.  I was exhausted from a flight and this added kindness was awesome.",5,2024,07,28
245,Ideal one night stay,Everything was great and the room was lovely 😍😎👌 pillows fluffiest ever … had a nice view … staff very kind and helpfull … from now on im only stayin with Radisson Blue … so its really big pleasure to share my feedback with you. Because i have the only great experience.,5,2024,07,20
245,It works but a bit expensive,Hotel is convenient for the airport so it works but is a bit expensive even with a 3 month advance booking so if not travelling I would look for better value elsewhere in Dublin ,5,2024,07,19
245,Airport Hotel,Stayed in Junier Suite that was lacking in everything but the price paid. Needed a hotel close to airport for early morning flight.,3,2024,07,16
245,DO NOT USE THE SHUTTLE!,"The hotel is very nice, but SERVICE IS SUBSTANDARD… especially the airport shuttle! It is supposed to rim every 20 minutes, but at terminal the wait went on and on … till another hotel shuttle drove us over. The next day even worse: we were down at 6.30 am for 6.40 departure, the driver was right in the lobby watching us, but did not get out; eventually they awaited till 7.00 am till more people came and they were too many to get on, so an elderly couple had to walk to terminal with their luggage: UNREALISTIC!l and SHAMEFUL for the price that they charge",1,2024,07,12
245,One night stay,Staff are very pleasant and very helpful. The room was immaculate everything you need is there. Super clean.showering facilities are very good nice fresh towels etc. ,5,2024,07,09
245,The Best Service by Alex!,"We ate dinner at the Radisson BLU Dublin Airport restaurant. Had the 
Ribeye steak, chips and wings. All were very good. Alex our waiter was exceptionally good! He was so attentive and really went out of his way for us. He was a hard worker. Thank you so much.",5,2024,07,02
245,Inaccurate information,"This is my first stay at this hotel. My initial impression is the hotel is pleasant and comfortable. The staff is courteous and the general services ;provided by the hotel are good for travelers.
The hotel offers services to an offsite fitness facility named ALSAA and they provide guests with a voucher to use certain facilities at ALSAA. This information on how to access this facility and their services is inaccurate, misleading and inadequate.  The in room guest information page states it is a, ""2-minute walk from the hotel"" or I could use the hotel shuttle. When I received of voucher for use, I was informed it was 5-minute walk from the hotel and the direction I was given had me going the wrong way. I returned to the hotel and requested the shuttle, and was then informed that I did not have the appropriate attire, other than swim trunks, for use at the ALSAA facility. First, ALSAA is a 1 km walk from the hotel. This is not a 2-minute walk. Second, I am not sure what other equipment I was required to have with me. 
While this is a ""long-winded"" description of what occurred, the real issue relates being given poor and inaccurate information by the hotel staff. If the hotel is going to offer a service such as this, the information needs to be accurate and appropriate.",3,2024,07,01
245,Great hotel and staff,"The hotel is probably one of the best Ive ever been to. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful, rooms are great, clean and very comfortable, breakfast is great and has really high quality and all services they offer in general are really top.",5,2024,07,01

245,Great Bar Service,"We received great service at the bar. We were served by Kaan, who was very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. The cocktails prepared by him were excellent. Rooms are very neat and have everything necessary. We will definitely be back..",5,2024,06,29
245,A really enjoyable stay!,I needed a one-night stay near the airport mid-June and decided on the Radisson as I have previously stayed there and it is super handy to the airport terminals as well as having good parking. The hotel was busy but check-in and check-out were efficient and all of the staff I encountered were lovely. It was pricey though - around £285 B&B but I really like the Radisson at Dublin airport. The room was super clean. The bathroom had a shower only (no bath) which didn't bother me as I wouldn't usually have a bath when staying there. The shower was walk-in and the toiletries (of which I am a fan) were very good. Would definitely return for another stay in the future.,5,2024,06,26
245,An excellent spot to stay in Dublin!,"Enjoyed our stay at the Blu Radisdon Dublin Airport.  Very comfortable, excellent location and all the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  The staff in the restaurant couldn’t have been nicer and Liliana in particular was most efficient and lovely to talk to as well.  Shuttle was very helpful too. Also easy to catch Dublin Coach into town for the day.  Thank you.",5,2024,06,24
245,Great for airport access,"We overnighted here recently, the first time we have stayed since we last visited before Covid and long before the huge Irish hotel price rises.
It’s still an excellent airport hotel with clean/comfortable but simple rooms with a rather small bathroom. 
The effects of their recent upgrade are obvious so it feels rather new. The room was fine and the air conditioning really efficient - likewise the 
Chalesh at reception was great and checked us in 3 hours early, making sure we got a “premier room”. Much appreciated.
The room air-conditioning is excellent as is the free and fast WiFi.
They have reduced the size of their pub which makes it much less attractive than it used to be and the food and wine in the main restaurant are rather expensive and not of great quality.
It’s very convenient for the airport and the frequent shuttle service makes flight access simple. My only grudge is the 100% +price increase since our last visit two years ago.",4,2024,06,21
245,Poorly maintained and appointed room,"Not the standard you’d expect from a Radisson Blu level hotel. The bathtub had rust full on across the edge of the tub and the faucet trickled out of the shower head while the handheld was not adjustable causing what to go everywhere, then on occasion you’d get a lovely scorching  blast of hot water. Went to plug in a medical device and 1usb insert by the bed. Absolutely nowhere near to plug in. Called reception (staff were very nice and accommodating) and sent up a retractable extension cord which you need to run across the floor. 
The introduction following booking the room states “prepare to be amazd with a blend of style beauty and function at every step”.  This was anything but. 
The hotel was near the most expensive and the least maintained and functional of other guest house stayed in across Ireland.  So disappointed to have ended on this note. Highlights of this hotel, location to the airport and staff were kind.",2,2024,06,18
245,I seriously can’t believe that a hotel that’s literally next to the runway has no secondary glazing or sound proofing!,"If you love planes this is your hotel! 
You’re be delighted to be woken at 6am with the dulcet tones of the planes taking off every few minutes! 
No the windows have absolutely no form of sound proofing what so ever! 
It’s almost as if the window is open! 
Plane spotters dream!! 
Not to mention the busy traffic going to and from the terminal!",3,2024,06,13
245,Great stay,"Stayed 2 nights with family for a family conference, family hired a conference room all went smoothly, lots of people came and booked in for the conference, all well organised and comfortable rooms, have stayed a few times here on airport flights all good for conferences and early flights",4,2024,06,08
245,Excellent stay! Lovely staff,"I had an excellent stay at this hotel short stay on the way for my flight. The food is very good and the staff so pleasant, in particular a lovely lady at reception I believe her name was Mekela she was so chatty and friendly with my many questions. I certainly will return here as it is so convenient for the airport and has everything you could ask for, well done.",5,2024,06,07
245,Lovely lunch,"Last minute lunch date that was lovely! Had lunch in Collage it was fab and great value, Megan was very attentive and friendly absolute pleasure to chat too, will definitely return for another visit, as always Radisson Blu does not disappoint top class place!",5,2024,06,05
245,Great hotel that has it all right by the airport,This is a great high end and modern hotel with everything you could need right there. Easy shuttles to the airport or walk.  Nicely appointed and very comfortable beds and great staff that helped us all along the way. It is easy to get a taxi/uber to go to downtown Dublin as well,5,2024,06,04
245,Staff rushed us and housekeeping came at 8am knowing we were checking out that day anyway!,"My partner and I stayed here for 1 night with breakfast not included. On arrival, the man at reception who checked us in completely rushed us. He passed me the card machine to pay, never clarifying the price. He then handed us the room key, not telling us what room we were in and what time checkout was, etc. The bar staff were lovely and I couldn't complain about their service. The room was nice. It was clean and the bed was comfortable, and we both slept well, until 8am the next morning when we were awoken to hammering on our door. I thought someone was trying to break into the room. It turned out to be housekeeping! At 8am, and the hotel knowing we were leaving today anyway, and we had checked and check out wasn't until 12pm, it was a bit of a joke to be fair. Overall, I would stay here again only for a night, any longer wouldn't be in the picture, considering I've stayed in other radison blus and they have been excellent and I couldn't fault anything about those hotels.",2,2024,06,02
245,A good airport hotel!,"Excellent Hotel at Dublin Airport!

We had an early flight from Dublin Airport the following day and decided to treat ourselves to an overnight stay in the Radisson, the closest hotel to the airport terminals. Here are the main points.

Location:
Close to Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport. We arrived by bus at Terminal 2 and decided to walk to the hotel which was only about 5 minutes walk away. The hotel has a free shuttle bus, just call reception to arrange a pick up.

Reception:
They were not busy and we were quickly checked in and given our key cards by a friendly young man.

Room:
We had got a great deal on a high floor Junior Suite. The room was very spacious and modern with full length widows facing the airport. There was a leather sofa, Nespresso machine, bathrobes, complimentary water and a large tv. The bathroom was modern and had a great shower in it. It wasn't cheap but we enjoyed the luxury at the start of our holiday. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. My only comment was that they perhaps put more sofas or other furniture in it, the room felt a bit sparsely furnished for the size of it.

Restaurant:
We had a lovely meal in the ground floor restaurant with a very pleasant and friendly server, it was good value for money. Breakfast was included in our room rate and the selection of hot and cold food on offer was very good and of good quality.

Check Out:
Quick and easy. The shuttle took us over to Terminal 2 for our flight.

Conclusion:
A lovely hotel with nice rooms, good food and friendly staff. It is however very expensive, as are all hotels at our close to Dublin Airport. We enjoyed the experience and could not fault the hotel. Recommended.",5,2024,06,01
245,Five star rating,"Food is amazing,  service is excellent. 
Savio is very pleasant and  very professional and so with the rest of staff. Good choices of food. All lovely. Ambiance is par excellence .  Would recommend friends to stay and try their food.. complete selection of food.",5,2024,05,31

245,Thank you Radisson Blu,"I attended a training course at this hotel for 3 days, the hotel is beautiful, very clean and has a wonderful atmosphere. I had lunch each day which was very enjoyable with a good selection to choose from, Savio the restaurant attendant gave a fantastic service. Each staff member I met was very helpful and super friendly.",5,2024,05,31

245,Top class,"Food was amazing, service was tops. Savio  was are server, he was a very pleasant man on the ball with everything! Friendly staff very welcoming. Would definitely come back. Ideal for a fabulous day out. Great choice in food and drinks. Chef was very welcoming and helpful when it came to asking questions about the ingredients and allergen information.",5,2024,05,31
245,Good,It was really a nice experience but the TV was not working correctly the towels were dirty and there were no staff who talked French so it's a bit disappointing but it was really nice to have a nice view and the sunset at night. The coffee machine and the kettle were clean and had many choices.,4,2024,05,31
245,Great Airport Location,Stayed at the hotel for one night prior to catching a flight.from DUB. The location cannot be beat and yet there was no airplane noise heard inside the room. The food in the Collage dining room was excellent as was the breakfast buffet. ,4,2024,05,29
245,On my way Home,"Excellent hotel with all the modern conveniences.  I spent 2 nights, one with Trafalgar and one awaiting my flight home. This is the only hotel in my 15 day vacation that had air conditioning.  After a rather warm  May in Ireland, it was greatly appreciated.  It felt like home and the restaurants and bar were inviting.  I got my last Guinness in Ireland  at your bar.   

It was a very comfortable stay.

Thank you",5,2024,05,25
245,Disgusting rooms and staff,"Stayed on May 17th, 2024 after a Trafalgar tour.  We were booked for a twin room but were given a single with a pull out couch that had a pee stained duvet.  They refused to give us the room we paid for and said they were full until the tour director called from Scotland then all of sudden they had a new room for us.  The girl at the front desk was rude and acted like we were trying to get something for nothing.  The first room (room 210) was disgusting and dirty and rusted and the overhead shower was broken and the knob came off.  Pee stained duvet.  No USB outlets.  The second room (320) was slightly better.  Nicer bathroom but still a huge disappointment.   This was definitely the worst hotel we stayed in out of 4 others we stayed in during the tour.  We had a twin room for EVERY hotel we stayed in with no issue.  It said on our tour sheets that we were booked for a twin at Radisson Blu but your idiot staff blamed everyone but themselves and REFUSED to be of any help but were instead condescending.  While being told there were no other rooms because the hotel was full the other girl working there UPGRADED a man because she said he was ""nice"".  I will NEVER stay here again and won't recommend and will actively tell people NOT to stay here.",1,2024,05,24
245,Felt ripped off as price was too steep for what you recieve,"Expensive and no free coffee. Instant coffee in the room. Despite renovations, the service is like 1980 with 2025 high prices. ",2,2024,05,22
245,Great airport hotel,Very kind front desk staff. Chalesh really helped us out with getting a great room. Restaurants were great and thanks to Jonathan who cared for our room. Easy walk to the Dublin airport terminals. Only 4-5 minutes but shuttle also runs every 20 minutes,5,2024,05,22
245,Convenient and comfortable,"Radisson Blu airport hotel is within walking distance of the airport, but you wouldn't know it because the rooms are very quiet which is great!  The location is very convenient for international flights as they offer a complimentary shuttle service that runs every 30 minutes and takes less than 5 minutes to get to the terminal. No worrying about sitting in traffic and potentially missing your flight. It is roughly 30 minutes from Dublin city center and there are cabs lines up outside the hotel, so no problems getting a ride into town. 

The hotel is very clean throughout the property. The rooms are basic but comfortable. We had a double bed and standing shower bathroom (no tub). The water pressure of the shower was fantastic and the air conditioning was working and efficient. It was so nice to sleep in a comfortable room our last night of our stay in Ireland.

This property had a large restaurant and a separate bar. We didn't go to either but they both looked nice.   The lobby was comfortable and the staff were all very friendly. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it to those",5,2024,05,20
245,Great location and place to stay before international flight!,"Great place to stay the day before an international flight.  The hotel room was spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom was stocked with good amenities.  A pleasant bar and conducive for groups.  We sample some like bar food; wings, flavorful and meaty, and the most delicious hummus.  I found it strange the bar had run out of chardonnay, however, I went to the restaurant they were willing to sell me a bottle, though they were running out of wine glasses, that I took to the bar to enjoy with friends.  
The breakfast buffet had a good selection of options.
I appreciated the shuttle to the airport that ran like clockwork every 20 minutes.",5,2024,05,18
245,Fridge in the room!,"Very happy with the hotel. It was clean, safe, and walking distance to the airport. I especially loved the fridge in the room!
Some of us travel with medication that needs to be refrigerated so having a fridge in the room was a super plus. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. I will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2024,05,11
245,Shuttle bus driver,"The stay was great the hotel was great but the nan driving the shuttle bus so rude and miserable and unhelpful it’s the last thing of my stay and that’s what I will remember unfortunately, needs to be nicer and more helpful. We all have bad days but I wouldn’t treat customers like that",3,2024,05,10
245,Gave our disabled bedroom away!!,"I have stayed in this hotel on many occasions and as I was travelling this time with my elderly mother we booked her a wheelchair accessible bedroom, when I booked I also phoned to confirm that she needed a wheelchair accessible room, the week before again I phoned the hotel again to check the rooms we booked 1 wheelchair accessible room and 1 double room and when we arrived the receptionist looked at us in shock and said did we need a wheelchair accessible room??. I mean what on earth??? With going back and forth eventually told there was a big party in and one person they had asked on arrival for a wheelchair accessible room and so was given our room!, this is absolutely disgraceful just because there isn’t a room available does not mean the disabled person can amazingly get up and use a regular room! Talk about incompetence!! They said they had upgraded the rooms!, no bloody good if it’s not a wheelchair accessible room!!! So no room available at all now and we are standing in the reception area with our bags and are very upset and distressed. I asked for the supervisor she eventually came out to say she was sorry and had booked us a room in another hotel and would give us a complimentary meal!, A meal what good was that?? I was  so sick from this whole disaster I certainly wasn’t hungry! I think I would’ve actually been sick if I was to eat there! So we had to leave to go to the other hotel very upset very angry and extremely shocked at how we had been treated!! 
Obviously these people have no idea how difficult it is to travel with someone with disabilities in a wheelchair there should be more training from everyone involved in your hotel chain especially when someone had booked a wheelchair accessible bedroom that they actually need one!!! PEOPLE BOOK WHEELCHAIRS ROOMS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY NEED THEM!!",1,2024,05,10
245,Excellent Hotel for Airport Departure,"The Radisson Blue is an excellent choice if you have an early flight.  They offer a complimentary pickup and drop off service to Dublin Airport Terminal.  We used this service at 4:30AM for an early flight.  The Hotel also provided free coffee in Reception.  
Thank you, 
Radisson Team",5,2024,05,10
245,Satisfaction!,"The whole experience has been absolutely fantastic. However, adding more variety like halal foods included in the menu would be great!
The view outside the room is absolutely green! The receptionists SLA is fantastic. Safe, enjoyable and joyful. Thank you!",5,2024,05,09
245,Book only if you have to stay in the airport area,"Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport is 4-star hotel however it’s more like a 1 or 2 star. The decor for my room was 1970 style and the bathroom was filthy (see photos). The toilet did not flush - on 10 tries you may get 1 success if you were lucky. And we paid near $200/night for it!",1,2024,05,07
245,Good location and great service,"Service at front of desk and in the restaurant was great. Was recommended as close to where I am needed for work.
They only thing for me was the hair dryer wasn’t powerful enough but I that’s is manageable. Great in room facilities and toiletries.",4,2024,05,02
245,Twins made my stay totally amazing!,"absolutely amazing experience. Service was fabulous, staff cheerful and helpful. Two staff in particular, twins  Megan and Meckela, went above and beyond anything i could have expected. 
So often when you get off a plan after 30 hours of travel you are met by sour, disgruntled, and disillusioned staff. Not this hotel, and ot Megan and Meckela. Nothing was too much trouble, and they made me feel like an appreciated and valued customer. 
Well done Radisson for investing in people. you have made this weary traveller very happy",5,2024,04,25
245,Good for business travellers,"Recently modernized. Attractive public spaces. 
Location great for early flights and/or small business meetings.
Friendly front desk, but not sure what was going on with some of the other staff clusters (lunch and breakfast).
Bar excellent.",4,2024,04,24
245,Would Return,"Staff were extremely welcoming, helpful and friendly from the moment I walked in the door. Didn’t stay in the hotel but attended training for two days and It made me want to return for a stay. I would highly recommend to all. The buffet catered to all too.",4,2024,04,18
245,Foodddd!!,"Oh wow, the food was amazing! I can't stop thinking about that heavenly cheesecake - it was out-of-this-world delicious!",5,2024,04,18
245,Best hotel bar I have ever been to,"Let me just say Reza and Kaan are the best bartenders I’ve ever had and I’ve been going to bars for 20+ years. These guys know whiskey, know Ireland and give the warmest welcome possible. They gave me better recommendations than any tour guide I’ve had. 
Reza and Kaan have made my trip infinitely better through their conversations and warm welcome. I can’t say enough good things about them or the establishment they represent.",5,2024,04,15
245,One night stay before flying on holidays,Stayed night before holidays it is the best option to be so close to the terminal this is our third stay and definitely our must do always . Dinner in restaurant was great few drinks in bar . Our room was upgraded to premium level 4 stylish modern really good bed and hot shower ! Breakfast had everything and I grabbed a coffee from lounge . Love the decor in lounge open plan but also has pricacy  pockets lots of mini meetings going on cool place .

245,"Well done, Radisson!","Top notch stay at the Radisson Dublin Airport! 
Fantastic dinner and the dessert (Toblerone torte) was to die for. Great breakfast assortment as well. I stayed in a premium room on the fourth floor and even though Ireland is having a wind storm right now, I didn’t hear a peep! All the staff members were lovely. Thanks for having me 🇮🇪💚",5,2024,04,07
245,Lovely stay,"A wonderful hotel, facilities and incredible service. 

Especially from the concierge team (especially Mechela), an incoming weather storm meant my plans changed and the team were able to adapt and support my change of plans. 

Thanks to all.",5,2024,04,05
245,Horrible experience,I am very disappointed as I am staying in your hotel from time to time. Seems it’s time to change the place. This time our experience of staying in Raddisson Blu was extremely disappointing. I wish you to pay more attention to the cleaning. This is unacceptable ,2,2024,04,01
245,Excellent,"Great location, shuttle service to terminals every 20min 24 hour service. Clean rooms and staff very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend my friends to stay there. Little bit on pricier side. ",5,2024,03,31
245,"Stay, park & Fly","The location is great for using Dublin Airport, room was clean and well presented ( premier room ) However since Covid 19 on average pricing is at least 80% higher on room rates and can be more than double at certain times. Yet nothing has changed in the hotel. The recognition of being a returning customer is a lovely gesture, chocolates are always welcome.",4,2024,03,28
245,SPECTACULAR!!!,"What an Amazing stay!! TRESOR & HOMID were SPECTACULAR!!! Such a warm welcome as soon as I stepped in the building!  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  My brother and I had such a stressful traveling day, but it was all worth it when we got here!! Thank you THANK YOU SO MUCH! Can’t wait to visit soon!!!",5,2024,03,25
245,4 out of 5,Immensely comfortable bed. Breakfast was super and breakfast staff were lovely.. Ashley and supervisor.  One star lost as reception staff were not rude but were not friendly or welcoming either. Also the shower temperature was very erratic and difficult to control.,4,2024,03,24
245,The closest hotel to the airport,"
I have stayed at this hotel twice. The location which is very close to Dublin Airport is an advantage of this hotel so I can walk to the airport, the room is nice and clean. unfortunately I didn't get any privileges from this hotel. I probably will comeback but not anytime soon. ",4,2024,03,23
245,Service Excellence Defined!,"Upon arriving you’re welcomed by the most welcoming people, “was even offered a sweet on the house 🍬 . Hehehe 🤣 

I opted for a coffee and a Croissant, where I bumped into Annette, oh my God Annette! The loveliest and ever smiling waiter I have met since arriving in Dublin in 2022!  I’ve never laughed so hard in so little time.

Overall The Hotel is immaculate and the service is excellent! 10/10 indeed.",5,2024,03,17
245,First timers,Pablo in the Collage restaurant was AMAZING!! It was our first time ever leaving the country and he was patient and understanding!! The front desk was also amazing at getting us into a room after we arrived at 5 am. They let us wait in the lobby and got us a room as soon as they could.,5,2024,03,14
245,Friendly and hospitable service from Radisson Blu DUB Teams,"Great customer service, very friendly and flexible. The team supporting our meeting set-up and taking care of food and drink during the meeting were attentive and flexible.  The restaurant team, especially Nermin, catered to all our needs.",4,2024,03,13
245,Dining at Collage Restaurant,"Very enjoyable stay on 29 Feb at the Hotel -and all worked out fine in regard to the Room.  I had dinner in the Collage restaurant downstairs and had some queries re the food and was served by Andrea who handled these in a most professional, helpful and friendly manner - if more restaurants had personnel like Andrea it would make dining a much more pleasant experience.",5,2024,03,13
245,One night 🌙 in Dublin,"The pillows are really fluffy and the room is immaculate. All the usual things are provided plus so many little extras..... free shuttle bus to and from airport, nespresso in my room, iron and board without having to ask, lovely toiletries.....that makes this hotel extra special.",5,2024,03,06
245,Amazing service and great location,"This hotel never lots us down. Walking distance from the airport but the real treasure is the staff. Karl in the bar looked after us all evening with 5 star service, thoroughly professional as well as friendly. The food was excellent also, will keep on staying here before flying for sure",5,2024,03,06
245,10/10,"great reception, the lady was very kind and had great energy also brilliant interior design.  amazing room, very spacious and well put (thanks room service) the bed had the softest most comfortable sheets and I had simply the most rejuvenating slumber",5,2024,03,02
245,Airport Stopover," We were delighted with our stay at the Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport. The staff were friendly and helpful and the mattress was very comfortable. Maybe the pillows could be improved but everything else was perfect. This does not feel like an Airport Hotel.",5,2024,02,29
245,Well done again Radisson Dublin Airport,"Spotlessly clean, warm and welcoming. Friendly and accommodating staff. Fast and efficient. Check in was quick and I was given the ability to settle the bill on arrival so I could leave immediately in the morning to catch a flight. Regular bus service.",5,2024,02,25
245,Highly recommend,"The staff demonstrates exceptional professionalism, kindness, and friendliness. The room was impeccably clean, and both breakfast and dinner were delightful in taste and presentation.  I anticipate that in future travels, I will opt to book the Radisson Blu Hotel once again, as my satisfaction with the experience was notably high.",5,2024,02,24
245,Great overall experience,"The hotel has been renovated since the last time I was here. It’s beautiful, lovely open spaces, great places to work at also. 
The staff are just so lovely though, really friendly and extremely helpful. Sadhbh was really helpful in particular.",5,2024,02,22
245,"Excellent! Comfortable, well appointed, with a friendly staff and great breakfast buffet.","I had a great experience staying here for one night before flying out of Dublin. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, comfortable and nicely appointed rooms. Excellent breakfast buffet on the morning of my departure. Couldn't ask for anything more!",5,2024,02,21
245,Best Hotel at Dublin Airport,"My wife and I have stayed at three of the main hotels at Dublin airport and have no doubt in declaring that the Radisson is the best.  It may not be the cheapest, but it has the nicest rooms, very attentive staff, the best breakfast and excellent & frequent courtesy bus service.  All in all, it is probably the best value for money.",5,2024,02,21
245,Customer Experience unfortunately not the priority,"The staff are friendly enough and the hotel is presented well, however upon arrival I was given a key to a room that had not yet been cleaned (dirty towels on the floor and bed not changed etc) the lovely lady on reception apologised and gave me a new room immensely and a voucher for a free drink. The room is well presented and clean but unfortunately whilst I was trying to work from my room very loud building works were going on close by which made for difficult concentration as well as difficulty hearing on my Teams calls - I did head down to reception and ask what time the works will end and was told it will be ongoing until later that day, I was offered another room but this was inconvenient as I’d started to unpack already. I was then offered a meeting room for my calls which was a compromise however it would have been nice to have been made aware of the disruption upon arrival or better still been allocated a room the other side of the hotel initially as the works were pre-planned (as offered when I asked when the works will be finished). Simple proactive things could have made this a far better experience.",3,2024,02,20
245,Excellent service ,"Fantastic service, as always, staff very polite and helpful.  The front desk is very professional and efficient. Restaurant staff and bar staff friendly and efficient. Rooms clean and comfortable. Overall, it was a very comfortable and pleasant experience. ",5,2024,02,18
245,Amazing stay once again.,"This isn't my first time staying at the Radisson and definitely won't be the last. I arrived at a very inviting foyer which was tastefully refurbished. I was checked in by Nicoleta who gave me a warm welcome and immediately made me feel at ease. 
I was lucky enough to be given a beautiful room and I am so grateful. I honestly did not feel like I was at an airport hotel and the holiday began right there. 
The quality of the bedding was excellent. 
All of the staff were fantastic and very professional. 
I will be looking forward to next time and can't recommend The Radisson highly enough. 
",5,2024,02,12
245,Excellent,Great location with free shuttle bus to airport terminal. Very clean and spacious room. Friendly staff and nice buffer breakfast. It is within 20 minutes of city centre and tourist attractions. Highly recommended,5,2024,02,12
245,Another great hotel in Dublin,"A great hotel. I had an early morning flight to the States and so the hotel is close to the airport. 
I had lunch in the restaurant and Megan was a great server. Dinner in the evening was just perfect. A great easy shuttle service to the airport in the AM.",5,2024,02,09
245,Holiday,Nazar was very kind to me in the restaurant. His service was excellent. The food was very nice and my room was lovely from the moment I walked in. Very spacious and tidy. The restaurant was also very clean and hygienic. I would recommend staying here at the Radisson,5,2024,02,08
245,Overall good,"Stayed here for 3 nights for business. I had a Premium room, which was modern clean and very well equipped. The first day, I tried the Lounge for lunch..it was confusing. No one there to seat me or offer the menu wandered around for a bit.. sat down, waited 10 minutes, then went to the coffee bar where Anthony served me both a coffee and lunch! He was making coffees doing lunch orders, bringing lunch, etc..next day, he was there again and even helped move our business meeting room around, which was set up in the wrong format..
Reception staff helpful printing off materials and generally being helpful..didn't catch her name.",4,2024,02,07
245,A 4 star hotel trying to be a 3 star and succeeding.,"Good location for airport, staff friendly enough, good breakfast. However the rooms are tired. Beds have waterproof mattress protectors on them so you have to remake or wake up in a sweat.
Bath has no plug, shower has no power.
Bar is a desert!
Kealy’s is next door for food though.",3,2024,02,04
245,Well deserved stay.,"My husband and I, we just had dinner in the restaurant in the Radisson Blu in Dublin airport, the all experience was excellent. 
We were looked after by Pablo, very attentive, friendly and professional. 
The food was top quality, delicious and super tasty, so than you for that!!
Again the all experience is indeed very much positive and we really appreciate. 
Thanks again, Ian and Orietta",5,2024,02,03
245,Best hotel at the Airport,"When we were welcomed by the Front Reception manager and told you are 'Guest of the Day' I realised why Dublin Airport Radisson Blu is so good and why I always try and stay there. Everything about this hotel is top rate, the rooms are perfect in size, facilities and most important daily housekeeping. The general hotel ambience is calming and hospitable. The bar and restaurant  have great staff and great fare.
But today extra special! A very nice touch much appreciated. Thank you to the entire team. We'll be back!",5,2024,02,02
245,Great bar service,"Reza at the bar was excellent. He was very friendly and helpful with our food and drinks choice and he checked in on us regularly to see if we needed anything.  Great Lemon Drop. The food was very tasty. 
He deserves 5 stars. 

The reason I gave 4 stars overall was that I was awoken at 6am by the sound of drilling and it continued on and off after that.  I phoned reception and they said there was no construction going on. I said there was definitely loud noises from some kind of maintenance.",4,2024,02,02
245,Good experience every time i am here,"The room was great, clean , comfortable, large
Restaurant and bar are exactly what you need after long business days.
Convenient location close to office buildings and airport , shuttle available though you can walk to the airport.
Check in and check out very easy 
Personal all over (rooms, restaurant) are wel trained and polite .",5,2024,01,31
245,Business meeting,"Lesley was very accommodating and helpful to all of our needs. Thanks! We used the meeting facilities for 2 days and all staff were so friendly, the hotel was spotless and temperature ambient. All in all everything was perfect and we would be happy to host more meetings here in future.",5,2024,01,31
245,Stayed Here Before and Will Stay Here Again,"This is my second time in 6 months staying at this property. I plan to stay here next time, my third time.  It is the best and one of the closest hotels to Dublin Airport. I ate at the hotel on my first visit and the food was excellent!",5,2024,01,30
245,"There's eating, then there's savoring","The food at the restaurant was fabulous, but when Pablo couldn't readily find the champagne I wanted he went above and beyond to see if there was any to be found in the wine cellar. It really made my day after a week of work travel. After all, the best way to experience something new is through your stomach.",5,2024,01,26
245,Dodgy window,"Woke up at 1am with a lot of aircraft and wind noise, went to check the window,it wouldn’t shut completely the handle was loose and had gaffer tape on the bottom of the window where it had obviously but taped before.
At 1am it’s too late to change rooms so had a very poor sleep.
Complained in the morning the receptionist was good but the duty manager was poor.
Apparently a senior manager is going to call and see what can be done , doubt it.
€184 for bed and breakfast and very little sleep is poor.
Check your windows when you check in and especially if it’s room 134 !",2,2024,01,26
245,Great layover location for early AM flights,"Room was perfect, thank you Nicoleta. Just check the batteries in the remote. 

In fact every one I encountered were perfect, friendly and efficient. 

Shuttle was there when needed. 

It's a very calm environment despite the extra people around due to the Orange weather alert and all flights being cancelled. 

A very satisfying and comfortable bite in the restaurant, the bar was a bit too much in terms of TV noise and bright lights. 

A perfect kick start for an AM early check in for a transatlantic flight.",5,2024,01,21
245,Full credit to the SAS Radisson,"Very pleasant experience. Especially good for an airport hotel.

Airport hotels can be very Solas. However, check-in was very pleasant. However, Liliana in the restaurant was so pleasant and particularly helpful and make us feel totally at home. Rooms were particularly comfortable and spacious. Well done.",5,2024,01,19
245,A fine time was had by all,"The facilities and room were lovely , We had dinner and drinks which  was fantastic and we were very well looked after by our waiter Enes in the Collage restarunt at the hotel , I am personally a big fan of a whiskey sour cocktail and the Dublin sour that they serve here was lovely",5,2024,01,18
245,Great venue for meetings.,Superb service at business meeting. The room was of the highest standard and had expected audio visual equipment. Lovely buffet lunch and very attentive service from all staff. Very convenient to airport and commuter links. Thanks also to Lesley for her assistance.,5,2024,01,18

From the initial booking all the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful 
The facilities were exceptional and food was really nice also 
Would recommend to anyone looking to book an event there and will certainly book again in the future",5,2024,01,18
245,Thank you Enes,We had a wonderful meal prior to our flight. Thanks to Enes for being so accommodating and friendly. The rooms were also spacious and comfortable. A great final night in Ireland before flying over seas.,5,2024,01,13
245,Very good stay,"The hotel is in perfect location very nearby to the airport. Excellent service and the airport shuttle is very convenient. The rooms are clean. Overall nice experience. There's a convenient way to go downtown take the shuttle to the airport and take either Dublin Express or local Bus 16 or 41, euro2.60",4,2024,01,05
245,Best hotel in Ireland,"Absolutely amazing hotel. Seamless experience from check in to check out. We stayed Christmas night and were welcomed by Mavis and AJ, who could not have been happier or more attentive to our needs. They were both kind and understanding about the needs of our group and quickly arranged for my entire family’s needs. Our waiter at dinner, Tim, was also lovely and provided exceptional service. The beds and showers were fantastic and we were welcomed for a very nice breakfast prior to check out. 10/10 experience and when traveling from Dublin, I will stay at this hotel no matter what. Excellent ending to a wonderful trip.",5,2023,12,26
245,Definite recommendation,"Service couldn't be better, staff very friendly. Rooms lovely, with comfortable beds. Breakfast excellent, fresh and hot. Not the most convenient walk from the airport with luggage so get the shuttle. ",5,2023,12,24
245,Great Stay,"Booked into the Radisson for 1 night as I flew into Dublin to meet friends for Christmas and flew out again the next morning. Absolutely ideal location for the airport. My room was spotless, comfy bed and it was easy to get a taxi in/out of the City Centre. I would definitely stay again ",5,2023,12,21
245,Very average stay,"We arrived at Terminal 2 Dublin Airport and as advised on your website there is a shuttle bus service to the hotel. This was not well signposted and very difficult to find the pick up point. It took us about ten minutes searching with luggage to locate the point. I would suggest improved signage or instructions to locate this point.

Check in was fine and swift.

Rooms a good size and I was upgraded due to being a blu member.

Dinner in the hotel restaurant was nice however more on the pricey side. Service again was good.

We were flying out the next day however the fire alarm sounded at 2.30am in the morning during our stay. There was confusion if we should evacuate or not as it only sounded briefly. I tried to phone reception which was engaged. I therefore went down to reception to be greeted with it is a false alarm, no apology.  I do think this could have been handled better from a safety perspective. I raised this on check out the next day where some staff did not know about this or shrugged it off as a fault. I know it is a safety precaution however they could have gave an explanation or apology.

The breakfast again was good and plenty choice.

The shuttle back to the airport again was poor had to wait over 20 minutes when reception advised it was on its way.

I would definitely look at other options this hotel was over 200 euros for one night which is the cost of a 5 star hotel which this hotel is not based on my experience.",3,2023,12,21
245,Radisson: simply the best ,"Reception: Sir welcome, we have updated your room to executive free of charges. Is that ok? Sure it is !!
This is the Radisson Blu hotel of Dublin airport. The room was spotless , see picture attached with the name of the room's attendant.Thank you ",5,2023,12,20
245,Very nice hotel and very convinient location to the airport,Premium rooms are very nice. I stay here every week coming for the business trips. Staff is very nice. Always serving with smile. When I checked in my room and saw nice gift for me with a letter was nice gesture. ,5,2023,12,19
245,Collage Restaurant ,"A very warm welcome to the collage restaurant by the Radisson Blu team. A very festive atmosphere, a nice selection of lunch options at the buffet followed by nice coffee and a mince pie. Very friendly servers. I’ll be back ",5,2023,12,19
245,Lovely Christmas lunch 😋 ,"Went there for Christmas lunch with some colleagues.  Welcome was warm and lovely with mulled non alcoholic wine. The food was fresh and delicious,  and everyone kept coming to our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. 
Thanks to Lesley and all the lovely staff at the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport 💕
Can't wait to go back in the new year.
Best regards, 
Sally Hickey ",5,2023,12,19
245,Bad shuttle service,"In addition to our stay, we booked hotel car parking for 4 days, because we were informed that there was a shuttle from the airport every 15 minutes. We called hotel and were told shuttle was just leaving hotel. 35 minutes and 3 more phone calls later and no shuttle. We are both in our min seventies and had to walk back with out luggage to the hotel to collect out car. Apart from the non existent shuttle service, there was nothing negative.",4,2023,12,19
245,2023 Trip w/Wife,"When a booking is two Adults, particularly married adults - it should not be two twin size beds in the room.
Thankfully, this was corrected by your staff and it was greatly appreciated. Wife was happy.",4,2023,12,18
245,Very noisy,"I stayed 1 night in this hotel. I booked a standard room as booking.com showed it had a bath, I requested quiet room.
Upon arrival the receptionist advised me you have been upgraded to a premium room. I said thank you. I arrived at the room to find no bath, I thought oh well it is what it is, I lay down to sleep for a little while to hear drilling from below me with maintenance going on. I rang reception who did offer to move me but said would be finished in 20 mins so stayed. Then I went online to see the difference with standard and premium. Says you get robe and slippers there was none, says you get a coffee machine there was none, in bathroom a sign on shower saying please use the rubber matt, there wasnt 1. Then in the evening I went to bed early as I was flying early to usa and was woken at 10pm with banging doors none stop for 1 and half hours. Never slept after that, complained in morning to just an apology now bare in mind I paid nearly 200 pounds for 1 night stay here. NEVER AGAIN.",1,2023,12,17
245,Over night stay at the Raddison when flying out and back,"We had a brilliant stay at the Raddison Blue Dublin airport , the courtesy bus was very good and the drivers helpful and friendly,check-in was made easy by friendly staff ,our room was very comfortable and spotless clean , but breakfast was amazing a full Irish and more besides even better than the hotel we stayed in on holiday, I would stay in the Raddison Blue just for the amazing breakfast,the staff were very friendly and nothing was a problem we asked about pancakes for my little girl and the restaurant manages asked the chef to make some ,just a really wonderful service ,I will definitely book the Raddison Blue next time we fly , ",5,2023,12,11
245,So clean and relaxing,My experience was amazing my room attendant Raisa left my room in lovely condition everything was so clean and spotless so thankful for this amazing experience. Got checked in so quickly the television had youtube on it so I could watch my favourite shows.,5,2023,12,10
245,"Helpful staff, solid airport hotel - get's the job done","Staff were helpful when we had an issue with our TV. Shuttle driver was very nice / communicated well. Everything went swimmingly. As with every airport hotel, it's more about the convenience of the location than anything else. Still, the Radisson Blue team in Dublin did a great job. Rooms were comfortable / shower clean, etc. - no complaints!",4,2023,12,04
245,Challenge time at Radisson.,"I had a very disappointing stay at Radisson Hotel. The service was poor, the room was cold, and the amenities were lacking. I arrived at 2.00 am and had to wait for more than 15 minutes for the shuttle bus, even though I called the reception twice. The room was freezing and the air-conditioning took forever to warm up. There were no robes and slippers in the room. The receptionist told me that they ran out of clean robes because it was Saturday. How is that possible for a Radisson Hotel? The next day, I was waiting for the shuttle bus at 13.00, as I had planned to be at the terminal at 13.15. However, the shuttle bus did not leave on time and this messed up my schedule. The only person who made the difference was the trainee Jessica. She was the only one who showed empathy and professionalism. She was very helpful and compassionate. She tried to make up for the inconvenience and apologized sincerely. She is an incredible person and a great asset to the hotel. I wish her all the best in her career. She has an incredible personality and outstanding communication and customer service skills. She made me feel welcome and valued as a guest.

Thank you, Jessica, for your kindness and assistance. You were the only bright spot in my otherwise not good enough stay.

P.S.
I would like to thank Svitlana, the housekeeping lady, who supplied us with all the missing stuff in our room. She was very prompt and courteous. She brought us everything we needed, She also made sure that our room was clean and tidy. She was very friendly and professional. She made our stay more comfortable and enjoyable.
Thank you, Svitlana, for your excellent service.

Both ladies are  a great example of Radisson’s hospitality.",3,2023,12,03
245,"The room lights were pretty dim. Hopefully, they'll improve the lighting and bathroom quality soon. And a smart TV","The room lights were pretty dim.
Hopefully, they'll improve the lighting and bathroom quality soon. And a smart TV would be awesome! Fingers crossed they get one soon.

The hotel is really close to the airport, its convenient for travelers! 🛬✈️",4,2023,11,20
245,Exceptional staff,"Not only is this a lovely hotel but the staff take it to the next level so professional and kind, a credit to the hotel. The bed was so comfortable and the breakfast was lovely we also availed of the airport free shuttle bus which was also great ",5,2023,11,20
245,Overnight in Dublin at Airport,"Welcomed by Julie  - what a blast, efficient, friendly and great sense of humour. This will be our go to airport hotel in Dublin. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Food at breakfast was tasty with an awesome variety. Drinks in the lounge were relaxing. Shuttle to airport was great - we enjoyed walking to hotel on our arrival.",5,2023,11,11
245,Airport Stay,"I have been staying at this hotel for many years now because of it close proximity to the airport, its actually walking distance. I have always found the staff to be polite and very courteous. The negative on the last 2 stays was in regards to the bar area. I like to sit and have a glass of wine and a bite to eat in the bar area. I found it very busy with adults and kids running in and out while they retrieved food from another area but they had to go through the bar to get to the food station area. It was not relaxing at all. I will return and hopefully I will have a different experience. I will also add that my room was clean and had a lovely view of the airport with zero noise.",4,2023,11,11
245,My Go-To Hotel in Dublin,"We stayed at this hotel before and after flying to Edinburgh. I want to acknowledge the WONDERFUL service provided by Hamid who facilitated an early check in for us upon arrival on 4, September and Joshy who provided a WONDERFUL room upgrade upon departure on 18, September. They were perfect gentlemen and true professionals. Thank You Hamid and Joshy!!

This is a great hotel when needing to stay at Dublin Airport—or even just wanting to stay in Dublin altogether. Bus #16 is just a few steps away outside and takes you into Central Dublin. Our room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Everything about this hotel was spot-on. The breakfast was amazingly good—Yoghurt, fruits, eggs of every type, nuts and seeds—you name it. Airport hotels can be hit or miss but this one is a keeper. As Douglas MacArthur once said “I shall return”.",5,2023,11,10
245,Always a Radisson fan.,"A pleasant stay in a big (premuim) room. Loved it.

The breakfast service was flat, could be better. More information about breakfast times & hotel services would be appreciated at check-in. I loved the recognition of being a rewards member. 

",4,2023,11,02
245,Overnight Transit Stay,"Overnight stay enroute to Edinburgh, very conveniently located to the airport but not cheap at $470AUD for one night. Comfortable and clean room with good bar area where we watched the Irish beat the Springboks in the Rugby World Cup. Served its purpose",4,2023,11,02
245,Mouldy and damp,"Long term cleaning issues.

Room had mould on the ceiling in the corner above the single bed. Mould
around the shower tray sides and corner. Puddles of condensation on the
windows. Carpet gripper showing near the door into the corridor. Final
problem was electrical: if the bathroom mirror light was switched off and the
main bathroom light was switched on there was an electrical issue whereby
if you turned off the main bathroom light, the mirror light would flash. I have
photos and videos showing the issues outlined here. I have informed the
hotel verbally and by email. I stayed at the hotel on Saturday 28 October
2022. I reported the matter to the front desk during my stay and they asked me to email the images and video. The hotel has not responded to my concerns so I have no idea if they are being taken seriously.  ",1,2023,10,31
245,Lack of communication,"Due to a flight delay I had a misconnection and could neither contact the hotel in nor cancel my booking. When I was able to write asking for help or a refund as it was not my fault and beyond my control, I got NO reply. ",1,2023,10,29
245,Superb Airport Stopover,Great location and excellent service with helpful and very friendly staff. Standard of food in restaurant was exceptional for dinner and breakfast. Comfortable room and great to be upgraded. Easy airport shuttle service.,5,2023,10,29
245,Not all night room service,Don’t expect any food from the ‘all night’ room service. I rang room service at about 4.20am for a ham sandwich and fries to be told the chef was too busy  getting the breakfast ready for 6.30am. So I had to wait until 6.30am. ,4,2023,10,29
245,We will be back,"Quick over night to get an early flight, this is a fantastic hotel with super nice staff. You can tell a well engaged team who’s focus is on the guest, no question great Managers driving this culture.  Room was immaculate, spacious with a fantastic shower and bathroom, did I mention clean yes very clean, well done. 
Breakfast was very fancy and delicious, the morning team were very hospitable and kind and yes very well appointed space. 
We will be back.",5,2023,10,21
245,Silly ,"Nothing wrong with the hotel except no whiped cream for a coffee at the bar and apparently they haven't had whipped cream for 3 to 4 weeks  truly astonishing I even asked for the restaurant to o be checked but to no avail no whipped cream to be had ,",3,2023,10,18
245,Alex made our night!,"We spent a very long day driving in rain across the country and wanted a quick drink and dinner before our flight the next day. We were so thankful to have the kind and attentive service from Alex in the Collage restaurant. He was happy to search out a wine and placed our order quickly and accurately. All the while we watched as he cleaned tables, sat new guests and visited in a friendly manner with all of his tables! We would highly recommend the restaurant and would ask for Alex for a pre flight meal and wonderful service!",4,2023,10,17
245,Not fit for purpose,"Just had a one night stay at this property. It offers a clean bed and basic amenities but a few important things are not delivered:
There is supposed to be an airport shuttle on a 15 minute loop from both terminals. In practice however this is not the case. After waiting 25 minutes at the right bus stop at T1  I called the hotel upon which they promised to send the shuttle. But after waiting again for 15 minutes I decided to walk. OK for me (fit and only a small roller luggage) but for many this would probably be an even longer wait. I mentioned this at check in. Apparently the driver was on his break. Second major failure was the wake up call. I requested a 4.45 am wake up call but this never happened. For me, again, OK because I also set my phone alarm just to be sure but if I would have trusted the hotel, I would have missed my flight. I mentioned this at check out and the guy said that his colleague did come around to do it. For me those are essentials for an airport hotel so very much not recommended. Also no gym/fitness in the building but I can live with that although disappointing.",2,2023,10,17
245,Great airport hotel,"Better than the usual airport hotel. Great rooms, bar and restaurant. Access to a nearby leisure club with fantastic facilities. Easy walk to the airport and plenty of transport options if you have time to slip into Dublin for a few hours.",5,2023,10,16
245,Great place to stay if you have an early fligh,A comfortable and spacious hotel with quiet rooms. Check in can get a bit overwhelmed by waves of guests. Be patient. Decent restaurant with attentive service and reasonable prices. The shuttle runs 24 hours at 20 minute intervals. Couldn't be easier or more convenient ,4,2023,10,15
245,Perfect Airport Hotel,"Perfect location, wonderful staff. Shout-out to the exceptional service we received at the Collage restaurant and by the shuttle bus drivers. Ample parking. Our room was very clean, but it did show signs of wear.",5,2023,10,08
245,"Radisson Blu, Dublin airport ","Lovely hotel, great location right beside Dublin airport. Warm, friendly welcome from the staff, Ravi and Eejay, gave me a lovely fresh, clean room with good TV and it was quiet.
The restaurant has very good food and service too. Good, frequent shuttle to the terminals.
I always stay there when flying in and out of Dublin, Ireland.
Thank you,
Jackie, Ireland and USA",5,2023,10,07
245,Close to Dublin Airport -comfortable and a good place to stay ,I have stayed here many times. It is consistent and the premium rooms are worth the extra.  It has undergone some upgrades and decor is nice.  Great beds and linens and the bathrooms are generally spacious and have some lovely amenities.  I like that you can open the windows for some fresh air.  Lobby is small and but nicely appointed but can be crowded during peak check in and check out times.  The free airport shuttle or the fact you can walk to the airport are a plus.  A short walk also to some shopping . Good amount of parking and the choice of several restaurants.  The breakfast is excellent and you can take a tray up to your room ,4,2023,10,05
245,"Decent Stay, but Nothing to Write Home About (or Post)","Clean, quiet and comfortable with large windows with and shades.  Nice bench to accommodate 2 suitcases, which is pretty rare, with table and desk.   Van service to the airport was decent.  Overall it was a decent enough stay and nothing to mark down from 5 stars, but I might stay in town next time for a 10:50am flight.  But, I did get to turn in the rental car earlier staying here.",5,2023,10,03
245,Great option for an early morning flight!,"The perfect spot to stay the night before an early flight.  The hotel was super clean, comfortable and had a restaurant and bar that were quite large in size.  We checked in and then returned our rental car.  The hotel has a 24 hour free shuttle to the airport. We returned the rental car to the outer area lot, took the car rental shuttle to Terminal 2, and then simply walked to the hotel.  We could have waited for the hotel shuttle, but it was so close that it was easier to just walk!  We were glad we had this option to stay the night before our international flight as there are a lot of lines to wait in before you get to your gate.  We arrived at the airport 3.5 hours prior to our flight time of 10:00am.  It took us about 2 hours and 15 minutes to get to the gate.  ",5,2023,10,02
245,The best most convenient hotel to Dublin airport,"This is my go to hotel of choice when I am working here.
Recently refurbished, rooms are large, clean and spacious. Comes with coffee facilities and a fridge.
Nice clean bathroom, great complimentary products.
The restaurant is really good, great food and reasonable prices, for Ireland!
The bar does snack food and a serious range of spirits along side the mandatory Guinness and a really good hop house 13 beer.
And a 5 minute walk to the terminal!
The only downside is no gym on site, although they have an agreement with the local leisure  centre and swimming pool which is complimentary for guests.
And to top all of that the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful alongside a very good management team.
Keep up the good work, look forward to coming back soon.",5,2023,10,01
245,Very quiet modern hotel with good food,"Very nice modern hotel, right beside the airport yet VERY quiet rooms. Comfortable bedroom and bed, with great shower. Pillows and duvet both appeared old and were a bit lumpy, however we still slept well.

Food in Collage restaurant was very good indeed (rib eye steak and pizza). Service in the restaurant from Nermin and Martina was absolutely fantastic - those ladies really know how to look after a customer

It's a little disappointing that you have to get a shuttle bus to the third party gym and pool across the main road (and it doesn't open until 11 am on a Saturday).

Overall, a very good hotel and we will definitely be back when flying through Dublin.",4,2023,09,30
245,Family room stay prior to morning flight,"Reserved via app…glad we did as our stay was during Hurricane Agnes.  Stayed at airport so we didn’t have to mess with transport to town.  Hotel was packed with aircrews and other travelers from cancelled flights. Was very impressed how RBlu staff responded at front desk, with speedy shuttle, and the Collage restaurant for dinner and breakfast.  We reserved family room…meaning queen bed, fold out sofa bed and single bed.  Room was clean and did not have typical RBlu expectations, but wince we just had an overnight, no issues.  Bathtub is very high making entry and wet exit a bit tricky.  Bath needed an exhaust fan.  Overall, room was quiet and comfy,meals and service were superb.",5,2023,09,29
245,Sheets were not changed,The hotel was clean overall but the sheets did not appear clean and there were crumbs in the bed when I arrived. I seriously doubt they were changed! No table in room for room service eating is probably an issue. ,2,2023,09,27
245,Great location to Dublin airport and high quality hotel,"A very nice hotel, ideally located to Dublin airport. The room was quiet and very comfortable. The dining facilities were good as well as the bar. I will definitely stay there again when I catch an early flight. ",5,2023,09,20
245,Great Hotel,"Excellent location at Dublin Airport with a clean, bright and spacious room. The T3 bar was great and our server, Tim, in the restaurant, was exceptional. Will definitely stay on our next visit to Dublin. ",4,2023,09,17
245,Overnight stay at Dublin airport,"Superior room at Dublin Airport was extremely comfortable, absolutely quiet, fully stocked with bathroom and tea making facilities. Beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was fabulous. Guinness was good. Courtesy transport to the terminals. Reception and restaurant staff very helpful. Everything we needed. Thank you. ",5,2023,09,17
245,Another disappointing meal without an excuse for their indifference,"I am only reviewing the food. The hotel itself does its job as a layover before an early flight very well.

They claim, on the menu, to provide a ‘classic salad nicoise’.  They don’t.  There wasn!’t an egg nor anchovies.  The crouton was a stick of toasted  bread crust and the ‘bacon’ was a minimalist streak of fatty bacon.

I had the supplementary chicken. It was dry, pre-cooked and obviously overdone.

As I have presented many times before, if you can’t manage a salad nicoise then you should do the honourable thing and not overclaim your meagrely culinary skills.",1,2023,09,16
245,"Lovely room, tiny TV and disappointing room service","I have stayed in the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport a couple of times recently when I have had early morning flights out.  It is usually a bit cheaper than the Maldron, which is over the road.  The Maldron was so expensive when I stayed there at the end of August (€339!) that I decided to shift to the Radission Blu.  The best way to book is online direct as a member, when it has been about €202 the last two times.

The room is very large and comfortable, with a couch and coffee table, and a tub in the bathroom.  The TV, however, is ridiculously small.  It looks about 32"" and you couldn't possibly watch it from the couch or bed without a telescope.

I tried room service for the first time last night.  Neither room service nor the restaurant picked up when I called.  I called reception to order a meal - seafood chowder soup and a Caesar Salad. Af her 40 minutes, they called back and said that although seafood chowder was on the menu, they couldn't deliver it for some reason, and I had to switch to tomato soup instead.  When the meal eventually arrived after well over an hour, the soup was lukewarm and instead of a Caesar Salad, there was some inedible superfood salad.  By then it was so late, and my flight was so early that I called it quits.  The delivery charge was €8 which also seemed outrageous compared to an Uber delivery charge for a takeout meal of €3-3.50.

So great room, rubbish TV and overpriced unreliable room service.  If you stay there, eat in the restaurant!",4,2023,09,16
245,Convenient hotel,"The hotel is 10 minutes walk from terminal 2. It has a shuffle every 20’min to the airport. The room are good size and it has good working space.
The room cleaning in general could definitely improve. The restaurant is ok but very limited healthy options and  bit expensive for what it is.",3,2023,09,16
245,Very nice airport hotel just a short walk or drive from Dublin airport,"I’ve been impressed with the wonderful, helpful staff at this Dublin airport hotel. The restaurant, lounge and bar are very nice.  Water pressure in the shower is tremendous.  Take advantage of the free airport shuttle but you can also walk there.",5,2023,09,15
245,Overnight stay,Everything was perfect for our overnight stay so close to airport. We had a lovely relaxing drink in the bar after a very stressful day because of delayed flight. Also a great sleep overnight. Checkout time was perfect as we were meeting our sister flying in from Atlanta. ,5,2023,09,11
245,Review,"Very convenient place. The room is very clean and equipped with the essentials. The bed was very comfortable. The staff is helpful and pleasant, the shuttle driver left a particularly good impression.",5,2023,09,11
245,Thanks tim,Just had some food  in the restaurant in the radison Blu in Dublin airport. Lovey food and great service. Great pizza lovely fish and chips. Tim thanks for great service. Highly recommend great place to stay and eat in Dublin airport ,5,2023,09,10
245,Recommended,"Superior room.
Spacy, clean. a working air condition.
Comfy beds. Too hard pillows. Huge double duvet Hate it. Reception fixed an extra duvet.
Ok restaurant. Adam was our friendly waiter (thanks).
3 buses to airport every hour so good commuting. 22 Eur for Taxi from rail station to Radisson.",5,2023,09,08
245,Good choice for the airport,"The hotel is modern and well maintained. Rooms are very clean, modern, spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms are fine. The restaurant is good, although the service was a little slow. There is a free shuttle to the airport every 20 minutes, so this is a good choice for an early flight. One thing I would say is that the rooms are not well soundproof, so there was a lot of noise from the corridor.",4,2023,09,06
245,Nice place to stay before your flight,What a pleasant hotel to stay overnight for our flight back to USA in the morning.  We ate dinner in their restaurant late (seated at 2100) - the food was great.  Also had their buffet breakfast.  I wrote a separate food review for the restaurant.  Room was clean and the bed quite comfortable.  Shuttle service to airport was efficient.,4,2023,09,06
245,Tim Is Fantastic,Tim was extremely pleasant and had offered great recommendations on food and drinks. The service was fairly quick and the meal was very pleasant . The atmosphere of the restaurant was very welcoming and we appreciated the service given by Tim.,5,2023,09,05
245,Terrible Room Experience,"We choose this hotel for its location to Dublin Airport. When we entered out room we noticed how old the bathrooms where. There was rust on the edge of the bath along with chips on the side. The faucet was missing a top. The toilet had such a strange location next to the sink that it made using it difficult. 
The worst however was during the night. It was hot so we turned on the air. After about 30 minutes out eyes were watering and we started coughing. Something was going on with our allergies. We turn of the air and looked at the vents and saw a build of dirt that was totally disgusting. It is obvious that they had not been cleaned for a long time. We turn of the air and had a very uncomfortable night. 
We were told by management that the hotel is undergoing renovation but I responded that does not explain the air vents unless you decided just not to bother. ",1,2023,09,05
245,Price Gouging,Had booked a room over a week ago on booking.Com for €200 checked yesterday and hotel charging well over €400 a night. They cancelled my booking about 30 mins pre arrival. Hotels like this cannot be trusted and unfortunately 3rd party sites like booking.Com can’t either.  No notification received on cancellation until I went to check in. Desk. This type of thing is becoming very frequent in Ireland.,1,2023,09,04
245,Great experience,Dinner was excellent - Tim gave us excellent service and the food was very good and promptly served. Rooms are clean and hotel is close to airport. I would recommend.  Reception personnel was very friendly and efficient.,5,2023,09,04
245,Awesome service!,"Tim, my dinner server was exceptionally polite, professional and provided excellent suggestions for dinner. He greeted me upon my second evening there and he remembered my choice of seating and drinks. Excellent service!",5,2023,09,04
245,Worst hotel experience in my life,"By far the worst hotel experience in my life.
This was a business trip with a reservation made by the company's travel agent. Upon arriving at the hotel it turned out that they had lost my reservation (made three months before the trip). Luckily, they gave me a room but asked for my private credit card number, as they couldn't find my company's credit card. It took them FIVE days to straighten things up and change the credit card number to be charged, even though my travel agent tried to contact them many times (emails, and unanswered phone calls). Finally, they charged 1299 euros instead of the 718 euros written in the reservation!
The worst thing is that they were simply lying with at least four things:
1. They said there was no reservation, but I'm pretty sure my travel agent correctly did it.
2. They said nobody tried to contact them to provide my company's credit card number, while I'm pretty sure that my travel agent made numerous attempts to get them.
3. Upon checking out, they said they had no data for the invoice, while I gave it to them the evening before.
4. Upon checking out, they said they released my private credit card funds while they were still blocked for a week.
Never again, Radisson Blu Dublin Airport!",1,2023,09,02
245,Good choice for Dublins airport,"Very convenient to the airport - the closest or one of the closest hotels to the airport - room was nice - front desk staff was friendly and helpful / and they do luggage storage - so all in all, this is a good choice for travelers who need to be near the airport rather than in central Dublin",4,2023,09,01
245,1 night stay,"Stayed here overnight due to connecting flight in the morning. Very close to the airport and they have a shuttle bus that takes your there, less than 5 minute drive.  Hotel is very clean and staff are nice. I wish the shower door was bigger snd that they provided more shower soap. ",5,2023,08,30
245,Business travel,"The gentleman Ravit on the front desk was exceptional.  
There,was a mix up with my booking and he was fabulous in getting it sorted. 
The room was clean and comfortable. 
Dinner in the restaurant was nice, sweet potato fries not the best but I was super happy with my stay. ",5,2023,08,22
245,Best Place to catch flight or rest after long-haul ,"For a transition stay to grab a great nights sleep before your flight out of Dublin (to avoid getting up early and worrying about traffic and not getting to airport on time) or to rest after a long-haul flight before discovering Ireland - this is the cleanest, most comfortable place to do it. The restaurant has an amazing breakfast buffet and the Guinness on Tap delicious. I have stayed here 3 times and the rooms are solid no noise and great nights rest.
Staff are friendly and courteous and you can literally walk from the hotel with your roller luggage to terminal 1. ",5,2023,08,21
245,Very comfortable and functional!,"Staff were all very friendly and helpful, trying to accommodate as much as possible. Even the shuttle bus driver was fantastic and eager to load/unload bags. Found the hotel clean in all areas and the room, even if dated was well kept and very clean. Towels and bed cover also seemed very recent. Climate control unit in the room worked well albeit slightly noisy. Breakfast has a very good variation aimed to please all tastes. Great location, with parking, close to the airport and as mentioned, shuttle to the terminal. Only gripes were that once in the room, all the noise in the corridor was heard, qcode for downloading the room service menu didn't work and as a business hotel, rate could be more competitive. Would definitely recommend and gladly return!",4,2023,08,21
245,Super close to Dublin Airport,"The hotel is so close to Dublin Airport, we could have walked across to it except that the Radisson kindly provides regular transfers - which is helpful if you have lots of baggage like we did. Nice comfortable rooms and a great shower with good pressure. Friendly reception staff, check in was quick and easy.",4,2023,08,19
245,Radisson Blu Experience,The ambiance is so good and the hotel team are soo kind. The food quality is absolutely fab.  Karl and Reza are around with some great servings. I really liked the bar area and the food at it’s best. A good place finally….,5,2023,08,18
245,Perfect Overnight at Dublin Airport,"We needed a room at the airport before our flight the next day. I was able to return our rental car and Radisson Blu shuttle service brought me back promptly. Shuttle service in the morning was a very short wait but a quick delivery right to our terminal. 
 Great rooms, rest, and food made the start to a long travel day so much easier and we were all well rested. Thank you!",5,2023,08,14
245,Happy Stayover,We stayed at hotel as our children were departing for USA.  Hotel gave us flexibility to do Dublin day before travel.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will use it again as we have done over the years.  ,5,2023,08,14
245,Overpriced for amenities,"GOOD:  
- Within somewhat walking distance of airport (about 15 minutes).   
- Shuttle runs every 15 minutes or so. Directional signs in airport incorrect - shuttle is located on Row 8, not Row 10 as signs suggest.
- Friendly reception staff.

BAD:  
- ABSOLUTELY NO VEGAN FOOD AVAILABLE IN ANY RESTAURANT.
- ""Queen"" bed is actually two twins pushed together.  I kept falling into the split and losing the TV remote down the split while sleeping.
- No place to sit outside.

",2,2023,08,09
245,Welcoming and friendly staff in a comfortable quiet hotel next to airport.,"Reception staff and Manager Ajay were most welcoming of we, a stranded couple, checking in late on a Saturday evening.
After a month of cosy but cramped B&Bs and village pub accommodation, it was wonderful to fall into a big bed in a large room with all the luxuries we needed.",5,2023,08,06
245,Metin Suha,Excellent place to stay to the ones to catch early flight. Five minutes walking distance to the ones whom like to walk. In addition shuttle service available every twenty  minutes. Clean and value worth.,5,2023,08,05
245,Karl for the win,"Had a work trip. Stayed 2 nights. Walls are paper thin as the tv next door was blaring both nights, I did call reception and they did deal with it so that was good and obviously not the staffs fault. Food was ok, service was great. Karl in the T3 bar was phenomenal couldn’t recommend him more. Will make anything you can think of. Would definitely come back just for that alone. ",5,2023,08,02
245,Alex is THE Waiter!,"Good food in Collage Restaurant. Really appreciate the fine service from Alex, the waiter. He provided ideal service to us and served the dishes in style. We recommend the Restaurant to all guests staying at the Radisson Blu, no need to leave the Hotel for search of a better place nearby.",5,2023,07,26
245,A bit shabby,"Struggled to find the courtesy bus pick up point but that’s the fault of poor signage in Dublin Airport. Once located we found the transfer to be efficient & regular.
Check in was fine but the room felt tired & worn. Bathroom was particularly dated with a very yellowed shower control we associated with the 1980s. There was also a piece missing off the top of the bath taps.
A convenient hotel for Dublin Airport but don’t expect too much.",3,2023,07,26
245,Poor experience,"I do not believe I would ever use this hotel again.  I was overcharged, told erroneous information about the breakfast I had purchased. Told the meal price would be removed from my bill and then overcharged.  I contacted the hotel and have still not received any form of response from them.  ",3,2023,07,25
245,A great start to a holiday,"A great start to a holiday in a spotless hotel with a comfy bed and a really good night's sleep. The staff were all very friendly, the breakfast was great and the cocktails in the T3 Bar were excellent too. 
Location is great for the airport and the shuttle staff were good. It is also a short Taxi ride into Dublin too.",5,2023,07,25
245,Stay review,We had a very pleasant experience with Alex in the restaurant. Alex has a lovely Manner and is very pleasant. His table service was exceptional and this made our stay  that extra special at the hotel. Thankyou Alex,4,2023,07,24
245,"Comfortable room, good service","Our waiter Alex was very attentive and helpful. The food was tasty and the gin and tonics were delicious. The room is comfortable and modern. Our daughter enjoyed playing ""pencil writing game"" on the stationary provided.",5,2023,07,24
245,"Great food, best service","After a very eventful travel through Ireland, we wanted easy and relaxed and boy did we get this at Radisson and their restaurant. 

We ate at the “Collage” restaurant and were immediately greeted, very warmly by Tim. I love fast service and this was nothing short. I had the Tuscany Pizza and my other half had the goat cheese salad of which left us the best kind of full and very satisfied. 

Major shoutout to Tim - he was very friendly, polite and knowledgeable about menu items and how they were prepared. It’s great when someone understands detail in the menu and not just what is printed. Thanks, Tim, we’re glad you’re here! ",5,2023,07,22
245,Amazing Hotel near the airport,"The hotel is just steps away from the airport. The check in was quick and they were very nice and accommodating. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. Even the elevators smelled amazing! We went to the Radisson restaurant and the food was outstanding. Alex was our server and he was quick,attentive and very nice. It is truly one of our best stays we have had!",5,2023,07,20
245,Raddison blu,Great place close to airport. Very efficient shuttle bus. Staff very good. Helpful. Would recommend to other requiring overnight stay Radisson blu excellent. Staff very apologetic for running out of pizza.,5,2023,07,20
245,Not comfortable place to stay,"Not a comfortable place to stay was told my room had a queen bed, but it was only a double, of course I had a terrible night sleep, because I’m used to sleeping in a king size bed. The room was very small.",2,2023,07,17
245,Wonderful,"We had Alex as our server for dinner and had exceptional service..lovely individual...loved his sense of humour and his  personalized service.  Thank you for a wonderful experience and being so interested in our travels through Ireland. 
",5,2023,07,15
245,Collage restaurant,Collage restaurant was excellent. Meal was delivered quickly and our server Alex was very accomodating and provided spectacular service with a good sense of humor. He anticipated our needs before we even had a chance to express them. Great job Alex.,5,2023,07,15
245,"Great restaurant, friendly staff","The hotel was so great, super convenient to the airport. All of the staff members were friendly from the check in clerk to the restaurant server (tim). I arrived late after the rest of my family had already been served, but Tim was super friendly and helpful, getting me a menu and some food. I really appreciate the great service and friendly atmosphere.",5,2023,07,15
245,Excellent Dinner,"This review is regarding the restaurant at the Radisson Blu hotel, Dublin Airport.  We arrived at the hotel this afternoon and will fly out early tomorrow morning. We went to the restaurant this evening and were pleasantly surprised with the service and the food. Our server Tim was efficient, helpful and professional. I had the salmon and my husband had the burger. Both entrees were outstanding. We didn't have reservation, luckily we were early and they found us a table quickly. Everyone we encountered was helpful, professional and friendly.",5,2023,07,15
245,Overnight stay,My room was very clean and comfortable and quiet.  I was only staying overnight to catch an early flight so didn’t use the restaurant or have breakfast.  My only complaint was that the wake-up call was late both in person and automated.  ,4,2023,07,09
245,great spot for the night before an early flight,"We have stayed here before and were just as happy with our accommodations this time.  With an early morning flight  out of Dublin Airport this makes everything easier.  The shuttle service delivered us to our proper departure spot.  And we were able to sleep well knowing we would not have to fight traffic the morning of our flight
",4,2023,07,06
245,Excellent experience,Had a fantastic stay! I had a complementary upgrade to a premium room on check in! The bed was incredible and the room was exceptionally clean and spacious! Food was lovely and all staff very helpful. ,5,2023,07,06
245,Great service,"Súper clean rooms, great food, excellent service, and location cannot be beat! Annette was great server!  What a shiny beacon after a long bus trip. We will definitely be staying here again on future trips, ",5,2023,07,03
245,Staff review ,Our Waiter Tim in the restaurant was a delight to meet. Very professional and pleasant young man. Food and room was excellent. Very convenient to the airport. I would recommend this hotel and will return. ,5,2023,07,03
245,Great service at airport hotel,"The service was excellent, particularly our waiter, Tim who was friendly and attentive .  The food was very good and the staff was responsive to our requests.  The wine selection was good and we had a pizza, which was great.  The restaurant, like the entire hotel, was clean.",5,2023,07,01
245,Great food and service with Tim,"Great waiter Tim.  Great food the atmosphere was friendly and bright.   The food was served promptly and exactly as I ordered it. The service was prompt and friendly and had a nice conversation with Tim the waiter. My glass of wine was OK, but drinkable.",5,2023,07,01
245,Close to airport,"This hotel was within walking distance to the Dublin Airport.  It was clean, good drinks and food. I had to book this as at the last minute due to missing a flight.  It was a quick and easy booking and check in process.  The staff was professional and helpful.",5,2023,07,01
245,Great Location,"Whenever we need to fly and have to stay in a city we choose a Radisson at an airport. First time at the Dublin hotel and not disappointed as service and hotel 10/10
Only fault was the toilet seat was loose and the cistern was half off the wall. Was still usable and we told staff so the next person did not get a pinched bum.",5,2023,06,28
245,Exceptional!,"Exceptional service from check in to check out. Breakfast was great, lunch in T3 was fab😊 Room was fabulous really comfortable, bright and clean! Thank you Natasha in events for all of your help during my stay😁 If I am ever flying from Dublin airport I know exactly where I will be staying!",5,2023,06,28
245,Unfortunate,"I ordered 5 rooms for a business trip. They didn’t seem capable of  handling that request. There was so much confusion at check in. Seemed to be a lot of miscommunication and language barriers. Married folks given 2 singles and roommates given king beds even though everything had been arranged months ahead. 

People were friendly, breakfast was well-appointed, amazing chill and seating areas. Check in was a mess, but after that, things were good. 
",3,2023,06,28
245,Stayover at Radisson before departing back home,"Speaking solely for ourselves and in our opinion only, it was a great hotel very near the airport to stay at.  An excellent place to stay either before returning back home or after a long flight.  Very clean, both the room we stayed in as well as the hotel.  All the staff that we dealt with were welcoming, very pleasant, polite, friendly and professional.  Food at restaurants were quite good as well with ample variety.  Enjoyed our brief stay prior to departing back home.  Again, everyone has different opinions, standards or expectations in what they like/dislike while staying at a hotel but in our view and experience this was an excellent place to stay.",5,2023,06,27
245,Average stay,"Could not fault the hotel room as it was clean and tidy with great facilities. Had a great nights sleep even though it was beside the airport it was soundproofed. However, our experience in the restaurant really left a bitter taste. 
The menu in both the restaurant and the collage bar was very poor. Not much choices on it and extremely overpriced for what you got. I could not get over why an airport hotel could charge so much and then the portion sizes were so small. If we return we will be eating elsewhere. ",3,2023,06,27
245,Not convenient. No shuttle. Dismissive staff,"Arrived at 11:05pm. No shuttle came between 11:20 and 12:20 despite hotel reporting 24 hour shuttle service and no indications that we should contact hotel for pick up (I checked before we took off because I knew we would not have a sim). Clayton and Hilton hotels picked up guests multiple times as we waited. We walked to the hotel across 4 lanes of traffic (passing Maldon hotel which would be more convenient to walk to if you wanted - footpaths the whole way). When we arrived, exhausted, and me clearly pregnant, the staff behind the desk was rude and dismissive. Insisted that they advise guests to contact the hotel for pick up. Except they do not. Choose any other airport hotel for convenience. ",1,2023,06,27
245,Dinner at the Collage,"We went to the Collage Restaurant for dinner, and our experience was a 10 out of 10! Our sever, Tim, ensured that we had the best experience. I highly recommend dinner at the Collage during your stay!",5,2023,06,26
245,Warm friendly smart hotel,Lovely smart modern hotel super close to the airport. Warm friendly staff that went the extra mile to check us in early and gave us an upgrade to a superior room. Special shout out to Mechela Warren check-in who enaged with us about our reason for the stay and had a lively conversation. ,5,2023,06,26
245,"Is no longer a four star hotel, the bar is usually empty but is open which is okay,Is no longer a four star hotel.","The place was good, now it’s not.
They don’t answer your emails or answer the phone .
There is limited Irish input anymore,  so the standards have changed.
Breakfast is still good .
Location for the airport also.
They are decorating some of the rooms which is needed .
Good luck .",2,2023,06,24
245,Worst hotel customer service I have ever experienced,"I’ve worked reservations in a hotel for 10 years so I understand how it works. I changed my dates on booking.com who then sent my date change request to the hotel, who declined it for false reasons (they claimed no availability but were still showing as bookable online so this wasn’t the case). I had to call 8-9 times, was hung up on at one stage by Mira, was transferred by her to the wrong person (a gentleman when I had asked to speak to Ashley, who I was told was the reservations manager). Gave my number 3 times over an 8 hour period requesting a call back to no avail. At one stage was told ashley was on a call, I asked to hold and was told “it looks like it’s going to be a very long call”. Booking.com reservations are non-refundable but they are not non-amendable, as Mira claimed. I’m absolutely disgusted at the entire team and I can’t believe this is how some hotels actually do business. Ashley then informed me that over the weekends (one of the busiest periods in a hotel) there is supposedly no one on duty who has the authority to make the call on amending booking dates, even though she has the title of reservation’s manager. Incredibly unprofessional on all accounts.",1,2023,06,24
245,Wonderful Every Time,"Another great stay before an early flight. Room was superb, very modern and appeared to be recently refurbished. Service and food in the bar and at breakfast were top notch - attentive staff and food was delicious. 
Thanks as always to Marianne for her assistance when booking the room, always a pleasure to deal with 😊
Why stay anywhere else at the airport?",5,2023,06,23
245,Last night of our holiday.,"We flew in to Dublin from Almeria and always stay at the Raddison before travelling home the following day.
A comfortable, restful night, a lovely meal in the restaurant and great breakfast the following morning.",5,2023,06,21
245,Overpriced and a major let down,"There was brown water leaking through the floor boards.......it was gross!
Also the coffee machine didn't work.
It's a thumbs down from me. I usually stay at the Maldron Hotel across the road and tha'ts where I should have stayed.",2,2023,06,20
245,Avoid if you can,"This is not a 4 star hotel. The toilet and shower didn’t work, the room smelled weird, and the room and bathroom were not updated and felt dirty in a this-will-never-get-fully-clean way. The only convenience was it being basically at the airport so we could stay there for a 14 hour layover overnight, but in the future, I would go into the city to avoid this hotel.",1,2023,06,17
245,Great experience. Great service. Very professional and friendly staff. Great location for the airport. Quite and relaxin,"Very clean and comfortable room. A great meal in the restaurant. Great service. 
Enjoyable. Very clean room. Friendly staff in the restaurant. 
Helpful front desk on arrival and checking out. 
Great location. ",5,2023,06,17
245,Exquisite dining,"We had a relaxing stay and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at the Collage Restaurant. Our server, Alex, was extremely friendly and attentive to our dining needs. We highly recommend this hotel and restaurant.  ",5,2023,06,16
245,Fabulous comfort before an early flight.,"We stayed here for an overnight before taking a flight next morning. On arrival by bus to the airport we waited the suggested 15 mins for the shuttle bus but decided to ring to check, whereupon a shuttle arrived promptly. Checkin was quick, however our booking wasn't immediately registering but  there was a booking for us two days later! Staff sorted it hastily and we got to our room which was an upgrade and it really was fabulous. Such a comfortable bed! I slept so well, much better than expected before a flight. The  shower was a modern walk-in and it too was fabulous.  We didn't have breakfast and our early morning shuttle was at the door within a minute. We would choose Radisson Blu as a 1st choice in future without a doubt for the sheer comfort and quality of the room.",5,2023,06,13
245,Closely located to Dublin Airport,"We stayed at the Radisson Hotel at Dublin airport the night before our flight.
We got the shuttle bus from Dublin Airport to the hotel.
Keep in mind that the shuttle bus only has 8 seats......we had no issue coming or going, but it COULD be an issue if a larger group needed a transfer. There is no second shuttle waiting in the wings. You then have the wait the 20min and hope that you get on. No reservation possible.
For us it proved to be no issue at all..
Check is was smooth. Room , a superior room was lovely.
No noise at all from the airport.
Breakfast excellent.
No issues.
Will definitely stay again. ",4,2023,06,07
245,Top Hotel,I was able to check in early at noon and also got a room update. Overall Service was perfect. Clean and spacy Rooms. New condition. Bathroom with Shower (Rainshower and Hand held). Nice Restaurant and in walking distance to Airport or 5 Min. Shuttle. Closest Hotel to Dublin Airport. Strong Recommendation. Will stay there again.,5,2023,06,07
245,Overpriced,"The hotel was fine but I am.unsure how a standard room could be any different from the so called premium one I had. Very basic. The hotel and room itself were very average. All in all I think I might stay again but next time I will get the standard room, mostly through intrigue.",2,2023,06,07
245,Great stay,"Polite and respectful staff. Room perfect. Great shower. Really comfy bed. The usual drinks available (could have provided biscuits, that would have been a great touch. )and wall mounted TV. The breakfast was perfect in a beautifully set up dining room. Loved it. ",5,2023,06,05
245,Quiet and convenient,"We chose to stay here on the last night of our 10-day hoilday in Ireland, to avoid any stress in getting to the airport for our morning flight back to the US. The room was quiet all night (no plane noise), and we had no delays at all getting on the airport shuttle to get to the airport within 15 min of checking out. The only reason for 4 stars in the room quality rather than 5 is that both nightstand lamps' bulbs were out or else we couldn't figure out how to turn them on, so the room was a bit dark at night. We were too tired to deal with it/call & wait for the maintenance people, and luckily the main light in the room wasn't too bright & we could switch it off from the switch next to the bed.  Other than that, it was perfect! ",5,2023,06,04
245,Great dinner!,"Fabulous dinner after a long two weeks of travel! Annette was wonderful and we ordered all of her recommendations! Appetizers, dinner (pizza), wine and desserts and we will definitely were recommend this to friends as they come through Dublin!",5,2023,06,04
245,Nice hotel by the airport,"Nice hotel. Staff at reception desk very easy to deal with and friendly. No line/queue when I checked in which I highly appreciate. Rooms were clean and spacious. 

The hotel has a shuttle that runs to and from the hotel every 20 minutes. We were able to get on a 9am shuttle without having to queue. 

Only issue we ran into is none of us were able to successfully connect to the wifi. We had no wifi issues at the other 6 hotels we stayed at in Ireland. 

Nice place. If you’re staying near the airport I recommend.",4,2023,06,03
245,Should have been much better for the price.,"The bedroom seemed very nicely appointed with modern lights and USB sockets either side of the bed and it seemed clean etc. 

But the attached bathroom, quite a contrast. Clean enough, but seriously in need of some serious tlc. Not just maintenance but a proper re-fit.

In common with many properties there is no printed literature in the room, but there is a little card with a QR code on it which allegedly provides access to Menus for food etc. But all it linked to was a calendar for restaurant bookings. I tired it on more than one device, same result. Useless.

There is supposed to be a shuttle bus to the airport terminals. The branded vehicle was parked outside. I never saw it move. In the end I gave up waiting; the weather was pleasant and my suitcase had wheels so I walked over to the terminal to catch my flight. At least I got to see the Hares lazing on the grassy areas near T2 which I probably wouldn’t have seen from the bus.",3,2023,06,03
245,Pick somewhere else.,"Hotel totally did NOT meet my expectations. 2 women in their 60's placed on a floor with screaming teens running up and down the hallway. Safe unusable/locked. After calling MTC never came to fix so it could be used. Gave up waiting after an hour.
Unable to connect to ""guest internet"". Front desk didn't answer the phone when we called for assistance with getting online. Had to go down to ask. It was a different link but not informed at checkin. 
The  worst thing was running out of toilet paper at 2 am with no replacement roll and tissue almost empty. 
I contacted the hotel after my visit. Their reply was “sorrrrry”!  Right!  Based off this experience I would not recommend this hotel.",1,2023,05,30
245,Slow slow slow,Service was incredibly slow at 5 pm. Only 2 other customers in the place. 2 waitress' working and they were more interested in hanging out in the kitchen then wait on the tables. At one point our waitress went on a break but never told us. We waited for 20 minutes after our meal and then decided to walk out. We paid the hostess and explained our disappointment.  ,3,2023,05,27
245,Excellent Hotel,Beautiful Hotel only 10mins from the Airport  I defiantly would recommend this Hotel to anyone. Friendly staff very clean and a very comfortable stay I will go back in the future cant fault anything about this hotel.,5,2023,05,25
245,Great Place to stay before an early departure from Dublin Airport,"Great place to stay overnight during a stop over between flights leaving from Dublin Airport. 
Stayed in a lovely and perhaps pricy room, on a floor that was being renovated but worth it as the room was a nice size, comfy bed and great shower.",5,2023,05,24
245,Nice but extremely expansive,"The price proposed is very expansive for one night , the hotel take profit for their proximity of the airport
The global quality of the hotel is good but compared with the price to pay for one room , it is overrated",2,2023,05,23
245,Great reception,"Very quick check in process. 
I informed the reception that I was leaving before breakfast opened but chalesh arranged for a grab and go breakfast for me. 

He is a credit to your hotel 

Fantastic service. ",5,2023,05,21
245,Unacceptable for the cost,"Such a disappointment. After a long tour and a journey back home the next day, we were hoping that this would have been a better experience for the cost and a much needed rest.  Poorly functioning toilets in the room, long and awkward check ins, trash and cigarette butts on the porch, a Caesar salad from the restaurant that was literally just lettuce and chicken... I could go on but for the price, this was unacceptable. ",2,2023,05,16
245,We are definitely coming back,"We are staying at Radisson Blu Hotel Dublin Airport and are quite impressed with our experience. The hotel staff are friendly and accommodating, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the location is conveniently close to the airport. Compared to other nearby hotels, I found that Radisson Blu stood out in terms of comfort and value. Overall, we highly recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to Dublin.",5,2023,05,16
245,Friendly staff,"Great hotel and really perfect service. The room was clean, and Cody
The receptionist, Tresor, and the driver, Guiness, were very friendly and hospitable.
We had a great time at your hotel!
Thank You! ",5,2023,05,15
245,One night stay,"We choose to stay here as we arrived into airport in the early hours. Too late to travel home. 
The hotel was suitable as near the terminal in which we landed.
Courtesy bus took a while to arrive though.",4,2023,05,15
245,check-in HELL,"The check in  experience was simply awful, rude, completely unprofessional. They could not find our reservation, blamed us, told us to leave the line up, manager was able to find reservation and check us in, but it was just a terrible experience. Please stay somewhere else.",1,2023,05,15
245,Better Stay This Time !!,"This hotel can vary. We stay here at least twice a year when we visit Ireland. This time our stay was better than last. Being a Premium Rewards member really doesn't mean a thing at the Radisson Blu. The management really doesn't give a damn. There is no early check-in and the room you ask for, you seldom get. Only the staff makes a difference. 

So the staff members who made our stay more enjoyable are as follows: Meckela, at the front desk; Ieva and Rakib, in the bar; and Ruslana,  the wonderful Ukrainian lady who took care of us in room 210 on the second floor.",4,2023,05,13
245,A first class hotel at Dublin Airport,"We arrived late at night and got a very good reception at the desk from Ajay-he was very helpful and polite. The room was excellent. The breakfast was top class-a great selection of food-a very wide range of fresh fruit.
For my first time EVER in any  hotel anywhere BOILING water was availing to make a lovely cup of tea! I highly recommend this hotel especially when one is tired after a flight.",5,2023,05,12
245,Short stay all well,It was a short stay. Very helpfull and smiling staff at all times. There are flexible check in/out for out of hours flights. Breakfast on the go for early flight. Eating dinner in the restaurant very nice,5,2023,05,09
245,Thank you!,"Very comfortable room and bed. Ravi at the front desk was very helpful and kind, and showed great concern for our comfort. Giovani in the Collage restaurant is an asset to your team.   Helpful and courteous and made sure we comfortable and happy. Thanks to all of you for a very nice stay",5,2023,05,05
245,"Go for Airport Proximity, but for No Other Reason","The good news is you can walk to the airport in less than 10 minutes. Unfortunately, that's all the good news. Our bathroom door wouldn't shut. The tub had rust on the outside. The only electrical outlets in the rooms are by the desk ... good luck if you want to plug something in by the bed. Whose idea was that? The floor in the bar was so sticky that even after walking to the Dublin airport in the rain, then through the Dublin and Atlanta airports, and across the wet parking lot to get our car once we landed at home, my shoes still stuck to the floor in my house. So yes, it's convenient if you have an early flight from Dublin, but there is little else about this ""hotel"" worth the price of the rooms.",1,2023,04,29
245,Incompetent,Incompetent at best and Malicious at worst. Find better hotel as there are many hotel near by.learned it hard way. Avoid it if you can. Lack of communication in all the matter regardless of any topic.,1,2023,04,29
245,Not your average airport  hotel ,Another wonderful stay .  My Go To place when I am travelling through Dublin.   Not your average airport hotel !  My stay began when warmly welcomed by the shuttle driver at the airport.  Short trip  but he was cheery and very helpful.  Brought my bags in whilst I queued for checkin.   The complimentary shuttle runs 24 hours a day which is very convenient.  Bit of a line up but it was great to see the front desk team really engaged in listening to and helping guests during the check in process.   I was well looked after by Mr. Charles who was very upbeat and professional and helped me with my double booking.   I had to return a couple hours later to request a room change as the guests next door constantly had their TV volume so high I knew it would be a problem (I was in a room that has an adjoining door which I think  was the major  issue in the sound).  Hr did offer to speak to them but from past experience I asked for my room to be changed and was happy to pay if they had to upgrade me.  Although they were fully booked he went to the manager and found another upgraded room and was quick to  move my booking.  The new room was on the other side of the hotel and spacious and clean with a generous shower stall in the bathroom a nice variety of toiletries and towels...Very comfy bed with great linen and pillows not to hard or soft.   I find one of the things I love about this hotels you can open the window for some fresh air.   Ordered dinner on a tray which arrived promptly and piping hot  with a friendly member of the staff.   The fish and chips were lovely -not at all greasy and had a side of mushy peas.   They are currently in the midst of some painting and decorating to keep the place looking it's best.    Better than your typical chain airport hotel and will  rebook again when I travel through Dublin again.  Breakfast is served early  which is convenient for those first thing in the morning flights and a wide variety of items on the buffet with fresh ingredients and nicely presented.  You can dine in or get a tray to take back to the room.    ,5,2023,04,28
245,Great food and a surprise…,Fantastic food from apps to main course and server gave great recommendations.  Good drink selection but was a little loud (open concept).   Loved the additional info about the room around the back of the hotel…,4,2023,04,28
245,Pleasure trip 1 night,"Near to a terminal but far from the city.  Room was excellent, but mattress not firm enough.  So sleep not as desired.  Public areas had the typically low lighting, meaning corridors and lobby were areas I enjoyed less.",4,2023,04,28
245,A great airport hotel,"This does the job as an airport hotel - a great place to stay before catching an early flight. Well appointed, quiet rooms with views over the airport, professional staff and so comfortable that deep sleep came easily. It is close to the airport terminals and made catching our flight a dream.",4,2023,04,27
245,Close to the airport,"So close you can hear first plane taking off at 04:00 in the morning. Even with the windows shut. 
The best thing in this hotel was the breakfast. There is a wide choice from a full continental to a full Irish.",1,2023,04,24
245,"Wonderful hotel, great bed","Stayed in a premium room for 3 nights with work. I have to say it was a wonderful room, with one of the best beds I have slept in, in a long time.

I never made it down to breakfast due to work, but looked very well set out.

My only gripe is that front desk at the time seemed to be fairly new and I asked 3 times to 3 different people about getting the points for my stay added to my Radisson rewards account, and I heard 3 different answers. I still dont have the points on my account an no one has emailed me back",5,2023,04,22
245,More negatives than positives,"Booked one night at this hotel for a stopover between flights. 
Positives were that the hotel presentation is good, the room was very clean although bathroom needs updating (lots of limescale etc). Good tv channels which for a night just chilling in a hotel was great for us. 
Negatives wise. Huge room but the bed was really small, feels a bit wasted space. It was very cold because of this so heating needed to be on. The shower felt like someone was dribbling on you, barely any pressure (used at night and early morning). It also fluctuated between scalding hot and freezing cold so that was really fun. When I dried my hair after the hairdryer constantly went on and off, not sure if this was an issue with the hairdryer itself or the plug. But when I went to put it in the adjacent plug by turning that off/on if affected my one (will be mentioning this to staff for safety). 
We tried to order room service via the phone but constantly engaged for 20 minutes so went down. I was met by the rudest member of staff I’ve ever encountered. She actually walked off at one point and someone else came back to take my payment. 
Overall I wouldn’t stay here again. It did the job for a night but there are plenty of other options around",3,2023,04,22
245,Stay for one night,"Everything was good, i enjoyed dinner and breakfast. Room was clean and large. Location near airport, 5 min walking to terminal just wonderful. Staff was helpful and polite. So thank to team and good luck. ",5,2023,04,19
245,amazing hotel experience,"despite being a short stay, this hotel experience was by far the best i have ever had, the staff were friendly, helpful and patient and were pleasant to chat to, as someone who was in the process of a 3 day travel back home it felt like a nice escape from the chaos of flying, the complimentary bus ride to the airport was by far one of the most helpful things i’ve experienced at this hotel too as it saved the stress of trying to get an uber or taxi to an airport at ungodly hours in the morning, i totally recommend this hotel and the staff who worked in it on the 13th and 14th of april did amazing ",5,2023,04,16
245,Quality hotel,"Stayed here at very short notice, due to cancellated flight. Cost for one night very reasonable, and room was excellent. Arrived late in evening but had chance for pizza and couple of Guinness's. They were excellent. Had full Irish breakfast in the morning, which was €18. Was told there was a vegetarian option, but there wasn't anything specific, like veggie sausages, so ended up with plate of beans, mushrooms, 2 x poached eggs. The selection, from the breakfast buffet however, fruit, cheeses, breads, cereals, cold meats, was probably the best I have seen. So if you're really hungry you could fill your boots. plan to come back to Dublin soon and will be checking this or another Radisson out.",5,2023,04,09
245,Terrible behavior from the staff in the reception.,Arrived late in the hotel after a cancelation in our flight and went straight in the reception to book a room. Mr Tresor was very rude to us and and not willing to inform us about room availability and prices so we booked our room through booking.com at the minute of arrival. After showing our reservation confirmation and receipt we were told that we had to wait 5 to 10 minutes  until our reservation came to their system which we respected and waited. At the same we witnessed behavior change towards a female customer who arrived after us and Mr Tresor was joking and laughing while he was extremely rude towards us. We patiently waited for over 20 minutes until we asked for an update and the response was rude. I asked again if he or Mr Ajay/Alay(not sure about the name but Indian Reception worker) could check again with our booking reference number but they told us in a rude tone that if it was there they would know. We waited 46 minutes and asked 5 times before we got angry and demanded to check our reservation and then magically our reservation was there. We never got an update and we demanded to know what is happening. That is totally unacceptable for such  an expensive hotel. The room was good and the lounge was good also but our experience was ruined from the reception behaviour.,2,2023,04,08
245,Disappointing all-round experience,"I booked to stay in this hotel to bridge the gap between flights. The hotel is a relatively short walk from Terminal 2. I knew that my stay in the hotel would probably only last around 9 hours so the proximity was good.
Upon arrival there were 3 members of staff at reception, 1 was assisting another guest whilst other 2 were chatting. It took about 2-3 minutes before I was acknowledged and assisted.
The staff member was slightly brisk throughout our interaction.
I hold status in the Radisson Hotels loyalty scheme which affords certain benefits. My status was not acknowledged, not were any of the benefits offered or received. [Whilst I know it sounds a bit DYKWIA, if a hotel chain runs a loyalty scheme which offers benefits to regular customers, it sort of makes it pointless if the benefits aren't offered].
My room rate included breakfast. During the check-in process I was not given any information about breakfast. I had to prompt the receptionist about it after I had been checked in, who said, ""Oh, does your reservation come with breakfast?"" and only then looked at my reservation in any detail.
In the end, it turns out that this airport hotel starts serving breakfast at 6:30am. I have never stayed in an airport hotel where breakfast service starts this late - in fact it was too late for me as I had to checkout just after 6am to get to my flight.  The receptionist said that they did offer a ""breakfast bag"", which I requested.
I went to my room which was of a reasonably large size, and seemed to have all of the amenities that you would expect. The lighting in the room was dreadful. The room relied on the use of multiple small lamps dotted around the room to light it up and even with them all on, it was quite dim.
The bathroom has a bit of a weird layout where the toilet is fitted in a corner - it actually feels quite claustrophobic when you sit on the toilet you are facing a tiled wall not far in front of you and a tiled wall on your immediate right (or left, depending upon the room orientation).  It's clear that this was to make the plumbing easier when the hotel was built rather than considering the user.
There was a bath with a shower over. In the morning I had to leave it running for about 5 minutes before anything vaguely constituting hot water came through.
I discovered in the morning that the 'breakfast bag' contained a sandwich, apple, banana, crisps and a muffin. No drink, not even water. Underwhelming.",2,2023,04,07
245,Maintenance and cleaning - not good,Location is great and service is friendly. Room cleanliness and maintenance is just terrible. And elevator lobbies are dirty. There needs to be much better quality control and service management / oversight.,2,2023,04,04
245,sophisticated hotel,"Great atmosphere, spotless facility, caring and eager to help staff members.  The restaurant on the first floor could benefit from expanding its vegan menu.  Highly recommend it to any travelers waiting for a late or an early flight as it is right next to the airport.  ",5,2023,04,02
245,SPires,"Convenient, comfortable, friendly...I've only stayed here for business purposes, but its location is great due to its proximity to the airport, business, and Dublin City Centre.
 Food is great, and breakfast improved :-)",4,2023,03,31
245,Clean and cozy,"Great service from supporting staff and very pleasant environment.  The location is ideal for an early or late flight, as the airport is visible from the hotel.  Easy booking process.  It was exceptionally quiet at night ",5,2023,03,30
245,Precious,"after a very long day of driving from coast to coast, walking in to the Radisson at the airport and being greeted by Precious at the front desk was wonderful. she is very kind and friendly...and really knows what she is doing. a great way to begin my visit to the Radisson at the airport. thank you.",5,2023,03,30
245,Great room,"Amazing and very comfortable room with amenities, coffee, tea, kettle. Professional staff, nice breakfast, amazing infrastructure. Is it located very near the airport and the hotel offers shuttle that runs every 10-15 minutes.",5,2023,03,30
245,Nothing special,"The hotel is in a great location with regulars to the airport, you can literally walk to both terminal 1 and terminal 2, ideal for staying the night before or after flying but wouldn’t recommend staying for a long time as the planes are loud and you can hear them, also there’s not a great deal to do around the area apart from the Golden Arches and a petrol station that’s about it.  ",3,2023,03,27
245,Modern Hotel near Airport,Our room was exceptionally clean. Lots of space and the shower was excellent! The free shuttle to the airport was great. All staff were friendly and helpful. We were only there one night but it was great and would definitely return.,5,2023,03,23
245,"Unfortunately, I won't be returning. ","I wouldn't usually rate a hotel so low, but I was utterly disgusted by my stay at this hotel. It was impossible to get the shuttle transfer when I arrived in the early hours of the morning- I was basically told to walk when I called. I did so, and that road is a death trap. In particular the night reception staff were so rude and lacked basic customer service. 
I have given this hotel many a chance and I always had an issue with my stay. Having visited across the road at the maldron before I will be sticking with this option from now on as they truly deserve the business.",1,2023,03,23
245,Bring an extension cord,"Very nice hotel.  Clean, nice, friendly.  The only problem was there are no electrical outlets by the bed.  Needing a CPAP machine at night, I had to ask for an extension cord.  Seemed weird that there were outlets every few feet in the hallway leading to my room, but only one outlet in the corner of my room.",4,2023,03,20
245,"Nice hotel, front desk needs help!","Stayed their both on arrival (late) and departure (early)

Location: very convenient to the airport but NOT walking distance with luggage.  Regular shuttles pick you up at both terminals.  Parking is not free.

Rooms: standard hotel rooms unless you can coax them to give you the corner room.  Succeeded once!

Staff: the front desk had all “Trainees”.  Pleasant but they struggled and badly needed adult supervision.  The shuttle driver was very nice and helpful.

Given the different electrical outlets, they need to keep some adapters to loan for those arriving from the US.",4,2023,03,18
245,Great for an early flight stopover,"Great spot for Early flight - We stayed here before a 6am flight - ate in restaurant the night before and had a few drinks in bar.  Staff were lovely, transfer was reliable and car parking very reasonable.   Would stay here again before an early flight.  ",5,2023,03,14
245,MR,"It was easy to fine your location by the internet but your pickup location was hidden and 5 years sames
location with not shownindication by your Hotel name.
Room was clean and others in the room are aceptable and ok.",4,2023,03,13
245,"Great stay, brilliant location","Recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel before an early flight. Extremely convenient location - didn't need shuttle as easy walk to either Terminal. Check in was friendly and efficient, room was spotless, beds so comfy. Will definitely stay again.",5,2023,03,12
245,Gorgeous afternoon treat,"Had a delicious lunch at the fabulous new lounge at this hotel. Our waitress Lesley was so professional and friendly, she really looked after us. Highly recommend for a visit if you're in the area, definitely not just an airport hotel. Looking forward to a return visit. Many thanks to Lesley and all the staff.",5,2023,03,12
245,Very comfortable and pleasant and luxurious,"Best hotel experience after 8 day trip around Ireland. Check in was efficient and very pleasant;
Room and bed were very comfortable; plenty of towels and mirrors for dressing and grooming; primp elevator service; all personnel so nice.",5,2023,03,10
245,Handy for early departure,"Arrived quite late for an early flight the next morning, check in was quick and easy and staff polite and friendly. Room was comfortable and well stocked with water, tea, soaps etc. I didn't eat here and checked out at 0430 and walked across to T2, there was a shuttle bus available for those with more luggage.

Only negative is that the shower pressure was really poor.",4,2023,03,06
245,Bad relation value for money,"Restaurant collage the food is terrible 
The rooms are old with bad maintenance. There is no good isolation within rooms and some are even connected with a door.
The available plugs are not suitable to have the adapter with the charger.
",2,2023,03,04
245,Great hotel stay,Very modern hotel with a great shuttle bus service to the airport. We got an airport view on request.  All you need at an airport. I would consider staying again. Note it is possible to walk to the Terminals but there are busy roads to cross so I'd recommend the bus. ,5,2023,03,02
245,Quick Lunch before flight,Stopped by for a quick lunch disappointed with the menu to start but had left it too late to go somewhere else. Service was slow the lunch was ok just a chicken tikka wrap .Ordered soup with it and it cam out cold then when it did come out I was finished my wrap. Very disappointed as normally would come for lunch before a flight .,2,2023,02,27
245,A great weekend,The Radisson blu played host to Irish Powerlifting Nationals 2023. The staff were friendly and professional. The venue was great for the purpose. Thank you to all involved. Here's hoping to more events here in future.,4,2023,02,27
245,Very Clean Hotel,"We love this hotel. Its our second time , should be third but we tried the other hotel but find it outdated and small room compare to Radisson Hotel which is very clean and friendly staff.. Restaurant was good choices of food. Waiter/s/ Waitress are very pleasant. In the bar t13 the service are good too. Receptionist/s are very nice. 
Over all   Radisson Hotel Airport is fantastic. . ",5,2023,02,24
245,Family plane spotting trip,"A really very pleasant stay indeed. I booked this hotel as a plane spotting excursion for my teenage sons, its location to the airport with excellent with a handy free shuttle service to use. Upon arrive we were greeted by a lovely young lady, a trainee I believe called Sophie. She was so informative, offered me 2 free coupons to have complimentary drinks upon arrival, asked what time I would like to have our room made up each day and kindly gave us a late check out again complimentary. The hotel was clean, the staff kind, breakfast satisfactory and the food was tasty. The coffee in the lounge in the best to date I have tasted and I have tasted a LOT, the gentleman who made our coffees was proud and consistent, the lady that took our order (I forget her name) was really friendly and smiley. The hotel certainly ticked the boxes we required for the duration we were booked in for which was 3 nights. Thank you Radisson Blu Dublin Airport 🙏🏼",4,2023,02,21
245,Business trip 1 night,"Ample parking, 5 mins from the airport. Check in was quiet no queues, receptionist was lovely had an upgrade to my room. 
Room was warm and quiet, no bath but nice waterfall shower. 
Restaurant was also quiet salmon and noodles tasty but probably would have used mange tout rather than green peppers, Baileys cheesecake delicious. Great 1 night stay !",4,2023,02,19
245,Layover,"A great stopover to wait for your next flight. The service, room and meals were excellent. It was positive for us that we didn't have to use a taxi or the airport shuttle to get to the airport. The airport terminal was reached in a 10-minute walk.",5,2023,02,19
245,"Superb service, great location","Check in staff were personable, professional and in general a credit to this hotel chain.
Room was excellent and the buffet breakfast was easily one of the best.
Location ( 5 mins walk to local gastro pub ) was a bonus.
A great night sleep and a great terminal transfer",5,2023,02,17
245,Excellent friendly hotel,"Very nice quality hotel with very friendly and professional staff. The rooms are clean, very comfortable. The hotel staff are customer focused and keen to help with any queries and very good food in the restaurant and bar.
",5,2023,02,16
245,Dublin Stay at Radisson Blu,The place was very clean and the staff were very accommodating.  Check in went extremely well without any issues.  Check out went just as well.  Shuttle bus was a big plus for me. Would definitely stay in this hotel again.,5,2023,02,12
245,Terrible staff non existent room service.,"We have stayed in hotels all over the world but this has to be one of the worst experiences we’ve ever had.  On arrival the receptionist was obnoxious, rude and unhelpful.  Tresor was in charge and I don’t think I’ve ever had the misfortune of ever meeting anyone less helpful.

We then ordered room service because the bar was shut just after 11 which was very disappointing on a Friday in Dublin !  After we made the order they asked if we would want it delivered to the room or do we want to come down and collect it???  If we wanted it delivered to the room ie room service it was and additional €8!

Seriously go somewhere else this place is an expensive joke.",1,2023,02,10
245,"Really average, tired, expensive hotel.",Tired hotel. Tired staff. Basically a premier inn with premium branding and double price. Slow check in with 6 people in front of us and one person at concierge. Our delivered food times to arrive 20 mins after us got cold. Then refused to send us cutlery to room without charge. Premium room with instant coffee rather than coffee machine is so thoughtless and cheap. Room looks tired only good things waterfalls shower ( but leaks on ground) and big TV. Bar drinks overpriced and icy. Exorbitant breakfast cost ( I think 18€ EACH) with dreadful coffee and pathetic vegetarian options. Proximity and shuttle to airport ( 5mins) is its only real plus- but not really worth it. Crown plaza or Prem Inn next time with 10 mins shuttle for us. The whole building and management need a serious refurb retraining and upgrade. ,2,2023,02,08
245,Short Business Trip,"Hotel was clean and quiet, everything was good. Stuff was friendly and helpful. 
Location near airport, give chance to sleep a little more before travel. 
Perfect for Business trips. I would sleep there again. ",5,2023,02,07
245,stopover betwen flight connections,"A very conveniently located hotel, shuttle available every 20 mins or so.
The room was very clean and there was a lt of space for working.
Shuttle location near Buss Stop 8 for Trminal 1.
Fast checkout is available.
ha dno time to try out the restaurants.
Very pleasant staff ",5,2023,02,06
245,Highly recommend.,"  Very comfortable, clean and hospitable. Tresor, was a superb host, extremely accommodating who also went out of his way to ensure my early morning airport transfer, by facilitating the travel himself. ",5,2023,02,06
245,"Nice room, but outdated bathroom","Room was nice and spacious, good breakfast and friendly staff. The main issue was the bathroom, very outdated, felt dirty due to age and condition, and almost no water pressure in the shower. It seems like the room itself was renovated, but the 80s bathroom was left alone ",4,2023,02,04
245,Okay,"Very expensive and doesn’t include breakfast which is 18 euro each . Could include better hot options for vegetarians/vegans 
Shuttle bus service is good but the bus only fits 8 people at a time. The new renovations have made the hotel look great and the staff in the kitchen are very friendly.",3,2023,01,31
245,Perfect spot for an overnight stop,"It's very close to Dublin Airport so nice and convenient, rooms are quite big, clean and well maintained with good wifi. There's a pub just next door too, but the bar was quite pleasant and the restaurant looked nice. I'd be happy to stay again if travelling through Dublin",5,2023,01,30
245,Avoid at all costs,"What a shambles this place is. Management in the breakfast room are a disgrace. The manager Ajae? Was so rude and dismissive when asked for more milk and gluten free options, was basically told ""self service and whatever we have on display is all we have"" f&b staff were all over the place, definitely lack of training, I wouldn't mind we counted 9 tables that were occupied. Very bad experience. There is a maldron across the road, which we have already booked for the summer and cancelled the Radisson. Very disappointing.",1,2023,01,24
245,Great place to stay for early flight,"We stayed here in preparation for a 5am flight back to Sydney.  Staff were lovely, shuttle to the airport runs 24 hours and the check-in/check-out experience was a dream.  Room was comfortable and bar was open til late.",5,2023,01,22
245,Ideal airport hotel,"Super convenient for the airport, room and decor in general was excellent, very fresh, clean and modern. Staff were by and large very friendly and helpful- but the bar lets the hotel down. 

It's very basic decor-wise when you see the rest of the common areas. 

My partner is from the US and asked for a Manhattan, a pretty standard drink, and was told he could have what was on the cocktail menu only. 

I asked if we told them how to make one, (there are only 3 ingredients and they were all on display), if they would oblige and they just said ""no"". It was quiet, 9.30ish on a Saturday evening. 

Shuttle bus runs every 15 minutes, parking is reasonable, really very good hotel overall, just a shame about the bar being so basic, the staff were not skilled at all.

 
The Maldron is nearby if we want to have a Manhattan on our next stay I guess, but would highly recommend this hotel in general.",4,2023,01,22
245,The perfect hotel for one day meetings in Dublin,"Radisson Blue Hotel Dublin Airport is the perfect hotel when you have meetings in Dublin where you need to get in and out within one to two days. I waliking distance from the Dublin Airport, and the service at Radisson Blue Dublin Airport it perfect. The staff is super friendly and very professional",5,2023,01,18
245,Great,Staff very friendly and steak cooked to perfection and my wife enjoyed her Salmon.  Room was perfect and shower superb.  I have never experienced complimentary refreshments which were very cool and refreshing we thank you and hope to come again soon ,5,2023,01,17
245,Awesome all around!,"Awesome - all around - hotel stay, breakfast buffet, and complimentary shuttle!   Perfect place to unwind for our very long layover.   Our room was spacious, nice, and clean.  Beds were super comfy.   Breakfast buffet had pretty much everything you need to start your day.   The shuttle service comes every 20 minutes.",5,2023,01,14
245,Wonderful,"Great stay before an early morning flight. Room seemed to be recently renovated and was immaculate!
Breakfast hit the spot the next morning too, the buffet had everything you needed plus more. 
A special thanks to Marianne in reservations for her help and assistance - always a pleasure to deal with 😊",5,2023,01,10
245,A comfortable stay and would recommend,"We stayed here for one night. We used the shuttle bus to get to the airport and used the airport bus to go into Dublin town which was cheap and convenient. 
The walk from the airport to the hotel is easy enough and around 6 minutes, but if you have luggage, it’s just easier to use the hotels shuttle bus.
The room was comfortable, and we really enjoyed the breakfast. 

I would certainly look at booking here again when I am in Dublin.",4,2023,01,08
245,Conveniently located for travel from Dublin Airport,"Excellent courtesy bus to the airport. Very professional and helpful drivers both being brought to T2 and again when being picked up on our return. Friendly check in. Very underwhelming room despite booking a 'superior' room and being a member of Radisson Rewards. Comfortable beds, excellent duvets, pillows, linen, towels, complimentary toiletries, hair dryer, tea/coffee facilities. Room very stuffy smelling of 'artificial air fresheners' on arrival. Had to open window and door to 'ventilate'. Décor dull - so dull and dark. Good quality sleep. Overall an adequate place to spend a night before/after using Dublin Airport. ",3,2023,01,06
245,Recent stay,"Extremely comfortable experience from beginning to end ,food was fantastic and staff were very friendly and helpful.The room itself was immaculate and I can highly recommend a visit to anybody looking to stay in the area..thank you",5,2023,01,03
245,Great layover experience,"We had a ten hour layover at Dublin airport and booked the hotel room to use for the day to sleep and shower.  The room was lovely, clean and quiet. The bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent. We will stay here again next time we get to Dublin. ",5,2022,12,31
245,Sportactive,"The hotel is very comfortable and has a stylish lobby with good bag storage and helpful receptionist.
The dining experience was excellent with service and  great tasting food .
The room experience was comfortable .The bath room Shower area was not cleaned to the standard i would expect of the Radisson as there was a selection of hair on the wall tiles.
Overall i would recommended the Radisson Airport Hotel    ",5,2022,12,30
245,Great experience,"Great experience with the staff, room service was quick and perfect, van to the airport was very easy, the night workers were so nice and friendly, the hotel is so clean and organized, I felt like home.",5,2022,12,26
245,Double bed booked got switched to 2 twins,"Usualy stay at the Clayton and never had a problem there but thought i would  give here a go! Booked a double bed and got switched to 2 twin beds and was told it was an upgrade 😄
I won't be returning.",1,2022,12,22
245,Exceptional Sta,I found your staff extremely helpful and very patient with a tired traveller who needed help. I discovered I had a visa problem on my drive to Dublin and your reception staff sorted my queries extremely well. Thank you. ,5,2022,12,22
245,Worst hotel experience of my life,"Called ahead and ask to verify if they have 24 hr room service, as my flight got in at 1 am and I hadn’t had a chance to eat dinner. They reassured me that yes, of course, I could order room service when I arrived.

When picking me up, the shuttle driver smashed my bag into the back seat of the van very rudely, even though there were fragile items in it.

I arrived and they informed me the kitchen was closed for cleaning so I could not eat. So I went straight to sleep.

I woke up starving, went to the restaurant to eat, they informed me it didn’t open until 6 pm.

Then, I was informed the electricity would be out for three hours in the whole building that afternoon. 

Went back to my room. When the electricity was back on, a light was broken. 

Room was NEVER cleaned - not once over two days. Rooms are cold, dark and impersonal. The coffee and tea are sparse and very cheap quality. 

On the morning of check-out, a housekeeper banged on the door at 7.30 am and as I was about to shower I said “please come back later!” - she didn’t listen and opened the door on me naked. 

Worst of all, I found black mold on both of my pillows. I had slept on black mold all night.

I informed the hotel staff, showed them pictures of the black mold that had been right up against my face all night - no offer for compensation of any kind, only a small apology. 

Then, when I had to leave for the airport to catch my flight, I waited for over 15 minutes for the shuttle to arrive before I just called a taxi.

Absolutely appalling hotel. And to pay over 300 euros for one of the most disgusting, disappointing hotel experiences of my life… insane.

The only upside is that their burger is good, and the restaurant staff was kind.",1,2022,12,20
245,Overnight for an early morning flight,"We overnighted at the Radisson Blu hotel at Dublin airport to catch an early morning flight. We were checked in by Katie and she was very thoughtful and efficient and welcoming. We had dinner at hotel and it was enjoyable. It was close for us to walk from airport after getting bus from city center and in morning we took the free Radisson shuttle bus to the airport (less than 5 minutes). I was welcomed by Katie as a premium Radisson member, which was appreciated.",5,2022,12,19
245,"Great staff and location, clean and comfortable place to stay.  Not your average airport hotel ","I have stayed here before and the proximity to the airport is great. To be honest my last stay was not the best but I wanted to give the hotel a second chance after some emails with their location.  I arrived in Dublin after delays and also bags in tow although they were supposed to be put through to the next leg as a layover was booked.  I was struggling to get all the luggage sorted and out to the shuttle and Leanne at the front desk said she would  get some help and would call me back.  When she could not reach me she actually came over to give me a hand and make sure I was looked after.  The room was beautiful, top floor corner and nicely decorated and very comfortable    Lovely bed with crisp linens and a desk and a table and nice chair to relax.  A very large wall mounted TV was perfect as it could be positioned to wherever in the room you wanted to watch.  The windows were immense and being a corner overlooked 2 different views.  Lovely big walk in shower and a great selection of toiletries.  Dinner  of fish and chips and a slice of Bailey's cheesecake completed the day.   
Staff were all welcoming and efficient and greeted arrivals warmly.   A great place to stay.  ",5,2022,12,18
245,Overnight stay while travelling from Ireland to Australia,Fantastic experience in this hotel great evening meal brilliant nights sleep in really comfortable bed excellent room great breakfast in morning and free shuttle to the airport and very friendly staff would definitely recommend this hotel ,5,2022,12,18
245,Nice and quiet stay,"Nice and quiet stay for a 2 days business trip. The hotel is super close to the airport, employees are very polite and the room was comfortable, warm and welcoming. Unfortunately the moquette had some hair and dust clogged up. The rooms are sound proof. ",5,2022,12,18
245,No heating working in the room,"It must’ve taken 25 minutes to check in, reception staff, more interested in talking to one another than looking after the guess, but somebody should tell them no gas, no business no business no job. The receptionist wanted to take a copy of credit card., after paying via the card terminal at reception said it was a new process hotel required them to do. No heating working in the room. , little bit of a problem when I was -5 outside, The beds are very small, even though it was a premium level room requested. Hotel and rooms in need of upgrade.",1,2022,12,18
245,Avoid if possible,"An airport hotel who doesn't seem to understand the nature of what a hotel at an airport is for. Probably great as a fly-in, fly-out conference centre but not for people who need access to the airport.

- Shuttles don't run on the schedule they tell you so don't rely on this for your flights
- No room service
- Getting food in the restaurant seems to be only possible for 1% of guests... if you didn't win the lottery then you go hungry
- Food Delivery services won't deliver to the property
- Pillows are old, worn out and stink of stale sweat

Staff seem aware of this and honestly felt sorry for them as there didn't seem to be anything they could do",1,2022,12,14
245,Abysmal customer service,"Abysmal customer service
3.0
 
Disliked · I arrived late at Dublin airport T1 going to the designated pick up point for the hotel curtesy coach. I called the number provided to advise I was waiting and was informed I would be picked up within 5 minutes, after 24 minutes I called back and was advised the bus was on the way. After another 16 minutes I called back - same response driver will be contacted and I will be picked up within 5 minutes.

During this time another hotel curtesy bus (Maldron)  had called twice for its guests and I confirmed with him I was in the correct pick up area for the Radisson Blu, he felt a bit sorry for me as the temperature was sub-zero on this night - after 50 minutes of waiting and 3 calls to the Radisson I availed of his offer to get to the Radisson

On check in at the Radisson (about 11:10pm) it became apparent to me they didn’t give a dam, there was a perfunctory apology. The bar was closed so no chance to obtain a hot coffee and sandwich, I requested a refreshment be sent to my room for which I was charged and the Night Manager was pleased to inform me he would absorb the Tray charge of 8 Euro.

At no point had Radisson management investigated this incident to identify what had been the cause of this failure to identify how it may be avoided in future

Abysmal customer service is how it should be fairly described, and i note similar complaints have been made by others on this same topic. the Radisson is misrepresenting its hotel facilities by claims they provide a shuttle bus service",1,2022,12,13
245,Come on Radisson...you need to improve! ,"We stay here regularly,  and most times...its good. Staff are fabulous,  that's really what brings us back. The lovely Andrea is the restaurant is a dote. They have recently refurbished,  thank god...but you can't ALWAYS be guaranteed one of the upgraded rooms...so do ask. The cleaning of the rooms is a bit hit & miss. I moved the couch as I dropped an ear bud for my phone, and hmmm...big mistake 😫 bits of biscuits underneath. Nicola on reception was so lovely...but...and yes...unfortunately..there's a but..breakfast in the morning was chaotic.  No bread at buffet, no mugs at the tea and coffee stations,  which were a mess, needed a good clean. And when asked for poached eggs, well, 20 mins later they arrived.  No cream for porridge,  I mean come on guys...and none of the staff seemed to know WHAT they were doing. I was about to loose the plot ...when the lovely Scott ( in training) came and apologised to us for the total mess .
So...will we come again?...yes..but please please can someone take this advice, clean the rooms properly,  and train the staff, and have someone managing them at busy times.",3,2022,12,09
245,Short Stay,One overnight stay with pick-up and return to the airport by shuttle bus. Comfortable room and great breakfast. Guest Wifi network unreliable but conference centre Wifi network excellent. Room temperature low and controls very slow to react.,5,2022,12,08
245,Good Pre-travel place,"Stayed here before going on a winter holiday. Handicapped room. Had all the basics but shower a bit drab. Restaurant, Collage, had a decent menu (tip - parmesan/truffle fries were perfect). Priced fairly for Dublin. Very quick airport shuttle service - always appreciated.",4,2022,12,07
245,Only good for business people,"Not a good place a good place to stay if you’d like to be closer to the city center and all the activities and food. It’s walking distance to the airport and 20-30 min taxi to anywhere cool.  The lobby, lounge and bar photos are not representative of what the rooms actually look like. Room bathrooms are very disappointing. No complimentary food, snack or anything on lobby except lemon water. ",2,2022,12,04
245,Nice Hotel but shame about the cleaning service and noise!,"I stayed here for work for 2 nights and never got my room cleaned? i had to ask the cleaner for clean towels the following morning which is not good for a costly Hotel such as this? 
During the night i found that the hall way way was very noisy with no soft close on the doors? which meant every door closure was heard.",2,2022,11,30
245,Overnight stay,Picked up from the airport a good service. Check in was nice and easy and friendly welcome too. The premier room was outstanding very spacious and clean. We booked the restaurant a nice welcome and the food was outstanding and the service too. The overall stay was excellent we will be booking again in the future.,5,2022,11,29
245,Before flight stopover,Perfect location for airport and very convenient for our needs. Will definitely use this hotel again if flying from Dublin. Bar was well stocked and the restaurant meals was delicious. Found the staff very helpful.,5,2022,11,29
245,Perfect Location for a Morning Flight,The Radisson Blu Hotel Dublin Airport is a good hotel to stay at to catch a morning flight. There is a shuttle to the airport. Our room was large and clean. The food in the restaurant was better than most food in hotels. My wife and I will stay at the Radisson again in the future.,5,2022,11,26
245,Do yourself a favor and stay at the Maldron,"I'm experienced in hospitality and have to say, the front staff at this hotel after 9PM are just the wrong kind of people working and interfacing with guests.  Plain and simple.  I had booked on Booking.com 90 mins before and came to the desk tired around 10PM and with confirmation in-hand along with proof of pre-payment.  The front desk worker said she couldn't find me in the system and that I'd have to wait for a while for it to refresh over from Booking.com.   No apology, no real eye contact or pro-active attempt to fix the situation.  Other co-workers silent and expressionless.  So, I stood at the desk for 20 mins while she continually hit refresh on the computer screen.   An employee should be trained to provide a room to someone in the meantime and apologize for whatever delay in the system is causing issues with the reservation.  I had my confirmation number ready to go and wanted to go to my room after the shuttle was very delayed.   She just didn't get it.   She finally got the booking to work and kept her head down, no apology for the wait, and gave me my card without saying much.  I told her that that's not how you treat guests, she would be much better off taking ownership of the situation and providing a temporary solution while she worked out the issue with the computer.   Wrong way to treat a customer.   Also, the shuttle driver was 25 mins late at the airport.  The sign at the airport says shuttle runs every 15 mins, and he came after 40 mins of me (and 5 others) standing in the 4 degree weather, while no one answered the calls to the front desk.  Shuttle driver was apathetic like the rest of the staff.  Incompetence.  I will definitely stay at the Maldron next time, whose shuttle passed twice in the time we waited for the Radisson.   Please address this with your staff and get better people in there!",2,2022,11,23
245,Short ! but nice stay,"Nice place to stay for business and early travel by plane. Very professiional personnel and welcoming. Good location, very close to the airport and easy to take a taxi from there to downtown Dublin for a walk and for a visit.
 ",4,2022,11,21
245,"Comfortable room, great shower, nice facility, helpful desk staff, lacking in some conveniences","First trip to Dublin. I knew we would be jetlagged and brain dead from traveling. I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the airport, the free shuttle and brand familiarity. It is definitely what I would call an ""American-style"" hotel. The only things missing were the ice bucket and a dresser. The bed was comfortable although it seemed to be two twins pushed together to be a double. The shower water pressure and temperature were great. The front desk was great. Since our flight arrived at 8:30am and check in was at 2p, they stored our luggage for us and gave us information on how to get to city center for lunch. This hotel is next to the airport so technically, if you knew where you were going, you might be able to walk there faster than waiting for the shuttle. 

As a first-time visitor, finding the shuttle was challenging to us as weary travelers. I never found good directions and the airport signs were not helpful.  So... as you leave baggage claim, make your way to the front of the airport building but don't cross the bridge. Look to your right. There are three lifts or some escalators. Take those down to the first floor and out the doors that lead outside that are straight ahead from the escalators - marked ""smoking area"", turn right once outside and look for a sign on the pole that has the name of the hotel on it. Wait there for the shuttle.

The big downside to this hotel was that you really only have the hotel restaurants for snacks, food and drinks. The nearest cafe I could find was in the airport. There are no vending machines in the hotel (American thing?), and I was told the bar closed at 10pm if I wanted a soda. (We grabbed some sodas at city center.)

Our only complaint was that when we had a small problem with the room, no one at the front desk answered the phone. When someone went downstairs, there were staff members standing around (not answering the phone). In the end, it all got sorted but it took a lot longer since there were some elevator rides involved.

I would recommend this hotel. It worked well for that first night of jetlag sleep. Plus, if you can't get into a room due to an early arriving flight, the staff can help you out.",4,2022,11,21
245,Brief reunion.,"Our son was travelling from Düsseldorf to New York via Dublin, which required an overnight stay at Dublin to accommodate his connecting flight from JFK to final destination. My wife and I decided to travel to Dublin to meet our son and stay at the Radisson Blu at the airport for convenience and previous experience of the Radisson brand. We weren’t disappointed, when checking in I explained about our sons imminent arrival and the hotel courtesy bus driver offered to take my wife and myself up to the airport arrivals to meet our son, which I consider to be above and beyond and very thoughtful and appreciated by us all. Being a late arrival, the restaurant was closed so we ate in the bar, which served us with pizza and fries, it was a well cooked pizza, crispy and non-greasy fries. Overall a very enjoyable and comfortable stay at the Radisson blu!",5,2022,11,21
245,"Room nice, everything else over priced",I wouldnt stay here again. For the nightly rate and then having to spend an additional 30-50 to park on site. The room service was not anywhere near the quality of the price paid... location was great and room was clean.,3,2022,11,21
245,Superb Hotel with 1st Class Staff,"I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights - I was initially only there for one night before my flight back to Washington DC but due to some issues with my American Passport, I ended up staying a second night with a visit to the US Embassy included.  The staff were incredibly helpful both on my 1st check in and when I appeared back 20 minutes after checking out - they even gave me the same room and a special discount when they heard my situation!  

The hotel is wonderful - so clean, comfortable, quiet and appealing.  The 1st night my family dropped me off so we had a late evening snack in the Collage and the staff were so wonderful, particularly to my teenage niece!  The service was fast and the quality of food fantastic.  I missed breakfast the next day due to my early flight (initial plan) but when I got back to the hotel they didnt hesitate to recehck me back into my vacated room and housekeeping even refreshed my supplies having been told I was back and staying a 2nd night!  The staff are incredibly helpful, friendly, caring, considerate and its clear they all care about customers.  

Best hotel I've stayed in, in years.  I travel a lot for work all over the world and have to say this is my new favorite!  The clientele on the days I was there was very mixed - between people staying due to early flights out and/or early arrivals into Dublin Airport (which by the way is 2 mins up the hill) along with business people - a lot of Japanese business men while I was there and all seemed to be enjoy the spirit of the irish welcome they got.  Hotel is immaculate, warm and cozy on a cold night - the beds are exceptionally comfortable - i didnt even want to get up in the morning!! Great mix of tv channels,  coffee and tea (with a proper kettle - what's not to love about that) and bottled water.  The room in the fridge was super handy as I like fresh mil
k for my tea and the staff in the restaurant had no hesitation offering me a jug for my room.  Love it!  I got the hotel bus upto departures as I had 2 heavy suitcases and the driver is a gem - helpful and chatty - lovely personality.  This hotel nails it on every level!  I wont hesitate in using this hotel again when I've early flights in or out of Dublin - so convenient and handy both for the airport itself but also if you have time to take a trip into the city.  Incidentally the cost of a taxi to the US Embassy, Ballsbridge was eu 30.00 and the cost of the FastTrack bus from Customs Quay back to the airport was eu 7.00",5,2022,11,20
245,Amazing start to great holiday,"Wonderful Stay, we booked a family room it was really clean,  comfy and spacious, with beautiful touches like a note from the manager photo attached and treats for the kids and to have a cuppa when we arrived! We booked the restaurant and a gorgeous lady took care of us (so sorry forgotten your name) but she was very kind caring and attentive, I was traveling with our special needs son and she was so kind ! It’s difficult for parents to travel with kids and one with medical needs is so stressful but it was so worth it , I immediately relaxed and we started our holiday , food was so good , I had salmon , my son had shepherds pie and other son had pizza and my husband had chicken with a beautiful sauce and off to bed early , and over to the airport in the middle of the night meant to had a few hours sleep before our early flight which set us up for the first day of our adventure! Thank you for accommodating us so well and for your kindness when I booked on the phone and for the lovely extra touches ;)  tip: book direct ;)",5,2022,11,19
245,Recommend,"Perfect environment to relax, very friendly and clean hotel. Staff upon checking in are also very polite and well mannered. Everything was held professionally and at the members best interest.Would stay again ",5,2022,11,15
245,Okay for one night..,Okay for a night. Kind of sloppy and not interested employees. One of the ladies at the front desk was friendly and welcoming. I stayed at an airport Holiday a couple days before in Lima of all places that was excellent! I’ve stayed with Blu before (on several occasions) and this was unfortunately a bit of a let down. Luckily only a night. ,3,2022,11,13
245,ok hotel,"the hotel is ok, just the room was a bit too noisy but it's very close to the airport Room clean, check-in and check-out was well done. It less than 10 minutes walking distance from the airport which makes it very convient if you arrive late during the day

245,OK stay. Shuttle info incorrect on site led to me walking to hotel in cold and wet conditions,"Shuttle info incorrect on site led to me walking to hotel in cold and wet conditions. Please update your terminal 1 shuttle location. Luckily hotel was 12 min walk from terminal 1. The shuttles don't go around as often, make sure to wait for shuttle 40 min than you think you need.

I was not able to use shuttle getting from and to airport from the hotel.

The staff was nice and helpful. ",4,2022,11,11
245,Good hotel but it needs better WiFi,"Overall, the hotel is very good the food is good value. However, it does have a few minor issues. The biggest issue is its WiFi. For the price of rooms and the type of hotel, the hotel must improve its WiFi. The other area is its lack of towels and very high charge for room service. ",4,2022,11,10
245,Great location and good service ,"Nice rooms and great location for the airport, service was friendly and it was very convenient for our trip away. Also a great hassle free checkout process, which is just what you need first thing. This is now our go to airport hotel if we have any early flights in the future. ",5,2022,11,09
245,Close to Dublin International airport.,"We stayed overnight as we had a early flight the next morning, hotel was recommended and the stay was great, eat in the restaurant which was really good and a great selection of gluten free, bed was comfy and room was clean with free shuttle to airport leaving every 15mins.",5,2022,11,06
245,Excellent customer service,"Booked following a canceled flight. Staff were amazing! They went out of there way to make sure we were comfortable and had what we needed, food, drinks and toiletries. Then the next morning they were helpful in answering questions for something to do besides Dublin city. ",5,2022,11,01
245,No lasting impressions. No value for money.,"Reception was not proactive. We were waiting at the lobby the entire time for our rooms and did not even inform us that they were ready. We only found out that rooms were available when we saw newly arrived guests being issued their keys ahead of us.

Food at the breakfast buffet were below average. For 18.50 per plate, we felt that we were robbed. Choose other hotels at the airport. Avoid this property if you can.",2,2022,10,31
245,"Fantastic hotel, great location, family friendly","Super clean, super comfy, kids loved the view of the planes going over from the huge window. Was easily accessible and quick to check in at 1.30am with two young kiddies. They also brought milk up to the room for my one year old to settle him off to sleep which was appreciated after a day of travelling. 

Nice staff and comfy beds. Will be our go to now when arriving late in dublin. Was slightly more expensive than some other hotels but easily worth it for the smooth experience and ease of parking and check in. ",5,2022,10,31
245,The kind staff save the day after my most exhausting trip,My booking was double booked so there was no room available upon arrival. The staff offered me a room in the sister hotel and gave me a free lift that night and following morning. It was Seamless service! ,5,2022,10,22
245,Don’t insult us with the take away so called breakfast ,"Perfect stay and dinner before heading off on a very early flight. Breakfast was offered as take away - waste of food - 2 slices of white bread with cheese and ham with tortillas thrown over. In bag all night - very poor for 242 euro rate 
The receptionist said it was fruit, pastries, juice! Would have loved that",3,2022,10,21
245,An oasis on a disastrous trip,"I was stranded in Dublin after 36 hours of delayed travel and ended up staying at the Radisson Blu because I could walk there from the airport.  Room was very nice, the restaurant was fully booked, but the bar served food and was comfortable to sit in by myself.  The staff, especially at the reception desk, are all very friendly.  It was a lovely stay and pretty much the only bright spot in what turned out to be a 3 day journey from Denver to Bordeaux.",5,2022,10,20
245,"Super convenient location for the airport, slept well, but a bit rough around the edges with the fitout","In light of the airport and flight chaos that has characterised flying as countries have reopened post- covid, I chose a ""be prepared"" approach to my travels home at the end of my Ireland travels, and accordingly stayed at the Radisson airport hotel the night before I flew home. This was despite the airport actually being relatively close to the city and my flight being scheduled for late morning.

I was busy in Dublin City until late at night, but I had no problems finding the hotel once I got to the airport, taking an easy walk between the airport and the hotel.

All fine then with checking in and finding my way to my room. Having checked in so late meant that I didn't really get a good impression of the exterior of the hotel and didn't think to turn around and have a look on my way out the following morning.

In the room, first impressions were positive, with dark timbers and leather? accents. On inspection, I found that the curtains crossed over in the middle and extended past the edge of the windows on both sides - a positive in my books for a good night's sleep to prevent excess external light from disturbing; especially here, with a room facing broadly eastwards. I was also happy to see USB charging outlets both by the bed and by the desk (in addition to the standard mains power outlets).

On closer inspection of the room, I am guessing that there has perhaps been a somewhat superficial facelift done at some stage, with, for example, some missing screw covers on fittings, an excessive amount of waterproofing behind the toilet, redrilled door locks where the old holes haven't been backfilled. There also seemed to be a regular amount of water running through the toilet - not audible enough to disturb, but visible. That said, none of these issues actually adversely impacted my night's sleep, which was ultimately the main reason I was staying here and not having another night at the previous hotel in the city.

245,Incompetent registration practices,"There was a clerical error made by a reservationist when I cancelled by phone a reservation for 10/4 and moved it to 10/3.  I checked out the morning of 10/4 and was given an invoice for 10/3.  When I arrived home and checked my AE charges I saw that they had charged me for both nights.  I have spent an absurd amount of time emailing with the hotel arguing the lack of common sense to no avail.  They repeat over and over again that they held the room and considered it a ""NO SHOW"" even though I checked out that morning.  I am a brand loyalist with Marriott and I have never experienced anything like this.  Don't stay at this hotel or at least don't try to get an obvious error corrected! I will never stay at a Radisson Hotel ever again!",1,2022,10,18
245,Close to airport,"I booked this hotel as it was the closest to the airport and the complimentary pick-up/drop off was a real bonus. The reception staff were very efficient and helpful. I found the bedroom's decor somewhat lacking, room didn't feel cosy, a bit dull, but I had a great night's sleep.",5,2022,10,18
245,Hotel has downgraded room experience,New flooring gives an industrial feel to the rooms rather than something warm and inviting.  They have substituted fake wood floors for carpeting.  They should have chosen a higher grade of fake wood flooring.,3,2022,10,13
245,Lovely hotel but let down by bar staff,"Clean, comfortable and spacious hotel. The bar staff spoiled the experience. Untrained, very poor english and poor service. Check in and check out was all top class as you'd expect from the Radisson hotel chain. Rooms are clean, spacious, modern and very comfortable. ",3,2022,10,13
245,Refusal to Refund Incorrect Credit Card Charge,"I had tried to make a reservation on this hotel's website for a date in July but it did not seem to go through as I never received a confirmation. I ended up not being able to go to Dublin (I wasn't able to choose the option of not staying on this site.)  About a month after my stay was going to happen, my credit card was charged by the hotel. I called and spoke with someone who promised to investigate but nothing has happened. I called again and left another message, sent emails and sent a ""snail mail"" letter to the manager but have heard nothing. I am very disappointed in their lack of response.",1,2022,10,12
245,Small observation that the side lamp on the night stand did not work,It looks like I just hit best excellent etc. I assure you that I read everything & did enjoy this hotel room at the same feel as the Hilton in Berlin so pleasantly surprised.The breakfast was well planned for streaming through buffet and was all beautifully presented! Thanks,5,2022,10,09
245,Lovely hotel,"Very nice room, clean and well appointed.  Great breakfast buffet.  Friendly desk staff who upgraded my room without question.  Shuttle to the airport was on time and very efficient.  Quick ride to the airport...only 5 minutes away.",5,2022,10,07

245,Overnight Stay Before an Early Flight,"Excellent airport hotel.

Efficient airport shuttle.
Comfortable room facilities.
Hotel was difficult to find by car.
Limited car parking on site.
Carpark filledup very early in the afternoon.",4,2022,10,04
245,Convenient to airport perfect for an early morning flight.,My only concern was how crazy the driver was taking us to the airport in the morning. Nice and helpful guy but his driving style was similar to Italian Grand Prix driver which at 6am in the morning and being within 3 mins driving distance seemed whole heartedly unnecessary. Needless to say we got to our terminal in half that time.  ,5,2022,10,04
245,Poor… better value in nearby hotels.,"Used Radisson for overnight stay for early flight from Dublin Airport. Check in staff pleasant & efficient. Standard room was old & dated. Bathroom was dirty, mirror covered in water marks; stains all over shower tiles & rust set in all around the bath panels. Ordered room service; €8 delivery charge which is extortionate. Grilled chicken Caesar salad… devoid of grilled chicken, a few pieces at the base of the salad bowl resembling sliced chicken from a deli. €207 for a night stay… Radisson… you need to do better. Much better value & higher standards in nearby hotels.",1,2022,10,03

245,"Clean and convenient, with one major mistake","This property is convenient to the airport and incredibly clean and in good condition, though sterile in its use of color in the rooms. I would recommend it without hesitation were it not for the 3am wakeup call that I received that I had not ordered. It was otherwise quiet and offers a great place to stay for early flights. Hopefully this was a one-time mistake. ",5,2022,09,26
245,Thoughtful rooms,"The hotel is an American style hotel for size of spaces and amenities.   I would never guess I was in Ireland based on the hotel.  The room was comfortable enough, though the double bed was disappointing, with a duvet too small for the duvet cover.  
The hotel provided a table of fruit and water.  The lobby had some lovely nooks for sitting and working or communicating.  Like most hotels here, not much opens until 7 or 7:30 though the breakfast place seemed to be open by 6:45 for seating. 
A shuttle bus runs to the airport every 20 mins but we were told to come early in case there was a wait for seating.  
Overall our short stay here was enjoyable.",5,2022,09,25
245,Best airport hotel,"I stayed with the family for 1 night and enjoyed both the quality of service at the restaurant for dinner and breakfast.
The food was excellent with great variety for both adults and children 
The service was excellent, friendly and customer focused.
I particularly liked the design of the restaurant with a fusion of both Irish and Scandinavian theme
Also a free shuttle bus is provided 
I will be back",5,2022,09,21
245,Poor service - rooms not cleaned/preadvised of this new policy - charged twice and still no refund for 3 nights stay!,"Shocking - their website charged me twice for my booking - three weeks in and no refund with countless calls and emails - I am going to have to get my credit card company involved - as frankly they do not care.
Rooms not cleaned unless you tell reception daily - however they did not preadvise me. Dirty coffee cups, no coffee pods, no fresh linen/towels",2,2022,09,21
245,Terrible stay overpriced - Couple stay 1 night,"Bad experience start to finish. Did not receive assistance with our luggage when getting on and getting off the shuttle bus, we had 4 large suitcases which he stood and watched us unload, in what I thought was not great service. Once arriving at the reception we were not offered any assistance with the luggages to take to the room even after them observing the struggle we were having with also carrying 2 carry on bags. Once we got to our room we noticed there were no ceiling lights, only the beside lights and 2 lamps, one of which was not working. The toilet was tiny and rust was observed around the bathtub and the glass screen for the shower was loose because the rubber gasket was falling off. The toilet did not flush after 2 uses/flushes. The nights sleep was not good, the room was too hot even with the thermostat set to the lowest temperature and the pillows were not comfortable and overall was a very broken night's sleep. In conclusion, we would not recommend this hotel as it was very overpriced for the quality we were provided. We will not be back again as there are better hotels for better prices and services.",2,2022,09,17
245,Ok hotel but needs some TLC.,"A great hotel close to T2 at Dublin airport. Room was good but the bathroom was missing the plug on the tap and there was a silverfish crawling around in the bath when I went for my morning shower. The water pressure was ok for the shower but I’ve been in hotels when the pressure is amazing. It’s a good hotel for a stop over but that’s about it. 
",4,2022,09,17

My room 202 had a door to the adjoining 204, which was not very sound proof (TV & laughter). I waited till 2300 to call the front desk, he was prompt to call #204 & they quieted the TV. Too bad those guests were not courteous untill being told.",4,2022,09,14
245,Cannot recommend this hotel at all,"40 minute wait for Bus - both time called said that it would be 10 minutes -NO apology at all in fact the receptionist was quite surely.
Done a pre- payment at reception- unfortunately it was not registered so had to pay by card for the extras 
Room was good - however, teaspoon was on the floor.
Went to the restaurant- waited for 10 minutes (behind another diner) without anyone coming to show us to a table.
So decided on the bar - no food served after 8 due to staff shortages 
Bar manager got us a booking at the restaurant though and the lady that served us (think was a manager) was really good - hence the one star.
Breakfast- I asked for poached eggs - after 15 minutes I gave up - they never turned up
One coffee machine was out of order - after waiting for the other to clear - now desperate for a coffee to go with my eggless breakfast- that machine also failed!
Really not worth staying here, my first experience with Radisson was not good - when the highlight is checking out and no one asks how was your stay is very telling- back to the Crowne Plaza next time",1,2022,09,14

I had to stay in Dublin for less that 24 hours, and I called the reception to ask for a plug adapter for one or two hours to recharge my IPad.
My company pays two rooms daily all year long, so we are an IMPORTANT LOYAL CUSTOMER.
The answer was : « Sure, we can sell you one at 10 € » !!!
This is shameful ! Shall I buy an adapter in every country where I have to spend a couple of hours for my job ?
I answered that this is not a good service to try to sell an adapter twice the market price for two hours usage, and new answer : « yes because when we provide adapters to our customers, they don’t return them » !
So I understand I am a presumed thief in your eyes ???
What an elegant way to treat your customers, huh ?
I believe there are means to recover your adapter, without selling it, and without considering that your customers are all thieves, you can just, for example, ask for an id, a deposit, a credit card reference, etc.
I’m very disappointed by this behavior in a « Radisson Blu » hotel.",3,2022,09,12
245,Wonderful Hotel & Great Staff,"Radisson Dublin Airport Hotel was warm and friendly, from start to finish. 
Check-in was quick and courteous. We attended a conference in the hotel, and enjoyed the fresh homemade cookies at the break-out session! Lunch was a buffet, and suited the group who could pick and chose their meal. This was quick and easy.
The hotel bedroom had a great view of the airport, and I particularly enjoyed watching the planes arriving and departing in the night sky. The bathrooms were recently renovated and the bed was exceptionally cosy!
Keep up the good work!   ",5,2022,09,09
245,Incredibly expensive hotel,"This hotel is incredibly expensive for whet you get. €300 room rate and if that wasn’t enough we had to pay €10 for parking and €18 for breakfast. When you are paying so much for a hotel room I would have thought that the parking would have been included. The breakfast was very average and not worth €18. The hotel feels cold especially at breakfast, we had a very average stay here. Very convenient to airport but that is the only recommendation.",2,2022,09,04
245,Great staff and fab sleep,"Shuttle pickup and drop off prompt and friendly. You can walk for sure

Check in professional but friendly

Rooms very nice. Dark. Quiet aircon that was also quiet

Great breakfast including omlettes and poached eggs cooked to order

Great experience",4,2022,09,03
245,Expensive. Couldn’t see difference between a superior and standard room.,"Might have been us being stupid but first time at Dublin airport and assumed the hotel was at the airport as others I’ve stayed in (eg. Stockholm airport Radisson) are. Couldn’t find any signage for the pick up bus so ended up pushing our luggage down the road to the hotel as we could see it! Unfortunately, they only had ‘superior’ rooms available when we booked but I couldn’t see the difference between that and an ordinary room. Very few bits for making a drink in your room and short of towels for a ‘superior’ room. It was clean and fine for an overnight stay,  but very pricey and won’t pay over the odds again but would just take a standard room.",3,2022,09,01
245,great for last minute airport stay,"We missed our flight out of Dublin (thanks Aer Lingus!) and this was the only place available. We were pleasantly surprised! very clean, quiet, and lots of gluten free food options for my celiac daughter. It pretty clean, and room service came pretty fast. The non-gluten free food was just so-so, but definitely better than staying the night in the airport.",3,2022,08,28
245,need better food in restaurant,"Food could be upgraded in restaurant.  it was not great. 
the rooms were comfortable 
staff in T3 bar not very attentive and it took a long time to get attention to get served.  we had two drinks but would have had three had the bar man not taken so long.  ",4,2022,08,23
245,Clean friendly and conveniently located,"Firebird Tours booked us in this hotel for the night in Galway Ireland.  It seemed brand new or recently remodeled.  Everything smelled new.  It was centrally located to shopping, restaurants, the bus station and the train station.  Being so close to the train station, I thought we would hear trains but we didn’t.  I would choose this hotel again.",5,2022,08,23
245,Location,Next to airport with shuttle.  Under renovation in public areas. Website should include details on shuttle pick up location and recommended walking route from both terminals. Checkin check out was done quickly.,4,2022,08,22
245,Close to airport of Dublin,"The shuttle we never have seen when we arrived. Waited more then 45 minutes. After that we took the conclusion to walk to the hotel together with a other cliënt.

In the morning was the shuttle full and so we did again the walk to the airport.",3,2022,08,19
245,Great hotel. So convenient to airport!,"Great hotel.lovely staff. Convenient to airport.only stayed one night and due to flights missed breakfast but staff happy to make a bag of snacks for us! 
Good meals. 
Easy to get to hotel from rental care drop off. ",5,2022,08,19
245,Modern Airporthotel,"We spend one night in the Radisson hotel because we had very early flight from Dublin the next day. It's a 8 min walk from hotel to Dublin Airport Terminal 2. 
We had a disapointing experience with the hotel restaurant. The steak was wrong done (done instead of medium) and the waiter was unpolite and arrogant.   ",4,2022,08,17
245,the end of a wonderful vacation - and more,"Great manager, great staff.  Nice building in the process of getting even better.  Best facility near the airport by a mile.  Elaine provided a great welcome and was always available for support which was important as spouse fell at airport and was unexpectedly in the hospital extending our stay in Ireland for a week.  With a lot to manage Elaine was a real positive presence in the 'home away from home'",5,2022,08,14
245,Wonderful!,"My flight was cancelled and I just chose a hotel at random from the hotel transfers at the airport! Just needed to stay one night. 

Philip, the gentleman driving the bus was very kind and welcoming. My room was upgraded to premium for free! Lovely food at the restaurant. Everyone on the staff was great. Can’t really fault anything.",5,2022,08,14
245,Stay at Radisson blu,"We got charged the wrong amount for our room and had to go back and correct it, being a gold member honestly does not get you anything that is advertised. We were a couple and got two single beds, even if we got a double bed we would have been happy ",2,2022,08,12
245,Avoid at all costs,"Don’t book here!

They gave away our room despite having booked months in advance and guaranteeing it with a credit card. We arrived at midnight (very tired 7 year old in tow), only to be told there must have been a ‘system error’ and they were fully booked. There was zero empathy or ownership of the issue by the duty manager Ushal, and ended up being walked. The duty manager even went so fas as to say it wasn’t their fault! Who’s fault was it then, mine??

I 100% believe their gave away our room and didn’t want to say this was the case.

I the end we were eventually put in a city centre hotel, by which time it was 1.30am, also meaning an even earlier start later that morning to go back to the airport.

Zero suggestion of compensation or discount despite the massive inconvenience, and seems to think he was doing us some kind of favour by matching the price for the Blu Royal as of our original booking.

Absolutely shocking customer service, and the attitude of Ushal the duty manager was a total disgrace.",1,2022,08,11
245,Great Airport Hotel,"Very good hotel to stay at when coming home from or going to Dublin Airport. Great location. Staff is very helpful when locating the shuffle bus outside the airport terminal. Rooms are lovely, clean and comfortable with complimentary bottles of water provided. Breakfast buffet was really nice and had a multiple options available. Would highly recommend!",5,2022,08,08
245,T&C Stay at Radisson Dublin Airport,"Lovely staff helpful efficient knowledgeable.
Restaurant staff were brilliant Dickson and Ricardo were just excellent with us we thoroughly enjoyed the food and the atmosphere created by your team. Would definitely start again thanks Team",5,2022,08,03
245,Perfect last night in Europe,"After a 40-day trip we stayed at the Radisson Blu on our last night to be close to the airport. The hotel was outstanding - personal check in was friendly, fast, and professional; the room spacious, clean, well equipped and pleasent to be in; the dinner menue much more than we had expected from an airport hotel; breakfast buffet was awesome and the service very attentive. Next time we'll start our European vacation here!",5,2022,08,01
245,Slight down turn,"We have been repeat customers at the Radisson Blu for years. We are usually thrilled with the experience but unfortunately this year we noticed a big difference in the cleanliness of the room, and there has been some bill discrepancies where we were double charges. The lobby is lovely and I know they are always trying to improve, it's just the cleanliness was definitely not what it used to be.",3,2022,08,01
245,Very Good Dublin Airport departure hotel,"Staff was excellent, helpful and friendly.  The room was superior. The hotel location was excellent for an overnight to get to the airport stress free for an early departure.  I would stay there again should I travel to or from Ireland.",5,2022,08,01
245,Good choice for airport stay,Efficient and clean and close to airport. Good breakfast and enjoyable dinner. Special thanks to Kim at reception for accommodating a last minute request and also to housekeeping for carrying it out. Hotel is surprisingly quiet for its location.,5,2022,08,01
245,"Hotel was fine, staff wasn’t great.","Booked due to proximity to hotel, but staff just wasn’t attentive or responsive. I requested water three separate times and never got it. Staff apologized and said they would make up for it, but again, no action. ",2,2022,07,23
245,A great airport hotel experience,"We spent our last night in Ireland at the Radisson at the airport so that we'd be ready to go for our flight home the next day.  The hotel is in the midst of renovations, although it seems as if they are nearly done.  Our room seemed brand new -- very modern, very comfortable, in perfect condition.  Air conditioning worked perfectly and double-paned windows kept things quiet.  The front desk staff were great and breakfast was very complete, with lots of staff to keep things orderly on the buffet.  We were able to walk to the terminal the evening we arrived to get information on how things were going for check-in (Dublin Airport has had some bad press about crowds, like most European airports) and we were also able to grab a luggage cart the next morning and walk to the terminal for our flight.  It was a very relaxing experience and we'd stay there again any time we were flying out of Dublin.",5,2022,07,22
245,Beautiful Property with Excellent Service,We spent the night unexpectedly in Dublin due to weather related issues delaying our departure from London.  The restaurant and bar were great.  We were just so happy and relieved to be sheltered after such a horrific day escaping London during a heat wave.  Staff members were professional and friendly.  The room was lovely.  I would stay here again.,5,2022,07,21
245,Review - Radisson Blu DUB,"Very convenient location, a brief walk from the Dublin airport. When I was there there was a lot of construction in the lobby, hence the lower eval for cleanliness, value, service. The staff were gracious and professional.",4,2022,07,20
245,Best Airport Hotel in Dublin,This is by far the best airport hotel in Dublin. Dining and bar are excellent. Very spacious lobby cafe area and the rooms are very modern and clean. Noise from aircraft is the only negative but this can’t be avoided,4,2022,07,19
245,Still tired after all these years,"Rooms are still as they always were, they were dated in 2015 and nothing looks to have been done.
A near monopoly at the airport doesn't mean you can forgot the impact on decisions where there is more choice",3,2022,07,15
245,Noisy do not expect a good nights sleep,"Hotel room was ok but the hotel is clearly old and when built did not invest in good sound proofing windows or since. You can clearly hear planes land all times of the night, delivery trucks reversing in , even people outside and i was on the top floor! I stayed in many airport hotels all close to the runway and never had the issues i had here because they put good sound proofing windows in. It was one thing after another woken 4 or 5 times. Will  not be returning.",1,2022,07,15
245,Dublin Airport Hotel,Good hotel with airport shuttle 24/7 every 20 mins. Or just 10 min walk. Just no outdoor space - but refurb happening so maybe that is one of the improvement areas? Overall good choice of hotel at airport,4,2022,07,13
245,Very Convenient and Top Notch,"We stayed here on our overnight layover from Edinburgh to DFW.  Of our 18 days in Ireland/Scotland, this was the best breakfast!  Lots of options of good quality and tasty.  Our room was a ""superior"" queen and offered lots of space.  Everything was very clean and updated (lobby is in the process of being updated, but it was never an issue).  Shuttle was great to take us back to the airport, but don't count on it when you arrive.  We tried to call for it and phone went unanswered.  That and the stoic attitude of the woman at check-in were our only disappointments (she was very helpful, but not once smiled).",5,2022,07,11
245,Overnight at the Radisson Blu,Hotel was very convenient to the Dublin airport.   I had a comfortable room and a good experience in the Collage dining room.  Check in was very easy and check out was even easier.  The shuttle to the airport in the morning was nice.  ,4,2022,07,10
245,Convenient Overnight Stop before Travel,"The Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport is a convenient place to spend the night before departing on an early morning flight.  While it is a bit distant from the center of Dublin, there are many pubs and an athletic facility nearby.  The hotel operates a convenient shuttle to the departure terminals and rental car facilities.",5,2022,07,09
245,Short walk from the airport,"The hotel was close to the airport (10-minute walk) and the area safe enough for my wife, mother and daughters (ages 6 & 8) to walk to the hotel from the airport. We booked a family room for not much more than a standard room. Restaurant prices were good, and the room with 3 beds was comfortable for 5 of us. The only negative aspect was a water leak from a next-door room made the floor damp in one of the corners that we avoided. ",5,2022,07,07
245,Adequate,"Clean, nice enough rooms however, can’t give it a good review and due to noise above us for about an hour in the middle of the night, we didn’t sleep. The night attendant said he had spoken to them but the noise continued. Bar food was expensive and not good and had to ask for knives and forks. Excellent in terms of distance to the airport. ",3,2022,07,06
245,Never sure about your booking,"When you book a room be sure to be on time or the staff will sell your room to someone else. 
You are never sure that they keep your room 
Some of the staff is friendly and try to support you but once the hotel is full yo are screwed. ",1,2022,07,02
245,"Overpriced, for what it was","I had a senior citizen room, I took a shower and flooded the entire floor, every time I had to use the washroom I was tramping around in a flood. I was in Ireland on a golf trip, and stayed a 1/2 a dozen hotels, and for the price per night, and what you actually got was night and day. I only need it as it was close to the airport, and a friend recommended it. Not impressed ",3,2022,06,29
245,"Big, clean rooms. Nothing else.","A well furnished, comfortable room.  The hotel was undergoing renovation, and Dublin was having some kind of record-breaking weekend for post-COVD tourism.  So that might explain why it was difficult to find staff, and those seen all looked exhausted.  
One of the restaurants never opened.   ",3,2022,06,28
245,Great overnight stay,"Due to airlines tweaking our flights, we booked here and it was very nice.  Opt for the top floor..lovely little restaurant to have a little late dinner…and in the morning they offered the best lattes I’ve ever had!",5,2022,06,28
245,Dreadful from start to finish,"The location of this hotel is why we booked as we were flying on to the US.
We arrived and checked in on Friday 24th June and the receptionist was very unhelpful and unhappy.  
We booked into our 4 rooms on the 2nd floor and the noise of drills and banging started almost immediately.  This was building works taking place on the ground floor and did not stop all weekend.  It woke us, we couldn’t relax in our room, it was ear splitting.
On the 2nd day, as the weather wasn’t great, we decided to find a quiet place to read our books in the hotel. Away from all the building noise.  When we returned to our room at 5 pm, it hadn’t been cleaned and neither had any of our Childrens rooms.  Our rooms weren’t cleaned the entire stay (2 nights) and we ran out of loo roll.
My daughter ordered room service that evening as she was so tired from the building noise but it didn’t arrive so we all ate in Collage which ok.  A very limited menu which is burgers - small, medium and large - chicken wings or pizza.  
The bartender accidentally knocked a pint of Guinness over me but apart from topping it up didn’t really apologise.
Breakfast was ok but there were no coffee cups on day 1 and we used takeaway cups.  The bacon could be cooked more.",1,2022,06,27
245,Nice Property but incomplete room furnishing.,The room was nice but for some reason (customs?) there were no chair for the table and no light other than the bed lights (not enough).  The staff did bring a very large chair after I complained but it was strange.   ,3,2022,06,26
245,Great location,"This was a family trip as a layover. The convenience of the location to the airport,  and shuttle were nice. The family style room was setup which was great. However,  construction noise was challenging,  and the rooms needed maintenance, with rust in the bathroom and missing carpet. ",3,2022,06,26
245,Modern and clean.,"The hotel offers free shuttle to the airport by a very helpful driver. 
We had a nice dinner in the evening, the rooms were pristine, and I loved the walk-in shower.  
Check- and check-out was efficient and stand were welcoming.  ",5,2022,06,25
245,Nice stay!,"I had a great stay here the night before my flight. The bed was comfortable, the blackout curtains were great, the rain showerhead was amazing, and they had a nice buffet breakfast. The staff were all friendly and helpful. It was a short walk from Terminal 2 (although they do have a shuttle), and I could see the terminal my room. Very convenient!",5,2022,06,25
245,Business trip,Business trave to Westport and one stop in Dublino for the night i noi ed with my colleagues from italy and as always we steppò in ireland  and the trip was booked through the company so we are always using radisson ,4,2022,06,25
245,Comfortable Stay.,"I have stayed here many times, it is an excellent location for catching an early morning flight as the shuttle service is excellent. The reception and dining staff are really welcoming and helpful. 
My room, as always was super clean and spacious. My only faults are for a five star hotel the shower room needs some attention. The height of the shower was impossible to adjust and the shower head just pointed in the one direction. There was just one tiny bar of soap and no shower hat. A minor complaint was that there were very few choices of television channels. 
The dining menu was ok but maybe add something like a vegetable stir fry or other vegetarian options. The Lamb Shank was served with a Bean Stew, i found this an odd combination, an addition of Rice or Couscous might have been more preferable. Not everyone is a lover of potatoes.",4,2022,06,23
245,biz trip,"Great location friendly staff nice clean hotel would recommend food slightly over priced for me rooms good standard Breakfast was very good toasters need updating unless you like warm bread 
overall good experience ",5,2022,06,20
245,Awesome place to stay!,The staff accommodated our early arrival and the room was beyond our expectations.  Use of computer to print our flight info.  Transportation to and from the airport with great service.  Would definitely stay here again.,5,2022,06,17
245,Its about the money to you all.  Not the people.,"The service sucked, the towels in my room were stained and had hair on a couple of them.  No breakfast provided for all the money.  I get breakfast for a $100.00 stay in America but can't get even a slice of toast for breakfast without paying.  Terrible stay",1,2022,06,17
245,Good location but poor service,"I use to go to this hotel since few years now anytime I am on business trip. It is well located, close to the airport. You can reach easily walking. The rooms are well designed and confortable. But during this week stay, the restaurant was surpirsingly closed without any notice on the hotel website I checked before arriving. As the hotel is in the middle of no-where, if you do not have a car, you are trapped and forced to go to the bar where a light menu is available. This menu is a safety wheel without anything to be highlighted. For breakfast, for the 2 times I went, ther was only 1 single coffee machine for all the customers. Prepare for queing time and empty dishes. Surprising for a hotel of that range. To summarize, great location if you have to take an early flight, confortable rooms but that's all. Maybe this is the case of most of the airport hotels.",3,2022,06,17
245,"Convenient, clean, courteous staff and good value",The entire staff was very friendly despite being understaffed. Room was spacious and very comfortable. Front desk and T3 Bar teams were courteous and helpful. Dining was limited to T3 due to private party but the team hustled to make it work. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2022,06,16
245,Total rip off.,"The hotel room cost a rip off 426 Euros for a single night. The room was small, the door lock didn’t work, the foot stool was broken. Coffee machine didn’t work.  Pillows were hard.  There was no room service until after 10:30 at night despite the fact that the in room literature said it was available 24x7.  I will not de staying in this dump again ",1,2022,06,13
245,Disappointed,"Not up to snuff for the Radisson Blue brand, which I have enjoyed in many other locations. They are charging a premium price here for a mediocre-at-best hotel. There were used towels in the bathroom of our room that the maids had obvioulsy missed, and the restaurant experience was a write-off—terrible choice, terrible understaffing, long wait to get in, long wait for food, and it arrived cold.",1,2022,06,02
245,Wonderful hotel,the supper dinning supervisor waited on our party of 12 family members and made a special effort to keep up togather even tough we arrived in stages for unplanned dinner. I ate alone earlh and the service and food was excellent..,5,2022,06,01
245,Radisson Blue Dublin Airport,"Excellent staff. Overall good hotel. Good, as in I would not blink at paying $200.00 per night. However $400.00 per night was exorbitant. Leaky shower and broken coffee machine. Again, not for $400.00. The restaurant was very good. I have stayed here several times and this last trip was my most disappointing. Again no fault to the staff. ",3,2022,06,01
245,Extended Stay,"On a recent trip around Ireland, I had planned to stay here one night at the tail end of my trip, but ended up extending my stay five more nights. Unfortunately, they could not extend my original price I had booked and ended up paying substantially more, probaboy due to availability of rooms and last minute booking. The staff at the front desk were exceptional. The breakfast buffet is very good, with a wide assortment of hot and cold offerings. The dinner menu is a bit limited, but has reasonable choices. At lunch, they only offered a buffet, so for those that may prefer a lighter lunch, you pay a premium. The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable, but during my stay, the cleaning staff never came by to replenish toiletries, or ask if I wanted clean towels. I had to take that upon myself. It is a great location to the airport, an easy walk if you don't want to utilize their free shuttle service.",4,2022,05,31
245,Wonderful Hotel Convenient to Airport,"We arrived back in the airport after midnight and were very glad we had booked an overnight stay in the Radisson.  Check-in was excellent. Our room was a premium room on the top floor and it was extremely well equipped, spotlessly clean and really comfortable. Needless to say we got a great night's sleep.
Our only slight quibble was with breakfast, there seemed to be a shortage of trained staff that morning, but that is understandable given the present problems with recruitment.  As a vegetarian when I reached the hot-buffet (about 8.15 in the morning) most of the vegetarian options were empty.  I had scrambled egg which was cooked to perfection and then had to go back later for tomatoes, mushrooms and hash-browns.  Perhaps I was just unfortunate but it seemed as if someone took their eye off the ball that morning.
The position of the tea / coffee station at the far-end of the dining room from the buffet was confusing several people - it would be helpful if this could be pointed out when you enter the dining room.
However, the food (when I got it) was so good it wouldn't put me off booking the Radisson next time I need an airport hotel in Dublin.
As a long time TripAdvisor reviewer I depend on TripAdvisor for advice on where to stay and where to eat when we are away from base.  If you found this review helpful I would appreciate your helpful vote.  I'm recommending a stay at the Radisson in Dublin Airport.",5,2022,05,26
245,$$$ not justified,"Use some of the crazy room charges to bring some much needed work on this property. One would think that a corp such as yours would agree with this. The charge for my two rooms on May 21, Saturday was cheaper than my one room on Wednesday the 25th of May. Go figure. ",2,2022,05,24
245,Delightful end to my business trip to Dublin,"I found this hotel warm and welcoming with friendly staff. The room was clean and modern, light and airy. We had a lovely dinner in the collage restaurant and a good night sleep before the early flight.",5,2022,05,24
245,"Convenient, Clean, Comfortable","We decided to spend our last night of a 17-day Irish O'dyssey at Radisson to avoid pre-flight rushing around the following day. We arrived from the Midlands a bit earlier than check in, hoping to just be able to drop off our luggage whilst returning the rental car. Imagine our pleasant surprise when we heard the words, ""your room is ready.""  

Such began an excellent experience that included smooth check in and a welcoming room 325.  Note:  if it's Irish scenery you are after hopefully you got an eyeful before here. Basically rooftops and venting pipes. 

But that does not detract from the overall convenience...and a superb meal at their Collage restaurant. It is obvious they ""have the market cornered"" when it comes to being the only real dining option. They could charge about any price; we thought 16 euros for a large pizza was more than fair. Kudos to Seamus for prompt seating and Nouchka for superior service. 

We recommend Radisson Blu to anyone desiring their final night on the Emerald Isle to be convenient, clean and comfortable.",5,2022,05,24
245,Awful customer service,"Myself and colleagues came to stay whilst on a course for work. We arrived at approximately 9pm and we were made out to not have paid for our rooms even though we paid what was confirmed in our confirmation email. They kept saying this was our fault although we had documentation of paying the correct amount. They made us wait for an hour and a half and we had to keep showing them the documentation and then after they finally allowed us to have our rooms, we were told that they did not have our booked twin rooms and they only had doubles, which is not ideal for colleagues. Really disappointed and will not be staying again. ",1,2022,05,20
245,The “Hospitality” Industry,"I believe this is the fifth time we’ve stayed at Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport. We checked in around 2pm Saturday, the 14th of May. The desk clerk was an extremely friendly, and courteous person. She asked us if we would require dinner reservations and we decided on 630 PM. We watched her write it down.   
 
We arrived at the Collage Restaurant at 630 and were greeted by I believe, Lilian (that name may be incorrect) who was unable to locate our reservation.  Ricardo then arrived at the desk and backed her up that there was indeed no reservation for us. I understand mistakes happen but how your staff handles those mistakes is what actually counts.  

We were finally seated with a haughty, and rude demeanor by Ricardo. We were not provided with menus. We took that time to discuss amongst ourselves our rude greeting and the diners seated next to us interrupted us to agree with what we were saying. 

 Finally, after a time, the waitstaff came to take our order and we informed her we’d not received menus as yet. She seemed very surprised and provided us with menus. We told her that we’d found Ricardo abrupt, rude,  unwelcoming and unprofessional. Lilians attitude was sadly not much better. 

I would take better care in who you have represent your the Collage restaurant at the front desk. I believe you may have the wrong people there at this time.",3,2022,05,14
245,Review,"Stayed here because of proximity to Airport, and the convenience, easy to walk to hotel from the airport terminal… I will stay here in the future for the same reason.  Restaurant was good for breakfast  ",4,2022,05,09
245,Very Unpleasant Experience,"Pre-covid, we stayed at this hotel several times.  The hotel's location near Terminal 2 is particularly helpful.  However, it is apparent that little maintenance has been performed for the last several years.  For example, the toilet would not flush properly (even after a maintenance call), the tub and shower are moldy, and the room desperately needs a good deep cleaning.   ",1,2022,05,09
245,Overnight stay at the start of our trip,"An early morning flight meant an overnight stay was a must.
We also needed an early breakfast and it all worked like clockwork.
We had a really lovely meal in the restaurant the night before and the waitress was friendly and efficient .. it didn't feel like a transit hotel but a lovely evening out.
The shuttle bus to the airport is every 10 -15 mins and while tge hotel is close enough to walk to the terminal,  this was a bonus!
All in all a good stay!",5,2022,05,09
245,Appalling customer service,"We were turned out after a booking error and told we had to pay over double what we had booked for. Our reservation was cancelled the night before and we weren’t notified. Manager did nothing to help, and felt like we were being extorted for money. Not a good way to rebuild your business after covid. Not a good way to treat repeat customers. Advise people to use other hotels at Dublin airport as the customer service here is terrible.",1,2022,05,08
245,Good but room for improvement,"I stayed here the day prior to a flight to the US.  Check in was fine and we encountered Leon initially, our room wasn’t ready but he advised it would be around an hour.
We had a coffee in the lounge and came back to obtain keys.
Our room seemed to be one that had been refurbished and was very nice, however, small things that are a custom to a 4 star standard hotel had been missing: ironing board and a hairdryer.
We had dinner in the hotel which was plentiful and tasted great, service however for a hotel of Radisson standard lacked, having to visit the bar to order food as well as drink.  Nonetheless Benjamin and Chloe who were on duty where courteous and pleasant and did the best they could.
Overall for convenience to T2 its great and no doubt once the refurb is done the hotel will be a true gem around the airport, they just need to beef up on service standard",4,2022,04,28
245,VERY disappointing stay! ,"Very disappointing stay at the Radisson Dublin Airport Hotel.
We have been using this Hotel for years, as we fly regularly to Australia and other parts of the world from Dublin Airport, and always had cheerful greeting at reception and nice CLEAN comfortable room, well my goodness,  how that has all changed.  What has happened to this Hotel? it has totally gone downhill,  starting with the not so friendly reception staff and..disgusting dirty room. Used bathroom tissue behind loo, and someone's medication pill under the pull out bed ( which was not needed, so don't know why it was out taking up so much room, we had booked a double! )
Major MAJOR improvements need to be implemented IMMEDIATELY. especially on the Health & Safety aspect! And yes, we understand that they are renovating but that doesn't excuse a dirty room, and unfriendly Reception staff! 
On a positive note, the lovely  "" FRIENDLY "" Andrea in the restaurant made our stay that bit better, Reception should take a leaf out of her book, a lovely down to earth smiley girl..thank you Andrea.",1,2022,04,27
245,Dreadful place,"Stayed  here one night in April 2022.

For:  
           proximity to airport.  
           Driver of courtesy bus was friendly and professional. 

Against:  
                   Cold, unwelcoming foyer  
                    Reception staff did not make me feel welcome and went through the 
                    booking in a  robotic manner.
                    Room was adequate and clean. Pillows were rock hard and duvet 
                    unsuitable for room temperature leading to a hot, sleepless night.
                    Restaurant was quite obviously seriously understaffed. I was told they 
                   were having difficulty in recruiting  new staff (maybe pay better wages ? )
                   The food, when it eventually arrived, was poor quality and meagre 
                   portioned.
                   The overnight stay was extremely highly overpriced and very poor value 
                   for money.
                   I know, from past experience, there are better quality, and value places, a 
                   short taxi ride away.",1,2022,04,19
245,Friendly welcome,"The reception area was being decorated so first impressions of the hotel were not as good as I have experienced in the past at Radisson hotels. However the staff's friendly welcome made up for it. My room was large and spacious  but  needed updating. The  bed was very comfortable and I slept well. Good breakfast with plenty of choice. Friendly and hard working staff.
",4,2022,04,17
245,"Great stay, only issue was parking fees","great suite, clean, heated bathroom floor all great. The only issue was the parking fees.  In the end we payed double the parking charges, all because we went out to dinner in the evening, we were told by the front desk personnel that because the parking employees were no longer on site, we would have to pay 7.50E for 3 hours and then another 9E for the nights daily rate.  the front desk should be able to handle all these matters",4,2022,04,16
245,No class,"I was there on April 13 th 
I was in Ireland looking at properties I stayed in your hotel and was seriously dissatisfied with the way I found the bathroom with a towel tied around the shower head to prevent the water from spraying all over the place and finding CO2 cartridges in the room when I went to take down a towel showed that the towels hadn’t been  changed since your last guest stayed there ",2,2022,04,15
245,Find Another Place To Stay,"$310.00 Euro for a premium room ?  Nothing ""premium"" other than the tittle the hotel gives it.  Bedding and towels had NOT been washed prior to our arrival..... I mean the were still ""new with tags"" on them.  Very uncomfortable and rooms are very uninviting.  Total rip off .... except location is convenient for early flights.",1,2022,04,13
245,Very basic,"I wasn’t looking for an incredibly lively bar, but T3 was so quiet we were conscious of speaking to each other. I ended up making a casual remark to the barman about it and he then turned on sport. The beds are also particularly tiny.",2,2022,04,13
245,Service Above and Beyond,"The hotel was excellent - our room and food service was great! But the above and beyond came when my daughter and I had to do our preflight covid testing at the airport!  The shuttle driver took us right to the testing center and waited while we did our testing, then took us to the terminal as we tried to check our bags early without success.  Then when my test results failed to arrive via email, the shuttle driver took us back to the testing center before it closed so I could secure my results for an early flight to US the next morning!  The savings in taxi or bus fares for three trips to airport was worth staying there alone! Everyone was helpful and friendly with great advice about navigating the busy airport lines!  I appreciate the great service and will recommend this hotel to everyone going to Dublin!",5,2022,04,11
245,"Wrong room type given, service to fix not good. Rooms were not what was reserved 2 rooms each with 2 twin beds - what we",Rooms were not what was reserved 2 rooms each with 2 twin beds - what we got were 2 rooms each with 1 full size bed. This was for 4 single women. It was partially resolved with one room being changed to the 2 single beds but they would not fix the other without us paying full price for a different room. Very unhappy with the experience. Then the room with the full size bed was also given to another customer who entered the room at 10pm when we were in bed. ,3,2022,04,11
245,"Well run, well furbished, well situated and very customer oriented","Staying at Raddison Blu airport hotel Dublin is always a very efficient when arriving late for meetings in Dublin the next morning. The shuttle service, the adequacy of check-in and -out and the quality of the rooms, bed and bathrooms are those important elements that make exhaustive travelling a bit more relaxed.",5,2022,04,09
245,Way Overpriced,Stayed here for one night to catch an early morning flight the following day. From the moment I stepped inside it felt cold and unwelcoming. I had paid €173 for the convenience and was so let down. Staff were not attentive in any way. My room was so cold and bathroom was so in need of a facelift.  Staff in the bar seemed to either hate their job or had never been trained in customer service.  They just seemed to turn their back and never made eye contact. Hotel bar was dirty and cold also and food was not worth rating. I can safely say it's my first and last time staying in a Radisson ,1,2022,04,08
245,"Excellent location, food and service","We had an overnight stay prior to an early morning flight. A great hotel, comfortable, clean and quiet.
Dinner was excellent - especially the lime and coriander prawns!
Breakfast was better than in many ‘bigger and better’ hotels. ",5,2022,04,07
245,Watch Out,"Be careful what room they put you in. They have old rooms with no standard electrical connections, so you wont be able to plug your phone, computer etc
My wife stay at this hotel one night and the room was modern an updated. Her flight was cancelled and she needed to stay another night. They put her in an older room with not operable (old style) electrical outlets.
When she complained and ask them for some kind of electrical adaptor, they tell you they sell them at the airport. No help at all.
After that she told them to change the room for her, to what they told her that all room were the same and that all rooms were occupied.
One fast check in the net told her that they were not.
When she confronted them, they found a empty room with a 40 Euro overcharged. My wife took it, paid the money and was assigned to a 5th floor room. Basically same room but updated.
By the way. the room was 40 euros more expensive than the same room she was the night before.
Be aware of these people.",2,2022,04,06
245,Rooms Dated,"Rooms very dated , needs to be totally revamped . Staff very friendly and helpful , prices very high for what you are getting . Food average in bar , receptionist was excellent .  Cark park best thing about hotel .  ",3,2022,04,06
245,Very poor room.,"One night stay, that was enough. Room had the feel of a covid isolation room and I could not have handled 10 days in there! Bare minimum of everything. Thin plastic cups with the kettle, hardly any tea or coffee. Horrific headboard that was just a slat of wood coming down from the wall at a 45 degree angle. Had to pull a piece of furniture away from the wall to retrieve something I'd dropped and found several small items (pens, kinder egg, tea bags) from previous residents along with a glut of dust. Miserable, I went to the bar, the red wine was poured unskilfully so when I tipped the glass with a sopping base it covered my new jumper. Headed to the lounge for some respite but couldn't hear myself think for the drilling going on. Will not stay here again. Hopefully it will have been revamped when you visit.",2,2022,04,05
245,In and out,We stayed at the Radisson for a short visit to Dublin. Prices were half the price of hotels in the city and since we were only to spend one night this seemed logic. The hotel is fine. Good rooms and nice beds and the price-quality rate is much beter than in the city itself,4,2022,04,04
245,Still suffering from the covid blues.,"My gosh it’s gone down a bit, used to be premiere, not so much now. I think the management has changed, not for the better. Hotel been hit hard with covid , refurb work going on so decor will improve let’s hope the rest will follow.
Bar service is below the normal Irish standard.
Maybe I got a bad one.",3,2022,04,02
245,Flying Visit,"Stayed in a junior suite, lacking some items ie: robe, slippers. Air con very noisey. Breakfast no staff, walked right into restaurant dirty tables, no milk, dirty cups on table a bit of a let down to be honest. ",5,2022,03,31
245,Excellent,Staff very friendly Joanne very much a peoples person. Great personality and very helpful.  Stay too short. I think there should be a reduction in price for  frequent  guests. Other than that all  very good.,4,2022,03,31
245,Short stay before flight,The room was not clean. Went to have a coffee in the morning the coffee mugs and spoons had not been changed from last guest and were not clean. We told this to the person on front desk at check-out who said that the cleaning staff sometimes miss these things... Will not be staying here again before a flight.,1,2022,03,29
245,Nice hotel conveniently located within walking distance of the Airport. Outstanding restaurant food.,Excellent food in the restaurant...outstanding in fact with pleasant staff. Only downside was person in next room who complained about noise from the TV which was set at only 15/100 volume! Modern clean and comfy room - a tad on the pricy side for an airport location.,4,2022,03,28
245,Rooms need to be completly remodeled,"Lobby and restaurants OK. Close to airport free shuttle. Old, worn and broken furniture in rooms. Toilet had to be fixed. Rust in bathroom from shower door. 5 year old must have calked and painted room. ",1,2022,03,26
245,Convenient airport location,"I stayed 1 night before the day of my flight so I could do Covid test a day ahead. 

Although the location of the hotel was walkable to the airport, there was always a shuttle in front to take guests to the airport.

The shuttle drove me to the Covid test center and even waited for me to take me back after the test. I really appreciated that service.

The restaurant was convenient for dinner. 

The room was very clean although it was a little bit dated. For a short stay it was alright.",4,2022,03,18
245,Work Meetings,"A 2-day work training event last week at this hotel. The rooms were fab, the buffet lunches were great, and all the staff were so helpful. We were given a big spacious meeting room as there were 22 of us and a couple of staff joining online - the AV equipment was perfect the online staff could pick up every voice in the room. I highly recommend this location for business meetings and training due to its great service and the proximity to the airport.",5,2022,03,14
245,Great for a stay close to airport,We stayed here as we had an early flight out the next morning.  They have a 24 hour complimentary shuttle to terminal which was greatly apricated on a very cold morning.  Bar and restaurant we fine also.,4,2022,03,07
245,Convenient for Dublin airport,"This is an airport hotel. I arrived at terminal 1 and on exiting, walked 10 minutes and got to the hotel. It was fairly easy to find.
Check in was quick.
Room was large and clean.
Downsides:
1. Temperature of the water in the shower was not high enough even at the highest setting.
2. The layout of the bathroom sink is poor without much room.
3. The trash/rubbish bin bag is poor quality. I would suggest management goes into any of their room and places a used tea bag in any of the bins in their rooms - the problem will be obvious. This is not what you would expect when you charge the amount this Radisson does.
4. If you do not have to get up very early, I suggest you ask for a room facing away from the airport. Considering the distance from the airport, you get noise from the aircraft which suggests that the double glazing is not as good as other airport hotels where even those in the airport itself (eg Brussels Sheraton) are silent. 
Would I stay here again? Yes if I was catching an early morning flight. The convenience is hard to beat.",4,2022,03,07
245,Could and should do better for the price tag,"This is a fairly new hotel in the grounds of Dublin Airport and to be honest that’s where the good news ends . The hotel just needs a bit of TLC . The desk in the room was damaged .The table in the room looked  like
It had been in a school for a few years .Not sure what the policy is on bathroom plugs but neither the bath or sink were connected . All small stuff but that’s what makes the difference .Warm orange juice and warm milk !!! I wouldn’t have thought it was hard to get something to keep the drinks cold. Could and should do better",3,2022,03,06
245,Good to be back after an enforced absence,"It was so good to be back after an enforced absence due to the pandemic. As ever, staff were professional and friendly.

I had dinner in the restaurant, and while the menu has changed (less high-end) the food was cooked very well and I enjoyed it.

There were aspects of the room that were disappointing: the wifi signal didn't reach it, the USB ports were broken and the range of TV channels was limited. Here's hoping that business will pick up enough this year for them to be able to invest in infrastructure.

I'm very grateful that the signal in the lobby was strong, and also that I was able to print at no charge from the computer there. I hope to be back.",4,2022,03,03
245,Hotel review,I enjoyed my trip to this hotel and would highly recommend it the hotel staff were very helpful and the food in the restaurant was out of this world very tasty would definitely stay in this hotel again ,5,2022,03,02
245,Lovely staff,"I was having a really terrible day having missed my flight and I needed to stay t the airport, it was quite late, there were two receptionists that helped me get booked in and organised a wake up all for me, one had glasses and the other was called Ashley I believe, they were very helpful and I was very happy with the room that they got me! Thank you very much Radisson blu team! Great customer service",5,2022,02,24
245,"Expensive, not worth the money ","Basic, run down and expensive. 
Not sure if the barman ripped me off, but two double Tanqueray and a mixer was 31.90 EUR.
Breakfast was average, 37 EUR for two people.

Definitely won't be back and would not recommend. 
Radisson is obviously not the same hotel that I used on a regular basis before covid, or maybe it's just the Dublin Airport Hotel that isn't worth the money. Find somewhere else to stay!",1,2022,02,12
245,lovely hotel,"Excellent customer service from staff both at the reception and in the kitchen. Very comfortable bed and spacious room. Very clean. I will definitely be using again. It was a solo travel - so close to the airport. Immediately I called from the arrival lounge, the transfer shuttle came in 5mins. Very courteous gentleman who opened the door and insist on helping put my hand luggage in the boot.",5,2022,02,11
245,No sleep to be had at this hotel,"Kids left unsupervised kept running around the corridors screaming and shouting and knocking on random doors for hours on end until between 1 and 2 in the morning. Only to be replaced by the singing of their unsupervised parents. 
Hotel staff did nothing to stop any of this. 

I stayed at the hotel as I had an early morning flight and wanted to get some good sleep before flying out. Managed to get maybe 3 hours thanks to hotel staff not having the sense to intervene with unruly kids and their parents.",1,2022,02,07
245,Radission Bar is a Joke,"Was there last night went to meet some friends for few drinks. The worse bar service I’ve ever seen. Took 30min to get a drink. The bar ran out of Heineken and also ran out of Bulmers crazy. 
Will never again be back such poor service. We had to move in the end to the Maldron across the road where they actually had drinks available and staff.",1,2022,02,06
245,Great experience over all.,"Nice hotel,great for the airport just 5 mins walk,they also have a shuttle.Very polite and efficient staff.I stayed here a few times before Covid,but I have to say the food has improved 100%.Had beautiful Broccoli Soup with brown bread in the afternoon and then in the evening I had ceaser salad,followed by Lamb shank and Toblerone tartlet and all was wonderful.Lovely welcome from reception and got upgraded and also great service in the restaurant with an efficient,professional, engaging waiter Eli. Keep it up everyone, it's the people that make a place.",4,2022,01,28
245,Good value with breakfast,"There's a shuttle service (if you can find it - since the instructions issued by the hotel are totally bewildering. No-one to help you to find anything at the airport, you have to have ESP.) 
Breakfast is very good.
Pity about the room: Freezing. 
After my shower I discovered that the bath towel provided was used!! Had to request a clean one!!!",3,2022,01,25
245,Temperature in room low cannot be charged,"Beer in café good, pizza looked loke a doktor Oetger taken from the frezer, not good for the price
Price on room ok
Room nice and clean 
Coffee in the room works ok, good choices
Restaurant food good good reservation of table in the check in process",3,2022,01,23
245,One night after flight,"Room felt much less than 4*, bathroom very small. Everything very clean but outdated. Breakfast was excellent! Facilities for parking were really good, the location relative to the airport spot on. Overall it was good experience except for the price which seemed way too high.",3,2022,01,21
245,Wonderful,This is way more than just a plastic airport hotel ! Why you may ask ? The answer is apart cleanliness comfort and great food …. the people ! Amelia Silvia and Leon were so welcoming and helpful … Patrick ensured my airport run was sorted with charm and efficiency and Martina added to a very lovely warm atmosphere over an excellent dinner . They like so many other staff are simply hospitality stars. In difficult times they are frontline and my how superb they are .. thank you all . I’ll be back soon !,5,2022,01,20
245,Very good,"Very nice hotel with good service. Overall cleanliness was good, no problem to get a taxi or any other service you would possibly need nearby an airport. Receptionist Silva speaks fluently several languages!",5,2022,01,15
245,Great location,"Tidy, comfortable hotel. Spacious, clean room with excellent bed.  The breakfast buffet has an abundance of choice, all of which were very tasty.  The only disappointment which was communicated ahead of time, was the lack of shuttle service from the airport due to staffing shortages. Short walk to COVID testing site in airport parking lot made travel clearance very easy.",4,2022,01,12
245,Stay,Excellent service and friendly staff plus the rooms where in tiptop condition plus the meals were excellent and plentiful I would recommend the hotel to friends and family whenever they want to stopover for a flight ,5,2022,01,11
245,Nice stay,"The hotel I choose to stay before I get in the airplane. The reception staff is very nice and helpful, specially Silvya. 

For breakfast I would prefer  a bigger variety. In Radisson Blue from Bucharest, for example you have a chef that is cooking the omlet in front of you. Here I had as an option only the buffet (or if I had extra options I did not know about them) and also the croissants were like a rock.

I asked one of the waiters where is the coffee machine. She seemed a bit annoyed that I did not observed it by myself. But I guess we all have bad mornings sometimes.

However, radisson by the airport will always be my choice before my trips. It s a very nice place. ",5,2022,01,10
245,Good hotel for airport but.......,"Had an unfortunate experience where I paid for a premium family room, which can accommodate three adults, but was given a premium regular room with only one bed. It took the best part on an hour to get a regular facility room. I am assuming other guests got bumped because their possessions were still in the fridge. I thank the manager for acting on the problem, but was disappointed that it arose. Extractor in bathroom not working. ",4,2022,01,09
245,Inadequate room,"Have stayed in the past and have had a good experience, however this time round the room very old, bathroom fixtures were rusted out, no safe in room and corridor smelt of smoke.
Requested a room change but could not be accommodated. ",2,2022,01,08
245,Overnight stay,Superb.  We were collected from airport terminal. and returned by courtesy bus.  The check in process was quick and easy and the bedroom bigger than we expected.  Evening dinner and breakfast first class.,5,2022,01,08
245,Outstanding customer service,"I arrived into Dublin from a long haul flight on Monday morning and due to an unfortunate change in circumstances instead of making my journey home up North I needed to stay the night. It was early morning so I realised check in wouldn’t be until afternoon. 

I arrived at the hotel and the lady on reception (I didn’t get her name) was absolutely phenomenal from start to finish. She gave me early check in and whilst we waited on our room gave us water and sent us for a coffee free of charge . This was so appreciated after 24 hours travelling. 

My son wanted breakfast and again the staff in the restaurant were so friendly and lovely , they couldn’t do enough. 

We went straight up to our room afterwards which was beautiful (5th floor). Fridge , amenities and everything you need. Dinner that evening in the bar was also fantastic and again the staff esp the lady who served us (possibly the manager ) was so attentive to us and also the other guests. 

Would highly recommend, from start to finish our stay although short couldn’t have been better. 

Your staff are a credit to your hotel!",5,2022,01,06
245,Convenient but Terrible,"If you need quick access to the airport in Dublin and don't want ice, dependable room service, a clean room, clean towels, a working coffee machine, an organized shuttle system to the airport, a decent restaurant with good food, or responsive staff - then this is the hotel for you!",1,2022,01,05
245,Not so covid safe.,"Its not the best sight to see and very worrying when your boarding a international flight the next day when your check in guy is not wearing a mask, coughing in to his hands and handling your belongings.

Also room looked very rushed when cleaned and food was below par.

Thank you.",2,2022,01,02
245,Free shuttle to the Airport,"Great hotel 2 - 3 mins from the Airport.  We had an early morning flight and this hotels location was perfect.  Due to Covid restrictions, food choices are extremely limited, but what they had was good.  Bar was open which is important.  Rooms are a bit worn, but the bed was comfy and the rooms/bathrooms were super clean!",4,2022,01,01
245,Mr b koldhar,"Sucks horrible I don't like it, bad experiences overall, willl never stay with you guys again,I really had a bad time, stafff was racist, I hate being Indian as this help with my mental health or anxiety",1,2021,12,31
245,Terrible stay,"Room was a fire hazard as the door handle fell off on the inside making it difficult to exit and this wasn't rectified after telling reception, promised to open the door to the adjoining room where our daughters were staying at our suggestion so we could make a quick exit in the event of a fire,that never happened.
Mixed up 3 of the 4 items ordered through room service.
Wind howling through the vents in the windows that could not be shut.
Shower was dreadful and only a trickle of water and one towel between 2.
Room cleaning staff didn't wear masks at the height of Omicron and many hand sanitising stations were empty.
Avoid a all costs",1,2021,12,30
245,A disappointing end to a lovely family Christmas spent in Ireland,"I spent the Christmas period with my family in Ireland and on my return to Nice France I spent one night at the hotel before catching my flight back to France. I normally stay here as it is very convenient being so close to the airport. When i arrived to the room, except for the bathroom there was no lighting. we stood in the bathroom for 15 minutes until housekeeping arrive  and then a further 10 minutes until we were given another room. the furniture in the room was very old and not up to standard. in my previous visits over many years the rooms that we were given were of a higher quality.
",2,2021,12,30
245,Friends night out.,"Was 
only there for one night staff were lovely and friendly and helpful.
The hotel room was perfect for the three of us as we were just having a night off . We had a lovely evening was nice to be able to chill",5,2021,12,19
245,Dec 2021,Overall I had a nice experience. Staff and Restaurant staff and  food  lovely. Comfortable bed and a great night's sleep. It would have been much better if the room and bathroom hadn't of been so in need of updating. ,3,2021,12,12
245,Staying Over,"We were heading to USA to see family (first time in 2 years) This seemed to just be hassle after hassle, tests etc.So we decided to travel down from belfast to Dublin airport the night before to relax a bit and to get yet another test . Great decision, hotel is very close and there is a shuttle bus. Had a lovely meal and nights sleep. The staff were great, NO hassle !! A great decision ",5,2021,12,07
245,Freezing room with hardwood floors and no slippers. Unprofessional check-in process. Friendly staff,"Freezing room with noisy, but effective heater. Once turned off, the room reverts to freezing in 10 minutes. Paper thin walls with wall-mounted TV means you will hear every word of whatever your neighbouring room is listening to. Despite asking for a room away from the elevator, they put me in a room BESIDE the elevator (very noisy). A cynical exercise to cluster guest around the elevator to make cleaning cheaper. No slippers. No ""Do not disturb"" sign. Very friendly staff, but they ignored the one simple and easy request I made, so that doesn't inspire confidence. And at 200 euro, it was WAY overpriced. A cheaply built hotel that isn't even run by Radisson. They've outsourced it to a management company, so zero brand value visible here ( I wasn't even asked if I was a Radisson member or not, or whether I'd like to become one )",1,2021,12,06
245,Very comfortable hotel and stunning restaurant,"The hotel is located just next to the airport and the shuttle service works 24h, so it's very handy for early flights. The room was comfortable and spacious, I was just a bit disappointed about the size and the quality of the bathroom.
The most amazing feature is the hotel restaurant, it had an amazing style and the food was delicious! 
Overall, I really recommend staying at Radisson Blu for the location, the service and the comfort.",4,2021,12,06
245,Bad food and staff took ages to sort out problems,"Got into our room late, went to get into the shower and it was hanging off the room. Rand reception which they said they would move us rooms, it took them half an hour to come up with the new room key. We then ordered a pizza which took 45 mins to be made. When collected I bit into it and found a very large bone in the middle of the pizza. They only refunded the money for the pizza and no compensation was offered despite being awake to half 2 in the morning due to the hotels mistakes and we had to get up for a flight at 6",2,2021,12,05
245,A shadow of its former self.  Avoid,"This used to be our ""go-to"" hotel when visiting family in Dublin.  Not sure I'd risk it again.  Where do I start?  We arrived early (too early), spent money in restaurant and bar and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Eventually, we were getting close to having to leave for a funeral wake and we still had no room.  No room, no chance to shower, change and get ready.  Official check-in time cam and went.  Nothing, despite many pleas at reception.  Apparently, there were ""too many late checkouts"" from the night before.  At what point is that my problem?  The hotel should manage this.  So we left, unprepared, for our wake.  The mad irony was, that when we returned  and checked into our room, the shower didn't work anyway, so that would have been no use anyway.  But it gets worse.  We were (hopefully, because I can't believe this was normal) we had the worst room in the hotel.  Large and sparsely furnished, the curtains were hanging off the rail.  The bed was a strange fold down guest bed affair.  A draughty hole in the window frame was taped.  Any attempts to complain the reception were largely thwarted by the phone being unusable as somebody had removed all of the information and details from it.  And the shower only ran cold.  Great!  Well, according to the receptionist ""you have booked a standard room"".  There were other gripes from the visit that are too numerous to list here, but the summary is shocking room and appalling service, all for 135 euro. Anything positive?  Breakfast was fine, and shuttle driver was friendly.  Cant think of anything else positive.  Even the follow-up email from the absent manager was half-hearted.",2,2021,12,05
245,Great Stay,"Used the hotel as I was on an early flight the next day. This wasn’t my first time staying and the stay was excellent . From the moment we arrived it was all good. Friendly staff, clean room.
Highly recommended ",5,2021,12,02
245,Great overnight stay at Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport,Very Clean and comfortable room . Staff were very friendly . Bar and food were both excellent . Would definetly stay here again when in Dublin . Great location for next morning connecting flights . Only recommendation would be to include shuttle-bus pick-up location in confirmation email .,5,2021,12,01
245,Excellent location,"The hotel is old fashioned and furnitures are very old which I can even want to use the mini fridge. The money is only paid for the location and friendly staff. 
Besides, there was a manager on the floor we stayed and sounds quite rude and ask us where we are going. I was with a baby and a toddler which my little boy just exploring the place and look for our room. Her voice and tune are not polite at all. Other than this, all other frontline staff are extremely friendly and helpful.
By the way, the mattress are excellent.
May try another hotels next time.",3,2021,11,30
245,Very poor room standards,"Very poor room standard, especially bathroom.  I wouldn't pay even 50 euros for this room . Very poor service at the bar, zero professionally.  Terrible breakfast service. I will never stay in this hotel.",1,2021,11,29
245,Airport Hotel stay,Good enough stay but way to pricey for what is worth. We arrived late at night from a flight and decided to sleep over to recharge bateries for the rest of the journey next day. The room was cold and the windows were old and badly isolated so we could hear and feel the draft coming in.,3,2021,11,29
245,Love this hotel for airport stayovers,The carpet under the table in the room was not vacummed! Otherwise loved the room and slept great. It is a most comfortable bed. Great reception team. I have stayed here a few times and have always enjoyed it ,5,2021,11,20
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport,"I stayed 4 nights on the second floor and the room did not meet the standards I have come to expect from a Radisson Blu hotel. The room furniture looked drab, the shower was just about hanging on, and the bathroom tiles near the bath had signs of black mould. The restaurant staff refused to bring a pint of Heineken for me during dinner, but they would bring back a pint of Guinness for my colleague (both from the bar). 
 ",2,2021,11,20
245,Good,"Have stayed here a few times very well organised especially traveling nice clean rooms nice bar restaurant all good. A good place while traveling to stop over at Dublin airport, rooms clean all run smoothly checking in the bar is nice for a bite to eat.",5,2021,11,19
245,Horrible place - never again,"Far below low cost hotel. Very old furniture, bathroom was falling appart. Specifically chose this place because of my membership with Radisson , but I should have chose another hotel brand if I knew how bad is this place. ",1,2021,11,15
245,Very poor.,Booked a suite even though my daughter and I were only staying overnight for an early morning flight. The double bed was tiny. The bathroom was tired and worn with a chipped bath. The bath was chipped because the tap kept falling off and chipping the bath! The toilet seat was broken. The bathroom was clearly not properly cleaned. We were in room 322. Poor value for money. If this was a suite I'd hate to stay in a regular room. Never again.,1,2021,11,08
245,"Very comfy beds, good nights sleep","Great nights sleep, bed was so comfy. Duvet was also so comfy. Bathroom needs some updating but it was clean. Check in could be long if you arrive at wrong moment  I was lucky. Overall a good option at the airport to stay. It is less than 10 mins walk or the lovely shuttle man will take you.",4,2021,11,08
245,A Convenient Stay Under Inconvenient Circumstances,"I was meant to fly back to USA, but didn't realize I needed a negative Covid test until I was at the airport. My flight was moved to the next day and I stayed here. Staying here was very convenient - good food, comfortable rooms, etc.",5,2021,11,07
245,Not the Same Hotel !!,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel many years ago when I gave it 5 stars. NOT THIS TIME !! We stayed here in October, 2021 on two different occasions because it is so close to the Airport Terminals. Don't let the staff try to upgrade you to a Superior room for more money. The Standard room is better with more desk area and just as big. We had to go down to the front desk on at least 4 occasions to get new electronic keys to open the door to our room. One time, I collapsed onto the hallway floor while waiting for my wife to retrieve a new key and at least three guests walked over me, not even asking if I needed help. My wife finally came back to help me. The second time we stayed there in October the computer in the lobby didn't work which we needed. We also brought our own clothes hangers. No place to put our suitcases. No one was enforcing COVID rules. Guests were not wearing masks in the lobby, elevators or hallways. We felt very unsafe

On a positive note, the Standard room was large with a sofa and coffee table. Great mattress and duvet on the bed. There was a heated towel rack with large bath towels. The employees who helped us the most were Mark and Amelia, at the front desk, Kim, in reservations, and Kevin, in maintenance. Thanks to them it wasn't a total disaster.

245,Short trip before flight,Very good over all.  Service in the bar very slow.  Hotel room was excellent.  Bed and shower first class. Availability of holiday parking rates was a great plus.  Shuttle bus really efficient and good service. ,4,2021,11,01
245,2 overnight stays,"Stayed 2 separate nights as we were
going to the UK for a family funeral
Very convenient for the airport. Shuttle
Service too and fro regularly.  We had to wait
a half hour for the shuttle bus coming back from the
UK late at night. Perhaps they were short staffed",4,2021,10,31
245,"The Decline and Fall of the Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport","I've previously used this airport when flying very early or arriving very late but haven't used it in nearly 2 years due to the recent travel restrictions. 

I have to say that I was shocked at how the hotel has significantly declined in pretty much every aspect. The staff at the front desk didn't seem to know what they were doing, our pre-booked interconnecting rooms became 2 separate rooms with intervening rooms between and the pull-down beds not even made up as. 

The rooms were absolutely disgusting, food debris from the previous occupants quite visible, grubby carpets, a bathroom with broken shower facilities, and that smelt of excrement. The towels were thrown on the towel rack with hairs attached. My children refused to even use the facilities to brush their teeth. 

Duvet covers very worn and torn, 

The photos shown on this site in no way resemble the current state of the the rooms on offer.

Couldn't wait to get out of there in the morning, didn't want to risk trying the food and had breakfast in the airport McDonalds instead.",1,2021,10,31
245,Exceptional staff,"I had booked the hotel through booking.com but somewhere along the way my reservation only showed as 2 person family room instead of 5 of us. The staff on duty 2 ladies ( didn't get their names unfortunately) could not have been more efficient and considerate. This was at 00.15 at night but they could not have been more professional and found us a solution within 15 mins. We were all tucked up in bed after getting off our 23.30 flight by 00.45.
Rooms were perfect and the beds were super soft but it really was the fantastic customer service by these 2 ladies that showed the Radison Hotel to be a hotel worth recommending to others.They as well as the safe parking outside the hotel doors would  definitely mean that on future journeys I would definitely stay here.",5,2021,10,30
245,Very Dissatisfied,"I’ve stayed here so many times solely because of the location and proximity to the airport for early morning flights. However the standards and customer service here have decreased dramatically. The check in is mostly soulless and cold, no recognition of continued loyalty. Despite regular paying in excess of €120 a night. The requests in your booking are ignored and the rooms are dating badly. I recently stayed in one of the “updated” premium rooms on the 4th floor. Yes the decor is nice and warm but there was actual dried in blood on the floor and walls of the bathroom and long hairs on the locker beside the bed. In these times of concern for health & the need for increased cleanliness  I found this deplorable. I sent numerous emails of complaint before I eventually got a response. I know the hospitality industry is struggling to keep staff but standards need to be met and faults pointed out so they can be rectified.",1,2021,10,27
245,expensive for what you get,"its convenient to the airport and the staff are nice. The bus has seen better days, the TV channels never works properly and some of the rooms are vey dated and poor. 
But I still go back........best of a bad lot perhaps.",3,2021,10,27
245,Horrible Experience Start to Finish,"I have no words to explain how terrible my stay here was. I normally stay at a different hotel when I need to stay overnight in Dublin before flying home to USA but my coworker recommended your hotel and I gave it a try this time. 

The bed was two twin beds pushed together - impossible to sleep with a crack in between the beds that separated if you even came close to it. The mattresses both had massive divets in the bottom and you immediately sunk into the bed (not in a good way). There were no outlets in the room that were accessible from the bed or the couch - they were all on the opposite side of the room so that you had to stand up to use your phone or laptop if it needed to be plugged in. The television got 3 channels. I couldn't even get onto Wifi for long enough without it dropping to scroll social media or complete the work I needed to that evening on my laptop. I had to push the couch to the wall so that i was able to charge my phone and use it while charging so i didn't have to stand the whole time. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. The plastic flap that I am assuming was meant to act as a shower curtain or shower door did absolutely nothing to keep the water inside of the shower and when I got out of the shower the entire bathroom floor was flooded from the shower. The shower itself was grimy and dirty - and there was not enough room in the bathroom to actually even maneuver. I could hear every single word of conversation from the hallway all night - people with children were actually running and and down throughout the hallway, yelling, almost all evening. 

The fact that I was charged good money to stay for one night in this hotel was honestly appalling, but by the time I arrived at 7:15pm on a Friday I had no choice but to stay. ",1,2021,10,26
245,Location is perfect.,Location is perfect. But the rooms aren't the bathroom has an inbath shower which is hard to get on. The receptionist is very slowly with handle everything such as payment and delivering of the room card. And give you a lot of non-use full information which causes a long queue.,3,2021,10,24
245,Great location but awful hotel,"We booked this to stay overnight following a late flight. We paid in advance for overnight car parking.
There was no bottled water in the room. The toilet cistern was held on to the bathroom wall with mastic. The dislocated toilet seat obstructed access to the flusher.
The fixtures were rusty. There was evidence of poorly executed repairs. The bed was fine. In the morning we tried to exit the carpark. The ticket was our of date. I went back to the hotel reception to have the problem solved. There was nobody there. I waited 10 mins and went back to the carpark where my car was causing frustration to other drivers trying to exit. Eventually an attendant appeared.  He was most unhelpful.  He eventually got a new ticket to enable us exit.
25 minutes wasted and a lot of frustration...never again!",1,2021,10,19
245,I night stop over,"Hotel was nice, close to airport. Beautiful room and staff all friendly and helpful. 
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM: 
1.Would have been nice to have a small shop or stall to buy snacks, bits n pieces etc....and I believe there were no vending machines. 
2. Bathroom, in particular shower screen and around taps and tiles could have been cleaner and maybe in need of maintenance. 
",5,2021,10,19
245,Great Hotel.  Great Location,Conveniently located near airport.  Services were as expected.  Clean and modern.  Checking and checkout were easy.  Restaurant food was good.  Paid parking was the only thing that was not as expected due to it not being entirely comped by hotel.,5,2021,10,18
245,Stay before flying,"The hotel is very well located across from Dublin Airport.
The rooms are comfortable but could use better lighting.
The staff was excellent. The Collage menu could include
fish not fried in batter and vegetarian options.",4,2021,10,18
245,Food not great for  a radisson,"Room was lovely but the main restaurant food very poor 
Slow service 
Seafood chowder was nothing special and the steak was just ok 
Not sure would go back tbh 
Might try another hotel nearby next trip 
Although I do like my points",1,2021,10,18
245,BLU Hotel,Excellent service breakfast was unreal loads of options to try out great healthy eating option aswell. The room was nice size great size T. V very comfort bed like the view from the room I was in perfect. ,5,2021,10,17
245,Disappointed,"Disappointed with hotel experience. I’ve stayed in other radisonn blue before and they were better. Experience with breakfast was bad. Woman at entrance questioned our right to breakfast as we weren’t in the system. Only when I insisted we had pre-paid and pre-booked did she question the system and check at main reception desk. I was embarrassed. 
I wouldn’t come back",2,2021,10,12
245,"Comfortable room, good dining","Great place to relax and dine. Room was spacious and had a choice of a bath and shower. We had a lovely dining experience.  T3 bar ambience could have been better, probably not helped by the COVID cloud overhanging us still. ",4,2021,10,08
245,"Broken Shower, outdated room","The shower was not working , which is unacceptable. No charging ports available near the bed either to charge phone. I enjoyed my last stay here, but my mind has totally changed now since this time, poor value for money..",2,2021,10,08
245,Great hotel for a late night arrival to DUB,Passing through late night and connecting to next flight mid morning. It was so easy to walk there from the terminal and back. Not having to rely on the shuttle. The breakfast was outstanding. All the team members were friendly and helpful. ,5,2021,10,04
245,expect more from Radisson,"Stayed two separate nights on either side of a trip to England. Staff friendly and accommodating
Both rooms were tired, old, shower in the bathtub, beat up furniture, only 1 chair between the desk and the table. Hotel in serious need of updating.
Pleasant bar, excellent shuttle to the airport, fairly easy walk- downhill- from airport with luggage, handy after car rental.",3,2021,10,01
245,Illa in the main dining room,We were very pleasantly surprised by the outstanding service of Illa in the main dining room. Even though she was extremely busy she volunteered to help us get cocktails from the bar at the other side of the hotel.  Raddison is extremely fortunate to have her on their team.  Thank you.,5,2021,09,30
245,5star in every regard,"Great choice.Very happy with the physical product and service by staff was top class.The hotel is modern but has generated a heart and soul.
The management have generated a fantastic team ethic with customer service at its centre",5,2021,09,28
245,Super Nice Hotel and Staff,"We stayed one night in preparing to fly home the next morning.  We were provided an early check in which was very welcome and appreciated.  Everyone we had contact with was helpful and friendly.  We needed an extension cord for use with my cousin’s CPAP machine and it took a couple of tries to find one that worked but the staff very patiently helped with it.  We had lunch in Collage and dinner in the other restaurant… both were great!  We had the best pizza of our trip for dinner and a wonderful cheese cake dessert.  All in all, what a wonderful ending to our month in Ireland!  Couldn’t ask for a thing more! ",5,2021,09,26
245,dirty hotel room,"This hotel is close to the airport, had booked a room due to an early flight, location is very good with shuttle service to the airport but standard room very old, and hadn’t been cleaned in weeks…lots of dust of the headboard proved this - wouldn’t recommend this hotel, ",2,2021,09,24
245,Great hotel with a small minus,"Stayed in this hotel twice i last 2 months. First time I've stayed in premium room - High floor
 Absolutely amazing and newly refurbished.great bathroom with rain shower. I can only say highly recommen this type of room. Second time i did booked supreme room (with barh) but in my opinion it's was more standard one. Room was lovely and refurbished and looks brilliant. Beds comfortable. Room 340 has amazing view on airports and sunset if you like. Unfortunately bathrooms in my opinion was disaster for 4 star Well known hotel. Old bad with rust aroud. Dirt on air vent. Clearly need to be done. Ruin good opinion in minutes. Don't understand why barely no cosmetic in bathroom.  Restaurnt it's amazing. Compliments to chef. Had a dinner twice and chicken and pizza were lovely. Good attentive staff. Lovely hotel with own charm. Only this little thing to upgrade - bathroom and would be amazing 👌 attaching pictures of bathrooms. Overall very good hotel if we book right premium room.",4,2021,09,19
245,quick stop,"Stayed one night waiting for a flight, the hotel is in a great location for the airport, a few minuets walk there is also a shuttle available which we used and the driver could not have been more helpful with our luggage and getting us a cart at the airport. The hotel is nice and clean and the room was excellent with all the mod cons of a great hotel ( the tv was a bit iffy but it was ok ) we did not use the restaurant but the bar was very nice with great décor with pictures of Dublin airport in days gone by. We had room service and it was very good. When we need a hotel at Dublin Airport we will be using this hotel",5,2021,09,16
245,Beneath the Radisson brand.,"Guest room door ajar upon check-in.  Holes is guest room wall.  Key provided did not work.  No room service menu in the guest room - had to call and have one sent up.  Room service for two arrived with only one set of silverware - server notified, and said she would return with 2nd set, but never reappeared.  No ice bucket in room, or ice vending available.  Asked to speak to manager on duty, but was refused.",1,2021,09,12
245,Dissatisfied ,"Great location.... but extremely poor service from staff, very limited choice in the restsurant and the hotel was freezing. Full aircon on and it was a wet and miserable day in September.  I won't be returning unless great improvements are made. ",1,2021,09,12
245,Radisson,Very friendly and helpful team at the Raddison. The food in the Collage is superb and the fact that it’s location is five minutes walk from the Airport makes it a great choice and good value for money. ,4,2021,09,11
245,Pay for breakfast,"They don't tell you that you pay extra for breakfast when you are booking. Shower of robbers. If I had known that I would not get breakfast in the morning, I'd never have booked a room. Very disappointing",1,2021,09,06
245,2 separate layover stays,"Really like the comfort of the bed and quality of the sheets. It has become my preferred Dublin Airport hotel after too many issues at the Maldron Hotel next door. Stayed on a layover after arriving from the states and everything was flawless and got a great 7 hour sleep before my next flight. Stayed on my return and all was well except I was checked into a room with a coffee table but no seating area, it took time to resolve but I was moved in the end. Picture attached. Will stay again the issue was minor and I give 5 stars",5,2021,09,05
245,Great Hotel,The hotel was as expected. Service was excellent from the front desk up until the restaurant. The room was clean and spacious.  The only flaw was the bathroom it was clean and spacious but the bath was not.clean it had shaving residue and hairs around the rim. ,4,2021,09,05
245,"3* Hotel, not 4*","Window would not close properly during the night which left the room cold. Furnishings were definitely not 4 star worthy and the TV was hanging on the wall and unable to tilt towards the bed. It was also tiny, with a bad range of channels. The double bed was made up of 2 single mattresses and the water pressure was abysmal. There was also no Barry's or Lyon's tea available to make tea!",3,2021,09,03
245,Excellent hotel,"After pur camperholiday we had the Radisson Hotel booked for our last day in Dublin. We had to deliver  our rented van at 9.00 am. So we arrived very early, at 10.00 am, in the hotel. Check in time was three pm. When we explained our situation to the lady behind the desk she booked us a room that we could use immediately. Super. Spacious room, very well furnished, modern, beautiful bathroom and a very good bed.",5,2021,08,27
245,Good location!,"The hotel is about 2 km from the Terminal 2.  We waited for the courtesy bus for 35 minutes, but the sign said that the bus would come every 15 minutes.  My reservation was cancelled without any notices (I made the reservation online.).  However, the staff was helpful to honor it.  The restaurant looked nice and clean, but my food order was not accurate.  ",3,2021,08,19
245,"Nice room and good position, but....","The only very good thing of the Hotel is the position, very close to the airport. The price of the room too high for the service and for the quality offered. 
The rooms are big and you can sleep in quiet because you can't hear any noise. 
The expensive breakfast is absolutely not enough. No fresh food (only fruits) and if you don't like Irish breakfast, you will not eat. Coffee awful, milk in the coffee machine not available. 
The worst thing is the restaurant (not even cheap). Very nice the two waitresses. The menu pretty good,  but the lady, manager on duty, responsible of the payments and of the tables, very impolite and rude (I'm not Irish, but I live in Ireland and I know very well how welcoming the Irish are!!! She's not. ) 
I don't think I will come back because: 
-the quality is not enough compared to the price 
- working in 4 stars hotel means having all the tipical standards of luxury places (correct approach, attitude, welcoming, smiling, polite ways) because the guest is paying a lot for the service. ",2,2021,08,17
245,Quick airport transit stopover,"Perfect location to rest before an early morning flight.

Everyone is adjusting to the changing Covid rules and hoping for greater normality.  The staff were very efficient and the hotel was clean.  The transit from the hotel is a great service for those early morning flights and very efficient.",5,2021,08,17
245,Lovely hotel in walking distance to the airport,"I booked this hotel as my flight was arriving at 4am and I didn’t want to risk driving tired. Everyone I met, even at 5am was welcoming. I had a great sleep, with a late checkout and a fantastic shower. Will definitely stay here again 😊",5,2021,08,17
245,Stop over for early morning flight,"Stayed here ahead of an early morning Ryanair flight back to East Midlands. 

Had previously just dropped hire car off with Hertz in their external compound and if you get the shuttle bus back to airport and get dropped off at Terminal 2 it’s just a 5 minute walk to hotel. 

Room was comfortable and check in efficient, Wi-fi quick enough to stream on iPad and food in restaurant pretty good (had the fish and chips plus apple crumble for desert). 

Next morning was a 10 minute walk to Terminal 1 check in for Ryanair flights.",4,2021,08,16
245,What is the problem?,"I may be unfair to this hotel because my issue is not with reception or the room but the restaurant! And that may be tendered out. Not sure. The receptionist was lovely but clearly overworked (long queues) the room was spacious and spotless but the restaurant was a disaster! Arrived 7.30 pm, waited to be seated for over 5 minutes, met by a woman who thrust a menu in my hand and told to go “over there”. Greeted by a completely bare table ( repeat completely bare!), waited and waited and waited ( more than 2O minutes) and it was by
no means busy! Eventually was able to order and at the same time ordered a glass of wine. Waited waited waited. Food eventually arrived but wine
came AFTER I had finished the meal. Food was ok but pub food. Captive audience for those who have early morning flights and need to eat! Does not reflect my experience of Irish hospitality at all!!",1,2021,08,16
245,Appalling Service with COVID breaches,"I visited this hotel just a week ago and did complain at the time and am still awaiting a response from someone. 
When I was in the hotel I had a meal in the bar only to be accosted by a group of people singing, dancing, joining tables together, trying to join my table all whilst not wearing a mask. To the best of my knowledge music singing dancing and sitting at a table with more than 6 adults are all breaches of Covid regulations in place on the date visited. I reported this to reception and nothing was done to deal with these numerous breaches at least whilst I was still in the bar having my meal. I found the entire experience very distressing and would have liked the management to deal with the problem head on rather than waiting for someone to point it out and certainly the music provided by the revellers own smart phone would have been a start and could have prevented the matter becoming a total breach of government regulations. 

I would not recommend a stay at this hotel whilst Covid guidelines and regulations are still in place",1,2021,08,13
245,Excellent,"
Excellent - hotel's employees were courteous and caring and made me feel welcome and valued as a customer. All my requests were satisfied. The food was tasty. All facilities were cleaned and the location is easily accessible!",5,2021,08,08
245,Fantastic hotel with great service,"Fantastic service from reception although there was quite a wait at times, especially when collecting our food. Worth the wait though, as very tasty despite being a little on the cold side. Wonderful, comfortable room which was the perfect location for Dublin Airport. Thank you very much. ",5,2021,08,08
245,Perfect hotel,"Ideal location, beautiful rooms, great restaurant and staff. For one night this was perfect and got our holiday off to a great start. We got a courtesy bus to the airport and were at check in in 5 minutes, hard to beat.",4,2021,08,07
245,Such a lovely hotel and staff,"I had the unfortunate scenario of missing my flight with my 18mth old and niece - this was beyond traumatic after travelling from cork that morning at 2am. Having no other flight options that day, I rang the raddison and Natasha greeted me and put my mind at ease immediately! We were able to check in that morning and sleep our stresses away. We found the hotel so comfortable and clean and all the staff were beyond caring and welcoming. I never write reviews but really wanted to this time as I found the team to be so so lovely.",5,2021,08,07
245,Awesome Airport Hotel,Great hotel before or after your early/late flight. We got it for 1 night and enjoyed it. Within a 8 minute walk from the terminal. Breakfast was served and very good. Service was very welcoming and our room was very spacious and comfortable. ,5,2021,08,05
245,Excellent,"Staff very helpfull and friendly, Great location. Room very clean and bed very comfortable. Bathroom was also very clean and shower was very big. I would definitely stay there again and would have know hesitation in recommending to my friends.",5,2021,08,04
245,Old fashion,Very disappointing. Brought my mum for one night before her flight. Room was very old fashion. The furniture were old and worn out. Didn't expect  this after what I saw on the website. I wouldnt stay there again. Staff very friendly and professional. I,2,2021,08,03
245,Service great,"Check in was good and helpful 
Room was good and nice
Bottles of water every day
Internet worked slow
Food in restaurant was good service was great but noise level from 2 parties was loud and waiters did not manage to make then stop
Service in bar area good
Bus to airport every 15 minutes",3,2021,07,24
245,Disappointing,"Myself and my partner have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed our stay. However, this time was really disappointing and unfortunately we will not be returning.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a lovely girl at reception who upgraded us from a standard room to one of the premium ones which she had explained were recently refurbished. Upon entering the room, we were happy enough, plenty of room and it was lovely, despite not having the option of a bath.

We then decided to order some lunch from the room menu. We called reception with our orders only to be told there would be an €8 delivery charge to our room or we would need to go down to collect it. €8.. just for a member of staff to take a tray of with two panini’s up to us. I went down to collect the food myself and told the receptionist I may struggle with scanning my room card at the lift, given I was carrying the tray. She abruptly came out from behind the desk and scanned her own card for me without saying anything. The panini’s were ok. The cheese was not melted on either and they were served with soft crisps - not great. The coffees were just far too strong.

We only realised in the early hours of the morning how loud our room was. We could hear staff in other rooms cleaning and were throwing things around and talking loudly. Luckily I had earplugs. My partner wasn’t as lucky and was awake from 6am due to this. There had also been someone staying in the hotel with their television extremely high so it was a late night for us as it was.

The next morning, we decided to order breakfast. Again the €8 charge applied for delivery but we decided to pay it as it would have been too much for either of us to carry and I didn’t want to experience the abruptness of staff if I was unable to scan my card with the tray in my hands going into the lift. When the breakfast arrived, it came with no sauces/salt or pepper, sugars or napkins. We had to call down twice to ask for these and the sugars (approx 50 of them) were handed to us in a huge plastic bag which we found extremely rude. By the time they all had arrived, the breakfast had gone cold. The staff member who delivered it also demanded payment immediately rather than adding it onto our room.

The final straw for me was when checking out, I asked for an exit ticket for the car park for which I was charged €7.50. I was only told when leaving the hotel after asking, that it was not free for guests. Absolutely disgraceful. These are things that should have been explained upon arrival and checking in. Never again. I need an early night to catch up on the lost sleep!",2,2021,07,16
245,Lovely stay,"Stayed at the hotel the night before my flight. Got upgraded to a premium room. Queen bed, desk area, small bathroom. The mini fridge worked but was more cool than cold. The bedding was a big down duvet, which got a little hot. The AC worked fine and my windows opened a little. The shuttle to the airport was brilliant and the restaurant had good options for dinner and breakdast.",4,2021,07,16
245,Excellent hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, It was fabolously clean and very luxiourious team were friendly and we really enjoyed our stay. The location to the airport was excellent.

245,Good Hotel for an overnight in Dublin Airport,"I was staying there for business purposes and the service at the bar was very good. The room was not the best maintained one. But in previous times, I got the chance to stay in better room at the same hotel. ",3,2021,07,10
245,Good experience,"Came here passing through on my way to the airport. Needed to stay a few days while getting the PCR test for Covid. Room and breakfast were very good quality, but the blankets were a bit too warm for me.",5,2021,05,29
245,Good stay as usual,Had an early flight and overnighted at the Radisson in Dublin airport the night before. I Was very pleased with the service and room. We ate in the restaurant and enjoyed it. Will stay again and again.,5,2021,05,02

245,Anonymous,"1 night stay for an early flight
This hotel is right at the airport, it is a short walk to Terminal 2. It blew me away with the standards for airport hotels, with good sized rooms and a nice lobby area, where you can check in and a very nice coffee dock with very happy staff.

 The restaurant is nice with a good menu with a lot of national dishes to choose from.Where I had dinner when I checked in. The waitress, Megan was very friendly and helpful and had well knowledge of the food menu and also the wine menu.
She really made my stay with how professional she was at her work and also the atmosphere she made.Thank you Megan I hope to meet you here again as I really recommend this place!!",5,2021,04,18
245,Making the most of a di,"Just wanted to say that our stay at the Radisson Blu recently was very good. All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and helpful right from check in, dining and the shuttle the next morning to the airport. The food was excellent and reasonably priced as well. We would definitely stay there again.  ",4,2021,04,10
245,Excellent from check in to check out,"From the Moment I checked I was greeted with smiles by  Gabrielle from reception  who made sure i was very well taken care of, The restaurant is exceptional i ate there on both nights of my stay Megan made sure we got everything we needed it is with the cheerful staff that makes the hotel a great space and ambience especially during these turbulent times",5,2021,04,05
245,Great Experience,"Pros: Fantastic staff. Clean, spacious, comfortable room (Standard Room). Soundproof from outside the building - can't hear the planes. Restaurant accessible and awesome food.
Cons: Heater instantly turns off after a few hours. Free WiFi is unstable.",5,2021,03,12
245,Comfy beds,Overall a great experience. Room service fee a bit steep at €8 otherwise everything was perfect. Have stayed a few times and will definitely go back. Very handy for my early morning flight. Much better than its neighbouring hotel! ,5,2021,03,10
245,Great stay!,"After I missed my flight, I found this hotel to stay for one night and I was delighted with the customer service,location, food service, It was a great experience in general , I recommend it, good luck.",5,2021,03,06
245,Covid and emergency traveling,Upon arrival you were greeted with friendly staff. Secure and welcoming facility. I had a great view of the airport and watched the few that were traveling take off and land. My favorite part of the room was the shower and good night sleep I had. The shuttle driver that took me to the airport was friendly and helpful. ,4,2021,02,24
245,Unbelievably Amazing Customer Service,"Had a long layover so my wife and I stayed here until our connecting flight was leaving. Unfortunately, my baggage was delayed by the airline and when it ultimately arrived it was in literal pieces. Smashed to bits. The front desk staff was incredibly helpful in trying to help with our dilemma (offering us tips on where we could possibly purchase one and even offering to help us send our items by post to our final destination). Ultimately, one amazing staffer offered their own suitcase, even went out of their way to retrieve it after their shift was over and bring it back to us. Truly helped us in a bind so I had to share our experience. The hotel was very clean, had comfortable nights sleep, and the food was good too. The only hard part was trying to get a variety in food for my vegetarian wife.",5,2021,02,21
245,Nice hotel,"Great stuff,good service,polite and helpful people, bec of them will come back. Room was not perfect with bath, reception offeted better but I was lazy to change room. Also was lazy to find my loyality number/card.COVID measures are great. Hotel is super-clean. Also due to early flight my carrie-on breajfast was great. Have agree ham&cheese sandwiches, but kitchen even prelared better - roasted chicken breasts. That was great of them, but I am allergic to poultry and eggs.🤣 Also bunch of muffins was inside, but same I can not eat..
So, my foult again, I did not declared to reception which problems I have. Bec I am lazy....so my lazyness costed me a lot this time, but again-do not blaime hotel . 😁",4,2021,02,20
245,Excellent stay ... highly recommend,"I stayed at this Radisson Blu in January 2021. COVID protocols were excellent and very professionally implemented by everybody working in the hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. They did a great job to make the stay enjoyable, despite the COVID restrictions. Great choice of food in the restaurant. Would highly recommend for either personal or business travelers.",5,2021,02,08

 good hotel with a very nice staff, everything went smoothly i slept well and the food was good. i loved the bread with mozzarella in particular and the tiramisu was amazing. the people were super nice and helpful",4,2021,01,22
245,EL MUBARAK,"This us in line with my short stay at this Hotel which I got a very positive impression from the time I check in. Staff are so helpful understanding with a very important thing a good smile. A good welcoming relive yourself from any stress or travel exhaustion. Also the location is very ideal because its closed by to the Airport. 

Therefore, I will recommend this Hotel to anyone who are looking for an  EXCELLENT SERVICES.

245,"Radisson Blu a great stopover at Dublin airport,  where the staff care About their guests!!","After an uncomfortable and tiring journey by air to Dublin and landing in  not pleasant conditions, driving rain and winds, the Hotel proved to be the “bolt hole” I  very much needed.
From contacting  reception via their courtesy phone at terminal 1, and being assured that a courtesy  bus would pick me up in 5 minutes I began to relax for the first time in almost 6 hours. Receptionists and drivers all so very kind and thoughtful. The  quality  and comfort of the bedroom  was excellent too.w",5,2021,01,18
245,Short & Sweet Stay.,"Staying overnight before long international flight, 1 adult with 3 young kids under 10.  Comfort, convenience, cleanliness and support of the FrontDesk staff were all necessary.  The hotel did not disappoint. The Front-Desk Evening/NIght shift staff were excellent - very helpful (printing all travel documents needed for a complex immigration process). The restaurant staff were very friendly and supportive.  Only area for improvement would be to see how the shuttlebus could be better used to help guests returning from car-rental returns. ",5,2021,01,17
245,Amazing!,"It was an amazing stay. Staff was incredibly helpful and kind, they made sure we were feeling comfy and great. The shuttle service from the airport is great too and incredibly handy, they get everything sorted for you. Would repeat and recommend!",5,2021,01,09
245,"Good for a quick overnight stay, beware distance from terminal building","Overall, I would generally be happy enough with this hotel for the preflight stay but I would caution travelers with luggage this hotel is in the airport complex but not attached to the terminals. It’s a bit of a walk, and curbside slip prevention at the crossings makes trudging luggage there a bit of an issue. Excellent COVID precautions. ",4,2021,01,01
245,Over expectations,"Normally this airport Hotels are pretty basic, this is a very nice hotel with professional staff and 5 stars service. I will come back. This was my first time flying through Dublin to the USA but Radisson Blu has made such a point in it that I will use this airport in the future again",5,2020,12,17
245,Caring and friendly.,I was supposed to be on a 24hr trip to Dublin stopping 1 night at the Radisson which turned into 3 nights following an incident. The staff were very caring and offered me support during the time there. I though the service was genuinely caring and friendly. I would stay there again.,5,2020,12,14
245,Top marks!!,"Most enjoyable stay. Would recommend for sure. Excellent, friendly and most helpful staff. Was granted a late checkout which suited our flight time. Evening restaurant and breakfast staff were lovely and friendly. Night Porter was a thorough gentleman. It was pouring rain as we departed and the receptionist organised the shuttle service immediately. We were very happy customers and we highly recommend The Raddison Blu Dublin Airport. ",5,2020,11,16
245,stay,"Very good, apart from bathroom needed refurb, toilet seat kept falling down, room was lovely and bed was lovely excellent service, porter got fresh milk for me late at night as just came off a flight and needed a cup of tea.",5,2020,11,16
245,Work trip,"Nice hotel and good location for my requirements. 
The room is a nice size and I was particularly impressed with the shower. The bed was too soft for my preference but I still slept. The hot breakfast could have been hotter",4,2020,11,14
245,Short stay near the airport,"We stayed at the Radisson Blu while relocating from Dublin. Our stay was 2 nights and we took a family room.

Checking in was easy and the staff were courteous and helpful throughout. Infact the staff were really very helpful and tried their best to make us feel comfortable and safe throughout our stay. 

The room was spacious and well organised. We tried both in room and restaurant dining during our stay to get a feel for both options. Both are very good and you get a good variety to choose from whether ordering room service or eating in the restaurant. 

The one let down was the cleanliness of the bathroom where we felt a lot more could have been done. There was rusting on the lower parts of the fixtures near the sink and the roof showed signs of not having been cleaned for some time.

The location is great as its within walking distance of the airport and they have a very convenient shuttle that generally runs every 15-20 minutes.

Overall a good location to stay if you need to be close to the airport.
",4,2020,11,14
245,Short stop over,"I was staying here after flying into Dublin late. 

The positives were that the staff were friendly and covid 19 precautions were very well managed. The breakfast was tasty with lots of choice and the restaurant area has been well decorated.

The room was mostly positive with the bed being large and very comfortable. The main room area has been tastefully renovated with usb charging points and a large TV on the wall. However... For some odd reason the modernisation of the room didn't extend to the bathroom. The bathroom was dated with a very weak shower. The pressure was so bad it was a struggle to wash my hair properly. This is something the hotel should address.",3,2020,11,04
245,"Radisson Blu, short stay","A very clean and comfortable hotel within 10 min walk of Dublin airport.  
Covid19 precautions were adhered to and staff very friendly.
A good selection on the menu and also some good choices at breakfast.",5,2020,10,26
245,Good location,"Very good location and walkable distance from airport.
Announces that has shuttle service for free, but is currently not working.
Bathroom outdated and with rust in the sides of the tub. Otherwise bed is comfortable and room was well cleaned.",4,2020,10,25
245,Magnificent Michaela,"Spent an evening in dublin  in Radisson Airport  Hotel. Michaela was our hostess. What a fabulous delightful experience we had. Food was great ,but service  was so attentive,warm and welcoming. The personal touch from Michaela was exemplary...Shes a winner,the midas touch.",5,2020,10,23
245,Good Quality & Efficient Service,"No fuss, quality accommodation near the airport. Efficient and fast service at the desk with good, albeit pricey, food & drink options. Shuttle to the airport was handy, but you can make the journey on foot in just 10 mins if you're travelling light.",4,2020,10,23
245,Excellent location for the airport,Travels during the pandemic are interesting and you need to prepare and choose wisely when looking at hotels and travel providers.  I have stayed at this hotel many times before so felt comfortable booking with them again.  I was not going to be going out so chose a junior suite which afforded more room space and a view of Dublin airport.  Check in was fast and my luggage was taken up to the room shortly after my arrival. Lobby was well marked with reminders of social distancing etc and lift buttons are coated  The main part of the suite was spacious and freshly done.  At present the mini bars are not in use which is understandable.   Beds and linens are luxurious and comfortable and the really nice thing about the rooms is that there are windows that you can open for fresh air which is a feature very few hotels offer.   Decent room service selections on offer and the restaurant is open. I was able to arrange a taxi at the front desk to take me back to the airport the following morning and have my luggage brought down as well.  When I stay there and travel light the walk over to the airport terminal is 10. minutes and brisk air before a flight is a nice way to start the day.  Hotel was quiet and not a lot of guests seen which is the state of travel these days.  To be fair I had some issues with the bathroom but in true Radisson fashion my concerns were addressed in a police and professional fashion and their response exceeded my expectations -I shall return to Radisson Blu in the future.,4,2020,10,13
245,Trip Home,"Super location within walking distance to Airport or they provide a shuttle but if you are traveling light its less then 10 min walk to Hotel from Terminal 2 via footpaths.
I found the rooms impeccably clean which is always my first standard. I found all furnishings to be of modern high quality. The linens and bath towels all good quality and loved the number of pillow options to choose from. I eat at the restaurant and enjoyed my meal with a draft pint. Staff were great. Although my room was unexpectedly near the elevator - the overall sound proofing of the room is solid and had a great nights sleep. 
Its well worth the stay and the amount of stress it takes away worrying about rushing through morning traffic to catch your flight - this place takes it all away and you can use that extra time to do some great duty free shopping especially now as they are offering many deals. 
The only thing I would have liked is - if the nice coffee bar was open maybe to 8pm and not close early at 5pm - but I know maybe because of low traffic and this really annoying Covid season probably have no other choice. I was also thinking of staying here after a long-haul exhaustive flight. The car rental agencies are all across the footpath - so again super convenient. Rest -getup have Irish breakfast and head over to the car rental to begin your Ireland discovery tour rested and refreshed.",5,2020,09,23
245,Highly recommended,"Conveniently located by the Dublin airport, Radisson Blue is a safe choice if you’re looking for a clean room with a comfortable bathroom as well as a smooth check-in. and check out. Highly recommended.",5,2020,09,13
245,Good for an overnight stop-off,"Very large room accommodating all 5 of us, with plenty of space. Reasonably priced and well located for what we wanted. 
Would recommend, and would stay again. 
Very clean, and plenty of covid precautions in place. ",4,2020,09,01
245,Midnight Stay till Lunch-Time,"Booked here as bus back home was not until next day. 
Very friendly staff who went out of their way to help and a credit to the company :-)

Sanitisers as you walk in and antibacterial gel pads on lift keys great idea.

Room was great with a fantastic shower, toiletries, bed super comfy and couple of complementary bottles of water.

Breakfast in morning was also great, plenty of social distancing between tables and everything made you fell safe.

Used the free mini bus back to airport in morning to catch bus and again driver wearing mask etc, 
In all very safe & well thought-out safety measures to put any traveler's mind at ease during this time.

I will be using this hotel again soon when travelling next month & recommend to any one.",5,2020,08,29
245,Technical problems and covid,"Hotel room was bad because window locking was broken. It been proken long time. Storm open it 3 times during night, it was too late to change room, between 3-5am. 
Now during covid virus I dont want use earlier customer used small shampoo botles, wrong time to save",3,2020,08,22
245,Connor devereaux,"Stayed for 2 night.During training for new job.All expenses were paided for. Staff were friendly and polite. Breakfast and dinner were of a good variety.

During my stay the staff were polite, the single room was spacious and provided with more than enough room to relax and order my meals to my room to enjoy the scenery.",4,2020,08,07
245,Bad information of direction to the hotel,"Nice priced and clean hotel very close to the airport, the only problem was that there was no shuttle available. Traveling with 3 heavy suitcases is a problem then. As far as I know there was no direction sign to the hotel at the exit of the airport.",5,2020,08,01
245,Let down ,"Stayed here for one night with my wife on a short trip to Dublin 
Booked through Booking.Com at a price and when we got to the hotel tried to charge a different amount (more) and told us it was the exchange rate , had to contact Booking.com to send email to get this changed (very helpful)
When we got to our room (superior room)
No toilet roll in the room
Phoned down to reception to get some sent up . 
Was told how unusual as room had been cleaned and ready for next guests
Tried later to get a drink and was told you had to order food due to COVID 19 and the main  bar was not open till 10 or get room service at a cost of €8 which I think is extortionate 
And as for room being cleaned I’ve added a pic of the dust beside the bed 
 ",1,2020,07,24
245,Brilliant hotel. Would stay again.,"Brilliant hotel.. 
Would happily go back again.
The facilities are brilliant. I liked the continental style breakfast.
Really well kept with hygiene for the covid 19 pendemic.
Our kids loved it that much they said can we live here and make it our home. Lol

245,Excellent hotel and extremely friendly and helpful staff,"The room is spacious, very comfortable and clean (specially important due to the current COVID-19 situation). The staff was very friendly and helpful. We just stayed one night due to a transfer flight. It's 10 min walk from the airport (the shuttle bus was suspended)",5,2020,07,19
245,Wonderful.,"The welcome at reception was warm, welcoming and  I was informed of everything, due to the changes caused by the Corona virus. The attention to hygiene was excellent.
My room was spotless, with a comfortable bed and lovely shower room. Although the restaurant was closed, hot snacks were available for room service. 
An early morning taxi was arranged and it arrived exactly on time. 
It was a wonderful experience in spite of all the restrictions. I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2020,07,07
245,Perfect over night stay,"The girls on reception were lovely and welcoming, one girl was called Martina, she was very nice, I think the other lady was Katherine or Kathleen, I'm not 100% but they were lovely people. Room was spotless and clean,  bathroom shower was amazing, I couldn't fault my stay, esp when it was just out if lock down, so things were a bit up in the air, but the hotel had it covered. ",4,2020,07,05
245,Review,"Great service, staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was great and comfortable. However the breakfast area could have been laid out better. I found it hard to find stuff, especially the coffee....",5,2020,06,07
245,Thank You!,"My stay at the Radisson Blu Hotel was in very special circumstances, during the Covid lockdown, for which I am very thankful because otherwise I would have to spend the night in the airport. All staff was very helpful, polite and professional. I was upgraded to a premium room with breakfast and late checkout. A spacious room, big television, huge and very comfortable bed, pillows and duvet. All that you need to have a good night sleep.",5,2020,06,05
245,Excellent service,"I was staying only for one night to fly repatriate next day home. Excellent service specially when you realize how complex is to give a service under this circumstances. Big effort from the staff
Thank you and best of lucks",5,2020,05,23
245,Vas very disappointed with this hotel,"Stayed over the night before flight in the hotel. Room is very old, smelly furniture is worn out badly. I am very disappointed with this hotel stayed im many others in Radison family all was nice for the price you pay at least rooms can be kept in good condition. I  will not stay there again and I don't recommend it to anyone will prefer other hotels around airport .",2,2020,04,13
245,Good hotel,Good and professional staff and very helpfull. Hotel near the airport. Short walk from T2 or courtesy bus available.  Nice upgraded rooms. Food in restaurants are good. Stayed few times this winter in this hotel.,5,2020,03,21
245,On the way home from Scotland,"Miserable.  We waited under an airport sign announcing that the Radisson bus would pick up travelers every 15 minutes, no need to call (except from 1 am to 4 am).  We waited for half an hour.  The competition's bus picked up travelers 3 times, no Radisson bus.  We walked to the hotel, checked in and told the check in person what had happened.  She was rude, could not help and really did not care, except she would call the manager.  told me she would have to talk with the driver.  Just realize this, the driver has not performed his job for at least half an hour, and the manager knows nothing about it.  Extremely poor management and customer skills.
Just waiting to see whether my points will show upon my Radisson account.  Based on experience so far I have doubts that they can manage that.
Miserable is too charitable a word.",1,2020,03,19
245,Basic hotel 5 minutes walk from the airport,"Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, business purposes. 
Room is very basic, closet completely open, TV is very small.
No Iron in the room but you can ask and get one. 
Shower is small as well and although the stream is slow, you always find a pool on the floor at the end. 
no vanity kit in the shower.
No drinking water unless you ask for it.",3,2020,03,19
245,Great staff,"Had a great stay here recently as was waiting for a friend to return early flight so stayed in the radisson.. what a great choice, lovely breakfast and great service from gavan. Very friendly and a true gent. I can honestly say the room was clean and fresh, all staff were friendly. I would highly recommend for a night before an early flight or visiting the area.",5,2020,03,08
245,Probably your best Dublin Airport option,"I've tried most of the hotels around Dublin airport and this one may be the best option.  The others aren't bad but it's hard to beat the location, room amenities, and service of this hotel.  The staff were clearly well trained, attentive, and friendly which we all know isn't the norm for airport hotels.  I had a premium room and it had a GREAT shower.  The beds are very good but not in the great category but that would be about all I could niggle about.  We had good shuttle service back and forth from the terminal.  The cost was in line with the higher end competitors.",5,2020,03,02
245,Perfect for a night close to the airport,"I stayed at the Radisson Blu, Dublin Airport for one night, prior to an early flight the following morning. Despite being right beside the airport, it is well noise insulated, so no problem at all sleeping soundly. The room was very clean and modern. The wake up call service is perfect, as they do actually ensure you're awake, rather than the usual automated scheduled call you'd get at most hotels. The shuttle that takes you to the airport leaves every 15 minutes, so you're never left waiting, or wondering if you'll miss you're flight.
Obviously the location is far from most of Dublin City Centre activities, but it's perfect for the airport.",5,2020,03,01
245,Never Again!!!,"Thinking a hotel right by the airport would be some way decent oh how I was so wrong. I only stayed here for 1 night recently and it will be one I will never do again. Arrived at the hotel and entering the lobby I thought very nice this was goin to be a nice stay. The staff at reception looked like they did not want to be there not even a hello or a smile and coming from working on reception myself in a hotel they are key upon a person's first point of contact, straight away that put a dampener on the stay. Got checked in and went to the room. The room was very basic which is fine however it looks like it could have done wit a better clean. There was dust all along the cabinet above the bed, there were stains on the wall and markings, no guest directory in the room and the TV may aswell have bein on the floor as the bed was higher then the TV... How is any one supposed to watch telly in bed when you can't even see it. The room was cold and after about 10 mins trying to figure out how to use the temp control on the wall as again nothing there to tell you how to work it the thing wouldn't work so we decided to just leave it on 28 degrees and hope for the best our room would be warm when we got back. We went to the bar for food, now it wasn't busy but yet the girl behind the bar decided to ignore us and serve another person who had just walked in. We ordered our food and sat at a table. Food came out rather quick but at first the guy came up with our food proceeded to pass us, we called him to tell us it was our food but yet the guy still ignored us even tho we were the only ones sitting there. Eventually we got out food and I must say the food was really nice(about the only good thing to come from the hotel). Afterwards we went back to our room and it was still cold so we called reception and they said they would send someone up. About 2 mins later a guy came in had a look and said that all seems OK but we explained it still wasn't working. He told us he would go down and say it to reception. We waited about 20 mins and we heard nothing so we called back down to reception, they hung up on us first so we called again. They answered and we explained what was happening but apparantly the guy had said nothing to reception, they offered to move us rooms but at this point it was late and we were tired so we just left it. The bed was not the most comfortable and it was zipped so there was a dip in the middle of the bed. Woke up the next morning and we just decided to check out. Overall it was not the most enjoyable of stays and being a fellow hotelier I don't usually complain about these things but on this occasion if you pay a lot of money for a stay you expect to get an enjoyable experience. As the saying goes I will not be returning to this hotel again!!",1,2020,02,29
245,2nd floor room was dated,"Room had very Dated fixtures and fittings,  the bed was very soft, and the comforter too warm for the weather
No blanket options provided in closet
Bathroom was very badly setup with very old fittings which looked due for replacement",3,2020,02,29
245,Review,"Cheers, more fruit at breakfast the only advice to give. Staff were excellent. This review is just being stretched to 200 words now . Really friendly, proficient staff who we could only think well of.  The amount of money paid was fairly expensive but for a last minute unexpected visit was grand. ",4,2020,02,25
245,Not good,"Well what can I say, I have stayed in a lot of the radissons and the airport radissons a few time a year, not only once’s offs. First off all I asked are the TV screens any bigger in the premium rooms as our last stay the room had a tiny tv screen. We where told there all big not a problem but then the receptionist started to quiz us on how many times we stay here. You do not quiz any customer and also we called her bluff when she checked on are loyalty number mmm. The Bed and the room were clean and a good standard but the bathroom had something very odd on the flush button hence to say I wasn’t putting my hand near it as in the photo posted.  

We went down for breakfast as they have a great selection including gluten free, we picked a table a girl was cleaning, she left a load of food under the table we thought she would come back to clean it but no, then the manager walks around the coffee dock she must of see it but didn’t act. The windows in the food area are filthy, the same hand print I saw a month ago when I stayed was still there.
You are a international hotel potentially the first hotel tourists see, I would expect better.",1,2020,02,23
245,"Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at.3 floors are old rooms, outdated etc","The hotel looks amazing from the pictures, the 2 top floors were renovated and the rest look like a old motel room from the 70s, lumps out of furniture and old fixings. The price I paid was way more than the other hotels around it, we walked across to the maldron for drinks as there was no one staying in the t2 bar, the drink were terrible and no atmosphere. The minute we went to the maldron we knew we made a big mistake staying in the raddison blu! It was much better with loads of people staying there. I wanted to try and see could I get a refund and book into the maldron but didn’t bother in the end. My advice is not to stay in this hotel!!!",1,2020,02,22
245,Final destination before returning home,"Great location to end a busy trip through Ireland. I was able to relax and sleep well knowing I had an easy quick trip to the airport in the morning! The mattress was heavenly and the front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating, ",5,2020,02,16
245,Never again,Ask for things in room but didn't get had to ask twice for toilet paper  for room and water fridge broke not clean stain on sheet under pillow charged twice for breakfast paid for late check out but left at 10.30 in morning charged  for things I did not get.,3,2020,02,10
245,SUB STANDARD ROOMS ALERT,"Booker beware!!!  Two floors of this hotel have been renovated in recent years and, it would seem, irrespective of the room being standard before renovation they are now automatically Premier rooms that are considered upgrades from the standard if requested. On pest yet resent stays I had a renovated room that featured a walk-in shower, a more cheery decor and a more easily regulated heating system. As a result, had erroneously believed that all rooms had been renovated .. this was a sorry mistake. Despite my silver level Radisson Rewards card my booking of a standard room last night failed to afford me a renovated room. A full-on storm had seen that the hotel became fully booked post my room allocation so little could be done to improve my room. It is difficult to describe how bad the room was! I visited two rooms and the stench of rancid water/mould - possibly emanating from the heating system was literally suffocating. The room was freezing and the thermostat little reactive. In my view, he ""Airport Hotel"" as a concept and reality, worldwide, remains the last hold-out of putting a captive customer last. This property is a good example of just how satisfactory standard rooms for weary travellers are and that, as customers we still have choices.  I remained firm yet polite when seeking a solution at the front desk yet found my male interlocutor unnecessarily truculent and totally lacking in the compassion and service attentiveness one might feel entitled to expect. I understood the hotel was full and had accepted that I could not change yet his haughty and confusing explanation of what a standard/premier room lacked tact, warmth or understanding. Overall a very, very disappointing experience which is considerably below par for the Radisson brand.",2,2020,02,10
245,Losing touch,"This used to be my favourite hotel at or near Dublin Airport but I'm afraid it has lost that position. I've reviewed it before and things have progressively gotten worse.

For a brief overnight stay last week, we tried to book a Junior Suite on their Website but had no luck. Their Web site is very poor but I had immediate success on Booking.com so we used that.

Perhaps people who use Booking.com to book get given inferior rooms but for the first time in years, we were allocated a Junior Suite but on the 2nd floor, the one floor that has not yet been refurbished. The room was acceptable - I've stayed in this hotel many times so I know both the old and new rooms.

However, for the money spent {€202} and bearing in mind my status in their guest loyalty scheme, I expected a little better. Ok - I didn't book directly through the hotel website (and explained why to the Receptionist) so I wasn't expecting them to give me loyalty points but a little recognition of yet another stay with them would have been nice.

For example

The plumbing fittings on the shower came away in my hand.

No face flannel was provided.

Two small bottles mineral water were provided but the minibar fridge in which they were placed was not working.

No bathrobe or slippers or plastic shower caps were provided.

The room was in desperate need of updating - ok - this is, of course, planned.

When staying here over the years, we used to have dinner in the ""T3 bar"" but this outlet sadly stopped serving full meals a year or two ago when the hotel's new ""Collage"" dedicated restaurant opened. 

Collage is not bad and the food is fine (even if the service is a bit slow) but it lacks the atmosphere of the T3 Bar and it's expensive. When checking in, I specifically asked if T3 had returned to serving full meals and was told that they only did chicken wings and snacks like that. Needing a square meal, we ate in Collage at a cost of nearly €100 for two including a bottle of wine. Then, out of curiosity, we popped into T3 for a look - imagine our surprise when we saw they had three full menus - see photographs - If we had known, we would have eaten there.

Anyway - that's it - we were very disappointed that we seem to have been discriminated against for booking thru Booking.com and for everything else listed above - not good enough. I don't think we will be back - a pity to say Cheerio to an old friend.",3,2020,02,09
245,We were there close to Xmas so they had free Xmas cake and Xmas mince pies to help yourself to in the Lobby.,We had a large spacious family room which was clean and very comfortable.The restaurant and lounge were large and the food excellent.The hotel is about 300m from the airport and close to the rental car drop off. We walked from the rental drop off to the hotel and took our life in our hands crossing the road to the hotel. Going back to the airport we took the hotel shuttle. After checking out we remembered we had left keys in our room and the receptionist was very helpful letting us back into the room to collect them.,4,2020,02,04

245,Dublin airport stay,Stayed at this airport many times as company books this and is close to the airport. Room could use an upgrade and also the windows in the rooms. Staff very helpful and professional. Breakfast is good in the morning also if leaving early there is a small bfast.,3,2020,01,23
245,Exceptional service and care,"Came to Dublin with my fiance and a couple of friends. I must say it was the best hotel experience we have ever had. 

Thanks to the staff at the bar, Nina and Eli, we enjoyed every moment and they were great and it was a pure joy to both eat at the bar and drink. Service was exceptional with alot of care for foodallergies. So we felt really safe despite having celiac disease.

The reception is also outstanding. The friendlyness and care from the staff at the reception was flawless! We got help with everything we needed without any issues, and we felt appreciated.

Superb hotel if you are planning on going on some trips to the countryside of some other cities.",5,2020,01,22
245,Not quite what I was expecting - not all bedrooms have been renovated yet.,"We booked in for one night as we had an early morning flight. This was my first time staying in the Radisson hotel in Dublin airport. I usually stay in a different hotel but my daughter wanted to try this hotel. We have stayed in other Radisson hotels elsewhere & have always had a delightful stay. Here however, I advise caution. I got the shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel. The driver was a gentleman from Scotland & I must commend him highly on his manners, welcome & professionalism.  He was fantastic.  I asked him to keep an eye out for my daughter who was arriving later & he was welcoming & kind  to her also. It's this kind of service that makes the Radisson staff stand out from other hotels. I only wish we had known about the hotel's parking facilities before we booked in to the airport parking as it would have been so convenient.  Anyway, when I arrived  at the front desk Matthew was fabulous. Smiling & welcoming me (I was the first to arrive) he proceeded to check me in.  A it was mid afternoon I asked if he had any compliamentary upgrades. He was a delights & gave me a room on the 4th floor. I went up to a beautifully decorated room but as there was only one bed I returned & asked for a twin room as in my original booking. He gave me a room on the 2nd floor. The instant the lift doors opened on the 2nd floor  I was agast. The floor of the hallway was damp & stained - it looked & smelled so bad that I thought I had arrived into the carpark.  There was a foreboding atmosphere of cold & wet. The door to the allocated bedroom was bashed & looked like it had been kicked in on a precious occasion. I quickly glanced into the bedroom & left immediately once I saw that there was only one bed. To be honest I didn't like the feeling on that floor at all.  I was on my own & I did not feel comfortable. I returned once again to Matthew & he was patient & attentive & I requested a room on the 4th floor as it was a far, far nicer floor & bedroom than anything on the 2nd floor. I mentioned that there was only one bed in these rooms & his colleague butted in stating that she would arrange a fold away bed. I said 'no thank you'. I wasn't paying €142.50 to sleep in a fold away bed & that we would share a bed. Once I returned to the 4th floor I noticed little niceities like compliamentary bottles of water & a bowl of apples. A nice touch. May I suggest that a vending machine would be useful as it's lovely to have the option of a variety of snacks for the midnight munchies. When my daughter arrived we had dinner in the dining room where the service excellent & the food was well priced & delicious. The dining room was warm & welcoming on a very cold night. Our bedroom was warm, clean & nicely decorated. The linen & towels were luxurious as were the compliamentary toiletries. There was tea/coffee making facilities & room safe. It was quiet & comfortable & the shuttle bus runs every 15 mins which is so convenient especially for early mornging departures. We left the hotel early the next morning & did not avail of breakfast. If you decide to stay in the Radisson Hotel at  Dublin Airport  I suggest that you request a room on a newly  renovated floor as the other floors are jaded, tired, dirty & depressing. I will return once I hear that all rooms have been renovated. I feel I had a very luck break being gifted a compliamentary upgrade but I would not like to take advantage of same so cannot risk staying here at nornal rates until all renovations have been complete.  Thank you Matthew for saving me & for making my stay at the Radisson a very pleasant one. -:)))",4,2020,01,21
245,Radisson Dublin Airport,"The front desk staff were OUSTANDING and helpful, even for troubleshooting outside of the hotel environment/responsibility.  The room was very clean and nice.   Had trouble getting an internet connection (kept saying none available) and the shower had a very odd head which I found difficult to adjust the angle of.  But overall a very very nice hotel",5,2020,01,21
245,"Comfortable hotel, but could do with some renovation","I stayed for one night on Thursday 16th January. Positives - bar food was very tasty and reasonably priced, robes provided in the room, very very comfortable bed and snacks provided in the lobby for early morning check out.

Areas for improvement - the hotel is very dated and could be doing with some renovation. I stayed in a superior room (324) which needs redecorated and a new bathroom. Also, the shuttle bus is quite slow and there was no communication on pick up locations etc. Finally, no vending machines!

Overall, my stay was comfortable for one night but I'd expect more from a Radisson Blu hotel.",4,2020,01,18
245,Clean and quiet hotel close to Airport,"Good, clean hotel and excellent check-in staff but staff in Departure Lounge not customer orientated. Rooms are large with good facilities such as WiFi, walk-in shower, good towels.  Dinner was good, breakfast could be more refreshing.",4,2020,01,14
245,Most comfortable bed ever :),"Transferred from Maldron as they had system outage,  Had fast check-in, at Radisson, and really nice room with the most comfortable bed ever. Sorry I did not have much time there is my only regret, as I had very early flight ",5,2020,01,14
245,old and abandoned,"I will not suggest this hotel for people who are used to a good quality of services. The hotel looks like if it was done proper in the past (15 years ago) but managers are using it without any respect to the owners. Now it is ""dieing"" :(  But it is easy to get to the airport from it ;)",2,2020,01,13
245,Overnight stay for early morning flight,"Upon arrival was kindly upgraded to a premium room as I have stayed in hotel on a number of occasions. Check in was very smooth & quick and also the ability to do express check out in the morning 
Room was lovely and large, as was bathroom. Water, fruit etc provided free of charge. Room was very spacious, comfortable bed
Shuttle service to airport terminal every 15 mins and the ability to leave your car at the hotel Carpark
Perfect location and hotel especially if you need to catch an early morning flight",5,2020,01,13
245,Nice stay,Our experience was very satisfying. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We were just missing a vending maschine. But otherwise everything was perfect. It was nice that they offered coffee and tea in the reception hall for people who had to leave in the early hours. ,4,2020,01,11
245,Very close to airport.,"We had a large spacious family room, comfortable and clean. A nice touch was the free Xmas treats at reception. Staff we friendly and helpful.  Tip:Take the courtesy coach to the airport as crossing the road is hazardous. ",5,2020,01,11
245,One Night in Junior Suite,Shuttle driver was rude and unfriendly when arriving. Check in was great.  Room furnishings were very dated and the room was cold. Bathroom was tiny.  Friendly staff in bars and restaurants. Nice breakfast with a good range of hot and cold food. The room was so bad I wouldn’t stay again. ,2,2020,01,09
245,Nice hotel overall.,"A pretty nice property with clean and modern rooms, comfy beds, decent bathroom, nice and polite staff, and just overall a comfortable feeling.  We were there on a layover and the shuttle was very convenient and fast, both coming from the airport and going back the next morning.  I used points to book the room which seemed like a great deal compared to the paid rates.

And in response to some of the comments below:  I also don't like that they copied our passports, but I have found that to be standard in just about every hotel in Europe, so how it could be so surprising to anyone is curious.  And counter to the claim that the restaurant has 'excellent value', I found the exact opposite.  It is literally 16 euros for a standard burger!  It was a good looking burger, but for that price it had better be.  And most of the actual dinner choices were well closer to 30 euros.  I had a salad with duck that was pretty good, but certainly not a substantial size.  No, I wouldn't say at all that the prices provide a good value.

So overall I really liked the hotel and would definitely stay here again if passing through the airport.  But I wouldn't eat at the restaurant again.",4,2020,01,09
245,Are we taking weirdos in tonight ? ,"It’s 23.45 on NYE and that’s the welcome you get at this hotel. 
So I ask the trainee who’s helping me check in why they wouldn’t take walk ins during the holiday season ,particularly

 as this is a airport hotel ... maybe people would rather stay in a hotel than drive after a night out..?
“You get all the weirdos checking in without a booking “ she tells me. 
“Are you suggesting I’m a weirdo ?”
No answer. 
Thankfully I am granted a room and it’s a nice room and it’s quiet and comfortable. I was upgraded. 
Parking is cheap enough and it’s right next to the airport. €145. No discount for non weirdos. 
Btw ...4 staff in reception.  Not one said Happy New Year and Welcome. 
Not your usual warm Irish welcome. 
Overall better than the Maldron next door which isn’t difficult ...",3,2020,01,08
245,Invaded My Privacy,"I had no issue with showing my identification at check in, but I did not like the staff member taking it and copying it.  That was an invasion of my privacy and completely unnecessary.  I have stayed at countless hotels in Europe and the United States and this is the only time that a hotel made a copy of my ID.  ",2,2020,01,07
245,"Excellent Value in the Dining Room, everything else is under maintained and tired","Purpose:- Overnight stay close to Airport before one of our number departed on an early flight.
Booking:- via booking.com, a painless experience, as it should be for a 4* hotel with an upmarket branding.
Reception:- Adequate. The bus fare from the airport to the city is €12, not €13 as we were told. The reception “experience” felt cold, impersonal, Teflon-covered almost. The lift to the accommodation  demands insertion of the room keycard according to the plaque on the wall, but this wasn’t our experience - press the button and the lift arrives.
Room:- There was no “catalogue of services”, so fend for yourself on this one. The TV had some channels with a hard of hearing option but there was no apparent method of resetting same for normal use.  The room was “tired”, although it was clean. Furniture had seen better days. See more under maintenance and housekeeping.
Shuttle bus;- both of those we used are “tired”, panels damaged, upholstery in need of refurbishment etc
Housekeeping:- Oh dear! Beds were clean and linen/towels fresh. Why was it necessary to spray some sort of vile air spray in the room? The residual “perfume” was odious. Why not use the air freshener spray used by airlines (Horsleys?) which is barely perfumed? Shelves needed to be dusted. Vent in wardrobe area needed to be dusted. Curtains (stained) needed to be cleaned or replaced. Chair fabric had old water staining and should have been replaced. Crockery should have been clean. Toilet brush - none.  Overall, and just like the shuttle bus, the room was tired and needed a major overhaul if it is to qualify as a 4* offering.
Maintenance:- Lots needed. Plasterwork along hallway needed refurbishment and L-caps at corners. The heating radiator remained icy cold throughout our stay, The AC controls didn’t seem to control anything. A safe is a standard fitment almost everywhere these days, but none in this 4*establishment. Room size was good. Draughty window. A USB fitting is not a luxury in 21st century Ireland ....or anywhere else, but none was available here. 
Parking:- franchised out, but in the customer service hut outside the building, I would really prefer not to see envelopes with peoples’ names (Staff? Customers? - who knows?) indicating amounts owed by them and by when it is to be paid.  If the card payment system is unreliable, then it should be fixed and if a reduced parking fee is available to hotel guests, this should be fixed electronically between reception and franchisee. What was provided was archaic and more 2* than 4*.
Dining - Collage dining area:- Superb. Friendly staff. Huge portions. Reasonably priced. Piping hot, tasty food, just right. Breakfast was quite good with choice and variety. 4* demands something better than a coffee “machine”, though.  Also, check how the breakfast mushrooms are cooked - an unusual fragrance, 
If the catering standards could be transferred to the housekeeping, maintenance and transportation aspects of the business, this Radisson Blu would be a winner.
  
€129 for a double room with breakfast for 2 people. Add in €62.50 (plus tip) for dining, which brings the experience to €200. That’s simply too expensive for the  2-3* standard which was provided.",2,2020,01,07
245,Great location,Have stayed here a few times night before flights. The location is perfect. The front staff was helpful. The airport shuttle is fast and frequent. The beds were comfortable and was a quite airport despite being so close to airport.,5,2020,01,05
245,Could so easily be improved,"Too costly compared with nearby hotels (almost double what others were), no atmosphere due to small numbers, limited food/snack facilities, bedroom furniture needs to be better. Was much better in the days of being  'Great Southern'. ",2,2020,01,03
245,Early flight,Very friendly. Exceptional service in the main restaurant. They were excellent especially the matre de. Comfortable and clean room. Short walk to terminals. Less than 5 minutes to terminal 2 with a heavy suitcase. Would definitely recommend.,5,2020,01,03
245,Not what we expected,"Shabby and in need of refurbishment. Chipped mugs in room. Staff not very friendly. Overpriced breakfast option.  Bar food had minimal choice and was very poor.  
Close to airport and courtesy bus was helpful.",2,2020,01,02
245,"Convenient, but NOT comfortable","Raddison Blu is certainly convenient to travelers needing to stay at the Dublin airport. Their shuttle runs every 15 minutes and the trip to the terminals takes about 2 minutes.

However, do not expect the pinnacle of comfort. I've stayed twice and had problems with my room on both occasions. On my first stay, there was NO hot water in the shower. The walls were thin and noise from neighboring rooms disturbed my sleep.

On my second stay, the shower water temperature fluctuated from hot to cold; I couldn't control the temperature. The room was generally under-lit, and to add to the problem both the ambient and the reading lamp on one side of the bed did not work. Most problematic was the stench in the bathroom.
The bathroom was clean, mind you, and the the odor emanated from the plumbing. It smelled like sewer gas. Of course, I'm no stranger to smells in bathrooms. But maybe best when the odor doesn't assault you BEFORE you use the bathroom:-)

Staff were friendly and apologetic. They asked why I didn't ask for a room change and I explained that using my narrow window for sleep was more important than repacking and changing rooms. They offered no mitigations.",2,2020,01,02
245,Comfortable layover,"I had an overnight layover at Dublin Airport. Instead of sleeping in the airport, I decided to book a hotel room. The Radisson Blu is literally a 5-minute Walk from Terminal 2. (Take a taxi if you’ve landed at Terminal 1, as I did, since it’s confusing to navigate to Terminal 2 on the other side of the airport and then walk to the hotel.) And I did walk to Terminal 2 the next morning — though be mindful that, while there are sidewalks, there are not crosswalks. So you might have to dart across multiple lanes between traffic. That was an adventure!

Check-in was easy, with hot beverages and fresh fruit available in the lobby. The room was exceptionally comfortable. 

My flight’s departure time meant I had to check out before I could enjoy the lauded breakfast — next time. For a visit that could only include staying near the airport instead of city-center, the Radisson Blu was a perfect fit. ",5,2020,01,02
245,Horrible,"Absolutely not worth the price nor amount of stars they have. Unprofessional, unkind and unwelcoming employees. The drinks from the bar were not even cooled and draught beers were flat. The couches at the bar were covered in leftover food from the previous guests who took a seat there. The upholstered furniture in the room was absolutely full of weird stains and light switches and several lamps did not work at all. The noise from outside was insane, but the windows were single glass so that's not surprising. It seems like they didn't even try at this hotel. 
",1,2019,12,30
245,Good ,"A very good hotel. I stayed here with my family and the staff were extremely helpful. One female staff member who worked at the bar was: particularly helpful; extremely nice and very friendly. Our room had both a bath and a shower. However, the bath was quite dirty and had hairs in it. Overall, the room was clean and spacious. Food and drink was okay. ",4,2019,12,30

Very good location to travel in or out of the airport and good parking",4,2019,12,30
245,Not up to expectations,"Not up to our expectations. It was dirty in many areas, including the room. We we ate in the bar and the staff just seemed so inconvenienced by our presence. There were also no ports to charge modern technology in the room. ",2,2019,12,29
245,Fantastic Customer Service,We stayed here twice this month and it was excellent. The front desk people are fantastic! Check in was quick and efficient. Buffet was outstanding. We walked over to the hotel from the airport (10 minute walk.) On the way back to the airport we took the free shuttle. Waited about two minutes. Great driver. Helped with luggage and was very nice. Beautiful large room. Quiet and clean. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience!,5,2019,12,23
245,Collage Restaurant- Horrible Service!,"Second third time at this hotel and second time in restaurant. Every table has an assigned waiter or waitress except my table. Why is it so difficult to check on a table with one person? Why are women traveling alone overlooked and ignored? What makes people think that a male guest or customer is more important. While a manager comped me for a glass of wine, my next waitress was a very frustrated rude young woman who was mad because she had to bring me my check and she is not my waitress. So who is my mystery waitress? What ever happened to the team concept? Rooms are okay, a little beat but not too expensive. Courtesy bus to airport. Hotel is 3 stars, restaurant is one... Food is good.
",2,2019,12,22
245,Dated hotel,"The location is perfect for an early flight from Dublin airport as you can literally see the terminals from the hotel. However we found the room was in much need of renovation, with the furniture and fittings showing a lot of signs of wear and being dated. The grab and go complementary fruit and cereal bars for breakfast were very much appreciated but we're very disappointed with the shuttle bus which we're told would leave every 15minutes. We arrived promptly for the 6am shuttle bus but it was 13 minutes late leaving. We would have been faster walking to the airport. ",2,2019,12,21
245,Radisson Dublin Airport,"This hotel was great for our one night stop at Dublin Airport. You can walk from the terminal in around 10 minutes although there is a shuttle bus available.

Check in was painless, we had booked two superior rooms on the third floor. The room was large and had a fridge, iron, kettle, machine and trouser press. Everything was clean. My only criticism is that there were no plug sockets next to the bed for charging my phone overnight but that's a minor point.

We did not eat at the hotel restaurant but went to the nearby ""Kealy's"" which I've been to before. This was a 5 minute walk away.

Breakfast was nice, there was a buffet but I ordered an omelette which didn't take too long.

I will return here next time I'm at Dublin Airport.",5,2019,12,20
245,Best Hotel,"Exceptional Hotel for a stay. You will not get better care anywhere else. We have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and can not recommend any hotel as highly as The Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport.",5,2019,12,18

245,Stayed 1 night at Radisson Blu Hotel,"Due to a very early flight on 8th Dec the convenience of staying in the Radisson was great. Checking in staff were extremely friendly and helpful.

245,"Really average, just convenient ","We missed our flight and decided to come in to the hotel to spend the night before we took the 6:30 am out again. 

Didn’t enjoy the check in experience, person was cold and unwelcoming. Room was very average with a broken shower link, see picture! Really found that highly unprofessional and annoying. 

Walking distance from the airport, hotel provided shuttle service. So high in convenience, rest very average. ",3,2019,12,13
245,Late flight stopover,"Nice hotel, have to pay for car park, which isn’t advertised as an additional cost, bar is scary expensive for food and drink. But it has a very comfy bed, it’s pleasant airy and not too warm. Had a good sleep, which was the main thing really.",4,2019,12,10
245,Just a hotel close to the airport.,"It’s convenient if you have to be near the airport for your travel.  Not many options regardless so you kinda have to stay there.

245,Radisson Blu should drop this hotel,"Awful stay overall.  Poor from the word go and when problems are flagged, it depends on the staff member as to how things are resolved, there is no consistency and the quality of training must be highly questionable.  Does not feel like a Radisson Blu property, but some other organisation simply wearing a badge on the outside of the building.  The worst Radisson I have stayed in … twice over!",1,2019,11,28
245,"Good location, bit run down.","Terrific location in the centre of the airport.  Bus shuttle to the terminals, 4 times an hour, 24 hours a day, or you can walk to the terminals if you're prepared to pull your suitcase across a busy 5-lane access road.  (NOT recommended.)  Very affordable on a Friday night in November. Lots of space, both in the public areas and in the bedroom.  I asked for the most basic bedroom and what I got was almost a suite, in terms of size and furnishing. Very nice. Excellent breakfast. Friendly, professional staff. The bedroom needed refurbishment and the ambience of the lounge-bar was really poor - a charmless, gloomy space.  Tobacco smoke from the smokers outside the main door blew into the coffee lounge and was very noticeable. However, I'll likely be back for very early or very late flights if I can get a price as good as this.",3,2019,11,24
245,Overnight stay,Excellent location right by airport. First room provided had not been cleaned so had to get another. Bar was not serving draft beer. Food was very good but expensive. Rooms are well equipped and bed etc v comfortable ,3,2019,11,24
245,Good hotel and convenient for travel,"Good Hotel and room. Bar and Food could be improved in terms of variety, quality. Staff friendly. Location absolute key for early travel. Coffee and small snack at early leave. Good parking options that can be pre booked",4,2019,11,23
245,Great hotel but eat at the McDonalds,"I booked a room with a double bed but offered a twin room. Not what I wanted. The room was of excellent presentation, and I can't fault this, and the reception staff were welcoming and friendly, but they did not offer to change my twin room. So, that was a let-down.
Then the restaurant. I ordered fillet steak, cooked medium, and I was presented with a rare steak with rather disgusting fries, which had been cooked in oil too hot; hence, they were sticks of cooking oil.
The waiting staff were charming, but nobody checked my order was satisfactory. When they brought the bill, only then did they ask if the steak was okay. I told them it was under-cooked and the response was, ""Oh, you know what these chefs are like..."" 
I advised the reception staff at check-out that the on-duty chef should receive training, but I still paid the full amount, of course.
There's a McDonalds a short walk away from the hotel: I advise you to eat there. 
I'll be travelling to and from Dublin, on business, for the next twelve months, it's safe to say I won't be staying here.",3,2019,11,22
245,Average hotel,Average in all ways except location which was outstanding. We have stayed at other Dublin airport hotels in the past but decided to give the Radisson a chance this time as we had a 7am flight the next day. Shuttle service is great and an easy walk to T2 should you so desire. ,3,2019,11,19
245,Happy Customer,"The hotel & all staff were excellent. The size of the room was great, most of all it was so very convenient to get to the airport with complimentary shuttle bus. 
I would definitely recommend Radisson Blu",4,2019,11,18
245,Great place to stay and close to airport.,"I have stayed at this Radisson a number of times over the years.  The rooms are very nice, it is quiet, has great food options and is close to the airport.  The rental car company shuttles will even drop you off there after returning your vehicle the night before your flight.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,11,18
245,Radisson Dublin Airport,Very poor check in.  Not even eye contact. Very poor room   Poor bathroom. Manager should visit room once. Not even water in the room. Bar closes so early even on Friday night. Only best thing was check out. As if they want you out quick ,3,2019,11,17
245,Short stay for flight the next morning,"I had a 7am flight with Aer Lingus so my boyfriend and I decided to book a room the night before for easiness. We also had a ball to attend in south Dublin that night. Taxi from the hotel was quite affordable and quick ( as we went through Port tunnel ). Despite the lack of sleep due to the event that night, we had a great sleep and it was a pleasure to deal with hotel staff. We also had a very tasty meal for lunch. We will definitely treat ourselves to a stay at this hotel again, really was quite comfortable and totally worth the money.",5,2019,11,11
245,Great Stay,"I stayed here on the tail end of my trip to Dublin and it was my favorite accommodation of the trip hands down. The rooms are a great size, the amenities were fantastic and the staff were all very helpful. It's a great hotel and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. ",5,2019,11,11
245,Almost perfect stya,Hotel rooms are being refurbished which is wonderful. I stayed in a newly refurbished room and was very impressed. Especially the showers and the Nespresso machines are a nice touch. That being said here is the not so good part. My three other colleagues and I checked in and were told that breakfast was included in our rate so we were very confused when The next morning we were told that breakfast was not included and I was told by the girl checking me out that she had no idea how I got breakfast the first day in the first place which is not a pleasant answer. Aside from that very happy with the newly refurbished rooms but the staff need to work on their customer service skills.,5,2019,11,11
245,Return visit,"As usual, this hotel did not disappoint.  Five minute walk from the airport.  Friendly, professional staff.  Great rooms.  Fantastic breakfast!!  Always good to return to the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport Hotel.",5,2019,11,11
245,Pleasent Stay.,"It was very easy access to the Dublin Airport. I stayed with my family as they were supposed to catch a flight next morning. Breakfast was served on time. Staff was very friendly and supportive. It has everything. I highly recommend this hotel, specially if you are planning a departure from Dublin Airport. ",5,2019,11,10
245,Perfect for early flights,"So close to airport! Great hotel, so handy for them early morning flights. Got mini shuttle bus to airport with friendly and helpful driver, thats all you want at 4am in the morning ;) Few little breakfast snacks in the lobby was lovely!",5,2019,11,08
245,Business Trip,Very good hotel with lovely staff at the desk and in the restaurant. They were happy to print my boarding pass for me and my business agenda.  Restaurant staff remember their regulars and make a point og giving a warm welcome,5,2019,11,07
245,1 night stay.,"Not great value for money it costs. Rooms were not the best, very basic and used looking. Bar staff weren't particularly friendly and it couldn't find the quick breakfast on our way out for shuttle bus. Reception staff very friendly and shuttle bus was quick and on time.",3,2019,11,06
245,All we could want!,"We had an early flight out of Dublin Airport after our Irish trip, so it made sense to stay in an airport hotel. The Radisson Blu gave us all we needed. The first positive was Zita Murphy, the very helpful and pleasant Receptionist who booked us in (hope I’ve got the name right). She was an excellent ambassador for the hotel. The Reception area was light, bright and welcoming. Our room was perfectly acceptable - crisp fresh bedding and reasonably well appointed.  Another helpful Receptionist gave us clear and helpful advice about how best to get into the city centre. When we returned later that night, we had a coffee in the friendly and lively T3 bar. It was busy on a Saturday night.
Breakfast began interestingly. As directed, we “Waited Here To Be Seated” And waited....A very cordial man wearing a Radisson “beanie “ hat -clearly not a member of the waiting team - came into the restaurant and saw us waiting. He “owned” our problem, finding our room number on the breakfast list and finding us a waitress. He was equally cordial and efficient when he drove our shuttle bus to the airport later.
Breakfast was very good, especially the fresh fruit and the wheaten bread.
Some of the decor and decoration was a little tired, but the food, location and - especially - the employee team more than compensated. We would certainly return.

",4,2019,11,05
245,I DO NOT NORMALLY WRITE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ,"Went into Bar here yesterday (Bank Holiday) with the intention of having a snack lunch of some sort. 
Place was vertically empty with three staff. 
We sat at a table waiting for service and my daughter eventually went to the counter for menus. 
We asked if we could have sandwiches and were told that the Menu was what was available. 
My wife and I declined to have anything and my daughter ordered a Club Sandwich. 
I do not understand why an airport hotel cannot and do not offer just a plain sandwich and I also do not understand the total lack of service when the place was really quiet. 
People who read my reviews know that I am balanced and fair and I avoid negative reviews but the hotel is a disgrace bearing in mind it must get a lot of tourists. 
MalcolmG48",3,2019,10,29
245,Nice restaurant inside the hotel with a bad sleep,"Except for my hotel room which is very bad, old furnitures , poor mattress and old bathrooms, the restaurant and lobby bar was very nice, food very good and service great by the server.  They were easy to talk with and interested to communicate with the clientele",3,2019,10,28
245,Dublin airport hotel,It is in a great location to the hotel and comfortable for one night. The shuttle is a very convenient and short ride to the airport. The rooms are utilitarian and the lobby area is bright an roomy. We did not use any of the other facilities,4,2019,10,26
245,The T4 Bar is awesome !,"As a Platinum member I stay at this specific Radisson atleast 1 week every month now but much more frequently in the past while traveling for work. After a long day at work its always nice to find friendly waiters especially Dino (by now he already knows my order and pours me my fav. Smithwicks when he sees me walking down the hall 😊😊) at the T3 bar who can recommend you great food like the 6 oz. burger and the Louisiana wings 😁 Always nice as a returning customer seeing a friendly, familiar face at the bar!",5,2019,10,25
245,Overnight Stay,"Stayed here last night and Paid 180.00 Euro. Way over priced for the room I had. 
I was in a exclusive room on the 4th floor (or whatever they call it).
My room had a connecting door with the room next door. The door is not sound-proofed at all. I could hear every word the guy was saying on his phone call and his coughing during the night woke me up, basically like he was sleeping in the same room as me. 
Had better experience I much less costly hotels. ",2,2019,10,24
245,Excellent customer service & a great location,"A very short stay having arrived in the late evening with a connection the following morning. The staff were most courteous and professional and the staff member at check in deserves a mention here. The room was large, clean and comfortable. A refreshing sleep was had. The following morning a shuttle option is available over to the airport but I chose to walk the 5 minute walk over for some fresh air. Great location, great staff. ",4,2019,10,23
245,Convenience stay at Dublin Airport.,"This hotel is ‘tired’. Cracked sinks and a shower in the bath just don’t cut it. Especially when paying very high rates. Staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a buffet and ‘hot’ food is lukewarm. Good shuttle service (every 15 mins, 24 hours.)There are many better value and higher quality hotels for the rates charged by the Radisson.",3,2019,10,22
245,OK Experience,"Do not expect a lot of need a lot from a airport hotel.  Location, convenience and friendliness (except bar) was adequate.  I have nothing more to say....having spent the time to submit the survey (which  I want to submit without spending more time getting the minimum number of characters).",4,2019,10,21
245,Outrageously Overpriced ,"We did not have a good experience at this hotel. Upon arriving I was charged $90 over my original booking price, bringing the room to nearly $400 CAD. Keep in mind this hotel has no amenities. No pool on site.

With a small baby in tow we were given a room that was in a construction zone. When we complained we were offered a less superior room so we decided to stick it out. We then discovered dirty coffee cups and hair in the bathtub and sink. The free coffee service was briskly removed as we entered the lobby at 6am the next day. Come on!

The hotels only saving grace is their lovely restaurant staff and the amazing food. It was one of our best meals of the trip.",1,2019,10,20
245,"OK for an airport hotel,","Room was ok, view over the parking lot though, got a preffered room as radisson member. Food in restuarant was ok but not nothing spectacular. What was spectacular though was the engagement and attiude of every single member of staff I interacted with from front office to breakfast waiters. Big hands to mgmt and staff of this hotel",3,2019,10,18
245,Good Hotels,As always with Radisson the Dublin Airport Hotel it’s a top class stay in a good location in walking distance from the airport and polite helpful staff. I’ve always found the staff at the Dublin Hotel particularly helpful.,4,2019,10,18
245,Nice Changes !!,"I’ve stayed here on a number of occasions and have mostly been happy  with the standard of rooms and service. This time I got to stay in one of there newly refurbished premium rooms on the 5th Floor!! I was very impressed. The rooms are bright and spacious and packed full of luxury amenities and soft furnishings. Great pressure in the large rainfall shower. I love the dark furniture contrast to white walls. My only personal issue is the wooden floors, I am a fan of carpet in hotel rooms as the wood can be quite cold especially when your dashing to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Overall very well designed and nicely laid out. ",5,2019,10,17
245,2 nights in Dublin,"Experience was excellent, staff were pleasant and the room was comfortable.  Location was convenient to the airport, but you would need to take a taxi to the city center (or shuttle back to the airport to get a bus).  Given our short stay we opted for taxis. There was a free shuttle to and from the airport to the hotel.  Pick-up near arrivals and drop off at the departure terminal.  There was also a courtesy phone in arrivals to notify the hotel we had arrived to minimize shuttle wait time.  Wifi was great.  24hour room service.  Complimentary bottles of water.",5,2019,10,15
245,Could be better,"The room was large, clean and the bed was comfortable.  We had a premier room on the top floor.  No bath, only shower, which was disappointing.  The toilet roll holder was loose so the contents fell on the floor.  The basin tap was loose, although it worked.  Overall, I expect better from Radisson.  The dinner menu was so-so, but the fish chowder is excellent.  Breakfast was very good.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  Very convenient for the airport terminals.",3,2019,10,12
245,Average at best,"Ok for a overnight stay. Near the airport, but still had to take a shuttle. Uncomfortable and small bed. Staff at restaurant barely noticed guests were there and seemed preoccupied with many things, but not serving customers!",3,2019,10,11
245,Convenient Choice,"My daughter recently treated me to a city break, in Rome ,but due to the fact that we are from the north and our flight was at 6am , we felt that a relaxing night in the Radisson Blu Hotel was the perfect preparation for our trip.
The receptionist  was extremely friendly and helpful, plus the staff in both the restaurant and bar were very efficient. Special mention needs to be given to Megan ,in the restaurant, who recommended a beautiful Kapuka Sauvignon Blanc to accompany our meal, as well as her manageress who was also very attentive. I admit that food and drink are perhaps slightly overpriced but that’s the price you pay , I suppose , for convenience to the airport.
As regards our bedroom, it was quite spacious, the en-suite was very clean and the beds were comfortable. 
Due to the fact that we had to vacate the hotel at 4 am -too early for breakfast- we were pleasantly surprised to learn that free tea and coffee were available in the foyer. We also welcomed the convenience of the shuttle bus, from the front door because it was raining that morning! The driver was also very mannerly and insisted upon carrying our suitcases. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone in a similar situation because it saved us the stress of travelling for hours, for an early morning flight! 

",4,2019,10,10
245,So handy,"We stayed here the night before we were flying out to New York. I was so pleased we did as it was a relaxing experience. The breakfast next morning was out of this world. Cooked breakfast, cereal, tea, coffee, breakfast juices, toast and fresh fruit. Something for everyone. If you couldn't get something there something must be wrong.",5,2019,10,09
245,Room booking,"I had a room booked in this hotel fr Saturday 28 September fr 2 adults + 1 child.
I often use this hotel when leaving early am fr flight.
I had given debit card details to secure room.
Since I made the booking my bank issued a new master card so old debit card invalid.
So when I arrived at hotel reception on the Saturday evening & went to check in I informed the receptionist that there were only 2 adults needing the accomodation as child did not come. The receptionist informed me it didn't change the room rate as it was after 4 pm...so room rate was 167 & not the double rate of 147 which we were happy to pay....I was not happy so she called fr manager on duty who was not friendly & said he was not happy to accept the double rate so with that I advised him to cancel the booking as I knew my debit card was invalid due to bank issuing new card & he was quiet happy to loose the booking.....strange ..there were plenty of vacant rooms & fr the sake of 20 e he preferred to loose the booking  .
So we checked into the Maldron at a much cheaper rate of 129 & most enjoyable & had a lovely dinner all fr a very good rate.
Needless to say I will be checking into the Maldron hotel again fr early flight & has breakfast to go available in hotel lobby at no extra cost.",1,2019,10,08
245,A-1 Place to Stay,"Service at Reception was very welcoming and friendly; dining room staff excellent, server at T3 bar did his job, but not friendly or welcoming.  Location excellent, shuttle to airport every 15 minutes, and is a very short distance.  Shuttle driver very friendly. Short cab ride to Swords, to a large indoor mall.
Room was very adequate size, and everything about the room was A-1.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,10,07
245,Avoid this hotel if you have any other options,"This is one of the worst hotels I’ve stay in in quite a while.  I travel globally on a regular basis.  Despite the price of this hotel being 140€ for a night, it is run down, dirty, and extremely outdated.  I don’t mind a no-frills hotel, particularly when I just need an overnight stay before a morning flight.  The toiletries were cheap, the walls and table were scratched up.  Even the nice picture on the fall of a couple kissing was wrinkled on the inside. The room is so outdated that there isn’t a single USB plugin.  Apart from all of the foregoing, is amazing that there are no electrical outlets anywhere near the bed.  This is not the only hotel to do that; other cheap hotels do that as well to try and avoid having their customers use electricity.  The problem is that I use a CPAP machine that I travel with.  It I can’t use the machine, I could die.  This was a very stressful situation.  Using some ingenuity, I figured out that the bed is on wheels and I was able to roll the bed away all the way from the wall and then I could plug into the outlet on the other side of the room, arranging the pillows so I would be sleeping in the other direction.  Unfortunately, I needed an adaptor that could be used in Ireland so I called down to the front desk to request one that I could borrow.  I was told “sorry”, they gave them all to other customers.  I then was able to slide the bed over even further along the wall and, because my CPAP machine has a long chord, was able to extend the chord to the bathroom shaver outlet – but apparently it has different voltage levels and my CPAP cut out 15 minutes later.  Despite having 7 hours to sleep before I had to leave to the airport, I woke up as if I hadn’t slept at all and spent my entire flight back to the U.S. feeling crappy and exhausted.  Summarizing, this hotel is horrible for travelers and I would not recommend it to anyone that has time to book a different hotel.  It is very close to the airport, so they’re able to drawing in business because of that.  It’s 2019.  Too bad the hotel is still set up as if it was a cheap motel from the 1950’s.",1,2019,10,07
245,Hotel is just okay,Overall the hotel is okay and the better of the two at the airport.  The top floor has been renovated and is excellent.  Lower floor rooms need updating.  The public areas and restaurants are fine and staff are friendly.  Check-in process is particularly slow and the check-out process is just okay.  Sometimes the prices are quite high and the hotel is not a good value for the money.,3,2019,10,06
245,Film awards,A great hotel to stay in while travelling. Very convenient to airport and the shuttle service is very good. Check in was easy. Staff were friendly and restaurant was very good. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2019,10,05
245,Great for a pre-flight stay,"We booked a premium room here, which I believe is the same size as a standard room, but recently renovated and on a high floor (what can I say, I like watching the planes). The bedroom itself was nicely decorated and well laid out, and they kindly gave us an airport view as requested. The bathroom was newly renovated and modern but very small, and as usual I needed more shelf space (or a hook on the door would have been helpful). Great walk-in shower, really good coffeemaker, and a nice heated towel rack, although it was difficult to reach above the toilet.

The hotel is unusual in that you can’t just pull over in front and drop off bags. Instead, you must enter the large ticketed parking lot, and then use a machine in the hotel lobby to pay for parking before you leave the parking lot. It’s free for the first 20 minutes, which is plenty of time for dropping off, and after that I think it was 2 euros per hour. We found it handy to park, check in to the hotel, and then return our car to the car rental without having to deal with luggage. The car rental we used (Enterprise) was happy to shuttle us back to the Radisson rather than the airport.

We had planned to walk from the Radisson to the airport in the morning, but we found it was a 15 minute walk to Terminal 1 without bags, maybe 10 minutes to Terminal 2, so we ended up taking the hotel shuttle instead. It leaves every 15 minutes, which makes for a short wait. 

There are three dining options at this Radisson, and we ate at two of them- snacks and coffee at the Lounge, and dinner at Collage. Food and drinks were good, and the staff we encountered at both the restaurants and hotel were helpful and friendly. Overall we had a good stay here.",4,2019,10,04
245,Our Stay at the Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport,"Very convenient to the car rental drop off and easy access to the airport terminals. Easily found shuttles and cabs to visit Dublin center and restaurants, Temple Bar and shopping centers.  Staff were very knowledgeable and good at explaining how to get around Dublin.  ",5,2019,10,03
245,Great Room,"Delightful room with great view of the flight path and Airport.
Room service excellent as we arrived late.
The breakfast on this occasion wasn't up to the normally fantastic standard but this   comment is made because of that high standard.
Will of course return.
",5,2019,10,02
245,Pleasant stay,"This hotel is conveniently located in close proximity to both terminals and the hotel shuttle is available every 15 mins. The room was quiet and comfortable and readily accessible (unlike the Maldron) and the staff courteous and friendly. 
My preferred hotel at Dublin airport.",4,2019,10,01
245,Ok,Food was very disappointing and overpriced breakfast was cold toast was completely white in color bacon over cooked cold and chewy scrambled eggs were cold room was ok felt more like a standard room I paid for superior ok overall but food was very very disappointing ,4,2019,09,30
245,Very Close to Airport,"I had an early flight back to the US after 10 days in the country so stood at the Radisson Blu.  The first thing to mention is airport hotels in Dublin are twice what they are near Heathrow, so before I booked I was a little put off.  However, this is throughout all of Dublin, so not a reflection on just this hotel.  

You can see Terminal 2 from the airport and I decided to walk it as the weather was nice.  It took me all of 4 minutes with luggage.  It is very close and no shuttle is needed, though one is provided.  

Check in went smoothly.  They had a lunch buffet available which I had.  They have a grab and go breakfast of fruit, granola bars and coffee in the early morning starting at 4 am as well.  The rooms are quiet, which is the most important thing being this close to the airport.  Overall, it was  good choice and would stay here again.",4,2019,09,29
245,Radisson Dublin Airport experience,"Nice hotel, great location, nice bars & restaurant, very good & clean rooms. Good shuttle service to the airport. I left an item of clothing in the wardrobe at 6am, and called the hotel one hour later to ask them to recover it for me so I could collect it later that evening. They promised they would but didn’t follow through which was disappointing. Still haven’t added my reward points either in spite of assurances given.",3,2019,09,26
245,Perfect for early morning flight out of DUB,"We stayed there for our last night in Dublin before catching an early morning flight. It offers free shuttle, clean room and that was good with us. I would avoid the Restaurant food as it was so so. Looking around the Airport for hotels this was probably the best choice.",4,2019,09,26
245,Excellent hotel stay ,"The superior room we stayed in was very spacious, clean and newly furnished. The bed was very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was really good, with a good variety of warm food, bread, scones and juices. There’s free shuttle buses from Dublin airport terminal 1 and 2. From terminal 1, it’s at carpark booth 8. ",5,2019,09,25
245,Comfortable and friendly,As always our night before flying out on holiday was relaxing... a great start to our break.. reception friendly and efficient ... didn’t have long to wait for shuttle bus ... room service was quick and food was delicious... ,5,2019,09,25
245,Rudest an most unhelpful people in Ireland are employed here,"Customer service is extremely important to us and is rated higher than all other aspects of a hotel. With the exception of one young male waiter in the restaurant (wish we had caught his name, he was lovely) the staff at this hotel were rude, unaccommodating, aloof and really put a damper on an otherwise extremely lovely vacation. Our experience started with the front desk staff yelling at my husband because they needed us to move our car. The signage at the entrance was VERY unclear where we could park to check in, so our only choice was for me to stay in the car in the shuttle bus spot while my husband ran in. Rather than politely asking us to move (or better yet having a sign directing us to the free parking to the left of the hotel, the front desk associate continued to yell at my husband for us to MOVE THAT CAR, and never told us where we could move to. They also would not let him get a word in to even ask where to move the car. After checking in, we found towels in our room that appeared soiled, when we asked the maid service for a clean towel they begrudgingly accommodated us, but not after telling us that the towels were not dirty and we were being absurd.  The bar staff had to be hailed continually to get service and were not friendly or congenial. The treatment that we received at this hotel was RADICALLY different from all other hotels and restaurants that we had visited in Ireland. Everywhere else we felt welcomed At the Radisson we felt like a burden to the staff. Some serious customer service training is needed at this hotel. ",1,2019,09,24
245,Acceptable Hotel at the Airport,"We decided to stay here after a good experience at the Radisson Blu in the Manchester, UK airport. The one in Dublin is not as glamourous. A courtesy van shuttles guests from the terminals to the hotel. We could not find the stop outside the international terminal and had to drag our bags to the domestic one. Turns out that the airport only allows the company one small sign on a pole, which we missed. The driver was friendly and helpful, like the rest of the hotel staff. 

There are pluses and minuses with the rooms. After landing we stayed in a rather small “superior” room. There were no outlets beside the bed. My companion uses a CPAP machine, but fortunately, being an experienced traveler, he brought a UK/ Irish extension cord with him. It took us a while to figure out how to turn on the heated towel rack. Probably every Irish person knows how to do this, but instructions would help us foreign visitors. There was no hair dryer in our room and the furniture was somewhat tired.

Prior to departure we stayed in a “premier” room, the next grade up. This had been recently renovated and was much nicer, with a compact bathroom with walk-in shower and lighted mirror, a bench to support luggage, both a table and a desk so my companion and I could spread out without competition, and ample outlets at each of the two bedside tables. However, we stayed two nights and one day. Our room was not made up by 4:00 P.M. on the day. Annoying. In general, service here is erratic.

Given that this is an airport hotel, it should be noted that airplane noise is not bothersome, especially when the soundproofing curtains are closed.

The Irish and/or continental breakfast buffet is excellent, and there is an agreeable bar with good snacks (including pizza) available after 6 PM. A café serving sandwiches and salads is open between lunch and dinner. I recommend this hotel, but when making a reservation be sure to specify one of the renovated rooms.",3,2019,09,22
245,Walk to the Departure Lounge,"Ok it might be 1/4 mile but you could walk it. Saw many that did. Not to worry though. They have a shuttle running every 15 minutes so leave the driving to them. Nice place, kind of loud with plane traffic, but good windows and curtains reduce 90% of the noise. Stayed 2 days. Ate 4 meals. Trip to the Zoo by taxi. Basic tourist stuff. And a few drinks in the bar - no set schedule there.",4,2019,09,21
245,Fine for business travel close to airport,"I was barely there two nights, arrived 11p Wednesday and left 4a Friday.   This is a dated and basic hotel but very convenient for late/early flights.  The bar and restaurant were good.  The service was outstanding.  There is no gym on site.",3,2019,09,20
245,Awful Bed and Attitude,"Pay £200 for a night and get a fold out bed from the wall! Mattress was so thin every spring could be felt. Room was set up a meeting room, not a bedroom. Complained at checkout and they were not particularly interested. Lots of other hotel choices around the airport of better quality and lower price.",2,2019,09,19
245,"Cold, soulless room","This is not a nice hotel! Everything looks slightly jaded and in need of renovation, and the rooms resemble a 1-star hotel, containing the absolute bare minimum in terms of furniture, features and decoration. Radisson clearly takes the approach that they will always get the customers here because it's an airport hotel and there's always a demand - so they don't bother fixing it up. Over 200 EUR per night for this crumby standard room is a total rip-off. It should be more in the 100 EUR range, if that. On the plus side, the staff are kind and helpful - so please give them something worthwhile to work with Radisson!",2,2019,09,16
245,Smooth and enjoyable,"Efficient and comfortable, with food above the norm. A pricier choice for Dublin Airport but also above average experience. My preferred option for Dublin Airport travel. Beds and food above average. Shuttle pick-up at Terminals needs to be improved - better signage and stop where supposed to. In fairness to the Hotel, this is also a Airport Authorities issues with Bus set down areas. Only the ""Airport Staff Shuttle"" is clearly marked and consistently stops in own designated spot :-)  ",4,2019,09,15
245,Rad Blu Dublin Airport,"Good place to overnight if you are flying out in the morning from Dublin.  The rooms have been updated and are well appointed.  I love the location because I can drop my rental car, walk to the hotel, get a nice dinner, a great nights sleep and then walk to the Terminal in the morning.",5,2019,09,15
245,Convenient location to airport,"Very convenient location to airport and staff was friendly.  Property was a bit tired and could use a remodel, though space was adequate for 3 people in a room.  Hotel restaurant was fine though nothing particularly memorable (very typical for airport hotels). For price, wasn't best value compared to other places we stayed in Ireland.",3,2019,09,14
245,Lovely,"Friendly staff , good food great location great value for money and ha day free shuttle to both terminals , rooms are quiet spacious and beds are so comfortable, definitely will be back to stay again soon next time ",5,2019,09,12
245,"Nice, clean, free breakfast, free shuttle ","I enjoyed my stay here. It’s at the airport, I actually walked to it (about 10min) from terminal 2 if you have nice day. But if you’re not up to a walk there is a free shuttle. My room was large and the windows opened a crack to get some good airflow which I personally love. It took 30 euro split between friends to get down to the city but well worth it and not a long trek. Breakfast was free and ample! They even had packaged Gluten Free bread in the selections which is rare in my travels. All staff was helpful and accommodating. Wouldn’t mind another stay if I’m here for business again. ",4,2019,09,10
245,Really nice hotel,Great hotel with friendly and professional staff. Perfect location for Dublin Airport and free shuttle. Rooms are spacious. Hotel in general was nice and clean. Bars and restaurant were very cozy and reasonable ,5,2019,09,09
245,Unhappy with stay!,"Although the staff were lovely & the restaurant was amazing, we were quite unhappy at the fact we could constantly smell airplane fuel within our room even with the windows closed. I’m not sure if this is because our room was facing the airport but myself and my partner both felt physically sick in the morning from the smell of fuel. I think it would be worth while to check and update ventilation and air quality as this could cause illness to customers. Also this airport was more pricey as it’s the radisson but you would expect better air quality within the hotel for the price we paid. ",1,2019,09,09
245,Bad for the brand,"The hotel location is the best thing about this place, it’s old and run down, had a third floor superior room and half the lights didn’t work and we had only one working free plug. The fire alarm went off in the afternoon and woke us from our sleep. We dressed and evacuated only to discover it was a drill, the staff were suppose to notify us and didn’t. 
The only place to get a soft drink in this hotel is at the bar or restaurant, it costs €3 for 200ml and it’s not chilled. The restaurant service itself is awful. We ordered salads and bread and the bread never arrived and one of the salads arrived wrong. The restaurant staff were unwelcoming overall. ",2,2019,09,08
245,Very Handy for early morning flight ,"We had an early morning flight out so we stayed the night here. The room was very comfortable. It had a fridge, a safe and a coffee machine. The food was very tasty in the restaurant. We were able to leave the car in the Carpark while we were on holidays. It has a free courtesy bus every 15 minutes to both terminals. Walking to Terminal 2 would take about 10 minutes. We will stay here again. ",4,2019,09,06
245,Radisson Blu Hotel Dublin,I was very grateful for the friendliness and courtesy of the staff when staying at the Radisson recently. I was travelling from Australia  on my own at the time and feeling a little uncertain in unfamiliar territory. The Radisson was a welcome break and the staff most helpful and friendly. ,5,2019,09,05
245,Very pleasantly surprised!,"Usually stay here before our early flight back to the US. Stayed last night in a recently remodeled room, which was very comfortable, and had the appropriate amenities. The real surprise was the improved restaurant. Usually airport hotel restaurants are acceptable at best. Radisson has recently remodeled their restaurant, including a new menu and probably a new chef.  We were very impressed and had a meal that we would have expected at a nice restaurant. We had pan seared scallops with pea purée and black pudding. The scallops were great, while I wouldn’t have paired black pudding with the scallops, it worked out well. Also had salt and pepper calamari along with a cheese plate for desert. The new menu is very interesting with more than just pub and bar food.  They have some interesting cocktails which were very good.  No need to leave the airport for excellent food.  Front desk was very friendly and the shuttle was on time. All and all and excellent way to end our trip.",5,2019,09,04
245,Their 5th floor Premier rooms are good,"It was nice, at last, to stay in one of their newly refurbished Premier rooms on the 5th floor. Nicely designed room and bathroom with large walk in shower. Very clean and comfortable - quite a difference to the Premier rooms I’ve had here before which were shabby and had broken pieces of furniture ",4,2019,09,04
245,RadissonBlu Dublin Airport,"RadissonBlu Dublin Int’l Airport - hotel is ok for business trips that involve early morning flights. However, rooms are poorly furnished with a very uncomfortable bed and poor amenities. The bathroom hasn’t been renovated for more than 10 years. Staff is friendly and helpful. No value for money considering this is a 4 star hotel.",2,2019,09,02
245,Poor Value,"Booked this hotel last minute as my usual preferences were fully booked. The room was charger as ‘Premium Room - High Floor’ as there were no others available, however I was placed in an access room, on the first floor - hardly premium. The hotel is dated and in need of refurbishment. Yes, it is an airport hotel, but that is no excuse. The reception staff were the only staff I had contact with during my stay. They were professional but lacked any sort of personality. Beds were uncomfortable and pillows were in need of replacement - clumpy and hard. Sufferable when in need of a bed for the evening, otherwise, avoid.",2,2019,09,01
245,A great choice,"The other times when I stayed near Dublin Airport it was in a hotel a couple of miles away which has a 24 hour shuttle service. But a change of ownership, and recent experiences of rowdy customers and heaving crowds at check-in made me re-think. For not much more I was able to stay at the Radisson and, compared to the off-site mayhem, it was an oasis. 

I was frustrated by the Radisson's shuttle service. Having waited half an hour on arrival, and only getting the shuttle to show up by calling hotel reception, and a similar situation at the hotel, when the driver disappeared out of reach of staff, I decided to check out the alternative. Although neither the airport nor the hotel advertises it, it is perfectly possible to walk between the terminals and the hotel, using sidewalks and traffic lights. From the terminals, head in the general direction of the DAA building and keep your eye on the hotel. 

In summary: very comfortable room; decent food; a pleasant bar - and a comfortable walk to and from the terminal - this is where I will stay in future.",5,2019,09,01
245,Eeep up the good work!,"Everyone is super friendly, which is great after a 14 hour flight. I only wish the folks that I asked could have helped me figure out a bus or otherwise cheap way to travel into town/ had an recommendations on where to go (both kid friendly and otherwise). I got a lot of ""Oh, I'm not really from around here"" or ""Actually, I'm not too sure on that. Let me see if I can find out"" only never to find them/ hear from them again. But the restaurant/ bar options just down in the lobby are great. They really are fine, considering I really only stay in Ireland- near the airport- typically less than 20 hours, sometimes as few as 8. ",4,2019,08,30
245,"After staying here many times, I won't be again, worst stay.","I stayed here many times, pleasant enough and good service. This seems to be a thing of the past. Rudest bar staff, even after paying the service fee for room service they have the cheek of asking me for a tip. I paid alot of money to treat my family to be here before our flight. Instead of a nice time I'm treated like scum. The Radisson blue special members card means nothing here. This card seems to be a curse and I don't want it anymore. Certainly has left an everlasting impression of Radisson Blu Dublin airport.",1,2019,08,30
245,Great nights sleep,"This was a great hotel and comfy, quiet rooms. Walk across street to airport, great location. A little on pricey side but I guess it was worth it for the convenience of being so close to hotel and rental car dropoff.",5,2019,08,28
245,Waste of Money,Really not impressed with this hotel at all. Service wasn't great. Don't expect them to accommodate your dietary needs. Location advertised as being close to airport i.e walking distance but I still had to take a shuttle. Would never stay here again given the other options around. ,2,2019,08,27
245,Easy access to airport,"Easy access to airport, with frequently running shuttle bus.
The room was nice and quiet and I got a good nights sleep.
A fridge in the room was unexpected and a very useful extra.
The view from my room ( 129) wasn't great!
",4,2019,08,26
245,Great room,"I really enjoyed my stay here, I was only here for one night but the room was amazing and breakfast was so good! My room was 178 for the night inc breakfast which might be expensive but if you need to stay by the airport I think it’s worth it as the room was so nice 👍 ",5,2019,08,25
245,Aug 2019,"Good. However disappointed by the heating in room, quality of shower and lack of vegetarian options at breakfast (no vegetarian sausage for example).

The shower really lacked power and the heating system just would not work properly.

245,All the warmth and craic of solitary confinement on an oil rig.,"Dublin is the capital city of a nation renowned for its love of partying, socialising and welcome to strangers. 
So it is rather mystifying why the Radisson are doing here, since their policy is to close all bars and restaurants at 11 p.m. sharp, which was the first thing I was told as I checked in (""Welcome to our hotel! Everything is closed""). Having arrived at my room about ten minutes past the magic hour, I decided to try and order some wine off the room service menu, so lifted the phone and asked for the Albarino. Not available, I was told. Never mind, I'll have the Rioja. Not available either. OK, why not the Italian red -Not available, my interlocutor broke in. After a brief pause to compose myself, I asked him if he could just tell me what WAS available. He opted instead to explain why the drinks I had asked for that weren't available were unavailable, before eventually grudgingly conceding that there was a bottle of wine which was actually available. I have had less hassle getting a drink in pious Muslim countries...",2,2019,08,24
245,old stinky hotel with broken toilet loud noise and poor wi-fi,the only reason and good thing about this hotel was its proximity to the airport and the free shuttle bus that runs every 15 minutes. i stayed here because i arrived at 10p an had to fly out early next morning but wouldn't recommend it otherwise,2,2019,08,23
245,Our stay at radison,"treat you customers like you want them to return. Provide value or don't charge for it.
It was a bad experience and Managment could have taken care of it much better to earn our loyalty
All of my other hotel chains would have offered something - like a room comp - to make up for their ability to provide us an adequate room.",2,2019,08,19
245,Safety and service concerns,"The service was incredibly slow in the restaurant. We were left wait what seemed forever at every stage. We asked 3 times for a desert menu and still did not get one. 
In the interim a member of staff broke a glass that shattered everywhere and didn't do anything about it immediately even though there were children running around. Eventually they started cleaning it up with a hairy mop. Glass with a mop??? And pushed it to the side still in a public area. There was still other glass on the ground that posed a danger to patrons. My sister gave out about the delay as it was just beyond acceptable. 
We left the restaurant. The remaining glass was still on the floor. We went to the bar and found them very friendly. We finally got desert there after over 45 minutes at least. 
We were offered 20% off our restaurant bill after complaining about the service but I think that is just white washing the serious service and safety issues. 
I will not be returning",2,2019,08,16
245,The playwright Bar,"Laura was a wonderful server at this busy bar in the Clayton Hotel near the airport in Swords, Dublin Co., Ireland. She ensured that our drinks and food were perfect and as ordered and made adjustments when they were not. She is personable and a wonderful ambassador for both the hotel and for Ireland. ",5,2019,08,15
245,best and most convenient hotel for Dublin airport,"the Radisson is my favourite hotel. Clean, airy, friendly staff. I would like an option for a lighter duvet or bed cover and a softer pillow. Otherwise perfect. (except as noted, was surprised to have to pay for my overnight car parking).",5,2019,08,14
245,One small worm ruins the barrel,"Very pricy, but conveniently at the airport.  Service, food, room all very good.  We asked to weigh our bags and they pointed to a scale in the lobby that takes 1 euro coins.  The weight only shows for 15 seconds.  The first euro shows kg.  The second euro, when we switched to lbs, showed stones/lbs/ozs.  We consulted google and got the desire kg.  Third euro got the weight.  Took some items out and got within 50 lbs on the fourth euro.  For both bags probably 7 euro.  We dropped a lot of money at the hotel.  it just grates that they would try to pick up a few extra euro from the machine in the lobby.  When we stayed at an Irish hotel in Cork on the last trip, they charged nothing to use a scale they use for internal use.",1,2019,08,11
245,1 night stay with baby before flight,This hotel is in the perfect location for an easy start to the day on an early departure flight. Waking distance to T2 and has cheap onsite parking if required overnight. We stayed with our 10 month old and everything was perfect including the free upgrade to premium,5,2019,08,11
245,Nice and comfortable,"For an early flight, it was very comfortable to stay so close to the Terminal. With two duvets for a doubleroom it had been perfect. We ask twice at the reception, but there was no deaction.
In the Restaurant the Service could be better Organized.
",5,2019,08,11
245,Good proximity to the airport,"Not a nice hotel for the price, but was convenient for early morning departure from Dublin airport. Overall the hotel was dark, dingy and worn. WiFi in the room did not work. Shuttle service was dependable, and the driver was friendly and helpful.",3,2019,08,10
245,Overpriced,"Nice hotel, but it's a ripoff for what's included...it really seems that this hotel realises that people travelling early from Dublin airport have no real choice but to get a hotel nearby, so charges ridiculous rates to stay there...really greedily squeezing the customer for every last cent that they can...",3,2019,08,09
245,Disappointing ,"My partner and I were travelling to family in Southern Ireland and as result of business meetings we flew in to Dublin at different times. We booked Radisson Blu because it was on the Airport Campus and location suited us.  I checked in first on the Sunday evening around 6pm and requested late checkout for the following day as my partner was due to arrive the following morning and would need to rest before we embarked on our journey down the South of Ireland.  
I was informed at reception by very nice receptionist that normal checkout was 1pm and after that time there would be a charge of €50 for late checkout up to 5pm. I thanked them for the information and informed them that we would checkout at 3pm.  
I then found out that parking was not complimentary for residents but a reduced charge is available. The hotel staff on reception were very polite friendly and helpful. Hotel spotlessly clean.  Premier room 4th Floor, very spacious bedroom but extremely small bathroom.  Floorboards lifting on floor near window and large circular floor rug placed over it to hide the issue.  Coffee machine leaked water all over the counter area in the bedroom and despite requesting someone to come and look at it, no one arrived.  On a plus, comfortable bed.

Finally, my partner arrived off an 11 Hour flight at 9.20am and made it over to the hotel around 10am. He slept for couple of hours and at 12pm there was loud knocking on the door with a male staff member shouting through the door asking what time we intended checking out. I responded through the door saying we were on late checkout and the reply came back saying “yes we know but approx what time are you leaving” I said 3pm and there was no further correspondence. 
As result of this intrusion my husband was wide awake with no hope of getting more sleep and so we decided to checkout and get on the road.  
At 12.50pm we went down to reception to checkout and pay the bill and found an additional €50 had already been charged for late checkout. I pointed out fact we were in fact leaving early and got this credited back on to my credit card. I was very disappointed that no one thought to call the room rather than banging loudly and repeatedly on the door and shouting through it from the corridor, waking my husband and announcing our checkout arrangements for all to hear. Very unprofessional. ",4,2019,08,05
245,Another good sleep but food wasn’t the best,"Had an early morning flight so stayed the night before. Check in was great, room was on the first floor. Room and bathroom were very clean, most important. Could do with extra USB ports by the beds. Went for dinner, waited quite a while to be seated even though we were seen and only ones waiting. Waiter wasn’t very pleasant and barely spoke, quite rude really. The selection was only ok for me and expensive. The kids choices looked much nicer. Had an early night. The beds are were comfortable and I nodded off quickly. I did wake very early with lots of noise from other guests leaving their rooms. It’s always my first choice when I stay at the airport but there are some updates that would benefit it.",5,2019,08,05
245,Service in bar - OMG so bad!,"Hotel fine but the service in the bar was terrible. Bloke behind the bar obviously had major chip on his shoulder and tension between him and girl serving tables. Major training needed, even not pouring the Guinness first on an order.",1,2019,08,02
245,Ehhhh.... not great,"Mediocre room for a premium price. No outlets by the bed, all the outlets don’t work, tub & shower awkward. Asked for a fan and they were all out - but wasn’t told for almost an hour after the front desk had told me it “was on the way up” 
Breakfast nice - not included.",2,2019,07,31
245,Nice looking but lacking in several areas,"A nice looking and nicely appointed hotel near the airport.  Very clean!  Some areas lacking.  They do not have a proper bar, the complimentary ride to the airport let us off about a mile from our proper gate.  The front desk attitudes were from very friendly to a wee bit surly.  The bell hops or guys working on the curb outside the entrance were a lot of fun to talk to and they did have some good advice about local places to visit.",3,2019,07,30
245,Great...except for the bus.,"This hotel is what you would expect from the Radisson Blu brand. Newer, modern decorations. Nice clean rooms with good space.  The breakfast was very good and included with the price for an extra 20 euros or so. 

The only real problem I found was the airport shuttle bus. It was old and small. To avoid waiting for another 20 minutes or so, we had to sit on top of one another. The seats were held together with copious amounts of duct tape and some of the seat belts were hard to find since the retaining plastic was broken off. I was so surprised I thought we had gotten the wrong hotel since that bus wasn't worthy of a 2-star motel. Someone needs to realize they are really damaging their brand when that's the first impression people get of the hotel. It would be an easy fix too. Some of the artwork in the hotel probably cost more to purchase and display than a lightly used new airport van, but it would do so much more to improve the guest experience. I wish I'd thought to take a photo.",4,2019,07,29
245,Poor Maintenance,Our room was poorly lit due to light bulbs being out. Bathroom could have been cleaner. The shower spray was low pressure. The toilet only flushed occasionally. Our check in clerk was confused and tried to charge us for two nights until my husband showed him our confirmation for 1 night. Location. Next to airport was why we chose this hotel for our next morning flight. Location was satisfactory. Breakfast was good. ,2,2019,07,29
245,Past it's prime,The hotel is dated and the rooms need a refresh. The service was good with efficient check in and out. The early morning grab and go breakfast is nothing but poor coffee and granola bars. Shuttle service was good with frequent trips at all hours and friendly drivers. Next time I'll pick an hotel close but not in the DUB airport: probably get a better value for a short taxi ride.,3,2019,07,28
245,Rescued by the Radisson.,"After our other plans had fallen through and we had been turned away by other hotels, we were saved by the Radisson.
The friendliness and professionalism of the staff (from check in to bar to room service to the dining staff) were terrific.
The quality of the food was first rate and the room met all of our needs and then some.",5,2019,07,27
245,Bad nights sleep,"Might have been just my room, but bed was horrendous. Old and uncomfortable, could feel the base of the bed through the mattress, no support. Given hotel is situated beside airport and primary guests are those about to travel or have landed, a good nights sleep is the bread and butter this type of hotel should get correct. I have had better beds in hostels. ",2,2019,07,25
245,Avoid Room 131,"We booked our room many months ago.
On arrival last night we were given a wheelchair accessible room.
There was a constant noise from outside the window ( air con/ heating unit)
Neither of us got ANY sleep.
We will not be staying in this Radisson again as I informed Reception this a m.

245,Overcharged !,Stayed my first night before the PGA open. Everything was great. Missed my flight home so I went back to the hotel. At the counter they charged me $100 more than the current internet price and $100 more the my first night. MAKE SURE YOU BOOK ONLINE.....,3,2019,07,24
245,Nice clean hotel good location,"Nice clean hotel, friendly staff and very good location close too the airport. However for just a lay over flight a bit expansive. There is a transfer bus but we walked there in 10 minutes. Also tot early flights there is a take away breakfast (batman/ Apple and muesli bars and coffee or tea. ",4,2019,07,23
245,"Wifi was not good, pull out bed not comfy, otherwise it was ok","Wifi essentially didnt work at all, so having 2 teenagers, that was a serious fail. Our family of 4 stayed in 1 room, two of us on a pull out bed which was really lumpy, tiny and uncomfortable. Other than that, the hotel is clean, people are very nice, continental breakfast was free and great, multiple airport shuttles run every 15 mins and its really quick and easy to get to the airport. ",3,2019,07,21
245,Staff amazing,Staff were all very helpful and friendly. Restaurant staff very accommodating of our 3 kids while were tired after a long flight. Excellent location only 5 minutes. Will stay again when flying from Dublin.,5,2019,07,21
245,Radisson Blu review,General stay was perfect. Problem was I had an adjoining room and the next door neighbors tried to enter my room in the middle of the night. There was also some noisy guests as well that made sleep difficult. I am a light sleeper in unknown places so I was not able to achieve a good night's sleep.,4,2019,07,20
245,I rated a 3 as this cannot be a 4 star property ,"I’m confused!, I stay in hotels both for work and vacation yet I still do not know how establishments are star graded. I did expect a 4 star from the Radisson Dublin Airport today but indeed it could not be considered so in its entirety. On the plus side, an excellently located hotel with excellent check in provided by pleasant and welcoming staff.  However when ones leaves reception the attention to detail degrades to very low levels. I’m sure the international Radisson brand must have standards but I failed to see them. 
Scuffed room doors, over painted carpet and fittings, electrical fittings not working, unclean bathroom areas all brought the standard down. Readers may wonder why I did not complain. If it was a case of the tv not working sure I would but in instances where the overall care and attention to the room is so low level, another room may just be the same. Review the pictures attached.  Very,very disappointed Radisson Blu and I’m just about happy to award you a three star. ",3,2019,07,13
245,Stay away from room 123 if you are looking for a view! Otherwise it is fine.,"For starters, our first impression of this hotel was not favorable as the desk person was rude, curt and basically just going through the motions and clearly did not want to be there dealing with people such as ourselves. When I got to the room and checked it out, we found the room we got was obviously well used as there was damage to 2 lamps, stains on the chairs, very little art on the walls (which made the room very echo chamber-like), other damage to the ironing board and tv table, mildew around the bathroom ceiling, etc. I have pictures if you would like to see these things! But let's not forget the VIEW from our window! I have worked in industrial settings and I almost thought I was back at work looking at the HVAC system, except that this area was dirty, unkempt and looked to be about to fail! I did talk to a different desk person, who was at least polite, about the condition of the room, mostly so that I would not be charged for the damages. They said they would note my concerns and informed me that the facility is undergoing some ""refurbishing"". They offered to move us to another room, but would not offer any rebate or discount. I declined their offer as we had my wife's disabled son very close by, (we were in #123 and he was in #119) and we were already getting settled after a tiring cross country drive from County Mayo.  The restaurants get a mixed review in my book. T3 was okay, the staff there were a bit clueless and slow, but got our order of pizza and nachos to us in a timely manner. The pizza was passable. The nachos on the other hand were horrible. Someone needs to get a lesson in how to build a plate of nachos, as this item was disgusting. There were many things wrong with this item, but most importantly if you offer guacamole and all you can come up with is CANNED guacamole, don't pour it on top of the the item, therefore making the item even less palatable. Also the salsa should be on the side, not mixed in with the tortilla chips. The Collage restaurant was probably the saving grace of my experience at this Radisson. We had opted for the included breakfast buffet when we made the reservation. The variety and freshness of the food, along with the cheerful, helpful, both front of house and back of house, staff, helped to make this stay tolerable. In general, our stay was fine and MOST of the staff were polite and friendly.",3,2019,07,11
245,disappointing,"I know I caught them on a bad night, but there was no running water when I checked in. Only one reception desk was open, so it was a pretty long wait to check in, and getting a beer was an adventure. If I had known I would have skipped it.",2,2019,07,10

245,Brief Stay,"Excellent facility, professional staff, excellent service.  I appreciated the shuttle bus service to the airport.  I wish I had known how to catch the shuttle bus at the airport the very late Saturday night that I arrived.  Breakfast was very good, with appropriate options.",5,2019,07,09
245,Excellent Hotel.,"We stayed one night only in a junior suite and cannot fault anything about this hotel.
The suite was massive, huge bathroom with a separate bath and also a second seperate toilet.
Bed was so comfortable with good quality linens.
Had a drink in the bar and dinner in the restaurant, the food and service was great in both areas.
Smooth checkin and checkout by smiley friendly reception crew.
As we had an early flight we opted to take the shuttle to the terminal however it is within easy walking distance if you wish.
Can highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,08
245,One of the best Airport Hotels we have stayed in,"The Radisson Dublin Airport is a great place to stay. Really convenient to airport, it is an easy walk if wished but the shuttle is also readily available. The staff were great and there were plenty of refreshments available for a quick snack on arrival and leaving. Would definitely use this hotel again. ",5,2019,07,07
245,Good quality accommodation but service not so good,"Room was good with all mod cons you would expect for this price (>200 euros / night).  Check-in and check-out efficient.  Bar service was poor and no atmosphere with loud music.  Restaurant service was good but food could be healthier.  Overall nothing special and a bit pricey, but it is an airport hotel and therefore convenient for early or late flights.",3,2019,07,06
245,"Clean, Quiet yet Fun","An excellent lace to,spend your first or last nights in Ireland.  All of the Irish charm in a pretty up-scale hotel.

245,Family stay for 1 night,"very pleased with room and dinner when we arrived.  Bed was very comfortable and we had a good sleep before taking an early morning flight. Kids and I enjoyed very much the dinner at the hotel.  Location is perfect, beside the airport is ideal. Coffee and snacks in the reception area before leaving early was a very nice touch and very much appreciated.  ",4,2019,07,03
245,Good hotel but internet poor,"Stayed here on business.  Found the hotel to be fine if on the expensive side.

Dinner and breakfast both good and room clean and tidy and good space both for staying and desk space for business.

Staff friendly and helpful.

My only issue was the internet which was dreadful.  I had to do a US conference Webex/Skype meeting and was far too slow in the end used 4g mobile phone.  In the morning it as worse still could not even get a mobile signal.  This was a significant issue to me and had to go into Dublin to another office as neded connection.

Whilst the hotel was fine this issue would cause me not to use this hotel again until reassured this issue fixed.  Hence why ranked as average for business use.",3,2019,07,03
245,Appalling Service,"We arrived at this hotel at 1am yesterday, via a 4 hour delay. Little effort was made to offer us a decent deal despite a request. The front desk staff offered us a Double Room at $197 with no breakfast. This staff member did not ask if we where Radisson members, so obviously he was not concerned with getting a booking out of us.

We went to another 4* hotel locally, with superior amenities and received a free upgrade, and complementary breakfast for €149.

This hotel lost our money and business. With many darkened rooms, I seriously doubt they can afford to be treating prospective customers in this way.

The female colleague did little to help either.",2,2019,07,03
245,Needs Improvement,This was one of the most disappointing hotel experiences we have had in some time.  The hotel needs to improve in almost every facet.  The customer service was poor.  We had to call down to reception multiple times to beg people to respond to request for help (making local calls and fixing our TV).  The room was not clean - there were hair balls on the floor.  We happened to see an old vacuum cleaner being used by staff in the hallway and it clearly wasn't doing the job.  Information wasn't readily provided.  The restaurant and bar were ok but not to a Radission Blu standard.  The furniture was dated.,2,2019,07,02
245,Disappointed,"Booked a junior suite, and as a rewards member you can expect an upgrade, and even though availability showing on the Radisson rewards web site, I was told no availability. When queried it is because I am staying two nights and the available rooms may be sold. So if you are staying two nights it seems that you are unlikely to get an upgrade. When I went to leave the room, and put my valuables in the safe, there wasn't one. So phoned down to reception again and a safe was brought to my room and I was told it would be secured in the morning! Finally moved to a refurbished room three hours after check in, and at least there was complimentary water in this room. Make sure you request a refurbished room.",3,2019,07,02
245,A Great Place to Prepare for Travel,"Let me first give a heads up for visitors from the U.S. I have found that a LOT of folks want the chrome, shiny lights, and the glitz of U.S. hotels while travelling in Europe. Sorry, this is not a shiny chrome glass hotel. This is Europe! Look at the photos of this hotel and it says it all. Although this IS a Radisson, it is not shiny.

Okay - - we always book a hotel the first day before we travel from Europe to DFW, or from DFW to Europe. We find that the stress of travel and wanting to be sure that we minimize our risks of unforeseen events makes sense to stay at a hotel near the airport. We booked this hotel for our return flight to DFW the day before our travel.

I found this hotel to meet every expectation that we would have for a premium hotel like Radisson. We were GREETED (yes, actually greeted at the reception desk) by Andrea. She was extremely helpful. She checked us in, and suggested the hotel cafe for a very late lunch. We enjoyed a wonderful BLT and my wife had fish soup. Both were fresh and the waiters were friendly and jovial. There is nothing like a pot of tea and a few jokes to solve the problems of travel.

Our room was on the 2nd floor and was quiet. Being as it was summer, the sun never sets. At 2 A.M., it is STILL bright outside. The windows DO have a heavy window curtain that helps make the room dark. We had a KING SIZED BED. Yes!! The bed was firm and the sheets clean. The work area had a desk and computer outlets for work, and there is free wi-fi with great speed. We could not find anything wrong with our room. Kudos!

About the meals - - do not expect a large American style menu with lots and lots of food options. The menu at the hotel is diverse and FRESH. Instead of perhaps 8 different types of steak, they may have 3 or 4. The hotel has FRESH Irish beef and the burgers are enormous! Don't say that I didn't warn ye. I ordered the SMALLEST burger and could not finish it. My wife had a salad and she said that it was delicious. 

Breakfast is a buffet. Again, everything is fresh and I could not find anything to complain about. The food was served warm to hot and the service for the hot tea was prompt. Great breakfast.

Although we did not sample the fare, the hotel pub is very very good. I always check out two items to evaluate a pub: whiskey and beers. This pub had a wonderful selection of Irish and Scotch whiskeys, and a good selection of beer. It also has a warm feel about it. For those seeking a beverage to unwind, THIS is the place.

A few extras: this hotel is walking distance to Terminal 2. I mean you can SEE the Terminal! If you really must drive, a shuttle takes one minute - - yes ONE minute - - to Terminal 2, and the shuttle runs every 15 minutes 24 hours a day (so the sign says). Our shuttle driver was funny and very helpful.

Another extra: the Radisson Blu is walking distance from the car returns at Dublin Airport. We dropped our luggage off at the Radisson and checked into our room, and then returned the car. Afterwards, we had a leisurely stroll of maybe a mile or less to the hotel. This is just soooooo convenient for those staying the night before the return to the U.S.

Another hidden gem - - there are buses and taxis that can take you to Dublin and the City Centre. I believe that a return ticket on the ""fast bus"" is about 24 euros, or you can get a cab. Since Terminal 2 is so close, you can easily get in and out of the City if you want one last visit.",5,2019,07,01
245,Handy if you need to overnight for a flight.,"Stayed here a couple of times, usually if flying out early in the morning or flight gets into Dublin late. Have always found the rooms to be clean and well maintained. Rooms I have stayed in were a nice size. Staff were always friendly. There is a shuttle bus to the airport but I have always been able to walk to the terminal (about 10 (terminal 2) or 15 (Terminal 1) minutes walk). Breakfast is not always included in the cost of the room and can be a bit pricey when paid at the hotel. I think it is normally offered at a discounted rate when you check in, so if you think you are going to get it, that might be the best time to pay. The Breakfast is good and there is a large rate of food available. There is parking on site and there is normally a stay and park option as well which I have used once.",4,2019,07,01
245,Stay,"Disappointing check in,  mix up of room booked and that received. But the room assigned was very spacious, great view and facilities were excellent,  coffee machine available with plenty of supplies overall.",4,2019,07,01
245,Overnight stay before flight,"Situated near Dublin Airport, County Dublin, with a shuttle bus to the terminal.

Check in was easy and there was a lift to the floors.  Our room had a double aspect, however the bed was at a slight downward angle toward the headboard which made sitting in bed difficult.  The quilt cover was torn and the pillows were flat and not plumped.  

The bathroom layout needed reloading at as the toilet was too close to the bath/shower and did not flush properly.  Also when the adjacent room was using their sink, our sink gurgled.

There was tea making facility in the room but did not have adequate supplies and only 1 saucer with the cups.

Food was good and enjoyable, just the right amount.

Overall the hotel needs some tlc in places but is in a good site for the airport.",3,2019,06,30
245,Improved,"I was pleasantly surprised by the improvements in this hotel compared to a few years ago when I last stayed there.  A major plus is the new evening dining area which is a nice change from the previous bar/restaurant.  I also found the staff on reception to be much more competent and friendly.  But the shuttle bus collection from the airport remains a problem with a number of travellers, including myself,  having to phone the hotel to enquire about its arrival. ",4,2019,06,26
245,Over-priced short stay,"OK short stay at convenient location, but all aspects (room, food, drink) wildly over-priced. Welcome back rip-off Ireland! Would hesitate to stay again. Staff friendly enough, except for surly barman.",2,2019,06,26
245,Sad and tired airport hotel,"the room was very dated and a bit shabby. I was only there one night as I was leaving on an early flight to go to a funeral and I thought staying at a Radisson was good idea. Sadly I was wrong. I had a pizza in the sports bar (loud, drab and pretty untidy) because the restaurant was very busy and noisy. Unfortunately, I woke up at around 3am to be violently sick (the pizza was served on a wooden platter which I know is not great for hygiene). I was only just able to get boarded on my early flight thanks to that awful pizza - not what you expect from a Radisson Blu.",2,2019,06,25
245,Barbara Sweeney stay,"The stay was a lovely relaxing way to start our trip away as we were leaving from the airport the next morning .
The waiting staff in collage were particularly pleasant and helpful and the food was great .
",5,2019,06,23
245,Funeral Trip,"I have stayed in this hotel many times, both alone and with my two sons. This was a sad occasion...for my brothers wife’s passing. I travelled alone from Canada. 
I love staying at this hotel, but this time I was disappointed with the price and confusion over drinks.",5,2019,06,21
245,Front Desk Staff incompetent,"I was planning on staying one night and asked for a lates check out. The front desk gave me a time and by 11:30 the next day they had already cancelled my room keys and asked me why I was still in the room. 
I got food poisoning in the restaurant and had to extend my stay. The front desk cancelled my room keys every morning and made me come down and get new ones.
I cancelled my last night of stay. They now say they have no record of that cancellation and charged me for another night. Now I can’t get them to send me a receipt for that cancelled night.
The rooms are clean but tired. Lamp bases are rusty, walls are severely nicked up, tile in the bathroom is chipped.",2,2019,06,20
245,What a service ,"After long delays of our flight and missing our bus home we were so tired then we saw the  radisson logo near the air port and walk over to the  reception at around 1 am there was a guy call ""jose"" a trainee show how quality is the customers service  in radisson  hotel by providing a nice quiet  clean  suite with coffe matching and a cozy bed..that's  all we remember until  the next day 
Highly recommend to stay great  service  wonderful  staff and great  food ",5,2019,06,18
245,Excellent service and location to the airport,"quality of the room exceptional and had a good night sleep. Matress was not too soft and was just right for my comfort, Friendly service at the reception. Location next to the airport is very good. Courtesy bus was very quick ",5,2019,06,18
245,Very Happy!,"Stayed here just for one night with the girlfriend for our flight in the morning and we were VERY happy! The staff were great and extremely helpful and smiley, thee buffet breakfast was just amazing and so was the late night room service from the very smiley and welcoming nightporter! 
The drinks were a little pricey in the bar but it was nice to get an Orchard Theives on draft! (best way to drink it)
The room was brilliant, lovey and spacious, nice bed and very nice shower too! 

Reading through their guestbook, we found that we could use the local pool, so in the morning before our flight, the girlfriend and I had a morning swim just after breakfast!

All in all, a great experience!",5,2019,06,18
245,Dublin last impression,This is a great place to spend your last night in Ireland. very convenient shuttle to the airport. the hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. Really enjoyed the quiet atmosphere after a busy and hectic week.,4,2019,06,17
245,Very convenient for your trip out of Dublin Airport,"We had this room reserved for our last night on our 28 day trip to Ireland. After being in several B&Bs that had very small rooms, the size of the room was appreciated. The room was appointed well and very comfortable. The bath was luxurious, again in comparison. We enjoyed the comfortable bed and got a good night's sleep for our trip back to the states.
The only connection we had to the restaurant is ordering room service for dessert after we had a nice meal in Howth The Chocolate Cake was dry and ordinary, nothing special.

I would recommend this hotel and would very likely stay here again if we return, but I would work to obtain a more reasonable rate.",4,2019,06,15
245,Close to airport,Clean pleasant place to stay.   Very close to airport with free shuttle free shuttle running 24 hours of day.  Staff was courteous and helpful.   Provided snacks in morning for early departures.   Breakfast provided also ,5,2019,06,15
245,The decline of Radisson Hotels ….,"The experience was awful, not a Hotel more of a Hostel, staff were embarrassed and understaffing meant bars not open. Shuttle bus driver took me to a nearby pub and apologised.

if this is hotel using Radisson name under license the consider removing the name as the current situation is doing your brand little favours. Radisson was my go-to hotel, but very disappointed.",1,2019,06,14
245,Okay for proximity to airport,"This hotels scores for its proximity to Dublin airport however offers little else that is remarkable. The service, food and surroundings are average. I would not be ready to rush bask and stay there again.",2,2019,06,13
245,Room and food,The room was not at all remodeled and needed to be the food was not at all tasty! For the price I paid for the room it was a total rip off! The only thing good was that it was right near the airport and they had a shuttle.,1,2019,06,13
245,Disappointing ,"For a 11pm checkin after a short flight, disappointed that the main bar was shut and the hotel bar had very limited availability on alcohol, was unable to get a coffee except for using tea/coffee facilities in our room, woken at 6am with someone moving bins around outside! ",3,2019,06,10
245,Convenient for airport.,We stayed here overnight as we had a morning flight and we didn’t want to drive very early in the morning from the west of Ireland. The hotel is ideally located close to the airport and rental car return so we drop off the car the night before and have no worries in the morning. ,5,2019,06,10
245,OK for a stop for a airplane,"Arrived and the woman at the front desk seemed extremely irritated that I was there. My husband walked in and even asked me if I did something to make her mad. I think she heard him and was a little better. The room is basic, bare bones. drawers were broken in room. It was quiet. Best part was the extremely nice driver who took us to the airport the next day.",2,2019,06,10
245,Stay at Raddison Blu Dublin,Very happy with my stay and the hotel was sooo convenient to the airport which made things easier for my departure preparations.  I was a little bothered by the breakfast attendants who didn’t seem interested in interacting with the guests or explaining some of the breakfast options,5,2019,06,10
245,Truly Awful- Staff are the only good thing at this hotel,"Let me start by saying the staff at this hotel are amazing, especially given what they have to work with!

On arrival we were informed both the bar and the restaurant were closed, not just for food but drinks too but room service would deliver drinks and food to our room, at an additional cost of course!! And in case you think we were arriving at an odd hour, we checked in at 1500 on a Friday!!

The rooms are tired at best but that’s ok as you don’t expect much from airport hotels! We decided on room service the following morning, as both our kids are austistic and can often have some challenges at a busy breakfast setting. The food was cold, the cups and plates filthy, yes filthy and half the order missing, our two boys were seriously upset! We then decided to have lunch before heading over for our flight, they weren’t serving food in the bar, at 1pm and when we went to pay for our drinks they couldn’t get the till to open!

The only redeeming features about this hotel are the staff and location, everything else is appalling!!!! Stay elsewhere if you can!!

",1,2019,06,09
245,The menus and the opening times are all over the place,"Upon early arrival at Radisson blu we were happy to wait for check in. The bar wasn't open until 4pm
( On a Friday, which I thought was strange but ho hum) we waited happily as we wanted to get some lunch. We were advised to go to the restaurant for a buffet lunch. Great selection but it was a 3 course set menu at 16:50 each. We didn’t want a big dinner at lunch time so just had the soup and had to explain to the nice staff that we didn’t want the rest of the offerings. At 5 we headed to the bar to get some pizza for my little girl. We were handed two menus. So we picked what we wanted from both only to be told oh you can only order from The bar menu and the rest would have to be sat in the restaurant to have. Very confusing. So two of us had bar food and the other two went to the restaurant. We followed along later to find that there was a fab kids menu in the restaurant  that included pizza !! And it was FREE! I know it sounds like we were being awkward but we honestly weren’t. All the bar guy had to do was tell me that we could get a great kids menu in the restaurant. As it happened the restaurant staff were fantastic and made my little girl feel so welcome. Gavin and Nina to name them. They turned around the whole awkward day and sent us off on our way a lot happier than we started.",3,2019,06,07
245,Average hotel airport,"The best thing about this property is that it is right at the airport. Location is perfect for travelers. We stayed one night. The service is functional at best. The room was functional, but many of the pieces of furniture had scuff marks. Looks dated and tired.
The restaurant downstairs was surprisingly good and the service was very welcoming. If a guest does not expect much, but a bed and wifi, then this place will be fine.",3,2019,06,06
245,Very convenient to airport - rooms need refurbished ,"Stayed here and booked a superior room - good sized room, very comfortable bed and clean. 
However the room is need of refurbishment as cupboard door wouldn’t close, furniture was chipped, main room lights didn’t work and several other. For a superior room it certainly didn’t come across that way.
",3,2019,06,03
245,"Very nice people, but hampered by corporate ineptitude","The people we interacted with here were very nice. But the stay wasn’t one I’d want to repeat. The rooms are old and tired. The desk chair in our room had a saggy broken bottom and back. 

Internet is a veritable nightmare, requiring not just a room and name login but a full account creation so you can get spammed for life. Yippee😢",2,2019,06,01
245,5 * Airport Hotel ....,"We booked a suite on the 5th floor.
Very well furnished, clean, big rooms and big bath room. 
The bar was very crowded due to a retirement party, so we had to move to the Restaurant for a bottle of wine which we took later up to our Suite. TV Chanel are little confused. 
The breakfast was very Irish, but fully understand we are in Ireland!!
I ordered soft boil eggs when I met the Chef and they were perfect! 
Coffee was good! Staff very friendly.
The Shuttle took us to the airport with a very friendly driver! 
Highly recommended for a Airport Hotel!",4,2019,05,31
245,“Lost” property,"Stayed here 27th May 2019. Items left in bathroom, underwear “found” but not trousers and a blouse. Likely story. Honestly find this “lost” property explanation a bit laughable/unbelievable. I had left a review of this hotel with the hotel, saying it was quite good just needs a lot of upgrading. 3 star not a 4 star.",1,2019,05,30
245,Disappointed from bartlemy co cork,"1 star low budget accommodation at 4 star prices simply not worth it ! Filthy brown corridors with low lighting, Dingy . On our arrival at reception staff seemed uninterested looking past us most of the time whispering to other staff.",1,2019,05,29
245,Great location good hotel,Had a Dublin connection. Arriving 01.00 and leaving 11.30. This is a few minutes walk from T2. I had couple of well needed beers on arrival. Room very comfortable. Good night´s sleep. Staff helpful. Would stay again. ,4,2019,05,29
245,Bad service,"  My wife and myself  booked 2 nights for a  room-suite  on the 5th floor after a 16 day-journey in 
  Ireland.  It was our 6th  stay in this hotel. The living room an the small toilet doors were closed  with keys by arrival.  We had no safe in the room.  The room-keys did not function twice.  The suite was not cleaned the 2nd day by 4pm. /  The new Restaurant is super with friendly staff.",3,2019,05,29
245,Avoid the restaurant ! Seems the chef never worked in a kitchen...,Hotel convenient due to his location next to the airport.I’m staying here every month to take an earlier flight.However avoid the restaurant because the guy in the kitchen don’t know his basics such as Tomato Mozzarella or Caesar Salad ...,2,2019,05,28
245,Great stay,"Stayed here before an early flight. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. We had lunch in the bar and dinner in the restaurant both of which were excellent with good service. Staff at reception were friendly and helpful. The minibus to the airport really useful too. Recommended ",4,2019,05,28
245,Don’t stay here.,DISGUSTING!!! The toilet smelled like the most terrible sewer!  The sheets were stained. The carpet on the way to your room are NASTY. Got woke up by the trash dump right outside our window! NOPE! Gross! The sink stank too!,1,2019,05,28
245,Disappointing.,"We have stayed many times in the Radisson, before early flights and after late flights.

We checked in on 18 Th Apri at approximately 02.00 am, tired as flight delayed leaving Spain.
We rang on arrival at airport for use of shuttle bus, and we were instructed where Togo and wait, in a very strong, authorarative Eastern European accent! I didn’t grasp the full content of the instructions so I rang again to be told that I should have done what I was told the first time! And I’m 63 yrs old!!

Anyway we checked in with our “instructor “ and it was a cold reception, no greeting, no warmth, and no welcome!
I’m not racist, as I’ve many friends who are non national, and love their company. But be aware if like me you expect professionalism, and courtesy, don’t expect it at the Radisson on an early morning check in, when you need it most.
 
Breakfast the next morning , well , if you’re happy to sit and wait, and wait, and wait, or get up and ask, and enquire, and find your cutlery, and find there is no almond milk available, this is the place to eat.....

As I said I’ve stayed here many times, and no problems!
Management need to note, train your staff at reception, and in dining room please, as your prices for stays are over the odds for the poor , poor , service.",1,2019,05,25
245,Disappointing stay,"Outside of the building dirty. Reception area sparse. Staff welcoming and professional. rooms small, in need of updating. Bathroom had copious amounts of caulking sealing areas around the toilet, tub and sink. Black mold in the tub tile. No face clothes. Exposed heating unit too close to the bed. When asking about upgrading, I was told it would not make a difference to the room size, amenities, or quality of the furniture. We stayed only one night awaiting our flight. If I had needed longer I would have left and got another hotel. I have been in this business a long time. The Dublin Radisson Blu is not the Radisson quality I have come to depend on in my travels.",3,2019,05,23
245,Disappointed 😢 ,"Hotel convenient if you are looking for an overnight close to airport only - where you can add parking to your stay.  Other than this I agree with previous reviewer when he said it’s on par with a travel lodge - we were in the non renovated rooms however the premium price of hotel does not lead you to expect this.  I note on previous reviews management recommend booking a renovated room however at a further increased cost!!!!!
Breakfast for two people €35 - and no it wasn’t served on gold plated plates.

We did have an evening meal in hotel restaurant food was good and our server Megan was pleasant and efficient and the cost wasn’t too much more than breakfast!!!!!

Had a return stay booked but have decided to cancel as definitely better choices available.  

Overall very overpriced average hotel 

",3,2019,05,20
245,Nice start to our honeymoon,"We stayed here the night before flying out on honeymoon. When the staff new that we had just gotten married, they gave us drinks & dessert vouchers for the restaurant. The room was comfortable and spacious. There was tea, coffee and snacks available in the reception area at 3am, which was fantastic as we were too early for breakfast. The shuttle bus is very regular, ideal for early flights. Would stay again if flying out early.",5,2019,05,20
245,Perfect for an airport stopover,Lovely clean and well equipped room. We had a really nice meal in the restaurant with pleasant helpful staff. It added to our holiday experience. The reception staff were happy to help me with WiFi when my tablet was having difficulties. We'd stay there again.,5,2019,05,20
245,Wonderful  ,"Just returned home from 3 nights at The Radisson Blu. Lovely Hotel, superb staff and amazing food. Room was comfortable but a little dated. I believe they are in the process of updating rooms, however the bed was superb and we had a great nights sleep. We will return again. ",5,2019,05,19
245,Not best hotel,"Hotel definitely at stage for renovation. It stack in end of 20 century, when quarter of 21st almost finished.
Old rooms with trousers press, no smart electronics, absence of minibar and very generic food for breakfast and lunch, which explained as fabulous in hotel advertising. May be they just don’t know how fabulous could be...",3,2019,05,17
245,Not what I would expect from a premium hotel of this level.,"My wife and I were attending a concert via our holiday. We thought we would treat ourselves and stay at this hotel. On our arrival our first impressions were good as the reception area is quite palcial. Our room on the other hand wasn't. To be perfectly honest it was a posh travelodge room minus the kitkats. The room smelt musty, the toilet syston was broken which meant the sound of running water into the toilet was like Chinese water torture especially when we had been traveling from 4 am. The bathroom was dirty some kind of brown crystallised substance was caked on the grout around the shower tray. We feel that for the price we payed for the room was way too much for what they provided. On a whole this hotel didnt meet our expectations as a premium brand hotel.",1,2019,05,16
245,Poor value of the Money,"Attractive hotel with close proximity to Dublin airport.  Very pricey and disappointing.  We enjoyed an oversized room.  But the bathroom trash can had not been emptied from the last occupant.  We were given 2 half rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom.  One tiny bar of soap 1/4 inch by 3 inches, which was to serve both the sink and shower for two people.  The two bottles of water were for ""Club"" members only.  No make-up mirror or robe.  All this for $309 US",2,2019,05,16
245,Location to the airport,"We stayed at this hotel the night before a flight. It is a 5-10 minute walk from Terminal 2 (we walked to the hotel in the evening from Terminal 2 and used the shuttle in the morning -- a 5 minute ride to Terminal 2). Check-in was easy -- although we had a 15 minute wait in a long line of customers! We had a room on the 2nd floor that has not been renovated. It was near the elevator and facing the back of the hotel looking directly onto a junky roof of the building, a parking lot, and an unkempt yard. The carpet looked clean. However, the ledge above the bed was dust-covered and the lamps were smudged with fingerprints and dusty. The bed was uncomfortable, the pillows were like flat-pancakes. The covers and pillows had a distinct smoke smell (the room smelled vaguely of smoke so we opened the windows to air the room). The bathroom was clean. The bathtub had several chips in the enamel and the tub was really slippery whilst using the shower. The hand-rail on the wall above the tub was loose.
We met friends in the bar-lounge for a light supper around 8:30pm. The service was disorganized and the hot food we ordered was  delivered to us cold (the ""melted"" cheese on the nachos had solidified). When the music was started, we left because we could no longer have a conversation without yelling at one another.
One of us stayed at this hotel in March 2019 in a renovated room that was entirely different from the room we just had. Would I recommend staying here? It depends. If I could be guaranteed a newly renovated room, I would stay. It was an expensive hotel for what we experienced.",3,2019,05,14
245,Location to airport,Perfect location to the airport.  You can walk or take the free shuttle to the airport. Nice and quiet.  Clean comfortable room.  Breakfast had a good selection.  Dinner was good too!  Would recommend this if you are in transit.,4,2019,05,14
245,Great place to stay before heading out of the city,"October 2018 was our second stay at Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport.  Both times we have taken advantage of eating in the restaurant and having the shuttle take us to the airport in the morning so we can depart for the USA.  The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are very clean, the staff members are quite helpful and the food in the restaurant is delicious and not over-priced as can be the case in some hotels.  We will stay there each time we prepare to depart the country at the end of our visits to Ireland.",5,2019,05,13
245,Excellent place - excellent service,"""we let you check in if your room is ready, even if you are early"". That's how good the service is. No hassle, straight forward. Radisson Blu was not in my radar all that much , but now, if it's Dublin airport, I Lt is Radisson for me. ",5,2019,05,12
245,EUR179 for a small double sized pull-down bed,"No TV in room, only furniture was a table with two chairs.
Bed was a pull down / Murphy bed style. Small too.
Bathroom had broken fittings.

Immediately went to complain at reception.
Staff member was disinterested and said I'll move you.
Next room was marginally better in that it had a proper bed and had a TV, but bathroom was in poor state of repair, furniture was badly worn.
For such an expensive price I was shocked.

Will definitely not stay at this hotel again.
",1,2019,05,12
245,Convenient hotel for airport ,"Nice hotel, ten minutes walk or a courtesy bus runs to & from the airport. Nice bar and restaurant. Bit of noise but it is in an airport so to be expected.

Rooms seem to be small but refurbished, no bath but a decent shower.

Probably a bit on the high side price wise but worth it for the convenience.

245,Overnight for an early flight,"This hotel is right at the airport, it is a short walk to Terminal 2. It is above average for airport hotels, with good sized rooms and a  nice lobby area, where you can check in.
The restaurant is nice with a good menu. The waitress, Nina, was great. She was friendly and helpful.",4,2019,05,09
245,Convenient for flyers,"The hotel is very close to Dublin Airport, major car hire companies and gas stands.  It is suitable if your stay is short and quick and does not need luxury.  Breakfast is very good for early morning flyers.  ",5,2019,05,08
245,Ordinary,"This hotel is close to the airport & offers free shuttle service.
The rooms are ordinary but comfortable. They have a restaurant on site but other food options are not convenient to the location. The bar was supposed to open at 1 p.m, but not so. We checked back at 5 p.m & it was still closed. Overall a disappointment.",3,2019,05,08
245,Business trip,Radisson in generally is a clean and well maintained hotel. Ideal for quick business trips. The Collage restaurant... meals can be hit and miss. Burger dinner is excellent with the roast chicken dinner a big disappointment. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There were no shower caps provided in the bathroom. Bedroom was a good size and most importantly the bed was very comfortable. ,4,2019,05,07
245,Fabulous Collage Restaurant wonderful staff,"Myself and my wife just had a fabulous meal in the Collage Restaurant in the Radisson Blu airport hotel. The food was just delicious! The staff we're wonderful especially Nina who was very knowledgeable, polite, friendly and made us feel very welcome. I would recommend this restaurant as we will definitely be back again.",5,2019,05,07
245,Overnight stay.,"The suite was amazing, very comfortable and huge bed.  You sink into the pillows.
Only downside was costs of drinks at the bar, very expensive even for a hotel.  Apart from that would recommend as very convenient to airport.",5,2019,05,07
245,Expensive but close to the airport,"Dublin is expensive and this hotel is equally expensive If you are transiting through Dublin it it a good hotel to stay at as it has a shuttle to and from the hotel. Don't get a taxi into Dublin to save a few euros on the hotel - it is 25 Euros each way! The traffic also seems to be heavy a lot of the time into Dublin so factor this in as well if you need to get to a flight on time.

The hotel as I said is well situated at the airport and is modern in Decor. My bed was super comfy and the room was modern and clean.

There was no vegan food on the menu other than chips/fries and the room service team seemed confused by what vegan was. Luckily i was able to adapt a salad by removing cheese and had a nice meal. The menu didn't list allergens and only accounted for Gluten free and Vegetarian. Not a good thing in a hotel of this standard.

Breakfast was severely limited for a vegan -  some fruit salad. There was some soy milk, but the cereals were decanted so there was no way of knowing whether they had lactose in. I wish free-from bread was available with free-from ""butter"" and some tomatoes and avacadoes etc.

I know I can ask staff, but to be honest staff don't really know the answers and you waste a lot of time to-ing and fro-ing at a time in the morning when you don't really feel like it.

So i cannot recommend this hotel to #vegan travellers as it in #notveganfriendly

other than that a comfortable well sited modern hotel.",4,2019,05,07
245,"Had some issues, but management took care of it.","I loved the location of the hotel. It was walking distance to both terminals. We ended up walking to the airport to take the bus and it was very convenient. Our beds were not separated when we got there, but that issue was fixed. They are doing renovations, so I'm sure the hotel will be nicer. I ate at the restaurant a couple of times and it was good. They have a shuttle that goes to the airport so we took advantage of that when we flew out.",4,2019,05,06
245,hotel definitely needs renovation,"Hotel is good located, shuttle to the airport works perfectly. Staff is very friendly and polite. Hotel undergoes renovation, on the first night we had ugly room with some odd paintings on the wall. Furniture probably from late 70-ties of XX century. Desperately needs renovation. IOn the second night room was better. ",3,2019,05,06
245,Poor quality room - Disappointing,The quality of the standard room doesn’t match the images online. Very disappointed with the accommodation standard at Radisson Blu. After staying in Radisson Blu hotels previously I was extremely surprised.,1,2019,05,02
245,"poor dont bother , better available","2nd time I have stayed , 1st wasn't that great , this time just as poor . Keycard didn't work on 5 different occasions over a 2 day period , i got fed up of working back and forth to reception .
room not warm enough . 
staff could be more polite and friendly ",2,2019,05,02
245,Very convenient for the Airport,"Big hotel just 5 minutes walk from Terminal 2, Staff were good, quick and clear with details, rooms are quite large especially the superior rooms which are well equipped including a good working desk and dressing room plus settee. Room is very comfortable and clean, rooms near the road are quite until around 5am but then there is a lot of road noise. Food (breakfast) is good.",4,2019,05,01
245,Dis-satisified customer review,"It is very disappointing you reply to my query concerning airport car park stating there will be no extra cost and then charging me despite being shown this pledge.   I also noted your kitchen would leave food in the bar, the barstaff could ignore this food for 10 mins before bringing it to customers.   This is why I decided not to have barfood.",1,2019,04,29
245,Poor choice for Dublin Airport,"Location is very convenient, hotel is very poor overall. Rooms need complete refurbishment and staff need to be reset. We booked two adjoining rooms, toilet wouldn’t flush in one. The other has a cracked bathroom sink and the marble desktop had huge crack in the middle. Poor experience overall, would not recommend. ",1,2019,04,28
245,Raving about Radisson,Recently stayed at Radisson Airport Hotel Dublin and was very I.pressed with the friendliness and professionalism of all staff. The hotel was very clean and the bedroom second to none in my opinion. The restaurant food was very good and I would have no hesitation in staying there ag again.,5,2019,04,27
245,Room smelled like cold smoke,Stayed at hotel from 5am until 1pm due to a long layover. It is very conveniently located at the airport. The room smelled distinctly like someone had smoked in there. When we let the receptionist know he essentially shrugged his shoulders. It was 5am after a transatlantic flight so we just stayed but it triggered my husbands allergies. I brought it up at checkout again and receptionists told me they were surprised. No apologies and I paid the full night charge. ,3,2019,04,27
245,Best nights sleep EVER...,"Amazing nights sleep at this hotel,mattress ,pillows and duvets the best we ever experienced.Lovely clean room and fantastic shower facilities.Spacious room and fast efficient check in /check out.Shuttle bus every 15 minutes to and from Airport.",5,2019,04,26
245,Excellent location and great staff,"Stayed here before an early flight from airport. Only had hand luggage so it’s just a very short walk from terminal, so while they offered transportation we decided to walk.

The lady who checked us in was extremely friendly and helpful and gave us an excellent impression of hotel. The rooms are currently being refurbished and we were luckily enough to get a lovely, well decorated and extremely comfortable room.

Excellent value and look forward to staying here again. ",5,2019,04,24
245,No transfer to airport,"Only one of two buses at front was used to bring people to airport at morning rush hour. As a result had to wait 35 minutes  due to overcrowding or had to walk - saw families with children walking. Explained to us hotel is like this all the time, trying to save money. Reception said they would call a taxi - never did, expect they did not call. Appalling experience",1,2019,04,24
245,Terrible bed,Stayed here on our final night as we had an early flight.  There were 3 people so had a pull out couch.  There was no padding in the matress so all you could feel was the bars of the bed and EVERY metal spring.  We called and asked for a second duvet to lay on top of the matress just so the springs didn't dig into you.  I would have honestly slept on the floor instead of that bed it was so uncomfortable.  ,1,2019,04,23
245,"Mixed impressions of Radisson Blu, Dublin Airport","Reasonably good stay at the Radisson hotel before an early morning flight to Crete. However, trainee manager at desk please take note. Do not tell a customer that theirs is a renovated room when it clearly is not. Do not advertise free treats for online booking when these apply only to loyality card holders, even though the sign at the front desk makes no reference to this.",3,2019,04,22
245,Good Location,"We stayed here in a standard room. Room was functional and clean. The staff are friendly and helpful. Collage is a fab place to eat though a bit pricey. We had breakfast and dinner. And the cheesecake was amazing as was all the other food. Ricardo, Dean and Naushika are very helpful and efficient and so was the Reception staff. The Shuttle service to and from the airport is an excellent idea and really makes a difference. And the team of drivers are very helpful and gave us tips about how to go to the city centre. The WIFI network is not very good in the rooms. But it is good in Collage. The lemon infused water in the Reception lounge was a nice touch on a hot day!",4,2019,04,21
245,Good option to stay at Dublin Airport,"Just down a hill in walking distance from the Terminals, this was a great option to spend a night and have a hearty dinner before catching a flight early the next morning. The only down side was, I could not see a visibly marked spot to cross the street in front of the hotel easily. Next time will wait for a Taxi. Else everything the traveler could possibly need seemed in place!",4,2019,04,21
245,Good food bad room,"Bed was ok
When you need toilet paper the most and find out there are none, then all is bad
Imagine getting a room cleaned and no check for toilet paper
The food in restaurant was good but expensive
Nor raddison again",1,2019,04,21
245,Efficient well-located Dublin airport hotel,Stayed here one night on a business trip.  Close to the terminal - there’s a shuttle but you could walk if necessary.  Decent bar and good restaurant.  I left my laptop charger behind and they sent it on to me - helpful service.  I’d stay there again.,4,2019,04,20
245,Quality stay,Hotel met all our needs and went out the way to be helpful. Well-kept property and a good value for the price. Definitely recommend it. Room was clean and had every requisite we could want. Both breakfast and dinner satisfied. ,5,2019,04,19
245,"Radisson Blu, Dublin Airport, 17-18Apr2019","Large room with a large bath area and towel heater.
Comfortable sitting chair and usable desk area.
Very comfortable bed and very comfortable, firm pillows.
Staff were cordial and helpful.
The lamb and the Portobello mushrooms at the Collage restaurant is recommended.
The hotel is currently under renovation (April, 2019), but all efforts to conceal ongoing work had been made.  It will be even better when work completes",5,2019,04,19
245,Needs Updating,"Its a very convenient hotel if your travelling to Dublin Airport early in the morning, which is why were staying there, but other than that, I could not recommend it.  First impressions, lobby had a very tatty table with beautiful flowers on it, staff were lovely checking in.  Walking to our room, the hallway in need of some TLC and updating, carpets were not hoovered and were dirty.  Room was outdated and unpleasant, luckily we didn't have to spend much time in it.  Bed was comfortable, but the room was cold,  Bathroom was ok.  Best part of the stay was trip to the restaurant, very nice decor and relaxing food was ok.  Staff were friendly.  Whats letting this hotel down is its appearance, some money needed to be spent to bring it up to date. ",1,2019,04,19
245,Left me Cold!,"I stayed here prior to an early morning flight. It’s not the cheapest option around the airport but I had stayed a couple of years ago and remembered it as satisfactory. The location of the hotel is excellent too for ease of access to the airport terminals.  First impressions were good: reception staff were friendly and efficient. I thought it was cold but put that down to being the reception area. So far so OK. That however was as far as it went. I had a platinum room which seems to have been recently refurbished. Well, it was small with a small double bed and boy, was it cold! Not helped by the fact that floors are now laminate - no carpeting, just one rug but that’’s under a table. Nothing to keep your tootsies warm  getting out of bed. Probably makes cleaning easier, but who’s that about? - not the customer!! The bathroom was adequate with good dual-headed shower, toiletries, but no shower cap to keep a girl’s hair dry. There’s a pizza menu in the bar but when I heard someone complaining about theirs I headed for the restaurant - where I waited and waited and waited to be seated. No-one seemed to be managing the restaurant and, whilst some of the staff were pleasant and personable, the efficiency of service was poor. Overall, this hotel is extremely disappointing with some features I’d associate with the cheaper chain hotels. Think I’ll be choosing one of the alternatives next time I need to stay at the airport.The hotel was cold, and it left me cold!",3,2019,04,17
245,Oe night stays,"Comfortable, reasonably sized rooms with tea making facilities and very handy for the airport. Clean rooms, friendly staff, good food and drink. Will definitely stay there again when travelling to and from Dublin.",4,2019,04,17
245,This is not up to Much !,"I have never stayed in this Hotel before , however being a Platinum Member I thought I would try same - big mistake - I checked in - not a mention of status the young guy was only interested in getting my credit card - the hotel is under a refurb - and boy does it need it - the place is cold - the Bar full of staff who don t know how to even pull a pint and the sandwich I ordered took for ever ! My room was cold basic and miserable - in short I will sleep in the place , and get out after B/Fast - Happy Happy Days - to be avoided !!",2,2019,04,15
245,Dependable & High Quality,"Nice rooms, very comfortable beds, excellent restaurant, where the staff are just brilliant. Really convenient for the airport - unlike some other 'airport' hotels which in fact are miles away from the airport.",5,2019,04,15
245,Fantastic,"Brilliant service and ensuring that customer is satisfied. Our initial room while satisfactory was a little short on view but we were moved up to a higher floor without fuss.
Always a pleasure to stay here as it combines business and pleasure perfectly.",5,2019,04,14
245,Location to airport.,"No view to speak off and nothing luxurious, however, the hotel is conveniently close to the airport prior to our outbound flight.
I might be a little judgmental here, as I am used to the Radisson Blue hotels in the UAE.",3,2019,04,14
245,Weekend Away,"A lovely modern hotel in a great location, easy access to the city and back by bus.  Great food, both in the restaurant and bar, friendly professional staff.  
Was lucky enough to have a Premium bedroom on the top floor which was very quiet.
We would definitely recommend the Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport!
",4,2019,04,13
245,Great for hitting an early flight,"Great for what I needed, which was a clean, modern hotel near to the airport.
The room was large, and comfortable, had a great bathroom and amenities. Good coffee in the room, and a shuttle that went the few hundred yards to the terminal.
I had the choice between staying in Belfast and an early car, or getting here late and maximizing sleep - and it was easy to do the latter.
Staff were efficient, hotel was comfortable and quiet, and a stone's throw from the airport.",4,2019,04,12
245,Staff totally not interested,"I moved rooms 3 times and yet got not engagement from the staff & no customer service .
After booking 3 rooms & a meeting room there was construction noise so I had to move , second room had no heating system so they moved my bags & the heater they provided but did not switch it on . So I am still in a cold room. They had promised to turn on the heat but they didn’t - The staff had no concern or interest in my stay - worst hotel experience",1,2019,04,08
245,Great location for early flight,The Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport is a great location if you have an early flight. The hotel provides a shuttle service to the terminal every fifteen minutes. The hotel is currently being renovated so understandably there is quite a lot of noise at the present time. ,3,2019,04,06
245,Typical airport hotel,"OK, airport hotels are generally not the most enchanting places and this hotel matches that expectation. Room is spacious, but i had a view of the parking lot. The walls seems to have the same structure as these Japanese walls made of paper. I could nearly participate in the conversation in the room next to mine.
Dinner reminded me of the cafetaria of my college years.
It is very conveniently located and they provide a free shuttle service to the terminals, so it absolutely the right place to stay if your flight is very early in the morning, but otherwise I would advice to spend a bit more time and stay in the centre of Dublin",3,2019,04,05
245,Front desk attendants not informed!,"Radisson Blu health club is a shuttle ride from the property. Radisson Blu personnel were unaware a) the whirlpool, sauna, steam room are co-ed, b) the health club does not provide towels.

Return shuttle from health club back to Radisson Blu, upon discovery that facilities were not accessible, requires call #1, wait, call #2,  Plan on one hour for return. 

Radisson Blu lobby is under construction.",2,2019,04,05
245,Bed from hell,"Extremely poor. My husband stayed in room 143. At 4am he had to change rooms because the bed was so poor. There was a thin mattress with a screw holding the wooden bedframe together directly underneath his spine. It was that bad he had to have a hot bath to be able to walk to reception. The hotel is supposed to be a four star yet has a bed that wouldn't even be in a unclassified hotel. We are going to make a formal complaint to the Radisson hotel group, to the Ombusman and to Failte Ireland. This hotel has fallen extremely short of it's reponsbilities. Photos please note the sixth wooden slat that is crossed over, that piece has a screw in place that was digging into the thin mattress and caused damage to my husband's spine. Look how thin the mattress is that is not four star quality.",1,2019,04,02
245,Business trip,"Stayed recently on a business trip for one night. Room was quite large with en suite and to be honest very comfortable.

Don't normally like hotel food but five of us ate in the restaurant. I shared starters and we had chicken wings and calamari. Both starters were lovely and we commented on how good they were. I had a medium rare rib eye with fries and a peppercorn sauce. It was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. 

Great meal.",5,2019,03,31
245,No exercise room,"I can't remember ever being in a hotel of any size or cost that didn't have at least a basic exercise room. Apparently they will put you on a bus to get to one somewhere? Does it make any sense to put me on a bus to smell it up and get chilled on the way back? Or build in the time to wait for it going both directions? Luxury hotel? Not without such a simple, basic omission. I won't be back.",1,2019,03,29
245,Wonderful airport hotel,"The Radisson Blu is a lovely hotel, located at Dublin Airport. Courtesy coach every 15 minutes. I stayed in a business room. It was very comfortable with a nice view over terminal 2 .All amenities in the room. As I do not have breakfast, I cannot comment on the breakfast. I will definitely stay here again . Room was clean, bed very comfortable. Check-in was professional and fast. No complaints whatsoever.",5,2019,03,27
245,"Lovely, Comfy & Clean","As a last minute booking, my husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for the C2C.
I can't complain about anything other than the breakfast was very cold. 
There were plates in the warmer, but there were too many that the plates on top were still cold. The food in the restaurant every evening was superb, beds comfy, room clean, service and staff were very attentive. 

",4,2019,03,22
245,Bathroom filled with hairs but please check your bill,"I've stayed here three times and the first two stays were good and very good but my last stay was unpleasant and I'm in a dispute with the hotel for an overcharge - which they admit but they refuse to make a full and proper refund.  I would strongly recommend you check your credit card statement as I was charged an extra GBP 107.14 and the hotel refuses to refund the full amount.

Arriving for my third stay, my expectations were high after the previous stay I was looking forward to three comfortable nights while I worked at the airport.

I was in the floor above from last time but the room was an old, very worn and tired looking room but it was spacious and the bed was comfortable and it was on the quiet side.  But when I entered the bathroom, the wash-hand basin was FULL of black hairs.  It looked like someone had trimmed their beard in the wash hand basin.

The hotel did react and offered me a nicer room but this was on the noisy side and next to the lifts (I always decline rooms close to lifts as they are very noisy) but this room was better than the 'hairy' and unclean room.

(Unclean rooms seem to be a  recurring theme with Radisson as this is the second unclean room I've had at a Radisson in 6-weeks).

Fast forward to me checking out and I had noted a pre-authorisation on my credit card statement (typical as these are removed after a few days) but a week later the pre-authorisation had converted to a form credit card transation and so had my final bill on check out.

The hotel have been woefully unhelpful and unprofessional and after multiple emails and calls I have a partial refund but they refuse to refund the actual amount.

I'm due to return to Dublin soon but after this sorry episode and having to refer that matter to my credit card company to dispute, I'll steer well clear of the Radisson.",2,2019,03,20
245,Excellent Stay,"Had a very brief stay in the Hotel before flying out on a short break, the hotel was excellent as was our room and I would certainly recommend it as its just so handy to their airport.There is a courtesy bus available, but if you’d prefer to walk its only about a seven minute walk from the terminals.",5,2019,03,19
245,"dirty, smelly and not really supportive staff - but close to the airport","The Radisson Blu is less than 10 mins to walk from both terminals, you can see the hotel from the airport buildings - so the location is really convenient for people with early flights.
Be aware of the following :
We booked a double room with two large beds - which turned out to have one bed and one sofa to be converted into a bed by the hotel staff. Sofa very uncomfortable. So we asked for the double room booked - and go a room with only one bed but large mattress. So again asked the receptionist to change who did not believe our booking as it was probably offered different on the internet than the real situation in the hotel looks like. So we received a third room - which had two beds in one and had to be converted by the staff (after two hours waiting) into two separate beds.
Bathroom : shower not water pressure, toilet leaking water, room not well cleaned.
TV : only British/Irish channels
Window : cant be opened and was probably cleaned half a year ago last time, very poor view
Floor : dirty and smelly
Price : high in comparison to service and comfort
Bus shuttle to airport : ""you dont need a reservation"" - so obviously was full in the morning and we had to walk to the airport
staff : not really helpful, unfriendly, not welcoming at all",2,2019,03,19
245,Awful,"Primarily Eastern European staff that is rude and unhelpful. Saw five of them gossiping in a different language behind the front desk while many people were waiting to check in. 

Hotel is dated and not clean. 

Shuttle driver was nice.",1,2019,03,18
245,Bathrooms badly in need of renovation,"A one night stay for business and frankly I was expecting better.  I chose the Radisson because I have stayed at other Radisson's in Europe and was quite impressed.  But the Dublin Airport Radisson is badly in need of renovation.  The bathroom fixtures in particular feel like they are original to the building (I'm guessing 1970's).  Rest of the room was just okay... I'm personally not a fan of hanging closets with no doors.  TV was small-ish compared to current norms.  On the positives the shuttle bus was waiting outside the airport terminal and drove me to the hotel immediately... but like the bathrooms, they need new shuttle bus -- it felt very worn down.  All in all, not up to standards that I expect of the Radisson brand.",2,2019,03,18
245,HORRIBLE ,"Horrible stay ! Shuttle driver from the airport had NO clue how it drive ! Hit and drove up on the curb upon our arrival , was rude and not at all helpful. Room 204 was dirty , shower did not work properly , chain on the door did not latch. The pull out bed had an OLD dirty mattress that was so thin all you could feel were springs. Complained and was told hotel was sold out  and then after getting a manager my husband was shown another room that they indicated a better type of pullout bed could be brought too . Upon the employees inspection of the room he realized a bed would not fit , left my husband and told him he would be right back - 20 minutes later my husband had to go to the front desk to find him !! By now it’s after midnight and we have an early
flight so they gave us another room and we had to split up . For 265 Euros I would have expected much better and will not return to any Radisson chains since they obviously do not maintain their facilities. ",1,2019,03,17
245,Near to terminals,"Very typical airport hotel: efficient and some how tasteless. All facilities were allright. Nothing to complain with the room, large bar, fair restaurant, excellent breakfast, shuttlebus in every 15 minutes. Quite expensive: after discount basic room nearly 200 €",4,2019,03,07
245,"Great location, and amenities - 24 hour noise (not the planes)","This was a 1 night stay for business, using the conference facilities which were very good. My room was at the back, just above a service corridor and the bins - what a racket. Every 20-30 minutes, a bin or stillage of rattly empty bottles was wheeled out over a bumpy concrete floor. Eventually at about 2AM I rang reception to complain - and top marks, it stopped, until 6AM. Exactly NOT the preparation you need for a stressful presentation the next day. Even Air Traffic Control had more consideration, as the flights stopped arouns midnight.
I still might ask for a full refund
So, ask for a room at the back to the left of the lifts as your looking at them.
Room service good. Restaurant OK, but run by children.
I will stop there again for the convenience, but choose my room wisely.
NB:If this review has been helpful please thumbs up",2,2019,03,07
245,Beautiful place to stay,"This hotel feels and looks like new, unsure how old it is. It is clean, spacious and friendly. The superior room is well presented and spotless clean. The bed, linen and pillows were extremely comfortable. You can hear the aircraft noise a little ar at night which is understandable as it's about a 5 minute walk. The bar is not stupidly overpriced and there is a wonderful selection of lunch items in the lounge area. Really relaxing place to stay even though it's really busy with business people in the daytime!",5,2019,03,05
245,CHEAP TOWELS ARE NOT GOOD!!,"Great hotel in a very convenient location. Welcoming staff - good food in nice surroundings. Upgrades to rooms in recent past have been a great improvement.

BUT THOSE TOWELS....................

More like what you would expect to find in a youth hostel!

Cheap is not a good idea in a 5 star hotel.
Please go back to what you had.",4,2019,03,04
245,Poor offerings for an airport hotel,"The positive for this hotel is that it is close to the airport. About 5 minutes on a free shuttle bus that runs every 15 mins 24 hours, which is good. However for a hotel which should be geared up for one night stays, the service isn't great. No plug points near the bed which isn't helpful. The food and service in the restaurant was very poor. 35 minutes for a soggy burger and fries. I asked for vinegar and the waitress forgot all about me, twice!",2,2019,02,23
245,Lovely place with friendly staff,"Really enjoyed having a few drinks in the bar, it was a fabulous environment to sit back and relax in. Both staff members at the bar were really nice, we were served by Kelly who was extremely friendly and managed to give us a few laughs also. We had a very pleasant visit.",5,2019,02,20
245,Amazing Staff,"Pleasantly surprised with this hotel, I had a lovely room and the lady who checked me in was very pleasant. Really enjoyed the food in the restaurant, lovely flavours. Nima (not sure I spelt that right) was an amazing, friendly and efficient waitress, brilliant customer service demonstrated by all staff in the restaurant. Will definitely stay again, use to stay in the Clauton but now this hotel will be my number 1 choice. Keep up the good work.",5,2019,02,18
245,Overnighter at the airport,"Finally managed to get to stay at the Radisson at Dublin airport. Used as an overnight stay due to a late arrival. 
Speedy and courteous check in and nice well appointed room. Wifi was great, with good speed.
Chose to eat in the bar, rather limited menu, but what was provided was good quality. Breakfast was also of good quality.
My only real bugbear about this hotel (in common with most airport hotels) is the ridiculous charge for parking. After paying a significant amount to stay at the hotel I rather resent paying an additional parking charge.",4,2019,02,18
245,Ideal When Over Nighting Before a Long Haul Flight,"Quick and efficient check in by friendly staff. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Requested additional towels which arrived promptly.
We dined in the restaurant and the food was cooked to our requirements. Again, excellent service.
Lovely atmosphere in the bar afterwards.
Shuttle bus next morning was on time and one of the nicest drivers I have met in a very long time.",4,2019,02,12
245,One night prior to travel back to Canada.,Stayed one night before a morning flight back to Canada.   This is the closest hotel to the airport - you can walk easily from car rental or airport.  Arrived on a windy squally wet evening and was very welcoming.  Room very nice.  Bar was very good and tender very friendly.  We ate in the restaurant and the food and service were both excellent.  We often stay at the Crowne Plaza - Holiday Inn Express but this experience suggests the Radisson may be a preferred option in the future.,5,2019,02,10
245,Good hotel,Good hotel with large rooms in vicinity of Dublin airport. They have complimentary shuttle to/from Dublin airport which runs almost every 15 minutes. Premium rooms have microwave and premium coffee machines as well.,5,2019,02,09
245,Brilliant Receptionist,"I stayed here on Thursday with my partner and we had a lovely time. Everyone was nice especially a lovely receptionist Agly she was very helpful and very good at her job, she made sure my partner were always happy. our room was very cold and i called 3 times for someone to have a look so i went downstairs to complain and Agly was very helpful she made she i was happy and comfortable by offering me extra duvets and a heater, nothing was too much trouble for her she was the best receptionist on shift, constantly checking up on us to make sure we are happy. she made our stay worth while.",4,2019,02,06
245,Disappointed with rooms ,"I stayed here from 28 January 2019 to 1st February 2019. 

Upon entry to hotel it all looked grand in the lobby and I was looking forward to my week stay as I had several meetings around the airport location. My excitement level dropped the moment I entered my second floor room. It was something out of the 80’s, old wooden furniture, no power sockets on side of the bed, disabled toilets(when I am not disabled). I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry! 

As it was late in the night I slept and went off to work in the morning. Upon my return I went to reception to ask if I could change and they were very nice and understanding and moved me to the 4th floor. Slightly better but not the Radisson standard I am used to.

Breakfast is good and plenty of choices and the staff are very welcoming.

Bar is nice and again great staff and premier league football is available on the screens.

What makes the hotel is the staff and Radisson need to make investment in the rooms. 

If you are a business traveller staying for few days and looking for a bit of class then I don’t think this hotel is for you. The staff even told me none of the rooms have power points on side of the bed. ",3,2019,02,03
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport Hotel," I highly recommend the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport Hotel. It is such a great airport Hotel with outstanding staff! Most important! The rooms have modern furnishings and fittings. I always feel so very comfortable here!",5,2019,01,28
245,Nice hotel ,"I stayed here on the 3rd of January. Arrived late as I had a very long day with work but the check-in was very friendly and efficient. The room was nice but I found the feel of it a bit cold. As expected with Radisson Blu hotels it was very clean and plenty of towels and toiletries. Very comfy bed and slept very well. 

The hotel bar was lovely but I found it quiet, probably due to the time of year. Staff were very friendly and there was a very good selection of drinks. 

Breakfast was very good, huge choice and the hot food was fresh. When it comes to breakfast Radisson Blu hotels really do a great job. 

The reason I will not give a higher rating for this hotel is the fact there is no on site gym. I asked and the staff told me a driver will take me there, it’s a 5min or a 10min walk. For the price I paid for my stay that was a real let down. Very disappointed by this. Not sure if I’ll stay here again to be honest

",4,2019,01,27
245,"Very good hotel for the business trips, conferences and meetings","Very useful shuttle service, friendly accommodation at the reception, spacious rooms, very comfortable bed, good breakfast, spacious lobby very suitable for short meetings and some drinks, cosy bar T3 and good restaurant. ",4,2019,01,27
245,Radisson blu Dublin airport,"The 1st room given to us was not of Radisson standard.It was comparable to a £30 - 50 roomCarbonates, light fittings and plug sockets were all slanted. As if a cowboy builder had pulled a fast one.This issue ruined our 1st impression of the last day of our break/celebration.Staff were greatFood was greatSecond room was good",2,2019,01,26
245,Really poor service re: gym ,"Used this hotel specifically because it’s an airport hotel with gym access. Turns out the gym is a 5 min drive away and, when you want to go back to the hotel, you have to wait over half an hour for the shuttle bus to take you back. At the end of a long day, which started at 4am, and ended with a workout in a second rate gym, a half hour wait was really unacceptable and enough to annoy me pretty severely. 

Speaking to the staff, other customers have had waits of over an hour so, I guess, I’m lucky.  

If you are looking for a hotel with a gym, don’t use this one. ",1,2019,01,24
245,Ok for one night,"We called the hotel after getting off our flight and asked to be picked up in the shuttle bus.  45 minutes later, we decided to walk, crossing busy roads, to get to the hotel. The front desk staff apologized, but there was no explanation given. 

We ate at the restaurant, which is not very appealing, but the food was ok.  Our room was reasonably clean and neat, and the hotel corridors are normal width, unlike the awful narrow hallways in the Maldron.  

It’s time the airport authority negotiated with a decent hotel chain to build a good hotel in the airport of our capital city.  Meanwhile, when getting an early morning flight, we’ll stay further afield and get a taxi to the airport.",3,2019,01,20
245,Stop over stay Dublin Airport,"Best hotel to use if staying at a dublin for connecting flights. I’ve stayed at them all and this is by far the best and friendliest. Excellent and worth the extra money. The pick up service is excellent, the restaurants and bar are great and the staff very helpful and professional. ",4,2019,01,18
245,Amenities need work,"The hotel is fine, it is close to the airport and for the most part is in reasonable shape.  However, the hotel needs to get their act together as it relates to the fitness centre.  I understand they have an arrangement with a nearby facility where they give you a day pass -- no issues with that.  However, getting there was a pain.  Cold January day, so it was not possible to walk.  I was told to wait for a car.  As it turns out the car was the airport shuttle where you are getting in your gym outfit with people heading to the airport.  Then when I asked the shuttle driver about taking me to the gym he said it would be 30 minutes as he focused on the airport shuttle runs.  He told me to ask the front desk to arrange a ride for me (which I originally thought was the deal).  Waiting around in the lobby in the gym clothes while these guys figured it out was not in the cards so I counted my losses at this point.  Besides the gym issue, the bed in my room was on rollers that made sleeping uncomfortable.  When I brought it to their attention, they mentioned that it was temporary as the fourth floor is undergoing renovations.  They said I could have got it changed so maybe my fault for not bringing it to their attention the night before.  Anyway, outside of needing to make an early flight, don't think I will be staying here again.",3,2019,01,18
245,Excellent stay before our long haul flight,"We had an excellent stay at the hotel before traveling on a long haul flight with my 2 small daughters. I stay in the hotel with my daughters, and my parents and the service from start to finish was excellent. The family room we were provided was great, and met all our needs for the night. I would definitely come back again if traveling to/from Dublin",5,2019,01,17
245,Great place to stay before leaving Dublin,Picked this hotel through TripAdvisor.  Was a 5 minutes from the terminal.  Everyone could not have been more friendly.  The room was excellent.  Service was excellent.  Staff Excellent.  Catching the shuttle was brilliant. Really exceptional the whole experience ,5,2019,01,15
245,Relax in comfort away from home,"We liked many things about this hotel,Nice big room , very friendly staff at reception and as first point of  contact most important.   Good food.  Parking close to hotel .  Lively big  reception area.  Conference room very comfortable. ",5,2019,01,14
245,Hotel going down hill,"As a regular visitor to Dublin airport, I have stayed in both of the two nearest hotels quite a few times.
This will be the last time I will stay in the Radisson as the nearby Maldron is now much better in all respects.
I have just checked out of the Radisson and fancied a small snack , Coffee and a sandwich etc only to be told that the coffee dock is only open for a private function and that I was free to use the overpriced restaurant if I wished.
Now for a four star (their rating)to not have basic food available at lunch time is a disgrace.People are arriving all the time and the only thing available is a restaurant where the average main course is over €20.
The management could do with having a good look at their operation, rooms are rundown , basic things like toilets not working properly , bath /showers are lethal with no mats and TVs have only basic free to air channels .Finally when I had arrived at the airport and went to the courtesy bus stop the sign said pickup every 15 mins 24hrs a day.Please phone hotel between 1am and 5am .I had arrived at 12.15am and there was 8 ppl waiting including a young family who had already been waiting 20 minutes.Knowing that the van was small, holding 8 maximum I asked the Maldron bus driver who had arrived if he could oblige and take some guests to the Radisson which he kindly did .On arrival at the hotel I informed the reception staff of this situation and I was told that guests have to actually phone the hotel after 10pm and that the sign was not correct .The Maldron driver had informed me that these queues and long waits were a regular occurence at night and that he has often seen large groups waiting at the shared stop. 
So I know where I will be booking when I next have to stay near Dublin airport...",2,2019,01,13
245,Good Airport location,"Newly renovated room was very good,  restaurant food was excellent. Courtesy bus service was also good.  For early morning flights would pick this hotel again.Staff were friendly and courteous. Would stay here again.",4,2019,01,13
245,Business,The hotel is convenient if you have a early flight. The check in was very easy and the staff were very friendly. I dealt with reservations and they we happy to help with my booking and car park booking. The car is priced very good ,5,2019,01,12
245,Very Disappointed in this Radisson,"This was my third time staying here and I only pick it if the price is right. 
This is how my stay went... Upon check in I had a room with two double beds reserved, which I paid for. Getting to my room, it has one bed and a pull out love seat. When I called the front desk, they said they don't have double bed rooms anymore. When I asked the housekeeper in the hall, it appears they do, so someone lied not to mention they charged me for two double beds, but only provided 1. (that mattress on the love seat is NOT worthy of your worst enemy) Skip eating dinner there, walk around the corner, the food is much better. BREAKFAST on the other hand, is worth the 10.00 paid. This location has 1 thing going for it, its location. Nothing else would make me come back. Also, two bottles of water was supposed to be in the room, when I asked front desk, they said check the mini fridge, when I looked there wasn't a mini fridge... I did eventually get the water, but just another level of confusion amongst the staff.",3,2019,01,11
245,If it’s a last-minute need to be close to the airport then...okay.,"Overall it wasn’t reallly as expected. From the website I excpected a lot more than I received. The shuttle bus and the workers in the restaurant were lovely but it seemed like we bothered the lady working at reception when we checked in. She went over everything very quickly and we didnt catch a lot, my guest ended up looking up breakfast times on the website to make sure we could still eat when we got up at 3:30 to go to the airport for an early morning flight. I even picked up a rewards member card to ask to join but she handed us the room key and turned away so I couldn’t ask. I was slightly disappointed as I wanted to put my purchase to future use, and perhaps have the Raddison Blu as my go to in Dublin Airport when I come to visit for flights very frequently. The lobby’s elevators had a sign saying you needed to use your room card to press the button, but after my 5th time trying I realised anyone could use the button and I looked kind of silly. That was also quite scary considering how close to the airport this hotel is, and also how dead the lobby is the majority of the time. Really anyone could have came upstairs.We went to our room, it was entirely lovely except some of the lights were wired weird and the tv was ancient. But everything else was perfect, especially the bed and bathroom. It was everything you would have wanted in a hotel. Collage Restaurant was an enigma. Entirely overpriced for what you receive and it had a weird layout, however the waitress that tended to us was very very helpful. Overal the sleep was okay but considering me and my guest were going in and out quite frequently because I am a smoker, we needed to go to a store at one point and I was dropping my guest off to a flight, the elevator and lobby situation was just iffy. There was a lot of leads just taped down to the floor, it was particularly dreary and just not what i had pictured when I looked at the pictures on the website. For two meals and a drink it also came to 60.00 EURO, which I thought was very expensive, and to have a small pizza and a water delivered to the room it was 24.00 EURO. We were told there would be grab and go breakfast in the morning which was just water, coffee and a nature valley bar which wasn’t what we had in mind, we ended up eating at the airport. At 4:15 when I left i didn’t grab a water because we were on our way out, when I returned after dropping my guest off for her flight at 5am there was no water left. Worker said “all out”. ",3,2019,01,09
245,"staff very friendly and helpful, renovated rooms excellent, easy airport access.","initially placed in an old dated room on the 4th floor undergoing construction. there were noise and odors (paint and plaster). I was moved to a renovated which were excellent and very nice.  staff were an outstanding quality at this hotel. joanne, Anthony, Silvia, and Paul, in particular,  go out of their way to be helpful. 
the restaurant food was excellent. the location is perfect for the airport. easy access to the city center, shopping at a mall in swords. rates are very high as all hotels in Dublin.",4,2019,01,09
245,Sharveen is the definition of hospitality,"Traveled all day and still had 14 hours left of our 24 hour layover in Dublin. Tried to tough it out but couldn’t. Tried every hotel around the airport but was shut down. Sharveen greeted us with an embrace only family could give. Not only was he a true professional. He is the definition of hospitality! Selfless, kind, and caring. Just by sharveen’s interaction alone, will make me stay at raddisom properties for the rest of my life. Thank you Sharveen, you are the definition of hospitality and a true asset to this company!",5,2019,01,08
245,Overnight Radisson Dublin Airport,"Excellent service at the hotel. Booked a double room for me and my two children - positively surprised by the extra sofa bed made up in the room, plus the kids staying at the hotel under 12 eat free offer. Would definitely recommend ",5,2019,01,07
245,One night stay with family,"Stayed here the night before we flew back from holidays with my family . First impressions were ok and to be honest the hotel served its purpose for a one night stay. Only negative was the lack of a porter service , the staff watched me drag my bags around the place (not that i minded) without even a request for assistance. Positives was the restaurant where breakfast is served the breakfast buffet was great and the food at night there was very nice with great customer service.",3,2019,01,05
245,Not up to Blu standards,"This is a hotel that needs refreshing, felt old and tired.  The toilet did not work, was fixed but then broke again later. The shower was ver erratic, hot/cold. They only place one towel in bathroom, a second is in the clothes closet. Limited food options available when arrived at 14:00.Food in bar area was not good, especially the nachos. ",2,2019,01,05
245,Airport stay.,Not a good hotel to stay at if you rely on a wheelchair as their transport is not accessible to and from the airport. The room was very noisy from other residents. The food and service in the Collage restaurant was very good.,3,2019,01,02
245,Filthy Hotel - Stay Anywhere Else,"On arrival at Dublin airport, no shuttle was operated by the hotel. The information at the bus stop was completely incorrect and the phone number provided had one digit missing. After waiting over 40 minutes for a shuttle to arrive (which is meant to be every 15 minutes), I called the hotel and a shuttle eventually came. At the hotel, I was provided with a room which was outdated and had significant damage (stains and large marks on the furniture) but my main issue was the cleanliness. The toilet had urine stains covering the seat and bowl. It was obvious it had not even been wiped after the other guest had left. I asked reception for another room and was told I would be upgraded. The second room appeared to be newly renovated but it was again clear on entering that even basic cleanliness was lacking. The carpet and wooden flooring looked as if they had not been vacuumed in more than a week with balls of dust having accumulated. Hair from various bodily parts covered the bathroom floor and the cups and spoons for tea/coffee had not been cleaned. For 130 euro a night, a clean room should be a given. I complained the following morning to the management, showing pictures of the dirt but received an apathetic response from the hotel staff. I would not recommend this hotel and would suggest that others stay in one of the other airport hotels, which cannot be worse than this one.",1,2018,12,31
245,Convenient and Comfortable,Stayed at hotel last night to catch an early flight this morning. Very convenient to the airport and the shuttle is great. Just leave enough time to get to terminal in the morning == if there are a lot of hotel guests you may have to wait for a few shuttles. Had dinner at the restaurant in lobby. It was very good and the service was excellent. Very comfortable bed and room was clean. This is our 3rd time and we will be back.,5,2018,12,29
245,"Great staff, ok rooms and location","Stayed here on business and chose this hotel due to it's proximity to work location. My room was a bit dated but clean and the bed was soooooo comfortable (I had a hard time getting out of it for work everyday). The staff was amazing, helpful, and welcoming. The location of the hotel is great if you are only staying one night and flying. Otherwise if you stay a week like I did and plan to venture into Dublin city, then find a hotel closer there. A taxi costs roughly €25 to the city center. The restaurant and room service staff were a 10 out of 10. Food tastes great and service was always quick. The cleaning lady was very sweet and did a very thorough job.",4,2018,12,29
245,Miserable experience,"Stay ruined as one of the few hotels open at Christmas . Except don’t inform you bar closed , restaurant closed at 20.00 but tried to order at 1950 and told we couldn’t . Will go to malaise or portmarnock next time where at least there’s some service",1,2018,12,27
245,"Outdated hotel, friendly staff",Stayed one night for business with rented meeting room. Bedrooms are completely outdated so was the meeting room. Staff is very friendly tough. Breakfast and lunch good value. Make over of rooms and meeting rooms really needed- paud €140 which is expensive given the location/state of location.,3,2018,12,26
245,Emma,Lovely hotel with amazing staff who couldn’t do enough for me. A special mention has to go to the handsome bus driver from Edinburgh. A real bundle of fun. His humour has me in stitches. Can’t wait for my next visit,5,2018,12,21
245,RECENT STAY,"Hotel ok.Convenient for airport but watch out for the shuttle driver. He would not wait for a slow walking passenger and abandoned him (me!) in heavy rain. No option but to walk through the weather to the terminal to ensure catching the flight. Very poor behaviour, and quite spoiling the entire perception of the hotel.  ",3,2018,12,19
245,Best Breakfast / Excellent service ,"Hi have stayed in the hotel a number of times and I have always enjoyed my experience.I recent called in for breakfast and it was excellent , great friendly service the selection of hot and cold buffet is 5 star very impressed by selection of breads also coffee quality excellent.
The best hotel to stay in this area only a short 10 walk to Dublin airport lots of space to park your car if you need it.
Excellent well done looking forward to my next visit.",5,2018,12,15
245,always cool to stay in the Radisson,This time I had a wonderful room - and everything was super - the night porter and chauffeur to the airport in the morning ( also the guy at the bar in the middle of the night) were such friendly people - I felt very good this time in the Radisson. The Staff are great - interior also - service good and cleanness in room also very good. No complaints . ,3,2018,12,12
245,Christmas party,"We had our work Christmas party here so we stayed the night, nice spacious room and excellent food. The staff were very helpful and courteous. The hotel itself is ideally located in Dublin airport for anyone who is flying in or out",4,2018,12,11
245,Excellent Friendly Staff,"Stayed for just the one Saturday night. Room very nice and clean - Breakfast was fantastic - one of the best choices of Breakfast I have had in a long time. Special mention to the staff though - nothing was too much trouble. I was staying with my daughter who was doing a Gymnastic competition and her hair needed platting - Amy on reception patiently platted her hair, whilst Sara gave her bottles of water and some fruit to bring with her. Will definitely return.",5,2018,12,07
245,Just poor,"This has got to the one of the worse rooms I’ve ever stayed in and I’ve stayed in some pits. The bed reminds me of a matchstick box with a mattress as thin as a cardboard, sockets hanging off wall and damage to cupboards. 
The room is so dated it looks like it’s been uncovered but the time team. There is nothing 4 star about this hotel and I’d rather stay in the premier inn next time. ",1,2018,12,07
245,Not Good,"Hmmm! 

➖ Had to pay for parking although didn’t have to last time I stayed. Restaurant food poor quality. Dinner service was chaotic and poorly supervised. No organization. Staff were friendly but need training and supervision and direction. 
Bed was uncomfortable with a dip in the middle of the mattress and a mosh-mash of pillows of varying sizes. Room was dated, bathroom In particular was dull and basic. 
Food and drink expensive as was cost of stay. Not what I would have expected for the €300+ we spent while we were there for 9 hours.

➕ Staff very nice and friendly (mostly)",2,2018,12,04
245,Christmas party,Very clean hotel  The lady on reception area was very pleasant and has a big smile ..Room was lovely was a bit cold dough .Food was lovely breakfast was very nice something for everyone .Only thing that let it down was the bar was one person serving so always a bit of a wait apart from that had a lovely stay ,5,2018,11,26
245,Quality way down,"Hotel reminded me of a poor quality budget hotel.  Main plus is location to airport  and friendliness of van drivers and porters.  Bedrooms are very basic and not at all high quality - bathroom grout is questionable.  Beds are too small.  Fine for one person, but no king size beds??",1,2018,11,23
245,Absolutely abominable,After spending almost €1000 in the hote for a two stay visit I was rudely & highly insulted by the car park attendant who incidentally tried to overcharge me. So much for Dublin hospitality & I am Irish!!,1,2018,11,17
245,Very Poor Radisson Experience,"Undoubtedly, being an airport location, this Radisson gets plenty of business.  However, as Radisson Gold members we found the experience entirely unsatisfactory.  We had booked a particular room type and, but were not allocated such a room and received no satisfaction at reception.  As we were checking out early the next morning for a flight we asked to pay the night before, but were then subjected to a lengthy delay on checkout because parking had been forgotten the night before.  Altogether, we were not happy.",2,2018,11,16
245,Super airport hotel,"Stayed 1 night to attend a conference at the hotel the next day.
He staff are very nice and friendly and the food for an airport hotel is fantastic.
Even although you are on the edge of a busy airport, the rooms are relatively quiet.
The hotel has a feee shuttle bus to and from the airport with runs every 15 minutes from 5am until midnight.",4,2018,11,09
245,Ideal location for the airport,"It has been a number of years since I have used this hotel, having opted for other hotels at the airport,
The pluses are 
- <10 minutes walk to terminal.
Jellys sweets at the reception
Spacious rooms 
Car parking was good value for guests
The minuses are
The bar only served pizza or chicken wings on the evening so we ate at the restaurant
The Burger meat served should never have been bought so it never ended up on a plate, cheap and nasty frozen compressed ""meat"", The fries were excellent, the brioche bun was good and as were the accompaniments. A plea to the purchasing department, either allow the chef to make homemade burgers or buy decent ones.
I will be back soon to this hotel at the airport , but will make a different dinner choice.
Reception Staff were friendly and helpful",4,2018,11,06
245,Must stay,"This hotel is excellent in every way. If you are ever looking for a hotel near the airport in dublin then spend the money and stay here. Food, staff, rooms all first class.

Airport shuttle available, room service and restaurant are both great. ",5,2018,11,06
245,Not the best value but convient,"Hard to get a good sleep with prison style pillows that are probably as old as the hotel itself. The rooms are outdated and the water pressure in the shower was atrocious. Dont depend on the wifi either, you would get better bandwidth over a dialup connection.",3,2018,11,05
245,Average room.Good food ,Stayed there for 15 days due to business trip.The rooms needs refurbishment for sure.Old style rooms and boring decoration but size of the rooms was very good.Nice and comfort bed.Stuff was very friendly and helpful also the food on the restau was very good and tasty.Average Breakfast.All in all for a couple of days is good but not for long term stays.,3,2018,11,04
245,Great Staff,"What an experience. Check in was painless and was quick. The Attendant explained where everything was located, time for breakfast, bar, and I asked about room service and she responded very quickly by telling me to dial 0 for room service. The room was really spacious with Shelves by the door. Even number room are facing the airport and odd are facing the parking lot and road. One of my co-worker was on the airport side and I could not hear the planes landing and I was on the road and parking and I couldn't hear that either. Overall it is extremely clean with very friendly staff. I highly recommend.",5,2018,11,02
245,Anthony in reception is a gem,"Our stay was 1 night, def a little pricey as it is a bit run down and could do with updated in a lot of areas. Our check in with Anthony was professional and warm. He is a shining light in this hotel. It was like we were checking in home. He is an amazing ambassador for the hotel. ",4,2018,10,27
245,Convenient location if you have an early flight,This hotel is great if you have an early flight. The free shuttle from the airport to the hotel was the highlight for me. The shuttle comes every 20 minutes and drives you to the hotel. The superior room was comfortable and spacious. You can use the nearby gym if you want for no additional costs. The breakfast was good but not impressive.,4,2018,10,26
245,Overnight stay before early flight,"I have no complaints about the hotel itself, only that staffing in T3 bar has a lot to be desired. I appreciate that new staff need to learn but to leave 1 young man to help newbies (2 diff during our visit), serve, clear tables, deliver food to tables and handle complaints is a disgrace.  Every time I went to bar I had the misfortune of the young lady who didn't listen to order, walked past you cleaning glasses, started to clean empties on bar midway serving order or my favourite of choosing to eat chicken wings and constantly ignoring customer's food sitting on hot  plate waiting to be delivered to table. Based on our seat we could see that food was sitting for a considerable length of time before being delivered. At the end of the evening I ordered a pizza to take-away with no mushrooms and given what I witnessed I went down to hot plate myself to collect as I saw the chef put it  up. I asked the chef if I was ok to take x pizza without mushrooms and he shouted the young man who said I was only pizza pending, label clearly stated what I ordered.  We got up to the room and to my disbelief it was covered in mushrooms and what really angered me was the fact I had spoken to the chef directly and said he said nothing, he obviously knew it was wrong but choose to say nothing.
Perfect hotel in great location but hotel doesn't appear to care about staffing.",3,2018,10,24
245,"Tired traveller, tired hotel","Don't sleep road side it is very noisy, also there seems to be a ton of building work going on which they didn't mention at anytime.

Tried to set an alarm via room phone couldn't get through at all. Gave up.

The interior of the room has seen better days, is very dated and filthy, stains on the chairs, dust everywhere, very worn out and the furniture is old.

Mostly friendly staff, except the woman checking me out, didn't care to ask about my stay - maybe she could tell i'd had 3 hours sleep.",2,2018,10,23
245,Worn out!,"Good airport location, friendly staff and spacious room. The interior of the room however has seen its better days, is very dated and filthy, stains on the chairs, mold on the bathroom walls, very worn out furniture takes away from a good experience. See for yourself.",2,2018,10,20
245,"It’s OK, but nothing to shout about. ","Handy for an overnight stay for a very early morning flight. Within easy walking distance to the airport, although there is a hotel shuttle bus service. Staff I encountered were very helpful and friendly. Rooms are clean, and of a good size. Plenty of room for your luggage without tripping over it. Signs of wear in bathroom, and furniture, but that’s to be expected. Despite this, rooms are rather basic, and seem over priced. ",3,2018,10,18
245,Good airport hotel,"Stayed here since I had an early flight the next morning. 
The hotel offers free WiFi and has a good restaurant which closes at 22.00. 
I had a good dinner in the restaurant.
The hotel also offers free shuttle service to the airport. ",4,2018,10,18
245,Nicer than the competition ,Stayed twice in 30 day period. Bar & restaurant nice. Felt out of 6 Radissons I stayed in recently this was the only one you could get rewards other than bottled water. Good discount for kids food although 2nd time it never occurred to waiter to ask were we staying so was charged in full. But sorted refund with manager later. (Do people really go for dinner there who are not guests??) Bit of training wouldn’t go amiss. Also when cafe runs out of stuff would be helpful if they could rub it off the board! Regular bedrooms not nice at all but business class one was a great improvement.,4,2018,10,15
245,Refreshing Stay before leaving Ireland.,"This was an easy, refreshing overnight stay.  Our flight left at 6:00 am so we had to leave the hotel at 4:00 am.  Radisson did an excellent job of meeting the needs of these tired travelers.  Interestingly, the people we met at the Bar were Irish locals, also on their way to somewhere, or arriving back home with a drive the next day. There were also a good number of tourists. Bartenders were friendly.  We arrived around 8:30 pm, ordered pizza and wine from a decent selection.  Rooms were beautifully updated, well appointed, and spacious.  Was nice to finally have secure internet so we could remote into our business. At 4:00 am we found American coffee, breakfast bars and more waiting in the lobby to grab on our way out.  The hotel is big, but manages to convey warm and personal hospitality.   Wish we could have stayed a little longer. ",5,2018,10,13
245,Good one night stay,"We recently stayed one night before departing Dublin. Check-in was prompt and the young lady who served us was very pleasant and helpful when I had questions.  I suspect we had one of the recently renovated room as everything appeared to be relatively new.  Bed was comfortable and shower/bathroom were clean and functional.  But two issues. 1. The outlet where the kettle and refrigerator were plugged into were not functioning.  I moved the tea tray and everything was then ok, but could not relocated the fridge.  2. We had a large room but there was only one chair in it, in addition to the desk chair. Given the room size and the fact two people occupied the room I would have expected a second chair or a couch. There was enough space.  The room looked very spartan as a result.  The restaurant was fine. We had dinner in it and breakfast the next morning, and both were fine.  But I am still waiting for my tea.............two weeks after checking out.  If circumstances warranted I would stay again.",4,2018,10,13
245,Disappointment,"We booked this via booking website and I know that most of the times you don't get the best rooms with this options, but the one we were staying at looked really rundown. The biggest disappointment, though, was the swimming pool. We chose this particular hotel to stay overnight before flying elsewhere, precisely because it boasts a swimming pool - which is a short walk away. When we got there, though, we discovered that they don't accept children - not even when they can swim and are accompanied by their parent(s). Really a let down. Only positive notes: the quality of sleep, considering you are so much near the airport it was amazing, plus the shuttle to the airport- the drivers are really kind and very helpful.",3,2018,10,11
245,emergency stay when flight was canclled,"Our flight out of Dublin was cancelled so we booked the Radisson Blu as a last minute stopover. 

What a great hotel, modern, spotless, large, friendly staff and an excellent room. We had dinner in the restaurant which was well above our expectations with attentive staff and with really nice decor.

Shuttle bus the next morning back to departures as well. Perfect",4,2018,10,11
245,A bit disappointing,"This is the 2nd time we've stayed at Radisson Blu. On our previous visit, they were fine. A simple airport hotel that gave us a room and a bathroom. We weren't after too much.
Alas, this time, we had some issues. We traveled with a baby. I said during both my initial booking and via an email that we needed a travel cot. When we arrived in our room after a 24hr flight, we found no cot. When we called up to ask for one, we were told that there were none left, and that we could use the bedding from the spare bed so our baby could sleep on the floor.
Now, caveat, the night manager did call us up and apologise for this issue and the suggestion that our baby sleep on the floor. He managed to source a cot from another hotel, so he at least redeemed the situation a bit. However, once you note one error, you can't help but notice a few others. The room felt quite dated, with a pretty poor shower (something we were really looking forward to). We ordered room service which was pretty bland and certainly not worth the cost.
On the positive side, the breakfast was quite nice the next morning. And as I said, the night manager did rectify the situation to some degree.
It's an airport hotel, so I wasn't really expecting much. It would be easy to send us on our way happy if you get the basics right. But when you get a crucial thing wrong, and combine it with the other little details, it does make us question whether we would return and perhaps try a different hotel next time we fly into Dublin.",2,2018,10,10
245,Great Airport Hotel,Our shuttle driver from and to the airport was friendly.  Check in was quick and efficient.  The guest room was very clean and an acceptable size for one night.  The restaurant had excellent food and the service was great.,5,2018,10,09
245,One Night,"It all went well I am returning in 2 days, so If I am returning it speaks for its self, I would not return to a hotel that was not satisfactory. The lady at reception did say that there were up dates being done to some of the bathrooms on certain floors but I was not on the floor with the changes.",4,2018,10,08
245,Stopover due to late arrival of flight.,Needed to catch a bus to the West the next morning and flight arrived at 1.30 am so booked to stay over.  Had stayed before on outward and inward journey and find the hotel convenient for the airport. Lovely comfortable rooms and facilities.,4,2018,10,07
245,Terrible,Save some money and stay at another airport hotel.  They initially put us in a rooms that was in the midst of heavy remodeling with heavy dust everywhere. Next front desk agent said no one should be on that floor. Restaurant service was horrible. Room was very tired looking and bath fixtures were rusty.   ,1,2018,10,06
245,Exceptional,Hotel was clean and tidy. Staff were friendly. Facilities were great. Excellent facility for parking and staying. Made travelling up from down the country worthwhile the night before our flight. Worth every penny.,5,2018,10,03
245,"Second time around, not so good.","The rooms are adequate but pricey.  Clean but with a few issues.  Restaurant, unlike last year provided adequate but not outstanding food, deplorable service and a very, very hostile manager from the former Eastern Bloc.  It would appear that the entire service industry is populated with migrants, some providing outstanding service, some not so much.  I would not stay at this property again.",3,2018,10,02
245,Comfort with a sigh of relief...,"I stay at Dublin Airport several times a year, en route to here or there, going or coming so the stays are one night only, but important for me as a tired international traveler. The shuttle to the Radisson Blu stops right in front of Terminal 2 so it’s convenient on arrival if coming in there. (The other hotels go to a lot near Terminal 1, a bit of hike). But it’s easy for the driver to miss you so watch and wave if you can. On my three visits to the hotel so far I have been warmly greeted and given a comfortable room in this large hotel and found the facilities for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner to be excellent. And when booking directly with the hotel I was pleased to receive a voucher for a drink and for dessert which was appreciated. I really think the restaurant is the best I’ve tried in the airport hotels and the early evening special is great value. All of the staff I’ve met have been helpful and friendly but for me the real test came when I had a family emergency and had to change my non-changeable reservation by a week. Phoning the manager I was given the courtesy of changing my dates with no charge and I felt they really saved the day (& my bank balance) which has made me a loyal customer. So go, stay, have dinner! And wave at that courtesy driver (he’s a great guy).",5,2018,10,02
245,Not for business travellers,"This hotel is sitting in Dublin Airport, should be getting a lot of business travellers, but not fit--for-purpose for business travellers. Hoteliers need to appreciate that WiFi is essential, for conference calls, connectivity. At this hotel to connect to the WiFi one has to register an email ID and password (did not work), register through facebook (also did not work) or register through LinkedIn (ALSO DID NOT WORK).  I lost 30 mins trying to simply get on the internet with old/legacy/outdated technology that no one uses and I failed (I have a PhD in Computer Science!!!). In the end, I had to tether through my Mobile phone to get internet access. Absolutely ridiculous, simply not fit for purpose for business travellers. 

Checkin was like a bomb hit it, just a complete mess, no organisation, decor and facilities were really poor. I counted 15 separate attempts on 15 separate room cards before they could enable a keycard for my room. So a 2 mon checkin took substantially longer. 

Rooms are average, close to 2 star quality.

Luckily, I have other options in Dublin airport when I come again, these other options were not available on this trip, and it made me appreciate the Maldron is a far better/more suited hotel for business travellers.",1,2018,09,30
245,Dublin airport,"Convenient to airport, great customer service.  We dropped off our rental car and cut his saddle straight to the hotel. Nice dinner at collage And in the morning there was a shuttle is leaving every 15 minutes for the airport.",5,2018,09,28
245,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on route to our early morning ferry. The room was huge as huge with a large shower. Everything was spotless too. As we were heading off early we didn’t have breakfast but there was water, fruit and snacks available to take away in reception which was a nice touch. Would definitely stay there again,",5,2018,09,24
245,Convenient but rooms badly in need of a facelift ,"Positives are it’s perfect for early morning flights with good parking facilities and an excellent shuttle bus service for both terminals. They also offer coffee, tea, water and fruit for those on early morning flights. We were leaving at 5.30 so this was very convenient. 

This hotel was probably at its best in the early 2000’s and the rooms and halls are badly in need of a makeover. Beds are comfortable but rest of decor is very shabby. 

Overall would recommend if you get a deal including parking as it’s very convenient and avoids all the hassle with early morning  departures. 

",3,2018,09,24
245,"Great food, friendly service, poor upkeep","This hotel was exceptional for its friendly staff and convenience to the airport. It was disappointing in its lack of service follow up. In 3 days, they never managed to clear up a sink issue- sink did not drain right, causing it to fill top and preventing further use for an unreasonable time. The toilet stopper leaked, making frightening loud hissing and whistling noises whenever it was flushed - and period would make loud banging noises in the wall that shook the whole room. These issues were reported to the front desk twice in 3 days, but never fixed.",2,2018,09,23
245,Exceptionally comfortable beds,Stayed one night as We had a very early flight next day. Lovely meal in the restaurant but the best bit was how comfortable the beds were. If I could take it home with me I would! I can definately recommend and would return.,4,2018,09,23
245,Amazing Airport Hotel with Everything!,"We checked in  after midnight, but found the staff to be very accommodating despite the late hour.  Let us order a drink even though the bar was closed and served us in the lounge area.  Breakfast was amazing, and the staff was most charming.",5,2018,09,23
245,Windy outside cold inside,"I had to stay overnight in this hotel because of a cancelled flight due to windy weather. Having a room at the top 5th floor the wind got into the room through leaky windows which was a bit uncomfortable. Also, the room was quite loud - not only because of the nearby airport but also a door connecting two rooms directly and family living there. Apart from that - all was OK. For those having early flights - breakfast starts at 6:30 am which is a bit too late in my opinion. Also, the shuttle bus goes every 15mins from the hotel but you can easily reach airport on foot which takes approx 5-7min.",4,2018,09,23
245,Excellent,Was checked in by Brendan. Very friendly and welcoming. Clean rooms. Lovely hotel. Could not fault the place. Got a wake up call as I was catching a plane in the early hours of the morning. Got the shuttle bus to my terminal as the hotel provides,5,2018,09,22
245,Convenient to airport,The hotel is a pragmatic solution if you have a late arrival followed by early morning flight. You will not get any closer to the terminal and an efficient shuttle.with helpful courteous driver is provided.,4,2018,09,22
245,Rooms need updaing,"The service at the hotel was very nice and efficient, and the food good in the restaurant for dinner. Access to the nearby health club was very convenient. The rooms need updating, they need more devices to charge electronic gadgets and the bathrooms are also  in need of some updating.  Would remind the housekeeping team to close doors to pantries as it was open each and every time I passed so you can see into all the back of house areas. ",4,2018,09,22
245,"Nice Staff but Last Century Infrastructure even in my ""Business Class"" Room","Very Nice and accommodating staff, but the rooms are so last century.  My room was a throw back to 1970s Irish country hotel though the bed was very comfortable.  It took me a while to figure out how to get the toilet to flush, basically you had to remove the cover from the water tank and then flush (perhaps a water conservation measure).  Rooms are jaded though I appreciated the Nepresso coffee machine.  Decent breakfast also.  The towels were well worn but very clean.  A 'sad case' really as the staff were so nice (with the exception of the bimbo who checked me out who was not at all apologetic about the fact that I had to take the lid off the loo everytime I flushed it -- perhaps that is how her loo works) but they are working with a last century infrastructure.  You can do better in 21st century Ireland.",2,2018,09,20
245,Pleasant stay,"We overnighted and had a generally pleasant stay, although in the morning we noted a large cobweb over the bedroom mirror as we were leaving.  This was reported to housekeeping and rather shook our confidence in the overall cleanliness of the hotel.",4,2018,09,18
245,Convenient and Nice,"Its a nice place to stay near airport. Our room was spacious and had a beautiful big window giving nice view of airport with aeroplanes landing and taking off. It was not as noisy as we expected and we had a very comfortable night sleep. Breakfast was included in the price and I think the best ever breakfast in all the hotels we have stayed near Dublin airport so far. The little extra details like the honey comb at the buffet and fresh fragrant flowers arrangements at the main entrance gave an extra edge. 
Parking was not free.",4,2018,09,16
245,Handy airport hotel,"The hotel is walking distance to the airport terminal, a shuttle bus is also available. The rooms require updating, Furniture dated. Shower screen leaked a little.  However the room was clean. Dining facilities are good. Very friendly staff.",3,2018,09,10
245,Great hotel very good location,Great breakfast and good dining menu rooms are very clean and nice beds are great ideal for a good night sleep .  Quite rooms. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. I will definitely return back with my family,5,2018,09,08
245,Short stay,I spent one night here in order to get an early flight the next morning. The room was fine. Food is served in their newish restaurant (Collage) rather than the bar where I had previously dined. You no longer have to watch football on large screen tv's while eating. The shuttle bus got me to the terminal without any problems.,4,2018,09,08
245,Hasn’t improved in 20 years,"This hotel is no better than when it was Great Southern where I stayed 20 years ago.
The hot water on the 4th floor hasn’t been fixed and still goes hot and cold.
Lighting controls are confusing.
Shower is stand up in the bath with a non slip map on request. Water mixer on shower is ineffective and has never been updated.
Glass shower door won’t stay in place so water goes over the floor.
Food and beverage area has been improved but hot plates not available at breakfast as plate warmers not effective hence in minutes hot food is cold.
Can’t recommend unless only other option is to sleep in the streets ",3,2018,09,06
245,Convenient and professional,stayed prior to flying out on our holidays. Brilliant idea. stress free. beautiful dinner.Business class room exceptional. Best feature shuttle to and from the airport. Conrad and team were exceptionally efficient friendly and prompt.,5,2018,09,01
245,Airport hotel that does it's job efficiently,"There is not much one expects of an airport hotel except efficiency and comfort. The Radisson Blu met these basic requirements.It had a good car park, 24 hour-airport shuttle every 15 minutes, porters/drivers to help with our sizable luggage,even  a weighing scale for it! A large room, and a basic restaurant gave us a good start to our long travel day next morning.",3,2018,08,31
245,SMALL uncomfortable double bed - no sleep,"Needed to catch a 7am flight so staying here seemed the best option. Large room but for some reason THE smallest of double beds. Slept really badly, very glad to get up and leave. Expensive for what it is. Conveyor belt approach at reception, “pay now or in morning”. No breakfast included in high price. Waited outside in cold for 10 mins, along with 11 others, shuttle driver had clearly gone MIA, but it turned up just as a porter started up a second vehicle. Needed both in the end to transport 13 people and luggage!",3,2018,08,29
245,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel. Very Nice breakfast, and good service. 
Needed help for some lunch to bring to an assessment day - they fixed it for One. 
Clean and nice rooms and a compfy bed. 
Close to the airport and Nice shuttlebus service, also in the middle of the Night.",5,2018,08,28
245,Great staff- Old hotel,Personel were warm. It says concierge in the booklet in the room but there is none in the hotel. There is no safe in the room. No ear cottons in the bathroom. Mini bar had only bottles of water which were complimentary. Not worth the money I paid at all.,3,2018,08,28
245,Lovely and Convenient Hotel,"Free shuttle bus service with a great friendly driver. Hotel was extremely clean and staff member very friendly! Room size was very generous and a great shower!

Although brief I will definitely be looking to stay here when i return to Dublin!",5,2018,08,28
245,Family vacay,"Well, it’s obvious why we opted to stay here. We missed our flight home and couldn’t leave till the next day. I booked the room while my husband was changing our ticket. The rate was very reasonable especially at the last minute. The room was standard, faced the rooftop, no biggie but I loved the bathroom! It had an Art Deco look to it. The restaurant had delicious food, try the seafood chowder.",5,2018,08,26
245,Not a Comfortable Sleep,"Check in was fast and efficient. Staf super friendly and helpful. Shuttle drivers kind and fun. Lovely tea/coffee in room. Greta after a long flight, Good TV sorry it didnt have CNN International.
There was only a shower in my room which was a disappointment. After that the worst issue was the bed - rotten, rough and itchy sheets and horrible BIG, FAT pillows impossible to get comfortable with. I tried over and over again in my lseep and realized the pillows stunk - one of men's after shave (I am a woamn traveling alone) and one like mildew/dampness. EWWWW I wanted to puke. If I wasnt so tired I would have called the front desk.

Id like to give the hotel a better review but the bed and dirty pillows really put me off. Please note: THIS IS NOT A CHEAP HOTEL. Inpaid over 200 Euros for one night,",2,2018,08,24
245,Paying for the Location,"This is probably the least impressive Radisson property I’ve stayed at. Maintenance on the building seems sketchy (windows supposedly locked but left unlocked and this hack job of ceiling wire holding this window in the hallway together)

The bar/restaurant food is mediocre at best and the selection is limited.  Walk over to the McDonalds up the block.  

The rooms seem like they are from a basic 3 star hotel of the 90s (no outlets by the bed, crappy pillows, dated bathroom fixtures/HVAC ,etc) not very much CapEx going into this place.  Also the WiFi is HORRIBLE. (Can’t even load basic websites sometimes)

Staff is friendly and there is a shuttle to the terminals every 15 mins 24/7. 

For those reasons, I would not recommend this hotel. 
",2,2018,08,22
245,Honeymoon,We began our honeymoon with Radisson Blu Dublin Airport to take the stress from getting to the airport the following morning for our flight. From the shuttle driver to the front of house team the staff are incredible. We look forward to staying again in the future! ,5,2018,08,21
245,Don't expect too much,"We stayed here for a day room as we had landed from the US at 4 in the morning and did not have another flight until that afternoon. For a bed for a couple hours sleep it was fine. The bed wasn't the most comfortable and the pillows could stand to be replaced. There was no sofa in the room we had and breakfast wasn't included, so not a great deal for the money. It is an easy 15 minute walk from Terminal 2 which the only reason that I gave it 3 stars.",3,2018,08,20
245,"Room,bed& couch","Room,bed&couch couch not comfortable and did not provide a good nights sleep , price expensive for room only and no breakfast . Please review family rooms and include even a basic cereal breakfast for guests.Thanks",3,2018,08,20
245,Comfortable for transfer in Dublin airport,"Really close to the airport, shuttle going every 15 minutes. Huge Irish breakfast, big rooms, polite and professional personal. But very high price of breakfast, 19 euro. And as everywhere in Ireland high price for some drinks.",5,2018,08,17
245,David Inglis,all round excellent experience. I will be backGreat LocationFast efficient serviceGreat food and a great bar with friendly staffSylvia at Reception was very helpfulWhen I stay with the family the staff always find a solution for the childrens fold out bed even when it was not in the booking.Very helpful,5,2018,08,14
245,Extremely disappointed,"I made a reservation well in advance as I was travelling to Canada with my daughter and her two children, ages 5 and 7. Our plan was to travel to the hotel (one hour car journey and two hour train journey) and overnight there as we had an early morning departure. I checked with the hotel a couple of days prior to arrival to ensure all was in order. When enquiring about the pool for the children (as I had read on tripadvisor that the pool was under construction), I was assured that the pool would be available on our day of arrival. I explained that this was the main purpose of selecting this hotel, as I knew the children would enjoy the afternoon of swimming, and burn off energy for a good nights sleep. On arrival at 12.50 hrs, the receptionist asked us to wait in the lobby or restaurant as we could not check in until 14.00 hrs. We went to the bistro cafe and ordered lunch. This was a little awkward as there was only one girl behind the counter, and she was clearly overstretched trying to place orders and serve. We went to check in at 14.30, and after completing the process, I asked for access to the pool for the children. I was told that the children could only use the pool from 9.00 hrs until 13.00 hrs and that we were too late! Imagine.......this was the first time I had been given this information, although I had been in contact twice before check in, and once when I was ready to check in.  Also imagine the disappointment for the children as they had been promised ""fun in the pool"" after our journey's end. It was a very disappointing experience for all of us at the beginning of our holiday. Not a good experience, nothing offered to make up for the disappointment, and not even an apology. I won't return to this hotel.",2,2018,08,10
245,"Convenient, comfortable airport option","My husband and I stayed here one night in August 2018 due to an unexpected airline snafu. It was a perfectly fine stay -- convenient airport shuttle, helpful staff, nice room, and good bar, restaurant, and breakfast buffet. If I ever need to stay near the Dublin airport again, I'll choose this hotel.",4,2018,08,06
245,Exceptional hotel near airport,"My daughter and I stayed in very high-end hotels and castles on our trip, so we didn't expect much from this hotel, as the price was very affordable and it was near the airport.  However, we were pleasantly surprised.  The room was extremely clean and nice and the bed was very, very comfortable.  The view of the airport was actually really pretty.  (We were on the 5th floor.)  The food was delicious (especially their gluten free pizza) and the staff was exceptional.  I can't imagine a nicer hotel near the airport.",5,2018,08,03
245,Third time lucky,"We flew into DUB from Europe and had an overnight stay at the airport before our return to Canada. Finding the location for the pick up for the Radisson shuttle van took 40 minutes. There are no clear signs or instructions in Terminal 2. We initially went to the wrong location but eventually found the correct spot. The van drivers were very helpful and friendly.
 The girl at reception spoke too quietly and did not address us directly. Our first room was only 18C and the heating did not appear to be working. We were given a second room, though again the girl on reception did not apologize or look at us. The second room and corridor had been painted one week previously. The stinging smell of paint  hurt our eyes and gave my wife a headache. Finally we were given a third room which was warm and free of paint odour. This arrival experience was BAD. Also I do not care for hard wood type floors.",3,2018,07,31
245,Overnight Stay,"Decided to stay here as we had a morning flight to catch. Cannot complain. A solid hotel. Rooms were big and clean. Bathroom, although small, was clean. Breakfast was included in our price. This was very good and a lot to choose from. Glad we are returning in a couple of weeks at the end of our holiday.
",4,2018,07,31
245,Overnighter,"We stayed here for one night after our long flight from Australia. The staff were welcoming and friendly, the food in the restaurant was good. Then came the room, the bed was a pull down one, not the most comfortable and the legs were a trip hazard. A little note was found in the bathroom, after my wife had slid over in the bath ""If you need a bath mat ask at reception"", Obviously they knew the bath was slippery when wet, so this should have been a standard accessory in the bathroom.",3,2018,07,31
245,No complaints.....,"Stayed here, as family were arriving on a late flight and was a better alternative than a 3 hour drive home.
Got a good deal, booked late too, seemed a great price for what this hotel usually charges.
After reading reviews re the hotel, was slightly worried but must admit, I couldnt complain about anything and I would be fussy enough.
Upon arrival, checked in, went to my room and then straight to the bar to see a match, bar man put it on....I then asked for the menu for bar food, was only pizza and I think, chicken wings.
Ordered the pizza, thinking the worst but to be honest, it was actually one of the nicest pizzas I have had.
Breakfast had everything I would like, a cooked breakfast, hard to beat.. Only small complaint would be, would rather chopped up mushrooms than that big mushroom that nearly takes up whole plate..
Bottom line...would I stay here again? A definite YES",5,2018,07,28
245,Well done,"My friend, who isn’t young, had a very delayed UK flight into Dublin. Before it took off, she felt unable to complete her journey home, due to the late arrival. 
She asked me to help and, around 11pm,  I booked her into The Radisson Blu. It wasn’t cheap (but the booking websites offered a slightly better price than phoning the hotel reservation line). 
Where the hotel excelled though, was that I was able to speak to the reception desk and explain that, while my credit card guaranteed the booking, the person arriving at the desk had a different name. The last thing she needed was a lot of questions at 1 am!! 
She tells me that check in was seamless, she had an extremely comfortable night and breakfast was top class.
Well done Radisson Blu. ",5,2018,07,27
245,A Couple Just Passing Through,The hotel was very clean and delivered a very good service. The staff was particularly helpful especially the driver who transferred us from the hotel to the airport. His help was particularly valuable.,5,2018,07,26
245,Stop over," We found staff very friendly and very obliging, the food was excellent and we really enjoyed our stay. Room was great very clean and very comfortable. It was grand and quite especially being so close to Dublin Airport.",5,2018,07,25
245,Perfectly decent with well appointed rooms,"Stayed here the other night after yet another BA cancelled flight.  Rooms are freshly decorated, spacious and well appointed.  Bars good with lots of space, lounge is a de ent space too.  This does exactly what it says on the tin.",3,2018,07,24
245,Will not return,"Stayed here several times and always got our holiday off to a good start. We normally ate the bar food which was really good but the restaurants have changed and we were looking forward to this experience. Found the menu choice a little odd but the food when it arrived can only be described as poor. Breakfast the next morning was lukewarm on cold plates and thevwaiter just strolled around obviously bored. Some of the reception staff were very sullen. I appreciate efficient which I could not fault but maybe a smile and eye contact would be nice too. Only one shuttle bus running. Driver very pleasant but one bus in July is just ridiculous,. We will not stay here again. ",2,2018,07,24
245,Wouldn’t stay again,"It is close to the airport so the location is good. 
The wifi in the rooms doesn’t work well. The TV didn’t work, the bathroom wasn’t very clean. 
If I had to book a hotel at the airport again, I would do research on others before staying here again. ",2,2018,07,23
245,3 nights.,"Hospitality and welcome from genuinely friendly team excellent. Housekeeping (in room) poor. Otherwise cleanliness excellent throughout, but you notic eth room over 3 nights! Food in Collage very good . Hotel spacious and well designed but looking  a little tired and in need of a refresh after 10 or so years since opening.",3,2018,07,21
245,"Decent experience, but mostly paying for the location.","My husband and I stayed here before an early flight from Dublin. Room was perfectly clean and serviceable, though bathrooms are tired and dated. Prices are steep comparative to quality. The bar area is quite dark and lifeless, service could be slow. Food in Collages was tasty though again, overpriced. The location is however hard to beat. After reading that the shuttle bus could be a bit unreliable we were able to walk to the terminal the next morning in less than 10mins. Not quite sure overall if we’d stay here again however. ",3,2018,07,21
245,Quality lacks,"Reserved a room many weeks before my stay at about 200 euro per night. It was the cheapest I could find at the time around the airport, and was surprised to see the rate change to 159 when I checked the night before.

So I canceled and made a new reservation at 159. This already does not strike me as right, if I reserve well in advance I should get the better rate, but apparently they keep rates high at first.

I checked in late and got a ‘business’ room. 

The bed was done up well, good sheets, good mattress. Good size room. The bathroom was aweful. Bath was chipped at different places, shower head had been changed to a handheld one. So now in 2018 we are still showering holding up the shower head Turk go to wash with the other?

Bathroom was flooded after because the glass that swings over the bath edge had worn strip of insulating.

The faucet dropped all night, no way to tighten the handles to make it stop. 

On the positive side it was quiet.

The bedside lamp did not work well and turned off and on by itself.

The next morning I checked out and went outside to wait for the shuttle. It was delayed and quite a few people were waiting outside already.

When it arrived I asked the driver whether we would all fit and he said we had to wait for the next one.

I grabbed a cab and wasted another 10 euro getting to the terminal less than 1 mile away.

Don’t stay here if you are used to a bit of quality and good service.",1,2018,07,21
245,"Not really Radisson Blu standard, just average","Like most airport hotels, keeping up with wear and tear is a challenge for this hotel. The windows are not noise-proof and the doors slam hard.  My room was tired, with torn fabric in the chair, large chips missing from the bedside table, and an antiquated bathroom (worn fittings, narrow shower, and no bench space for personal toiletries).

It isn’t quite walking distance from the terminal, but the shuttle ride is very short and it runs every fifteen minutes (at least). ",3,2018,07,19
245,Tired and not what you expect from a Radisson - and it is NOT a spa!!!!,"It's a tired hotel which is very rough around the edges. Perhaps Raddisson don't feel they need to invest in this one as it has a steady stream of custom. So they don't feel a compulsion to keep the standards as high as their other hotels. The room was ok. The bathroom was not great. Shower curtain falling off, tiles dirty and just generally something i'd expect from a budget hotel.
I booked this hotel as i had a lot of time to kill in the afternoon and thought hte spa facilities would help me kill time. HAHAHA. This is NOT a spa. It is a swimming pool straight out of a history movie. Imagine what your parents would have gone to swim in when they were kids. It's like an old lido. They DO NOT provide towels for hotel guests so bring your own towel. I was also charged 9 Euros to use the spa. So not complimentary as advertised. 
You don't mind rough around the edges if you pay those prices. You don't mind a rough and ready spa if it's adverstised as such 
Neither the case in this case.

Positives - staff all very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was good and the location is hard to beat if you are flying in and out at inconvenient times. I just think a bit of a refresh is needed and perhaps some more authentic descriptions of the Spa wouldn't go a miss.",2,2018,07,19
245,DON’T EAT the breakfast! ,"We were there only over a night so we were looking forward to the breakfast and then leave, when i first felt the smell from the scrambled eggs I asked one of the worker there and she said it’s pre-maid. That they get a tank of liquid from the fabric and just put it in the oven. A Classic hotel breakfeast dish, is now pre-maid from fabric just indicates how low, disgusting and pathetic this ”hotel” trying to be. ",1,2018,07,18
245,Below average with bathroom maintenance.,"Folks at the counter were helpful with all our requests.  Breakfasts were tasty.  Breakfast hostess and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful.  Our bathroom was in need of maintenance.  Everything worked, however the esthetics were a disappoint.  There were cracks in the silicon around the tub.  The knob that turned the shower on was impossible to turn without a guerrilla grip. Under the sink looked like a shade tree fixer upper had been there on their first training repair.  BTW the room was 224.",3,2018,07,17
245,"Average room, excellent room service ","We stayed at the Radisson Blu, Dublin Airport after a delayed flight left us too tired to drive home that same night. 

The hotel is two minutes (max) from the airport car park so it is a perfect location. 

We have stayed in the Premier Inn previously when using the airport and the rooms there are smarter and more up to date. In the Radisson, we were in a business class room. There was a coffee machine with pods which was great. The bed was comfortable the the room was a decent size but the bathroom was very small and a bit shabby in comparison with similar chain hotels I have stayed in. We had robe and slippers and water in the fridge. 

No sockets near the bed. Annoying in any room but particularly strange for a 'business' room. 

We ordered room service because we were too tired to go to the restaurant and I have to say, it was some of the best I have had. We both had the TV meal deal of a burger and chips and cheesecake. This deal comes with a beer but the restaurant gave us bottles of water instead at our request. 

We had to pay €7.50 for the car park overnight which I was a bit miffed about as when we stayed at the premier inn Dublin airport, the parking was free. That hotel is five/ten minutes away though so I guess you pay more for being closer to the airport. 
",4,2018,07,13
245,Convenient to Airport ,"I have stayed at this Radisson Blu many times, this was my first non business stay. 

I had always walked from the hotel to the airport, we used the the shuttle service provided this time that made runs every fifteen minutes with plenty of space for luggage.

The Hotel is clean, well appointed and pleasant. The front desk staff ensure that they have one staff to check in Flight Crews so that you aren’t waiting to check in like other airport hotels.  

They have a car park that does charge for use after a 20 minutes, I had enough time to check us in, get our luggage to our room and get our rental car returned without incurring any cost.

The breakfast is well worth it, great selection of meats, fruits, veggies and eggs to order.

With its proximity to DUB airport, it is perfect to stay the night before your flight.",4,2018,07,09
245,Great location with tired rooms ,"The major positive is the hotels proximity to the airport. Unlike many of the other airport hotels it’s actually possible to walk to the terminal as was the case with my stay; the hotel bus was full. 

The hotel staff are welcoming and efficient. The reception, bar area and restaurant all have a modern feel and are in keeping with what one expects from a Radisson hotel but go beyond the ground floor and you’ll conclude that a  refurb of the rooms is needed. As my photos testify there are things the hotel could do to help: clean the windows, lick of paint, etc.  

Since my last stay there is a new restaurant which I ate at: great service with average food served at a premium (prices have certainly increased). My family were asked to leave the hotel bar at 10:00 pm because we had our 12 year son with us. Ireland’s draconian laws to blame here, although I thought hotels guests were excluded from this anti children policy. I did ask reception about this but nobody was able to provide any clarity; is it any wonder I holiday with my family in locations were children are welcomed at all hours. 

I’ll conclude by stating a simple fact; I was charged €180 for a room (2 adults x 1 child) that was tired and dated. The room overlooked a bin yard and was beyond basic. You are actually paying for the location. Radisson, in my experience, you are better than this. ",3,2018,07,09
245,Good location okay hotel,Hotel was in a good location to the airport shuttles run every 15 minutes which is nice. Having coffee available in the lobby in the morning would be great. 3 Euros for a coffee from the restaurant that I had to get myself seemed a bit much.,4,2018,07,06
245,A good hotel with close access to the airport.," This hotel provides close proximity to the airport with excellent new and upgraded rooms. The staff was friendly and attentive to our every need. Check in and check out was seamless.  The only thing that I would have changed was the option of breakfast. For the cost of the room, breakfast definitely should’ve been included. ",4,2018,07,06
245,nice before early flight,only stayed 1 night before early morning long haul flight good evening meal and very good breakfast nice pool very friendly staff and very comfy beds loads of hot water and nice fluffy towels very relaxing before long trip,5,2018,06,30
245,Short stop,"Didn’t expect much but pleasantly surprised. Room spotless, bed and bathroom likewise. Resturant, fillet steak perfect, salad to die for, Ellen my server, professional, polite, engaging, knowledgeable, highly recommended.  If I was to open a restaurant I would want a number of Ellen’s!",5,2018,06,27
245,My Stay,"My stay, although brief was excellent.  Walking distance to the airport, which I took advantage of.  Only issue I can think of was that I was not told when I arrived that the water bottles in the room were complementary.",4,2018,06,27
245,Disappointing,"Two nights booked, one before travel and one after. Business class room. We had requested a low floor room, which was confirmed by e mail. First time 2 nd floor, next time 3 rd floor. At least one could have expected second floor two times...The lady at reception spoke so silently that she was hard to understand with the noise. Hey, some people are not native speakers and do not hear 100% well.....Furniture very worn and old fashioned. In the first room, the working table was lower than the chair ! One would expect differently from a Scandinavian branded hotel. Price was very high for what we got.",2,2018,06,26
245,Nice for a airport location,"We had a short stopover which worked well following a late night flight from Italy, great value. The rooms were large and suited our family we enjoyed the breakfast which was included in our room rate.",4,2018,06,25
245,Sylvia is a Lifesaver!,"My daughter was leaving Dublin this morning after a study abroad.  On her way to the airport on a public bus, she became severely motion sick.  While boarding her flight to the US, one of her professors mentioned to the flight attendant that our daughter had been sick (even though she was feeling fine at that point).  Long story short, she was removed from the plane and told she couldn't fly until the next day-airline policy. 
Frantic, we were trying to figure out what she should do.  A friend of mine who travels to Dublin frequently mentioned the Radisson Blu as a place to stay until she could fly out tomorrow.  However, she needed to be cleared by a dr before she is allowed to fly.  I called the 800# and they transferred me to the hotel directly.  I spoke with SYLVIA at the front desk. She was so helpful and told me exactly what our daughter needed to do.  Our daughter caught the shuttle and Sylvia called the dr for her and made an appointment for the dr to come check her out at the hotel.  They even called the dr again for her when it was over 2 hours later than they said he be.
I can't comment on the quality of the hotel itself as this is not important to us at this moment.   But the customer service our 20 year old received is something I will always be grateful for!!  Thank you, Sylvia!",5,2018,06,23
245,Awful,"We arrived late after midnight, we had 2 rooms, one was supposed to be high level upgrade, well if an upgrade includes a toilet that does not flush, air conditioning that you could not regulate, room was freezing, I called for blankets front desk said they were in the room, I asked where and he said in the room, we used travel blankets and used the other room for the bathroom.  The staff was rude and really wanted nothing more than to ignore you, with a serious problem.  First time at a Raddisson and last time for me.",1,2018,06,23
245,Nice hotel little pricey,Always stay in this hotel for next day flight.Close to airport and to Dublin Centre.Slovak speaking personal was big help for my dad who don't speak english.Receptionist was so helpful.Purchased room with breakfast $267.00 per night little more than i expected but service was excelent.,5,2018,06,22
245,Overpriced and average rooms and service ,"This hotel is way way overpriced because of its location. Rooms very average, normally hitting basic 3 star level. Bed comfortable and room clean. Services in hotel limited. Restaurant food overpriced too for average standard of food and wine. Totally taking advantage of location. Wake up calls not reliable and rooms noisy as guests usually using hotel cause they have very wary flights. Bathroom needs renovation and car parking expensive. Also shuttle bus to terminals not reliable. Avoid if you can! ",2,2018,06,20
245,Very Disapointed,"Stayed here a coupl;e of weeks back.Have always been treated very nice when I have stayed here. The room we were given was very shabby, overlooking a tin roof.  The toilet handle you had to press twice to get it to flush.  I did ask for my room to be changed, but to no avail.  In dire need of a make over.  Very disappointed.  Am travelling to portugal in October, but won't be staying here",2,2018,06,20
245,Overpriced & underwhelming ,"The rooms are basic to say the least. They are in dyer need of renovation. The room I stayed in had furniture with cigarette burns all over them.

The restaurant in the hotel was newly upgraded but to be honest the food was EXTREMELY overpriced. I had the burger and it was absolutely a frozen burger which was deep fried and not a homemade one which was advertised on the menu. I know this as I am a chef.

The staff are very professional and very helpful. It’s just a pity the hotel isn’t as accommodating as the staff. Another plus is that the irons are actually steam irons and not the crap ones you get at other hotels.

I don’t recommend staying here unless you get a price which is worth it around €80. Don’t eat here the food is very poor.",2,2018,06,19
245,Avoid this place. It's really a 1980s Day's Inn.,"We paid nearly $600 to stay here two nights.  You'd expect a real five star experience for that much cash.  Our room was outdated, weird, a bit dirty.  The front desk folks were not very friendly; and the restaurant was deeply disappointing (and expensive).  The ONLY redeeming quality was the proximity to the airport, and the friendly shuttle driver that picked us up.  The shuttle ride back was packed like sardines (while the second shuttle was parked).",2,2018,06,18
245,way over priced for what it is,"had to pay €245 as all other hotels were fully booked.
had quite some expectations but really considering the price it just really isnt worth it.

yes its ok pretty standard rooms but i cant say anything to give that much credit for",3,2018,06,17
245,Great airport location,"Great location, stayed with friends, clean hotel, welcoming reception staff helpful.  very comfortable beds, fresh water lovely touch in reception. helpful house hold staff. breakfast service poor but everything else great ",4,2018,06,11
245,No response to request for repairs.,"Checked in around 1 PM, toilet in room did not work. (Would not flush, like the water was turned off). Called front desk ""John"" said some one will look into it. As we left for a day out I stopped back at reception and remined John about the toilet. He assured me some one was on the way.
Came back from our day in Dublin after 7PM, toilet was still broken! (it was never touched if you know what I mean). Called front desk, after 2 or 3 minutes still no answer. My wife went down and demanded to see the house manager.
The only one on duty was the Food& Beverage manager who came to the room and stated she could not fix the toilet.
She moved us to another room and all was well after that. (second room was MUCH nicer than the first one,)
Still the lack of response from a 4 star, chain hotel is unacceptable I felt I just got lip service from reception as they were too busy to help.",1,2018,06,09
245,Expensive for a very standard airport hotel,"Very expensive for a pre-night stay in a very standard room. In room service was awful - the poor kid who took my order did not even know what was on the menu let alone the offer of create your own meal. Less of marketing jargon and get your staff to get the info right. When pasta did arrive, it turned out to be spaggetti and the salt and pepper pot were empty!
Furniture was a collection of old table, chair and very basic. I have stayed in European cities with Radisson and they have been excellent. Still waiting for a response for a refund!",2,2018,06,09
245,A little bit of comfort near airport.,"Lovely, friendly staff will make your stay comfortable and more enjoyable. Room was beautiful with high end linens, lots of space, comfortable bed and pillows.  Bar and restaurant adequate but not overly exciting.  Food passable. The staff and rooms are the best attraction here. If you want to use the gym, you will be disappointed as the pool, jacuzzi and gym are about 10 minutes away.",4,2018,06,06
245,Expensive for a very standard hotel,"The rooms are looking very tired. I had a corner room which was actually quite large, but it had old, rather random, furniture and a pretty basic bathroom. 

The basics are fine - the bed is nice, as are the linens. And everything worked fine.  

It just shouldn't be any more than €150, even with its proximity to the airport.",3,2018,06,06
245,Comfortable Airport Hotel,"This hotel is clean and comfortable and is a short walk from Terminal 2, or you can hop on the terminal bus, if you prefer. The staff were very helpful, and an on-the-go early morning breakfast of cereal bars, fruit and assorted drinks, is provided for anyone departing before the restaurant is opened. The restaurant itself deserves mention. It is bright and airy with, I thought, an Oriental/modern feel to the décor. Its staff were very friendly and very attentive, constantly refilling our wine glasses, and the food was very good with large portions. I have no complaints.",5,2018,06,06
245,Essential stay for flight connection,To be totally honest I wish I stayed in the maldron which is actually closer to the terminals at Dublin and would actually of had an iron and ironing bouts int the room this hotel was the first choice on booking.com won’t stay here again and very expensive for the amenities 🤔,2,2018,06,05
245,Great airport hotel,Stayed one night before flight home. Nice updated room shower was fine with no problems. Bar area is good and serves a limited menu. 20 minute cab ride to town for about 25 euro. All in all a great airport hotel.,5,2018,06,03
245,"Cold water, cold service","Stayed here one night and would suggest anyone thinking of booking here thinks again.  

With no hot water when we arrived, a comedy of errors ensued, housekeeping telling us we’d be contacted to be moved, packing our stuff back up, no one moving us for an hour until I went down to reception who knew nothing of this, didn’t apologise, gave us another room, still no hot water, some bogus sounding excuse about ‘shower cartridges that heat the water’ that on questioning was clearly a lie by the manager, who promised to phone us up when there was water, and to discount the room. 

He never called back, and never discounted the room.  So not only did we pay full whack for a hotel with no water but it’s run by people who don’t talk to each other, can’t stick to their story and don’t honour their commitments.",1,2018,06,03
245,Traffic noise and empty minibar at premium prices,"In the room I measured 35-45 decibel on the smartphone sound measurement app and it never stopped. Dublin airport is operating 24/7. Radisson provides 2 bottles of complimentary water, but otherwise the minibar was empty. Room was clean and the bed comfortable, but 178 Euro/night is a steep price lying in a bed without sleeping.  ",2,2018,05,31
245,Great hotel IF you need to stay at Dublin Airport,"Due to a flight cancellation, we scrambled to find an airport hotel. Having checked out of a different hotel and needing to find another one, we chose Radisson Blu. Very high marks for the restaurant. Healthy food, craft gins (nice touch) and interesting cheeses. Great shuttle bus service to the airport. Very convenient.",4,2018,05,31
245,Wonderful stay,We stayed for the night it was the start of our honeymoon. When we arrived we went up to our room and discovered we had been up graded to a suite it was a lovley surprize for us. Next time we fly out we will book and stay again.,5,2018,05,31
245,Took a business room for that “little bit extra” - disappointing ,"The hotel is very close to the airport with a free shuttle every 15 mins and journey time is 5 mins (we walked as it was so close). The hotel has a good stay, park fly package - a major bonus.

The business room was quiet, clean and very comfortable and parts of 5he room had been nicely refurbished, yet some of the furniture / fittings were scratched and pretty tired looking, an old mix. Would have expected a room to be totally refurbished especially when one is paying extra for a business room",4,2018,05,30
245,Excellent Service,A very pleasant stay. Excellent staff throughout. The airport shuttle was great. If only you could change the awful piped mucic in the lobby area! Access to the swimming pool nearby is a good idea BUT not at weekends when it is used for children's swimming lessons.,5,2018,05,29
245,Great Place for Events and Functions,"Had an important meeting here and was very happy with the service provided. Staff are courteous and efficient, almost invisible which is ideal when a meeting is in progress. Will definitely recommend.",5,2018,05,27
245,Average Airport Hotel,"We stayed one night at the Radisson Blu when we were unexpectedly delayed during a transit from Amsterdam.  Fortunately, they had a vacancy.  The room was average.  It was stuffy when we walked in, but the air conditioner was effective and cooled it down.  the bed was comfortable.  Basically, a Holiday Inn room.  I do have to say that all the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, especially the airport shuttle drivers (free shuttle runs every 15 minutes).  Free breakfast buffet, but the eggs were of the powdered variety and pretty bad.  The rest of breakfast offerings were fine, though.",3,2018,05,27
245,Truly Average!,"Staying at this hotel for the last week with another week to go. Rooms are pretty good and so is the room service. I'm a vegetarian and there are hardly any options for breakfast just bread And potato wedges (and why would you not vary the menu is beyond my comprehension). Asked for the room to be changed to a higher floor (sam2 category but newly renovated) but the front offoce have declined and willing to do it just for the last couple of days.. come on, people here on long stay should surely get the preference. ",3,2018,05,27
245,Terrible value for money,"Very simply this is a 3 Star hotel pretending to be a 5 Star.
Badly trained staff who are doing their best in a challenging situation. Booked a business room at 310 euros for a 7 hour stopover . Check in was fine . The room was not .  Many of the facilities advertised weren’t in evidence so on calling reception I find that they have no business rooms available hence I was given a standard room. But that wasn’t communicated in check in and when I suggested it would have been a good  idea to let me know whilst checking in the front desk person said “ he didn’t know “ id booked a business Room suggesting we sort it out on check out . I eventually got a 40 euro discount accompanied by responses that were not what I would expect from a 5 Star Property . To Radisson HR : Your staff are out of their depth please train them Properly .

Long story short just don’t . Terrible value for money and incompetent staff who are not up to the job.",1,2018,05,24
245,Poor Relations In Group,Checked into hotel when we should have been at sister hotel how was we to know that there were two Radissun hotels in such a short space. If the receptionist had said when we told them  we had made a reservation and they assured us we had not they could have said just to make sure that you had not booked at Radissun just down the road,1,2018,05,23
245,Close to the airport,"Very expensive for a pizza and a few hours sleep, but a worry-free last stop before the Dublin airport. We were in Ireland for a week and this was the most expensive place that we stayed—and only for about 8 hours. ",5,2018,05,21
245,Walking distance from the Airport,"Spent 2 nights in this hotel, its an easy walk from either terminal although a courtesy bus is provided. The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are very comfortable. The breakfasts are excellent, with a large choice of hot and cold dishes available.The airport is handy for the city centre with a fast bus link to the city centre.",5,2018,05,20
245,Convenient & Accommodating,"We chose this hotel at the airport so that we could return the car the night before and head over to the airport first thing in the morning and it served both purposes very well. The lower level has been remodelled very nicely, especially the restaurant.  The rooms are clean, well equipped (with robes, hair dryer,  tea/coffee & a kettle), and it was relatively quiet considering you were right at the airport.  The shuttle service from Terminal 1 was very good both times we took it - on schedule & with friendly, helpful drivers. We especially enjoyed our evening meal in the restaurant where we received excellent service and accommodation of my food sensitivities by our waitress & chef. It was a very good hotel to spend the evening before a flight with good amenities.",4,2018,05,17
245,Good location & room; Bed and Restaurant service not great.,"Very close to airport. Nice room with good space and amenities. Not very comfortable night's sleep: bed was on wheels. Restaurant: quality food but service was quite erratic (unusually busy night for them, but multiple errors got frustrating).",3,2018,05,17
245,Excellent value and service,"Convenient,  helpful, great value. Helped us arrange a different night at the last minute, all staff we met went out of their way to be helpful and friendly.  I am very impressed with the service,  rooms clean and comfortable and for being so close to the airport,  surprisingly quiet.",5,2018,05,17
245,Warm welcome,Arrived 3am after frustrating baggage experience with Aer Lingus. 24hr shuttle service to this airport hotel was smooth and helpful. Front desk offered warm welcome. Wheelchair accessible room and breakfast were better than expected.,4,2018,05,17
245,Nice refurbished rooms,"When I checked in they allocated me a standard room that frankly looked like a bad holiday inn room.  I asked for an upgrade due to my hotel status at which point they gave me a refurbished room on the 5th floor.  MUCH better.  This is a typical Radisson Blu room with Nespresso coffee maker and very comfy bed.  The only downside is that they haven't got soundproof windows, so you do get a certain degree of airplane noise.  That being said you can practically walk to the airport from the hotel, although they have a free shuttle every 15 mins which takes approx 5 mins. 
Good location for the airport.",4,2018,05,13
245,Sent to another hotel 30 Miles away at Midnight due to over booking ,"I’m a Radisson member and Booked this room directly via the Radisson website a number of weeks ago.  

Our flight was delayed by 90 mins so landed in Dublin at 11:00pm 
Waited at airport 50 minutes for the Radisson airport shuttle (advertised as every 15 mins) to pick us up and arrived at hotel at 11:55pm only to learn our room had been given away as there had been flights cancelled earlier in the evening and they had double booked our room.  

Extremely rude front desk assistant showed no compassion. Told us because we had used booking.com we were being moved to another hotel.  
 
In spite of correcting him and showing we booked direct with Radisson he told us there were no more rooms. There had been 3 cancelled flights at the airport and Radisson accommodated stranded passengers in favour of our pre booking. 

He told us replacement hotel was 10 mins away.  Which turned out to be a blatant lie as we ended up in Ashbourne 30 miles north of Dublin and over 1/2 hour in a cab. 

Terrible experience. Radisson train your front of house staff properly if your policy is to bump existing customers.   And keep customers close to the airport rather than adding hours of inconvenience to our travel plans by moving us so far out.  

No one compensates you for inconvenience & and sheer rudeness do they ? 

Radisson you have lost our custom forever by gambling our room away. 
",1,2018,05,12
245,Not a four star ...,"You don t feel welcomed here at least with a smile. 
Rooms are not modernly furnished and the bed is like in a summer camp... pay attention to your feet as the bed legs are in metal and exceeding largely the length of the bed. It hurts ... 
do not expect to go to the airport by foot. It s more than 10mn walk with no particular path. Better take the shuttle. ",2,2018,05,11
245,Nothing Spectacular,"Stayed here as convenient for early morning flight. Check in was seamless and efficient. Not much of a welcome.
€254 for the night was very saucy.
Rooms clean, well appointed. Bed is comfy. Stayed in room 202 which is a business class room.
I could hear the alarm clock sound in the adjacent room which had me awake 45 mins before I was due to get up which was not of a bummer.

Bar was quiet, small selection of food on the menu unless you go into the restaurant.

For €254 a night. It's not worth it but if you want to stay close to the airport you gotta suck up the price!😩",3,2018,05,10
245,Overnight airport stay for an early morning pick up,The beds were extremely comfortable and the breakfast was superb. Value for money though could be better and thr room furnishings could be more modern. Overall a good trip and i may possibly be back in the future. A reasonably good hotel.,4,2018,05,08
245,Stay and Fly,Overnight stay before early flight. We wanted the convenience of a nights sleep before a 4am call. Got a nice quiet room and we will stay again on our return from our holiday. Parked our car for duration at €7.50 per night.,5,2018,05,08
245,Will visit again,"Quite hotel, nice big rooms and always clean, almost everything works allthough it normally doesn‘t in Dublin. Check-in and check-out both took me 2minutes. The shuttle bus does not drive as frequently as they say, but you can ask for it and you could also walk to Terminal 2 it‘ll take you about 3minutes as well. So you can take the bus to the city from the airport or get a taxi for ~20€.
We‘ll definitely visit again:)",5,2018,05,07
245,Night trip,"Nice hotel nice rooms, if you like looking at airport flight activity make sure they situate you in hotel front rooms ! I had the chicken wings, large bowl way too many go for the smaller portion especially if you like european size plates. These looked like what they serve in New York. Great for sharing though !",4,2018,05,06
245,"Good location, great breakfast, good service - but shuttle pickup glitch","We stayed here for a long layover before flying back to the USA.  Our experience was good apart from difficulty arranging shuttle pickup since our flight arrived after midnight (the shuttle stops running every 15 minutes after midnight and you have to call).  Make sure you are able to call if you arrive after midnight (our phone wasn't working internationally, and we had e-mailed this, but got the standard reply to call the hotel).  Fortunately, there were a number of buses around and one driver eventually called the hotel for us.",4,2018,05,06
245,Solid hotel Airport,"First time visiting Ireland for a vacation with my partner. Decided to stay in a hotel near the airport for the first night. 

The hotel is very conveniently located near the airport. It is about a 5 minute walk from terminal 2 or there is a free shuttle that comes around every 15 minutes or so. For an airport hotel this was a good stay. Friendly staff, clean room easily access to the airport. 

Would recommend.",4,2018,05,05
245,Clean and comfortable hotel,"Staying in Dublin for business I had a flight home on Saturday morning and was booked into the Radisson Blu hotel I was pleasantly surprised the rooms were very very spacious and well appointed, a great bathroom and walk in wardrobe.

We ate in the restaurant and I had the 12oz burger with fries it was very tasty and plentiful.

This is a great hotel, good bar and great restaurant, ideal for early morning travelling and with a shuttle every 15 mins to the airport 24 hours a day",4,2018,05,05
245,Over nighter ,"Had a late night return flight from Italy and decided to stay over rather arriving home during the night.Plus the trip had been to celebrate a special birthday & wanted to finish off the break on a high. But turned out we needed it to recover from the trip!!
(Check out my review of Grand Hotel Capodimonte)
Can not fault the actual hotel ; The Radisson group is everything & more. However the fact of a €160 room rate with no breakfast included is steep. 
Loved the room on the 5th floor but  a rate of €16.50 per person for breakfast as an extra is a joke. ",4,2018,05,03
245,"Very close to the airport, comfortable stay","We stayed here just for a night as we had an early morning flight to catch. Clean, comfortable and spacious room. Well located near the Dublin airport, they also have a free shuttle service to and from the Dublin airport which is a plus.",4,2018,05,03
245,Watch out for adjoining rooms,"We often stay at this hotel and always have a good experience with the staff who are very friendly and efficient.

On this occasion we were in one of the newly refurbished rooms which are  just great. Loving the new bathrooms. Where it all went wrong was in the allocation of a room with the option of the adjoining door to the next room for families. This door afforded us no sound proofing or light proofing, not sure that is a real phrase, but there was tonnes of light leaking from around the door. It was enough to keep me awake. This also meant the sound proofing was rubbish. Thankfully the person staying in the adjoining room was quiet BUT I could hear them eating their crisps!!!! It was a very disturbed nights sleep for us. Will be avoiding this set up in future. ",3,2018,04,24
245,Easy stop over,Ideal hotel for airport stopover . Walking distance from airport . Also courtesy bus if needed . Great links from airport in to the city . Cant fault it . Value for money . Great buffet breakfast . Excellent quality bed . ,5,2018,04,23
245,Good place to eat and stay!,"Fine dining and great staff. Breakfast was delicious and relatively cheap. If you are anywhere close by, do visit. Different types of cuisine and a lot of choice. Good Location, easy to get to. Can be really busy at times!",4,2018,04,18
245,Great staff and service,"wonderful room service from Austin and Vlasta and from the restaurant's Toya.  Smiles, friendliness and 
calm efficiency.  Check in man (didn't get his name)  also charming and accommodating. The hotel itself is a spotless and anodyne airport hotel but the people who work there made it very special.",4,2018,04,16
245,not good.,"Decided to book this hotel because it was near the airport and we had an early morning flight. We arrived late enough and the hotel was fully booked. The room was such a disappointment. It was a huge room with a small double bed that was so low to the floor. My husband asked was there a jack to go with it. The mattress was thin and not at all comfortable. we were in such a hurry the next morning and the guy on the dsk said just leave your key there, to be honest I should have complained but was tired and just wanted to get to the airport. Not a very good experience.",2,2018,04,16
245,Short stay,Nice hotel with with very friendly staff and wow what a breakfast tantastic. t3 bar food great too with speedy service always done with a smile close to the airport with a free shuttle service that was very good ,5,2018,04,15
245,Easter Sunday night,"I had an early flight on the Monday so a night at the airport was necessary. I always stay here when flying out of Dublin and it never disappoints. The rooms are very well appointed (coffee maker and great coffee selection!), spacious and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is a huge bar with lots of different seating options, and there is a very comfortable restaurant that welcomes single travelers and small groups alike. I am not necessarily a fan of this chain but I highly recommend this individual hotel. Also,their  shuttle service to the airport is great.",4,2018,04,13
245,A great turnaround,What a change in this hotel . I wasn't really impressed here before but after a refurb and a refurb of staff training as well it has all been upgraded . The rooms are comfy and the change in the breakfast set up is amazing . Well done,5,2018,04,12
245,Fine for overnight stay,"This hotel is a short walk to both terminals 1 and 2, which is a healthier way to start your day than a shuttle bus.

The staff were friendly. My “business” room was of decent size, tidy and clean but clearly not the newest. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom functional.

There was a good working desk with a nice Nespresso machine including a selection of cartridges. However, someone forgot to leave cups and there was no milk so my (nice) coffee was black in a glass!

I had a room at the back and high up that was quiet for me. I had a fairly early flight but as I was leaving the room at 6.30am I saw the bin men arriving at the waste area below. Firstly, this area should probably be a little more discrete without a view of a mountain of bin bags, and secondly the hotel probably shouldn’t allow a noisy collection at 6.30am!

Overall the hotel was fine for the rate I paid and I would happily stay again.",4,2018,04,12
245,"Outstanding service, Impeccable Accomodations","I stayed here for a week (for a business conference).  My room was comfortable and thoughtfully appointed -- with espresso machine, lots of bottled water, excellent shower, warm towels, etc, etc.  The service was outstanding -- responsive, thoughtful and flexible ... not only for me but for the conference I attended.  Great food available too.  An excellent athletic facility nearby.",5,2018,04,10
245,Pleasant overnight stay,"Great staff...friendly, happy, efficient. Snack and run breakfast (free) a great idea for those unable to have breakfast. Rooms are rather stark. Shuttle serviced to/from airport terminals was efficient and swift.",3,2018,04,10
245,Definitely recommend this hotel.  Easy free transfer to airport.  Lovely room great breakfast friendly staff. Would def,Absolutely loved this hotel made are overnight stay at Dublin airport very very easy.   Free fast transfer to airport.  Lovely room great free breakfast and free internet and printing in lobby for tickets     ,5,2018,04,03
245,Favourite Hotel at Dublin Airport,"I guess you always know what you are going to get at a Radisson Blue Hotel, and that is probably why I will always return. I have tried others in the area, but none have been able to compete.

On arrival at the hotel I was given a free upgrade to a business class room. It was spacious. Just a shame I was leaving early in the morning and did not have the opportunity to make the most of it.

The hotel offers on site parking, which costs in the region of €7.50/day. This is ok if convenience is high on your agenda, but it is slightly more expensive than the Airport's Red Car Park. 

The hotel is only a short walk from the terminals, or they run a complimentary bus service which departs from the hotel every 15 mins and runs 24 hours.

The hotel has a vibrant bar, and I enjoyed a nightcap before hitting my bed. There seemed to be plenty of staff, and service was quick and friendly.

There are renovations going on at the hotel at the moment, but this did not impact on my stay at all. I will certainly return next time I am flying early from Dublin.",4,2018,04,02
245,Great overnight stop,"Checked in late for overnight stay before early flight departure, good tidy room with tea and coffee facilities. Comfy sofa bed for our daughter and early morning call spot on time. Proximity to the airport was fabulous. Would recommend.",5,2018,04,01
245,Terrible customer service,"My husband stayed here over a week ago on a business trip. He booked in advance including parking and when he checked in he was told his rate did not include parking and they would have to add it on. My husband questioned this but was told 100% that the rate does not include parking. He proceeded to pay and when he checked his printed receipt sure enough there were two charges for parking. He went back reception (he still hadn't been to his room at this stage) and showed the girl the receipt. She apologized and admitted she had charged him twice. He was assured this would be refunded into his account. The next morning at checkout he queried it again and was told it had to be signed off by accounts. Someone called Sarah said it would take 7 days for this to be processed. Which is unacceptable when the hotel are at fault. Long story short over a week later, 4 different phone calls and two emails the refund has not been issued.
A further call today and was informed by Brendan that accounts still hadn't signed off on the refund and this can take up to 4 weeks...
My husband has had to chase people several times to get this resolved, phone calls haven't been returned and today we are no closet to getting the money back.
Whilst the actual amount is insignificant it's the principal of the matter and lack of good decent customer service that has driven me to this review. ",1,2018,03,29
245,Great rooms basic food," Room was great but cold. For diner the menu was very basic. I ordered vegan food. I assume there was no chef as they offered me a dry burger no sauce no bread no vegatables. It is a lovely dining area.

Only one of their staff was friendly or helpfull.

Any issues are seperate to the fact that they had a new computer system that did not work.

This could not pass as a 4star hotel.
",3,2018,03,27
245,Terrible ,"It took 25 minutes to check in! Room key didn’t work, another 10 minutes to sort that. Hammer drill going strong so no rest. Second time here in one month, very poor.
Prices typically exorbitant but service does not match.",2,2018,03,22
245,T.LC.,"Not that long ago airport hotels were, in the main, built to cater  for airline staff and some unfortunate passengers grounded by either  adverse weather conditions or aeroplane mechanical problems. They, for some, have ever been  deemed a necessary but unloved stopover spot for the fatigued business person, places to shower, recharge the battery and  allow the body recuperate from the stressful rigours of  long haul or complicated  flights. For the rest of us these hotels are the first night of a new adventure, the start of a much awaited break from routine and also  the first night of a new and exciting holiday.
There is now a new  and growing breed of airport hotels offering style and comfort to alleviate those long nights away from home and facilitate  a new experience. This hotel hits  almost all of these  buttons, reception is efficient and friendly, an upgrade, of course always sets the ball rolling positively. Amenities are spot on, rooms are spacious, the lobby area is user friendly and the early morning, west of Ireland, shuttle driver  was cheerful, knowledgeable and courteous, a real bonus at what for me was  a difficult task, i.e. being up and trying to function  at an unearthly hour in the morning.",4,2018,03,18
245,Day trip,Was down here for a business trip and conference. The hotel is situated right next to the airport which is very handy. The staff were all very nice to deal with. Lovely bathrooms and the restaurant was fantastic for lunch and breakfast. Didn’t stay for dinner so cannot comment on that. ,4,2018,03,17
245,They need to up their game with customer service,"I've been to this hotel twice for meetings. First time, service in the lounge was average and coffee was so hot I couldn't drink it for 10 minutes. Second time in a meeting room - reception staff quite rude and unhelpful when I asked about getting in to the room. I really would have expected an airport hotel which relies so heavily on room and meeting room business to have helpful staff on the front desk, delivering top quality customer service... but no.
Unlikely to chose this hotel next time",2,2018,03,16
245,Disappointing,"i expected more from Radisson Blu. Austere but clean room overlooking garbage cans. Badly laid-out bathroom. Room smelled of carpet cleaner. Dirty carpet in the hallways. Hotel is in need of a renovation. Went to eat in the restaurant, handed battered menu by waitress who then disappeared for 10 minutes - long enough for me to leave. Bar book ended by beer swilling drunks (locals). Restaurant smelled of old food, tattered chair. I decided to walk to the airport and eat there at a concession. Next time I'll stay across the street at the newly renovated Maldron. Ugh. Reception staff were friendly as was the minibus driver.",1,2018,03,12
245,An ageing hotel,"The staff was friendly, however, the rooms feel very old and worn. There is some renovation happening, and maybe this will improve the overall feel of the place. 

And... probably the worse breakfast I've ever had in a hotel.",2,2018,03,12
245,"Room good, friendly staff, terrible breakfast ","I've stayed here before and I think it's a good budget hotel close to the airport. This time, the room was absolutely fine, and quiet even though on the first floor.

But, breakfast was very poor and I'll book room only next time and eat elsewhere. ",3,2018,03,07
245,Under the circumstances,"My review is the one I did above. I thought it was the Radisson Blu review that I was doing. See above review.  Basically, don't extort people for profit. Remember these people were under huge stress of bad snow conditions and cancelled flights. The last thing they needed was to feel extorted by the Hotel which they would have seen as a refuge. You blew it basically.  If you had been less opportunistic you might have a won an an a army of committed Radisson Blu fans. The hotel itself was very very average  food wise and decor wise. Your staff were brilliant though. 10 out of 10 for them. They saved your bacon.   tA good experience under such adverse conditions is what would have been good for your profits in the future.I will never stay with a Radisson Hotel again. ",2,2018,03,04
245,Snow bound at the Airport,Great staff in challenging conditions - thank you 😊 the support of the collective team was welcome and offered without question. Great stay in unexpected situation. Still waiting to depart ...... thanks,5,2018,03,03
245,Okay for stay before a flight,"Rooms are okay but desperately need outlets or charging station next to bed. My room wasn't ready when I checked in, despite it being almost 3 pm. The reception staff did a nice job tracking me down when it did become available, although that took over an hour. Service in the restaurant was very good and the food was good quality, although not memorable. Shuttle service to airport was frequent and efficient.",4,2018,03,02
245,Relax before you fly,"Booked in here for the night before we went on holidays as we had a very early flight the next morning 
It was a Saturday  night and i have to say the price was not bad €99 per room 
staff nice and helpful
We had dinner here and i must say the  food is very good 
Wine still a bit expensive",4,2018,03,01
245,Absolutely perfect for an overnight to be near the Airport,"SPG: Platinum
Marriott: Gold
Melia: Silver

This overnight-1 night stay occurred in early December of 2017. I typically don't stray from Starwood or Melia, but with my ditching of Marriott I find myself trying brands I hadn't before, and Radisson Blu properties in particular I have come to like.

In two words: Simple, Comfort

This property is a mear 2 minute shuttle hop from the Terminals making it perfect, especially when your flight is at 6am. Having to leave Central Dublin for a 6am flight would mean you might as well just leave the bar and go straight on. I had to fly to Paris then JFK then to RSW so I needed rest and I was able to get a very nice 7 hours here.

The product is clear, comfortable, again simple, but it works great, and the food at every Blu I have stayed at now is top notch, and that goes for the staff as well.

Thank you to this staff for a wonderful stay and I will return

I would highly recommend this property, again, especially to better position yourself for an early departure from Dublin International.",5,2018,02,26
245,Great Convenient Hotel ,I have used the Raddison Dublin Airport on many occasions for business travel. Convenient to airport with good long term parking rates and reliable shuttle service. I highly recommend. Staff always seem to remember repeat guest names. Wonderful ,5,2018,02,26
245,Necessary evil,"Hotel is totally overpriced as is restaurant. Only reason anyone stays here is to make an early flight or if incoming flight is late. Avoid it if you can. Rooms are small, bathrooms in need of renovations and twice they failed to give wake up calls. Am reluctantly a regular user but only because of flight times. Restaurant expensive and food very average at best. Also endless loud tv on sports channels despite most people not being interested. Noisy bedrooms as people coming and going at different times. Shuttle bus to and fro the airport is random and particularly coming from the airport I've had to ring hotel more than twice to get bus to collect us-eventually-despite promises that buses are every 15mins! Not a good experience-EVER! ",1,2018,02,24
245,Misinformed,"The hotel itself is ok but is undergoing some works and they keep this very quiet when booking a room. However the drilling and banging right next door to your room will soon make you realise that you've made a mistake in booking here. Their partnership with ALSAA is also very misleading, the gym and pool have not been updated since the 80s and are verging on unusable (during my stay the boiler had broken and only cold showers were available). The staff seem to know little to nothing about these facilities either. The only restaurant that was open during my stay was T3 despite three options being listed on the website. Basically I was seriously underwhelmed from the second I walked in until I left. On the positive side, the transfer to the airport was painfree and the driver was very polite and professional. ",2,2018,02,23
245,Stop over for work,"I stopped here overnight for business and found the hotel to be very clean and the business class room was spacious.
There is a bar / restaurant which has very good food and drinks. The airport is a short walk from the hotel.",5,2018,02,23
245,Very  nice Hotel,"We stayed here on our way back from Teneriffe  in January , we arrived around 12 30 am , Check in was fast  and our room was really nice , its the closest to the airport and my first time to stay in it , we were very happy with everything , Free bus to airport",5,2018,02,12
245,Racing in Dublin,"On a one night trip to Dublin for horse racing sleeping close to the airport was a priority.  The Radisson Blu is right on the airport with a convenient shuttle bus every few minutes.  We had landed and cleared immigration by 9am and dropped into the hotel in the hope that we could leave our travel bag to save carting it around the race track all day.  To our surprise the receptionist said we could check in as the rooms were ready.  At nine am instead of after three pm.  I was gobsmacked.  Added to that we were offered a complimentary breakfast and free drink at the bar in the evening. I have never had hospitality like this anywhere in the world.
Every member of staff were going above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  The chamber staff called ''good morning'' as we passed along the corridors and the shuttle bus driver was a chatty friendly fellow.
The breakfast was OK and as expected but did lack a wow factor.  One slight criticism would be for the bathrooms.  While they contained great facilities the addition of a disposable razor and miniature tube of tooth paste would have been beneficial as they cannot be carried in hand luggage. Being so close to the airport there must be many customers on very short visits with hand luggage only.",4,2018,02,06
245,Very basic room,"For a hotel with the Radisson name, I was very surprised to get such a basic room. I was only staying a few hours due to an early flight the next morning, but it was stripped bare. The carpet and wooden furnishings have all seen better days. Bathroom was clean but in need of refurbishment. The check-in staff were very pleasant and I didn't use the dining facilities. I don't think I'd bother with this hotel again unless they upgrade the rooms.",2,2018,02,05
245,T3 Restaurant....,"Overnight night stay in Radisson Blu (Dublin Airport). Went down for a few drinks in T3 restaurant within hotel. Ended up ordering food, 8oz Burger/fries & Mussels/fries. Both meals were well presented & went down a treat :D 
Adding to the the bar staff (male, didn’t get his name), he was brilliant, so helpful, giving us both a professional/friendly service, so thank you to him. ",4,2018,02,05
245,before us,"very handy for catching flight to the us
room was very nice
dining in t3 was great
got great room rate
staff very friendly
had to come after being in us for 3 hours
and it was no problem
I will be back",5,2018,02,03
245,Not the best!,"Check in was smooth but Hotel it’s self’s not great I thought it had improved but regret not, room was basic, poor pillows, poor shower and a bad meal in the restaurant night before made it not a great stay.
Needed to stay right at the airport hence why I choose it.",3,2018,02,02
245,Advise on contact with hotel ,"Do not rely on email to ask about functions at this hotel. 
You will not get a reply even after 2 or more emails. 
I was attempting to book the room I had used last year for a function this year. 
I emailed mentioning I had been there previously and really enjoyed it and could I book the same room for this year. 
After emailing on 2 separate occasions still no word so I gave up. 
Yesterday and over 3 weeks after my 1st email I got a phone call asking if I still wanted to hook. 
I said thanks but no thanks. 
I was asked what venue I had booked which although i gave the info I thought was a bit intrusive. 
I was informed if I change my mind and want you book I could let them know. 
Come on,why would I do that when I have been looked after so well at the venue I booked. 
So folks maybe this venue hasn’t got a correct process in place for handling email queries. So maybe phone is best. 
It’s their loss. ",1,2018,01,31
245,Starting the holidays ,"Starting the holidays in the Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport to avoid the stress the following morning coming up all the way from Cork. Then doing the check-in, going through customs and the plane leaving at 2pm, made us decide the do this in no rush at all by staying here.",3,2018,01,30
245,Functional for air traveller,"Used this airport hotel for the most obvious reason of an airport hotel, that of needing overnight accommodation to facilitate an early morning flight. Hotel is within 5-10 mins walk from the two terminals at Dublin. If not encumbered by suitcases, then recommend walking rather than waiting for RB shuttle that gets crammed for early- departing  passengers.  Hotel reception is fast, even faster if you book online. Good value at c.45GBP/person for room (2 people) and breakfast. Business rooms are larger than standard room. - but both have adequate space for two. Well equipped with essential aids for a one-night traveller: safe, tea and coffee, towels and shower aids, TV and responsive wifi (included in room cost). Rooms clean and tidy. Seating somewhat rickety (room230), had to mend curtain tracks, and fought with a slow responding air-conditioning system (the latter seems to be a perennial issue with most medium grade hotels).  Dinner can be obtained in an in-house restaurant with standard but good range of plentiful dishes for westerner and non-western tastes. Breakfast (can be included in room cost) is available in separate area and is the usual range of hot and cold items standard for continental and/or Irish breakfasts. Only caveat is the unusual and non-functional implements for dispensing cold elements of the buffet!  Breakfast starts at 0630hr, earlier travellers can obtain coffee and buns at reception. Staff are responsive and supportive throughout the hotel. Overall for the traveller this is a good establishment to use - only one of two hotels within walking distance of terminals, and is recommended for one night, but could become limiting for anyone who thinks of using this hotel on a longer basis to visit Dublin.",4,2018,01,28
245,Airport hotel,"Stayed 1 night. Walking distance from terminal 2, if you know which way to walk ( 5 minutes ). If you walk out of terminal 2, turn right and go to the end of the building, there is a shuttle bus stop. Waited over 20 minutes ( the van probably just left before I got there, my luck ). No problem with check in, very friendly. Room was really spacious for airport hotel, happy. Breakfast buffet was great, really whatever you want. If you fly to terminal 1, kind of tricky to find shuttle bus stop. Anyway....good stay.",5,2018,01,24
245,Hard Work,"A few days here with work and it was my choice I'd go elsewhere. The hotel is hard work and the food leaves a lot to be desired.

Ask for an extended stay/late check out and your key automatically cancels at midday - more trips down to reception. This happened twice.

Food - cold breakfast when it should be hot ( and this when the restaurant had only just opened at 6:30am!!

Toastie in T3 bar all filler no killer. Don't resemble a melted cheese phenomenon at all. Avoid

Other restaurant was ok and friendly too",3,2018,01,22
245,Efficient airport hotel,This hotel is a typical airport 'stopover' hotel'.  It caters for very short stay guests and does so reasonably well.  The rooms are sufficient for short stays though they are on the small side.  There is a busy restaurant-bar in which the food and service is good.  The hotel operates a shuttle to and from the terminals ( 3-4 mins) and has complimentary coffee available early morning before the restaurant opens.,3,2018,01,22
245,Nice hotel located next to Terminal 2,"This hotel is centrally located next to the Dublin Airport Terminal 2. It is within walking distance and there is a free shuttle if you wish to take it. Staff was very friendly and the rooms were basic, but clean. Highly recommended for short layovers.",4,2018,01,19
245,Good place to stay before an early morning flight,"We had a warm welcome when we checked in, including acknowledgement of our club membership, resulting in a free dessert voucher, which was a nice surprise. There's a free shuttle to the airport, which is very handy. The room was serviceable, and had everything we needed. Bit of a downer when we went down for dinner to use the voucher we'd been given, but that's more of a restaurant problem than with the hotel itself. Would definitely stay here again if passing through Dublin airport.",4,2018,01,18
245,Great stay!,"We stayed here the night before our flight. I will certainly be doing this again. The hotel is nice. The rooms are a bit dated, but they're fine. The bed is comfortable, and the bathroom has a bathtub. The room also has a mini fridge, safe, and bathrobes. 
This hotel has a restaurant, and it's very nice. If you are traveling with kids, they eat free! Our daughter got a main, two sides, and a dessert! My husband and I both got the €20 set menu, and we loved it. I say this because we didn't have our car any longer, and it was very nice to have a restaurant right there.
The shuttle runs every 15 minutes to and from the airport. It's about the size of a van (I think it seats around 7). It's incredibly convenient. 
We left too early for breakfast, but they do set some things out for those traveling early. They have nutrigrain bars of different flavors, water, tea, coffee, and fruit. I thought this was such a nice touch!
Overall, we will definitely be staying here again. It made our flight SO much easier and relaxing.",5,2018,01,16
245,Just ok,"Stayed at hotel only 1 night. Very warm on check in, where there on check out very rude receptionist didnt even ask me how was your stay, he didnt ask nothing. Service in the restaurant very slow and food wasnt great, maybe i just pick wrong dish. After dinner went back to the restaurant from the room to buy one bottle of beer, woman in the restaurant again very rude, ask her how much and her answer was ,, i dont know just give me the money !'' Some of the hotel staff need lessons of good manners.",3,2018,01,16
245,Not a Radisson standard hotel,"Hi
Ok ..it’s close to airport 15min shuttle and friendly shuttle service .
The hotel reception welcome was ...lacking ...much more interested in filling out forms etc that connecting with you the customer .i know they are busy but ...
The room was very disappointing,not at all what you might expect for a Radissson ...poorly furnished ,worn and tired carpets ,Small TV & lead training along wall .A practical table & 5 chairs more suitable to a canteen .
Bathroom very basic and again worn & tired .

Overall very poor value for money and surviving on its location .",2,2018,01,16
245,Dublin airport,"Stayed at this hotel 27 December hotel advertised airport shuttle every 15 mins
we waited over 40 minutes in the freezing cold rooms are basic stayed at the
maldron before much better value would not return",2,2018,01,15
245,Literally next to Terminal 2,"Beautiful Hotel, contemporary with a lovely hint of nostalgia via the old photos hanging throughout the hotel. The business class rooms are fabulous. Large and well furnished. The beds are amazing with the most comfortable mattress topper I have ever slept on. Large waterfall shower and great seating area. Although the hotel is only an 8 minute walk to Terminal 1 (less to terminal 2) there was no noise at all. Staff are very helpful and there is a complimentary grab and go breakfast for early risers up to 6:30 am. The bar had a lovely atmosphere and there was an early bird option in the restaurant which was great value.",5,2018,01,14
245,Good airport hotel and convenient to airport ,"Have used the Radisson many times. When you have an early morning flight, this is a perfect location. Weather permitting, this is a short walk to Terminal 2. However, you can always take the courtesy bus. Car parking is secure and very close to the airport. 
For early morning flights, the demand for the bus can be significant and it’s on a first come first serve basis. You might have to wait for the next bus 20-30mins later, if you don’t get on board first time! Forward planning pays off!!
The quality of the room furnishings is good. Beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are usually to a good standard. There can be variations in the quality of the shower unit (pressure variations). 
The buffet breakfast is excellent. Front desk staff are efficient. This is my hotel of choice especially when I have an early morning flight. ",4,2018,01,13
245,Overnight Stay,"Having read some of the previous poor reviews regarding the T3 restaurant at the hotel my husband & I were a little dubious however we have just had a two course meal for €20 per person, it was the early bird special which is available until 7pm.  The food was absolutely delicious, hot and tasty and considering it is an airport hotel we thought it was good value for money. We both started with the fish cake followed by Guinness and Leek sausage served with mash and in my case rosemary and garlic chicken.  Lovely polite and friendly staff especially Rakib. ",4,2018,01,12
245,Best airport option,"When having a long-haul flight scheduled for the morning, staying in one of the airport hotels is really the best option. Hotel prices in & around Dublin are astronomical & this time around the Radisson came in with the best rate.
The room was large, clean & quiet, the bed comfortable with fresh, crisp linen.
The shuttle service runs continuously, just be aware, to catch the shuttle from the terminal to the hotel, the stop is not where the other pick-ups are in area 13 past the church, but just outside the multi storey car park where the busses from the red & the blue long term car parks stop to pick up passengers. 
Breakfast is exactly what you expect from the Radisson, everything is available, from a a hearty full Irish to fresh fruit & cereals. Coffee is good.
Staff is pleasant & helpful throughout.",4,2018,01,10
245,Great Airport Option,"Owing to a flight cancellation we (2 adults, two kids - aged 7 and 9) had to overnight in the hotel at the last minute.  Staff were lovely and helpful straight away.  From reception to housekeeping, to the bar, to the shuttle bus driver (at 5am - full of smiles and could not have been more helpful) the staff were exceptional.  They put together a late feed for us and really made what could have been a difficult night very easy.  Room was very good. Bar nice and relaxing.  Could not fault the place.  Thanks guys.",5,2018,01,07
245,Above average,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night before a flight to the states. Very convenient for the airport, just a short 5 minute walk on designated paths from terminal 2. 
I had a room on the 4th floor looking over towards the airport. I could hear the planes but it didn’t bother me too much and they stopped through the night. 
Comfortable bed with all amenities including a nespresso machine, although I didn’t use it, much prefer a cup of tea!
Was looking forward to a bath but the room had a large shower instead, it was a nice rain shower but I couldn’t get over my disappointment of wanting a bath. 
Overall a good experience.",4,2018,01,06
245,Perfect airport stay over,"I always find the location, service and facilities perfect for pre long haul trips. A two minute shuttle to either terminal and polite professional team makes this hotel the only one I would consider at Dublin airport. No need to check out their competitors ",5,2018,01,05
245,Excellent stay,I had an early flight the next morning. And the proximity of the hotel to the terminal was important to me. The food downstairs in the Departures Lounge was good and the fact they had breakfast to g made it more amenable.,5,2017,12,30
245,"Hassle-free, Ideal Stopover for Dublin International Airport","Have used this hotel several times now over the past three years. It is located very close to the airport and, despite the free shuttle bus service, is within easy walking distance of the terminal buildings.

The welcome at reception are always been warm and friendly. Check-in is swift and efficient and if you pre-book parking at the hotel, you will recieve an exit car park pass for when you arrive back from your trip.

The rooms are reasonable is size and layout is typical of what you might expect. The main room has double bed, desk to work at and enough space for your luggage or light exercise or yoga. The bath is adjacent to the entry door and has shower/Bath combined. 

Normally, the shower has been fine with the exception of this trip where it went hot and cold during my shower.

The bed is comfortable, but only one pillow and no spares in the cupboard - I am sure that another set is available upon request. 

The restaurant is a good size with plenty of seating. There is a good selection of food and is reasonably priced considering it is an airport hotel. The Guinness (as I would expect) is served to perfection, smooth and creamy.

All the food that I have eaten here has been very good. I can vouch for the burgers, fish and chips, salads and the pizza - All very good with a pint of Guinness :-)

If you plan to use the free shuttle bus service, then allow at least 15 - 20 minutes. They are two buses alternating, but you might have to wait for the next bus. The ride to the terminals is no more than 5 minutes. If you decide to walk, then there is a footpath that takes across a busy junction (with lights) and onto the terminal - Maximum 15 minutes on foot.

In terms of cost and value for money - That depends on the hassle factor. It is possible to find a cheaper stoppover and park in the long stay car parks, most flights that I have taken have been very early morning. In this case, staying and the Radisson and using their parking facility is a little more expensive, but virtually hassle-free. Once, parked and checked in, you just only have to get up and go - couldn’t be simpler!

For those early flyers, there is usually complimentary fresh fruit, cereal bars, tea and coffee in the main reception.

The thing I really like about this hotel is the quality of the staff. They are all very friendly, polite and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble. They are well trained and knowledgable.",4,2017,12,30
245,Walking distance to Dublin Airport,"After a long haul flight, I decided to stay at Dublin Airport for a good nights sleep. Radisson Blu was so close it was the perfect choice. 

The front staff we very friendly, checkin was swift and within a few minutes I was up in my suite (free upgrade to business room which give you a great view of the airport and the planes coming and going)

First thing I did was ordered room service with the lovely Gary. Tea and toast promptly arrived. 

The hotel is a little dated and could do with a cosmetic upgrade but as I said it was close to the airport, the room was spotless, the bed was really comfortable, there was no noise from the outside traffic or planes and at $107 Euro for the night, including a full breakfast and newspaper, it was excellent value. 

Check out was equally as smooth and if requested there is a 2pm check out ( not sure if an additional fee applies). 

If your looking for an overnight stay close to Dublin Airport, give this a try 🇮🇪",4,2017,12,22
245,As expected ,"Had a recent visit here, it is as expected an airport hotel. Staff are friendly and courteous, there is easy access to the airport by shuttle bus, room are pleasant and good food. Definitely does the job!",4,2017,12,16
245,"Change of travel arrangements, meant we had to book into a hotel at Dublin Airport","Excellent stay, lovely clean well serviced hotel with great staff and great facilities.  Good restaurants, and very very handy to the airport in Dublin.  Shuttle bus provided also. Selective menu, well stocked bar with a  relax atmosphere. ",4,2017,12,16
245,Could really do with an update...,"Stayed here before flight, reception and most areas downstairs are ok, but the rooms need to be updated, as not up to the usual Radisson standard you find in Ireland. Also, would really benefit from better noise insulation on airport facing rooms, as can be a bit noisy with the road and aircraft taking off.",3,2017,12,13
245,Sinking Toilet,Very unnerving to sit on a Toilet and you feel it give in to your weight. This should be addressed. It felt like you would slip through the floor at any moment. The deco of the bathrooms is also needing a reveiw. The taps and tub are so dated ,4,2017,12,13
245,Nice stay before a really early flight,"I stayed for one night in this hotel before a really early flight. The room was really quiet and cozy, but the heating was not working perfectly since the room could have been bit warmer. Breakfast includes a broad variety of pastry and hot dishes choices.",4,2017,12,09
245,Does not meet expectations,"We had a horrible time at this hotel. 

Some of the staff were rude.  Maybe ""rude"" is not the word.  They were abrupt and indifferent. 

They advertise access to a leisure centre as part of your stay. Whilst they do mention that thiscentre is a short walk away, they don´t mention that it is safer to actually take a mini bus to reach it.  Otherwise, you face crossing the major, busy entrance to Dublins International Aiport. They do not say either  that the leisure centre looks and feels like a very dated and dirty YMCA from the 1960s and that the centre has many many many rules you need to meet before you are allowed in.  

When booking make sure you do it directly through their website and print what you requested. In our case, we requested a room with 2 beds. They claim we didn´t and instead we got a bed and sofa bed with the most uncomfortable, cheapest mattress they could find.  

Avoid if you can.",1,2017,12,09
245,Not up to the Radisson standard,"I only stayed one night having arrived into Dublin airport late at night and had booked in so I could sleep before driving the 4 hours home to the north west. 

I have stayed in various Radisson hotels over the years and they have always been of a high standard so I was expecting a certain standard from the brand. But I was disappointed. The room is quite old and getting run down, especially the bathroom. Not the quality I was expecting at all. 

The bed was comfortable though and despite being right next to the airport, the windows were fairly sound proofed so I didn't hear any flight noises and I had a good night sleep. 

It is very conveniently located next to the airport and I phoned the hotel and they came to pick me up from the airport. 
Staff seemed nice. I didn't have much dealings with them apart from check-in and check-out and airport pick-up.

I don't think I'd stay here again, not at the price they are asking for a run down hotel.

I'm told they are doing renovations since I stayed so hopefully the hotel will be in better condition and I will consider staying again.",3,2017,12,08
245,Nice staff,"Expected something different for an airport hotel... rooms are ok not what you expect of Radisson! The restaurant is oddly shaped, so either you sitting in a corner hidden or in a booth with loads of open space. Food was great though! Only saw one waitress running around between 8 tables. Told to leave bar area at 11 (still had drinks on our table) and move to lobby even though bar area had 4 tables of people. We said if the others move so will we, no one moved and everyone finished their drinks.
The hotel had some renovations going on, so they upgraded our rooms. Staff is really nice. Special mention to Paul the shuttle driver, he is amazing and friendly... was really nice with the kids and helped us at the airport! ",3,2017,12,06
245,Great location and excellent staff,"After having some issues at another location wanted to give Radisson Blu another chance.  Exchanged some emails with reservation staff, Silvia answered all my questions and helped book for meetings in Dublin. 
Great location very close to the airport with 24 hour shuttle service makes it a very convenient hotel for travellers but it is not your average airport hotel.    Check in was a breeze with very pleasant and attentive staff. Room was large, very well appointed and spotless.  Great bed and linen with a desk and a separate table for working.  
Breakfast buffet was great with something for everyone offered  and the quality of the food and attention to detail was obvious. 
Dinner in T3 both nights was very good and the server Nina gets full marks for enthusiasm and making sure her tables looked after; bubbly and outgoing she goes the extra mile to ensure a great dining experience, 
Being close to the holidays staff were busy with beautiful decorations and a huge Christmas tree in the lobby- fantastic. 
I had the opportunity to speak to Elaine the GM and thank her for running a great hotel with wonderful staff and it was clear from my discussion that her enthusiasm and professionalism is shared by all.  I will definitely  return!",5,2017,12,01
245,Flying from Dublin Airport made easier....,"This hotel had friendly staff with quick check-in, spotless rooms, with good room service and a wonderful (for a cost) buffet breakfast.  There was a free and very quick shuttle to the terminals, making this a perfect stop for the night before a flight.",5,2017,11,29
245,Reasonable hotel close to airport,"On Radisson you get what you expect, which is good.
This hotel was going through some renovations which was needed at some areas.
But in general good although I have been at better Radisson hotels.
Spacious and nice areas and restaurants.
Good sized rooms.",3,2017,11,28
245,Free Latte from Pedro T3 Restaurant - Thank you!,"After a long business trip and dealing with cancelled flights, I finally made it back to Dublin to stay at the Radisson for a one night stay last Thursday night.

I have to say I experienced an amazing gesture where I was purchasing a Latte for the drive home to Kerry.]
I went to pay for the Latte and Pedro said no, this is your free coffee for Black Friday.]
It was such a kind gesture, that I was totally surprised.

I would really recommend this hotel and would stay there again.

Thank you Pedro for your kind gesture and for making my day!

Kind regards
Simonette",4,2017,11,27
245,Great Hotel and kid friendly,"Spent a friday night with my two kids as we were flying out of the airport early the next day. Room was fine for us, 1 adult and 2 secen year old boys. Everything very clean. Good choice of TV programmes. We ate in the bard, the Radisson do a great  kids can eat free under 12 year old. Food is simple for the kids but they like it ",5,2017,11,27
245,Location is good and nice staff.,"The hotel is located 6 min something on foot from the airport so it's easy and also convenient to visit city by bus etc. The hotel shuttle sounded good but it didn't work for me. I waited for 15 min and nothing happened and called the hotel, the reception guy said he would send it right away but nothing happened within another 15 min and I walked to the hotel. And they forgot the welcome gift which I was supposed to get it as a my membership. But it's ok, I will go back the hotel and also recommend it strongly. The brakfast was nice and it's a pity for me I couldn't use their nice souna, spa and gym because of my tight schedule. Next time I will use those facilities. The house keeping cleaned my room very well and the reception upgraded my room. They are very polite and humble. Thanks again.",5,2017,11,24
245,Very comfortable ,"This was the last hotel we stayed at during our 3 week trip to London & Ireland and it was by far the best of the hotels we stayed at in Ireland. The bed was comfortable, shower had good pressure, climate conttol in the room worked well plus they provided all the toiletries you would expect, including face washers (which surprisingly several other hotels didn't). 
All in all it was a comfortable stay before our early morning flight the next day and I would definitely stay again. ",4,2017,11,22
245,Horrible !,"This was the shabbiest hotel we have ever been in.  Very old and broken down furniture, horrible bed, the very non user friendly shower, non responsive front desk staff, sad breakfast buffet and in much need of updating and redecorating.",1,2017,11,21
245,Captive audience...,"Needing a bed for a few hours in advance of an early morning flight I booked accommodation here. My stay got off to a bad start when the reception staff seemed very uninterested in making me feel welcome - I appeared to be an inconvenience to their need to huddle and gossip. 
The room assigned to me was basic and in much need of updating....
One positive point was that the manager in the restaurant was most pleasant and made me very feel very welcome for dinner.
I couldn't believe that I had to pay for the overnight car park when I was a resident. 
When leaving early morning (4am) the coffee and fresh fruit was a pleasant surprise.
Overall: the place was too expensive for what it offered",3,2017,11,20
245,Overnighter,"What’s to say, convenient ... a short walk from the terminal, good bed, reasonable food not mega expensive.....will stay here again on my next stop over..food in the restaurant was OK, also they were showing the rugby so very pleased.....",4,2017,11,19
245,Very convenient for airport,"Good staff, approachable & helpful. The highlight - thank you. 

Food in the bar was very tasty - recommend the lamb. Bar staff are really good too - attentive & friendly. 

Good size room & space to work properly (desk etc). Free wifi works very well - pretty quick & allows you to stream if needed. Comfy bed. 

Room was a little 'dated' ... just could do with a bit of a lift. 

The pool / gym are off site & guidance/info as to where they are is like a secret. A map would be beneficial albeit I think they may be airing on the health and safety side in terms of getting there. Eventually got to the gym via the shuttle service & it was a good start to the morning. As I say, a map of where the things are & times when the pool can be used would be beneficial for those of us who want to use them facilities - they are important to some travellers who are on business trips. 

These are minor points. Overall - a good stopover & would certainly use again if able/offered. Convenience for the airport is key.",4,2017,11,07
245,Overnight stop,"We only stayed overnight but found the room and service to be excellent. As an airport hotel it provided all that was needed and with our early morning flight it was a nice touch to have bottled water ,fruit etc available before our departure.",4,2017,11,03
245,"Nice hotel, great service","We stayed in an Executive Suite and was very happy.  I read other reviews about the hotel needing a reno, I am not sure if the entire hotel was renovated, but our room was obviously recently done.  Modern decor and well appointed.  The service was excellent, with the exception of a single shuttle driver.  Everyone was willing to go above and beyond.  Very accommodating and even managed to help with some off book requests.  The executive suite is spacious and perfect if you are with a group and need to hold a small gathering or meeting in your room.  Lots of space with a half bath for guests.  Keeps your bedroom and personal space, personal.

Breakfast was well done, lots to offer you will not leave hungry.  Peak times did see a small wait to be seated, but overall it moved quickly.  More importantly it was replenished and well-stocked even during busy rushes.

Vincent in reservations was exceptional and should be commended for his help with out group.  Definitely went above and beyond for us.  

Book this hotel, you will not be disappointed.",5,2017,10,19
245,Convenient Choice,"This property is very close to airport and the shuttle service convenient.  Rooms are comfortable and staff is friendly and accomodating.  When we requested a room change to accomodate a special need, there was no difficulty in doing so.  ",4,2017,10,19
245,easy and best access to dublin airport,"quality sleep excellent. very good food. room furnishing some spartan and cold, reminded me of my college dormitory but clean.   large room. excellent room temperature control which is unusual in many hotels throughout europe. easy access to city center.  friendly helpful staff. would not hesitate to stay here again. ",4,2017,10,16
245,rooms need some attention,"Rooms really need to be redecorated. We stayed in a junior suite ( it was vert spacious) but it seems like the room has not refreshed/maintained since the hotel was built. The furniture (tables & cupboards) are badly chipped scrapped. 

On the plus side it is Ideally located for the airport with a free shuttle bus going to t1 & t2 that takes less than 5 minutes. 

I would not be recommending this hotel, there are better options around the airport for the price. Would really expect more for the price (even from an airport hotel)",2,2017,10,12
245,"Dated, drab and depressing","I have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions over the last 5 years and each time it just seems to get worse and worse. My room this week was so drab and dated that after a long flight and the need to feel relaxed it was just depressing to walk into. The bathroom was a lesson in contortion as one had to try to get into the shower without hitting the sink and the toilet was behind the door so that you have to again try and work your way around. Given the high price that was paid this was most definitely not a 4 star hotel. What has happened to this brand, once the example of quality that they now simply just want to process people in and out like an overpriced hostel. They are in my view abusing their proximity to the airport and can charge any price but I definitely will not be going back, I have had enough.",2,2017,10,11
245,Never again!,"Stayed at this hotel the night before an event. 
What an awful experience - left the hotel totally stressed - never again! 
Very expensive for what they offer. 
No hot water in the bathroom. 
No ""free parking"" for residents. Just a pure money making machine. 
For a so-called international hotel their choice of non-caffeinated teas was diabolical.",1,2017,10,11
245,Excellent hotel right at Dublin Airport - was perfect for our last night in Ireland,"As with many guests at this hotel we were there just for one night, the night prior to our morning return flight to the U.S.  The location is great, right at the airport between the rental car agencies and the terminals, both just a 5-minute ride away.    We parked for 15 minutes and checked in Friday afternoon, then returned our car, and Sixt Car Rental gave us a personal lift right back to your hotel in the car we were turning in.  Can't beat that!  The car agencies are only about a 15-minute walk to this hotel for those so inclined to walk.

Hotel heck-in was real smooth, easy, friendly and efficient.  Our room (126) was nicely furnished, and although on the smaller side, was comfortable for a short stay, and we really liked that it had a sofa in it, too, for relaxing on.  The bar and restaurant staff were friendly, and the facilities are very nice.  A business-like atmosphere.  We made a mistake and saw the Keady's Restaurant a short walk away and we went there for an early dinner because it looked a little more ""Irish"" than the Radisson for the last night of our visit to Ireland, but it was disappointing and we wished we had stayed and had dinner at your hotel.  But, we did each get a drink and dessert (excellent desserts!), and that was the perfect last bite and drink we had on our vacation.  The morning wake-up call came thru as promised, and the hotel's van service to the terminals that runs every 15 minutes is great, and our driver was very friendly and helpful.  

All in all, our one-night at Radisson Blue Hotel Dublin Airport was an excellent stay and we recommend this hotel to others, and we will stay again on our next (8th) trip to Ireland.  Thanks!",5,2017,10,10
245,Good Location but Quite Overpriced for what it offers,"Most staff was professional, especially the Irish young lady at reception, and the foreign waiters at the restaurant. It is great to have car park. Room was clean and comfortable. Easy access to hotel to and from airport.

The bathroom seriously needs upgrading. The bath, especially, is not deep enough to immerse your whole body, and the tap is actually rusty and there were rust debris everywhere - I had to clean it all up and run the water a few times until finally the amount of rust subsided - this would be ok if I had not paid over 200 euro for my whole stay. The room was cold. To heat it, you need to use the air conditioning. I prefer normal central heating. There was no plug to charge my smartphone near the bed. During the night, there was a noise that kept me awake. It was like the noise of a bus running outside. I can only think it must have been the air conditioning, but mine was actually off! Pity the car parking was so expensive for just one night! I hesitated between staying here or at the Clayton, ending up staying here because it was so near the airport, but I must say that, if I can choose again, I will stay at the Clayton, where I often have stayed and am always happy, plus it is never as expensive as here. In my opinion, the Radisson really needs to rethink their prices.",3,2017,10,09
245,Wow - that's customer service! Take a bow!,"Hotels are expensive in Ireland, as you know! Seeing a great rate on the Radisson's website, I booked - and then saw that I was in the wrong city! I meant to book the sister hotel in Belfast. When I noticed the error and began madly calling Radisson's help lines in the U.S., London and Ireland, their customer service agents couldn't help. ""You can't cancel."" ""You forfeit the entire amount.""
That was til I got a number for the Radisson Blu in Dublin and called the manager directly. He promised to look into it. I must admit I was a bit skeptical that anything would be resolved.
Low and behold, I got a lovely call back from Mabel who said she was happy to report they would cancel the booking for an honest mistake - saving me 351 Euros!
Vincent Bonar, the reservations supervisor, followed up with an email. Take a bow Radisson Blu!
You get a 10 out of 10 for customer responsiveness. And yes, I'm staying at a Radisson tonight!
- Sleeping easy in Belfast",5,2017,10,06
245,Quick Stop!,Stayed over on route to Lanzarote last week! Excellent service from arrival at the front desk to the shuttle to T1 at 4.30am the next morning. Fantastic views of Dublin from the 5th floor. Great bar food at reasonable prices and very pleasant staff all round. Really enjoyed it! Closest hotel to terminals too.,5,2017,10,04
245,OVER PRICED!,"Disappointed and unlikely to stay at this hotel again.  Purely based on price and lack of a bath in my room.  On the plus side it is well situated for the airport, clean and modern but too expensive for me.",3,2017,10,03
245,A review of an old friend,"Its been a long time since I last reviewed the Dublin Airport Radisson Blu so here goes with my update.

First the good points

Friendly, prompt and efficient check in/out.
A nice ""Junior suite"" but not actually a suite - rather a large, clean and airy room - see room plan and photograph.
A nice gown and slippers for two. A good coffee and tea making kit.
A top rate air-con system.
Fast and free wireless internet.
The mini-bar fridge was not filled but it was working - this is good - the fridges in this hotel never used to work properly.
An excellent gastro pub (T3) one of our favourites for both fast-ish food and drink.

Now the bad points.

Booking on their own App is a problem. Booking.com easily beats their internet price on occasions.
The spoons and cups in the room were not washed properly.
No envelopes and stationery were provided like they used to be.
No bathroom face flannels provided like they used to and no shower cap except on request.
One tiny bar of soap for two people using basin AND bath/shower.

I'm afraid standards are slipping just a bit - lets see how we get on during our next stay at this airport hotel. 

",4,2017,10,02
245,1 night only,"If you're flying into Dublin late this place will be fine for a night but nothing more. The shuttle driver to and from the airport was hilarious and very friendly. The room itself was ok but nothing special, although thankfully it was quiet. The bed was comfortable and it was clean but the bathroom was poor. The shower is baffling too. Breakfast was excellent, after being on the continent for a while it was nice to have a proper breakfast again. The biggest problem for us was that we were woken up at 08:30am by the cleaner trying to enter our room! Why on earth our room would even be on the cleaning rota for a 1 night stay when we haven't checked out yet I don't know but this was incredibly off-putting no matter how many times the lady apologised through the door. If you see this hotel on a deal like we did it's fine for a night but beware unexpected cleaning in the morning!",3,2017,10,01
245,Won't return to this hotel,"The room was not clean. Outside the room were working conditions or some other stuff and the noise was VERY loud. The room we were given was for the disable people (i don't know why) and so the shower wasn't very comfortable to use... just floor and a curtain. But we were SO tired with our journey that had no power to go and argue with reception.
Nobody ask for our room number at the breakfast. So why should we pay for it if everyone can have a meal for free?!
the cups on the table was dirty. Nobody offered tea or coffee for us. So I had to prepare coffee in a machine where I should  use cardboard cup..
It definitely doesn't cost the money they ask..",1,2017,09,29
245,Over priced for a poor hotel,"Stayed at this hotel as it was close to the airport and I landed late, the hotel charged 200 Euro a night for a room that was dirty, toilet that did not flush, a shower that needed an engineering degree to figure out how to turn on and off the water and the way the water came out and cover the bathroom would explain the horrible musty/ moldy smell when you walk in to the bathroom, the public areas are old and need an upgrade not sure I will stay there again if I can avoid",2,2017,09,28
245,Not great,The room and corridors were dated and in need of paint. We booked a family room but got a double with a sofa bed which was simply terrible and couldn't be slept on. Not worth the price paid. The reception staff were friendly and professional though. ,2,2017,09,26
245,Not great value for money,"I have stayed in the hotel Saturday/Sunday night last weekend (room 505), I could not stop being surprised hot they can charge over £150 for a room that wasn't well hoovered, that may have coffee machine but well, no cup, no sugar, no tea, no spoon (as some people  may not like coffee). There was a mini bar with just 2 bottles of still water, so if you want a drink- go downstairs to the bar and get it yourself or for the money you have paid for this very average looking room with cheap furniture you can pay another £15 for room service. Ahh and yes, if you come by car, pay another £7.50 per night for parking. The bathroom wasn't impressive either, the tap, bath and shower were stained with brown patches, I was impressed they haven't forgot to give some shower gel, shampoo! Well done for that, you even got some body lotion which was nice touch. But then again the towels (no matter how nice folded) didn't smell that nice and fresh at all. And yes it was very noisy but not only with pains but music!!! The reason I have chosen this hotel was because it was close to the airport and I didn't want to miss my flight and also I though Radisson Blue is a great hotel- well it's not... lost money really",2,2017,09,25
245,Very convenient to airport with good dinner food.,Very clean and quite quiet for sleeping despite being next door to the airport. We had dinner twice at the hotel and the food was well prepared and tasty. Breakfast was a buffet and is average but acceptable.  We had a day to tour Dublin after checking into the hotel and returning our rental car the night before. We simply hopped the hotel shuttle to the airport and then boarded the airport express bus to Dublin city center.,5,2017,09,19
245,Feeling Blue: Business Class more like Cattle Class,"Stayed because I didn't want to miss a morning flight to the US, its cheaper from Dublin.
An inferior hotel without any Irish Charm or even Irish Staff. As I arrived at reception, the lady looked at my ID and then disappeared. I moved to a guy further down the counter and ten minutes managed to check in. The lady supervisor apologised for the rudeness and delay.
Room old with small TV, cheap bathroom and no mini bar. Travel Lodge style for 200 Euros per night
Since no mini bar I called room service five times, no answer, so-called zero and got the fantastic front desk. They switched me through to room service, one large sparkling water with Ice and Lemon please. 30 minutes later, you guessed nothing!
Called again, room service still busy and called the front desk, they put me through to room service: Ah yes sir your sparkling water, forget it please cancel.
So many poor reviews tell you something: it's an airport rip off hotel.
The door to the room says business class but the room says cattle class",1,2017,09,17
245,On airport property convenient shuttle,"Its a decent hotel with a convenient shuttle right in the airport complex. THe restaurant is good. Stayed a night in the executive room, but felt it was large but not very well furnished. Old and dinged furniture. The bathroom fittings are also in need of replacement.
Staff could be friendlier at both checkin and checkout - not rude or anything, but just didnt feel very welcome.
I like the fact that in the morning they have cereal bars, fruits and water for those taking an early morning flight.",3,2017,09,16
245,Good stay second time around,"Stayed here last week for just 1 night due to an early flight the next morning. 
Beautiful hotel, good service and we were upgraded to a business class room (#446 I believe) which was quite big and very comfortable. Free wifi worked well and we also enjoyed their bar for a drink or two. The location of the hotel is great, so close to the airport that, if without much luggage, you can actually walk to Terminal 1 in 5-10 minutes tops (hubby did that when returning the rental car - it was quicker to walk from the terminal and skip the shuttle). I’m glad to report that the free shuttle in the morning was working way better than the last time we stayed here - two shuttles running every 15 minutes which meant no queuing for the shuttle. The one small “complaint” is that they only allow 20 minute free parking, after that there’s charges to park. We had to rush to check in and get all our bags into the room before driving away to return the rental at the airport. 
Altogether a good stay and I would return if the rate was good.",4,2017,09,15
245,Average hotel very close to airport,"The hotel is very close to the airport, only a 5-10min walk from the terminal. This is the main advantage of the hotel. The rooms are ok, furniture was quite tired with closet doors very worn and not properly closing, etc. bed was good. Breakfast is average at best. Some options there but the warm food was not very tasty or fresh.
",3,2017,09,13
245,quick access to airport with free shuttle,"Great hotel to stay at if you want to be close to the airport. We also got a free shuttle to the airport at 4:30am for our flight. Room stay was good. They had a continental breakfast in the wee hours of the morning, so that was really helpful.",4,2017,09,11
245,Comfy hotel across from the airport ,"A 10 minute walk from dublin airport, this hotel is very handy for an early start flight. Very comfy beds and spacious rooms. Friendly staff at the reception check in. The feeder bus to the airport terminal is handy if you have luggage. ",4,2017,09,09
245,Good hotel with great access to Dublin airport,"Chose this hotel because of its great access to Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport and that it offered preferential parking rates to hotel guests who wanted to stay a night, park and fly. You can walk to the terminal from the hotel if travelling light in less than 10 minutes - which we did when flying back into Dublin, saving time on waiting for the courtesy bus to pick us up when we were picking up our car. In regard to our stay at the Radisson Blu I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. Front desk staff where welcoming and helpful and the buisness room we booked was spacious and quiet. We ate breakfast in the hotel at around 8.30am, by which time the restuarant was quite empty as many guests had already checked out to catch morning flights to the States.",4,2017,09,05
245,Location!,"The location can't be beat. Free shuttle every 15 minutes to the airport which is minutes away. The room was smallish but the bathroom was a good size. The room was clean and quiet, just what we needed before our long journey home.",4,2017,09,02
245,Needs Upgrading,"The service here is horrible, in the restaurant, the bar and the airport shuttle.  We waited an hour for the shuttle to pick us up at the airport.  The shuttle went by us and another couple that was waiting for it twice!  There was room but he just went by.  The rooms need to be upgraded.",2,2017,09,01
245,Bar menu food,"Chose from the very poor bar menu during a short business lunch. The turkey club ciabatta, when it eventually arrived was small, tasteless and a waste of money at 9.50 euro. 
While airport terminals in general are known for questionable value, on this occasion the 800m walk would be better for both choice and value. 

",2,2017,08,31
245,Great hotel,"Very friendly staff and a lovely hotel. Would definitely recommend it to family and friends.
Courtesy bus to airport terminal was very efficient and regular. Drivers were very polite and helpful.
We would certainly use again.",4,2017,08,29
245,Business room with dreadful wifi,"Stayed there one night. Had booked a business class room. The wifi took two minutes to send a text message. I tried many times to make an audio call but my colleagues could only hear every second word.
I would definitely not recommend this hotel.
",2,2017,08,25
245,Comfortable and convenient ,"Stayed one night after dropping some family off for a late night flight. Didn't fancy a drive for three hours back home so late.

Have used this hotel many times in the past. I found the room to be spacious, clean with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. The temperature control on the shower was a bit problematic. Nothing like a lukewarm shower to waken you up in the morning!!

The breakfast buffet is top class with a wide choice to suit all tastes and appetites! Too often in the past, I had early morning departures and was not able to avail of the breakfast. 
The staff at the front desk and in the breakfast dining room were courteous and friendly. 
It may not be the cheapest hotel in the area, but it sure is convenient to the airport. ",4,2017,08,23
245,OUR STAY AT RADISSON,"Very good hotel near the airport, shuttle bus, friendly staff
We experienced both breakfast and dinner; breakfast was excellent, dinner could be improved, soup of the day was nothing special, not even the Thai chicken
Excellent position and confortble rooms 
",3,2017,08,23
245,"Convenient, good service","I flew overnight toDublin from NYC, arriving at 9am and  our rental accommodation was not ready till 3pm, so we wanted a place for the kids to sleep for a few hours. I called the hotel to make a booking for the night before and told them i wanted to check in next morning and request late checkout. When we got to the hotel we were already checked in, the bed and pull-out couch were set up and we got complimentary late check out till 3pm. We only paid for one room for 2 adults and 2 kids. The hotel is not luxury or modern, but very clean and family friendly.",4,2017,08,22
245,"A very basic hotel, poor service ",A very basic hotel with poor service and unwillingness of staff to be helpful. Food there is average and the evening restaurant and bar closes very early. You are in fact called to leave sometimes when you are siting there and you want to stay more. ,2,2017,08,22
245,An airport hotel,We stayed one night on the way to Italy and found staff helpful and the room basic and clean - that's just about it nothing special but a good place to rest for a night our perhaps for a business meeting. located about ten minute walk from the airport but the hotel provides a shuttle service that is excellent.,3,2017,08,20
245,Faultless professionalism and sincere friendliness ,"I recently stayed a couple of nights and conducted a training seminar in this hotel.
The Event Manager couldn't have done more to make this run as smoothly as possible.
Ms.Philly Erdogan was able to find space to store some large equipment and facilitated it's delivery and pick-up in my absence.
She and her team have the perfect balance of professionalism and warm friendliness that is almost impossible to get right. I was so proud in front of non-Irish colleagues that Irish Internationalism stands so tall!
",5,2017,08,19
245,Perfect for an Early Flight,"You can walk to the terminal in 3-4 minutes or they run a shuttle service. Rooms and staff are everything you expect from the Raddisson Group. Comfortable beds and spacious rooms.  I dined at the bar area and found the quality of food on offer really first rate. Excellent choice on offer for breakfast to suit all tastes.
This hotel is not cheap but if you want to get a holiday off to a good start this is a good place to stay.",5,2017,08,16
245,Classic over priced airport hotel,"You get what you expect. Great location, expensive drink and average food. Don't stay here if you want more.  It is what it says in the tin. Service in fairness is reasonable.
It's a bit odd really as the lounge is vast, busy through the say and then an empty space at night. It needs a bit of thought.",3,2017,08,14
245,Airport hotel,"This hotel has four things going for it: pleasant staff, price, comfy bed and convenient location.  It is the perfect hotel for a long layover at Dublin.

BUT, if after a long day of traveling you'd like:

1. To be able to find the pickup spot for the hotel shuttle (people were talking about it on the way to the hotel and back to the airport. The sign is too small (about the size of a business envelope) and too far way from ""Shuttles.""
2. The john to flush...""Sorry, do it three or four times. They really need to be replaced,"" I was told.  While we are in the bathroom, the shower control is unusual and the towel heater didn't work (it wasn't necessary, but would've been nice). 
3. The breakfast buffet is included, but some of it (scrambled eggs and fruit) was really unappetizing. The eggs were bottom of the barrel, burnt and dried out and the fruit was mushy.
4. The room needs updating and someone should really clean the toothpaste off the carpet.
5. Good luck figuring out how to use those Carlson points?",2,2017,08,14
245,The location is perfect if you have an early flight out of Dublin Airport!,"We were not here long, only 1 night, but it was comfortable and clean for what we needed.  The lobby was large, clean and inviting. We had an upgraded business room on the fifth floor that had nice views of the Dublin sky on our last night there. The hotel offers a free shuttle that goes to the airport 24 hours a day, every 15 minutes, which was perfect for our 6am departure.",4,2017,08,14
245,Needs some improvement ,"Spent one night here. On the plus side all the staff we came across were lovely, friendly and efficient. The food was lovely, chowder was very good. Burger not so much but ok. Breakfast buffet was lovely and well stocked. Rooms were clean. 
On the other side the rooms need a bit of tlc. Some of the furniture looks knackered and could do with being replaced. Beds were comfy but needs two pillows per person. One poor flat one doesn't quite cut it. Windows need proper double glazing, didn't bother me as I sleep with ear plugs anyway but I can imagine that it would have an effect on light sleepers. On the whole wound stay again and would recommend. Shuttle bus a bonus 
",3,2017,08,08
245,Worst hotel i had booked ,"Me and my father booked hotel on 29th to 31th july 2017 , when we reached hotel we were shocked there bed are so small to sleep , i call to reception but they said thses bed are standard size but only 1 person can sleep freely , i sleep on floor , that moment was so unforgettable, whats the use to booked that high amount of money for this cheap and third class hotel which worth 50$ only . Hotel quality is also cheap low standard material used , i will never go this hotel in my life totally 0 % satisfaction. 
Daman ",1,2017,08,08
245,Location for an early flight,"I had stayed at this hotel about 10 years prior and it was interesting to see the transition. There are a variety of hotels in the vicinity now and all offer the same fare: car-parking for the duration of your trip away, a room and a meal. The Radisson matches this well. For a high-turnover place, the room was comfortable if basic; the parking ample and the staff personable.
I did not dine there, but note they have upgraded the facilities generally in the last years and the breakfast formerly was excellent.
Nice furnishings and kind welcome: was offered an upgrade as a courtesy - nice touch. The Radisson is a tad more spendy then its competitors in the area, but the price point for a peak summer stop-over was still quite reasonable.",4,2017,08,05
245,Great airport hotel,Airport hotels are usually pretty cruddy given the amount of one night only traffic. But the Radisson Blu was very clean and well kept. The hotel restaurant was also excellent and I felt fairly priced. There is a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes to the airport which was a nice bonus. I would definitely stay here again.,4,2017,08,03
245,SO NOISY,"  This hotel sounds like it has no glass in its windows!!  Traffic starts at 4am and is constant. You can't sleep, it's as loud as if you are lying in the middle of the road! 
   We were on the 5th floor which is great if u want to watch aeroplanes take off and land. 
  Rooms are average. Beds are only queen size but it's comfortable. Bathroom is tiny and if you have particularly long legs you'll struggle to sit on the toilet. As well as a dangerously high bath with a shower in it that you have to step down from with no help from a rail or non slip stickers which are at the other end of the bath. The glass screen also swings when you accidentally lean against it so BE careful. 
  Breakfast was average and the staff don't have the Irish friendliness that we've found everywhere else although they are efficient. 
   I spent $250 to lie awake all night. Might as well sleep in your car for all the sleep you get.  
Would not recommend this hotel ",2,2017,08,02
245,Two nights more than enough,"Undoubtedly the worst Radisson hotel I have visited. The clerks at the reception were, well, working there but hey...you would expect them to know something about customer service? Anyway, overpriced rooms compared to the location and quality so I will avoid this hotel in the future. The room was shabby and some of the furniture looked like as if it was collected from flea market. Dont't open the 2nd floor window as the roof extension underneath looked like a sewage. No minibar in the room. Breakfast was not included and overpriced, car park existed but you have to pay. New towels were offered at 21.30 hrs in the evening etc. The apple pie at the hotel restaurant was excellent though. Hotel is situated right next to the airport. The reception staff should make a study visit to Beirut Radisson.",2,2017,07,31
245,Rip off Ireland is back,"Stayed here for one Tuesday night recently before a business trip 
€220 for the room 
Rip off Ireland is alive and well again 
had dinner in hotel bar not cheap 
Cheapest bottle of wine on the menu is €28 
You used be able to watch a film in your room but sadly cutbacks has ended this  

Pity its gone this way as it is very handy to the airport",2,2017,07,31
245,Best hotel I have ever been to,Was only a the hotel for one night on Friday 28th July as was attending Zz top gig in the city. The staff where Friendly and would do anything for guest. They help me by phoning me a taxi to the 3 arena and the bed was like sleeping a cloud. The bar in hotel was fantastic aswell. ,5,2017,07,30
245,Overnight Stay,"Staff at this hotel extremely professional, so friendly and reservations/reception was no exception. Sharveen who looked after checking us in was the most hospitable person I've dealt with at a reception desk and His colleague Peter was very helpful checking us out. They have the professionalism of a business hotel but they also had the friendliest manner for a family stay.  Breakfast was great too, well worth staying here and will be back.... ",5,2017,07,30
245,Functional served with a cold hot breakfast ,"Overall disappointing stay, its on airport with a shuttle so convenient rooms are spacious but need a bit of tlc. The reception and bar area are nice and bar food was good, breakfast food was actually cold which is not acceptable I did advise a manager who acknowledged the feedback and said she would inform the chef. ",3,2017,07,23
245,Airport hotel ,"Very close from terminal, with van service to the hotel, with a good breakfast and good bar restaurant in the hotel, not to many facilities in the hotel but is possible to go to a gym close to the hotel , bedroom and toilet are standard size and comfortable ",3,2017,07,19
245,Expensive for what it gives,"I do not think that airport hotels should be less considered than normal hotels.
- My toilets were broken (the flush didn't work)
- No complimentary bottle of water, as you have to ask them to the reception ... that's so weird.
- No fruits, nothing else than a room.
- Had no fidelity points on my carlson membership awarded

It's just a simple and expensive room.
I'd recommend to try the other hotels around. (&There are plenty !)",2,2017,07,19
245,Definitely NOT Raddison Blu standard and absolutely NOT a four star Hotel,"I booked this hotel because of its  proximity to the bus zones at Dublin airport ( I was catching the Translink Express Bus to Belfast the following morning) and also because of it was labelled as a Radisson Blu ( Blu being the luxury side of the Radisson Hotels). But let me tell you folks - it was anything but a 'Blu' Radisson. Reception and the bar area are nicely decorated when you enter the hotel. But that's all there is - in addition to the rooms of course which are NOT soundproofed as advertised. At check in I had been told that the room I was been given was really quiet - only to have to listen to every aircraft taking off at Departures 1 and 2 at Dublin airport. While it became quiet around 1 am, the noise level of roaring jets started had started again by 5.40. I had booked a wake up call for 6.30 am ( which I never got until 6.43am) but the sound of the aircraft had already worked me up long before that. Breakfast was good value at 11 euros including VAT. I normally stay at the Hilton close to Dublin airport when transiting through Dublin, but on this specific occasion I was catching the bus from the airport to Northern Ireland. The Hilton is a much better deal ( at 99 euros if you book early) compared with the 179 Euros plus 11 Euros for breakfast that. I paid for a supposedly ' Blu' Raddisson experience which left me with an overall sense of feeling of disappointment, exhaustion due to lack of sleep and feeling very ' Blue'. Definitely NOT a good choice of hotel for an experienced traveller.",3,2017,07,19
245,Very Convenient to Airport,"I stayed at this hotel yesterday, July 16th for a night waiting for my flight back back to the US.  Brendan at the front desk provided terrific, helpful service.  The rooms are a little dated, but mine was clean.  The hotel offers a good, complimentary breakfast for guests.  I had dinner the evening before at the hotel restaurant and it was Ok.  The restaurant was busy.  The service is solid.",4,2017,07,18
245,ACCOMODATION IS VERY GOOD,"Cleanliness of the hotle is perfect, restaurant is good and people are nice = perfect hotel. 
It is close to the Airport with a shuttle bus each 15 minutes then this is also fine.
5 minutes to get a taxi to go to city center and it cost about 20€ : not so expensive for his taxi course.",5,2017,07,18
245,An Amazing stay,Me and my wife had a really nice stay ... The staff was amazing and really helpful especially Wafa at reception.Will recommend to others and would definitely come back.The cleanliness was exemplary.The view from our room was really good.,5,2017,07,18
245,Great location but not quite 4 star standard,"My husband and I stayed overnight on July 14th. The hotel is very conveniently located on the airport campus and takes just minutes to reach from the terminals. The staff were excellent. Friendly and attentive. They are the best part of the hotel experience.
The room however was a quite disappointing. It was clean but the furniture was tired, dated and overall the hotel was functional but not luxurious. First world problem, yes but we picked the Radisson because we are familiar with the chain. However, this one does not live up to its four star rating. This hotel is great if you have an early flight to catch and want to be close to the airport. However it would be better marketing itself as a good three star rather that the poor four star that it seems to be.
Hats off to the staff though. This is a very busy hotel and they do a great job.",3,2017,07,17
245,Slow service ,Comfortable hotel very close to the airport terminals . A 3 minute walk to terminal 2 and 5 minutes to terminal 1. There is a shuttle bus operating 24 hours a day. Very slow service in the bar. Lots of supervisors present but very few supporting the busy staff. ,2,2017,07,15
245,Good Location,"Very welcoming and helpful check in staff. Could not get the lights working in my room so notified Reception and within 2 minutes Housekeeping arrived and showed me so I was impressed with that. The room was clean but a little dated and seemed more functional than luxurious. Bed was comfortable and good shower.

I ate dinner at the bar which was okay and reasonably priced. I have to say though that I had my worst pint of Guinness in Ireland and will not be ordering that again when I am due to stay there again in August. I did not have time for breakfast in the morning so I cannot comment on that. Shuttle bus was very prompt and quick which is just what you want.",3,2017,07,14
245,The black sheep of the family : tired & tatty product - lovely staff,"I guess, all hotel chains have their black sheep... For Rezidor the airport Radisson Blu is the one.

First the good: staff were attentive and helpful (with exception of the housekeeping staff who is convinced the clean lobby floor needs machine cleaning at 7pm - prime check-in time). Breakfast is good (not considering the industrial eggs used for scrambled eggs and the bacon and dried out local sausages). 
In-room coffee (Nespresso) and tea is of great value and they serve fresh milk rather then powder milk. Me as a tea lover appreciate this highly. 

The driver (especially the elderly guy but also your young black guy) are super friendly, warm and full of life and humour!!!

Check-in: prime time, 7pm - 9people queuing, only 2 of the 4 check-in desks are manned. This prompted the staff to be efficient - on account of friendliness and warm service .... :-( 

The big let-down: all lights in the hotel are ""eco friendly"" (a plus) but of the oldest and cheapest quality. The on a grey day (which Ireland has quite a few every month), the light is rather dull and more ""industrial - funeral hall"" than up-lifting. Especially with the colour scheme the hotel has chosen (off white walls, brown wood, cream colour skirting & walls). So the overall design is already not attractive. Now the age...... I am not sure when last they did an up-grade. But it looks like a US-Marriotts out of the 80ties - but fully worn out. Even the tables in the restaurant were scratched and tattered. At home, I would never live with furniture worn out - and I certainly would not offer it to any visitor - so much to the ""home away from home"" saying.....

Picture say more than words...

Oh, and funny, they offer great desk space in the room, but no chair... When I asked for a chair, the lady who was so eagerly cleaning the clean lobby floor brought a banqueting chair - without saying hi or by.... (may be she is dumb?).",1,2017,07,14
245,"Some good, some not so good","Courtesy bus to us to the hotel.  Great service.  The hotel people were friendly and helpful.  Room was clean and wifi worked well.
But...  The toilet in our room didn't flush easily but the shier was wonderful.  We had dinner in the T3 restaurant and it was a disappointment.  My steak was not made the way I like it but portions were very large and served with fresh vegetables. I took the salad instead of fried potatoes.  So even the nit so great was okay.",4,2017,07,11
245,Stop over before flying,"Never had the luxury of being on site of airport but due to technical failure of aircraft we were put up in this hotel. 
Very clean staff very good food excellent. Beautiful breakfast included. Overall i would very highly recommend.",4,2017,07,11
245,Amazing ,"What a lovely big hotel we got a massive welcome from the check-in staff and then we went to the restaurant for dinner food was amazing and not to bad prices WiFi is good and strong rooms clean, big would definitely stay again ",5,2017,07,09
245,Great service!,"We had an excellent experience at this hotel. Our server, Daria, was attentive and very personable. The front desk people were helpful and helped us to have a pleasant stay. The buffet breakfast was exceptional!

",5,2017,07,08
245,Thanks,"Reception; Bar Tenders; transfer; Salmón! All Fantastic the Room was very Confortable. Radisson Always Keep a Great Quality in Construction and the Personal very Pro. Very Close yo Airport !!!! Great chose !!!!
",5,2017,07,03
245,Fantastic airport (and more) hotel ,"We upgraded to a business class room. Lovely large room with added extras such as robes, slippers, Nespresso and dining table which was great for the included breakfast in the room the next morning. The bed was so comfortable! Air conditioning was brilliant. We stayed here as a convenient location for a morning flight. However, it is only a short ride to Dublin central so I would consider it a great location and price for a base if visiting Dublin.",5,2017,07,02
245,Old fashioned expensive ,"Well, we booked 3 rooms and paid over £500, for just 1 night!

The rooms are 3 star if that and so old fashioned! One of my colleagues ended up in a pull out bed!! We were moved to a twin which was appreciated however we really did feel ripped off!

In the morning, no scrabbled eggs or mushrooms left for breakfast and not replaced in the 30 mins we were there. We travel to Dublin a lot. But this hotel seriously needs to up its game if we are to go back!! It was not worth the money we paid at all! Avoid if you can! Feel totally ripped off and a crap nights sleep by my colleague in the pull out bed. Not good night before a big client meeting. Radisson this place lets your brand down!",1,2017,07,02
245,Quick stay in convenient location,"We enjoyed one night at this hotel before using the airport the following morning. The room was quite spacious, with plenty of room for our luggage. It and the bathroom were clean and comfortable, and we slept well. The location was incredible for easy access to the airport and its rental car return. The hotel's shuttle to the airport was efficient - and the driver friendly - and because the hotel is so close to the airport, the rental car shuttle dropped us off at the airport instead of at the terminal (where we would have then waited for the hotel shuttle.) 

We missed breakfast, as our flight required an early departure.

The hairdryer was frustrating: it would work for a few minutes, then seemed to overheat and not work for a few minutes. This cycle continued long enough that I didn't get my hair dried in time to leave for the airport.",5,2017,06,30
245,Good place,"Stayed here a few times , hotel is very close to the airport , it's 5 minutes walk from terminal 2
There is a free shuttle as well
Food is good and hotel is clean
Staff are friendly and polite , 
Good sized rooms and nice and quiet , ",4,2017,06,27
245,Very Convenient to Terminal 2!,"Excellent location, excellent breakfast, ever so convenient to buses to Dublin centre. Room was a bit hot possibly because of the sun beating down on the window (heat wave was on when I stayed here).  Plenty of parking as well.   Shuttle to Terminals 1 and 2, but also within a short walking distance.",4,2017,06,26
245,Perfect Port in the Storm,"We stayed at the Raddison Blu at the Dublin Airport the night before our flight out. After being on the road for 3 weeks it was a great place to spend the night. We were given one of the ""Business Class"" rooms. Large and well appointed the room had fast Wi-Fi and a Nespresso coffee maker, a 'frig and anything else you would need. We found the front desk staff to be very helpful and assisted as we had to turn in a rental car and ultimately find our way to the terminal in the morning. The location is great as you could almost walk to Terminal 2. Breakfast was extensive and well beyond the ubiquitous Irish Breakfast.",4,2017,06,20
245,Brilliant quality airport ,I stayed at this hotel from work as I had to get a bus to Belfast next morning. The service was very helpful and very polite! Food good and room lovely and specious ! The breakfast next morning was sooo delicious and variety of food was amazing !!! You can get a shuttle bus to the airport every 15min but I just walked to terminal 2 where all the buses stop and took me only 5 minutes ! Definitely will be staying there again! ,5,2017,06,20
245,very close to dublin airport within walking distance,"very nice hotel staff very friendly  check in is fast and friendly car park is good and not two costly ,food at the bar is very tastey rooms are clean and quite the bar staff are exellent what ever drink you fancy they can get for you ",3,2017,06,19
245,Absolute terrible experience from start to finish,"I arrived shortly after 9:45pm on June 14, 2017, following a 3 hour drive down from Royal Portrush and at the tail end of a 9 day trip through Ireland and Northern Ireland doing reviews for a golf travel site. When I walked up to the desk to check in the gentleman said he was sorry to inform me that they had my reservation for the previous night and that he was completely sold out for the night. (I 100% did not book the hotel for the wrong night but that's neither here nor there).

I mildly started to panic because I was exhausted and had to be up at 5am for a flight back home to the United States and the clock was ticking to have any rest. He told me that most hotels in Dublin were sold out that evening and that's when the real stress arrived. I politely asked him if he or the staff could do whatever possible to help me located a place to sleep. They were not interested in this one bit and walked into the back office and stopped talking to me.

I proceed to pull up Tripadvisor on the couch next to the reception desk and was getting very to little luck. Resigned to the fact that I was going to be sleeping on a couch in the airport, I walked towards the terminal with 3 bags (including a large golf bag). I decided to walk through the Maldron parking lot sweating like crazy, walked inside, and they just happened to have a room open up 15 minutes prior. Of course they were gouging and had it at $379 pounds, but it was a no brainer with how exhausted I was.

The last thing I remember from the two incredibly rude and uncompassionate, male and female front desk agents at the Radisson was them both telling me ""sir we can't do anything for you"" and looking away. The young man said I probably wouldn't be charged right before that. Of course I got home and there is a charge for $229 on my Amex Platinum. So adding it all up, I spent close to $650 for 5 hours of sleep at an airport for something I had nothing to do with, other than not calling the night before to double check.

To wrap this up, I just got an email from Amy at the hotel informing me she would ""welcome me back at the hotel"". This comes shortly after staff informing me they won't wave the night I wasn't even there.

The people of Ireland were some of the nicest and most hospitable I have ever seen, it's a shame that this had to happen at the last second. I strongly encourage visitors to stay elsewhere when flying in or out of Dublin International Airport",1,2017,06,19
245,Ok,"We've stayed here a number of times, so we're very familiar with the hotel.

The bed was really comfortable, which was brilliant because we were exhausted - there's nothing more disappointing then an uncomfortable bed!! 

The room was fairly well presented, but there was a number of marks on the bedding and some hairs. 

We were there late, so didn't have dinner etc., we just went to bed.

We'd breakfast this morning, and being honest - it was average. It really isn't what it used to be! The hot buffet wasn't so, it wasn't very warm - I'll be honest it was tasty, and edible! Just disappointing....",3,2017,06,15
245,Excellent night sleep before traveling,This was our last hotel stay before traveling back home. Hotel was very nice and clean. Our room was comfortable and so close to the airport you can walk but we used their complimentary shuttle service.  Would definitely stay here again.,5,2017,06,15
245,Good hotel next to the airport ,"The hotel is walking distance from the airport and is great for a long layover. I was forced to stay at this hotel due the other hotels being booked where I needed to be and it's a nice hotel. The restaurant is decent and the food is good at a reasonable price. I recommend getting the room with breakfast included, the buffet is good. ",4,2017,06,15
245,excellent hotel,We stayed in the hotel the day before we traveled . It was so relaxing just to chill out the night before not having to rush about in the morning travelling to airport etc. looking for parking . This was a complete stress free experience and i would highly recommend it,5,2017,06,14
245,Terrible Value,"€230 for exec room - no tissues, no battery in tv remote, bed so soft you roll into the middle, b'fast most unappetising - scrambled eggs tasted like they were cooked night before, furnishings could not have been cheaper or more plasticky, staff indifferent, shower so badly designed that it soaked entire bathroom.  The only saving grace was that dinner was quite good.  By comparison, the Radisson Blu in Dublin proper had an exec room @ €258 that was superb and 5 star.  The airport location has you captive if you need to fly out early but never again will I stay there.j",2,2017,06,13
245,Excellent experience ,"My family and I attended a function in the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport today and it was just excellent. The staff were incredibly attentive, so kind to everyone, nothing was too much of a problem. Food was great, amazing selection and the kids were very well catered for. Hope to return again soon! ",5,2017,06,10
245,Excellent hotel,"Great check in and out at reception.
Good size room very clean, breakfast was good, great choices and service.
Stayed several times and each time I stay it's been great.
Would highly recommend if in the area",5,2017,06,07
245,Short overnight stay,"Arrived late, and must say from terminal one it is not easy to figure how to walk to it, as there are no signs, it is not far 900 m, but if you have luggage maybe better to take the shuttle bus, as there are stairs and big streets to cross.
Hotel is outdated and not exactly modern, but bed was ok, coffea machine in room. Better shower would be a good add on.
Wifi worked, breakfast is reasonable, however 160 euro for stay is high for what they offer.",3,2017,06,07
245,Good experience,"My overall impression is that all staff are most helpful,kind and caring.i have recommended this hotel to my family and friends.we were travelling to Canada and stayed the night prior to travel.we both felt well rested and enjoyed our breakfast.the shuttle bus service again was high quality service.we both felt that we had a very enjoyable experience.",5,2017,06,06
245,Your basic airport hotel,"This hotel has just the basics.  The room was okay.  It doesn't have any electrical outlets near the bed for charging a phone overnight.  The bed was tiny and very soft, so I didn't sleep well.  The bathroom was fine, and the wifi was fine.  The food in the restaurant wasn't very good.  The shuttle service to the airport is excellent.  I had a drink in the bar, and it was very loud.  The room price was very expensive. Overall, this is your basic airport hotel.  I'll probably stay there again when I'm flying out of Dublin in the morning.",3,2017,06,05
245,"Dirty, Old & Overpriced",This is by far the worst Radisson hotel I've ever stayed in. The room was dirty with the smallest beds ever. There was a try outside the door with the previous guests dinner on it several hours after we were checked in and it was most certainly not worth the €185 per night.,2,2017,06,04
245,Better options available,Wouldn't recommend the restaurant if your from an ethnic minority.  Get treated like a second class citizen and attitude for asking for a finger bowl or the bill... Much better options available in Dublin. Rooms are clean. Not particularly modern. Good if you want to get your head down. ,1,2017,06,02
245,Far exceeded our expectations! Very Very Nice.,Room was lovely. Staff was outstanding. Great shuttle service. Fabulous free breakfast buffet every morning. Hotels near airports are rarely this nice. We spent one night at the Hilton Dublin and left after a terrible night and spent the next 10 days at the Radisson.,5,2017,06,01
245,Just what you need,Hotel is fine for a hotel airport. We got offered an upgrade which we took. Room was spacious and there was a coffee machine...asked for more coffee pods and staff were happy to supply us with some. Bed was extremely comfortable. Lots of choice at breakfast. ,5,2017,06,01
245,"ONE NIGHT STAY, HOTEL NEEDS UPDATING",Stayed one night before flying home from Dublin.  Hotel seemed dated and needs updating. Staff fine especially luggage man who was excellent upon arrival and leaving.  Great location just 5 minutes from airport ia shuttle. Just expected better from the Radisson name.,3,2017,05,29
245,Terrible lunch & staff,"Had lunch here on Sunday, in fairness there was a very large group of us attending a meeting there all day, but if they couldn't cater for us we should have been informed, waited 1hour for a chicken salad that had 4 pieces of chicken 4 cherry tomatoes and 4 leaves of lettuce, that was it... and was charged €8:50, I did complain but to be honest the lady in charge was very rude and walked away. Needless to say avoid the food and restaurant it's a rip off, but the hotel it's self and meeting rooms were lovely ",1,2017,05,25
245,Good Location,"This hotel is located within walking distance of both terminals so therefore very handy, easier than trying to find the bus. The rooms were fine but could do with a bit of refurbishment as it is beginning to look a bit tired.",3,2017,05,24
245,Easy access to terminals for an early flight,"We stayed overnight and were surprised at the quality of the rooms and the offer of an early continental breakfast in our room as we would be too early for breakfast. 
The dining room is a bit dated but the food was good. The wine list was extensive but also expensive",4,2017,05,24
245,"They say they have a gym, they don't! ","Luckily did only 1 overnight stay and in shock due to the low quality service of this hotel. After work, wanted to spend couple of hours at the gym and they made me wait at reception 15 min for find out that the gym is in a separate building 10 min by car from the hotel. Once arrived at the gym (pretty average to be a private one) found out they have no wifi available so I wasn't able to perform my exercises. 
Had to wait another 20 min for the driver to pick me up. 
Bed is uncomfortable and pillows flat. 
Not worth the price. ",2,2017,05,23
245,Handy !,"Overnighting at the airport and this place delivered the convenient goods ! The room was a good size...with not quite enough furniture to fill it. The bed was comfortable albeit it had a wooden base that was larger than the bed frame - 'ouch' when your ankles (repeatedly) bumped into it ! €12 for 24 hours parking. OK service...without the standout exception of Kevin in housekeeping. His customer service was exceptional and memorable - friendly, responsive and enthusiastic. Thank-you Kevin. A real Ambassador for the hotel !",3,2017,05,22
245,overnight stay,"Stayed overnight ,arrived early evening check in staff excellent  and very friendly ,room was clean and tidy had everthing you needed for your stay.we then decieded to have dinner and a few drinks,food was very good service efficient and good choices on menu .would definitely recommend it ,didnt have time for breakfast as catching our flight, courtesy bus took us to our terminal so you arrive stress free for your flight.",5,2017,05,21
245,"Very good room, service, breakfast. Dinner - not so sure ","A very convenient location. Arrived by rental car.  Parking is at a premium, so a bit of luck is required.  It is not free!  Front desk service was friendly and efficient. Our (business class) room was clean and tidy.  The bathroom gave us no concerns. 
Dined in the bar area.  Service was great but my meal of beer battered cod was a disaster.  A huge slab of not very fresh fish which was difficult to swallow.  However we found breakfast, while standard fare, was great.  Would stay again. Recommended.",4,2017,05,21
245,Good Friday turns to Bad Friday,"Like a previous review (Good Friday Fiasco) I too stayed here on Good Friday prior to an early morning departure on the Saturday morning. Upon check in, to the amusement of the receptionist, we were read our rights as to the 1 drink rule we were to adhere to because of the Irish licensing laws on good Friday. 1 drink with a meal and that's it. We had already eaten so were told unless we ordered food we could not have a drink. We were informed that we could go to our room and order 1 drink from room service instead. I know there is talk of the laws changing next year but that's it for me with the Radisson group of hotels.. won't be returning ... I'll be using the Maldron across as i have usually done... better service ... cheaper prices and a much more sensible approach to their bar.",1,2017,05,20
245,A Convenient Place to Charge My Batteries,"I stayed at this hotel upon arriving to Dublin from the US. The shuttle was extremely prompt and the driver was friendly and informative. The front desk agent was kind and efficient and assisted me with an early check in which I appreciated. The grab and go breakfast with bottled water was nice. The room was fun - clean and comfortable though a bit tired but totally suitable for a place to crash and between the friendly service and convenient location, I was very pleased.",5,2017,05,19
245,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here for a meeting so arrived the. night before. Check in was quick and friendly,
My room was basic but very large and had view of the bay (far on the horizon)  The staff were excellent. The room needed a bit of paint here and there with no mini bar for water.  In the evening I had fish cake for a starter and lamb for the main. I have to say above normal for a chain hotel. The fish cake was tasty the lamb was soft and the whole thing was excellent. The service was fast and friendly. Do try the Guinness
The next day we had a meeting in the lounge with ample seating and teas and coffees on tap as well as a light lunch. Again very good.
I have the feeling the Radisson is just overtaking the Hilton in terms of value for money.",5,2017,05,18
245,"First night in Dublin - clean, friendly hotel","First night in Dublin we stayed here.  the restaurant was lovely, the hotel was clean, my sleep was perfect, and the staff were out of this world.  would stay again.  No noise noticed, even being so close to the airport",5,2017,05,17
245,The upgraded room was great,"This a great hotel right by the airport. Our room was upgraded to a business room and the difference made our stay even better than before. On the top floor there were great views across the bay and I sat there watching the planes coming in to land while enjoying a coffee from the nespresso machine. The room was spotless and larger than the regular rooms with a nice sizes desk, small table and 2 chairs. Complimentary guessing gowns and slippers were a very nice touch too.",5,2017,05,17
245,Convenient. Not much else in its favour.,"We stayed here for one night, arriving late in the evening after a long flight. The hotel served our purpose - close to the hotel, quiet with a comfortable bed. It's not somwhere I'd recommend staying longer.",3,2017,05,13
245,Perfect!,"Spacious, clean, comfortable and well appointed room! Friendly efficient service.
5 minute walk to good local pub restaurant.
Free 5 minute van ride, leaving every 15 minutes, to departure terminals.
This was the perfect hotel for our next morning departure from Dublin.",5,2017,05,13
245,Very disappointed,"We were checked in by a very nice young man which is the only good thing I can say about our stay.  I am grateful it was for only one night as not only was it a lot more than expected, rubbish in bins left by previous occupants, toilet was coming away from wall and you had to be very careful if you had to sit on it, rubber around shower glass was filthy.  We arrived for breakfast 8am and most of the food which was not in a cooler was dry.    Will not recommend this hotel.",3,2017,05,08
245,A great location with great service by the airport,We stayed there twice during our two week Easter break. We were so happy to be close to the airport. The customer service was amazing along with comfy beds. We ate one night in the restaurant and food was excellent. Only boo-boo was the shuttle dropped us off at terminal one instead of two. We were a little panicked since we couldn't find Ryanair but all things worked out.,4,2017,05,07
245,A breath of fresh air ,"I stayed at the beginning of May and was welcomed by a young lad (Peter). I was staying for business and only needed the room for a night. I informed Peter that I needed to do sons work, so he offered me an upgrade to business class which came with a larger desk area and with some amenities for 40€ extra, and I am delighted that I took it. The room was lovely and during my check in time Peter even organised for a welcome not with a personalised message to be delivered to my room before I got there. Exceptional service and this should not go unknown!!! I hope I get the chance to stay again!!!!",5,2017,05,06
245,Super service,"I have stayed in the Radisson Blu Hotel last week. I was checked in by a very polite man called Peter. At check in he noticed we are travelling from Poland and used Polish to checked us in. It was very professional. He offered us breakfast and an upgrade. We got full service. The room was lovely. We had food in the bar each night. It was a great experience. We were sad to leave and we will be back. 
I would like to thank Peter for making our stay special and personalised at check in and out. We will remember you. Dziekuje.",5,2017,05,04
245,Business meeting before flight,"Arranged to meet colleagues here, so hired a meeting room which was very pleasant with tea and coffee, biscuits, free wifi and all required stationery. Only 5 mins walk to terminal 2 and 8 mins to Terminal 1",4,2017,05,04
245,"Good hotel, convenient location ","Stayed here the night before catching an early flight, nice modern hotel. Was upgraded to a larger room with a nespresso machine. Great bar with a lively atmosphere good selection of beers and great food.

Very close to the airport, a short walk. ",4,2017,05,04
245,Convenient Airport Hotel,"10 mins walk from both terminals at Dublin airport.  Ideal for business travellers like myself.  Stayed in business room - space was ample, bed very comfortable and breakfast plentiful.  Shower was a bit disappointing - water sprayed over bath onto bathroom floor making it quite wet.  Reception staff very helpful. Overall good value, will stay again.",4,2017,05,01
245,arrived very late and tired to a welcoming comfortable bed,"arrived at the airport very late.  we were collected within 10 minutes by their courtesy shuttle bus.  the room was fantastic, very comfortable bed and  great facilities in the bedroom,  the bathroom had toileteries and was spotless, was just heaven when you are tired. we had a lovely breakfast the following morning and the staff were very friendly.",5,2017,05,01
245,Honest review,"Consideration should be giving to a reasonable priced overnight stay to those making an early flight. People who travelled with us on the flight stayed at an hotel 10 mins drive away from airport for 50 euro with free parking for a week, we paid 210 euro.",5,2017,04,30
245,Give it a miss!,"We checked into the hotel the night before we were due to fly on our holidays as the parking and proximity to the airport is quite convenient. 

The hotel however is not what we expected for a Radisson. The staff throughout were pleasant and friendly. It was obvious though that the room was half way through renovation. The carpet was clean and new, however wasn't fitted 100% yet so it was sticking up along the skirting boards and was all loose. The furniture was old and looked like it belonged in the 80s. The TV was tiny and had terrible reception. When I went to plug in my phone charger, I noticed the sockets were coming off the wall. There was a frightening buzzing noise and I immediately removed the plug. I got an awful fright! The bed was large and comfy but the bathroom was truly awful. 
The tiles were stained, the bathtub itself was rusted and had so many cracks and chips in it. The towels felt like sand paper. The toilet felt like it was going to come away from the wall every time you sat on it. 

The worst however was the bar/restaurant. It's all dark wood, old furnishings and dim lightening and is not very pleasant or welcoming unlike the cafe/lounge you walk through to get to the bar. 

I ordered a glass of wine and immediately changed my mind when I saw the amount of flies resting inside all the glasses hanging up. It turned my stomach. Instead I ordered a G&T knowing the glasses were safely tucked away upside down under the bottle displays. I understand when warmer(ish) weather comes in, you get these kinds of flies but there was no attempt of getting rid of them. No fly catchers, nothing! It was as if the bar staff were oblivious to them all.

We ordered food about an hour or two later when we noticed the restaurant was getting busy and didn't fancy wandering around in Dublin to find somewhere to eat when we needed an early night to catch a flight the next morning. This was the worst decision we ever made. I was physically sick and bloated for 24 hours after this meal. This isn't a pleasant feeling when you're flying 6 hours the next day.  We ordered hummus and flatbreads and the pizza. The hummus was totally inedible as it was just dried up chickpeas. I quite literally had to use a knife and fork to get it out of the ramekin and then changed my mind quickly. The pizza was greasy and doughy. Again, not pleasant at all.

To anyone reading this, it's relatively clean to throw your head down for a few hours before your flight but seriously avoid the bar/restaurant. Or better yet, just avoid the hotel altogether and go to the Carlton like we usually do. Lesson learned!",1,2017,04,29
245,Good Choice for Red-Eye Flights,"The Radisson Blu ticked all the required boxes for our airport stop-over recently. The rooms were large & comfortable, bathroom also had plenty of space. We used very few of the hotel's supporting services such as the bars/restaurants, but all the decor & style is exactly as you would expect from this hotel brand.

As nice touch for those of us flying out on the early morning 'red-eye' flights was the complimentary fruit bowl, snacks & hot drinks table in the lobby area - this made the 5 minute walk to the terminal a whole lot more tolerable!",3,2017,04,29
245,Worse than I thought it would be. . .,"The good - hotel location is convenient to the airport. Hotel lobby seemed clean and inviting. Hotel desk staff is pleasant although completely in over their heads. This became apparent when the front desk clerk disappeared for five minutes while I was checking in at 11:30 on a Wednesday night. Simultaneously, another guest checking in was handed a key and asked ""Is this one clean?"" When assured it was, he said ""third time's a charm."" Meaning, he checked into two dirty/unmade-up rooms before being promised a clean room. I was also promised a clean room as it turns out the reason why the desk clerk ran off was to search for clean rooms. 

Honestly, the room is pretty awful. The full sized bed (only bed in room) is reminiscent of a triscuit and I am confident I would be more comfortable on the floor - if I weren't completely terrified of the carpet. There is black mold behind the headboard (room is very musty). The furniture situation is bizarre. The tv is mounted to a dirty and cracked wall wall opposite the bed, there are no lamps - only overhead lighting which requires getting up from the bed to turn out the lights, and no electrical outlets even close to the bed. 

This is bad, friends. Unacceptable. Do yourself a favor. And book elsewhere.",1,2017,04,26
245,Not a 4 star hotel,"Receptionist smiled and was congenial and informative about hotel services such as meal availability.
Shampoo and conditioner excellent quality.
Bus shuttle available every 15 minutes.
Nice view.
We liked the room decor and lighting.

However the following ítems were lacking.
1. No bidet.
2. No securiity safe.
3 A spare pillow should be available in room. Not everyone likes a low pillow.
4. Breakfast not included in room price.
5. Only one tiny piece of soap.

눘",3,2017,04,25
245,Delightful Stay at the Radisson Blu,"Our room was very comfortable and spacious. The bed was exceptionally comfortable.  My only complaint about the room is that I couldn't locate an outlet for drying my hair that was close to a mirror. Internet access a bit slow, but not unmanageable.    ",4,2017,04,25
245,Good Friday fiasco,"We booked into The Radisson, Dublin Airport on Good Friday as we had an early flight on Saturday morning.  We are Irish and well aware of the present Laws.  When booking, we asked if the bar would be open and were told it would.  My husband had just come home from abroad and was looking forward to a couple of creamy pints of Guinness (He claims they are never the same abroad).
On arrival, we went to the restaurant for dinner.  There we were told by a lady restaurant manager that we were only allowed 1 drink each.  When we asked why, we were told that it was, after all, Good Friday.  We could have a bottle of wine between us or 1 pint of guinness and a glass of wine.
Our friends arrived and they were as indignant as we were but we were our of options.  A waiter took our drinks orders and then the lady manager sent him over again to tell us we had met our quota!
We are mid 50 year olds, with an early flight and just wanted to relax and make our own decisions on what we drank!  
We would have all walked out but we had paid for our rooms and had no option.  The lady manager was neither visibly nor verbally Irish but seemed to enjoy lecturing us on the Irish Catholic way.
Eventually, a male manager appeared.  We explained our situation to him and thanks to him we used our own discretion on what we ordered.  BTW he was neither visibly nor verbally Irish either.
The law in Ireland is changing anyway next year, we were residents of the hotel and in my opinion, respectable, respectful adults. 
Why 1 drink if they had an issue?
To but honest,  still thinking about it, I am absolutely horrified that we were treated this way.",1,2017,04,25
245,Much less value that expected,"When I pay almost 170 € in a four star hotel I tend to be expecting excellence. Instead all was about average, the best value being the very efficient airport shuttle. Frigobar in the room was empty, the choice of complimentary hot drinks in the room didn't include a herbal fit for late evening, the bathroom kit was cheap and the much publicized Grab and go breakfast in the early morning is of very limited and poorly organized quality, Some advice here: give a smart little paper bag to pick up the things, give a wider choice of cereal bars (and of better quality): for example some gluten free, organic, fair trade... give a feeling of attention and value, some fruit juice. Fruits were poor quality, very much cheap supermarket. Hotel should remember that they have got the money for a full breakfast even for the customers who have to leave early, before they can consume it!
Final note: the sound insulation of the rooms is not excellent: we could hear the neighbors talk in the night.",3,2017,04,23
245,Well situated at the airport ,The hotel is a short walk from the terminals although the hotel offer a transfer service every 15 minutes. We were upgraded to business class room and it was nice and airy although the bathroom needs to be upgraded as it was full of mould and smelly. Don't bother eating in the restaurant! It was total mayhem with conference delegates making it very busy and one family had to get up twice to remind the staff of their order. The food was very basic and service slow and staff confused. Breakfast was ok although again service was patchy and things missing. ,3,2017,04,22
245,Night before flight to Brussels ,"Not looking forward to an early flight i drove to Dublin airport thinking i will have a couple of pints and something tasty to eat. The young man at check in couldnt have been nicer. Checked in with no issues and a smile. Well done. My room was  good as well so everything was going well. I went down to the bar for a few pints and something to eat. Service at the bar was slow. I ordered the friday night special of steak and chips for 15 euro, it was just ok. I suppose it was 15euro! 
This morning leaving at 4.45 the was coffee, fruit and a cereal bar for the take away breakfast. I got the free shuttle to T2 which took less than 5 mins. 
I have left my car there for the 5 nights i am away so all things considered this is a decent place to stay for 1 night if you have an early flight. 
Would i stay again maybe not.",3,2017,04,22
245,A most excellent evening,The room facet was leaking which i reported.  Other then that I had the most peaceful sleep and the service was excellent.  I would consider staying again.  Breakfast buffet was massive and tasty. I enjoyed eating as well in the restaurant.,5,2017,04,21
245,Perfect  overnighter for an early-morning flight departure,"Within walking distance of the airport terminals but a shuttle bus takes you back and forward free of charge every quarter of an hour and runs all night. Facilities are very good and include access free of charge to the nearby sports centre and pool. Breakfast is hearty and reasonably-priced. Room was well above average for under £100 per night. Lovely big comfy bed. Nice restaurant. Meals cheaper than in city centre. Quiet, peaceful venue. Helpful staff. Cool bar area, well-stocked. All-in-all, a most pleasant interlude.",4,2017,04,18
245,Back again,"This is our first time staying at the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport where we we early enough to consider a drink in the bar before bed. We book when we are on late or early flights. We arrived about 6pm, check-in was really quick and Silvia was very polite. We received a complimentary upgrade to a business room which was great. Loads of space and views over the airport. 

The kitchen was cooking up a storm. We didn't go for food as my Mum had sent us with a picnic but we had a few drinks. The food looked good though. 

The room was clean and the bed comfy. Just the right amount of support for us. We did have to call down for another towel as there was only one in the room. That took quite a while so I was glad we noticed the night before the mad rush in the morning for our early flight.

There was coffee/tea, juice, water and fresh fruit in the lobby for us early birds which I thought was a really lovely touch.

They also run a free shuttle to the airport 24 hours a day. We only waited for 5 mins after an efficient checkout and were safely deposited in front of our terminal. They do go to both terminals. Terminal 2 first.

We will certainly be back and it isn't just about convenience, as there are other hotels in the area. ",4,2017,04,11
245,Exceeds expectations from a chain,"On a recent trip to Dublin, I spent two nights here. One was booked, the other was unplanned but the hotel made it possible which I appreciated. 
My room was as close as they could get me to the lift as I can't walk very far. 
The room was large and roomy, warm and easy to get into the bathroom. All important points for partially disabled clients. 
Food was excellent, and room service open until late. 
And front desk offered to deliver my luggage to my room which was very appreciated. 
It's a little more expensive, but well worth it as Raddison show they appreciate your custom and have choices in a competitive market. ",5,2017,04,09
245,Convenient but that's about it,"I stayed 2 nights, one at each end of my trip to accommodate flight arrangements.  The first night was in a horrible room that was very dated and the bathroom seemed like it was from an old hospital, with a red rope hanging from the ceiling with instructions to pull it if you need a nurse's assistance!! (I didn't try it.) I think the front desk staff was annoyed with me asking if my room was ready yet, and got me good! The second night was in a better, my room was ready upon my arrival, a more modern room, which was ok, but the tub was very old and needed repair around the tiles. The restaurant food is good enough and the staff was accommodating.  But the dishes were very dirty.  I was served milk for my coffee in a serving pitcher that had brown gravy left on the inside of the rim and on the outside.  Yuk.  I would definitely try another hotel for my next visit, if I needed an overnight near the airport again.",2,2017,04,09
245,On the airport,"The best thing, the hotel is on the airport and you can walk to the Terminals although it involves tramping across a car park and some road crossings that don't flow naturally.  Yet, you can and it takes less than 10 mins.

At 149 euro you get a busy reception, a room that could be an office, a restaurant that is better than it looks, but utilitarian and wifi that is free, yet slow.

This hotel needs a competitor as it seems to be happy to muddle along on the basis of ""where else can you go on the airport"".

I will stay there again out of necessity, not choice.

",2,2017,04,07
245,Good standard,"Good standard hotel. Rooms spacious, clean, comfortable. Wi fi free works well. Food very good. Employees useful and kind. Has the advantage of being at the airport, just 5 min. away, but this also a minus as there is jets' roaring all nigth.
Free shattle.",4,2017,04,06
245,"Dated rooms, but convenient","This hotel is quite poorly signed from Terminal 1; I spent a good few minutes walking around the short stay car park at the front of the terminal building before realising I needed to walk back to the bus lanes, all in an area that looked distinctly uncared for that clearly hadn’t seen a paint brush since the last century.  Thankfully my sojourn to the car park hadn’t made me miss a shuttle bus, as one rolled up within a couple of minutes of my arrival.

I had opted for the reasonably priced Radisson as it was the closest chain hotel to the airport - there is a Hilton, but it’s a little farther out and every second counts when you’re waking up early.  The shuttle driver was pretty informal but I was at the hotel in 5 minutes.  First impressions weren't the most positive, as the welcome was less than warm but check-in was nevertheless efficient and I was soon on my way up to the 4th floor where my standard room awaited.  

Described as featuring ‘stylish, modern decor’ on the website, it was clear that my room hadn’t quite got the message and had yet to be refurbished as although spacious and clean, it was very dated.  The furniture in particular was rather odd, including a random desk with no chair and the two armchairs by the table disgustingly stained.  Other annoyances included an empty minibar - defeating the point of convenience, no safe or ironing board, no power sockets near the bed, a stained towel in the bathroom, slightly smeary windows and a lack of green teabags.  The room in general was just a little run down - the bathroom featured old fixture marks in the tiles for instance.

However, it wasn’t all bad as the free wifi was a fairly fast 22mbps, there was a nice large space for suitcases (something which so many hotels don’t provide these days), the TV had HD channels with no fussy menus (what a concept!) and the bed did the job of providing an adequate night’s sleep, despite a few noises being audible from the corridor and water pipes. 

The bathroom featured rather boring thisworks amenities and was pretty stark, with a distinctly odd placement of the toilet facing the wall with little legroom.  The basin tap was pretty fierce which caught me out on the first use. 

After calling several times for room service and getting no response, I resorted to walking down to reception to order.  The lady at the desk was apologetic and gave me some complimentary bottles of water instead of adding them to the room service order, which was welcomed.  My requested ironing board and slippers arrived promptly in the room just ahead of my light dinner of a salmon salad, which was perfectly adequate but otherwise unremarkable. 

Check-out the next morning was quick and efficient, and once again I’d unintentionally timed the shuttle well as it left just a minute or two after check-out.  This time I shared the ride with three other guests, and we made a quick stop at T2 before proceeding to the next door T1 from where BA flights depart.",3,2017,04,04
245,Just fine,"I have been in this hotel couple of times in rooms with different standard. My impression is that rooms standard is just average. Hotel is under renovation but it looks I was not lucky enough to get renovated room. I do not like old style bathroom at all. Chair in from of the desk was very bad (kind of loose)

Check-in process was easy and smooth. It took less than 5 min. 

Indeed hotel has great location. Just few minutes walk from the airport terminals. ",3,2017,03,30
245,Luxury beyond comparison!,"It was my first time here.  I have always intended to stay but never got around to it.  However I was leaving for NZ and saying good-bye to the family for 6 months so I thought I would treat us to a night here as my flight was the next day.
We were:
Upgraded to an Executive Superior Room
Given Free late checkout  (1500hrs)
A free desert each in the restaurant
A free drink each in the bar
The room was just something out of this world.  Amazing.  The staff were so accommodating too.
There is a small charge for the carpark to stay overnight, but I am arriving back in Dublin on 24th June and I have already booked a night there for my return.
5 mins to the Terminal
Exceptionally clean hotel",5,2017,03,29
245,Enjoyed my stay!,"Couldn't fault this place. Only spent the night in a ""junior suite"" which was very spacious and comfy. Great view of the airport and the customer service as spiffing as ever. From my experience, this was a very nice hotel indeed, and shall consider staying here whenever I next stop in Dublin Airport.",5,2017,03,29
245,After match lie down,"Booked this Hotel to stop in after the match and on the way home to Newry
Nice people at reception, good clean room with tea/coffee making facilities 

My wife said the best thing about this Hotel was the bar with excellent cocktails served by a friendly, courteous, smart barman called Michael. 

That good we visited again on Sunday afternoon  before catching a flight to England",4,2017,03,28
245,Not what I expected!,"Checked in late on Wednesday 8th March.

Receptionist pleasant and helpful.

Room was a huge disappointment - a bed that folded into the wall presumably because this room doubled up as a meeting room.

The bed was uncomfortable and the seatbelt-like straps used to retain the bed in the fold-up position, were left under the sheets.  I had to get out of bed, strip back the sheets and remove the buckles to a position where I would not be lying on them.

As bad as this was, the type of bed I had meant that there is a screen either side of it which entails one physically getting out of bed to switch on the bedside lights!!

I was getting up at 4am to catch an early flight and this room was neither comfortable or restful.  A real let down and very poor value for money.  To my mind, when they are letting this room, or any like it, they should forewarn customers and give them the chance to either book another room or a different hotel.

My final point - and this is almost funny - there were NO CLOTHES HANGERS in the closet.  I've been travelling and staying in hotels worldwide for over 20 years and this was a first for me.

I will not be returning to the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport - if I had not been dashing to an early morning flight, I would have demanded my money back but as it was, I was more concerned with catching a flight than having an argument with the night/early morning receptionist.

You've been warned!",2,2017,03,24
245,Pretty good,"You can walk or get the laid-on hotel shuttle bus from the airport to this hotel. I walked and it took about 8 minutes. The hotel has a huge, roomy and very marble looking foyer where I found the reception staff to be welcoming, helpful and charming. The pricing for breakfast was, well, annoying! Two can eat for €14.99. But I am only one. But get charged for two anyway. I looked for a homeless person to treat as I was paying for two anyway but alas was unable to find anyone at short notice. Breakfast was very good. Dinner was less impressive but still not bad though. I had steak which was cooked well but didn't come with much. I was still hungry. It was very busy and I waited 45 minutes for a dessert, eventually giving up and telling the waitress. She apologised and said she would have it brought to my room. ""That's kind"" I thought. But I have just now noticed a room charge on my bill which is more that the dessert I ordered. Not impressed at all and feel cheated. However, all things considered (and assuming that surprise charge was an honest mistake!) this hotel is one that I would recommend. Just count your change.",4,2017,03,24
245,One of the grottiest Radisson hotels in the range,"With early morning flights from Dublin, the choice is basically this Radisson or the Maldron. I only know the former, so I usually choose the Radisson - it's comfortable and quiet, very conveniently located - it's within easy walking distance of the terminal, but they don't tell you that. The problem is it's old and tired - a general theme that persists. This time, when I checked it I went to the room, the key didn't work (yawn) - went back for a new one.. this key worked, but on entry I was assailed by a massive concentration of air freshener in the air, masking the smell of smoke from the previous occupant. I went back and asked for a move, which was quickly and easily granted, into a lovely clean room. It seems to be a feature of airport hotels that some guests just can't comply with no smoking rules, this has happened to me several times. The bathroom was oddly compact in the room, the heating didn't seem to work but I didn't mind, the bed was lovely. The restaurant was very good though, the food and drink very tasty. It's the appearance and the feel that drag it down. I'm sure I'll be back, but I'd love another alternative. ",3,2017,03,22
245,Frustratingly bad service.,"There is a complete lack of training and cop on (common sense) across all the front end staff in this hotel. They are painfully disengaged and unable to resolve even the smallest issue and deal with the guests.

The check in process was painful and it took 35 mins for me to actually get into my room with just one person in the line in front of me.
I noticed while in the line that none of the 3 persons at the check in desks (only one of which was busy with guests) greeted people in the queue or motioned to come forward. They just kept answering the phone or tapping away on the computer. As my finance had checked in earlier that day I explained that I was already checked-in, and I just required the room key he left at reception for me under my name which I provided to her and the room number. The girl spent over 10 mins searching for the key when I finally said can’t you just give me a new one if you can’t find mine. She said she would need her supervisor as they couldn’t find my car keys? I was stumped – she hadn’t listed to me when I asked for the ROOM key and didn’t listen again when I suggested she just give me a new one, if she had she would have understood I was not looking for the car key?

Then taking the lift to my floor the lift wouldn’t work but another guest used his card and it worked. I should have known there was an issue but I proceeded to my room and found that the card wouldn’t work and I had to go back to reception and queue again!

That evening, I went down to the bar for food and it was packed and noisy so I asked if I could eat in the lounge (as there were other guests doing so) area and was told yes and handed a menu . This area is not serviced well and I had to wait 20 mins before anyone came out from the bar into the lounge to take my order. I did notice every other table looking around as well and when I got my order in they all pounced on that one waiter as they all had been waiting a long time to order a drink or desert etc.  The meal took 30 mins to come out and despite ordering a steak I got no steak knife. While he delivered it I used that opportunity to order a glass of wine which came well after I was finished my meal as they had sent it to wrong table.

The lounge was also freezing and I never saw anyone once I got my desert (which I had to go into the bar to order). I got a cheese board that was served with frozen grapes. That’s bizarre. I then had to go back in to my request bill and I was very tempted to leave it! The waiter brought it out but as I was paying by card I waited a full 25 mins and eventually asked someone one running by, to please bring the machine out so I could pay.  

Maybe it’s a symptom of being an airport hotel but it has no attention to detail, no customer service and is nowhere near a four star hotel service wise.

After breakfast the next morning the room key didn't work again to get the lift. I just don’t understand how this can happen? 

Rooms clean and bed comfortable but the bathroom is 2 star standard – terrible paint job and shoddy fixtures and ugly grouting around the bath. Breakfast is fine but at €186 it’s not worth it. The Maldron up the road is much better.",1,2017,03,21
245,Lovely hotel and staff,"We were in Dublin for the weekend and telephoned beforehand to ask if we could have early check in as we were arriving on an 11am flight, we were in our rooms by 11.45 which was fantastic. The rooms were comfortable, we had view of the planes arriving but could not hear a sound from them. The bed was lovely and comfortable. Bathroom was clean and a decent size. There was tea and coffee making facilities ,
 a hairdryer , iron and ironing board too which was handy.
We had a drink in the bar which was a lovely area and had football on the tv.  The front reception staff were so knowledgable and helpful. Cabs to the Guiness factory were 30euros and to the zoo 35 euros.
We booked breakfast which was tasty and worth the money if you book it when you check In It is 5 euros cheaper.
We checked out our of our room and left our luggage with the reception staff and went to the zoo for the day.. We got back and went to bar for a drink and then headed over to the airport taking the shuttle bus which only took a couple of minutes to get there.
I really liked the hotel and would definately recommend a stay here with breakfast.",4,2017,03,19
245,"Perfect for a pre flight stay, right on the airport grounds","Perfect location, friendly staff, good rooms and decent restaurant, fast and efficient transfer to the terminal just 2 minutes away. The best option for an easy getaway early morning for a flight.
Would recommend the hotel to any traveler using Dublin airport",4,2017,03,17
245,Feeling at home,"I had to stay close to the airport cause I was flying very early in the morning. Radisson blue was recommended to me, but i was expecting just another faceless big airport hotel. NO! Stuff made me feel totally at home. What i loved most was the calm warm wake up voice, of a real person and not a machine, at 3 in the morning!!!",5,2017,03,17
245,Crowne I'm coming back!,"Arrived late pm after long walk with bags found bus stop at the other terminal. Small bus arrived 10 mins later. Perfect. Arrived at reception tried to provide Carlson number and was told don't need this as you booked via Expedia and you don't get points unless you book direct!  This was news to me. But hey big  deal rarely use this chain and will re think with this silly policy really made me feel welcome. 

Tried to find a socket for laptop in room desk area not possible to work and charge and this was a business room. The decor and bathroom looks like it needs a re vamp. Water in fridge and large coffee machine good. Ordered 3 starters as no real desire for main entree. Chowder was fantastic, chicken wings greasy and Thai crab cakes yuk!  Rosaleen kindly asked if all was ok and I explained. she promptly offered alternatives. Very professional. I declined and was provided a glass of red complimentary and the two items removed from bill.  I would like to thank Rosaleen and the bar staff despite being very busy they demonstrated customer care. 

But, yes I'm staying with the crowne plaza at Dublin airport next 

A room that I can charge my stuff with out being a removal man a. A bathroom which I don't need my diy kit. 

An Irish bar with ambience, atmosphere not an American sports bar. .

245,Lovely hotel and staff,"I booked to stay for 2 nights as I had to fly home from uk for my dads funeral 
Rooms were perfect 
Food was really good 
And the staff were real friendly 
I most defiantly will be back hopefully for a happier occasion ",5,2017,03,15
245,"One night stay, fly out next day.","The hotel is as airport hotels are... dont expect anything extraordinary !
The business room was fine, except the chair, as it was worn out. The bed was good and the room was quiet. The break first was ok. There is a shuttle bus service included. ",3,2017,03,13
245,Great location,"• Hotel is in a great location, very close to the airport. The free shuttle bus in the morning runs every 15 minutes and is extremely handy.
• Check in staff were very helpful, young Asian lad who went above & beyond the call of duty and you could see he genuinely cared. 
• We stayed in a suite, the room was very spacious, clean and had everything you needed. 
• The food is atrocious!! We ordered room service twice and both times it came up cold, and the chicken was very over cooked, tough and dry.
• Breakfast in the morning was really good, couldn't fault it. 

I'm not sure I would stay here again just on the account of the terrible food as we always order room service at every hotel, largely due to the convenience of it. One bad experience is understandable, but both orders were terrible and kind of tells you what you need to know about the kitchen staff.

If however you are looking for a bed for the night close to the hotel, with breakfast in the morning, I would definitely recommend this place.",4,2017,03,11
245,Good Venue,I was here for a conference. The facilities were very good; rooms were excellent; and the catering was top class. The location and parking facilities were really convenient. I would highly recommend it for business meetings or conferences. ,5,2017,03,09
245,Great Airport Location,"Quality hotel. Good bedrooms, good bathroom, good facilities within the room including a Nespresso coffee machine.

Great service at the front desk and nice food in the restaurant.

Walking distance to the departure areas.

Free shuttle bus to and from the airport if you don't want to walk. They say the shuttle bus comes every 15 minutes but the trip from the airport to the hotel is only 3 minutes so, in reality, the shuttle bus arrives at the shuttle bus stop outside the airport every 7 minutes.",4,2017,03,04
245,A quality Airport Hotel.,"We booked in recently after winning a meal out for two in a nearby hostelry. The meal in the nearby restaurant wasn't great, and were delighted at the comfort of having chips in the bar at near 10pm in the Radisson Blu.

The reception, coffee bar and bar area are all very welcoming and hospitable. We noticed that many of the guests were passing through or on flights the next morning. All seating in these areas were comfortable and sleek looking.

Service in the breakfast room was swift and friendly. Reception were very accommodating and nothing seemed like too much of a problem. Bar service was chatty without overstaying their welcome. All staff were well motivated and trained, eager to provide the guest with a comfortable experience.

The room was functional without being ostentatious. The layout of the bathroom was a bit tight, but I know I'm nitpicking here. The entire night stay was a joy and a most enjoyable break for one night with my wife.",4,2017,03,03
245,Very convenient to airport and free shuttle,"I stayed here for one night when I had an early morning flight. It is right in the airport so very convenient. The staff at check-in and check out was very pleasant and efficient. My room was very clean and comfortable. I had breakfast included but it isn't served until 6:30. However, they have coffee, tea, fruit and breakfast bars for early morning travellers. The shuttle runs to the airport every 15 minutes and is free. It takes less than 5 minutes so is very convenient! There is free wifi, a safe in the room and air conditioning. ",4,2017,03,01
245,On the up and up,"Another great stay.

They are refreshing and upgrading this hotel floor by floor from the top down over the past year including new lifts, bedroom facelifts, new entrance revolving doors and lots of other improvements 
The staff and food are magic as always with great variety. There is a free shuttle bus to and from the airport about every 15 mins. Car parking is a reasonable €7.50 a day if you stay and fly.
This hotel is not yet on par with the city center golden lane but it is well on the way.",5,2017,02,28
245,3 strikes and you're out,"This hotel, located in the center of Dublin Airport, about 400 metres from Terminal 2 is frequently used by travellers for early morning and late night incoming flights. Despite the very short distance from Terminal 2 to airport, a journey on foot is not for the fainthearted. I made with journey with a trailing suitcase at about 22.00hrs but a network of roads had to be negotiated without any discernible pedestrian crossing. As the traffic was light at that time I was able to get across but I suspect it might be necessary to take the shuttle bus at other times.                                                                              My stay was a bit disappointing – after a long journey to get there I looked forward to a shower and some TV viewing to unwind. No such luck – TV wasn’t connected properly, and no signal – rather than getting down on my (aching) knees I reported to the switch, and housekeeping sorted it fairly quickly. Meanwhile I found there was no hot water and the pressure wasn’t sufficient to flush the toilet (room was on 1st floor).

 In the USA they say “Three strikes and you’re out” – well I wouldn’t go so far but there was a definite failure to check the functioning of the room.  On the plus side checkin/checkout was efficient and the room was quiet, despite proximity to airport.",3,2017,02,27
245,Perfect weekend away!,"We stayed at the Radisson Dublin airport hotel last year for my birthday with my cousins.
At first we thought the hotel was far from the main town this was down to our own fault. The transport system is very well connected and easily accessible from the hotel. They staff are very friendly, helpful and very welcoming. Great location within close proximity of the hotel perfect for short stay.  You can also save some money if you don't mind the commute to the main part of the town.",5,2017,02,27
245,"Not bad, but not quite there.","Our room was very comfortable and very clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and we had no noise intrusion from anywhere and a good night of sleep ensued. The furnishings were looking quite tired and had numerous bumps and scrapes on them.

The bathroom was clean but needed a good overhaul, there were areas where the grouting had gone mouldy and the enamel chipped from the bath, the loo seat was bolted on but at a jaunty angle. Nothing worth complaining but probably not what you would expect in a hotel of this class and cost.

We took an evening meal in the restaurant and it was decent. Good food, plenty of it and very friendly staff. Mind you, the room key would not let us back into our room so we had to go and wait in a queue back at reception.

The location is excellent, we didn't bother with the courtesy bus and terminal 2 was literally a 5 or 6 minute walk.

This place would be excellent following some refurbishment work but currently is still OK, just looking tired and worn out in places.",4,2017,02,26
245,Radisson should be embarassed,"I know that airport hotels take a beating ... but this is the worst Radisson I have ever stayed in.  Noisy: airplane noise, road noise, hallway noise, room next door noise, bathroom upstairs noise.  The toilet wasn't bolted to the floor and rocked back and forth. The furniture is all banged up.  The smoke detector has a strobe light that belongs in an disco.  The restaurant service was terribly slow and the food mediocre.",1,2017,02,24
245,Clean and nice business hotel,"Very correct and professional service. The Room was nice and big. No minibar, which I found very strange. Breakfast was very nice with a big selection. Price level for a business hotel like this was reasonable.",4,2017,02,22
245,The ICE Hotel Dublin Airport,"No complaints regarding hotel decor or staff, and location is best there is in Dublin Airport, but this hotel is freezing..... Lobby us cold, bar is freezing and rooms weren't much better.... Had to sleep with aircon on all night which I hate due to my asthma. Real pity....",3,2017,02,20
245,One of the best hotels at Dublin Airport,"We usually stay here when flying out of Dublin Airport - and I just had to write a review because I think it's definitely THE best hotel at the Airport . The hotel itself is great , clean comfortable and food is superb.  And wow to the staff - they look after you so well. A big thanks again to the great chef Neil who made the best porridge EVER for me and to Ruta on reception ...lovely smiley girl who was so helpful.  We will be back 😉",5,2017,02,17
245,Not all Radisson Hotels were created equal... ,"Mediocre Quite, room - was upgraded to business class but still only manages to have one easily accessible power socket - and not near the bed - always annoying when you want to charge the phone overnight. Upgrade was to a room with two small beds.... not my personal taste, even when alone

And the kitchen shuts down completely at 10.30pm - (I called room service at exactly 10.30 having arrived late from airport) - they can only prepare cheese and things they can put in the microwave - can't even slice a little smoked salmon from their their recommended offers - 'they don't have the training for that.' Is Radisson killing the Blu brand by attaching it to even mediocre hotels?

",3,2017,02,14
245,The hotel is close to dublin airport,The hotel staff were friendly and helpful  no problem at getting a meal in the evening after i checked in  the room were spacious and well laid out  the breakfast  in the morning  was buffet style  the desk  staff  were very helpful and answered all my questions,5,2017,02,14
245,Regular guest.....standards are slipping,"I use the Radisson regularly for myself and for other guests that I book on behalf of. The rooms are a nice size but very tired. The smell of smoke seems to permeate the entire place also. 

However the standards of room service food has dropped so low over the last year or so. On my last visit, a room service order of Caesar salad and a Margarita pizza was inedible. The dressing on the salad was awful, the pizza was like something from the 80's, cardboard base, rubber cheese and plastic sauce. Its so bad.

It shouldn't be difficult to do some nice food options late at night. Most people are eating before getting up super early, so some nice light salads and fresh dishes would be really good. Instead its a collection of random heavy ""dinners"" and cheesy, greasy fast food options. 

Prices have also increased across the board and customer loyalty is non existent anymore. 

Unfortunately, we've moved out business to the Malton across the way. Rooms are smaller but the food is a million times better.",2,2017,02,14
245,Enjoyable stay,"Stayed at this hotel for three nights earlier this month whilst attending an event at a neighboring hotel. I booked direct with the hotel, and the staff were so friendly on arrival, they even upgraded me to a suite as I'd booked with them directly. I was more than satisfied with this hotel for accommodation, unfortunately I had room service on the last night which was absolutely appalling. It was an unfortunate end to an otherwise great experience.",4,2017,02,12
245,Fantastic,"This s has s our opinion the best hotel near Dublin airport. It is also great for the north side of Dublin and is near the main motorway in to Dublin. So to tell a story. We arrived at the hotel after picking up our car at the airport and walked into reception. The hotel s undergoing some renovation work but we did not find it intrusive. As we had arrived early we had little hope of checking in at 10 in the morning as most hotels had a much later check in time. However the lady on reception was charm itself, not only did she get a room for us we were upgraded to a business room. We then headed in for a buffet breakfast only the truly fussy or picky would have found themselves hungry. The service was excellent the coffe hot and the food yummy. Our room was feeling a little tired around the edges but the renovation process is ongoing so if you can get a room that has been upgraded. Another trick is to get an inny outty car par ticket from reception if you are parking here. The views from the higher rooms are magnificent and you can see the sea! Our praise goes to Niamh on reception as not only did she make our stay easy she gave us a free extension on our check out time to 15.00. She is a rising star and we hope the hotel recognises her ability.",5,2017,02,11
245,Perfect for Early Morning Flight,"Stayed the prior evening to an early am departure.  Staff welcoming upon arrival, room clean and quiet.  Early morning departure using the free shuttle service.  They even had breakfast snacks available to grab before getting on the shuttle.  As always Radisson Blue delivers a nice hotel.  Thank you!",5,2017,02,09
245,Nice convenient hotel,"When you need to stay at Dublin Airport to catch an early flight, this hotel is ideal. Very convenient, easy walking distance to the terminal, but shuttle bus is available. Rooms were large and comfortable, breakfast, buffet style, was perfectly acceptable.",4,2017,02,07
245,Smooth sailing ,"Stayed one night outbound. Check-in was fast and I was upgraded to a Business room because of membership in their points club.  The room was large and comfortable, clean, with a refrigerator.  Check-out was no problem, even though I asked for separate receipts for room and food. The shuttle to the terminal was on time and the driver carried my bags for me. Could not have had a nicer stay.",5,2017,02,05
245,Time warp,I had dinner in the T3 lounge yesterday. The food was fine and the service was good. The problem arose as I had a leisurely coffee.  I did not realise the clock in the lounge was 15 minutes slow.  This is not acceptable in an airport hotel.,3,2017,02,05
245,Convenient Hotel within Walking distance from Airport,"Nice modern hotel close to the Dublin Airport. We walked with our bags to the hotel. They also provide a free shuttle service back and forth to airport. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The elevators up to the rooms are secured with your key card. They provide a very decent breakfast as well, which you can get separately or included with room rate. Hot Irish Breakfast option along with a continental type breakfast bar with lots of options including cheese, smoked salmon, croissants, breads, fruit, yogurt, cereal and granola.",4,2017,02,02
245,Mixed opinions! ,"My boyfriend was coming to spend New Year with me in Ireland and his flight was delayed from the UK and told me to book this room last minute. For last minute, the rate for room and breakfast was very good. However, major cracks showed in service. 

Generally, the hotel is decorated well and is clean. The room we were assigned a business room, so maybe larger than normal - with writing desk etc but the bed was comfy and good shower pressure. Lovely room. There were many flights grounded and missed connections the night we stayed so it was extremely busy, but an airport hotel should also have an 'encase of' plan and or staff. 

There was a small wait to check - in but the transfer from the terminal was very convenient. After I dumped my bags in my room, I decided I'd have dinner in the bar. When I entered, it was busy but there were still empty tables but nobody assisted me. 

I then decided I'd have room service as I didn't fancy eating on my own and my phone needed to be charged, so I could keep updated on my boyfriends flight. 

On return to my room, I spent a half an hour trying to use the hotel phone to order room service. In the end I had to use my mobile to ring reception to be put through and place my order. 30/40mins I was told. So I decided to have a shower.

45mins pass and still no food - I give benefit of the doubt because it was obviously busier than expected. 

1hour passes, still no food. Try to use hotel phone to call down. Once again, no joy.

1.5 hours later, I use my mobile once again to contact reception to be put through. 

When then they claim I didn't make any order. Now I know I was hungry but I was imagining placing an order. I was asked who I speaking to, now I don't know about you but I'm not always inclined to remember the name of my waiter - but I will be from now on. 

I then have to re-order my food. 10mins later, its with me in my room. Now the waiter did (finally) admit it was the fault of the kitchen etc and my dinner was given free of charge. However, at that and allowing for the travel from the kitchen to my room. The chips were cold and the burger bun was a small bit on the stale side. 

My boyfriends flight finally arrived, very late and I was transferred over to meet him and we got transferred back on the bus service. EXCELLENT SERVICE! 

The next morning, the breakfast had good selection and the staff seemed friendly. However, there was definitely an atmosphere of we are managing because we weren't expecting these numbers before last night.!

And, once again the saving grace of the whole experience was the bus service. The driver kindly dropped us to Hertz rather than back to the terminal to transfer again. EXCELLENT SERVICE! ",3,2017,02,01
245,Night away,"Nice hotel ideally situated at Dublin airport.

Would recommend and will stay here again.  ",5,2017,01,29
245,Best Airport hotel experience ,"From check in with Kate to fabulous Junior Suite on the 5th floor to the most amazingly attentive waitress(Dagmar) in the restaurant it's really a 5* review all round 
Very reasonably priced menu and presentation of food - superb 
All in all 
Not your average airport hotel 
Will never stay anywhere but here when flying out of Dublin 
Bravo Radisson !!!! ",5,2017,01,28
245,Good Experience,"Stayed for one night on outbound and return flight nights. Upgraded on both visits to
Business class. Desk staff very welcoming and efficient dealt with any questions well.
All staff we encountered in bar/restaurant very helpful. Enjoyed both stays.",4,2017,01,21
245,In renovation,Airport signage to arrive at the bus shuttle were very poor so ended up walking all around the airport to at final go back on my step to find the shuttle. Hotel staff is nice and helpful. Room clean and restaurant food ok. Decoration basic. Hotel was renovating the corridors... thats only bemol so far.,3,2017,01,18
245,Wonderful location for  early airport check in ,Perfect location for dublin airport ideal for our early check in dublin airport the hotel is reasonably price excellent location parking on site friendly team working away large hotel with alot of little extras pc station charger station weigh your bag etc our room was clean modern and welcoming a little personal welcome note and chocolates breakfast presented in a buffet with ample choice  ,5,2017,01,16
245,It's fine- but no more than fine.,"Oh, it's OK, just rather ordinary.
The reception was OK, it was clean but just very average.
I was upgraded to a suite which was very large with a very small bathroom but I couldn't get the heating to work- a problem shared by my colleagues! 
WiFi was good, dinner was bland (difficult to do to a curry) and breakfast was nothing special.
Fine for a stay before an early flight, but no more than that.",3,2017,01,15
245,Standard,"Fairly average, standard nondescript hotel.  Rooms are fine, if uninteresting.  Standard of food is poor.  I had a bland thai green curry.  Waiter asked if I wanted to charge it to the room, but turned out that as I had prepaid the room I wasn't able to do that, so I got a rather terse demand to return immediately to the restaurant to pay which didn't impress me much - not a word of apology about it either.",3,2017,01,14
245,Terrible hotel ,"Stayed here midweek as my son was getting an early flight 3am next morning as I'm a  club Carlson member I got an upgrade to a business class room what a big disappointment I've stayed in Manchester Radisson and Dublin Radisson Blu hotels and cannot say enough on how good they were .
Check in was fine on way to my room on 3rd floor stains on the carpet but when I got into room still stains on carpet and in the bathroom the edging around the bath tub was brown and we only had 1 bath towel between us thought there should've been a seperate shower.
Checking out next morning one of the receptionist couldn't have been any more unpleasant if she tried not to myself but to an old lady that when at the desk was taking a phone call and strayed behind the desk into the receptionist territory and she held up her hand and said please madam as if to say don't cross the line so disrespectful.
I like Radisson Blu hotels but won't be staying in the Radisson Blu Dublin airport again 😤😤",2,2017,01,14
245,"Best hotel, close to airport","As we fly both in and out of Dublin airport at least twice a year we can make direct comparisons with the other hotels close to the airport . In my opinion this is the best . Very friendly and warm welcome , the staff are simply really friendly and present .
The bar , restaurant and cafe area are very comfortable and we particularly like the fact that my child could eat for free when I had dinner. 
The shuttle bus is regular , every 15 minutes or so. 
Breakfast selection is excellent with really good coffee from a machine . 
All in all , we're done with the other hotels in the vicinity ( we've tried all with free shuttle bus service ) and the raddison is our go to at Dublin airport .",5,2017,01,11
245,Not the best airport hotel in area. ,"When you arrive the reception gives the idea of a high standard hotel. Unfortunately when you get in the lift this stops. 
Rooms are basic, bathroom was like something you expect from a cheap budget ibis. 

Towels were hard, noise from neighbours plumbing in shower woke us.  

We had an early flight and had to be up at 3am. This meant cold shower as there was no hot water.  

Good location to the airport. 

More 3 star than 4 star. Obviously the high turnover of  guests has taken its effect of the hotel. ",3,2017,01,05
245,Overnight Stay,"This was a nice & friendly hotel.
Today it is extremely shabby, rundown . Carpet torn on hallways . Walls scratched up .It does not come close to what is expected in a Radisson
Can't even get sandwiches in in-room dining at night.",1,2017,01,03
245,Every time I fly,"I am in and out of Dublin every two weeks and always choose to stay at the Radisson.  Very friendly, great staff, comfortable rooms and good deals to be had if you plan.

Very convenient for the airport with a free bus which passes both terminals every 15 minutes.",5,2017,01,03
245,Good Hotel Next to Dublin Airport,"The Radisson Blu Dublin Airport is one of the few hotels in the vicinity of the airport, featuring modern interiors and cosy rooms. Staff were all friendly and nice, although more attention is needed during breakfast since service was not constant. Food at breakfast and at the T3 restaurant at dinner was always very good and nicely presented. Although the location is great for those in transit or wanting to spend the first/last night close to the airport, I do not recommend this hotel to those planning to spend most of their holiday visiting the Dublin city centre attractions and nearby towns. We happened to be staying here during a period when busses and public transport were on strike, therefore it was a hassle to figure out how to get to the city every day without breaking the bank. The hotel does offer a very good shuttle service to the hotel free of charge which runs every 10/15mins.",3,2017,01,03
245,Breakfast let this place down badly,"Myself and my partner stayed here for 2 nights over the New Years Eve weekend for an exceptionally good last minute deal. Our room was massive, as was the bed, and spotless clean. We had plenty of hot water, toiletries and top notch coffee/tea facilities. The WiFi is also very good. The hotel has been around a long long time but to be honest you can't tell. The public areas of the hotel are beautiful and the rooms have been very well maintained. It is a quiet hotel and the reception staff are very nice and efficient. The bar is nice, as are the staff, and for a hotel of this type I think the prices of everything are quite reasonable. The parking has to be paid for which is a bit of a surprise. It's a good 30 minutes into town by bus but the stop is a 30 secnd walk from the hotel and it's very cheap. It's a 5 minute walk to the airport and they have a shuttle bus. The only let down, and a bad let down, was the breakfast. On our first morning we got it brought to the room. Not only did they get almost everything I ordered wrong - no tea, only coffee, stuff missing off the hot breakfast, no grapefruit juice - the hot food was stone cold and barely edible, the apples were well past their best, the fruit salad was swimming in juice and obviously the dregs from the bowl. The only decent thing were the 2 croissants that I never even asked for. The second morning we went down to the buffet hoping for much better. It was ok, nothing special. The hot food was at least hot and the toast was actually toast, not warm bread. The pastries were nice and fresh. Bottom line is, taking breakfast out of the equation, this is an excellent hotel. My recommendation is get room only and get your breakfast elsewhere!",3,2017,01,01
245,Disgracefully rude staff,"Our early morning flight was cancelled and had to wait almost 8hrs for another so decided to check in for a few hours sleep. The most ignorant, condescending and rude staff member, Ruda, was at the check in desk. My phone battery was so low and the charger was in my checked in luggage so I asked for a loan of one for a few hours under the circumstances. The response I got was disgraceful. This is meant to be the hospitality trade. She insinuated it would go missing. I was about to pay €100 for a room for only a few hours, I was hardly going to take the charger with me, it was purely to give my phone some charge due to the flight being cancelled. She has to be the most ignorant person I've ever encountered and I have stayed in a lot of hotels worldwide so I told her to cancel the transaction due to her terrible attitude. We walked across the road to the Maldron where we were greeted by such lovely staff, one of which gave me a loan of a charger, no problem at all. Plus it was cheaper. I will never stay in any Radisson again unless their staff get a refresher course in hospitality. ",1,2016,12,30
245,Radisson Blu-es,"My wife and I had been looking forward to staying at this hotel-the nearest one to the airport terminals-for some time and our recent trip to Ireland to meet up with our family gave us the excuse to try it out.

I must say we were extremely disappointed for the following reasons-

The room itself (not cheap at 105 euro for one night) was pretty standard but the pillows smelled of smoke, we were given only one large towel (to share?) and we had a very poor sleep experience because of the sub-standard noise insulation.

We were brought by car to the hotel by our son and his family who then joined us for a meal in the T3 restaurant. The service in the restaurant was abysmal with a very long wait experienced for starter and main courses and the food, when it finally did arrive, was poor standard-especially the ""Taste of Thai"" chicken dish. When the bill arrived it was incorrect  and it took two attempts to get it right-""the new system"" being blamed for the errors (it was staff shortages in the restaurant which supposedly accounted for our long wait!) 
To add insult to injury when I tried to get the parking ticket validated for our son to use (free parking for residents) I was told that as they were ""guests"" and not residents, they had to pay 10 euros (this, despite the fact that I had just spent over 200 euros in the restaurant for the meal for 6 of us!)
On checking out we found that the shuttle bus to the terminal was so small that we had to wait for it to drop-off and then return for us.
We wont be using this hotel in future but will choose one of the many which are just a couple of extra minutes-but a world away in terms of standards-from the terminals.",2,2016,12,29
245,Good Choice for Early Flight next morning,"Hotel is not quite walking distance from the airport due to the way that the airport roads are put together, but the hotel offers a free, fast and convenient shuttle to both terminals. The front desk staff were very helpful indeed and I had a large and comfortable room.  A good restaurant and bar in the hotel meant I could get decent sleep before a very early rise.",4,2016,12,25
245,Family,"OK lets start by at the lobby.

Walking into the lobby it was very nicely lit.
The Christmas tree filled the lobby.
I loved the world clocks.

The front desk staff.....

The staff are very professional and very polite.

The shuttle driver was on the ball and very professional well done Pat.

The room.....

My son gives the single bed 7/10 he like his own bed.

The double Bed.....

Very comfortable and clean only one pillow...gulp... but the joy of finding extras in the wardrobe.

The room is very clean and tidy but the flush in 109 needs fixing instead of having to yank the handle to get it to work.

The Bathroom...
Very clean 

Would stay again maybe, is it worth 97 euro no!!!!! 75_80 euro maybe.

I am disappointed........ a little, but its not the worst but I moaned and  moaned to stay here and I didnt feel exclusive like you would expect from the Radisson.

 ",4,2016,12,24
245,Ok....wish I had a better word to describe it...but I don't ,"We stayed for an overnight for a connecting flight and it was ok....I can't say much more, I wish I could, but it wasn't great and it wasn't rubbish. The room was functional..and I got a reasonable nights sleep.

Although what I can say is it felt expensive the room was £75.00 and dinner that consisted of 4 drinks and 2 burgers and chips was £50....so for what it was it felt expensive to me.

The shuttle to the airport was very good though...don't waste money on a taxi, the shuttle service was great. The service in the bar/restaurant was good...and the check in desk was also good. 

It's not the staff...they're great..just average elsewhere ",3,2016,12,19
245,Sorry but just not good enough,"Radisson Blu is what I would happily describe as my preferred brand and therefore the expectations were met.

I arrived from motorway and did not find the hotel easily. In fact I was facing the building before I realised that I had arrived. Check in, room, bathroom all fine.  My wife and I were not ready to dine but we did wish to relax in bar area before eating. We were told by restaurant manager that tables were for diners only and that we could only sit on a stool at bar. This was not relaxing.

Sleep was then impossible because the room overlooked smoking area and the smokers were talking loudly until the early hours.

We were leaving early to board flight and we're informed that a light continental buffet was provided in foyer. No one could direct us to the facilties,  we eventually gave up and left vowing never to use this hotel again.",3,2016,12,17
245,Met expectations,"Very close to the terminals- I imagine if you arrive into terminal 2, the hotel is closer than the bus stop- Shame it's not signposted. The bus is a VW caravan, with seats for 8 only. This could have been a problem in the morning but when I complained that the bus was full, they brought a second one into action. The hotel was full of signs apologising for the appearance due to redecoration- looks like they are keeping ahead of the curve on this.

Room was pleasant but sound insulation could be better. Bed was supremely comfortable. I left too early for breakfast.",4,2016,12,11
245,CHRISTMAS PARTY 80'S NIGHT,Attended this event last night with approx 30 work colleagues.  Food - service - entertainment - atmosphere - excellent - best Christmas Party event I have ever attended - well done to all the staff who worked so hard - were very professional and made sure it was a great night !  ,5,2016,12,10
245,short stay,"Hotel very convenient to the airport with good shuttle service. Room was not very good.  
toilet did not flush and fridge empty. Room expensive for what it was. All in all a bit dissapointing. I will not be back.",3,2016,12,08
245,Comfortable hotel right in the airport,"The hotel is right beside the terminals and is about the best of the hotels situated in the airport complex. The hotel is a little bit tatty and can be expensive - especially during peak travel times. Food is so-so.
This is not the best Radisson-blu and could do with having some money spent on it.",4,2016,12,03
245,Broken promise at front desk,Phoned  front desk today to check reservation for tonight 1/12/2016 asked about parking was told first night was free and would make note on system. .When I arrived was told was hospital policy was always to charge and were so awful and aggressive  left repeating the same line we always charge  the manager was no better  I am stuck at this hotel till tomorrow at a conference  can't wait to leave !!,1,2016,12,01
245,Business,Visited the Radisson for a business meeting.  Venue looked great with good coffee and good wifi.  Staff were attentive but lacked the personal touch.  Dodd served on time and was quiet good.  Only issue was parking space.  All in all we'll run business hotel,4,2016,12,01
245,perfect location,"my wife and i stayed here in early october. After landing in Dublin Airport  we were delighted to find a free shuttle bus to the hotel.
However one doesnt really need the bus as the hotel is just a short walking distance.
Checking in was efficient and friendly and we were pleasently surprised with our allocated room which was big and airy.
slippers and robes were provided for our use and the room had a wonderful tea and coffee making facilities including a nespresso machine and  biscuits.
the bathroom was large and had a exceptional shower.
we dined in the bar that night , the food was good but a little pricey'
after a good nights sleep the shuttle bus was at the door at 6am to
get us on our forward journey.
staying here certainly takes the stress out of flying from Dublin",4,2016,11,30
245,"Amazing staff, older hotel...","Well, after a disastrous day of travel, (we were going to America, through Zürich, somehow ended up in Dublin... yeah, don't ask me how...) we needed a place to sleep, and the choice was between two hotels: some random one, and this one. We chose the Radisson Blu, because we stayed in one before, and we know the brand. The hallways of the hotel are a bit dated, but that is fine... As long as the room is okay. Speaking of which, the room was dated, and not the room cleanliness was ok. Upon arrival in the room, (check-in was a breeze, we didn't have  a reservation) we noticed that the door to the bathroom had a hair on it 😐, the bathtub had a towel in it (a dirty one I presume). We came downstairs, and we told the people at the front desk about it, and they were very apologetic. Oh, and I forgot to add, the toilet in our room at least required to pump the flushing handle in order to get it to flush. Anyway, we took a walk to the airport to have some dinner. They do have a shuttle bus service, but it is so close, it doesn't really make life too difficult. We came back to our room, and we found some chocolate, we were offered free dessert, and free drinks at the bar! How nice! We were even offered dessert!!! For free!!!!!!!!!! They left us a really heartwarming note, and fresh towels. (Pro tip: if you have a problem with your room, no matter how minor, complain. It makes life better. The beds in the room were nothing special, and not all of the beds had headboards in my room (there were two beds in the room), and the night was fairly routine. Anyway, that's all from me. Until next time!

Happy Traveling,

Alek",3,2016,11,27
245,Beautiful start or finish to a trip,"Stayed here after a late flight. Check in staff were very pleasant and on a wintry dark wet evening they made me very welcome- I was even offered an upgrade which was a wonderful surprise the room was spacious, spotless and very comfortable. 

Breakfast the next morning was your usual self service buffet. Room was very pleasant and staff helpful. 

A lovely stepping stone to begin or finish your trip.",4,2016,11,21
245,DID THE BOSSES AT RADISSON LOSE INTEREST HERE?,"When I stay in Radisson Blu hotels, I (as most people) expect the usual high standards and comfort of this worldwide brand.  I forked out the extra EURO to stay at this branded hotel, knowing that there are cheaper choices around the same area. These are my thoughts:

POSITIVE POINTS:
Reception staff is friendly enough, and check in / check out was a breeze. I like the fact that you need to swipe your card to access the elevator, which adds to a sense of security.

The room is a decent size, and the bed is comfortable, allowing for a decent sleep. There is a small pillow choice (one hard… one soft), and I admit that I found one to my liking. Being across from the airport, one could think that noise is an issue. Pleased to report that the soundproofing in the hotel is fantastic. 

The bathroom is on the smaller side, but good enough to do the job it has to do. Shower experience is OK, with good water pressure, and a consistent balance of hot/cold that allows for a relaxing shower.

Internet is free, and works really well, which is always a plus in my books. I also very much appreciate a spacious and separate work station, and this is a positive.

Location is perfect… just across from the airport. 10 minutes’ walk, if you want to venture… or there is a free realizable shuttle that does the job perfectly. Very friendly driver.

The bar area is nice, and a pleasure to spend time in. Good service, I must say.

NEGATIVE POINTS:
Lunch quality was reasonable, but the staff had very little clue about what  they were doing… getting orders mixed up, confusing themselves with who does what. I do not blame the staff… I blame the management, since attention to this needs to be taken.

Feeling in the room is disappointing, since the furniture looks and feels cheap and overtaken by time. Not up to spec with the standards of Radisson Blu. Below the cheap Ikea standards, to be fair. This is the Radisson Blu, expected much more.

Food in the restaurant is barbarously expensive. I know that there are no real options for good food nearby, but to charge 15 euro for a pizza… is really too much, for a pizza that is under Domino’s standards. Wine is outrageous in pricing as well.

I like a gym in the hotel... they provide a serviice to a local gym. Lost interest in taking the shuttle to the gym, and disappointed in the fact that there is no onsite workout place.

SUMMING UP:
For a Radisson Blu, I felt that the standards are far below the usual that you would expect. Price is the same as you will get all over the world, but as mentioned, the standards are not up to ”par” for this brand. 

Management… DO SOMETHING,,, else you will lose customers, like you lost me in Dublin.",3,2016,11,19
245,Fantastic,My stay in Radisson Blu Dublin Airport was fantastic. Staff were so helpful - nothing was a problem and I was greeted with a smile and a friendly Hello wherever I went. I was there for a business conference and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Thank you to all the people who made it so enjoyable.,5,2016,11,18
245,Top hotel!,"Stayed here after my flight to Dublin lovely hotel, staff were great even upgraded are room to a business room. The room was spacious, big bathroom everything you could want. Get location walking distance from the airport.",5,2016,11,15
245,Great rooms but expensive,"Thanks for having a vacancy and the upgrade to a business room. Getting a hotel room on short notice in Dublin can be difficult at times. Well located near the airport but you have to pay for car parking??. Nice bar area and food on the menu was above average. Meet fellow travellers fro America over a few drinks. Staff were attentive and pleasant. At circa 200 euro a night Not cheap. 

Only complaint was the pre booking fee of 220 euro took over 10 days to be cleared from my account after I paid for the room. Could do better tan that I am sure.",4,2016,11,14
245,Nice Room - Adequate for Close to Airport,"The room itself was extremely clean, large and nice.  The hotel was also quite lovely.  It was great for one night before leaving Ireland.  It is in the airport area, however, so not a place to stay unless you want to be close for your flight.",4,2016,11,12
245,Flies in my Guinness beer,"We chose this location for a two-Day business meeting the next day at Ryanair in Swords.
It's really close by (10 - 15 minutes).

Request for non-smoking room for two nights, but we can smell the smoke from the carpet. After that we changed our room, from 305 in 303.
That room was dated but clean.

Rooms are too cold also! Try to fix it with the temperature control, but it doesn't help. Brrrr

Good food in the restaurant, but there were a lot of flies all over the restaurant, and after a while also in my Guinness beer.

The very nice waiter gives us a new beer and a different table, but the flies are everywhere. Disgusting!

Nice staff, but overall the hotel is not worth the money.",2,2016,11,11
245,Needs Improvement,"This hotel is conveniently located near the Dublin airport, but that is all that can recommend it.  As Club Carlson Gold members, we are usually upgraded to a business room and given an in-room amenity, but we were not offered either upon check-in.   When we inquired, we were told business rooms were sold out.  Upon entering our room, we found our bed type and room location requests were not honored and our room was in need of refurbishment.  We went back to the desk and spoke to another desk agent who was miraculously able to find us a business room with the bed type and location we wanted after we expressed our unhappiness.  Thankfully he made things right, but our initial experience left us with a dim view of this hotel's customer service and treatment of loyal Club Carlson elite members.",2,2016,11,09
245,Ok stay before flight,"We stayed here before catching a flight in the morning. The hotel is fine for just one night, but needs an update on its rooms, especially bathrooms! The room felt very dated and the toilet/bathroom was in a desperate need of new tiles, tubs, sink and taps. The bed was comfortable with clean white sheets. Our room was quiet and our stay was ok. We also ordered room service and our pizza was missing a lot of the toppings it said on the menu so that was a bit disappointing. The breakfast was good but the layout of it was a bit messy and confusing. Staff was friendly, but failed to clear our table of dirty dishes even though it wasn't too busy at all.",3,2016,11,09
245,Very Enjoyable Stay!,"My family and I (five double rooms!) stayed at this hotel for two nights in October. As there was a family celebration at the hotel, we didn't actually select the hotel and, to be honest, I was a little concerned due to some of the comments in other reviews.

But it turned out to be a very nice hotel ... and very handy close to be airport. Despite the free shuttle we decided to walk, rolling our cases behind us.

The only problem during the stay was trying to get some taxis to bring us to other locations. Although the reception was happy to request taxis for us, they took ages to come. The most annoying part was the fact that there were hundreds of taxis flying past the hotel entrance bound for the airport terminal. After 20 minutes of waiting I don't know what stopped me running out into the middle of the street to stop one of them ... but then I probably wouldn't be around to write this review ;-)",5,2016,11,08
245,Just Ok,We stayed here as we were catching a flight the next day.  It was Ok.  The food menu was not the greatest and check in and check out could have been a little smoother. I did like the fact that there was a free shuttle to the airport.,3,2016,11,07
245,Overnight stay,"Excellent, friendly staff and comfortable rooms.Also very handy for access to airport terminals. Could not fault anything.Could not hear anything from plane landings and takeoffs. Great sleeping and food.",4,2016,11,07
245,Overnight stay,The Radisson is very well located for anyone flying from Dublin airport. It takes less than 5 mins to get to the terminals and the shuttle service is regular.  Rooms are nice and hotel is quiet. Ideal overnight location for an early morning flight. Staff are friendly and helpful.,4,2016,11,07
245,I can't believe this is a Radisson Blu Hotel,"I stayed at the Airport Radisson Blu Hotel for two nights. Once before going on holiday and on the night I returned.
On the first night we arrived to find a rather tired hotel that doesn't resemble any other Radisson that I have stayed at. The decor was plain and lacked any style.
At first I thought is this typical of an Airport hotel but remembered the Radisson at London Stanstead which is stunning.
The room was very plain even though we had upgraded to a business room. I think the up grade proved you with a dressing gown and coffee machine. Not worth an extra €40.
The Quilt on the bed was wafer thin, the radiator in the room was stone cold and I found out later it didn't work. You were supposed to use the Aircon to heat the room.
Decoration was plain, drab and the bathroom was dirty around the bath screen and there was patches of black mound on the grouting. 
There was a wafer thin quilt on the bed and no other extra bedding provided. 
I woke at 4am totally frozen and had to use the dressing gown for extra warmth.
The Breakfast was disappointing. Although there was a selection of cold and hot food the fruit looked old. There was water melon but it looked like it had the flesh removed and they were serving the skin. The dining room was drab and dull and like something from the yester years.
I commented on the cold room, radiator not working and thin quilt and was told I should have used the Aircon. Why would you try and turn on an Aircon when there is a radiator in the room.
The return journey we arrived late. Asked for extra bedding and again told use the air-con was hot air up to 28C.  I said I would also like extra bedding which was provided. This time the quilt was much thicker so it was obvious they had changed them from a summer to a winter duvet that weekend. 
There was the same issue with the bathroom. It could have been cleaner and there was mould in the grouting. There was a lot of early morning noise coming from vehicles outside delivering to the hotel and hammering started a 8 am from a man working in the bin area. Then there was endless noise from the corridor. 
The photos show the chaos on the bedroom corridor leve 3.
I certainly can't recommend this hotel. It was the worst stay ever and certainly not worth the money..",1,2016,11,05
245,very good for an airport hotel,"stayed here overnight as had an early morning flight 
rooms are a good size and comfortable and clean staff were friendly and helpful
we also had dinner here 
unfortunately when we went to order the striploin steak the were out of them (pity)
food was good but they need to improve there choice on the menu  
the wines on offer are a bit steep in price",4,2016,11,04
245,Convenient before flying out,Always stay here whenever I have an early morning flight. Rooms are spacious & comfortable. The park & stay option is economical when you consider the convenience factor of taking the courtesy shuttle bus to the terminal - runs every 15 mins. Certainly easier & usually cheaper than hiking in from the outlying airport car parks,4,2016,11,03
245,An excellent stay near the airport,"I have stayed here before when a flight was cancelled to London, it's a great hotel, very comfortable with a good breakfast. It's a bit pricey, but very convenient if you have an early flight out of Dublin Airport. As my flight was delayed, I was able to spend a little more time at the hotel, a great place.",5,2016,11,02
245,Radisson BLU Dublin Airport,Excellent stop for an early flight. Easily accessible from both North and south of the country. I would recommend the restaurant for a good meal and I would definitely stay in the Radisson Blu hotel at Dublin Airport again.,5,2016,11,02
245,Fine for an airport hotel,"Just an average airport hotel really.  Rooms tastefully decorated with all amenities on hand.  Looking a bit tired and could do with a bit of a makeover but this doesn't affect the stay.

One point to mention, which I hope is passed on, is that the poor reception staff have to deal with both face to face arrivals and incoming phonecalls which makes them extremely busy especially when there are people waiting in the foyer to be attended to.  This is a poor first experience, there should be separate office staff dealing with phone calls.  The girl who served us did apologise, and it was no fault of her's, but this is something which management need to consider.  We had the same problem during check-out too - it doesn't work to operate in this way.

Meal was fine, service good.  A good night's sleep until a group of men arrived in the early hours and woke probably the whole floor up with their noise.  Again, this is no fault of the hotel but just down to some rude and thoughtless guests.

Excellent for the airport, you don't need to bother using the bus link if you're happy to walk about 10 minutes to the venue.",3,2016,11,01
245,Great airport Hotel,"stayed only one night before my early flight, check in was very quick and easy, staffs were quite helpful, my room was spacious actually, more than enough space for family although it was only for me. Had a good sleep, and they provide some free simple breakfast to grab before off to airport, very convenient, perfect for traveller who always on the go. the hotel also provide free shuttle bus to airport which only takes like 3 minutes ride from the hotel",4,2016,11,01
245,"Great style, Great sleep ","Had an early flight so booked into Radisson at the Airport.  Modern well maintained hotel. Pleasant and efficient staff. I was assigned a business room which was very comfortable and had one of the more functional desks to work at that I have experienced in a hotel.  Good strong WiFi too.  Surprisingly I could not really hear flights coming and going to any disruptive extent - must be good sound insulation.   The bed and pillows were really very comfortable and led to a great sleep.  I ate my evening meal in the lounge/bar and was very pleased.  My early start meant I could not take breakfast, however free tea/coffee and fruit was laid on in the lobby for the early commuters.  Nice touch.  My room price included 3 days free parking and free shuttle bus to and from the terminals - very good package.  Highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2016,10,28
245,Best of the selection at the airport,"I have stayed here a number of times - and will do so again.

There are a number of hotels at the airport  - and some that claim to be but need a good taxi ride so watch out.

This one is walking distance to Terminal 2 (but need to cross a busy road - there is a crossing and it is better to use it!) - indeed Terminal 1 is only a couple of minutes further on.  There is a complimentary shuttle bus but honestly, if you are reasonably fit and without too much luggage the walk is just as quick unless there is a bus just about to leave.

There is hot coffee, fruit etc in the reception area when checking out, so if you are too early for breakfast you can ""grab and go"".",4,2016,10,28
245,Early flyer,"I've stayed in the Radisson Dublin airport with the family and had a very early flight. The staff were very nice, hotel was spottless and room was perfect. Had an early wake up call and and breakfast on the go. It was all very easy going. 24 hour shuttle bus to the terminal. I will be staying again. Nice to find and place that is easy going and   everything is though of.",5,2016,10,27
245,Looking for a room with stained furniture? You are in luck!,"We were in a business class room on a layover on the way home. On the way down the hall, we noticed majorly ripped carpet. Got to the room and two chairs were stained (one a rather gross red/brown stain and I'm not going to get into further detail than that You're welcome!) Then the bed had one of those covers that is over the bottom area... three whitish stains on that. Gross. Inspected the bed and sheets were white and seemed clean and it was a quick one-night layover so we stayed. Another note is that we were asked if we wanted to pay for the Super Breakfast Buffet, which I can now see from the hotel description maybe should have been included in the price. Overall? For our first time staying at a Radisson? Next time, if we are looking for a chain, we'll stick with Hilton or Marriott. Maybe even Super8 would be better!!

Oh, for the pros: very close to the airport and free wireless. Keeps your mind off stains.",1,2016,10,25
245,Sometimes the Customer  can be wrong ...............,"I am a bit late with this review sorry, my partner and myself  stayed in the ""Blu"" and we got excellent service after very difficult flight. We were returning from Sunny Spain and not for FIRST TIME our Aer Lingus flight  was delayed by 3 half hours so by the time we arrived in Dublin ,to make long story short , I rang  the BLU to tell them we had arrived and we were waiting outside the Airport arrivals but sadly the driver could not find us and I made a number of angry telephone calls to a gentleman at the reception asking what the hell was going on , this was at 4:o'clock in the morning I was very tired,angry  etc  and I have to be honest I was not very not nice on the phone well anyway the driver eventually found us and he brought to the Hotel and to be honest I did not expect a warm welcome at Reception after ""balling out"" the poor guy but that's what I got - a very warm and concerning welcome . I felt like a worm , especially when I found out we were standing in the wrong place(not totally my fault) .Well after all that the Blu Hotel is a great hotel--  beds, food, the staff etc is simply excellent .Gripes just one-- I know I sound like a broken record  like everything else in Ireland  the RADISSON does not come cheap sadly.",5,2016,10,25
245,Good but expensive for the service,"I stayed because of a flight delay and the beds are confortable, the hotel is within walking distance from the t2 (they also have a shuttle free of charge). Convenient but pricey. The food in the restaurant for dinner was ok nothing special, expensive though. ",3,2016,10,22
245,A Blu by the airport,"Stayed at the Raddison Blu on the eve of a flight out of Dublin - a great location so close to the airport with onsite parking. The real asset of this hotel is its location to Dublin airport and handy to the airport car hire outlets for pickup and return.
The rooms are clean and tidy for an older hotel but it still worked for me.",3,2016,10,21
245,Layover stay-satisfactory,"Shuttle bus very small so has to make multiple trips when many travelers arriving at same time from airport. 10 of us (10 parties) in line at check-in at midnight! Front desk personnel friendly, nice security at elevator (must use room key o access elevator). Room service disappointed me because they never answered phone. We had to trek outside at 1am and dine at nearby 24-hr McDonald's! Nice breakfast place in hotel. Hotel room dated and had odd hard-to-operate shower! I had to use hand-held shower sprayer because I could not figure out how to turn on shower head?? All in all satisfactory for a layover stay but that's about it.  Refrigerator in-room by the way. ",3,2016,10,21
245,Excellent,"We booked this hotel on a Saturday night as it was near the airport and we were flying out on Sunday morning.  The room was great.  It was so comfortable compared to some of the other rooms we had stayed in during our trip.  We paid extra for the breakfast but it was well worth it.  The food was great.  The hotel provided a shuttle to the hotel from the airport as well as to the airport.  One thing we never figured out was how to get the main shower head to work.  The portable sprayer worked but got water all over the sink and floor.  Also, every 2 or 3 minutes, I was hit with a burst of scalding hot water.  Not sure what that was about.  It was a quiet, comfortable room.",5,2016,10,18
245,Excellent Customer Relations,We are reasonably regulars here and always enjoy the experience. On an extremely busy night with an unexpected group from a flight cancellation our room service meal arrived late having been kept hot and was very poor. However on checking out we were upgraded for or next booking which was appreciated. Unlike Geneva Airport when things went somewhat awry there was an immediate effort to correct same.,5,2016,10,18
245,Easy check in and easy access to the airport,"The parking is 12.50 Euros per night. You can drop your rental at the airport and take a free shuttle back if you don't want to pay. Wifi is free And fast. Breakfast is 11 Euros if booked at check in, otherwise price is 15 Euros.

The staff upgraded us to a business class room without asking as we mentioned using Radisson frequently. The difference is having a loveseat in the room and coffee table...a nice feature if you have been on the road a bit.

One thing noticeable is the windows do not block airport noise. If quiet is important ask for a room on the opposite side of the hotel. Kids may like watching the planes take off.",4,2016,10,17
245,Excellent Location - Good Hotel !,"Good room, good bathroom. 
Very clean and carpeted. Clean towels and napkins and utility provided. 
Location is excellent walking distance from Airport. They also have free shuttle service every 15 minutes outside Terminal 1 from Zone 8 (Bus Departure). 
There was Tea and coffee making machine in the room. 
The Shuttle driver was very nice and he helped in lifting the luggage both the times. 
But there was no one at the reception to take the bags in the room - I mean the Valet. Thats what i didnt like about the Hotel.",4,2016,10,17
245,Enjoyed Every Minute of My Stay,"All was just great and wonderful. Staff, delicious (and not so expensive) breakfasts, location by airport terminals and what was the most vital for me: complete quietness, I was sleeping like a baby in total silence.
The only minor nuance is that the hotel is quite old but it's no problem.",5,2016,10,16
245,Highly recommended if you have an early flight.,"We decided to stay here overnight because we had an early flight from Dublin. We were able to check in to Aer Lingus, including our bags when we arrived at the airport, and then walk 5 minutes from the airport terminal to the hotel where we had a nice dinner in the restaurant.  Our room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. The 5am departure was well organised by the hotel with complimentary coffee and snacks available and a shuttle to the terminal.",4,2016,10,14
245,Can't beat this really ,"Everything you'd expect from a quality hotel with the extra Irish touch of welcome.  
As close as you can get to the Airport with regular included mini bus transfer (with a friendly and helpful driver!). 
We've stayed here quite a few times now and so we don't even look at the other hotels. 

The staff are excellent. The bar and bar food is excellent.  Fabulous sea food chowder. 
The rooms are great. 

We've arrived with loads of large and heavy luggage and they kindly help with it all and store it safe and sound. 
There's a mini take out breakfast if you're up early enough. 

The price does vary a lot.  We've paid from £60 - £140 for a night. I don't know if it's pot luck or if you book earlier you get a better rate.  
We've another stay here next month and it's £50 cheaper for the same room type  but with breakfast!! 
Excellent hotel. ",5,2016,10,12
245,Absolute Nightmare: Filthy Room & Incompetent Staff. Never Again.,"We stayed here overnight on our return from Paris to Vanvouver, believing we'd close our trip to Europe in comfort and ease. The location of this hotel is certainly excellent and the shuttle to the property is efficient, the drivers friendly & helpful. The lobby fixtures are modern and inviting. That was the extent of the pleasant parts of this experience.

For whatever reason, we were assigned an accessability room with low fixtures and dated decor in poor repair - my husband and I are 6'2"" and 5'10"" respectively and had booked a normal room months in advance to ensure no issues. The condition of the room: parts of furniture were broken and it looked like someone had opened a pop bottle that had sprayed the window coverings and ceiling - it had never been cleaned. We queried the room assignment with the front desk and requested a room change because this was not the room we booked. We were told the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing they could do. We were disappointed but don't like to make a fuss so started to unpack. There were no available power outlets to charge our devices - the only one was far from the night stand so we called for an extension cord. A woman arrived at our room with a VIRTUAL SCIENCE EXPERIMENT! She couldn't even be bothered to wipe off the CLOTTED DUST BUNNIES AND OTHER ASSORTED FILTH from it - she had clearly pulled it from some obscure area. I politely told the lady she could keep it. Hubby and I decided to go to sleep and shrug off the experience. I pulled back the coverlet and discovered 2 CLEAR, PROMINENT HOLES IN THE SHEETS!!! I called front desk again and she said the best she could do was send someone to change the sheets. I finally had to lay out the fact that the condition of the room was unacceptable & I would wait to speak to a manager for immediate rectification. All of a sudden we were assigned another room that aligned with the pictures on the site at the time of booking. We were never offered any discount or apology of any kind. Nobody followed-up with us to ensure we were comfortable in the new room either. I regret not photo-documenting the filthy disrepair of the first room for all to see but was eager to get out of it. We paid for a pricey, bland and poorly served breakfast the following day. 

It has taken me ages to post this review as I didn't want to rehash that apalling experience but feel it's important to share it. There's no way this property is anywhere near the four star it claims. Following this experience, it's unlikely I'll ever stay at a Radisson - if this experience is an index of the brand then we can do without.",1,2016,10,12
245,Walking Distance from the Airport,This hotel was amazing.  It was walking distance from the airport.  The hotel was clean and nice.  We took the cab to trinity college and it only took about 20 minutes.  The cab drivers in Dublin are amazing.  They are lime tour guides and are very honest and friendly.   No one tried to take the circuitous routes like the cabbies we had in San Francisco😡.  This hotel had a bar/ dining area that is pretty nice and reasonably priced.,5,2016,10,11
245,Excellent,"Modern, clean , friendly staff . Courtesy bus to airport and friendly driver . Nice bar and nice touches . Would stay again when in need . Room 333 on a Wednesday  night and no noise . Well done to the staff and management . ",5,2016,10,10
245,Pleasant wait for a plane ,We booked a reasonable overnight at the airport and headed into Dublin City centre then overnight before our flight lunchtime. The rooms are generous and bar facilities good. Complimentary transfer to the airport is good and both the paid transfer bus into the city and a taxi back from the city centre is reasonable priced.,5,2016,10,09
245,Great hotel with friendly staff,"I checked into the hotel later on in the evening and was greeted with warm smiles from the whole team.  I was checked-in by a ""trainee"" and I have to say they were extremely professional despite the potential lack of experience - even made great conversation.  When I checked into my room I found it extremely spacious, clean, and with a very comfortable bed.  However, the reason it gets 4 out of 5 marks is because the hotel is showing its age.  The bathroom especially had a few parts that were clearly needing new grouting and some parts that the paint was chipping off the door.  Otherwise, the stay was fantastic.  Finally, it was extremely easy in the morning to zip off to the airport in the free shuttle bus.  The driver, Patrick, was fantastic and made great conversation with me.  I very much enjoyed my stay here - be it for one night.  If in Dublin again I'll be sure to book here.",4,2016,10,09
245,Dublin airport option,"Radisson Blu @ DUB is a great option for the night before return to the US. Hotel is easy to get to, clean, has great staff, and has good food service as well. Gas station and rental car return are also easy to access from the location.",4,2016,10,08
245,Great location and excellent food,"Can't beat the location on the Dublin Airport. The food is excellent, had a pizza late one night which was excellent. Breakfast is also wonderful, especially good assortment of baked goods & full Irish & European breakfast choices",3,2016,10,08
245,A restful stay,We stayed overnight before heading for a morning flight to Killarney. The room was spacious and quiet with a very comfortable bed. The restaurant in the bar area served adequate meals.There is a  free shuttle to the airport but we found it was quicker to walk along the footpaths provided.,4,2016,10,06
245,2 night stay in an airport hotel,"We left St.Johns at 23.30 for a 4hor flight to Dublin,this meant we would arrive at the hotel cf 4.30 in the morning. There was a hotel courtesy bus awaiting for us at the airport( the bus operates 24 hours every 15 minutes)
The Hotel was very helpful taking our luggage ,providing  refreshments and an area for us to rest until our room was ready, we were impressed with the service so early in the morning",4,2016,10,04
245,Dissapointing Radisson Blu,"Is the closest hotel to the terminals - 5 minute walk from T2.
Check in was efficient & the lady checking us in was very cheery & helpful.
Hotel is showing its age. Room felt dated & worn.
Bathroom had seen better days - black sealant & grouting in shower. 
Level of window sound proofing was poor - woken at 4.30am when the trans Atlantic arrivals began.
The high point of our 1 night stay was the meal in the restaurant . Service was quick & with a smile. Food was served hot & was tasty & well presented. Pricing was surprisingly reasonable for an airport hotel.
Check out was fine & the courtesy mini bus had us at the terminal in no time.",3,2016,10,03
245,Pleasantly surprised ...,"I don't generally expect much from airport hotels but this is probably the best I have stayed in. Friendly staff , nice room , breakfast to go at 4am in the morning which was most appreciated. Location was excellent  more or less within walking distance of the terminals though we still availed of the free shuttle bus.",4,2016,10,03
245,It's so convenient to the airport,"The hotel is visible from the airport, and is barely a three minute walk away. The rooms are nice, the breakfast buffet is good, and the staff are also very nice. It's the perfect place to stay to catch a morning flight.",4,2016,10,01
245,Overnight stay,Stayed at the Radisson Blu for one night before returning to US.  The hotel is convenient and has a restaurant with good food.  Rooms were clean.  Carpets were very worn in hallways will piece of carpet coming up.  All in all I will stay here again.  Good place.,4,2016,09,30
245,"Need to try harder, showing signs of high volumes through the door","Upon Arrival the Parking was great, the Reception could have done with more desks open. Upon entering the Lift and corridor to room there was a stale odor (could do with Air circulation or open the windows). Room was bright and Spotless but the bathroom needed repair (shower). Beds were tired and not comfortable didn't sleep well. Went to Restaurant T3 and had lovely meal but service was slow. Had lovely breakfast. Overall was not as expected from this level of hotel.",3,2016,09,30
245,Good to be back ,"Returned back here after trying the competitor across the road...won't do that again..
Great evening, great food, best of service....the bar here has a real buzz about it..
Fantastic rooms and services, lastly but not least great staff, very helpful and friendly.
Only gripe, stayed park and fly, pick up after calling hotel is always a bit confusing...you will get there in the end ....

If the hotel representative is reading this...Is there any chance of a dedicated signed pick up point at both terminals?
Still can't wait to return for next park and fly....",5,2016,09,28
245,In the airport,"I have stayed at this hotel several times before when I have an early morning flight as it is literally minutes from the departure terminals. The hotel has continued its refurbishment to good effect and is now modern and comfortable, with little sign of ongoing work. The restaurant, has a limited menu but the food is good and the bar has some atmosphere. The buffet breakfast was also good offering  typical Irish breakfast as a good start to a day's travels",4,2016,09,26
245,Very fine combination of training and staying,"I organized a 4 day training in the hotel and was well treated. Especailly the meeting and events coordinator (Grace) made sure everythings was there. But also on the day to day basis, people were very helpfull. My room was clean, and certainly enough space; the furniture is a bit outdated. The kitchen served good food during lunch, nice foor for dinner. Breakfast is very good. 
I recommend the hotel for business purposes or when you need to be at short distance from the airport; you can walk but a shuttle from the hotel is always available.",4,2016,09,25
245,Two Night Stay At Radisson Blu,"Location was terrific for easy airport access. Rooms were quiet, but just OK....no wash clothes in bathroom, no fridge in room. Handicapped bathroom was lacking a hand held shower head....Desk staff extremely nice and helpful.",3,2016,09,25
245,Very conveniently located,"The Radisson at Dublin Airport is our go to hotel when we have an early morning flight. It is very conveniently located just minutes from the terminals. The room is clean and large, the bed is comfortable, we always get a good nights sleep. The restaurant has a reasonable menu but closes early. The staff are friendly and helpful.",5,2016,09,24
245,Good - missing things great hotels have,"I don't normally use Radisson, but the normal hotels were busy so booked in.  The rooms were nice and well equipped.  Food was good and the staff were helpful. 

The gym was good, but was a short bus ride.  Again the staff were great about drop off and pick up, but it does add 20 mins to your workout time.

The hotel is near the airport, but whe.n using taxis, there are no shops nearby ( it would be another bus ride). And there are no vending machines.  This meant no chocolate bars for nibbles.

All in all, it was good, but if it had the extras, if could be great.",3,2016,09,22
245,A joke!!!,We chose to book an overnight stay at the Radisson dublin airport as we had completed a 4 1/2 hour flight and had an early onward flight the NY when we arrived at 1a.m we were asked to wait to check for 2 mins.... 10 min later and no explanation we were still waiting! When we enquired why the delay we were told a technical fault. After 45 mins a free drink to placate us and a very evasive guy at the desk a taxi driver arrives and we are finally given a pathetic apology and told there was no room and we were being taken to another hotel a 45 min drive away. I had phoned to hotel the day previous to enquired about airport shuttle and was given no indication of a problem.  There was another couple as we arrived who we realised had the same issue.  The taxi driver informed us that this happens very often but customers are never sent so far away.  The Radisson did foot the bill but we had a very late finish and a very early start and only 3 hours sleep to get to the airport in early morning traffic for a 7 hour onward flight.  So much for a stress free stay 'on airport' !!!,1,2016,09,22
245,Disappointed ,"We stayed here for one night before flying out and I was really disappointed with the standard of the rooms compared to other radissons.
The location is perfect and that's ultimately what you're paying for but the rooms are outdated and look a bit grubby and tired definitely in need of a refresh - the throw on the bed was horrible and stained
The bar etc are all ok and the staff were friendly enough but I won't be staying here again if I'm travelling from Dublin
",3,2016,09,19
245,Not the Best Radisson Blu,"We have stayed in several Radisson hotels in our travels and this one does not meet ""muster."" The hotel is old and worn out. the room was small and everything in it is old and worn. 

The food was good and plenty of it and the service was great. The staff was personable and helpful.

Not much more to say about this hotel.",3,2016,09,18
245,Reliable ,I always stay here before flying.its a very nice hotel.close to airport obviously.  We've  stayed here at least 8 times. Lovely rooms lovely staff really good bar food. What it does it does very well . complimentary shuttle to and from airport are regular and convenient.. Will continue to go back.highly recommended... the extra cost is worth the minor difference from other hotels in the area.,4,2016,09,18
245,Very good airport hotel,"The Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport has the efficiency and basic functionality you need, want, and expect at an airport hotel. The check-in was far more orderly and quick than anything I have experienced in years of visiting Dublin. And I checked out when I checked in! Brilliant!
My only complaint was the pillow. Thin as a sock and only slightly wider. Ask your cousins at St Helen's where they get pillows and buy from that supplier. Heck, St. Helen's hand-me-downs would be a step in the right direction. 
Oh and think about the poor jet lagged souls who need dinner after 10pm. We hustled to the room and back down before the kitchen closed but we were at the end of our Dublin stay. If we'd just flown in, that 10pm cutoff would have been murder. ",4,2016,09,13
245,Lap of luxury,"We stayed here for one night in September 2016 before returning home to Spain. We had booked a junior suite, however, on check-in we were told that we had been upgraded to the executive suite, which was impressive. Lovely big bedroom with a really comfortable bed, lovely bathroom with both shower and bath, huge sitting room and additional toilet. Having been to a wedding the night before we thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in this suite. 

Breakfast in the morning was superb with a great range of both hot and cold items. Service friendly and helpful.

Shuttlebus to the airport is an added bonus.",5,2016,09,13
245,One Night Stay,Overall good experience. Front desk staff very friendly and happy. Dinner was slow service but food was good.  Breakfast was a disaster - no food and had to wait ages to top up food for buffet. Stayed before and it was excellent - just think they were not prepared for the rush at that time or were under staffed.,4,2016,09,13
245,Nice and friendly place,"This is a nice hotel, almost right on the airport, there is a courtesy bus to pick you up. The decor and standard is really good and staff are very friendly, all round we were very happy with this hotel",4,2016,09,12
245,Good location but only room service after 10:01pm on a Sunday night,Arrived in bar at 10:01pm to be told no food available in bar after 10pm. I was offered room service but I didn't want to eat in my room. I had a pint of Guinness and decided to walk to the 24 hour McDonalds just down the way. Instead ended up eating tin the Maldron. On the way back the bar staff were emptying the bar customers into the lobby for 11pm. Not sure why it all finishes up so early. Otherwise the hotel is very well located and feels bright and airy and a short walk to terminals 1 or 2 so will probably stay again.,3,2016,09,12
245,Perfect for the airport,"A big comfy bed, spacious bedroom, plenty of storage, a spotlessly clean powerful shower, decent toiletries, huge desk, good lighting, shuttle to the terminal and a reasonable restaurant (though service can be woefully inattentive).",4,2016,09,11
245,No sheet on the bed,A strictly functional hotel that is not particularly good value for money. This hotel is also the first to give me a room with no sheet on the bed!!!   Many other international airports offer hotel accommodation that is just as close to the terminals but that offers greater modernity and far better value. IO personally would not choose to stay here again.,3,2016,09,11
245,Close enough to walk to the Dublin airport terminal,"This is a generally good hotel. There are a few characteristics we would have liked to see improved: Our toilet was in a cramped corner behind the bathroom door and would not always flush on the first few attempts; there should have been better disability hand rails in the bath and toilet area; light switches were often confusing; electrical outlets mostly needed the standard 220v three-pronged adaptor to plug US rechargers and devices into (most modern devices will work on 110/220 volt sources without an external converter. Some hotels have the newer, direct USB port outlets. The bathroom did have one direct two pronged 110v outlet.) There is free Wi-Fi, but it did not always work well. The TV had a good selection of channels. For dinner you can dine in the Hotel restaurant or venture out to Kealy's Pub, which is just a short walk away. You can see its sign and back gate across the parking lots from the SE corner of the Radisson. A slightly further walk to the west will get you and your luggage to the Dublin airport terminal, making this hotel very conveniently located. We did have the breakfast buffet in the Hotel restaurant, which menu was similar to most of the hotels we stayed at in the British Isles. This was the only hotel we stayed in where room key cards were required to ride the elevators, adding a slightly higher measure of security. The staff were all friendly and helpful.",4,2016,09,10
245,Identikit business hotel that promised more,"A poor experience overall. I paid top dollar for an ""executive room"" - not by choice, they were the only rooms left. The room itself was a standard room with a nespresso machine and a towelling robe on the bed. Nothing else to differentiate.

Breakfast was ok. Highlight of the brief visit was the shuttle bus driver - lovely old guy with excellent customer service skills...",2,2016,09,10
245,"Clean, quiet, very accessible to Dublin airport","Morning flight so decided to stay night before and took the stay 1 night and 8 nights parking option - very convenient. Good sized hotel, friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were large (bathroom a bit on the small size), clean, quiet and comfortable. Good self help breakfast in the morning - they could do with improving the quality of their coffee! 
Courtesy mini bus runs to the airport every 15 mins, however we were so close to the airport we decided to get some air and walk - max of 10 mins.
Would stay again",4,2016,09,10
245,Good quiality hotel near the airport,"I had a 28 hour layover in Dublin, and needed a hotel close to the airport. I booked the Radisson using my points I had earned being a travel agent. Check in was a 2pm and our flight landed at 10am. They have a convenient shuttle that runs every 15mins right outside the terminal. We got to the hotel around 10:50am and planned to just leave our luggage with them in the luggage storage and go explore the town. But to our surprise the guy at the counter told us he would have a room for us in about 15 mins!! So we changed clothes and came back and our room was ready! The room was very nice, clean and we had a queen bed on the 5th floor. For being next to the airport it was fairly quiet and I had no problem sleeping. A little outdated but nothing to complain about. We didn't get to experience the restaurant or food at all with our stay being so short but the staff was also very friendly and checking in/out was a breeze! We had no problems at all and the location was perfect! I always book my clients at Radisson properties but had never stayed at one before. I was very impressed and satisfied with my stay and will continue to book myself and clients and Radissons when I have the option!",4,2016,09,09
245,tired travelers,"lack of attention to detail.  lamps crooked on room walls.  scuffed up table tops in restaurant.
the staff however was very friendly and helpful.
not a thing to do here and the business center has but one cpu.",3,2016,09,09
245,"Pleasant enough airport hotel, let down by disinterested staff","3.5 stars would be my rating if I could.  Not as good as the Maldron, but perfectly adequate for an overnight stay near the airport.

The building is fairly modern, and near the terminals (although not as near as the Maldron).  There is a regular courtesy bus and it's easily walkable if you don't have much luggage.  The rooms are adequately equipped.

Breakfast was good, although as experienced throughout our stay, starting at check in, the service was rather disinterested and a little cool.  We were left waiting in Reception at check-in whilst staff played with their computer terminals (there were no other guests around) and again for some time at the breakfast 'wait here to be seated' board whilst staff walked nearby; just a sense that the customer wasn't their first priority.  Our group of 5 was then led to a table for 4, necessitating my bringing over an extra chair.  Little things, but they did detract from the overall experience.

A better service experience would have taken this up to a 4-star review.  As it stands, we had a better experience at the Maldron on our return to the airport.  We would stay at the Radisson again though to give them a chance to work on this; perhaps the staff were having an off weeekend.",3,2016,09,06
245,"Not what you expect from a junior suite and then pay for parking, come on!!!","Having booked the Junior Suite for my recent stay as to be honest it was a lot cheaper than other Hotels close by and I was attending a function.  I found staff on reception to be good, but night staff rather poor (see below).  The door of my suite was badly marked, the orange chair in the room was sinking badly and had seen better days, which meant my wife found it very difficult to her make up in this chair in front of the mirror.  The bathroom had a small amount of mould around the bath area.  The toilet rocked a lot!!  The night porter could not offer us any snack food when we arrived back with friends to drink in the reception area at approx 2am.  When I asked for 2 x club oranges or 2 x fanta in a pint glass with loads of ice, I got a pint of orange juice with a load of ice!!  On checkout I was advised I would be charged 7.50 euros for the car park, which I was not advised on check in or any correspondence from the Hotel or the websites.",3,2016,09,06
245,Overnighter before flight,"Upgraded to a business class room on arrival for free . 

All I can say is that previous reviewers must have found some incredible quality hotels in the past if they think this is poor!

Big bed , clean linen , coffee pod machine , bottles of water in fridge , fluffy towels , powerful shower and a heated mirror. Comfy bed , early morning wake up call. 

All clean , all working , friendly welcoming staff.

Grabbed the complimentary breakfast snack bar and coffee before jumping on the excellent shuttle bus ( VW T5) 

It's an airport hotel , it's good.",4,2016,09,04
245,Utilitarian hotel at the Dublin airport,"Stayed here to facilitate an early morning flight out of the Dublin airport. From the lobby to the room, and everything in between, it is no frills. Key for me: room was quiet. had a decent restaurant on site. free shuttle to the terminals. free wifi. Negatives: hard pillows; room smelled of mildew upon entering; mold and mildew in bathroom; smoke detector covered with a plastic bag; lots of amateur repairs. If I am passing through Dublin again, I will consider staying here again, but I will also explore alternatives.",3,2016,09,03
245,Old hotel and poor food quality,"Nicely placed close to airport but old hotel and amenities. Had a burger in bar/restaurant which was fried until rock hard and the bread toasted like a cracker... not a very nice experience choose something else.. I should have known this when you mix traditional food with Thai and Indian food it seldom works.. Better focus on one type of kitchen and make it good.
Nice staff though:)",3,2016,09,02
245,Airport...you got a smilin' face,"180 Euro Business Class suite booked through work. 

Check in queues longer than MGM Grand!! Even at half ten at night

Bar staff brilliant

Veg pizza better than Napoli, Amalfi and Vicenza.

Decent airport hotel

",4,2016,09,01
245,Patsy & Angela,"Wanted to be close to the airport for our early flight. Was quoted 100 euros less over phone and website, had also booked 2 double beds but then was given one Murphy bed. When we went to reception they said no other rooms available. Because it was a rock hard Murphy bed with an inch thick of dust on the headboard, we called to ask for additional pillows. The receptionist said they were out of pillows. They were also out of hangers and the pant press was not working. We went for breakfast the following morning which consisted of cold buffet style eggs, sausages and oatmeal. They know they have a captive audience with the location so close to the airport. We met two other groups that stayed there for the same reason. Location to the airport. An awful hotel with terrible accommodations and service.",1,2016,08,31
245,Usual fare nothing special ,Stayed here one night. Nothing spectacular.  Clean and serviceable. Non Irish staff in reception were not great. Slow and not so pleasant. Food in the bar was pretty good. The bar itself quite soulless. Not sure if I would stay here again. Car parking convenient to the Terminal One. Five minute walk - no waiting on shuttle. ,3,2016,08,30
245,Radisson Blu Perfect for Overnight in Dublin,"This hotel was perfect for me: night arrival with an 11-hour layover (by choice).  I found the courtesy phone in the airport, made the call, was picked up in five minutes and was in my room soon thereafter.  I was upgraded to a suite and it was beautiful, including more amenities than I could have used in the time I was going to be there.  The bedroom was huge, the luxury bath was spotless, new, and the warmed towels were luscious. The office and television room was quite generous.  I could go on, but you get the idea!  Stay here.  I would have chosen this hotel over others while visiting Dublin had I known that everything was so convenient and priced well. The staff were very friendly.  I had no meals there.",5,2016,08,29
245,stop over,"Very nice stay even though it was a short stay as we had a checkout at 5am for a 7am flight. We left our babies music light behind which i got my brother to ring about while I was away in Malaga.  The hotel staff member that answered the phone to him was quite rude so was disapointed with that, they said they had no one stay with my name???",4,2016,08,28
245,Typical US hotel,This hotel was convenient to the airport and had conveniences of most US hotels.  Breakfast was good dinner not so great but they had a convenient scale to weigh your luggage on to make sure it wasn't overweight in the lobby which was nice,3,2016,08,26
245,"Great location, ok room","Great location - 10 minute walk from terminal 2.  We weren't allowed on the shuttle back to the airport that we wanted (it only seats 7?), so we could've waited 15 minutes for the next one or walk, and luckily it wasn't raining.  Room was ok, with plenty of storage.  Shower was excruciatingly hot - I could not figure out how to get it to be merely boiling, so that was weird.  Hallways had a weird moldy/musty smell, but luckily the room did not smell.  Blackout curtains were not good and the room lit up like the sun at 6am.  Breakfast was good but service terrible.",3,2016,08,26
245,Better than Bewley's / Claytons,"Better setup for the night before a big trip as it is more proximate to the airport and parking is easier to manage.  Rooms are a bit tired, but Lobby and bar nice.

Great welcome bag for my child.  Bathrooms ok but not awesome.

Overall more expensive than other options but a better set up esp if flying out early from Dublin!

",4,2016,08,25
245,Happy Landings!,"Despite being so close to the airport, this is a very quiet hotel and the only thing which tells you you are close to an airport is the view from the hotel room window which contains a sea of endless car parks. So, this is not a hotel you would choose for its bucolic setting, but rather one for its convenience to the traveller. There is a faithful hotel bus shuttle which runs between terminal one (bus stop 8) and the hotel every 15 minutes and this is useful to connect to your flight or the bus network which will take you to Dublin town centre which is about a 30 minute ride away. I would particularly like to thank Paul, one of the chauffeurs at Radisson, as he was extremely efficient in coordinating my rides to the bus station and back during my stay.

The Radisson is what you would expect from a 4 star hotel and it can be reasonably forgiven its rather bleak setting on account of its location. It is a clean and spacious hotel although with an overly neutral and unimaginative taste in decor and style which does little to inspire. The standard rooms are spacious, however, and they are well maintained and have what you would expect including an un-stocked mini bar which allows you the freedom to furnish and service your fridge as you wish. So far, however, there is not much to recommend this place, but the Radisson has several redeeming qualities which make this a great place to stay.

The first thing to mention about this hotel is the excellent service and the friendly and extremely efficient staff team who seem to all share and practice the same principle of 'your wish is my command'. I was never left wanting or asking for anything, because as soon as I said it, it was done. A complete lift malfunction late at night was resolved in minutes, documents which needed printing were done between the time it took to send the email and the walk from the room to reception. 

I cannot comment on room service or the restaurant, as I did not use these services during my stay, but the second thing worthy of note about the Radisson is the quality of the breakfast they serve. Even in establishments of similar calibre, I have often found the breakfast buffets disappointing for many reasons, and in particular, the quality of the cooked English breakfast. Too often the bacon is rubbery, the sausages noticeably processed and bland, the scrambled egg watery, the mushrooms and tomato flaccid and unappetising etc. Not so with the Radisson, and here lies their strength. I guarantee the English breakfast to be as good, if not better than  the one you would cook at home yourself. It is the best hot hotel breakfast I have had, and although not tried, includes black pudding. The breakfast includes salad, cold meats, cooked salmon (popular with the Japanese guests), fresh warmly baked bread and cold fresh pressed orange juice.

Overall I felt very well taken care of at the Radisson, and I warmly commend this particular hotel to you.",4,2016,08,25
245,Great airport hotel,"Stayed here as was heading out early from Dublin airport. 

Free upgrade on arrival to a very nice and comfortable room. Got some shirts pressed on the house. 

Had a lovely dinner in the bar / restaurant downstairs (great steak). 

Overall, very friendly staff. Rooms are what you want from an airport hotel (quiet, comfortable and good wifi).",4,2016,08,25
245,Last night in Dublin ,It is a nice hotel.  5 minutes from airport and you see planes landing with low noise.  20 minutes from downtown but you can't walk anywhere near hotel.  Good place to avoid traffic delays.  Check in was smooth and so was checkout.  Shuttle to airport was full so took a taxi for 7 euros. ,4,2016,08,23
245,Great stay before the flight,"Having stayed at the other airport hotels before early flights, the Radison has to be the best of the lot for the Dublin. From friendly staff to a decent meal and a great breakfast, to dealing with my busy children running around, I will definitely stay at the Radison again if we have an early flight out Dublin.",5,2016,08,23
245,"Good Hotel, Great Breakfast","Stayed here for one night. 
Big rooms with tea/coffee making facilities. Free wifi. 
Hotel hasn't been modernised recently but this isn't an issue as it's well maintained. 
There is a shuttle bus to the airport but I walked from T2 as it was so close, took about 3 minutes. You wouldn't know you're at the airport when in the hotel as you can't hear any aeroplanes. 
Had evening meal at hotel restaurant (called T3) which was good as reasonably priced. Breakfast spread was excellent. 
A very good airport hotel.",4,2016,08,23
245,Excellent overnight hotel for early morning flight - Faultless!,"Having an early morning flight out of Dublin I chose this hotel as a good overnight stay with easy access to the airport - and this could not have been any more a better choice.

The hotel has a regular FREE 24 hour shuttle bus service to/from the airport and even arriving late on a Sunday evening had plenty of staff on their Front Desk. I had equally forgotten my toothbrush and the friendly Front Desk called Housekeeping who brought me a toothbrush set within 5-10 minutes of asking for it.

In the morning, when checking out at around 5:30am, I was surprised and delighted to find the hotel provided free access to tea/coffee/fruit and snacks as a basic early morning ""breakfast"" type meal. This is a really nice touch when you take effectively the ""Red-eye"" planes as it provided a good early morning wake-up snack.

Excellent room, comfy beds, modern facilities and toiletries. I would 100% stay here again or recommend it to anyone needing to stay at Dublin Airport - especially in comparison to nearby similar standard hotels where this definitely outshines such competitors.",5,2016,08,22
245,"Design rooms, super breakfast, good restaurant",We staid two times at the Radisson at the beginning and end of our tour of Ireland and had a great experience. We had a newly renovated room that was beautiful and super calm. The breakfast is great! We will come back.,5,2016,08,21
245,Terrible airport option,"To start, the staff were disinterested and rude.  The room was quite shabby, the toilet took two flushes to properly flush, the bathroom sink did not drain, and the ventilation system in the room did not work.  That being said, the ONLY redeeming quality of the hotel was the breakfast buffet. We would have told the hotel about the above issues, but no one at checkout inquired about our stay. I contacted the corporate office and am awaiting a reply. AVOID this hotel if you are stuck at the airport and take one of the many other options.",1,2016,08,21
245,Disappointment overall,"Having stayed in a number if radisson Blu graded hotels, I was looking forward to this brief stay prior to an overseas vacation.
Sadly to say, although the room was adequate, the breakfast experience badly let down the stay.
Poor selection of breakfast buffet items, only scrambled egg on offer, no porridge, very limited choice of fruits and yoghurts. Not a memorable experience to start the day.",1,2016,08,20
245,Pleasant Stay,"We ended up stranded at the Dublin Airport for one night. Fortunately we found this great hotel within walking distance of the terminal. The mattress was the best I'd slept on in a long time. I really slept well. Friendly, helpful front desk staff. ",4,2016,08,19
245,Excellent one night stay,"24hr shuttle to airport, but 5 minutes walks you to T2. We took the shuttle bus because it was raining.  Car parking is cheap. We were flying out at 0630 and breakfast didn't start until 0700 but water, fruit and cereal bars were left for departing guests.",5,2016,08,19
245,Beautiful Room and Great Service,"Had an early flight out so wanted to be close to the airport.  This was an excellent pick. The hotel itself and the rooms were awesome! The staff at the Service Desk were very helpful and informative, especially Julie. They had a restaurant on site so it was convenient to get dinner. They also offer shuttle to the airport.",5,2016,08,18
245,It started off well....,"When I arrived, I still needed to return my hire car.  The receptionist arranged to send my bags straight to my room so I could go and take the car back.  That was a welcome idea and great service.

Unfortunately things ran a little less smoothly from there - when I returned the key to my room didn't work, and it took 2 trips to reception and a wait for the maintenance man to get it sorted out - he had to reprogram the lock unit.  This could happen to anyone I guess, and they dealt with it as quickly as they could - but I could have done without an extra half hour before I could get into my room.

There was a loud noise like someone using a power drill in the room - I assume it came from an adjoining room's plumbing - it work me at 5.30 which I wasn't thrilled about.  Considering this is an on-airport hotel, the glazing doesn't seem to have been upgraded in any way - so you can hear plenty of aircraft noise.

On the upside, it could hardly be more convenient for the airport and I did the east walk to the terminal rather than take the free shuttle.",3,2016,08,15
245,Convenient Hotel,"Clean, comfortable and convenient. I wanted to be near the airport. I also parked my rental car in the hotel parking lot. Everything worked out well. I also had a good breakfast which was the equivalent of a brunch.",5,2016,08,14
245,good hotel for a night at the airport,"Nice hotel if you have to spend the night at dublin airport... 
Rooms are great, staff is good.
They do provide you with a breakfast on your room if you leave before the breakfast restaurant opens.. very nice",4,2016,08,11
245,Just ok,"Was catching a 7am flight so overnighted at hotel for convenience. Check in was  quick , stayed on the 5th floor in one of the business rooms - all a bit tired I'm afraid and in bad need of a refresh . Had a room service dinner which was just average and actually bordering on being cold when it arrived . Grab and go breakfast at 6 am in the lobby was poor ... Kellogg rice crispie bars are not really breakfast staples for most people ! Queued for the bus to the airport but because there were so many people gathered for it I decided to walk ...less than 5 minutes so that was great ( in time for breakfast in the airport lounge which was much better !)",3,2016,08,11
245,"Good hotel, nice rooms. The best of the hotels inside Dublin Airport.","The Radisson Blu is located inside the airport. they have a 24 hour free shuttle bus going to the terminals, the rooms are nice, the breakfast is nice. If you have no luggage you could even walk to the terminals, its a 5-10 minutes walk, if by any chance there is a problem or delays with the shuttle bus. 

The downside of this hotel is that the buffet breakfast opens too late at considering their clientele schedules at 7:00am. They have a Grab and Run service from 4am where you can get some basic food and head to the terminal, but the grab and run food is not great. Dublin Airport's busiest time is from 6 am - 8 am. If you have to catch a flight during these times you will not be able to get the full buffet breakfast.

I crave for Dublin Airport to have a hotel built inside a terminal so no shuttle bus is needed, but the Radisson Blu would do the job very nicely for you.",4,2016,08,10
245,Tired rooms with view of the open bins,Rooms were rather tired and the bathroom not so clean. We had a view of open hotel dustbins from our room why they couldn't cover them I don't know.  Good shuttle service from airport and the staff were fine,1,2016,08,10
245,Airport stay,"Great place to stay if you have arrived late or leave early from Dublin 
We ate dinner at the local restaurant in the hotel. The food was good but slightly overpriced. The service was excellent.
The rooms are actually very quiet for being at the airport.
The free shuttle service is very efficient and even dropped me at my rental car facility.",4,2016,08,06
245,Excellent customer servixe,"I stayed here after arriving on a late flight.  I received a warm welcome on the free shuttle bus (which is a brilliant touch!) for the short ride to the hotel.

I was greeted warmly at reception and was very happy with the speedy check in.

My business class room was spacious and clean.

Two small criticisms about the room 1) the bathroom could do with a refurb... It was very clean, so can't complain and 2) The bed had a strange dent in the middle... I still slept very well, so again, can't complain!

Considering the proximity to airport, I had a brilliant nights sleep, although there was a bit of noise in the morning - sounded like bins being emptied? It didn't bother me as I was already up, but may have been a bit different if I was planning to sleep in.

Speedy friendly check out and another ride on the free shuttle back to the airport to meet colleagues who'd flown in the following morning, ended my stay here.

I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend this hotel to fellow business travellers.",4,2016,08,05
245,Convenient location,"Stayed here with the stay and fly package which included my parking for a week. This is very convenient to the airport and the shuttle taxi they run is brilliant. The hotel is nice but some areas need improving. The person driving the shuttle was friendly and helpful but the reception staff are rude, abrupt and cold. This has been the case each time I stayed over the last 3 years. Breakfast is lovely and great selection. Rooms are ok but we were upgraded to business class and room wasn't great. Poor soundproofing. The shower temperature control was broken. The toiletries they provided 3 shampoo and no shower gel. Tiles in bathroom cracked and dirty. Little things like this need to be addressed to keep the hotel fresh as it is not a cheap hotel.",3,2016,08,05
245,excellent customer service,We had our flight delayed last night and stayed the night in the Radisson. The guys on the front desk really went above and beyond to help us out. Very accommodating and pleasant to deal with in a stressful situation ,5,2016,08,04
245,A Little Extra in Our Lunch,"We were dropping our son off at the airport and decided to have a family lunch at the Hotel. The hotel looks very new and well decorated. We ordered a carvery lunch. Unfortunately my wife found something in her food which upon closer inspection turned out to be a plastic bottle top.

Obviously this was not what we expected and I returned the plate to the chef. He apologised and asked if my wife would like something else, but due to what had happened she did not.

Upon paying for the food we again mentioned to the waitress that we had found plastic in one of our meals, she immediately went to fetch the duty manager, whom to be fair was very apologetic. She gave us the entire meal for the three of us free of charge. This was fair and again the duty manager could not apologise enough, however it has changed our opinion of Radisson as a brand and needless to say, we will not be eating at this Hotel again.",2,2016,08,02
245,Airport Stay,"Having stayed at this hotel, I don't think it lives up to the Radisson hotel expectations, the rooms could do with some maintenance and cleaning up, I think there are better hotels cheaper near Dublin airport, The location is excellent.",3,2016,08,02
245,"Great Staff, fantastic Customer Service, close to the airport with a free courtesy transfer: simply perfect!","Upon arrival at terminal one,  we were warmly  welcomed by free  transfer courtesy by the hotel which sometimes was  Pat or  Patrick and Arthur  were  great drivers, helpful  and friendly  between the route of the airport and Hotel.

At the reception of the Hotel, we were greeted by  Mr. Peter and Ms. Ruta who  made sure that me and my brother had a fantastic  time in the Hotel. They exceeded our expectations in order to meet  our needs. Ms.  Ruta and Peter were very helpful, attention to detail in everything to run smoothly our staying in the Hotel. The Customer Service  was out of this word: Simply the best !!!

ALSAA gym which I HIGHLY recommend to everyone who wants to relax  in a lovely Jacuzzi, swimming pool, sauna and steam room.

For the restaurant in the Hotel, Mr. Martina who warmly welcomed me in the restaurant and recommended  me one of their delicious dishes which I truly loved and enjoyed to bits.    For main course:  Lamb Shank with champ mash potato and for dessert: Apple crumble with smooth vanilla custard. 

I HIGHLY recommend to anyone to be close to the airport and enjoy the Radisson Blue Hotel facilities.",5,2016,08,01
245,Comfortable and Convenient,We had an early morning flight so we spent one night at the Radisson at the Dublin Airport.  They have a shuttle that was very convenient.  The check in and check out went smoothly.  Our room was comfortable and clean and we got a good night's sleep.,4,2016,07,31
245,Top Hotel,"it was a wonderful ,all was very clean and the personel was very friendly reliable,very obliging,i feel well anf fine it was comfortable all in all very good.and a wonderful Breakfast i do like the irish one must taste ,my Irish friend says just try it ,iam from germany ,next when iam there i will come again.Thank you",5,2016,07,28
245,"After being a guest there for over 15 years, we'll never go there again","The hotel on itself is more than ok, it is the reception desk staff who ruin the whole thing. Some of them are rude, in the past we had to check the invoice every time. When we booked for a room breakfast included, breakfast was charged extra on the invoice, we were once charged for a newspaper! Last April we booked a room, the price of the room changed 3 times (upwards of course), and then we found much cheaper prices for the same hotel, same room on Booking.com. It's a shame for the other hotel staff : the shuttle bus drivers are very kind, staff in the T3 bar and breakfast room are extremely nice, room staff as well, but the reception desk is the killer.",3,2016,07,26
245,Worst nights sleep ever !!,"I stayed at the R Blu on business last week and whilst we had a decent meal in the restaurant, the issue was the bed. 

In many of their rooms they have fold down beds out of the wardrobe. 

Yes , in afraid to say it just wasn't a proper bed but one that had slats and a really uncomfortable mattress.  

This is not a cheap hotel and one if the basic demands of a hotel is a good bed / good nights sleep - sadly I didn't get either. 

In fairness to the hotel manager he took 50% off the bill but in hindsight , I shouldn't have paid anything for the room. 

So for a helpful tip ........

Check when you are booking to stay here that the room you are getting has a proper bed and don't settle for a fold down job. 

I would stay here again ,just not in one of those rooms !!

",3,2016,07,25
245,Ticks all the boxes,"Located on the airport complex about ten minute walk to terminals, with onsite car parking, and deals for park and fly. Staff very helpful. Room comfortable and clean, but didn't have any ironing facilities. Had dinner in restaurant - good menu choice, and food was fine. In the morning there was free tea/coffee and fruit/cereal bars available at 6am for those catching the free hotel shuttle bus to the terminal. All in all ticked all the boxes for a good airport hotel experience. ",4,2016,07,25
245,"Dated Hotel, but nice staff","I stayed here for one night before an early morning flight. Staff at check-in were very friendly and helpful.

The room was spacious, but exceptionally basic.  The formica furniture was straight from the 1980's.  No homely touches of any kind.  I had a meal at the downstairs bar - Food was fine, but I did not enjoy the atmosphere in the bar, which was somewhat chaotic and seedy.

On the plus side, if you're traveling light, you can easily walk to the terminals from this hotel.  In fact, I went for a late night walk to the terminal just to stretch my legs.  If you have bags, there is a regular shuttle bus.

This hotel badly needs a refit.  There are better hotel options (and in the same price category) near Dublin Airport.",2,2016,07,24
245,Dublin - Radisson Blu - good place to stay,"Suited our needs, close to airport and public or rental cars, breakfast included, were upgraded to Business class, stayed for three nights, one on arrival, two before we flew home, hired a car in between times, close walk to pick up car or they deliver. The public bus into Dublin for the day was Euros 3.30 each, (a #16 bus), drops off / picks up in O'Connell street, as for the rental car, overnight in the car park before return, validate your ticket for parking in the hotel. The place to stay for me / us.",5,2016,07,21
245,Average airport hotel ,"Great location for it is within walking distance to Terminal 2 where the US flights are and a great place to catch the bus into Dublin. Rooms are very average. I thought the hotel was relatively new, but it is not. There are no safes in the rooms and they look a bit worn.   They have AC which was needed due to a warm day and the sun shines directly into the rooms. Staff were friendly & had adapters that you could borrow if necessary. Convenient location but nothing special. ",3,2016,07,20
245,A good nights sleep before a flight. Expect nothing more.,"The Good. The bed is comfortable, the room is clean, the bathroom is adequate.
The Bad. Plug sockets are miles from the bed so don't expect to be using your phones/laptops and charging them at the same time. There arent enough towels provided in the bathroom particularly if one person of a couple has long hair and needs 2 towels meaning there are none left for anyone else. The hair dryer is S**T so bring your own one as well.

Basically only stay here if you have an early flight to catch as the only thing good is the bed.",3,2016,07,19
245,Avoid if you can!,"The service and staff were nice. That is about it for good.
The room is pretty big but noisy, carpet is sticky, furniture is old, not well maintained etc.
The worst thing was our experience with the room service. All we wanted was dinner. We called at 22:30 since the hotel publishes 24/7 and surprise, kitchen closed at 22:00.
It doesn't say it in the menu, it doesn't say it in the directory and all the signs say 24/7.
It was very upsetting! 
In the end, after arguing with front desk and room service - they were willing to make something but it wasn't tasty. 
Try to avoid this hotel. 
I saw less pricy hotels at the airport but we went there because We know Radisson Blu and always pick it blindly. I guess it is not always that great, too bad.",2,2016,07,16
245,"Business coffee and snack in prompt, friendly and efficient service.","A last minute rendevous in the middle of an afternoon in early July.
The large lounge is well attended by good staff and quick delivery of coffees and a snack while we worked on a last minute edit of a project ready for presentation.
Facility is good and iseal for our hastily organised meeting. Well sone Radisson",4,2016,07,15
245,Overpriced,"We booked this hotel last minute, which is the main reason for the inflated price ($400 cdn/night).  Although i understand that a hotel can inflate their price with weekends and last minute bookings, this rate was completely unreasonable for the quality of the hotel.  Service was fine, and location was convenient (you can walk to airport) but the hotel is old and worn.  In Toronto, Canada this hotel would not cost more than $75-$100 cdn.  And even then, I wouldn't book it.  Note: Book your airport hotels well in advance of your fly dates to avoid paying the inflated rates.",3,2016,07,11
245,Best airport hotel that I've ever stayed in,"We were only there for one night, but we really enjoyed our stay here. This is a first-rate hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We only booked our stay a few days ahead of time and booked a junior suite. To our surprise when we arrived we were upgraded to an executive suite. This suite was massive, bigger than most apartments in Dublin! The staff offered to print our boarding passes for us and let me follow them to the car return and waited for me to finish so that they would give me a ride back to the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel if you need a little oasis as you prepare for the chaos at the airport. The price was well worth the value that we received.",5,2016,07,05
245,Just OK,"It is very convenient the evening before an early morning flight.  The restaurant has great service and good food for dinner and is well appointed.

The lobby and common areas are updated but the rooms are very dated.  We had some issues with our shower and the room was very old and certainly nothing special.

The rates were reasonable so from a functionality standpoint it was good.  Free shuttle to the terminal as well and good service at the desk and in the restaurant.  Just need a major facelift when it come to the rooms and hallways.",3,2016,07,05
245,A memorable experience for all the right reasons,"I was upgraded to a business class room which was very nice.  Being alone, I had supper at the bar and chatted to the staff who were all very pleasant, helpful and welcoming.  The reception staff were efficient and pleasant also.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone (which I already have) and would return there with the greatest of pleasure.  I must also add that the courtesy bus was efficient and easy to use.  Altogether an experience which I would repeat.",5,2016,07,03
245,Fabulous Hotel,This is a fantastic hotel to stay when your leaving for Europe next day as so many flights leave from Dublin Airport and their shuttle bus takes you right over.  You can leave your car in their parking lot.  The staff there goes out of their way to help you. Breakfast is great also! ,5,2016,07,02
245,Not up to standards with other Radisson hotels,"Stayed there a few weeks ago in transit on a business trip. The hotel has a free shuttle  to and from the airport, this is very convenient. However, the hotel is very very average for a Radisson and this is why I do not rate the hotel better. There was nothing really wrong with my room or the hotel but it looked a bit old and shabby in the corridors leading to the rooms (while the reception area and the lifts look brand new). The room comfort and look are also very basic and a bit tired / oldish. Not what you would expect from a Radisson hotel (or for the price they charge). So a bit disappointing overall but it does the job of an airport hotel, without any frills or exciting bits.",3,2016,07,02
245,Short but excellent stay,"We arrived late in the evening (10.30pm) and were checked in very swiftly.  Our room (537) was an executive room, spacious, with tea/coffee making facilities and a very comfortable bed.  Breakfast the next morning was buffet style, with a fabulous selection of wonderful goodies to choose from.",5,2016,07,02
245,Efficient comfort,"Would normally stay in the city but as we were in town for less than 24 hours chose to stay as close to airport as possible and this certainly fits the bill. Emailed ahead to request a slightly earlier check in so that we could head out as soon as possible. This
Request was both acknowledged by email promptly and was accommodated. Check in was efficient and staff booked a taxi for us so we were in the city quickly as hoped.
Our room was very spacious , quiet and we enjoyed a great nights sleep in a very comfy queen sized bed. Up for breakfast at 7.15 to a wonderful choice of help yourself breakfast items including continental and full Irish. Coffee was hot and decent , only negative point of our whole stay is that our breakfast plates were cold meaning a cooked breakfast was cold when eating ....one of my pet hates ! Overall however we had exactly what we wanted an efficient comfortable stay, staff were professional and polite and we would definitely stay again in a similar trip.",4,2016,07,02
245,Great hotel and handy for the airport,"This was my second stay for business at the Radisson and it loved up to the previous great stay.

The hotel does offer a shuttle to the airport terminals, but I preferred the very short walk instead

The rooms are modern and well appointed and the staff aware very helpful.

The breakfast buffet has everything you need and the food was warm and tasty.

245,A miserable birthday evening,"I regularly go to Dublin for meetings, and usually return the same day, but this time, as it was my birthday, I decided to treat myself to a luxury night in a good hotel. It was a huge disappointment.  The room was very plain, but appeared to have everything necessary. It was also overlooked by the car park, so I had to draw the curtains for privacy. I did some work, then decided to go to bed early, as I had been up since 2.30am. I looked for a bedside light - there was one, but a tall panel had been built around it - it wasn't accessible from the bed without getting out. The panel also obscured the light, so the only way to read was by hanging half out of bed. I undressed and got into bed. It felt very lumpy, and I then discovered that I had been given a futon, not a mattress. I was too tired to get up, get dressed again and complain, and eventually fell asleep. I also discovered, when I had to get up in the night, that there was a wooden shelf jutting out around the bed about 3 inches off the floor - just at the right height for catching my ankles. It was a miserable time, at a charge of 197 euros - much more than I would normally consider paying for B&B, but, as I said, I had expected a luxury birthday night.",1,2016,06,27
245,"Good airport hotel, fantastic breakfast","Stayed one night ahead of a transatlantic flight. Located minutes from the terminal with frequent free transfers makes it very convenient. Room was a good size and was clean and had a/c!! Even though the hotel was very close to the airport there was no aircraft or traffic noise from the bedroom. Had bar food in the evening. Decent menu choices and the quality was good with the prices a little on the high side. 
Breakfast was a self-service buffet and the choice was amazing. Good quality cereals with loads of fresh fruits available. The choice for continental breakfast was extensive with loads of meats, fish, cheeses and breads to choose from. The hot buffet had all the usual offerings.
Staff throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful. 

",4,2016,06,27
245,Close But way to expensive ,"Very, very outdated interior, be prepared, you won't get what you are paying for. 

Friendly staff though and close to he airport terminal, 5-10 min walk, or 24h shuttle available free of charge.

I would look for something else nearby next time if I could",2,2016,06,25
245,Good airport hotel,Stayed on two separate occasions and this is good hotel if you need to stay at the airport. The café and restaurant were very good and the rooms adequate for one night stay. Very little noise from aircraft taking off and landing,4,2016,06,24
245,One night,"Stayed on 22nd June. Room was good had all we needed. A bit overpriced though. Unfortunately the outside aircon which was noisy ran all night, so sleep was minimal. Toilet had problems flushing, although the hotel responded quickly to my complaint, still had trouble flushing. The staff were  friendly , helpful. Restaurant was terrific, food great , service good too.",3,2016,06,24
245,Good service ,"I can definitely recommend the Radisson Blue, the service was great, they very helpful and friendly,  had a lovely stay there. Food is good,  a little bit expensive but good food. Breakfast was amazing,  big variety and friendly staff.",4,2016,06,24
245,Good for overnight stop,"Serves the purpose if the intent is to spend a night in a comfy bed. Walking distance from the airport, with nothing much to explore around. There is access to a pool and health club within walking distance as well, but not part of the hotel. The hotel itself is showing its age. The carpets in the corridors were ripped out and heavily worn. The rooms are a good size and have all the usual amenities one would expect. ",3,2016,06,22
245,Friendly staff but hotel needs updating,"I arrived at the Radisson after coming from the Radisson in Letterkenny.  So the difference was noticeable.  Both had friendly and helpful staff.  But the airport Radisson needs a bit updating.  My room (137) needs a new mattress.  It had a large dip in the middle and was hard to get comfortable.

I had dinner in the bar area.  I ordered a chicken cesar salad which was very tasty.  The wifi works well.  The shuttle service to the airport is very convenient.  For the convenience and service, I would definitely stay here again.  I just hope I get a better mattress next time :)",3,2016,06,19
245,last night in dublin,"ending our Ireland vacation here was sad end to otherwise great trip. hotel was dirty, poorly outfitted, and horribly over-priced. stayed in better low end motels than this place. bedding/mattress were abysmal. food was bland and generally unpleasant. and everything felt cheap, dirty and falling apart. ",2,2016,06,19
245,Interrupted sleep,"I stayed here on 17/6/16 in preparation for a meeting at a nearby hotel. I had booked an accessible room. When I arrived at check-in I was given a big rigmarole of a questionnaire about my ability in the event of a fire which I thought was intrusive and unnecessary. I've never been given anything like this before. I could just have told them what they needed to know. The receptionist, who was very pleasant, was very apologetic about asking me to fill it out but it took a long time and I was tired after a long drive. When I went up to my room, hey presto, the usual crap that annoys me so much in most hotels. The accessible rooms are, all too frequently in the worst locations. It often feels like I'm being penalised for needing a little extra assistance. This time, not only an awful view over a rooftop but the central air conditioning system, which was noisy and ran constantly, was right below my room. I had an early start and I really wanted a good night's sleep. I'm lucky I wasn't getting up very early for a flight. 

Having said that the staff were very pleasant and helpful and the food was good. The room, noise aside was quite comfortable and very spacious so I had no problem getting around it. 

Please do more to soundproof rooms near the A/C duct. ",3,2016,06,18
245,Birthday party ,We had my sisters 21st on Saturday night what can I say this hotel went above and beyond to make her night so special the staff were the nicest and most efficient staff I have ever seen at a hotel they truly are a credit to your hotel. The food was amazing best food at a part I have had and all of the other part goers commented on how nice it was. I would recommend his hotel for any event they won't let you down you will have a memorable night in a fantastic location. ,5,2016,06,15
245,Radisson Blu,I have stayed here multiple time and have yet to receive any type of upgrade as a Gold Elite member.  No small gifts were offered either. The hotel is right next to the airport so that was a plus.  I will stay here again but just because I fly out of Dublin very early in the morning and need to stay near the airport.,3,2016,06,14
245,Home away from home ,"Having spent 3 days at the radisson blue hotel Dublin airport on business I have to say this hotel exceeds all levels of hospitality within the hotel 
This hotel is warm and welcoming to all guests they have a fantastic crew at reception. Who I found to be extremely efficient on all requests that I had during my time there 
The hotel rooms are warm and comfortable spacious and spotlessly clean with an excellent supply of refreshments for the needs all who are using the hotel.   
The food is excellent and there is a good choice of hot and cold dishes 
All staff within the hotel that I came in contact with could not do enough for me during my time at the hotel 
I would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone who needs access to the airport for business or leisure travel... 

Keep up you excellent service radisson your worthy of tlyyour high rating 
",5,2016,06,14
245,Outstanding,"We stopped here as we were attending a 21st birthday party here, we flew over from Birmingham and as soon as we got out of the airport caught the free minibus to the hotel..we were created upon arrival and gave details of where everything was...our room was big, spacious and clean..it had everything you needed..iron, ironing board, trouser press, coffee maker, toiletries, tea making facilities, bottled water, hair dryer etc...The bed was big and so comfortable, we didn't want to wake up. The breakfast was buffet style and had plenty to choose from, all delicious and hot..we attended a 21st birthday party on the evening of the 11/6/16 and it was well organised, buffet food hot/delicious and well run by the staff...we really enjoyed our visit and we will definitely stop here again, next time we visit family and Dublin.  ",5,2016,06,12
245,very friendly staff,"we ewere there for a couple hours rest before our flight back home. We were there from 9pm to 2am... as we needed to be at the airport for 2:45 am...  everyone at the counter, dinning room and shuttle were very riendly and helpful. they even came to our help with the checking-in for our flight....",5,2016,06,12
245,Poor check in policy,When I arrived I was informed that my room had been booked for the previous night. I produced the booking confirmation and they told me they had no rooms. Eventually a room was made available. Alittle bit suspicious of double booking of rooms,2,2016,06,09
245,Excellent location for early morning flight,"My wife and I stayed here on May 20th. It was our first stop on our two-week honeymoon to Indonesia. The room was ideal, comfortable spacious and a perfect start to our holiday. They offer a 24 shuttle service to and from the airport with a very friendly staff on hand to cater for your every need. 

We had dinner downstairs which was delicious and not too expensive.

Overall the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport delivers on what it is there to do.",5,2016,06,08
245,It's a room,"The hotel shows it age and can be a little dreary looking . Bad design flaw , toilets behind doors facing a wall ? Who came up with that idea. ? The bath is in need of some serious 
Caulk work and updating . No iron or ironing board in room but you have 20 year old pants press. No ice machines on any floor. No gym but they grant you access to an off site gym . Shuttle to hotel from airport . Downtown is 25-30 euro trip . Hotel staff is pleasant especially Maria . She was very helpful . A plus the hotel room A/C kicked butt . Nice and cold . ",3,2016,06,07
245,Underwhelming experince,Room shabby and tired. The bath did not have a plug. One bath towel and one hand towel only for two people. No hairdryrer. No bedside lights which made it very difficult to read. We were woken just before midnight by a loud alarm which stopped after a few seconds. This was the worst value £140 pounds I've ever had.,2,2016,06,05
245,Airport Terminal 2 very walkable,"I stayed at the Radisson Blu Hotel at the Dublin Airport for one night in early May returning from a Business trip.  I had a rolling bag and a laptop case and walked to the hotel in 5 minutes…all on sidewalks with cross walks where you need to cross.  The hotel is in sight (to the right) as soon as you leave Terminal 2.  I took a bus from here to go into town also but I think there is one right be the hotel.  The hotel did have a gated parking lot and free shuttle service to and from the airport.  Check in was kind of slow mostly because a group was in front of me…but it seemed like she had to push a whole lot of buttons to get me my room.  All the staff I encountered was friendly.
  
My standard room was fairly large on a middle floor (245) and it is everything you need for a night before a morning flight.   Everything in the room was clean and worked how it was supposed to...the shower had odd controls that were harder to figure out than it should be, but there was hot water and good pressure.  The entire bathroom needs updating.  The toilet rocks when you sit on it.  When I investigated I saw it was secured with a deck screw.  The hot towel rack was nice (be careful…one of the switches by the room door turns off the hot towel rack.)    The bed was big and comfortable with good pillows and good reading lights.  The robe and slippers are a nice touch.  The window did not open but the air conditioning was excellent, which is hard to find in Europe/UK.  My room overlooked the walk to Terminal 2 but I was not bothered by any airport noise.
  
The room had: 3 sitting chairs around a small glass table (you can take one of those chairs to the writing desk/ TV stand to work), a full size couch, a nice luggage shelf, enough outlets, a small flat screen TV, phone, tea and coffee (my room had both the electric kettle coffee/tea service and the automatic single brew style coffee machine), small refrigerator (No mini-bar), closet, iron and board, pants press, free Wi-Fi, the bathroom had the normal amenities (Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash, soap).  The hair dryer is in a drawer under the TV.  Noticeably missing was a safe.  The elevators require key cards to access a floor.

There is a Bar/restaurant downstairs.  There were some TVs and a few different sitting areas.  I had a beer and the rib dinner to eat. The food was ok and the atmosphere was good and the staff attentive.  I pre-paid for the breakfast ($12.00) which was average for what you would expect from an airport hotel.
   
There is nothing real close to this hotel besides the airport and no grounds to speak of.  They do not have much to do onsite.  They have a deal with a nearby gym for access for guest…they will shuttle you over...seemed like a hassle to go relax in a hot tub.
  
I would stay here again because in the end a clean bed and a hot shower close to the airport is what you are paying for.",3,2016,06,04
245,"Have stayed here many times...this time, significant drop in service/quality","I've stayed here about 5 times now. The last 4 visits were great. This time, I booked a so-called ""Standard room"" which was quite dated, worn and depressing looking. Also, apparently, no Nespresso machines in the 'standard' rooms, which was one of the reasons I loved staying here. 

The beds are still comfortable, but the pillows were worn, flat and pillow cases smelled like someone had slept on them. Stale. I called and requested a whole new set of pillows. The room was poorly laid out, and all white walls felt less cosy than the Biz class rooms, which were earthy, woody and cosy. 

I must say, tho I've stayed here before and loved it, I'm rethinking my decision next time I layover in Dublin. Also, shower pressure was very poor in this particular room.

I still think the staff are great and breakfast decent (tho' this time I did not avail of the free breakfast). Also, only one set of towels, worn and smelled slightly musty......",3,2016,06,04
245,"Very average, good location for airport","This Radisson is slightly outdated, rooms are very basic even if on Business class level. Stains in the carpet and furniture give it out that nothing is very new. However room was mostly clean (if you ignore the previous quests luggage tag peeking under the bed) and everything in the room worked. Bed was nice as well as the pillows. 

I would not recommend to people who are light sleepers as at least on the rooms on the airport side of the hotel, you could very clearly hear every plane taking off as they go almost over the hotel. The one glassed windows do not help the situation. 

Breakfast very basic, nothing really to mention there. 

For location, the hotel is very close to terminal 2, just about 5 minutes walk and the hotel also offers free shuttle buss that worked very well to access either terminal. I would not stay here for longer than the night before or after the flight.",3,2016,06,04
245,Business class disappointing.,"It must have been a Business Class room because it said so on the door and I paid more for it. But it looked like an ordinary room, the bathroom was unusually small with an over-bath shower, the promised coffee maker was missing and the room safe had been removed. It was handy for the airport and the bed was comfy. But Business Class???",3,2016,06,03
245,Not 1st on my list.,Stayed one night for convenience reasons. While l accept location is everything this hotel is overpriced for what it offers its residents. . Food bad and way overpriced for the quality of food presented. Room fridge empty and not even a bottle of water in the rooms which would be offered in most basic hotels.. staff friendly at check in and in bar/restaurant. . . It's not my first time using The Radisson but will think twice in the future.,3,2016,06,03
245,Relaxing stay,Stayed for two nights with breakfast. The courtesy shuttle between hotel and airport was great. In a few minutes you could catch a coach into the city or other parts of the country. One tip would be if you use the coach/bus ask where it will pick you up from when returning because there are tram line works going on. Everything was clean and comfortable there was a coffee machine in the room with chocolates and slippers on the bed. The staff where very pleasant and helpful especially the shuttle drivers and people on the desk. Some of the bar staff were a little in experienced so paying as you go would be best.,4,2016,06,01
245,Great place for an overnight stay,"This hotel is fantastic!!  You get a very clean, quiet room, friendly and very helpful staff, and a breakfast that is not only quite fresh but has a large variety of food.  It is located right at the airport, which makes it very convenient for an early morning flight.  They have a shuttle that runs to the airport every 15 minutes.",5,2016,06,01
245,Free car parking a bonus!,"Arrived Friday, late afternoon. Had a quick  check in. Ordered taxi to take us to Croke park for Bruce Springsteen concert, were advised to travel earlier as the city was very busy. Ordered taxi for 5:30, taxi did not arrive until 6:15, reception kept us informed and updated  on the taxi status a few times during our wait.  Rooms are spacious enough for a couple, with  gowns, slippers, chocolates and toiletries as standard. We had breakfast in bed, couldn't fault it in any way. One of our party was celebrating their birthday, the hotel sent a complementary 'birthday cake' platter  to their room.
There is an excellent stand in the foyer with little cards with places of interest to visit, very comprehensive and handy little cards.  Car parking free unlike Dublin city centre hotels.",5,2016,05,31
245,Not good value,"Booked into this hotel for a one day airport transfer, not good value for money. The room was not upto the same standard as other radissons ive stayed in. Shuttle to/from the airport was good, also, the breakfast was lovelly.",2,2016,05,31
245,"Disappointing in terms of accomodations and services, especially in light of its costs.","No lighting at the desk.  One socket to charge phones or computers.  The rooms were certainly clean and large, but hardly warm and comfortable.  The hotel is close to the airport, a five minute walk at most to Terminal 2.  A shuttle is readily available every 15 minutes 24/7 and you are at the airport within minutes.  Most of the staff were responsive and helpful, but a few were rather cold--unusual in Ireland.",3,2016,05,30
245,Not up to par,"So the room was certainly not luxurious or anything but for the most part, it was clean. The floor wasn't so much and I like to walk barefoot but thats when I felt sticky stuff and random things rolling around on the carpeted floor under my foot. Gross. But ok fine, at least the bed and tables and bathroom was clean.

The bathroom while clean had a shower that literally only operated by the spray, not the shower head. So the spray would have been fine if the handle allowed for the spray to aim down. Instead it aims at exactly the opposite side of the shower. The part right next to the sink and without a curtain. There's no way to actually ""shower"" with this system. I ended up wetting everything, applying shampoo and soap, rinsing everything off and doing all this carefully given the spray had so much water pressure it hurt if you sprayed it on a sensitive part of your body. My husband got water in his ear accidentally. 

Now the restaurant was horrible. I mean inedible. Ok it wasn't the full restaurant cause the restaurant doesn't open til 12:30 for lunch and I'm starving at 12. They made it seem like the food came from the same place anyway, just the cafe was serving only salads or sandwiches. Fine. I ordered a super foods salad with prawns (15.5 pounds) and a fruit salad (6.5 pounds). The super foods salad had absolutely NO flavor what so ever. It was freshly made with cold mushy quinoa and cold butternut squash, roasted red pepper, some day old lettuce. I even saw the ""chef"" making this salad. I mean maybe they forgot to add dressing? It was seriously that bad. Completely bland, taste resembling no flavor oatmeal with random texture-less veggies. I picked out the shrimp cause I felt wasteful and then I tossed the rest. The fruit salad ... There were overripe watermelons, half of which was not edible and overripe melons with underripe white pineapple pieces. Oh and some grapes that were mashed up and mushy. I didn't even bother to try one, they looked over ripe too. 

The only redeeming factor was that the front desk folks were nice and the van driver was courteous and hard working. Otherwise I would have given it 1 star.",2,2016,05,30
245,Great service,"The excellence of the staff and the quality of the friendly service that they provided throughout my stay was truly remarkable and makes this a memorable stay. Attention to detail was paramount and the lady at checkout, whose name escapes me but from Ireland, was exceptional.",5,2016,05,28
245,Uncharacteristically disappointing,Past experiences with Radissons have always been positive so I was surprised with this location for an overnight before flying home from Dublin airport. No desk chair in the room and inaccurate information about hotel services. A waiter in the restaurant informed us that guests cannot charge food and rink to the room bill - information we were not given when we checked in.,2,2016,05,28
245,So convenient for the Airport,We had to make an early morning connection flight and the hotel has a very good 24 hour shuttle bus to and from the airport which takes about 5 minutes.  I wouldn't have liked to travel in from Dublin Centre at that time of the morning.  Otherwise the Hotel is relatively comfortable as you would expect from a Radisson and the staff were polite and helpful.,4,2016,05,27
245,Just an overnight in Dublin,"The hotel provided what we needed for a quick overnight stay. Clean, efficient, timely transport to the terminal. Very ""American"" and not what we typically encounter in a European hotel. Food was ""American"" as well. Would have preferred more local fare on the menu, except for breakfast...typical wonderful European. Staff were very friendly and helpful. ",4,2016,05,26
245,Ideal for a good nights sleep before a flight ,Hotel is ideally located right beside the airport terminals. Had good nights sleep here. Rooms are comfortable. Breakfast is very good with a good range available to order as well as the typical continental and irish breakfast options. Downfall is that there is no gym in the hotel but there is free access to a gym/pool a short drive away. ,4,2016,05,26
245,"Decent hotel,  great location","Very average for the high price,  but it's right next to the airport and that's the important thing.  The room was a bit dated, and the bathroom had a very noticeable mildew smell.

The staff was the hotel's best point.  Our original room was next to the elevator,  which was quite noisy,  and when I asked for a different room they were able to change it.  Very polite and professional.

The restaurant was awful,  but I'm not factoring that into this rating.  ",3,2016,05,26
245,I did sleep well.,"Checked in and slept between flights.  The staff wasn't particularly helpful. The room was not attractive at all. But the soundproofing was good.  It was like a clean cheap motel, just got 4x the price.  Overall, if you have time to go somewhere else, seriously consider doing so.",3,2016,05,25
245,Good Hotel at Dublin Airport,Had a good stay at the Radisson Blu before our flight.  Check was quick and easy; staff was very helpful.  Restaurant was fine for dinner.  Spacious and comfortable room; free wifi; frequent shuttle to airport terminals.  A good value.,5,2016,05,25
245,A very Positive Experience,"Exceptional comfort and convenience on Dublin Airport's Doorstep. Ease of check in with friendly, efficient staff. Excellent Breakfast to prepare in advance of flight. Certainly a place to relax with ease before travel.",5,2016,05,25
245,"Friendly service, but...","poor quality room (141) and furnishings.  No power socket within 6feet of the bed, unable to turn off the room lights without getting out of the bed, chairs too low for the table and desk (or table and desk too high for the chairs) - had to put both pillows on the chair to be able to use my laptop at the desk...

245,Bad reception and unconfortable bd,"When you arrive for the check in, you have to wait a slow process and very burocratic approach. I needed to have an invoice copy for the company and they could not print out (while I had no issue in another raddisson in Cork the day before). The room are poorly furnished with old mattress",1,2016,05,25
245,Very average airport hotel!,"Average hotel, below average rooms, average food in bar/restaurant, average breakfast.  Sadly this hotel was so underwhelming in every way I'm struggling to write any more.  Only plus point was that I could walk to the hotel from the terminal.",3,2016,05,25
245,Disappointed,the state of the room was awfull. bath chipped with brown sealant. And looked like moldon ceiiling.   desk had broken leg.  Furniture scratched.  overall extremely poor for a Radisson. Walls paper thin could hear child being sick nextdoor,1,2016,05,25
245,Good stay,"They make your business stay comfortable, having everything you need. Rooms are OK for working as well. The food in restaurant is good but service a bit slow, same for room service. Reception staff is very kind! Special thanks to Carmen, she helped us a lot.",4,2016,05,25
245,Staying at the Radison Blu,"Thought it was expensive but as it is very close to the airport,  Price reflects, I think, the captive market.  The service for dinner was poor with a long wait between courses and the main course arrived cold.  There was also a lot of noise not a pleasant environment..  Breakfast was served from 6.30 I arrived at 6.30 as I was flying out early.  Whilst there was a large selection which looked very appealing the cooked breakfast was again cold. ",3,2016,05,25
245,A little disappointed,"The room (234) was average/good. The bathroom was a bit poor, but it was clean. The room was really big, so that was very good.
Unfortunately I had to pay upfront...and when I had dinner or used the bar I had to pay directly...very unfriendly.",3,2016,05,25
245,excellent situation close by the airport,"room was perfect !! Every thing clean, very quiet and a lotbof space. 
Service for diner in the restaurant very, very slow !! 
We apprecied the ""mini-breakfast-buffet"" in the lobby  early in the morning (4:00 am) !! tks",5,2016,05,25
245,perfect airport hotel,"Perfect airport hotel for that one night stopover, or a little more.
Restaurant is very good as well.
PIck up and drop off to both airport terminals is very welcome.  
Rooms are modern, up to date.  Bathroom amenities  good. Good access to wi-fi",5,2016,05,25
245,Excellent customer service,"On check in the staff were friendly and helpful, the room was very nice, clean & a comfy bed. If I was being very picky the en-suite bathroom smelt very slightly damp. Room service was quick and again a very friendly service was provided - the Thai curry was excellent and the ice cream dessert was delicious. Breakfast was fine. Checking out was again was quick & easy despite being in the middle of morning rush. Will definitely stay there again on my next trip to Dublin as a very nice hotel that is only a 5 minutes free shuttle ride from the airport.",5,2016,05,25
245,Business trip,"I have used the hotel on numerous occasions over past two years and typically as airport hotel there are no issues . However on recent trips I have experienced issues with rooms. This time my shower had one setting ""hot as hell"" no matter what number you selected . Maybe that's a first world problem however given room rate per night that's far from ideal. Reception to be fair offered a courtesy breakfast upon checkout as way of apology however as catching flight wasn't possible. I will use hotel again but hopefully no more room maintenance issues . ",3,2016,05,25
245,Terrible and harmful experience.,"Arrived from a long trip to USA and was one of the worst hotels I've ever been unfortunate to experience, regardless of price. They took my booking and money online but upon arrival at 10.30pm was told hotel was fully booked. Staff were rude and discourteous from the moment they realised they were full, and due to lack of local expertise could not even help me find other accommodation. Pretty much the opposite of what is needed after an 11hr flight. They don't update their booking system online so be very aware a booking made here does not guarantee you a room even though they will happily take your money. Avoid like the plague; there are so many better options.",1,2016,05,24
245,Perfect for stays near DUB airport,"Best option if you need to stay near DUB airport (5 min walking distance).  Room and bathroom are confortable and clean. Reception staff is friendly and always willing to help.  However, hotel fares are getting greater with time and may need to be adjusted.",4,2016,05,23
245,three day stay,Pleasant efficient staff    good room quiet though toilet bowl ricketty   good food    plenty of buzz   easy car parking though some difficulty sorting out tickets   easily accessible   easy access to city centre   we were going 30 miles west to K-Club   easy journey,4,2016,05,23
245,GOOD BUT EXPENSIVE,"Have staff speaking French, To provide a plan with the possibility to go to the city center. Hotel already old and not luxurious as advertised. Good bedding - no French TV channel - No French translation of the hotel's services",4,2016,05,23
245,"Okay rooms, restaurant service terrible","We stayed in the Radisson Blu before our flight the next day. The rooms are okay, they fit the purpose and it was reasonably priced. We had dinner in the T3 restaurant. We easily waited, at least, 45 minutes after ordering. This seems a bit long considering it wasn't busy and 3 out of 4 of our party simply ordered the burger and chips while my girlfriend only had a starter.

The second problem was that the burger came with mayo, I am quite badly allergic to egg and so cannot eat mayo. I would have informed them of this previously, except that it didn't state this in the menu's description - which is actually against the law (at least in Belfast and I assume the rest of the UK where eggs are one of 8 allergens which must be declared along with mustard and nuts etc. ) 

When I explained this to the waiter, who wasn't the one who took our order, he seemed confused and didnt speak great English, he eventually seemed to understand and said he would take it back. Two minutes later he came back with what you would assume would be a new burger, the quickness made doubtful however and I decided to check again for mayo before eating. It was the exact same burger he had taken away no more than two minutes previously. Nothing had changed. He had literally taken my plate, done what I assume was nothing with it and handed me it back. If I hadn't have had the wit to check twice I could have had a very serious health problem on my hands and could have been verrrrrry costly for the hotel. I actually laughed in disbelief. As the mayo was touching lettuce and not the actual burger I simply took out the meat and ate it on its own with the chili jam, its a shame as it was fairly decent.

Nonetheless that is an unacceptable mistake. Maybe this is not a reflection on all Radisson Blu hotels, but given the general mediocrity of the rest of the hotel I wouldn't stay in another. 

On a plus note, the fruit baskets, bottled water and cereal bars at reception for guests checking out too early for breakfast was a welcome touch.

Otherwise it has to be the worst hotel I have stayed in.",1,2016,05,22
245,A good choice near the Dublin airport!,"A good choice as my meetings were close to the airport. There are free shuttles to and from the airport every 15 minutes.
There are isn't an onsite gym, but a free pass from the hotel allows access to a nearby gym. 
The rooms are comfortably large and clean. 
The buffet style breakfast is very comprehensive with everything from the ubiquitous baked beans to black pudding to smoked salmon.
There is a large double decker local bus called the 747 which you can you can catch down the street for €6 that goes into the city centre, and takes about 15/20 minutes.",3,2016,05,21
245,Steps from Dublin Airport,"A good choice as my meetings were close to the airport. There are free shuttles to and from the airport every 15 minutes.

245,Not a good room 318,"When you walked into the room the first thing that struck me was that the doors on the cupboard would not shut. The bath was badly chipped down to the metal in several places and the waterproof strip was missing from the back of the bath. Not what we expected for the Radisson plus the shower didn't work, just the hair wash head. This was our first stay in a Radisson hotel and we were not impressed with this room. Staff were fine and helpful and shuttle service was excellent.",3,2016,05,21
245,A Lovely Irish Welcome,"From stepping into the hotel and being greeted by Carmen at reception and served by Michael in the restaurant, this hotel is really all about the people who work in it. The service is welcoming and very efficient, the rooms are a good size with blackout curtains and comfortable beds always ensuring a good nights sleep. The breakfast selection and service is second to none with all you can image to eat in a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The hospitality did not end there, as Maria in reception wished me a lovely day when I checked out and then Paul kindly held the door open for me and offered to help with my luggage. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2016,05,20
245,Short but good stay.,"Very close to the Dublin airport, the courtesy van was very helpful. Excellent accomodations, very clean and organised. Staff very was always courteous and friendly. I will be back. It was easy to go from the Hotel to any other place in Dublin, even if you did not got a car.",5,2016,05,19
245,Overnight stay,The location of the Radisson Blu Hotel at the airport is very good. You are not allowed to access the floors unless you have a room key cark which I thought was a very good idea. The bar area was clean a spacious. The food was excellent and a great choose of wine and beer. the staff are very friendly and helpful.,4,2016,05,19
245,One issue after the next,"Well my most memorable experience in my trip to Dublin was getting stuck in the hotel elevator for over an hour. You are probably thinking 'this is a one-off, this won't happen to me' however, the manager said it had happened already 3 times in 4 months - so could be you! This was a pretty unnerving experience to say the least. This was then followed by many smaller issues, but it just kept adding up: 1) I had been given a late check-out at 5pm but this was not communicated and I became locked out of my room at noon (especially annoying as I was on the 3rd floor and was not about to get in their dodgy elevators again) 2) service in the restaurants is very slow, even for a coffee 3) I was told to take the hotel shuttle bus to the airport to avoid crossing busy roads but I ended up walking anyways as the driver had me waiting for a long time in the van and didn't say when he was coming back. On the plus, the rooms are completely adequate if not a little tired. Location is very close to the airport - walking distance if you don't mind running across a motorway with your bags.",2,2016,05,19
245,good hotel excellent location,"location is fantastic, doable when you go by foot from and to the terminal. However free shuttle buses that go up and down (approx 600 meters)
hotel is a little old but very clean, no noise of airplanes, friendly staff and good breakfast.
However for a hotel at an airport serving breakfast at 7 am is not my standard... and for this you lose a point. You should have a minimum breakfast ready at 5:30 and serve the full one at 7am
I will come back next time. 

parking also very good for my rental car and cost only 7,50 a day! ",4,2016,05,19
245,fairly standard,"rooms are ok, just a pitty the room service is limited and though the kitchen closes at 11 pm...even at 10.45 you can't order anymore...Then say your kitchen closes at 10.45. Plus after 11, only a very limited room service is available. For my colleague who is vegetarian no real meal was available anymore so he had to skip dinner. I had a room overlooking the garbage area....would it be difficult to obscure the view over an area with containers, empty boxes, trash, etc...? Not the nicest view I must say.",2,2016,05,18
245,Dirthy Hotel!,On entrance this hotel by famous brand of Radisson is definitely not a *4 experience at all.From the start to 1 person working at check-in at 5:30pm on a Friday nite with a Q.of over 7 people waiting in line i find this always is a bad start to any stay.,1,2016,05,18
245,Volume over quality,"Hotel suffers from the lack of maintenance and quality supervision
.focus is on volume vs quality . They have a captive audience hence the food lacks quality.the rooms are tired and need maintenance..compared to Radisson in Manchester, Dublin is sub-par",1,2016,05,18
245,Great place to overnight before early flight,"Quiet, comfortable, and convenient. The reception staff was thorough & helpful. They printed out bordering passes and advised us regarding taxis to town and shuttles to our flights. The bed and shower get great grades.",5,2016,05,18
245,Not a good experience,"The hotel claims to be very close to the airport... but fails to identify that you will need shuttle to go even into the gym. It also claims to be quite.. not at all and food in the restaurant lacked of taste and variety but was quite expensive in price . Although a 4 star it acted as it was a 2 star. There is a closer hotel with much better location , serivice and food. ",2,2016,05,18
245,Chic and comfortable,"I had a lovely time at this hotel, and the food in particular was outstanding. I had had an emergency when my other hotel plans for Dublin fell through, and the concierge was nice enough to check me in much earlier than a normal check-in time. Rooms are spacious and comfortable!",5,2016,05,18
245,Convenient and average,"This hotel is well situated to catch an early morning flight from Dublin airport. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful and responsive. However, the rooms and hallways have a worn look and the bathroom has an institutional character. Overall, a basic room. Not up the standards of other Radisson Blu hotels that we have enjoyed.",3,2016,05,18
245,Disappointing,"Charged me 50.00 more than price on orbitz even though told i was given "" best price""- very disapointing to discover overcharge! Cist
Was fir same date and same class room

No instructions given on how parking lot was operated- required multiple trips from lot to front desk",2,2016,05,18
245,Excellent,"Excellent service, friendly staff. Stayed when I was leaving for the airport very early the next morning and arrived late. Hotel very clean and large room. Good was good and bar had friendly international vibe to it",5,2016,05,18
245,Good for early flights,"You can't argue with the location, for early flights it's a great option.  It's always been my go-to place.  However, it's been getting pricier.  I used to be able to get a room booked well in advance for about 100 euro.  The last few times I've had to pay 160, 180.  What's happening with the pricing?  if this continues I'll move to a slightly further away hotel.  The  rooms just OK, not worth 180/night, especially when checking out at 6AM for early flight.",3,2016,05,18
245,Hotel Needs Some Love and Attention,"Rooms are in desperate need of renovation.  The desk in my room was falling apart and poorly repaired.  Upholstery was stained.  Bathroom was a bit scary.  The hotel is very convenient to the airport and the staff were friendly, but I wouldn't stay here again.",2,2016,05,18
245,"Good food, shame about the reception","We stopped for a bacon sandwich and coffee before we made a trip across Ireland. The food was good and very much enjoyed. The ambience of the coffee shop was also very pleasant. However when we went to get our car park ticket validated, the receptionist was not particularly welcoming or helpful and demanded to see our receipt before she would validate our ticket. It was as if she'd be paying for the parking herself. Sadly this left us a little bit disappointed overall. ",3,2016,05,18
245,Radisson Dubln Airport,"Room was OK - clean and tidy but not up to usual Radisson standards - time for a refresh maybe
Had to leave early for a flight (which is the reason why I was staying there) but coffee in reception area had run out
Very handy hotel for an early flight",3,2016,05,18
245,Meeting on 12th May 2016,"I went here for a business meeting in May 2016. The meeting room was very well equipped , temperature was perfect , tea / coffee and pastries we also very good. The staff were very helpful and overall made for a good meeting.",5,2016,05,18
245,Business trip,"Lovely hotel, great rooms, very spacious and everything you need. Very clean and bedroom staff very friendly.

I didn't give a 5 star as on check-in only one person on desk and waited 10-15 mins, this was around 10.30 in the morning. When did get to check in, staff very friendly and got earlier check in time. Breakfast in the morning was a bit strange, first time at hotel and wasn't sure if someone shown you to a seat? but no-one appeared, I found someone and asked who just advised to sit anywhere. Also had to ask someone for a pot of tea, again wasn't sure at first if this was a self service, which would be quite happy to do if advised.

Overall a good hotel and very convenient for the airport.",4,2016,05,18
245,Comfortable if a bit dated,"I love the Radisson Group and would always stay with them. Though I find that they could do with an upgrade to be more 21st Century. 

The Restaurant was also dated though the food amazing. I'd go there any time for a Seafood Chowder. ",4,2016,05,18
245,Business meeting,Excellent convenient hotel for business meeting and for overnights for airport..conference rooms perfect for all sizes of meetings...food very good...service excellent both during meals and in the bar ,4,2016,05,18
245,Only ok !,"I found my experience of staying in this hotel quite difficult to describe as it was a mixture of good and bad. The bedroom was very basic and the wind was howling in the room, through the windows. the heating only worked during the night and then it was too hot! the food was fine but the dining room - had a draft blowing through it. When I asked if I could move to somewhere warmer, I was told to look around myself. the food was only basic - very bland ! I was at a conference next day in the hotel and the facilities were very good. Wouldn't stay here again though.",3,2016,05,18
245,Tired Already ,"Worst guest wi fi I've experienced. Not a business hotel. Food adequate, rooms cheaply and poorly fitted out. Budget build- budget facilities-Not budget prices. Nice helpful staff. Tired decor and offering. ",3,2016,05,17
245,I don't want to share how good this is....,"When ever I fly in to or out of Dublin and arrive at a late hour, I prefer to stop here and unwind
This trip was on my way back home after a long day riding Harleys from Dublin to Kilkenny (Inistioge) with about 30 of my closest friends. 
The Radisson Blu, especially the business class rooms, provides guests with luxurious comfort, clean, quiet rooms, and a great bar and restaurant.
Admittedly most guests are tourists, either coming or going from Ireland, but there is simply no better or convenient place in my opinion, to start or end your trip.
The hotel is practically in walking distance of the airport, but provides a quick and convenient shuttle to and from the Terminal. 
Front desk staff are always helpful, kind and genuinely care about you the customer. 
The rooms are well appointed, and very comfortable and quiet. 
Ask for a room facing away from the airport for a lovely view and to see the gorgeous Irish sunrise.",5,2016,05,17
245,"Poor, but passable if no other option","I stayed here for three nights and my hotel room badly needed some renovation. The room was much less impressive than the lobby, which appears to have been updated more recently than the rooms. Bathroom was small, dirty, rusty, poorly maintained. Shower was in the bath. Bedroom felt worn, although was okay (if basic). 

The room service food was awful, surprisingly so in fact; ""meatballs"" were a burnt burger cut into pieces. Not sure how any hotel can produce such poor quality food in 2016.  It was swiftly refunded at check out. Breakfast though, was quite good. 

Invest in some refurbishment to bring the rooms up to scratch!  ",2,2016,05,16
245,Perfect airport hotel,Right by the red car park. Walking distance of the terminals but shuttle bus also provided. Big spacious quiet rooms. Friendly staff. Good food. Able to checkout in advance. The only fault was no drinking water in the bedrooms. Will definitely stay here again for airport convenience. ,4,2016,05,16
245,Services,"Before our flight to Orlando we stayed overnight in the Radisson At Dublin Airport.
We booked in only took a few minutes, room was really nice, tea, coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board, fridge, complmentory water. 

Bar food is also available lots of options from snacks to Full dinner. Good prices. Staff are so helpful and a full children's menu available. Child will eat free with an adult meal. What a service.

Reception staff very helpful, and a shuttle from Hotel to the Airport every ten to fifteen minutes.?

Breakfast is serviced in Main dining room again lots of different foods to choose.

If you need to stay overnight the Radisson is a must.",5,2016,05,15
245,Very efficient & comfortable,"I was in the area at a social event. The Radisson Blu in spite of being in the airport was one of the closest hotels to the event. Everything was handled extremely efficiently & with the highest of courtesy with a few personal touches.  I just needed a nice comfortable bed & I got that in the Radisson. Only for the main stairway area was quite dirty & that the lift is quite quirky, I would be giving this place top marks possible.",4,2016,05,15
245,Good hotel at Dublin airport,"Fairy good hotel just few hundred meters from the terminal. It offers good service, including typical Irish breakfast, however the rooms need a bit of refurbishment. The hotel also provides free shuttle from and to the terminal, however it is not easy to find the bus stop upon arrival to Dublin airport.",4,2016,05,15
245,Great beds and linen,"Great hotel. Beds are so comfortable .Bar food is brill and the staff are great. Having read other reviews now I must have missed the breakfast buffet, which was included. We only see a coffee and cereal option. Would return if we have an early flight again. ",5,2016,05,14
245,Good place to stay when at the airport,"This is very much an airport hotel with people constantly coming an going and always busy, car park full and restaurant staff rushed off their feet. Even so, the reception staff were friendly and helpful - I was dealt with on arrival by a young man who could not have been more helpful and went out of his way to ensure I had everything I needed. Room and facilities were good. Room was a bit too warm for my taste but the windows do open. The hotel is in the airport grounds and a regular shuttle bus will take you to your terminal / bus station or other destination within the complex. The driver of that bus was also extremely helpful, going above and beyond to get people to their correct destinations even when there was a language barrier.",4,2016,05,13
245,My stay A complete disaster .....totally disappointed,"I was booked into the Raddisson Blu Dublin airport for 1 night on the 11/05/16.
After returning to Dublin from a business trip and on a long hall flight , my company booked me into this hotel for 1 night to allow me to rest and carry on fresh the next morning to my next location.
I checked in late that night and went straight to my room 409 and to bed, only to be awakened at around 4:00am by the noise on machinery outside my room, this continued for about 15 to 20 minutes, I got up to check this and looked out my widow to find that the hotel refuse was being collected and bins below being emptied.
I returned to bed and struggled to get back to sleep, after some time I must have dropped of only to be a waked again at 8:00 am the same morning by a constant nocking/hammering in a room close by.
Totally exhausted I just got up and went for a shower to find the bath and shower area badly maintained white sealant clearly badly applied messy , gapping and black in various areas around the bath, I had a quick shower and lifted the bath towel to dry which was hard to the touch and very rough on the skin, well used I would say.
Total disgusted I went to reception to check to get back to the airport . 
I was asked at reception did I have a pleasent stay.
I made the above complaint, to which I was offered breakfast, I refused as I want to leave this hotel as soon as possible .
I paid £110 for a standard room I am really surprised that Raddisson Blu provide this poor level of service. I have stayed in much better budget hotels in this area.
I will be speak with our company travel provider about this experience .",1,2016,05,13
245,Short Stay,"Room was in quiet location close to the airport. Quality of bedlinen was good. I ate bar food and was delighted to be offered a table in a quiet area where I could not hear the  TV's soccer match.
Plenty of variety on the bar menu and staff were very pleasant.The breakfast is an excellant buffet.
Transfer to the airport in the morning was very well managed",4,2016,05,13
245,"Floor 3 has ""Business Class Rooms","Very good staff,efficient check in...very good security systems & less than a km from the airport (free shuttle bus )The ""Business Class "" rooms are very comfortable,well appointed & very clean..It has a large bar/restaurant area...nice pub food,courteous wait staff...oh..& great breakfast.I would just point out that room 347 has an intermittent gurgling noise from time to time...however,I'd stay there again..just not in 347",4,2016,05,12
245,Airport Stay Only,Radisson Blu is ok if you need to be next to the airport otherwise keep looking. Standard room had basically a double size futon for a bed. Property is dated and expensive for what you get. Carpets are worn and stained. We had an early flight and location was key for our brief stay. ,3,2016,05,12
245,Uncomfortable bed,I found myself sleeping on a folded out sofa bed which was lumpy and uncomfortable. Also given poor advice at the counter in the foyer regarding the availability and location of the swimming pool - sent us to the leisure centre instead - a considerable walk!,3,2016,05,12
245,Lovely hotel and restaurant,"Staff were friendly and food in restaurant was delious and great value for money, very child and family friendly! Check in was quick and easy, staff gave us a wake up call on time and free transport to the airport, not to mention the complimentary grab and go breakfast! ",5,2016,05,12
245,"Good location, but...","There were extremely slow service in restaurant. We had early flight on next morning and thought to take a fast dinner before going to bed. It took more than 60 minutes to get the food. After fast eating it took still 30 minutes to get the credit card reader. The explanation was that the restaurant was full of customers and they have only one card reader.
In the room there were not an electric outlet closed to the bed. I must use apnea machine while sleeping, but I was too tired to dress up and go to a reception for asking extension cord and I slept without the breathing apparatus; as a result of it I had a terrible headache on the morning.",1,2016,05,12
245,Dublin Stop Over,Great hotel with great facilities including free shuttle bus to T1 or T2 if needed. Flew in late on night before an important meeting to ensure no disruptions to travel plans so i would arrive in good time in a relaxed and ready to do business mood.,5,2016,05,11
245,Recent stay at Radisson Blu Hotel,"Our experience traveling in Ireland ended with a stay at the Radisson Blu Hotel.  Everything from check-in to check-out went very well, and we were perfectly happy during our stay.  You can't get any more convenient than being right at the airport, and with the shuttle service, and a wonderful restaurant on site, you really have everything that you need.",4,2016,05,11
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport Hotel,"The main issue I had with this hotel was the condition of the rooms. The rooms are very out dated and very old looking. The room I was provided was very poorly planned and the bathroom was so small and cumbersome as the door could not even be fully opened due to the manner in which the room has been put together. I was also expecting a king size bed or even two double beds put together to create a king size bed. 

The employees of the hotel were very nice to deal with however the I am not sue if I would want to stay at this hotel again as the elevator of the hotel is more up to date and clean looking compared to the rooms. 

The breakfast selection and layout is what I would expect and was well provided, good job to the hotel staff on this. ",2,2016,05,11
245,Short but good,Stayed at the hotel as we had a early flight the next day. Only thing I would suggest is an upgrade on the sofa bed. Really uncomfortable for the kids. Shuttle quick and very efficient! Check in and out was quick and easy. ,4,2016,05,11
245,Average,i checked into hotel yesterday and was given a room (132) which had a fold out bed and i immediately rang and complained and said i wanted a proper bed as i was charged €140.00 plus €11.00 for breakfast and i wanted value for money - i was then changed to another room 442 and that was much better - however i then woke up and went to have a shower and discovered the water in sink and shower was cold and had to endure a cold shower- on going for breakfast i said to one of the girls about the water and she said she would notify maintenance and i sad that was no good to me as i have already had my shower i was very disappointed first with room and then with water and i was not he only guest who was complaining i over heard other guest in elevator giving out and also my collague complained and was given a free breakfast i had food in your restaurant and found the food and service fantastic my experience im unsure if  i would recommend any of my work colleagues to stay with you when they are visiting ireland,3,2016,05,11
245,Blu,"Its okay, parking is typically expensive, food not bad, room a bit messy even with the business class room i had I expected a lot more.
Bed was comfy, however plugs no were near bed to plug in your phone.",3,2016,05,11
245,Rad blu,"Very clean, nice staff, great location beside the airport makes it easy to get into the city when you want to. Meeting space is bright with loads of Windows. Great breakfast! Food in the bar is great.",4,2016,05,11
245,Stopover visit,We used this hotel as we were travelling to Spain early next day staff very good and helpful cleanliness in room very good but bathroom needs regrouping black was coming through in shower / bath and for the price too expensive other than that good ,4,2016,05,11
245,Really enjoyed my stay,"Room was nice and clean. The shuttle service is excellent. Staff are very friendly. Had dinner in the restaurant and it was nice, had a few drinks after as well, very nice atmosphere.
Unfortunately woke up too late to have breakfast :(",5,2016,05,11
245,Excellent airport hotel,"Comfortable rooms, quiet, convenient, bar food, and full breakfast. Altogether a very good airport hotel.
Their shuttle bus to the terminals run every 10 minutes, making it very fast.
Windows in the rooms must be double paned, because we didn't hear the traffic or planes taking off. We will stay there again when leaving Dublin for home in the US.",5,2016,05,11
245,Disappointed,The Radisson Blu at Dublin airport is tired.  The heating system in our room was not working and the fan in the bathroom refused to stop running.  A call to the front desk to request maintenance resulted in zero response.  The public rooms look dirty and tired.  I have stayed here previously but won't return unless the hotel is refurbished.  ,2,2016,05,11
245,Excellent location at airport,Excellent location; cumbersome check-in process took longer than most hotels; good rooms and bathrooms. Had a room facing the terminal and was disappointed with how noisy the aircraft were - most airport hotels are very well sound proofed. Perhaps I should have requested a quiet room at the back of the building.,4,2016,05,11
245,The breakfast buffet was delicious,"Although we arrived late and left quite early the next day, our stay was fantastic and the breakfast buffet was well worth the visit. Overall it was a great stay and we would highly recommend anyone hiring a car at the airport to stay here because it's super close. ",4,2016,05,11
245,Convient but old,"Shuttle service took less than 5 minutes to reach the airport. The convenience couldn't be beat. However the hotel was a but dingy and clearly old. The overall value was decent. If you need close proximity to the airport, this is a good spot. ",4,2016,05,11
245,Fairly good.,Good stay. Better amenities would have made the stay even better. Probably it was too cold for us. People were courteous and understanding. You can arrange local site seeing at a charge. This will attract more clients. ,4,2016,05,11
245,Convenient,"Clean and convenient, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I did not have anything to eat other than an orange as I left on the airport shuttle early in the morning.  The staff was friendly and helpful.",3,2016,05,11
245,Exceptional Service,The staff bent over backwards to serve us! The quality of the food was wonderful! They upgraded our room at no additional charge because we somehow double booked! They were exceptional in every way! Recommend it highly.,5,2016,05,11
245,Terrible,"Outdated bathroom
No free breakfast en lobby is till 06.30. This wasn't mentioned on booking/ tripadvisor.
Looking over dumpsters and a truck woke us up with the beeping sound backing up. Hotel reperations were going on in the morning. Wifi is good and television channels fine (not a lot but there is a movie channel) we got a 20% discount on our roomrate for compensation.",1,2016,05,11
245,Business trip,"I have stayed at many Radisson Blu hotels in the UK and they have always been modern and tidy, this hotel is lovely  apart from the bedrooms and the Bathroom, my colleague also stated the same concerns.",3,2016,05,11
245,Great sleep,"Pro:Very comfy bed, quiet room, lovely staff and so convenient to our terminal. Con: carpeting is horribly stained in room corridors. Our floor lamp and some shades were nicely designed but quite shaky. Folding luggage racks would be a huge help. ",4,2016,05,11
245,Lovelly weekend  break.,Good location to explore Dublin City area . Friendly and helpfull front desk personnell. Large well presented room. Free airport shutle. Handy for next day early flight.Thank you!!  Enjoyed our stay!!!!!!!,4,2016,05,11
245,Pleasant stay with exceptional service,"I was really happy with my stay at the Radisson. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, the beds were very comfortable and ideal before an early morning flight.There was even a coffee machine in my room - delicious coffee is always a bonus. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a free dessert, a perk of booking a room on their site.",5,2016,05,11
245,Use a credit card,"Woke up to no hot water for a shower before my 7 hour flight. I paid cash for my room and the manager said it wasn't possible to give me a refund because I paid cash. After all the people who paid by credit card were given full refunds I was given $25 off of the $130 business class room they gave us while on our 20th wedding Anniversary. 
The only reason it gets 2 stars is for the breakfast buffet and the ladies at the check in counter. ",2,2016,05,11
245,Business lunch,"Lunch good, staff serving professional & friendly. 
My colleague paid for all 3 lunches but when I went getting my parking ticket stamped receptionist was rude, demanded receipt & sent me to a shed outside who where not in a position to assist me.",3,2016,05,11
245,Shocking,"Gym 10 minutes walk away with rusting machines.

Had to get the missing safe refitted. Shower fitting hanging off wall. Polls filler not sanded and finished. Ironing board collapsed on ky foot due legs corroded. Shall I go on...",1,2016,05,11
245,Budget friendly and easy to get to,"Booked flights to see Dublin for a weekend and then realized how much the hotels in the city centre cost. This was a great choice, as the hotel is very nice at a decent price (comparing to the centre)
I know that it seams far from city, but there is a free hotel bus running between airport and hotel every 15 min. And you can easly catch a bus to the centre from the airport. 
So whole journey is about 35 min. Was reserved to that idea, as was only there for a weekend and did not wanted to spend ages commuting, but the link between hotel and city centre was brilliant. 
And I saved almost 200£ booking there rather than centre od Dublin.
Hotel itself is a very good standard, good size rooms, fruity water dispenser in the reception area and tea and coffee and snacks/ fruits served there in the morning, which I found very handy when I was up really early to catch a morning flight back and didn't had time to stop in the hotel restaurant for breakfast. ",5,2016,05,10
245,Not a good Radisson Blu,"I drive up from Cork and stay here a fair bit when I need to fly out of Dublin Airport early mornings. Next time I'm going to forget about the Club Carlson points and try the Maldron next door.

Although the reception staff I find to be very good the restaurant staff need a lot of improvement. Be prepared to wait... and wait... and wait... They are so inattentive it's unbelievable. And trying to catch their attention is impossible unless you call them loudly. It's a usual problem here, like tonight I spent about 15 minutes with empty plates and a glass in front of me trying to get their attention so I could get the bill. And when I got a waiter's attention he told me I had to wait for my waiter. I think he sensed my irritation at that, and sent someone else because my waiter was nowhere to be seen. The 'replacement' waiter gave me the bill and walked off without giving me a pen to sign and I called after her but she kept walking. I had to wait for another waiter to come to serve the people next to me also I could get a pen. 

If you sit at the bar there's a couple of bar staff who are great and attentive. But a couple of times before there has been bar staff chatting behind the bar and completely ignored me. I don't think I smell that bad :(

The restaurant itself always has flies. Tonight wasn't as bad as two weeks ago though when it was really bad. 

The food isn't great and is pretty pricy for what it is. Do not get the lamb stew. I got that a few weeks ago and the meat was tough and grey. More likely mutton than lamb. The Irish Board is tasty but you don't get much for €12. 

But on a positive note, I did get an upgrade to a suite a few weeks ago because of a previous stay to that I complained about noise in my room. It was an irritating buzzing noise in the wall behind the mirror. All the lights and the fan in the bathroom were off, and the bathroom door was closed but I could hear it from the wall. 

Other reviewers have noted that the rooms are dated which is true but they're not bad enough to to complain about. I've seen much worse that costs more. 

Overall I'm very disappointed. I keep coming back here thinking it's just been a couple of bad times (it can happen in almost any hotel) but history repeats itself. They should get tips from the Radisson Blu is Schiphol-Rijk which is one of the best hotels I regularly stay in and is miles better than this. ",2,2016,05,09
245,Best thing was the shuttle driver!,"We arrived on a plane at 4 am and realized we needed a bed before seeing friends in Dublin.  I must give extra points to the Radisson for taking us in on a ""day"" basis, charging about a third less than a night would have been.  We got a room with a smallish bed.  Shower hard to manage in jet lag.  It was ""OK"" until we met Paul, the shuttle driver.  He helped us in several ways, including getting us over to Hertz to rent our car for driving to County Cavan for a wedding.  We loved Paul!",3,2016,05,09
245,Excellent location.,"Very close to Dublin Airport, excellent location with transfer every 15 min 24 hrs which makes it a good choice for early flights Very smooth service. I will definitely stay there next time when flying early from Dublin Airport.",5,2016,05,09
245,A dismal experience!!!,"The first problem was the toilet did not flush.  Maintenance fixed it, but it broke again after one flush.  The exhaust in the bathroom did not work - a real problem since we both had a stomach virus with diarrhea.  Next, it took 3 visits from maintenance to finally get some heat, which we could not regulate.  And the topper was no hot water in the morning.  I complained to the front desk who made me wait for the hotel manager who would not compensate us until he talked with his supervisor.  He never showed up and we had to leave.  A terrible experience never to be repeated.",1,2016,05,07
245,A Great Place to Stay Near the Airport,My wife and I stayed at the Raddison Blu Hotel on our arrival in Dublin and before leaving on our return flight home.  The rooms are spacious and surprisingly quiet.  The staff are very helpful.  This is perhaps the best airport hotel we've experienced.,5,2016,05,04
245,I enjoyed my stay,I stayed here before a flight and it was very nice indeed. It's even possible to walk to the airport if you're travelling without luggage. The room was very nice and the breakfast buffet was excellent. This is the only airport hotel in Dublin where it's close enough to walk if you had to.,4,2016,05,03
245,Excellent hotel - Well done guys!,"Excellent hotel a couple of minutes on foot from Terminal 2. There is also a free shuttle, just give them a ring from their phone in the arrivals hall and they will pick you up. Rooms are big and with all comforts: tea/coffee facilities, Nespresso coffee machine, a free bottle of mineral water, free wi-fi, etc. You can also use for free the fitness centre located 5 mins from the hotel. The breakfast super-buffet is absolutely delicious. You can even order a separate dish (omelette, salmon scrambled eggs, etc.). I will definitely go back next time I am in Dublin. Well done, Radisson!

FAMILY LEAP CARD - EUR 10: Very good deal to travel from the hotel to Dublin city centre by bus: up to 2 adults and 4 children travelling together, unlimited travel on Dublin bus (Airlink as well), Luas, Dart, etc. in the Dublin area for 24 hours, valid until 31 December 2016. Order online and have it sent to you for free beforehand, not available to purchase at Dublin airport.",5,2016,05,02
245,Good Airport Hotel,"Stayed here for one night before a trip away.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.  Room was comfortable and quiet.  We enjoyed our meal in the bar that evening and breakfast the next morning was great - so much to choose from! Our only issue was that we found when we checked in that reception staff was not very forthcoming with information - ie. about when and where breakfast was served and carparking fees and in the middle of me asking these questions he took a phonecall.  Saying that this wouldn't stop me staying here again.",4,2016,05,01
245,Above Average for an Airport Hotel,We stayed here one night to make a flight connection and to visit friends in Dublin for dinner.  The shuttle bus picks up at the terminal and was quick and easy to find.  The taxi into downtown Dublin cost about Euro30 and took about 35 minutes in early evening on a Monday.  This hotel is modern with a predictable chain hotel layout but the room was spacious and clean.  Staff was friendly.  There was no in-room safe for valuables which we found surprising.  We had a breakfast included in our package and it was well done with a lot of choices.,4,2016,04,29
245,Meh Hotel Airport,"Stayed at the Radisson Blue at the Dublin Airport so I wouldn't have to travel far in the morning to catch a flight.  The front desk staff was friendly, although I had a Visa with no chip and the woman could not figure out how to manually put my card in, since she couldn't get it to swipe either.  My sister got so irritated she just paid for my room.  The rooms are OK, they really could use some new pillows, they are about 2"" thick, had to stack two up.  The bathroom to me was designed in a way that makes no sense.  After a fairly high step up into the tub/shower, there's a weird half glass wall that allows the water to splash out onto the tile floor making it dangerous.  The towel rack/heater is behind this glass wall so there's no way to reach it from in the shower.  We had great appetizers and drinks in the hotel bar and had a great waitress.",3,2016,04,29
245,good,"organised an event at the hotel.
had great support and help from the staff.
when we needed help with coordinating the minors at the event, staff were at hand to help sort this out.
An over all great experience",4,2016,04,29
245,"Very disappointed, dreadful food and cheap horrible bed linen.","This hotel simply is not up to the standard one would expect from a Radission Hotel.  The two positives are the staff (reception was excellent)  and the location.  The food we had for dinner was dreadful and couldn't be eaten, (they desperately need a competent chef) and the bed linen cheap and rough.  I think it would take a week to get the bath to fill.  Would not stay there again.",2,2016,04,29
245,For a quick overnight before a flight it is adequate,"I was impressed buy how convenient to the airport, I could see the terminal 2 entrance from my room. The lobby and elevators are nice the room is something of another question. I wouldn't want to stay for an extended period of time but as the title says it is adequate   ",3,2016,04,29
245,Very Nice Airport Hotel,"We had an early morning flight out of Dublin, so we spent the night at the Radisson Blu Airport.  It's located right on the airport, and has a 24 he shuttle bus, so it's very convenient.   The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable.  It was also very quiet for an airport hotel. We enjoyed our short stay there.  I'd definitely recommend it!!!",4,2016,04,28
245,Good location next to DUB,I stayed at the Radisson Blue Dublin Airport last week and found it to be convenient and well suited for the business traveler. The front desk staff was on top of their game and the restaurant was surprising quite good.  I would highly recommend this hotel,4,2016,04,28
245,Business Trip,Good Hotel for Businesss Trips near by the Airport including free Transfer to the Terminal. Breakfast Buffet are also excellent. Wide area rooms with nice and clean ambient. Reception desk are friendly and helpfull,5,2016,04,28
245,"Quiet, Comfortable airport hotel",Lovely reception and dining area. I booked a junior suite. Clean and comfortable but the bathroom is in need of a little attention. Overall ideal for commuters but not quite up to the standard of city Radisson hotels,4,2016,04,28
245,Disappointed,"The worst hotel room I've ever stayed in. Dirty bathroom, dirty tray with kettle that didn't work.  Cup/saucers old + worn. Pull out bed uncomfortable.  Damaged furniture -decor could do with overhaul.   Room was likely used as a conference room.  Delineate between conference room versus accomodation!  Requirements are not the same!!",1,2016,04,28
245,"Great hotel, restaurant not so great","Staff was wonderful, room comfortable and convenient to the airport.  The restaurant was not so good.  I ordered the nachos and was terribly disappointed.  I was brought a bowl of nacho cheese flavored doritos with some cheese melted on them, a small amount at that, and some ground meat in a tomato sauce.  No lettuce, tomato, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  They were awful.   Service was slow, but staff was friendly.",4,2016,04,27
245,Jim and Sue,"The reception was excellent and helpful in respect of returning our hire car to the appropriate area at the airport although it took a couple of goes for us to get it right.  Depending on how many people ask how to get to the hire car return place, it may be worth having a simple map at reception showing the easiest route.

The dining area was good - it seemed very crowded when we were there and service was a little slow but the food and beverages were great.

Our room was ok but  not sure that we appreciate the pull-down from the wall bed.  Also, perhaps the bed needs a new mattress as my wife and I tended to sink in towards the middle or perhaps that is a result of the way the mattress sits in the bed frame.

We sometimes stay at Rydges at Sydney airport and I would say that the bar/dining and the rooms at that hotel would provide a good guide to what we had expected at the Radisson.",3,2016,04,27
245,Not Blu,"This hotel is in bad need of a makeover. The lobby and downstairs look very good, but the rooms are dated. The main shower head has barely enough pressure, so you have to use the hand shower to get a decent shower. The towels are of poor quality, more like Motel 6 types, thin and hard. You have to pay for parking, but that is really academic because there is no parking, you have to wait for someone to leave to get a space. If you want to print boarding passes they have this little tiny Android tablet with a printer. Otherwise you have to pay (coin operated no less) for the full sized desk top machines with a reasonable screen. I have stayed at a lot of Raddison Blu hotels and this one is not even close to the level of the others. For the money, it is not a vallue unless you absolutely need to be at the airport for the night.

",2,2016,04,27
245,Business trip to Dublin,"All you expect from an airport hotel. Close to airport, quick and efficient check-in and check-out. Frequent shuttle service and the bus driver who brought me back from the hire car drop off went out of his way to get me as close to the hotel as possible. Had a meal in the bar which was good and the service was fast. Large screen TV to watch the Rugby highlights with plenty of draught Guinness - what more could you ask for. Room was clean and tidy and bed comfortable.",4,2016,04,27
245,R,"Hotel very good , very friendly ,welcoming and efficient  front desk staff. The shuttle bus service to and from airport was excellent.  Room service was very good  and waiter  was very friendly and efficient.   Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,04,27
245,Very comfy hotel,"Arrived late, had difficulty finding pickup coach at airport. Once found, rang and bus came for us in minutes.Received a lovely welcome at reception, upgraded us to a business class room.
Lovely spacious room. Breakfast was amazing!",4,2016,04,27
245,Never again,"There were black hairs all over the sheets on the bed, clearly hadn't been washed. I will never again use this hotel for either business or pleasure. The room was very dated, it was more like a motel than a hotel. I have given this same feed back to my company.",1,2016,04,27
245,Friendly hotel,"We stayed on our second occasion at the Airport Raddison,and enjoyed our experience,very helpful,friendly staff and the coach drivers were always courteous and kind.We had breakfast both mornings,excellent,and you could ask for your eggs done in any style.We will be back ",4,2016,04,27
245,Great location for a meeting at Dublin Airport,"I had a valuable opportunity to use the Radisson Blu Hotel for a short meeting beside Dublin Airport, and again found the facilities and value offered to be excellent. The parking is so easy to access as you enter the two airport terminals, and because I had a lunch there was not charge. The cafe is very relaxed but you know the professional and friendly staff are always aware of what's going on and provide great service in a non-pushy manner. So if you need a great place to have a catch-up, a meeting, or even to just chill out if you are on an extended stopover in Dublin Airport  (it's a 2-3 minute walk from the Terminal 2' arrivals), you will not find a better option.   ",5,2016,04,27
245,"Comfortable and quiet, furniture has seen better days!","The furniture in the room was a bit scuffed and worn, however it was comfortable and quiet. The restaurant had a heavy, greasy 'fish and chips' smell so I didn't use it. The hotel is close to the airport terminals and the early morning shuttle service was very good. ",3,2016,04,27
245,Old facilities,"Lovely staff, nice, helpful and very professional, but the facilities of the hotel are so old! Bathrooms are terribly old! The shower the toilet just so so old and used! I was shocked to see such standard of hotel",2,2016,04,27
245,Great,"Location was great for us.  Shuttle and shuttle drivers were great.  Pat and Patrick were great.  We had another driver, but can't remember his name and he was really nice also. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would be going to Dublin.",5,2016,04,27
245,Amazing stay,"Nice hotel. Convnivent location. I liked the idea of being near the airport during my short stays.

Airport drop and pickup for 24 hours is really thoughtful.

Highly recommended. Keep it up blu !!!!!!!",5,2016,04,27
245,Disappointing,Arrived at 12.40 with no idea where to find hotel shuttle as its sign posted poorly. Finally got to the hotel and we were given a room suitable for one person. After ringing reception they sorted a room for two. An experience that was less than enjoyable,3,2016,04,27
245,Excellent service,As a 50 yr old yet again i was much impressed with your younger staff level of customer service.I arrived missing my connection due to delayed flight and even at the late hour they were both wide awake welcoming cheery and obliging nothing was to much trouble ambassadors for your group thanku shay sheerin,5,2016,04,26
245,one night,we stayed at this hotel due to it's proximity to the airport.  It was close and they offered shuttle service to airport which was excellent.  The rooms need upgrading as well as the bedding.  Showers were moldy and very outdated.  Very weird setup with a half glass door and water was all over the floor when I got out of the shower.  Not enough towels(2),3,2016,04,26
245,Overpriced,"Very poor soundproofing. Tired and jaded and certainly not what you would expect from the Radisson brand. Well able to charge but not so good at upkeep....poor shower pressure,torn upholstery. Cold coffee at the early morning checkout . Overall very dissapointing, would not stay again",2,2016,04,25
245,A good stay,"We stay in Dublin a number of times a year enroute from Scotland to USA and like the helpful staff, room and the breakfast is really special. Smoked salmon and poached eggs !All in all good value for money.",5,2016,04,25
245,Terrible service from terrible staff.,"Booked this hotel as I had a conference the following morning. Difficult to find the shuttle bus at Dublin airport, due to very poor signage. Booked a triple room checked in at 2pm. Reception staff curt. Third bed not made up or any linen to do it myself. Reported to reception again.  There was no hot water in the room on arrival, reported to reception and decided to have lunch in the foyer cafe until the hot water came on. There were only three tables eating. It took 45 mins to get my hot sandwich order, which had been given to another table. Back in room, still no water and was moved to another room. No hot water there. Contacted reception - taken to yet another room - no hot water. In fact no hot water anywhere in the building so how staff were washing their hands is anyone's guess. Bed still not made.  Decided to have dinner in another nearby hotel due to poor service and no handwashing. Hot water was available at 10.30pm. Three of us went to sleep, woken an hour later by a guest coming into my room who had been given a key by reception. Back to sleep, phone rang in room, then went off. Rang again - reception apologising for person coming in to room. Had breakfast - and finally a shower in the morning - was quizzed by dining room on why there were three people in my room (triple). Breakfast actually quite nice other than the wait for tea and coffee. Checked out, no apology made by same reception staff. Possibly the worst service I have experienced in a hotel. Will not return.",1,2016,04,25
245,large clean room perfectly situated for airport,"checked in late and was given a lovely large room at the end of the corridor, more of a suite with a sofa etc....I was on the business floor, adequate breakfast in a nice setting, and walkedd to terminal 2....perfect!",5,2016,04,25
245,Business Stay,"Comfortable. 
In walking range of both Terminals.
Even if it is a big airport hotel there were no ques at the reception.
I had a business class room. There were a desk to work and standard equipment of such a rooms.
I little bit too expensive and you could have a similar standard in other hotels but than you need a shuttle.",5,2016,04,25
245,Comfortable beds and convenient to the airport,"[
Comfortable beds.  Good service.  Excellent breakfasts. Very convenient to the airport and the highways.  However, the lobby was too stark for my tastes.   It had a cold ambiance rather than a warm, welcoming ambiance.   It was very utilitarian and conveyed the message that this was just a stop over place on the way somewhere else.    ",4,2016,04,25
245,Ok,Was a nice place and very convenient to airport. Shuttle runs every 15-25 minutes! We did have an issue with the toilet. Called and desk sent someone up. Unfortunately they did not fix the problem.  It would have been nice to have a functioning bathroom. ,3,2016,04,24
245,As expected,Keeps standards of Radissons. Location excellent for travellers flying to/from Dublin airport. Breakfast much better than most of other Irish hotels. Menu at restaurant should meet expectations of business travellers and priced reasonably. Ask for rooms after refurbishment as those not refurbished yet are bit used.,4,2016,04,24
245,Work Stay,"Nice hotel in perfect location for airport business or travel. Friendly staff. Lovely breakfast, with good selection to choose from. Had a lovely room on 5th floor. Only downside was shower not very powerful.",4,2016,04,23
245,Will never book this again.,"You would think that a Radisson Blu hotel would guarantee a certain level of quality across the globe... in fact it's not the case here. While the service is probably of the same good standard of other Radisson Blu, the rooms here are terrible, it feels like a room from the 80's... Considering the price you pay it's a total rip off. If you need to stay close to the airport, go to any other hotel around.",2,2016,04,23
245,Fantastic helpful and courteous staff!,"Very nice stay, practical location, outstanding staff who are always there if you need, just a few names to mention: Sandor, Joanna, Arthur, Anna and Mark, the shuttle drivers and another very nice Spanish young lady at the reception.
Thank you all!",5,2016,04,23
245,"Excellent location right beside the airport, helpful friendly staff and very handy shuttle to terminal","Couldn't ask for a more convenient location right beside the airport, helpful friendly staff and very handy shuttle to terminal which is available whenever needed. Food served till late in the bar. Good parking rates as well. ",5,2016,04,22
245,"OK, few hiccups","We stayed here after arriving in on a late night flight with an early connection the next morning.

Although I had booked a specific room type (double with a sofa bed for a family of four) the room had been given away early and the room proposed would not sleep the four of us. This took some convincing to the late night desk staff and several visits to the room. 

Eventually though, they seemed to understand and provided us with a second room free of charge which was a reasonable offer and one that we had requested early on in the discussions. we got there in the end.

Unsurprisingly there was some confusion at breakfast the next morning too, with them seeking to charge for all four when it had been included in the rate--I had to show the reservation email.

Overall, this was an OK hotel with OK rooms and a decidedly average breakfast offering.

The confusion with the rooms was unfortunate and unnecessary and should really have been resolved much faster, but they got it sorted in the end. 

Wouldn't rush to recommend this hotel, especially if more than a solo traveller, but the staff did eventually provide the right degree of service recovery.",3,2016,04,22
245,Reliable comfort right where you need it,"Yes it's a corporate, on the airport hotel, so we are not talking boutique here or luxury but it gives a better experience than most Holiday Inns or Hiltons.  Clean, very good showers, reasonable sized rooms with comfy beds.  Restaurant actually does very nice food and a reasonable wine selection.  Not able to accommodate if you ask for anything different to the menu though.  ",4,2016,04,21
245,GOOD AIRPORT HOTEL,"We stayed at the Radisson because we had an early flight back to the States in the morning.  It was fine and clean and served its purpose.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the shuttle service was right on time the next morning.  Don't expect anything great in the restaurant -- the food was truly mediocre, to be polite.    ",3,2016,04,21
245,Hotel airport,"Clean, comfortable, courteous  and friendly staff. Had a great stay. Conveniently located by airport. It was a great place to rest and start fresh the next day. Check out was fast and easy. I recommend this hotel",5,2016,04,21
245,Good place to stay,Very happy and relax evening for diner and night. Breakfast is also perfect. Waiter have plenty of attention for their guests. Shuttle 24 / 24 to the airport so no difficulties nor trouble to manage. Interesting either for business and private trip ,5,2016,04,21
245,Radisson Blu Belfast,Dated décor in the public areas and very yet expensive but poor food. Cost of hotel didn't warrant quality. Visit was limited in terms of time in hotel but won't be recommending this to my company colleagues or our central booking system.,2,2016,04,21
245,great convenient business stop before flight,"good value, with LEAP card allowing travel all around Dublin, made it up to Howth. Hotel close to the airport walk/shuttle , excellent breakfast. only issue with Gym in another facility hard to find or take shuttle to get there. excellent friendliness from staff, would likely use it again when flying from Dublin airport.",5,2016,04,21
245,very close to the airport,"the position of the hotel is very close to the airport and make trip very efficient. Rooms are normal and well clean, check in/out very quick, breakfast is ok. That's ideal for trip that need to have frequent movements by planes.",3,2016,04,21
245,business,"The receptionist was unpleasant , my room very Noisy with a child screaming all the night in the room beside as if he was in my room . My toilets were backed -up and i have been told it was normal , i just had to insist on .
I will never come back.",2,2016,04,21
245,Super quiet - First Class,"Had a very restful sleep before catching a flight to Texas after a 3 week holiday in Ireland.  Totally recommend this hotel!!!  The rooms were super quiet for being at an airport, beds were top notch and breakfast was excellent.  Cannot imagine anything better!

Deana",5,2016,04,21
245,"Convenient, clean and comfortable","Good experience here, checked in late ish (10pm), friendly staff at reception, checked out early (5am), again friendly staff, efficient check out and the complimentary shuttle bus. Really nice touch that they had fruit and drinks out in the reception area, as it was too early for breakfast, to take with you to the airport.
Good wireless.  Comfortable bed.  Clean.  Bit pricey (160 Euro but booked late ish)",4,2016,04,21
245,Worst Hotel I have ever stayed at,"When we were going here we thought that it would be a great choice since it was close to airport and the only downfall would be the planes flying overhead. Before I continue this was our last night on our trip and that we were only staying here for 1 night. When we got there we already turned in our rental car so we couldn't go into the city for dinner so we ate at the hotel. All we got was pizza (which came out burnt), onion rings, and drinks and it was the most expensive meal of our 10 day trip! Then when we got back to our room the toilet didn't flush. They didn't fix this problem and we had to go to our friends room if we had to go which was very awkward for us. When we went to bed it felt like they just put a sheet over the springs. I didn't get any sleep until 2 o'clock at night. Then at 4:30 in the morning the cleaning crew CAME INTO MY ROOM WHILE I WAS SLEEPING! Worst hotel ever I hope the manager sees this review so they can fix this and actually be somewhat respectable. That concludes my review, overall this hotel is trash.",1,2016,04,20
245,Convenient to airport and transportation,"PROS:
- Short walk or (free) shuttle ride from airport
- Several bus lines connect to city center
- Clean & modern
- Easy check in/out
- 2 Euro plugs in room (forgot UK adapters)
- Beds pretty comfortable
- OK wifi

CONS:
- Shower not enclosed. Had one of those partial dividers on hinges we've seen all over Europe. If you're not careful and alone, you're going to get a lot of water on the bathroom floor. There were also some mildew/mold/stains in the grout between tiles below the shower controls. This was disappointing as the rest of the room/hotel seemed clean/modern.",4,2016,04,20
245,Noisy Nite,"There for business but had family members with me. I had an early flight and needed to be in airport for 4 am.
The disappointing experience is due to room at the back overlooking the recycling area of the hotel. 
There was a lot of noise from truck collecting waste and crushing glass. Also a lot of noise coming from the corridor as drunk people were messing with a shopping trolley.",3,2016,04,20
245,Lowest Radisson experience ever,"I've been in many Radisson hotels all around the world. Basically, I'm a fan of Radisson. But this one was the lowest experience and lowest value for money ever. The cleanliness, the comfort of the room is not appropriate for this category of hotels. There is no Minibar in the room. The hotel bar keeper refused to provide drinks 10 minutes before closing. After midnight food and drinks can only be ordered via room service. But they don't have even a Guiness for room service. Several Food items on the room service menu were not available. Lousy performance for a Radisson! I'll never go there again and can only advise all people who read this not to book this hotel.",3,2016,04,19
245,Excellent overnight stay,"Efficient, friendly check-in, rate included breakfast for two and unlimited wi-fi. Very comfortable room and bed. Easy walk from/to terminal 2, although frequent shuttle available on a 24 hour basis if you have heavy bags.",5,2016,04,19
245,Few days of good rest!!!,"It was very handy for airport and the view to the airport in the morning when the sunrise  was very beautiful! The room was clean and comfortable!
The staff was nice and positive !!! I enjoyed very much! Thankyou!",5,2016,04,19
245,"Bad smell in room, I feel like we should have been offered a discount for the night. $165. Was a lot to pay under those",been given a discount under those circumstances. I feel like it was an isolated incident and not the normal thing for this hotel. The hotel is in a very good location and made it very easy to use the airport the next day.,4,2016,04,19
245,Good experience,"Nice and big rooms
Good service
Talent smiling staff
Near airport
Free shuttle from to airport
Good variety of food for breakfast and lunch
If I visit Dublin again I certainly will go there one more time
Thanks",5,2016,04,19
245,Poor value for money and in need of refurbishment,"I have had to rate this as poor despite the location to the airport and the receptionists who were very pleasant and helpful, the breakfast was delicious but the room I was given was a total let down for the standard of the hotel.  I paid €150 for 1 night with no breakfast!  The room was dirty in corners and behind everything, the bathroom was very dirty with ingrained black (mould or dirt?) around the taps, bath handles, shower head, corners, tiles etc.  It was obviously a disabled access room but the safety rail in the bathroom was wobbly and the screw was not secure in the wall - very dangerous.  There was a tile missing behind the toilet and it was filthy underneath.  This is just negligent cleaning and safety and poor housekeeping.  The bed was clean and comfortable after I'd got over feeling squeamish in the bathroom.

I've stayed at other Radissons and always had a good experience, so come on Dublin Airport management, stop being lazy and get up to standard!

A few little necessary improvements could make a big difference to my view of this hotel.",2,2016,04,19
245,"Clean, Comfortable room, Good service, efficient bus to terminal, but food expensive and poor.","Radisson Blue in Dublin airport was an overnight rest stop before we flew to Berlin. Hotel was of the usual good, reasonably priced quality and service I expected of a Rad Blu hotel. However, food was of poor quality and overpriced. Partner had Irish stew, which is a simple dish to get right, especiually in Ireland. However, the meat was fatty and of poor quality, stew weak and flavourless, and poorly presented. Ditto a Cajun chicken burger, which was poorly spiced, with bland nondescript vegetables and relish. Hardly authentic. Worse, the burger bun, which is a carrier for meat, filling etc.. fell apart immediately, and was of very poor quality. Leaving me with a mess and essentially a chicken salad. Fries were also paltry- more akin to a fast food restaurant. Both meals were overpriced and not consistent with the overall quality of the hotel. However, we did not let this spoil our otherwise pleasant and functional stay.",3,2016,04,19
245,Accidental Visit,"After a very harrowing day with Aer Lingus, who cancelled our flights and were couldn't care less about their customers, we ended up staying at your hotel that night as our flight to the US was cancelled. The Radisson was excellent in every way, the service was great, so was the food, and the room was comfortable and very clean",5,2016,04,19
245,Great location and great hotel,"Very good hotel and service. I have come back several times now and am happy to be greeted with ""welcome back"". The rooms are well insulated and quiet, clean and comfortable, and there is a regular shuttle bus to both terminals of the airport, which is close enough to walk if unencumbered by baggage. Good restaurant and a peaceful lounge. Only draw-back : breakfast is a bit on the expensive side, better value in one of the cafés at the airport itself.",5,2016,04,19
245,Very overpriced,"Having stayed in hotels in and around Dublin on numerous occasions I would have to say this is my worst experience 
I found it to be a very overpriced hotel and having come from the hospitality industry myself I can't believe a hotel of the raddison stature that you run out of food which is on your menu on a daily basis..very dissatisfied with my stay.",3,2016,04,19
245,Good airport hotel.,This was a good hotel. Shuttle drivers went out of their way. Desk staff helpful. The little cafe was actually pretty good and rooms were comfortable. All encounters with staff of any sort pleasant and helpful. The breakfast buffet was exceptional. Liked that cranberry smoothie.,5,2016,04,19
245,Useful but tired,"Useful airport hotel.
Room was ok but looking worn and tired. 
Restaurant service was good if a little slow and food prices where fairly steep as expected at an airport hotel. Staff in the restaurant where very helpful and polite. Staff on reception where mixed. ",3,2016,04,19
245,"Convenient, not valuable","Room was comfortable and convenient to Dublin airport, but quite expensive when looking at other comparable properties in the area. 

Restaurant food was okay, but probably the worst food I had during my 10 days in Ireland.  Again, food was not bad, but it also was not very good. 

I'd stay here again out of convenience if the other nearby properties were again sold out. ",3,2016,04,19
245,Bit of a time wharp,"Hotel reception / bar / breakfast all good and very presentable.  Was in a Business executive room - very outdated, bit of a 70's throwback and needs some updating.  Not as noisey as you would think being at the airport.  Free shuttle to the terminals.",3,2016,04,19
245,Airport Hotel,"Excellent service in the hotel.  Friendly staff, who very helpful with a late check-in and dealing with our young and tired kids.
Convenient location.  Journey to Dublin Airport Terminal Buildings took less than 5 minutes, using the free hotel provided 24-hour shuttle bus service.  Also located very near the hire-car facilities, who drop off directly to the hotel in their free shuttle bus (journey took less than 10 minutes).  We would use this hotel again as it was so convenient for early morning flights.",5,2016,04,19
245,Not a great experience,"The hotel itself is fine, comfortable room and good breakfast.  But been left standing waiting for a bus at 11.00pm for 30mins (having called them on arrival to be assured one was on its way, and then only to be rescued by the bus from the adjacent Maldron hotel) did nothing for my good impressions of this hotel - particularly when added to by a queue at check in, and the slowest possible process, at 11.30pm.   There are plenty of hotels at Dublin Airport, this was not particularly cheap, and you may be better trying a different one.",2,2016,04,19
245,Price,"Over priced hotel stay, was overpriced by about 40€ so that would bring the price down to 140€ which for one night would be max €€€€€€€€€€
Have stayed in hotels off higher standards and paid more. 
It's only location by airport that is the only reason for staying there pure and simple.",4,2016,04,19
245,Not the service I have had there before,"A little dissappointed , this time staying at the Radison at Dublin airport . I have stayed at this airport in the business class on more than a half a dozen occasions . Unfrtinately this trip , I found my room was not very clean , the lights did not work in the room , the bed sheets looked like they were not changed from the previous customer.
I stop down at the restaurant to have dinner and the wait was ridiculous , I waited well over and house for a bowl of fish chowder ( which was great ) and for an Irish burger. Although the food was good I feel waiting over an hour for food in unacceptable .  I will stay there again as I am assuming that this was an isolated incident , if it isn't then I will most fm definitely look for another airport to stay at ",2,2016,04,19
245,Average hotel- not a Blu standard.,"Very average -  not what I expected from a Radisson Blu classed hotel. Much better available. Staff were good, but the accommodation and hotel were nothing special. The bathroom was average. My advice is stay somewhere nicer, Dublin is a small city with good road network with minimal traffic if you are catching an early flight. So cast your net wider, so you can enjoy a better night in a nicer hotel. I fact I d scay this hardly constitutes as a ""Blu"" hotel. ",3,2016,04,19
245,Too expensive for poor services,"This was recommended by an airline and the rooms were old, small, student like accommodation. No doorman service available on and breakfast tray outside our room that was still there on check out. General bad experience",1,2016,04,19
245,Dublin Airport Hotel,The place is good for speedy Internet and easy shuttle to the Dublin Airport. Nearby Classic Irish Pub and authentic fish and chips. The beer is of course Geness but I made beer for 7 years and the beer for me is Southwich's. The Gueness is for locals like a Budwiser Lite or a Coors Lite in the United States. The gutsy beer is by far the Southwich's and less expensive. I do not know the alcohol content of either. The room hot tea selection is good. I prefer the Earl Gray because i am familiar with it from the states.  The tea pots in Ireland are better than in the US though. Several cups of boiling water in seconds. They don't mess around here over boiling water.,5,2016,04,16
245,Very handy for Airport but isolated from Local pubs and shops,"Stayed 5 nights over St Patricks celebrations in Dublin. Staff were all very friendly in particular Maria, a charming young lady from Romania and the courtesy bus driver. Maria was so polite and helpful (e.g. bus advice to travel to Swords and Dublin City Centre). By the way Travel Tip - always have exact fare in coins for the local buses.
Rooms were nice enough.
Buffet breakfast – absolutely delicious – best I have had in Dublin for many a year.
You can see terminal two from main road near to the hotel.
Disadvantages – no shops or local pubs within walking distance – we usually got the bus into Town and then made a day of it, later arriving back to the hotel by taxi.
Hotel bar -  a bit dated and lacked atmosphere.
We had a couple of late nights (over indulging on the Guinness) and left room in the afternoon and no room service took place which wasn’t too much of a hardship as I was sharing with my brother.
Biggest drawback was no safe in the room – we had to place our stuff including passports in central safe near reception.",4,2016,04,16
245,Outstanding ,"I stayed here with my husband on the 15th of April and found everything about the stay to be perfect. Peter from the bar was outstanding and made sure that all our requests were met. He really saw none of our requests as too big or too small. He was even so kind as to recommended places for us to visit when we go to Dublin, and he gave us information on what bus to get from the airport and where we should eat when exploring the city. He was by far the most stand out part of our stay. We will definitely be back and hope to see Peter on our next travel!!",5,2016,04,16
245,Terrible,Terrible room service.  After a late night check in I've been waiting over an hour for food.  If had any idea it would take this long I'd have went to sleep.  Not even a number to call to enquiry.  Sink leaks.  Worst hotel experience I've had in years and only been here 2 hours!!!  Do not stay here if you want good service!,1,2016,04,15
245,stop over for flight to Vegas next day,"very happy with service, room, cleaniness, comfortable bed, generally happy with room, friendliness of staff, service in the bar. Never ate here so can't comment. Would definately recommend stopping here,",5,2016,04,15
245,Disappointing,"Stayed for two nights in April 2016. Disappointing.

- Took two calls to get the courtesy bus to collect us from the terminal in the early hours. We waited for over 15 minutes, which considering hot close the hotel is to the airport, is pretty poor

- Room felt tired, particularly the bathroom (see photos) shoddy repairs, blackened grout etc.

On the upside, the breakfast was excellent, even if the service was slow (Delores had finished her breakfast before Jeb's coffee arrived). The free grab and go breakfast early morning was also a nice touch.

We'd paid more for the Radisson as we wanted something better than the average airport hotel. Sadly, this isn't it.",3,2016,04,14
245,"Nice, easy place",We stayed at the Radisson Blu our last night in Ireland as it was easy to drop off the rental car the night before our departure and stay at a hotel close to the airport.  Very quiet considering the proximity to the airport.  Easy check in/out and a shuttle to the airport in the morning made it the perfect choice.,4,2016,04,14
245,World Traveler ,"I have stayed in this hotel at least 4 times per month . All I can say is the staff are professional and courteous to everyone . My room was clean and what I expected .  They have all the information you need and where to go if you should chose to going into Dublin city center . The car service provided was reasons and at least 25% , than what the fate back from the city was. 
The convenience of the hotel and the proximity to the airport is perfect for me.  The only thing I wished they had was a small shops were you could buy sweets and maybe last
Minute odds and ends . ",5,2016,04,14
245,A comfortable stay generally,"Overall the hotel is generally good and is the right price for accommodation.  What lets it down is the windows in the hotel rooms, during my stay, it was very windy and if it wasn't for the curtains, I would have slept in a wind tunnel!  Every hotel now communicate about saving water and if the towel can be used again, then please do so.  If the windows were replaced over a period of time, then they would save thousands of euros on heating.",3,2016,04,14
245,Wonderful customer service,"Polite, friendly, above and beyond service.  When my bank cards wouldn't work, they called my bank and took me back to the local bank at the airport. They checked in with me and made sure I was alright.",5,2016,04,12
245,Very smart,"This is a lovely hotel, high spec. It is well located for everything - sight-seeing, restaurants & nightlife, plenty of choice nearby.
A very comfortable bed. The staff were very friendly and attentive.",4,2016,04,12
245,Good business hotel next to airport,Stayed here during an overnight stopover in Dublin. The hotel was clean and staff helpful. My bed was comfortable and the shuttle to and from the airport made my layover easy. Recommended if you have an overnight layover or an early morning flight. Thanks!,5,2016,04,12
245,Recent Stay,"The room was excellent and the attendant facilities were also pretty good save for the coffee maker which unfortunately did not work.
Parking costs were excellent and the airport shuttle was excellent",4,2016,04,12
245,Good value airport hotel,Spacious Junior Suite with a great view from the Panorama window. Bigger and more modern bathroom would be great. Thanks to bartender Alexander - great  service! You saved us at the night bar!  Nice breakfast!,4,2016,04,12
245,Love this hotel,Great two nights here. Sadly the bar staff ignored us the second stay we had. We waited 10 minutes trying to get their attention Everything else about this place is magic! The bed was so comfortable Best vit was the proximity to the airport Just brilliant,4,2016,04,12
245,10 April 2016 - VEGAS,"Cold room but great hotel perfect for our early morning flight , efficient shuttle to airport , coffee etc available on departure would stay again , bar bit pricey , plenty of staff and very nice , clean and comfortable reasonable price for overnight and 7 day parking . Easy to find and good location to airport. Bathroom only okay , shower was dated . Bus transfer driver exceptionally nice and kind ",4,2016,04,12
245,Excellent and convenient.,Convenient to airport. Excellent facilities. Fabulous breakfast and free bus transfer return to the airport. Staff were attentive and polite. Comfortable bedrooms with excellent facilities. Value for money.,5,2016,04,12
245,Pre flight stay.,"Room was very clean and bed very comfortable. However we could not get some of the lights to come on and had to phone reception. The room was also cold and took quite a while to heat up.
We had a meal in the restaurant and that was excellent. Breakfast was also good.
Staff were friendly also nd helpful.",4,2016,04,11
245,After a late flight...,Management went way above the norm to ensure the stay went well. Hats off to the night porter who drives the shuttle bus and also tends to the rooms to make sure front of house goes well. He's a true hard worker Thankyou ,5,2016,04,11
245,Don't expect an early breakfast,"For an airport hotel not to cater for early risers is crazy, no breakfast available before 7am even though it was paid for. On offer was a cold cup of coffee in the foyer not much good heading for a Trans Atlantic flight.",2,2016,04,11
245,Close to airport,"Good size rooms. This hotel gets a lot of traffic being next to the airport, but the rooms are very comfortable.  Wi-Fi in my room was weak.  I would stay here again due to the proximity the airport.  Very clean 

",4,2016,04,11
245,Radisson,"Little more on kids menu the only flaw,just a bit short on selection, the rooms was perfect with child's cot also provided and then next morning breakfast was brilliant with everything you could ask for,be staying again",4,2016,04,11
245,Great Airport Hotel,"Radisson Blu Hotel in Dublin was a fantastic airport hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful, gave me great advice about exploring the area. Hotel was clean with modern furnishings and a great breakfast. Good value for the money and ease of getting to and from the city centre. 

The only knock was that it was a bit difficult to find the hotel shuttle at the airport, but once I did, all was well.",5,2016,04,11
245,Bad meal,"My mum hasn't been well only out of hospital on sat, we went for a three course meal. My mum and aunt had the smoked salmon, there was an insect in the salad on my mums plate and it really spoiled the atmosphere, my aunt didn't finish her salad and when they replace the salmon my mum couldn't eat it. I understand these things happen but we felt a supervisor r manager should have address it to us. Couldn't believe it didn't come off the meal.
",3,2016,04,11
245,Airport hotel conveniece,Good hotel in a perfect location from the airport with efficient and courteous staff.  There is a courtesy shuttle and the driver went the extra mile in ensuring that I knew which bus to take into Dublin which was quite convenient!,5,2016,04,11
245,Fine for an overnight stop,Bedroom was a little tired and dated. It would be useful to other travellers to have a map for the walking route from the airport terminal. It's not far with hand luggage on a fine day but the crossing points were not so obvious ,3,2016,04,11
245,6th April,"Good stay, efficient and friendly staff, comfortable room, only negative was the lounge area was cold. We had a 2 hour meeting in the lounge in the late afternoon and it was cold. Later that night we returned to the lounge area after dinner and it was freezing. This was the only negative. ",3,2016,04,11
245,"great service, comfortable room","excellent overall. Comfortable, quiet room. Large and spacious. Friendly staff helped me locate my charger when I left it behind! Delicious breakfast too! I would definitely recommend for business and pleasure.",5,2016,04,11
245,Comfortable and friendly airport hotel,The check-in was exceptionally friendly and the room comfortable.  Breakfast was good and varied but the staff should check with diners to see if they need more beverages and they should ask if they want to order from the menu.  I would also recommend seating families with small screaming children in a family designated area.  Shampoo provided in room was excellent quality.,4,2016,04,11
245,"Promising, but left somethings to be desired","This was my 3rd time staying at the hotel.
Positives: Excellent proximity to Dublin airport.  Very friendly & courteous front desk staff.
Negatives: Room was a bit dated. Torn carpet in hallway. Shower was hard to use and had limited hot water.  Bar & restaurant looked promising, but failed to deliver in good service and food quality.",3,2016,04,11
245,Nice Hotel - Pity about the Airport Transfer!,"Let's look at the positive first...

Nice hotel - impressive reception lounge area, pleasant and helpful staff.  Great room (thanks for the free u/g).  Very comfy bed and slept well. 
Breakfast was fine.  I was a late-eater as my flight wasn't until 11.20, so the buffet was starting to 'dry out' a little and the scrambled eggs, as so often, were solid and you could probably bounce them off the floor (but I didn't try...)

Chap who took me back to the airport was great and very efficient.

Now... what spoiled it.....

Arrived quite late previous evening at Airport.  Went to their phone in arrivals hall.  Bad signal, couldn't really hear the girl at the other end and her English was VERY poor.  She told me to 'go out the main exit and turn left and you'll see our pick up point' - which I did - getting soaked in the rain as a result.  No Pickup Point!  Rang back on mobile and she said 'have you walked through the car park and turned left?'  Errr... no... 'cos you didn't TELL me to!!  

Did that - found it eventually.  Guy there had been waiting 30 minutes already.  Rang again.  ""Are you at Zone 8?""  Uhh? - Looked at the car park signs - Zone 0.  No then.  ""You need to be at zone 8"" very very aggressive screamed down the phone.  ""I'm AT tour pickup point""  ""We have two - are you at Zone8??????""   (If they're got two, why is one Zone 8??)

Eventally, found a piece of A4 selotaped to the outside saying ""Zone8""  What on earth???

Driver then turned up.  The other chap said about time as he'd been there 30 minutes and driver got all stroppy and somewhat rude.

Ended up at the hotel, nearly 50minutes after 1st call requesting pickup, soaking wet and in a foul mood as a result of the whole pathetic procedure.  The upgrade and a good shower cheered me up a bit, but not a lot.

As mentioned, other staff and the hotel itself were all fine!  :)",3,2016,04,11
245,"Good, clean and near the airport.","Except the price, all the other was excellent. There are free bus service to pick you up from the airport. The bed was big size and very comfortable (we enjoyed our sleep). The staff was very helpful. 

I recommend it with a slight reservation about the price.

Εκτός από την τιμή, όλα τα άλλα ήταν υπέροχα. Το ξενοδοχείο παρεχει υπηρεσία μεταφοράς από το αεροδρόμιο. Το κρεβάτι ήταν τεράστιο και πολύ άνετο (απολαύσαμε τον ύπνο μας). Το προσωπικό ήταν πολύ εξυπηρετικό.

Το συστήνω με μια μικρή επιφύλαξη για την τιμή. ",4,2016,04,10
245,"ok, but fails where important","This isn't my first stay in the RB chain, and they are usually much better.
As usual, the staff was friendly, the rooms (which seen better days) were comfortable, and available food was ok.
As for the challenges: these began with the shuttle (7 min ride), for which we had to wait for 40 minutes in a freezing Irish night (took us 3 phone calls as well).
Next, the waiter in the hotel restaurant which forgot to verify our payment, and dragged us back from bed to make a payment.
To top this, I had to fight a plumbing system, which couldn't provide a fixed water temperature for a morning shower. which is always a good way to start your day.

It doesn't take much to be a proper airport hotel - provide the basics, and be reliable, and Radisson failed in that.",3,2016,04,10
245,Excellent for service,"We just spent a night here after flying in from Dubai.  Checkin was smooth and efficient.  We had a light meal, just soup and salad, before bed.  It was vey good as was the friendly service.
Breakfast buffet had a huge selection and the best scrambled eggs I have had in a while, smooth and silky. Overall I would highly recommend.  Very convenient shuttle to the airport.",5,2016,04,10
245,Airport convenience,"Radisson Blu is an excellent stopover for early flights out of Dublin.  Overall comfort, clean and efficient for a reasonable price.  Rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Restaurant and bar area fairly large with good service.  Can be crowded at times.  While the restaurant is not open for early departures, arrangements can be made for breakfast and coffee is available for free in the lobby.",5,2016,04,09
245,Good clean AirPort hotel,"Nice Big room, Big bed, clean. Big desk with chair, Big tv, bathtub in The medium size bathroom. Hotel has a nice restaurant with a good selection of food. Hade a good early bird dinner 2 course for only 21 EUR. Staff is very helpful. Free airport shuttle. ",4,2016,04,09
245,OK for one night,"We had a business class room, but the bed was very small. The whole hotel looks aged, but nevertheless is clean.
At the breakfast area it was difficult to find a table which was set or clean. Most of them have been filled with used dishes where the guests already left. Poor service",3,2016,04,09
245,"Surprising, I usually do not like hotel airports","The staff was extremely attentive.  The dining experience was lots of fun for our last night and the children's menu was the best we encountered in Ireland.  Nice, comfy room.  If I were to stay near the airport again, this is the hotel I would choose.",5,2016,04,08
245,One night stay before start of honeymoon,My husband and I stayed here the day before our flight to Cuba. Service was excellent. Room was spacious and clean. Nespresso coffee machine was a bonus. Provide this works body lotion and shampoo which was a nice touch. All services are through the hotel app. Ordered room service through the app and arrived within 20 minutes. Also requested more shampoo via the app and again arrived to door within 10 minutes. I will definitely be staying here again and will recommend to friends and family!,5,2016,04,08
245,Double booked,"On arrival at check in around midnight, I was told, albeit they had my booking, that there were no rooms available....they had sold it... and that they had organised a room at another hotel 20 mins drive away. Taxi driver said that they did this all the time and I was lucky that it was not one of the other hotels they use north of Dublin!! Reason for selecting this hotel was that it is in the airport and I could walk to T2 for early flight ! Suffice to say had sleepless night hoping I would get to airport in time!
WILL NOT BOOK HOTELS AGAIN.",2,2016,04,08
245,Convenient hotel with good service,the hotel is very conveniently located and especially suitable if you have an early morning departure from Dublin Airport.  The hotel provides a complimentary minibus which leaves you off at the terminal doors,4,2016,04,08
245,No points for me...,"Being from out of the country with no phone service, I booked last minute room due to flight cancelation.  Since I used hotels.com, the hotel refused to attach my membership number to reservation. I can name at least 3 other countries  that had no problem adding my awards account under same circumstances..... poor service",2,2016,04,08
245,Does what it says it will do,Good airport hotel with efficient and friendly shuttle service. Bar meal with good Guinness and excellent service. Staff were superb. It isn't somewhere you'd stay too long but that not what its purpose is.,4,2016,04,07
245,"Room was tired,   service excellent. ","Average airport hotel. My room was dated,  and the bed was hard. Everything worked out though. 
The breakfast was really good.  Lots of fresh fruit and juices along with hot breakfast buffet. 
Front desk service was excellent.  I needed some copies,  which I got quickly. +++",3,2016,04,07
245,"Convenient, Comfy and Clean.","Great hotel for an early morning flight or late night arrival. Shuttle service to the airport is so handy...its complimentary and very punctual. Breakfast in the morning is ""help yourself"" from the lobby...water fruit and cereal bars(I think)
Had a bite to eat and a glass of wine in the bar when I arrived and the food was great. staff vert friendly and helpful.
Great value for money too!!",4,2016,04,05
245,Just a stop over,"Only spent one night. Hotel was very clean!!! A bit run down as in the doors and furniture. (I worked in a 5 star hotel and have eagle eyes for this kind of stuff)
I would absolutely stay there again as it is super convenient!!",4,2016,04,05
245,Good service. Dated rooms,"The staff and the resultant service at this hotel is exceptional. Maria was a standout, ever ready to help and walk the extra mile. She even suggested and provided us with umbrellas, for a day out in the city. Deserves a pat on the back and is a credit to the Radisson team. Mohammed was equally good in ensuring that all was well taken care of. The rooms and bathroom could do with some refurbishments, Too bland room for a Radisson standard. Even Jurys Inn is better these days. The bathrooms definitely are old and it shows. But, as I said, the staff deserve applause for their conduct and service avlues.",4,2016,04,05
245,Good Place to stay,"We have searched for a Hotel close to the airport. And we found it in Radisson Blue Hotel. The bar is nice organized and you can choose if you want to have bar atmoshere or a bit quiter place in the seperated room. Food was lovley, price ok. The room was huge & clean.
Really good was the free take away breakfast for early birds.
",4,2016,04,05
245,Nice food shame about the coffee,"Really nice food
Very attentive and professional server 
Coffee (latte) served in ikea-sized mugs and had to pay for two ""this is our standard size ""
Very clean and tidy premises 
Parking free with receipt ",4,2016,04,04
245,Airport stopover,"Good airport hotel with helpful staff let down by bed and pillows 
Restaurant fine and food quite acceptable for time and place
Fix the beds and even more important the pillows and this would be a fine airport hotel",3,2016,04,04
245,huh?,I had to ask the front desk about diapers/nappies and the three girls up front looked at me with blank expressions. Then one of them told me to go to the convenience store down the street that was out,2,2016,04,04
245,Comfortable room,"Comfortable room, close to airport with shuttle was good. The shuttle driver was very pleasantly Irish! Had to come into hotel, when arriving to check in, to ask for help with luggage but desk lady promptly responded.",4,2016,04,04
245,Good business hotel very close to airport,"Good enough hotel, key feature is it is only 5 minutes walk from either of the two Dublin airport terminals.  Excellent staff, breakfast acceptable, rooms good, bathroom a bit tired, but reasonable value for money.",4,2016,04,04
245,A quick visit to Dublin,"I flew to Dublin to watch England Counties U18 play France at Ashbourne Rugby Football Club. Great bus connection to Ashbourne (35/40mins). I stayed overnight so I could spend the next day in Dublin, again many bus links, and flew home that evening. The hotel was welcoming, the room spacious, though the bathroom was rather ""tired"", the restaurant and breakfast room more than adequate.",4,2016,04,04
245,Typical average airport hotel,This is a typical airport hotel. No concern for repeat business. The room was well worn and badly in need of updating. I had a single room yet it had four upright (uncomfortable) chairs but no easy chair. The bed was uncomfortable. The dinner and breakfast were average. Maybe a good Manager could do wonders for this hotel...,3,2016,04,04
245,Medium,"Nice hotel but too old, rooms are quite old, not what you are used to when booking Radisson Blue. However the restaurant & food was good and we appreciated the free shuttle service from the airport to the hotel.",3,2016,04,04
245,Good night's rest,"This was an excellent a stopover before catching a very early flight. The staff were very helpful, the shuttle ran every 15 minutes and was excellent, and the food hit the spot. Definitely would stay here again .",4,2016,04,04
245,Comfortable stay - as expected,"Clean tidy room. First floor seems to be the family floor. No issues with noise. I heard some children in corridor but noise was very well insulated. 
Climate control works. Bed was soft but very supportive. Great sleep.

Breakfast was fine. Nothing amazing but was included in my rate. 

Shuttle was easy and handy to airport.",4,2016,04,03
245,Overnight stay for an early morning flight,"We stayed at the Raddison Dublin airport on March 16th as our flight to the Phillipines was very early on March 17th. Had a lovely dinner in the restaurant, and a drink. The service was very good, staff poite and the food delicious. The room was spacious with 2 queen size beds and they were very comfortable. It was handy to have the free shuttle to the airport terminal included in the booking also.",5,2016,04,02
245,Handy for airport,A few mins from terminals 1and 2. Courtesy coach every 15min. Rooms generally very clean. Breakfast has good selection but plates would be better hot for the cooked food. No coin op machines for drink or food and no minibar. Staff friendly and helpful.,4,2016,04,02
245,Great Stay,"Stayed here recently. Lovely hotel, and really nice staff, the rooms were so big and lovely touch with the dressing gown. 
had Dinner in the restaurant, great food but was really stuck me what how polite and helpful the staff were. ",4,2016,04,01
245,Over night stay 23/03/2016,We had an overnight stay 23 March 2016 on route to New York.  Had an evening meal which was very good. The room was fine and all staff courteous and helpful. An early start meant we were first into breakfast at 6.30 the next day.  Unfortunately this was very disappointing - I ordered a pot of decaf coffee and got tea - the cooked breakfast was cold.  This was pointed out at the time and we were told the usual chef was off?  As we had very limited time we left hungry and annoyed.  I would also like to point out that nothing seemed to be done to enable later guests to enjoy a hot breakfast.,4,2016,03,31
245,Unexpected stay,"After missing a connecting flight to the United States I found myself staying at the Radisson near the Dublin airport.  Since I wasn't feeling well to boot, I was not in the best of moods when I checked in.  However, once I reached the room and got into the bed.........I relaxed.  The bed was awesome and I didn't want to get out of it, lol!  Very comfortable and I slept all afternoon and evening.  ",5,2016,03,31
245,Location is by far the best feature,"Location wise, you couldn't get better. They offer a courtesy bus service from terminal 2, but rather than stand and wait for it, we opted to walk; it was literally less than 10 minutes, you can see the hotel from the airport. Turn right out of T2 (or walk to T2 from T1), walk to the very end of where the bus stops/taxis/drop off is and you will see the hotel. Go over the crossings and you are literally there.

Check-in was robotic and uneventful. We were actually quite surprised for a Radisson, We've generally received a much warmer welcome in other Radisson hotels. We were told we were very welcome at the hotel without so much as a smile, it was very insincere.

The room itself was ok, we booked a Business Class room, which was big and had a view out over the airport, but it was bland in decor and the bathroom looked very dated. We like minimalist, tasteful decor which is what we usually find in hotels, but this was just bland and lacked any warmth.

The shower was a little disappointing, judging by the Mira branded control knob, it was a concealed electric shower which wasn't very powerful.

Breakfast was ok, we only ate from the hot buffet and it wasn't particularly notable. The sausages tasted cheap, there were no fried eggs, just scrambled, it just really didn't stand out. We've paid far less for much better.

We spent some time in the T3 bar, and I have to say, the staff were fantastic here. The service was quick, they were chatty and overall friendly. Definitely the most stand out part of our stay.

We would stay here again, but the hotel unfortunately didn't meet our expectations based on other Radisson hotels we have stayed in.",3,2016,03,30
245,Great stay,Bedrooms very quiet considering noise from road and air traffic just outside. Adjustable air con in the room. Fantastic range of food and drinks for breakfast. Very friendly courtesy coach driver! Lovely range of individual guest toiletries.,4,2016,03,29
245,Great place for before traveling ,Checked into this hotel which is so very convenient to the airport. Noise is not a factor at all. Carmen at the front desk could not have been any friendlier and helpful with all of my traveling questions. She was so professional and accommodating that I felt so welcome and that all information was correct given to me. Hope that my travels allow me to come back to radiation blu in Dublin again. ,5,2016,03,29
245,Business trip,"Very good location and breakfast.
Rooms are basic for this price level and would need renewal. Hearing  system was not working...location is very good, closed to terminal and perfect for early flights. Breakfast is very good if you can enjoy It.",3,2016,03,29
245,An excellent hotel in the airport grounds.,"The atmosphere, staff, food and decor are way above an airport hotel, it is rather a very good hotel beside an airport. The staff from the moment you walk through the door to check out were extremely pleasant, helpful and efficient.
The menu in that bar is varied and excellent, especially the chicken wings! An excellent experience.",5,2016,03,29
245,"Convenient to airport, decent amenities","The reason why I did not give a 5 rating is because the amenities were not to the high caliber that I've experienced previously in other Radisson Blu hotels. The bathrooms and bedrooms were in need of updates/furniture upgrades. Overall though, the hotel had a great buffet breakfast and was conveniently located near the airport. Would stay here next time only if I needed to access the airport quickly. The price per night was okay considering that breakfast was included.",4,2016,03,29
245,Convienent to Airport,"Hotel is well kept, rooms are comfortable, even being right next to the airport I'm not kept up all night listening to plains.  The restaurant is good, and you can always catch a taxi to downtown Dublin for about 25 Euro.",5,2016,03,29
245,Hotel freezing,"Checked in 7.30 pm for and early flight. We got an upgrade to a so called business class room as I completed a loyalty card application .
Room was nice enough but the heating wasn't working. We asked for someone to have a look and after two hours we had to call again and eventually a young lad came up and said they were having problems with the new AC system and offered us an electric heater which I refused. We got moved next door. Which wasn't much better. ",3,2016,03,29
245,Great stay before our flights,"We stayed here on Easter Sunday as both my boyfriend and I had to catch flights early on Monday for work.  The staff at the hotel are really friendly and the rooms have everything you need.  We really appreciated the coffee machine and the chocolates left in our room as an Easter treat.  We had dinner in the restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was, my boyfriend really enjoyed his chicken wings. It made such a difference to just go across the road to airport instead of spending 3 hours on the bus from Galway.  Really worthwhile if you have an early flight.  We will definitely be back again.",5,2016,03,29
245,Not up to the Radisson's usual standard,"I usually stay at the Radisson because the group always exceeds my expectations. This time, not so much. The staff were efficient but not particularly pleasant. The room was cold, the fixtures a little out of date, and the bed was uncomfortable. There was only one bath towel in the bathroom, which meant I did not have a second towel to use after having a shower in the evening (to freshen up) and again in the morning. At €125, a one night stay is at the upper end in terms of the cost to stay at airport hotels in Dublin. It won't change my view of the Radisson in general (which is that they are an excellent group) but their Dublin airport offering needs a shakeup. ",3,2016,03,29
245,Perfect end to a trip to Ireland,"As far as airport hotels go, this is one of the best I have stayed in. Very friendly staff, excellent bar/restaurant area and room are of a high standard.   Free shuttle bus service to airport terminal was a bonus. ",5,2016,03,29
245,Radisson at Dublin Airport,"While we only stayed for one night it was a flawless experience, hotel staff were very friendly and polite despite the fact we weren't exactly dressed to impress, they treated us like the would anyone else I feel. Also the flexibility afforded to us when we asked for a different room type, they were so nice about it you would have thought it was their mistake when simply we booked the wrong room type. Breakfast was also very good, nice Irish breakfast with lots of other alternatives available. We seen two different rooms and both were nice but the double room was a bit nicer due to the inclusion of a nice soft leather sofa in that room. And located just a 5 minute walk from T2 its in a good spot. Sorry I'm just filling space to make up the 200 words here to be honest but all I said before this was valid, it was a very nice hotel.",5,2016,03,29
245,2nd stay; not impressed,"Stayed for the second time because it is handy when traveling with kids and the flight is super early in the morning. 

Overall the hotell is dusty and has seen better days. 

A big attraction for us is (or would be) the swimming pool. The first time we stayed we arrived just after 6 pm, the kids all excited to use the pool, only to be told the pool closes at 6. The second stay we drove down ekstra early to make the pool, only to be informed that it closrs at 4:30 on public holidays! Seriously; is that not exactly when the hotel is busy and people want to use the pool?? Very annoying. 

The first time we stayed the room was ok, an sizable enough for four people, but this last visit we had to ask for (and pay) for upgrades twice to avoid staying in a shoebox. 

And little things like when you order breakfast to your room super early because you have a flight to get to, they manage to deliver it late and having mixed up the order. Being a airport hotell you would think basics like that is in order. 

On the plus side; the driver of the complimentary airport bus was nice and helpful. ",3,2016,03,29
245,1916 4 day visit,"Overall excellent, shuttle bus service and staff were 1st class, allowing me to go to and from the City with ease, breakfast was again excellent with a great menu range, front desk staff were superb, But above all was Mohamod, an excellent abassador for the hotel, only to happy to stay there again.",5,2016,03,29
245,Good expérience,"It was calm, breakfast excellent, people Nice, restaurant was good. The hôtel localisation is very good to travel because near the airport.
Room was ok, spacious ans clean. A little problem with the toilet to draw the water ",4,2016,03,29
245,Over priced.,"Room was a poor standard and service in the bar restaurant was very bad.  After agreeing to serve my food out in the lounge area I then got a telling off (proper) for eating there. Forgot cutlery, salt and then forgot my dessert order.  Wouldn't stay again. ",2,2016,03,29
245,Very disappointed considering the price,Considering the average price in Dublin and iraland we were expecting more.  Old rooms and just average clean. Service and personnel and  and shuttle to the airport was good.  We stayed just one night. Actually 10 hours,2,2016,03,29
245,OK stay,"Good hotel overall, fairly convenient for airport although frequent courtesy bus is more practical than walking. Bar and dinner were pretty good. Meeting rooms also good. My issues this time were with fresh paint in the corridor causing a smell in the bedroom and by 9am the breakfast buffet was pretty tired.",3,2016,03,29
245,the best bit is that it is close to the airport,"So firstly, this is a Radisson and normally Radisson hotels at airports are pretty modern  This one used to be another hotel and Radisson took it over. They did some facelifting on it, especially the lobby, but the rooms are only just fine.  There are plumbing issues in the bathroom so that when you turn on the faucet the sound that is emitted is very loud.  The room is standard size.  There is a breakfast room and then to one side most mornings there is a little cafe, further down is a bar.  We had drinks and dinner in the bar.  I am never sure why hotels in Ireland do not serve craft beers, there are so many good ones in Ireland but this one seems to just have the Guiness offshoots.  It is a small point but really, diversify! The food is fine, standard hotel.  So all in all, it is fine but the hotel is expensive for what you get and the only reason it stays in business with these rates is that it is the only one, apart from the Maldron, that is actually at the airport.  You can walk (not pedestrian friendly but do able) to the airport from the hotel.  About 8 minutes to Terminal 2, and about another 5 mins to terminal 1.  There is also a 24 hour shuttle.  The other thing is that the front desk staff really varies on hospitality.  Most are fine but there is always one or two that really seem like they would rather be elsewhere.  Also finally, when front desk staff get asked (from tourists) about the best way to get in to town, please don't give them the taxi option.  It is an expensive and not the wisest option. There are 2 buses that they can take that should be the first thing you suggest with the taxi option as only if needed.  I heard the receptionist get asked this question and after I found the couple and warned them off taxis (can be up to 30 euro!).",3,2016,03,27
245,Not bad,"Stayed here for a week.
Not perfect in general a good hotel.

Staff nice but shame no Irish working here.
(Well I never saw any)

Food was fine but did have the odd meal worse than you would expect.

Good hotel for stopover and easy to get bus into town from airport.

Rooms very clean.",4,2016,03,27
245,Proximity to airport,Solid hotel with a satisfaction guarantee. Give them a chance to fix it and they will. Solid 4 star business hotel with friendly van-shuttles. Access to gym (9-6pm weekends). Very good breakfast was included in our rate worth 15-20 euros. Rooms were solid on par with most 4 star type hotels. Free wifi everywhere.,4,2016,03,26
245,"Great location convenient to the Airport, though a seat in the restaurant is not guaranteed for residents.l","Rooms could benefit from some TLC, the restaurant was off limits due to some group event.  To give staff their due they seemed very overworked with not enough of them in evidence. The motto 'Yes I can' motto was not being adhered to, A little thought from Management who sadly were elsewhere could have done much with just a little thought. All around staff training also needed though a young man called Mohammed stood out for both his helpfulness and cheerfulness - while some others are best suited to back office environments.",3,2016,03,25
245,"Old and trashy, poor service.","Old and trashy, poor service in hotel resturant and pricee. Select another hotel!
Stayed in a business room for one night, brekfast in the foyer for early departure 07:00. Too small buses and a lot of waiting time caused by that.",2,2016,03,24
245,Disappointing,"I stayed in the Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport on March 19th, following a long journey. I took the shuttle bus to the hotel. The driver was wonderful, so helpful and friendly. Unfortunately he was the only staff member who had such a friendly nature. I checked in at 10.00pm and was the only guest in the hotel lobby. The lobby itself was dimly lit and charmless, so first impression was not good.There were 2 ladies working on the reception. The person who dealt with me was efficient but unfriendly and brusk. Her colleague did not even look at me. 

I ordered room service and my meal was delivered very quickly, much to my surprise. It seemed to me that the food had been prepared in advance and reheated. It was very hard and melted cheese on the burger was cold and rock hard. 

The room was quite basic although clean. Again it was totally lacking in charm.

The buffet breakfast was also basic and lacking in the variety that you would find in other hotels. The 2 staff on duty in the restaurant were business like but a smile and a ""good morning"" greeting would help to make it a more pleasant experience. The actual restaurant itself was more like a cafeteria.

I paid 199 Euro for the room and 26 Euro for room service. This was not good value for thexperience I had. I would not recommend the Radisson Blu.",2,2016,03,24
245,"Standard airport hotel, nothing special","Very handy for the airport. They provide a shuttle bus but its is within walking distance of both terminals. Reasonable value for money. Rooms a bit basic. Breakfast - food quality fine, service a little slow for tea/coffee.",3,2016,03,24
245,Ideal hotel for an early flight,"Stayed 1 night before an early departure to the US. Pat, the duty driver picked us up at Zone 8 outside of arrivals and kept us entertained on the short drive to the hotel. Free shuttle runs 24 hrs a day. Beautiful business class room with views of the airport, many thanks to Vincent and Imelda on reception for their service.
",5,2016,03,23
245,Superb 👌🏼,"The nicest hotel I've stayed in a long time I will definitely be back but hopefully it will be for a longer stay to make the most of the great amenities and atmosphere on offer, very well presented, super friendly staff! Top notch 👌🏼",5,2016,03,23
245,Very nice overall experience,"Excellent accommodation and very helpful personnel at all times. 
Definitely I would choose the hotel for my next business trip.   If they could have a small king of gymnastic room inside the hotel and not nearby, would have been perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",5,2016,03,23
245,Overnight,"The hotel was very nice, very comfortable - the room was large, full bath, and many channels on the tv. Free wifi and free shuttle service to airport made it even better. The cost was inexpensive. The hotel restaurant T3 was very nice. The staff were friendly. Well worth it. I may continue to use Radisson Blu as I travel.",5,2016,03,23
245,poor service in  bar restaurant in eveing,"I was staying for one night before a early flight was traveling on my own and waited a long time to order my food and also   for services and also to pay my bill. food was of good stranded when it arrived.. 
",2,2016,03,22
245,Good hotel,"I found the Radisson to be a pleasant hotel with comfortable beds. The bathrooms can use updating as the bath panel was hanging off! The cleaning staff were lovely. The restaurant is decent, but some of the servers weren't aware that kids under 12 eat for free with a paying adult! I felt uncomfortable having to inquire about it, they need to be better informed! I appreciate the servers are busy and work hard. Overall it's a good hotel to stay at, it was my third visit staying a few nights each time in the last six months, so it must be good enough!",4,2016,03,22
245,Perfect location,"Good location for stopover when arriving late at the AirPort of leaving early. Room was Large, good bed and pillows. There was no atmosferen in lobby , bar orcrestaurabt. Breakfast great  in choice and service. ",3,2016,03,22
245,O'MALLEY wedding,we had folks meet us in the bar restaurant and the staff were friendly. Then we moved to a table for dinner. The menu choices suited everyone and the prices are reasonable. The room was spacious and exactly what we needed after a long trip.,5,2016,03,22
245,Full of great surprises,"It was my first time staying at the Radisson, and I was impressed about the details and services offered to the guests. The front desk lady was super friendly and offered a room upgrade for me. I really enjoyed the bottle of water and Nespresso in the room, and the free treat, which for me was a desert. The early morning ""coffee, fruits, and cereal bars"" at my checkout was just an amazing final touch at my experience with the Radisson. The 24/7 airport shuttle was also a decisive factor in choosing the Radisson. They won me over, and Radisson will become my first choice from now on.",5,2016,03,22
245,Perfect for an early flight,"This hotel is a great location for the airport - there is a minibus to take you to the terminal but you can easily walk in about 3 minutes.  It was comfortable and quiet in the hotel and I was up at 5am for a flight - there was express checkout and some breakfast waiting in the lobby, all allowing that important extra few minutes in bed!! Would recommend for airport stays - staff friendly and helpful too :-)",4,2016,03,22
245,Great stay,"Definitely stay here again  
Stayed here prior to a night out in Dublin on St Patricks day!!! Good choice of food from the bar area. Room was clean , I did think as we were so close to the airport we may have heard the planes but it was very quiet .
Breakfast was plentiful , lovely friendly staff . ",5,2016,03,22
245,Nice Stay,Shower not very powerful. Room ok but toilet to close to the wall in the bathroom. The food was good and we had very good service from a young lady with dark hair Think she was Polish and she was very polite and attentive.,4,2016,03,22
245,Convenient to Dublin Airport,Nice hotel with great service.  Good food.  Overall my room was very clean.  Good value.  Shuttle to airport every 15 min.  Will stay there again when visiting Dublin.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone needing close access to the airport and rental cars.,4,2016,03,21
245,Ideal hotel for travellers,Fault free.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Room spotless.  Breakfast gave you many options to choose from.  Ideal location for travelling either out of the country or for staying on arrival into Ireland,5,2016,03,21
245,Good Hotel for a Stopover,"Shuttle from Arrivals set the tone.Picked up by a courteous  driver who took our luggage straight to Reception. Check -in was quick and our room was spacious,well furnished and quiet . Bed was really comfortable . Following morning's breakfast was excellent-good quality food .",4,2016,03,20
245,Perfect place for early mining departure,Stayed here as we had an early departure the next morning. Quick check in. Comfortable room. Decent enough bar for airport hotel. Airport transfer excellent. They had two vehicles running at 4:30am. Easy walking distance to terminal building.,5,2016,03,19
245,Easy Choice for a Dublin layover,"The hotel is clean and nicely appointed. The staff was A+. The bed was comfortable. We weren't there long enough to try the food or any other services. 
Room for improvement...
The room could have been quieter. When the next room checked it at 2AM it sounded like they were at the foot of the bed.
I'd trade the useless towel warmer for another plug in the main room that could charge my electronics.
The shower had a large tub with both a hand held and a wall shower head. ( Hey hotels when you remodel loose the tub, I know of no one that wants to sit in them and many that hate having to climb up and in them). The handheld only pointed one direction...up and out and neither of us could get water coming from the wall unit. Perhaps a small instruction card?! I'm sure the ceiling will eventually dry. 
With all of the gloss on the Radisson Blu web site and the touting of walking distance from the Dublin Terminals (which they are) they could have provided a walking map or a few sentences of directions for tired travelers.  Same goes for the pickup Bus service. Do I call at 1 AM or hope and wait outside?",4,2016,03,19
245,Poor ,Very disappointed with the service in this hotel . Arrived to a queue at reception . We had paid for 2 cars in the car park but they could only validate the ticket for one car that night as they did not have enough  suitable tickets for both cars . Food in restaurant was poor and the only table large enough for 5 was in a cut off section from the rest of the bar area . Upon our return at 10 pm on the Thur night we had to wait 25 min for their 15 min shuttle service which only arrived after I rang the hotel to send it and my husband had to queue at reception again ( waisting more time ) to have his ticket validated before he could leave  the car park .,1,2016,03,19
245,nice room,"Lovely spacious room with a work desk.Arrived late & gone early the following morning so I didn't spend much time there. Only negative was that I wanted a bath & the plug didn't fit,water kept draining out so I didn't bother in the end.",4,2016,03,18
245,business trip,"This hotel has good location within the airport. Rooms are large and well appointed. There is a regular pick up from the main terminals, but this is not as frequent as it could be and you could spend a while (as I have) in the cold and wet waiting for the minibus. Once in the hotel the restaurant is frequently crowded, always noisy, and with mediocre service standards. One great thing is the breakfasts, which  serve the best Irish bacon and sausages I have ever tasted.
 However, overall the whole place lacks atmosphere and is best regarded as a 1 night stayover hotel with basic amenities.",4,2016,03,17
245,quick stopover,arrived in to the hotel wrecked from flight- bed very comfortable and inviting- room/corridor quiet. just what you need.- after a long flight.. breakfast lovely. stay unfortunately all too short. great to be able to lave car there while we were away,5,2016,03,17
245,enjoyable,"nice room and handy for airport staff friendly . good pressure in the shower, plenty hot water and towels. the bar staff were helpful and friendly and a nice place to have a quiet drink before retiring for the night",4,2016,03,16
245,"Very nice hotel, very friendly staff and good food","Room was lovely spacious and clean, the airport shuttle was very convenient and never had to wait long. We were able to check in when we arrived at 10am. The food in the hotel restaurant was very nice and reasonably priced.  ",5,2016,03,16
245,"perfect location, dated rooms, bad restaurant....","The location is perfect for a late night arrival at Dublin airport; the rooms are very dated, to an almost unacceptable level (70s). The restaurant is bad, no other attribute possible. The fish'n chips was the worst I ever had, pre made convenience, bad taste, dripping of fat, chewy soft chips. Not recommended.",3,2016,03,16
245,Paris valentines,"Radisson Blu airport hotel is a perfect place to stay before flying out if Dublin airport. The facilities are perfect, reception is professional and fast. Airport transfer bus is another bonus. Great place to stay.",5,2016,03,16
245,Conference visit,"Meeting rooms, meals and banquet were top class. Service was first rate and staff were always available to assist. Food quality and presentation was of a very high standard. Conference facilities, including IT equipment were ip very good.",4,2016,03,16
245,Excellent experience,"Staywd here for 1 night due to early morning flight.  Location was excellent. Room was clean and comfortable, I particularly liked the nespresso machine! Bar food and drink were very good in terms of quality and service, altogether a faultless experience, and I would definitely recommend this hotel",5,2016,03,16
245,"close to airport, good for overnight","good shuttle service. difficult to walk from airport to hotel though if you do not want to wait - the walking path is somewhat circuitious. reasonable choice in restaurant, but does not accept Amex card. good comfortable rooms. excellent grab and go complimentary breakfast. car parking at hotel is not free.",4,2016,03,16
245,Long in the Tooth,"You stay here for one reason and that is proximity to the airport. The rooms are getting a little long in the tooth. The hotel restaurant/bar is ok, but nothing special, and the service always seems a little slow. Shuttle to the airport is very reliable.",3,2016,03,16
245,Business trip,"Staff are amazing, food is excellent, room service was excellent.
Two minutes from the airport.
Rooms are clean.
Can't fault it I'd stay there again on pleasure.
Reception is excellent, lady remembered me from the week previous which I thought was a lovely touch. Staff make this hotel",5,2016,03,16
245,I do not recommend this hotel,"The Radisson Blu Hotel was not nice at all.  I stayed one night traveling on business, and would not recommend it to anyone.  
Upon arrival I was checked in, and though the staff was courtious, I received my room key to a low floor, even though I had requested a high floor; however, I was accommodated and re-booked.  I stayed on the top floor; which was nice, but the room was quite old and in need of renovation.  It looked like the room had fresh paint; but it was paint on top of old wood and etc.  The bathtub had pink mold around the calking, the bed was terrible and once I layed down on one side, it had a permanent dent, and I had to lay sideways so my head was raised a bit.  The temperature was difficult to figure, and I never heard the air even come on.  The towel warmer was barely warm, so no warm towl. The worst was the toilet that would not flush.  It took 10 times of pumping before it would flush.
I tried to get dinner; however, there was a convention of some sort, and only the buffet was open, and lines and lines of people were waiting to get food.  I had to wait until 7pm before I could get a bite to eat, so I didn't bother and just went to my room.  Needless to say....I literally didn't sleep at all that night, and was more than happy to leave and catch my flight the next day.
The hotel is in real need of renovation.",2,2016,03,16
245,functional - great staff,"I use this hotel regularly when flying out Dublin early. Food is ok, staff are great, rooms functional clean and comfortable. I know I will be staying again in the near future, but know what I will be getting as they are very consistent.",4,2016,03,16
245,Horrific,"It was mentionned on the Radisson website a swimming pool and a SPA. But in fact you have to walk very far to go there. And the swimming pool was closed during our journey. Scandalous, the price was very high and we didn't even had the access to the swimming pool. We had a water cut-off in the morning and an electric drill in the afternoon to fix it. For one week-end staying there, I can tell you it wasn't a 4* hôtel at all. There was dirts on a lot of furnitures. In the bathroom too. The only good point was the proximity of the airport. But there are a lot of hotels much better and much cheaper.",1,2016,03,16
245,good,Supervisor in restaurant was exceptionally rude when there was a mix up but the other waiting staff were perfect and very helpful. Rooms warm and comfortable. Conference rooms very cold. Food very good. ,4,2016,03,16
245,Good for overnight before flight,"Much better than the Clarion across the way.
Overall, really liked the hotel. Bed was v comfy. Reception staff very nice. Would just have a minor issue with the cleanliness of the room-wasn't up to standard. Also, the room was very cold (cold nose). I didn't complain about this as I had a very early flight and didn't want to be delayed from getting to bed. I'm sure I would have been accommodated. ",4,2016,03,16
245,Business Trip - airport convenience,"Perfect location if you have an early morning flight. Good restaurant...food and service, both dinner and breakfast.  Friendly staff. I had been warned that the check-in process was slow...but mine was fast and perfect. I was surprised that the heat in the rooms did not come on until midnight...it was great that they offer free portable heaters....but I wish someone would have told me as the first hour or so in my room was very cold.",4,2016,03,16
245,Expectation met,"My stay is what one would expect from a Radisson.
Spacious room.comfortable bed and fast WI Fi .
Breakfast was good. and breakfast staff were friendly and efficient.
Reception was business like and helpful.",5,2016,03,16
245,Dublin Airport Hotel,"Lovely convenient hotel close to the Terminals.
Nice size room with a quality coffee maker and comfortable bed.
A handy grab and go breakfast snack and drink was available in the reception which was convenient for an early departure and a courtesy mini bus was available to transport us to the terminal. ",4,2016,03,16
245,Fine hotel for the airport,"No problems, room was tastefully decorated.
I had no problems with noise. 
I didn't use the restaurant.
The shuttle bus service was quick and easy, though the loud disco music on the bus at 6.45am was hard on the ears!",4,2016,03,16
245,business as usual,"nice hotel, excellent location to the airport. Been stay at this hotel on and off for the past 5 years, it does however show the sign of usage on the furniture and the room, the hotel can use an update. the staffs are always nice and helpful that's a big plus. ",4,2016,03,16
245,Coasting to Mediocrity,"First time at the hotel.  Took advantage of the 32 Euro Business upgrade to take advantage of a larger room, air conditioning and a coffee station.  The room was the same size as standard.  Air conditioning was already offered in Standard.  They refunded my upgrade fee with apologies.  I felt ripped off",2,2016,03,16
245,my stay...,"Excellent place! been staying here alot for over 2 years now... never had one bad experience... if you want to have the same repeatability, great service and great quality on top - then this is the place to stay :)",5,2016,03,16
245,Jennifer,As usual a relaxing welcoming ambience. Food is good. All staff are polite and very helpful. Only criticism is how the hotel organises the return airport bus system. There does not seem to be one. I hope to return soon.,5,2016,03,16
245,Great Hotel,"I stayed here for a total of 2 nights in February on Business. There was a minibus transfer outside the terminal that we arrived at, admittedly that wasn't a pleasant experience as I had to wait in the cold for this bus. However the fact that Radisson provide this service for free is great. The hotel was very accommodating and comfortable, would recommend to a friend. Wasn't majorly impressed with the food but it was alright. I would visit here again, especially as it's in a convenient location being right at the airport. ",5,2016,03,16
245,Short Stay Dublin Airport,We can't really fault anything - apart from the room being too warm to our tastes. Breakfast was fantastic and staff were friendly and attentive throughout. Really enjoyed our very short stay wish we could have stayed longer. Up to the usual high standards we know from Radisson.,5,2016,03,16
245,"Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport","Hotel was nice, modern, clean and inviting.  Room was very comfortable and spacious.  Only problem was that power outage due to Airport maintenance was hugely inconvenient as the heat went out and there was no hot water when I showered.  ",4,2016,03,16
245,Radisson Blu Dublin,"hotel was clean and tidy, though not as new as it looked in the pictures. Room for some refurbishment in the rooms, though bathroom was clean, tidy and modern. Service was mixed. Front desk ok, room service good, but the bar service was poor. Breakfast was good if a bit pricey at 16 euro per head.",3,2016,03,16
245,Short Trip - it's all good!,"We were on a quick overnight before leaving Ireland. The beds were comfy, the breakfast was comprehensive, the shuttle was quick. What more can you ask for? It's the perfect place to stop for a rest before your flight.",5,2016,03,16
245,Very convenient,"The hotel is perfect for a stop over in Dublín , even more if you have few time or an early flight
Comfortable, quiet and with needed commodities includes a shuttle to the terminal 
REstaurnat & bar are delivering 24x7 meal and drinks, I personally recommend it fro business trips",5,2016,03,16
245,Very pleasent,"Was only there for a night, with a very early check-out (4 A.M.). Breakfast was delivered in the night to my room, which was a great help. Rooms are spacious and nice, staff very helpful, and the round-the-clock hotel shuttle to the airport terminals is just perfect.",5,2016,03,16
245,"Conveniently located, but no early breakfast","Nice hotel, convenient located near the airport. Unfortunately no breakfast option for red-eye flights. First breakfast option is at 7. A possibillity for 1/2 hour  earlier in the room will be charged additionally. Nicely fitted rooms, very silent. Great restaurant. Free shuttle bus to and from the airport avalable",3,2016,03,16
245,Pleasure,Excellent. Meal on the night we arrived was good @ service too was good. Front desk staff quite resourceful when it came to queries in relation to visiting Dublin for a particular task! Room was spacious & not too stuffy. Morning call welcome & room service delivered without cutlery. (Only negativity),5,2016,03,15
245,Great hotel,"Booked through Raddisson own website and got free deserts for all occupy rants of the room. Free on the go breakfast. Tea coffee water fruit and breakfast bar.  Bar food is lovely, restaurant staff very friendly and helpful. Shuttle service to airport very prompt. Would stay in hotel anytime I was flying from Dublin airport.",4,2016,03,15
245,Business meeting room experience,"I attended a training session in March 2016 and was in a meeting room 9am - 5pm for 4 days. The meeting room was spacious, clean with great air con (which can be hard to find sometimes). The service itself was brilliant with the hotel staff always on time each day brining in fresh drinks and were very friendly.",5,2016,03,15
245,"Great Customer Service, location...",Had a great overnight stay and even as i managed to drop.phone down lift shaft they managed to get it out for me! Room great bathrobes and slippers too. Awesome service and happy camper.. Transfer from airport handy too.. Thank you! ,5,2016,03,15
245,Very friendly staff,Convenient location and staff was very welcoming and willing to help. Rooms are clean and convenient. Meeting facilities very convenient at the airport. Windows could be renewed in order to minimise noise from strong winds,5,2016,03,15
245,under repair,Stayed on Saturday night last.  Corridor had been masked ready for painting.  There was some apparatus in the room which appeared to be fastened to the wall - only it wasn't.  Food in restaurant and service in bar very good.,3,2016,03,15
245,Ideal location for a tired traveler,"Unfortunately the hotel was showing its age a bit, and under reservation when I was there, so stinking of oil paint which is not too healthy. Apart from that, the staff were great, the room was clean and well stocked. As I came in late at night, it was very difficult to get parking.",3,2016,03,15
245,meaning of a frequent travler,We came in late and at the airport did not  see any sign of a hotel bus so we took a cab.  It has been 0940 hours and we could still have dinner. Personnel at the bar have been over-strained. Rooms see below. breakfast ok. checkout very friendly and bell boy exelent.,3,2016,03,15
245,Overnight Stay,Passing thru Dublin and stayed one night at the Radisson.  Reception staff really helpful and friendly. Food in the restaurant/bar more pub food than hotel dining. Being so close to the airport you expect to hear ambient air traffic noise.  I have stayed in hotels which are better insulated from noise and that was the only downside.,4,2016,03,15
245,People make the difference,"Excellent service from Reservations directly through hotel from Sarah -- was fantastic with numerous reservations. 
Also upon arrival Ruda in reception was very helpful.
Suggest Nespresso Roma ( grey ) and Ristretto in business rooms. 
Shuttle service to terminal makes all the difference. 
Wish pick up at terminal was easier. 

",4,2016,03,15
245,Disappointing by Radisson Blu standards,Disappointed to have been on a floor where refurbishment was taking place. Strong smell of paint and rooms were not up to the usual Radisson Blu standard. Breakfast still really good with good variety.,3,2016,03,15
245,Thank you!,The Radisson Blu Dublin Airport is super convenient to the airport and the staff and facility is wonderful.  They really go above and beyond to provide quality service and comfort.  I'd highly recommend the hotel.   ,5,2016,03,15
245,Ridulous,"A wooden pallet with s foam mattress what was in the grubby conference room to sleep on.
The cold shower in the morning made me thank god that I was only there for one night. I actually took a photo of the bed, if you could call it a bed. I pulled the mattress onto the floor and slept there.",2,2016,03,15
245,Perfect Location,"We needed a hotel near the airport because of an early flight in the morning.  Beautiful room, wonderful breakfast and great shuttle to the terminal.  Everyone of the employees we encountered were friendly and went out of their way for us.  
",5,2016,03,15
245,"Over rated, over charged.","I would not stay at this hotel again.  First room I was given smelled like an ashtray.  The second room, although on the same business floor, and at the same price, had none of the same amenities as the first (no Nespresso maker, no bottled water, no room safe).  The bathroom was worn and small, the bed very uncomfortable.  It was a miserable to say the least.  The only positive comment I'd make is that the staff was friendly.",2,2016,03,15
245,Excellent hotel for a stop over,"I have stayed here a number of times and it is consistently good. First of all there is a large car park free to residents for short stay, the hotel is very good quality and the bar is brilliant. You can unwind with a drink and meal, the bar staff and waiting staff are really welcoming and friendly - always good service. 

The rooms have been refurbished and are of a high standard, the cost is very reasonable. No noise issues, very comfy beds.",5,2016,03,15
245,"FEB 2016 Stay at Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport","I found the hotel staff very helpful, the restaurant first class, and the convenience of using the shuttle bus to the airport a plus.  I will definitely reserve a room at Radisson Blu when I travel to Dublin in the future.",4,2016,03,15
245,Radisson Blu Dublin,"Excellent facilities and convenient site for airport.
Free shuttle or possible to walk if weather premitting
Staff very helpful with queries.
Room comfortable with standard range of facilities.
Complimentary wifi as well",5,2016,03,15
245,Great location for the Airport,"The only reason we would use this hotel is for airport convenience.accommodation rates vary so much "" between €88 and €180 "" which we can't understand as this hotel is never flu as far as we know.
Last time we stayed here there was no air condition or heating and when we complained the reception staff pretended they were suprised when in fact they all knew the whole floor we had a room in was in the process of having a new system installed, we learned this from a member of staff next morning. After complaining twice the night we arrived they supplied a plug in heater.",2,2016,03,15
245,OK for overnight,The property is dated though business class rooms look like they have been recently renovated.  Breakfast started at 6:30 pm which was when I had to leave the airport.  Would have been nice if breakfast opened at 6 am. Overall a good choice for an overnight stay especially if connecting early at Dublin airport.,4,2016,03,15
245,evaluation of staying at Radisson Blu Hotel Dublin Airport,"it is an excellent option for those who need to take flights from Dublin airport, specially for flights very early in the morning, which was my case. It is very close to the airport and very convenient in that regard. The transfer service is excellent and vey easy to take. The facilities of the hotel are quite good and comfortable and the staff very kind. The hotel provide a nice food and drink service before breakfast period for those who must depart before the breakfast service starts.",4,2016,03,15
245,Very Convenience and close to the Airport,"I've stayed in this hotel now twice, its very comfortable, very handy for parking the car and getting their shuttle bus over to the airport which is only a few minutes away. Would use this again if i'm going to Dublin Airport",4,2016,03,15
245,1st class,"This was our last night in Ireland and wanted to be close to the air and spend our last night in style. The room was A! and the service was 1st class, the restaurant provided us with lovely meals. Highly recommended.  ",5,2016,03,15
245,John,"Enjoyable stay, although you could do with charging less.....It was a nice hotel, close to the airport with a  good shuttle bus. The staff are really friendly and the food in the restaurant was good too. The location is ideal.",4,2016,03,14
245,Ideal hotel nearby Dublin Airport,"For years now we come frequently to Radisson Blu Hotel Dublin Airport. Staff at Reception, rooms, the bar, they're all like family to us, especially Rosaleen. The menu gives a broad choice in the bar, the pick up service from and to the Airport is excellent, who needs more?",4,2016,03,14
245,"Good hotel, poor internet access","Good hotel but no room service, must come down to the bar to get your food.  Also the internet needs to be logged on, so this represents difficulties for equipment like Playstation 4 or other company firewalls.  This can be resolved by direct free WIFI access.  The speed was very slow for download and upload was not efficient.",4,2016,03,14
245,Definetely a good stay at Dublin airport!,"very good location if you arrive late o leave early from the Dublin Int'l airport.
large and comfortable rooms.
good restaurant and bar, nice atmosphere, helpful waiters.
early coffee available in the hotel lobby. good wifi in the hotel.
",4,2016,03,14
245,radisson blu,"the hotel is at the airport and while it was quite expensive, was excellent and very convenient. The cleanliness was excellent, breakfast was really nice and all the staff were very helpful.  All in all a very good if short stay and would definitely do it again.",5,2016,03,13
245,Quiet for an Airport hotal,"Staff really friendly and helpful, beds really comfortable and overall appearance of the hotel is good. Would definitely stay again out of choice rather than just because needed to be there on business.",5,2016,03,10
245,Airport hotel that “does what it says on the tin”,"Walking distance to airport but also a very regular mini-bus shuttle, good range of food available 24 hours a day, free wifi, very modern clean (but sterile) lobby and big spotlessly, clean room with air con, decent showers (wall mounted and hand-held option) and good corner desk. Bed was big and comfortable and excellent selection of TV channels on a decent size Smart TV. There is Express Checkout where you can just drop your key-card into a box – possibly explains why there was no stock in the mini-bar (see below). Basically, it had all you want from a short stay at an airport hotel.

It was let down on a few easily rectifiable aspects - lighting at the desk was abysmal (this would not be a problem in daylight as the desk was beside the window), the bathroom toiletries were very limited and cheap looking (again not a huge problem as most people who care about these things pack their own), the mini-bar was not stocked at all (this may be because of the Express Check Out but it would have been nice to have some complementary water in the room if this is the case) and the shower completely malfunctioned. This I hope was just bad luck and not a chronic problem but the water completely stopped – and suddenly restarted just after I had dried off. The  windows could be better insulated as well as the traffic noise was very audible in the morning. 

Overall though, for convenience to the airport the Radisson Blu scores higly for a fairly reasonable price and I was surprised to see it ranked third out of three, possibly because it is the dearest of the airport hotels – a good reason for better toiletries and complementary water ☺.",4,2016,03,09
245,The poorest Radisson I've ever stayed in,Radisson are normally pretty reliable and good. The one at Dublin airport is very tired. A bare and cold room. Apparently a business room but not clear what I got for that. A bathrobe possibly? Bathroom had stained and peeling sealant on the bath and the shower didn't work at all well or get hot. Expected better,2,2016,03,09
245,"Great Value, Good Location","Excellent value hotel with great location. Rooms spacious and clean. Excellent quality breakfast, both quality and range of choice. Rooms peaceful. Courtesy bus to airport terminals regular and short distance.",5,2016,03,07
245,Good access from airport!,"Well it's an airport hotel and is exactly what it is!  I say this unlike the many that you couldn't possibly walk to, especially at night in the early hours.  This, like the rest has a shuttle bus but you can walk to and from the airport in 10 minutes.  It's not expensive but has all you need for an overnight stay before a flight.  You can opt for a well stocked mini bar, obviously more expensive than the bar or purchase at the bar and take them up.  Bathing facilities are excellent, beds are comfortable and the rooms are nipping clean.  Good access to the lifts and are all secured with room key access.  Breakfast is good and was in my room rate so I can't comment on price. All seemed fresh.  Good meeting facilities and roomy reception makes it ideal for small meetings between flights or a place to have a drink.  I would stay again.  It also has an added benefit of a pub which isn't connected Around the corner.  

For an airport hotel it's one of the best, i wouldn't expect to go there for a holiday. ",4,2016,03,06
245,Good for an airport hotel,"It's convenient to the airport and makes getting to the airport very easy. Shuttles run every 15 minutes. Rooms are nice, modern and American sized beds ( kings are available). Coffee machines are Kurige type. They will give you passes to the leisure center & bus you there ( would have loved to do this but with snow & sleet out.....it's hard to think of going out in it). Restaurant was good, but not attentive to their customers!",4,2016,03,04
245,rest for weary souls,"After a long flight or in preparation for one, consider the supreme comfert and impeccable service of the radisson Hotel at dublin Airport. We have stayed there a number of times and have alwas been totally happy with the experience-room comfort, assistance by all staff and excellent food-what more could anyone ask for. a bus to the airport treminal makes it all effortless particularly with the help with baggage provided.",5,2016,03,02
245,Basic airport hotel,I have stayed here on numerous occasions prior to early flights. The hotel is a basic Radisson Blu but perfectly adequate for one night. I have not used the bar or restaurant so can't comment on these. Shuttle to and from the airport is efficient,3,2016,03,01
245,"Great situation, comfortable and clean","I don't understand why so many people complain about the hotel not being modern. The building from the outside might not be very modern, but the inside of the hotel was lovely. The lifts are new and modern, the corridors to the rooms were clean, and bright. The room was comfortable, warm, and clean. In the room they provide a hairdryer, iron and ironing board, and a kettle to make tea. It was always very quiet. Not once did we hear a plane or other people walking down the corridor. We were on the 5th floor. You control the temperature in the room yourself so you can have it as hot or cold as you like. They also have a free shuttle mini bus that goes to the airport terminals every 15 minutes. There are so many buses that go from the airport to the city center and get you there within 30 - 45 minutes so the location is great if you have an early return flight. There is a McDonalds open 24 hours just around the corner from the hotel, literally a 3 minute walk. The staff on reception at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2016,03,01
245,No Irish Luck Here,"Unfortunate choice for a flight the next morning. Hotel is dated. Hallways dark and dingy. Some room furnishings reminiscent of a hostel. Chairs and table look like they came from a convention center. No heat in room 1. No hot water in room 2. Honestly, how could a hotel consider a room with no heat or hot water saleable. One and done.",1,2016,02,26
245,Never again ,"1 night stay only 
They informed us of a technical problem at night - electricity cut from midnight to 03:00: ok
But 
Room was cold without heating as standard even at 10:00pm, 2 hours before 
Cold water for the shower at 08:00, 5 hours after 
It was a disaster 

Breakfast is acceptable ",2,2016,02,25
245,Useful location but not a great hotel,"The hotel unfortunately seems to depend on its location and name to attract custom and definitely does not offer value for money. The service was okay, but we were given incorrect information at check-in and it took a lot longer than you would expect. The newly trained member of staff didn't seem to have the support she needed to answer any questions etc. The rooms are in desperate need of decoration and repair and we were glad that we only had a short stay there and were flying back out the following morning. Would only book again if I had a very early flight as other, nicer hotels offer shuttle services and are much cheaper.",3,2016,02,24
245,Good Place to stay,"It is right near the Airport, with an excellent shuttle to departures.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a place to stay before a flight. Rooms were clean and staff were very friendly. It is reasonably priced.",4,2016,02,24
245,Radisson Blu - Dublin Airport,"The location is excellent - right by terminal 2 at Dublin Airport.  While the hotel is nice, I don't think we got a great value for the money as the room was cold and the food at the bar was served lukewarm.",4,2016,02,23
245,Not a good experience,"Stayed here for one night prior to an early morning flight.  Payed for an upgrade to a junior suite that looked nothing like the ""floor to ceiling window"" picture on the website.  Felt totally cheated. Air-conditioning not working and could not sleep with windows open as very noisy outside.  No help given with luggage.  Little flies flew around restaurant. Fittings appeared to be falling off the walls.  A very basic three star at most. Nothing like the standard of airport hotels in London.",2,2016,02,22
245,Great after a delayed late flight,"Had a late flight back from Krackow that got delayed one and half hours, so was delighted we had booked the nearby Radisson hotel with car parking. We were picked up by courtesy bus and delivered promptly to the hotel, only minutes away. A very nice man at reception recognised our weariness and upgraded us to a suite and made sure we got comfortable with food and drink as the bar had long closed. 
""
A first class service in the middle of the night""",5,2016,02,22
245,Great base for an early flight,"We didn't spend long at this hotel as we checked in late and left for an early flight, but what we did experience was great. Quick and friendly check in, with a complementary upgrade to a business class room. The room was clean and large with a huge comfy bed, seating area, and extras such as dressing gown/slippers (although only for one person - there were two of us. Given than this was a free upgrade, we didn't mind).

We used the efficient hotel shuttle service in the morning as it was raining, although we walked to the hotel from terminal 2 the night before and it only took a couple of minutes.

We would definitely stay here again if we needed a hotel near Dublin airport.",5,2016,02,21
245,Excellent Visit,"Despite being an Airport hotel with a constant short term turnover of visitors the Radisson brand of excellence shines through.
An excellent helpful front desk staff team and lovely rooms.
The only pity is that the bar food doesn't measure up to the same standards.
Having dined on a number of occasions I feel it lacks any sense of special care or pride in the meals served .",5,2016,02,18
245,Business trip,"always stay at this hotel ever since i join this irish company, its been almost 5 years and there's not whole a lot of improvement nor worsen, only complaint i really have is the toilet takes a few flush to get it going. over all  the convenient and the price is really good for the hotel.",3,2016,02,18
245,Great room & shuttle service,We stayed for one night before our early morning flight and we had a lovely night at the hotel. The room was great value for money. The staff were so helpful and it was great to have the grab and go breakfast in the morning before getting the shuttle to the airport.,5,2016,02,16
245,Stay for a specific purpose only,"Pros: Close to the airport (4-5 mins), there is a shuttle every 15 mins for free to pick you up from terminals 1 & 2. 
good internet, and they have a nice menu at the restaurant . Good breakfast. very good welcome desk

Cons: Hotel is old with small rooms. they are doing renovations though.
Hotel is 25 mins bus ride to downtown dublin. if you are in town to visit the city then it is better to be in Dt area.   
there is nothing around the hotel. 
Best way to go Dt. is to retake the shuttle to the airport and buy a day pass on the 747 bus that runs every 15 min from the airport direct to DT. they are all over the place. price is 10 euro for return tickets 
Hotel does not have a fitness center on premises",3,2016,02,15
245,Good location and food,Simply a good hotel based very close to the airport with friendly staff. The restaurant is open till 22:30 and whilst the food is expensive it's good and there is a reasonable variety. Rooms are basic but are clean and a good size to work and sleep in. ,4,2016,02,15
245,Close to airport ,"Stayed in this hotel for a weekend only because hotels in the centre were highly priced due to rugby being on. Fair hotel, easy access to airport and buses into Dublin. Clean and tidy but could use a touch up in the bathrooms (rust on metal items on wall handles and toilet etc). Pleasant and friendly staff and rooms clean and tidy. Woke up from a terrible noise coming from the air con/heating system - unsure if this was due to it being left on over night.  Wouldn't have an issue staying here again. ",3,2016,02,15
245,Great flight transition hotel,"If traveling through Dublin and your layover is long (ours was 14 hours), this is a great hotel to get some rest and some decent food. The shuttle service is available on demand and the proximity to the airport is within minutes.",5,2016,02,15
245,Worst hotel at Dublin airport,"I was transferring business trips between the US and Europe and booked this hotel as a stop over so I could spend the night with the family before flying out early next morning, booked a junior suite, not worth the money - very run down and in dire need if refurbishment. The service in the bar/restaurant is non existent and even charged for milk for a babies bottle. I had settled the bill on departure as I left early so my wife did not have to and made it abundantly clear that the bill was settled and there was nothing else to pay yet on check out they chanced their arm and stated that I had said just to charge all extras to my card, but when challenged they dropped these charges ??There are far better hotels in the area ( I know as I have stayed)  that are better value for money with top class service. Advice - steer clear.",1,2016,02,14
245,Not bad,"Very convenient place to stay. close to the airport .  Friendly staff.  Looks a bit tired especially in the corridor. Lovely breakfast, atypical of buffet type breakfast most hotels offer. If you want a place to stay close to the airport then this is not bad",3,2016,02,09
245,"Good, but shuttle needs improvement","As always, the room in the Radisson was large and well equipped. The bed was comfortable with a lovely thick duvet. The food in the T3 restaurant was as good as ever.
However we arrived off the Belfast to Dublin airport shuttle bus on a cold, wet, windy day and stood waiting for the complementary shuttle to the hotel. When it hadn't appeared the shuttle bus for the neighbouring Maldron hotel offered us a lift. The following morning at 6,40am there were 12 people waiting to be taken to the airport terminal - the bus can't hold that many. There were 2 buses waiting for drivers to take people. Eventually a driver appeared and some of us got away. At that time of the morning with the demand for transport, both buses should have been in use.
We'll still use the Radisson, but maybe get up even earlier to ensure we get to the airport on time.",4,2016,02,09
245,Great stay,Found the hotel staff very friendly Ruta ( spelt incorrectly i am sure )   receptionist  was professional  and friendly . I found all the staff to be  polite . Room was clean and tidy . House keeping staff were prompt in  request that coffee  machine was not working  and sorted it straight away ,5,2016,02,09
245,Good,"Room was spacious and clean
Check in staff were lovely
Room service was swift and tasted great
Only issue was lack of vending machine which was a pain
Really Good value for money
Would stay again when traveling",4,2016,02,08
245,On Airport,"Great for overnight stop when on early flight. Restaurant and bar werenrather expensive. Other than that, no problems or complaints. Tip... There is a pub close by (can't remember the name) which had much cheaper drinks and very good food.",4,2016,02,08
245,Needs a fresh start.   Tired,I have stayed in this hotel many times while using the airport. To park and fly. My last 2 stays were disappointing. The  furniture is beyond replacement date scuffed and tired. Bed was collappsing and broken at one corner. Towel was unwashed and disgusting on last visit. Run by foreign workers it seems abandoned and unmanaged,1,2016,02,07
245,Room For Significant improvement in Some Areas,"On the whole a comfortable hotel which is very conveniently situated right beside Dublin Airport. In general the staff were friendly but appeared to be somewhat overworked. A negative point is the times the bars open, not very convenient for international travellers. The most annoying issue is the lack of communication between the staff who take bookings and the company that operate the car park. At the time of booking I paid for a weeks parking at the hotel, this was not communicated to the company that runs the car park and on my return to collect my car it took over an hour to establish that I had indeed paid and I was unable to leave the hotel car park until very much later than planned.",2,2016,02,06
245,Perfect for an overnight before an early morning flight,"I stayed here with my partner and our 4 year-old son. The room was warm with two very comfortable beds (one double, one single). The bar/restaurant served a good range of food and all the staff we encountered were friendly and polite.",4,2016,02,04
245,A good hotel close to Dublin airport,"The place of the hotel is excellent: close to the airport , close to the city center ( 30 minutes). The restaurant and the breakfast were good. 
There was no hot water in the bathroom. That's really disappointing early in the morning! My colleague had the same problem and it was not considered seriously by the personnel of the hotel.",3,2016,02,03
245,A place to stay,"Excellent customer service. Get double room, loved the fridge  in the room. Food was very tasty can of course  the Guinness  was out of this world. 
So close to the airport and not far into town,  that's why it is a great grest place to stay.",5,2016,02,03
245,Will stay again,"Good comfy hotel right at the airport! Very spacious room and comfy bed. ""Breakfast on the go"" with a little more options would have be much better. Transport ""round the clock"" from hotel to airport. Checkin and out service were fast. Staff were very pleasant.",4,2016,02,02
245,Interesting stay,"Awesome employees very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was really nice and abundant. The Bar area was kind of lacking but still nice, overall i liked the location and price and would come back again.",4,2016,02,02
245,Our stay at Radisson Blu Hotel,"Excellent value for money. Room service breakfast was exceptional, it was more than complete. The food in the restaurant was top-notch as well. Highly recommend this hotel. Located just three minutes from the airport. ",5,2016,02,02
245,Airport stay,"Lovelyl hotel, fantastic room. Bed great sheets pristine white. Everything you need in bathroom, lovely towels.
Staff at reception very professional.
Waiters very cheerful and also professional, good food.",5,2016,02,02
245,Decent airport hotel,"The staff were friendly. My wife and I had an early morning flight and so spent a good portion of the evening in the hotel restaurant which was very enjoyable; comfortable atmosphere. The bathroom situation, in our room, was not great. The shower setup was extremely awkward. Bathtub shower with a very short piece stretching only two fifths the length of the bathtub. Water everywhere.",3,2016,02,02
245,Good airport hotel,"Very good airport hotel, when you have to catch the plane the following day. Terminal 2 is in walking distance. 
The rooms are tired though and could do with some renovation. The shower glass was not fixed, so that the bathroom was flooded. ",3,2016,02,02
245,Consistently Outstanding,Stayed at this Hotel on numerous occasions. From the reception staff to the restaurant and bar team the service is of the highest standard. With recent upgrades to the rooms and lounge areas the whole experience is positive. I stay in hotels 150 days a year and this hotel consistently exceeds expectations. ,5,2016,02,02
245,Hotel without hot water!,"Extremely disappointed, the hotel experienced boiler problems and left all the guests without hot water service as a wake up surprise Saturday morning.   Although the front desk did deduct 20% off my room charge for the inconvenience - I am sure my company will be happy since it is less they have to reimburse on my expenses - that is not anything that compensates me, personally, for the lack of service or the inconvenience.   It did not make up for not being able to shower prior boarding my 8 hour Transatlantic flight the next morning, (as some of my neighboring seated plane passengers would likely agree!)

(Can someone also explain why Irish hotels do not provide face cloths/wash cloths in the bathroom?  This one hotel included, but not just this hotel.)

The hotel also seemed incapable of processing charges for my meal on Friday night, even though they had taken my credit card information at check-in.    I charged my meal to my room and then received a call from the T3 restaurant, after I had returned to my room, that they were unable to process the meal charge to my room and could I come down to the restaurant and take care of it with them there or could I contact the front desk and ask them to resolve it.   So apparently I was not only a paying guest in the hotel, but I was also supposed to work for the hotel to coordinate between them and their restaurant!   The front desk eventually resolved their mistake and called me back to advise me.",1,2016,02,02
245,JUST PERFECT," i stayed one night by chance in this hotel, cos my flight to France has been delayed;
 I was a VIP  for one night
  was a great suite, huge very clean, all the equipments - even more- ,needed!
 The Room service at about 11 30 PM was just perfect
 i will come back.",5,2016,02,02
245,Not in hot water,"the staff were great, but the hot water failed us and we had to leave very early on a cold day with a cold shower - which did dampen our spirits.  We were told that someone would contact us, but nothing has happened since, which makes me feel that you have broken your promise, which was a shame because up to that point we had a very positive experience.",3,2016,02,02
245,great stay,very good hotel extremely friendly staff and right at the airport. Food and drink well priced considering position and a good buffet breakfast. Access to a gym and pool. Very good indeed. I have stayed many times and will continue to do so,5,2016,02,02
245,Great Service,"The hotel is clean, easy to get to and convenient with a nice pub/restaurant. The beds are more typically European so as an American, it was a bit hard for my taste. The staff was extremely responsive and helpful!",4,2016,02,02
245,Over-priced and disappointing!,"Overpriced, dated hotel that attracts guests simply because it's close to the airport. Think 1970's college dorm room and that's about what you get! The was NO HEATING in the hotel and no compensation for the chill!",1,2016,02,02
245,Quick Stay,I stayed at this Hotel because I had a morning flight and it was right next to the airport.  They had good food for dinner and breakfast. Nice rooms and a shuttle service to the airport that only took 2-3 minutes.,4,2016,02,02
245,Disappointing end to our holiday.,"We had booked one night for six of us for when we returned from a month in Australia. Even though early check in had been agreed and guaranteed by email, the rooms weren't ready and the staff didn't handle it professionally.",2,2016,02,02
245,Convenient and welcoming,"We only stayed one night. Our room was clean and well presented, quite spacious and great in room facilities. The staff were very helpful and the early ""eat and go"" breakfast and shuttle made catching such an early flight stress free",4,2016,02,02
245,Food and service let down,Checked in quite late and went down to eat before resturant closed tried to put me and my family on a table tucked behind a wall when there was basically an empty resturant. Then when mains came several stuff didn't arrive until maybe 10/15mins after the first dish was put down. Bread of the burger rock hard and sweet potatoes wedges completely burnt. Would like to add small portions. Overall a let down for me and my family ,2,2016,02,02
245,No hot water and nothing offered in lieu,No hot water available and nothing offered in lieu for this huge inconvenience when travelling with family. One doubts the commitment of this establishments customer focus as they did t even have the courtesy to offer a free drink or car park discount for such a mess. ,1,2016,02,02
245,Convenient for Airport but an outdated hotel,"very convenient for airport,  food was lovely but overall the hotel was dull and we had ice cold showers the following morning.  staff friendly and offfered something but could not think what to offer.  123",3,2016,02,02
245,Rooms tired & shabby,"Staff friendly, breakfast and breakfast dining area fine, but hallways and room very tired and shabby, badly in need of renovation. It is also redicilous that in order to submit this review you have to write a minimum of 200 characters....that ought to do it !",2,2016,02,02
245,A nice welcome,"A very warm and good welcome. 
The hotel's design is a little dated  and the airconditioning was not working in my room.

I appreciate a lot the package of 50€ for donner and breakfast. Main courses goods and the waiters nice and attentive",3,2016,02,02
245,Awful,"Hot water didn't work.  TV didn't work.  Room was too cold or too hot -- no regulation of temp.  Just awful.  Stay somewhere else.  I didn't find the staff to be too bad, but they did not solve any of the above problems. ",1,2016,02,02
245,"Radisson Blu Hotel, dirty room, heating problem, will not return","Stayed here for a layover in early December. Room was dirty, particularly the bathroom and the a/c and heating did not work properly. I had to open the window to get the room cool enough to be comfortable, and since next to the airport, was a very loud night trying to sleep. Breakfast was also pretty much no very pleasant, so headed to the airport for food. ",2,2016,02,02
245,"Nice Clean Tidy room, with basic finishings and service","Junior suite was much bigger than average with a nice big window and a sofa (although not amazing quality, with no comfy cushions or anything). The bathroom was very small in comparison to the room! We felt very let down by the staff who failed to leave pre-purchased Champagne and Chocolates our friend arranged for us, as we were on our honeymoon: a note from our friend was in the room Congratulating us saying ""here's some bubbly""... with no bubbly to be seen. We queried this with staff twice. Once it was brought to our room it was lovely... but then upon check-out, the staff then tried to charge us for the bubbly, which had already been pre-paid, and they took a copy of the Note left in the room as proof that it was a gift... Very poorly organised.
In summary: nice clean modern hotel, but nothing special and a normal room would be spot on.",3,2016,02,02
245,Enforced Stop Over due to High Winds & Flight being rescheduled,"The staff were very understanding of our plight and processed us into a room very efficiently. The service and food was good and we were well enough looked after. Sometimes when a third party is paying the bill, Aer Lingus in this case and may I say thank you, your treatment and service can be a bit off hand but in this case we were treated very well, Thank you to all .",4,2016,02,02
245,Enjoyable stay,"We usually stay at Radison Blu Dublin Airport for a few nights after arriving from out long haul flights.
The Hotel is conveniently located near Dublin Airport, with a 24 hour shuttle bus service to Terminal 1 & 2. Staff are friendly, rooms clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good but we weren't too keen on the bar food. ",4,2016,02,01
245,"I have worked for the branch so when I book Radisson ,I always know what to expect and I love it !!!","This hotel is the best choice for me every time I flight from Dublin as I want to relax the night before the flight.it provides you free transfer to the airport and back 24 hours ,the rooms are very comfortable and quiet and the staff is great",5,2016,02,01
245,Luxurious unexpected layover,"We stayed here after our ongoing flight was cancelled due to high winds. The bed was  very comfortable, we passed out immediately after our transatlantic flight. The staff were friendly and the food was great. Nice bar atmosphere at night with the football games showing.  Oh yes, and it is super close to the airport, you could walk if the weather wasn't so windy. At the airport you can take a bus into Dublin so it is very convenient. There is a free shuttle to the airport. I believe there is a gym/ spa but we did not use it. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,02,01
245,"Excellent breakfast, dated decor","Room was comfortable and clean, only issue is decor was dated but that is the only small minus. Slept well despite storm blowing outside. Excellent and huge variety of food at  breakfast, all delicious. Good service throughout, staff very helpful and pleasant. ",4,2016,02,01
245,Extra chicken offered for a vegetarian alternative,"In the bar the service was beyond diabolical.elderly waitress was not up to the job,order was wrong multiple times,at one point I has to go to the pass to personal tell the chef my real order!asked for coke and after 3 attempts was told there was none so reluctantly ordered something else to drink and a few moments later a trolley full of drinks appeared that. Included dozens of bottles of coke we would have waited if we knew someone would be bringing some down. When trying to organise a vegetarian meal salad was the only option offered and i mentioned we had hot food in mind and she then suggested having extra chicken in the vegetarian meal. ",1,2016,02,01
245,"Clean, comfortable, good restaurant","Stayed there on night but found the room very clean and comfortable. The restaurant is also ok - simple food, nothing spectacular. 
Overall, it is a very good solution if you have an early morning flight due to its position.",5,2016,02,01
245,New York stop over!,"Nice hotel and we were given a warm welcome from reception. The rooms were clean and spacious! The bed was comfy. The bar, however, was unbearably hot and the drinks options weren't brilliant! We jumped on the courtesy coach the next morning which was very convenient! All in all a great one nighter! Recommended!!",4,2016,02,01
245,"Convenient, clean and professional - recommend","Weather forced an over night in Dublin. This hotel was in the airport area. The driver of the mini bus went out of his way to keep me feeling safe - thanks Eugene. 

I even managed a decent room rate which I learned later bookers didn't. 

They even provided toiletries as I was not expecting this stop. Thanks.

Would stay again. ",5,2016,02,01
245,Lacking,"I was disappointed with my stay at the Radisson, or feel it failed to live up to the reputation of the brand. While clean and otherwise fairly comfortable, my bathtub did not have a working stopper and could not be used to take a bath (only a shower), the way the lights were wired and set up they could only be turned on and off from the switch by the door (meaning I had to get up out of bed to turn them off and stumble in the dark back to bed, and vice versus) and despite having a confirmed business class reservations I did not have a complimentary robe or mineral water as promised. ",2,2016,02,01
245,An embarrassment to all hotels. ,"Stayed here for the first leg of our trip with the kids which was memorable for all the wrong reasons...... As soon as you walked in to reception you was greeted with a dirty smoky chip fat smelling reception..... Got our keycard to our room which was dated to say the least!! Rusty taps in bathroom & bodged jobs all over which were rather comical. Opened the window to be greeted with months/years of cigarette dimps & the room stunk of dirty old cigarettes..... But it kind of matched the decor of the room, old musty & an embarrassment. Me & my partner went to the bar for a drink and when we came back up our 10 year old son was waving an empty packet of Viagra about (defo not mine) his mother traumatised at this but I found it amusing but on the serious side of it what if a baby found it & put in his her mouth?? Nobody really cared about this when raised in reception so maybe an apology would have been nice. Best thing you can do with this hovel is knock it down and start again. And maybe employ some staff that actually care about the concerns raised. ",1,2016,02,01
245,Not as bad as previous reviews suggested,"I stayed at the Raddison Blu for 1 night when ending the final leg of an Ireland tour. Check in was fine, no issues, as was the room which was large but relatively standard in terms of facilities.
The bar area was ok however a little strange layout, but no issues.
The service was fine and one good feature was that there was tea and coffee available in the foyer at 5am so before you jump on your plane you can grab something to drink - that is a very good idea in my opinion.
There was a courtesy bus to the terminal (although it is in easy walking distance from the terminal the roads are a little busy at all hours).

One thing I will say - there is a 24 hour bus runs into Dublin Centre from the airport terminal every 30 minutes. When next visiting I would be highly tempted to avoid the cost of a city centre hotel and simply stay here & get the bus to-from Dublin centre - I think it was 10 Euro's for a return ticket.

In summary this was a reasonably priced hotel which delivered exactly what it said on the tin.",4,2016,02,01
245,Brilliant business trip,"Great location, easy access into Dublin. Staff who cared about their roles and helping to fix anything required.room chilly due to maintenance but heater provided very quickly to an upgraded room. A great 2 night stay",5,2016,02,01
245,Excellent stay,"Stayed here to catch an early flight the next morning, perfect location and had everything I needed. The shuttle service was extremely convenient as well, although the walk to the airport is short. Definitely recommend this for travelers.",5,2016,02,01
245,Overnight business trip,"Friendly staff who were more than willing to let me email my check-in form for the return flight.  Slight downside was the breakfast, which didn't cater much for vegans...but I'm sure that's not a problem for most people!

Clean room, nice bathroom.",3,2016,02,01
245,Good and yet . . .,"Our room was fine and we always appreciate that the staff remembers that we want to be on the back of the hotel away from the airport.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is simply too loud and there is virtually nowhere to eat dinner with some semblance of quiet.  I realize that during our last overnight at the Radisson Blu is was during the holidays and there was in fact a holiday part.  I'd be fine with that if it wasn't always like that . . . simply too much noise and virtually impossible to simply talk & be heard across the table.
",3,2016,02,01
245,No complaints..,"We only needed a room to change and rest during a brief overnight stay, the Radisson BLU proved a perfect choice..

They have a shuttle service every 15 mins from both Terminals and it's only a few minutes drive to the hotel. You could walk in maybe 5-10 minutes but you would need to know the airport layout..

Very nice welcome at the front desk, we paid on arrival to take advantage of the express checkout and were in our 5th floor room in less that 5 minutes from walking in through the hotel door

Our standard room was bright and clean with a decent sized bathroom  featuring good lighting and a good size bath and shower.

Very comfortable double bed and a good view of the airport made it perfect for us.

We had a very early departure from the hotel, before 5am, so express checkout was very handy, and an array of hot drinks and breakfast bars in reception meant we had as reasonable start to the day as we could have had, given the early hour..

Would definitely stay here again, for the convenience, the comfortable room and the friendly staff who made us feel so welcome.. 
",5,2016,02,01
245,Improved since last review,"Stayed here recently, did the park and fly, good value. Food has improved since my last review of this place, the fish and chips was gorgeous, service was fast and friendly. Very nice room, breakfast was great, to free wifi, the shuttle works well, arrived home late and a quick call as we exited the terminal and the shuttle collected us. Considering this is an airport hotel it offers a lot",5,2016,01,31
245,Poor!,"I stayed on the 26th December 2015

The hotel was having renovations and was generally tired.

My room was freezing cold and had no heating - eventually this was remedied when the house keeper brought me a convector heater.

Great location and free transfer mini bus - but I would avoid this place!",1,2016,01,31
245,Tired looking,"Stayed here to catch an early morning flight   Staff were very pleasant and efficient. Room was clean and comfortable but sadly noisy from the heating system. This was constant all night long. Was too early for breakfast but tea/coffee and water to go was available in the foyer
",3,2016,01,31
245,"Nice hotel, have recommended to others","I have stayed here twice now and it is very nice, really comfy beds and helpful staff. So close to Dublin Airport it's really handy, courtesy minibus every 15 minutes, leave the hotel at 3pm and arrive at the airport at 3.05 it's THAT close! Found no loud noise problem at all, didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that but the food in the Restaurant was excellent.
On the downside at weekends it doesn't seem possible to just get a sandwich or a snack in the restaurant/bar, you would need to order room service for something small.",5,2016,01,31
245,Good Enough for Overnight,The shuttle does not run on a regular basis or at least in the evening from airport. All three of us called and were told the shuttle runs every fifteen minutes but we waited 45 minutes. The hotel is real close to the airport so you would be better of calling a cab. In the morning the shuttle ran on time and is available upon request 24 hours to airport. Reception was professional and nice. I reserved two beds but got one. The room was furnished well. Bed was fairly comfortable. The bathroom was dirty with urine on the wall in front of toliet. The heat did not work in the room but after the issues with room service did not bother to report. Order room service at 10pm called again at 11pm and then cancelled at 11:30pm. They were rude and no apologies for bad service. If you are flying out it is good enough for the night. There are better choices for longer stays. ,3,2016,01,30
245,Pleasant,"overall good, you could change up the music in the lobby a little more often, the staff was very helpful and courteous, everything was clean and tidy, room service was in a timely manner, I would definitely stay here again ",3,2016,01,30
245,Liked it,"The hotel (Radisson Blu Hotel) was very comfy and they even had a shoe cleaner but it wasn't the best I've had. It has a very nice buffet in the hotel it also has people who can bring th breakfast to you in the bed
",4,2016,01,29
245,Very dated and in need of updating,This hotel is adequate if you just need a night to stay before or after a flight but it seems like they don't really care about the service or the appearance of the hotel. It seems like they know they have a captive market so will just continue to price gouge and we are expected to deal with it. The staff were very inefficient and the room we were first given was not what we had booked. The second had a bathroom which was utterly filthy. On-top of that we waited nearly 40 minutes for the shuttle to pick us up despite them telling us they would be straight there. Stay here only if you have to.,2,2016,01,29
245,"Great airport stay, Comfortable, amazing staff","Beds are super comfy -- Nespresso machine in room. absolutely brilliant.

No complaints at all. A fantastic airport stay when transiting via Dublin. Have stayed here before several times. Great breakfast, as well. Super fast, efficient shuttle service to airport terminals. AMAZINGLY friendly staff. Had a great chat with two of the ladies before taking the shuttle. They just seem to pay attention to details here.",4,2016,01,28
245,Great location for business at the aiirport,Stay overnight at the hotel and held meetings the next day. Very convenient for others attending the meeting from overseas. Good food and well priced. Convenient parking for access to the M50. Would recommend to others.,5,2016,01,28
245,Very Expensive one night stay in a tired hotel,"Even booking 2 weeks in advance, it was an expensive €135 for one nights stay. Got AirCoach to Dublin from Cork but had to walk back from Terminal to Radisson Blu (I did not ask nor was I offered any information on shuttle bus). From the get-go the reception is tired looking as are the bedrooms. It just was far to expensive for a one night stay. ",2,2016,01,28
245,Very relaxing,Myself and my husband stayed in the Radisson last weekend.It is a fabulous hotel. The staff everywhere are so helpful and professional at their jobs.The room was a great size an very modern. Lovley comfortable bed.loads of hot water for a shower or bath.fantastic selection for breakfast. Would recommend this hotel.The only disappointing bit was we paid 12euro for parking.I have stayed in lots of hotels in Dublin and this is the first hotel we had to pay parking. Linda,5,2016,01,27
245,Great place to crash after a delayed flight,"24 hr. room service and a McDonalds right around the corner made our late arrival bearable and even relaxing. The breakfast was fantastic. Anything a person could think of was there; and just in case something was missing you could always ask. 

The rooms were a little dated, but clean and up to snuff. The service at the desk was a little difficult to understand and the shuttle bus from Terminal 1 was a little tricky to find, but after calling reception for directions we found it.  

All-in-all, we are very glad that we chose to stay there for a night before continuing our travels. 

PS: despite being told that a person cannot really walk there, there is indeed a sidewalk the entire way, for the independent traveller. ",4,2016,01,27
245,First ever trip to visit Dublin,"Very good situated on walking distance from Dublin airport terminals. Nice ambiance , rooms and the airport facilities near at hand. Nice breakfast and a good evening meal. In case you have much luggage one can you the somewhat somewhere hidden hotelshuttle. Better look at the terminal maps before walking on your own. It is getting used to the left/right non-continental situation. Easy Dublin trips with the 1,2,3 days tourist transport tickets offers . easy done ,easy go",5,2016,01,27
245,Convenient and works,"Convenient and works if taking an early morning flight- all as would expect from the Radisson group- staff very helpful and polite, quick and efficient. .  Had dinner there and good,  very nice  service. Rooms could do with a little updating but all in all a pleasant stay. ",4,2016,01,27
245,The best thing about this hotel is the free shuttle taking you away to the airport,"A functional, miserable experience that would have made a depressing start to any holiday. The room was large. The bathroom was clean. The room had no attractions at all. Curtains and carpets looked as though they were remnants from another place - no coordination. The bed was specially constructed to gash your leg at its sharp, wooden, exposed corners. The matress had springs that you could feel. It was very uncomfortable. The lighting was poor and you couldn't control it from the bed, nor could you read in bed as the bed surround blocked the light. Luckily we had only to survive one night before we flew away.",1,2016,01,27
245,You are what you say and you say what you are.,"No fuss about it Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport is exactly that. It is clean staff is friendly everything is accurate and the hotel very close to the terminal.

I don´t ask for anything more from a airport hotel :)",4,2016,01,27
245,great reception,"I arrived early in the morning after a flight from Newark, NJ, USA, and was given access to my room for an immediate nap. When I realized that my assigned room was near the elevator and requested a room change, the staff made the change without argument. Perfect! The room, bathroom, hotel amenities including bar and restaurant, were quite pleasant. Shuttle driver was helpful, and all staff were accommodating. 
This was an excellent airport hotel and made my arrival and departure from Dublin comfortable and easy.",4,2016,01,26
245,Over night stay,"The staff are lovely it's ok for a overnight stay before you fly and to park your car but a lot of noise at night from other guests staying in the hotel rooms are very clean and tidy, room rates are very high only I got a good deal online ",5,2016,01,26
245,Close to the airport ,"Overpriced for what it is, this hotel has a motel feel. Very close to the airport, with nice bar food which is redeeming but the rooms are very basic , we paid €125 for room only not including parking for one night. This is not a 4 star hotel but a clean 3 star ",3,2016,01,26
245,An Airport Hotel,I have to rate this hotel as very good as I have nothing much to say really. Its an airport hotel; clean and convenient but nothing special. Will be booking here again if I were in transit. Very handy and near from the airport.,4,2016,01,26
245,Very happy with our stay,"We stayed in the Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport as we were taking an early morning flight the next day. We arrived by coach to the airport and were picked up by the courtesy bus and quickly arrived at the hotel. The room we were allocated was spotlessly clean. We ate a very nice evening meal in the hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel bus brought us, without delay, to the airport the following morning. ",5,2016,01,26
245,Comfortable Airport Hotel,Comfortable Airport Hotel with a free shuttle bus which leaves every 15 minutes to  Terminals 1 and 2 up to 12 am and then you have to ring the hotel for a pick up. In the process of being upgraded on certain floors. Very friendly and helpful staff. A comfortable and clean room with sat TV free wifi. The buffet breakfast has plenty of selection with local specialities. Slightly more expensive than some other nearby hotels but it is possible to get a good deal if you book early.,4,2016,01,26
245,Great Location for the Airport!,"We stayed here as 2 adults and 2 children as we had an early morning flight. Room was lovely and spacious, check-in was easy and staff were very pleasant. We had dinner in the bar, again the staff were very helpful and pleasant. Checkout in the morning was very easy which is good as we were anxious to get over to the airport with as little fuss as possible!",5,2016,01,26
245,As usual Radisson does not let me down.,"Great when getting an early flight, room was spacious and clean, can walk to the airport, though there is a free shuttle. easy check in and friendly staff.  the chain is always good and your assured of a good night sleep.",4,2016,01,26
245,Great for airport stay,"A lovely clean, comfortable hotel near the airport, there was a 24 hours shuttle and even coffee and tea and snacks available in the lobby for very early check out at 5 am. Friendly staff and nice size rooms.",5,2016,01,26
245,Overnight Stay,We stayed in this hotel prior to an early flight to the USA.  The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are comfortable.  There is a minibus to take you to the airport but Terminal 2 is also within walking distance.  Food however is expensive in the bar and restaurant.,4,2016,01,26
245,A night before flying ,"We arrived at about 7 pm to the easily access hotel doors, just minutes from the airport. First impression of the front hall was luxury. The staff followed it up bully being extremely attentive to all of our needs. Which included toothpaste as we forgot to buy some. 

After checking in and relaxing for a bit we decided to go have dinner in the bar/restaurant T3. Fairly elegant set up for a hotel bar I would admit. The food was fantastic with top class service. 

The rooms are very spacious Fitted with a quaint little bathroom that holds all of the essentials for a comfortable overnight stay. There was also a fully working digital tv that provided some bedtime entertainment. 

The only reason a star is lost is that the mattress was just a little bit too soft for me. However that's my own personal preference. ",4,2016,01,26
245,My favorite color is Blu,"The hotel was gorgeous.  The staff was warm, friendly and helpful.  The room had a great view . The room had a Nespresso machine.  The food in the restaurant was so tasty and presented well.  The prices in the restaurant were not budget friendly but were well worth it for a treat.  I highly recommend this hotel and restaurant to travellers and locals alike. There was also an airport shuttle every 15 mins 👍👍👍👍",5,2016,01,26
245,Great location poor food,"Great location, nice firm bed helpful staff, pleasant walk from the airport terminal after a flight but shuttle is also runs 24hr.   Very badly let down by their food, desiccated burger on dry bap and stringy steak.   Breakfast fine with a good range of cold and hot foods.",3,2016,01,26
245,Bio-hazard,"The room was dirty and covered in stains. Worst were the small decorative throw pillows had suspicious white crusty stains on them. The carpets in the hallways were ripped and sticking up and dangerous. The room service food was overcooked dry and dreadful. When I  woke up in the morning I had red bites all over my torso. Bedbugs?
I recommend future guests to pack a bio-hazard suit!! Yuck. 4*hotel...... NOT!!!",1,2016,01,25
245,Always suitable,I often stay at the radisson blue in Dublin. I've never had a negative experience and can't imagine having one. Great mix of service and convenience. Thanks for the great experience. I look forward to my next one.,5,2016,01,25
245,Plesant hotel when traveling and need to stay close to the airport,"Stay in the hotel frequently when traveling as it is very close to the terminal.
Friendly and helpfull staff.
Good rooms for a short stay.

When booking on line you cannot always book a room without breakfast.",4,2016,01,25
245,Lunch,"Absolutely great food on offer, friendly staff and lovely decor. Atmosphere and location are fantastic too. we really enjoyed the experience and would recommend the Radison Blu to anyone. There was a carvery on and the value was unbeatable.",5,2016,01,25
245,Great staff - tired hotel in need of investment,"Terrible shower, beat up furniture, limited heat - had to use a portable heater, poor room service food - stale hard bread, no on site workout facilities, charged to use computer to print boarding passes in business center, fantastic staff - efficient and friendly - trying to do their best despite ownership/management lack of investment in the infrastructure - Radisson should be ashamed",2,2016,01,25
245,Moderate hotel conveniently situated,"Have stayed here several times before when catching an early morning flight. Rooms are clean and functional.
I fees standards are slipping. I had to call reception to get a remote control for the TV. There was no suitcase rack so had to place my bag on table to unpack. There was no desk chair, and no air conditioning. Apparently they are re- doing the air conditioning system. There was no telephone beside the bed so if my request for a 5am alarm call had been supplied I would have had to get out of bed to answer the phone on the desk. As it was I got a tap on the door at 5.15. Luckily I had set my own alarm clock for 5.00.
The final annoyance was that my request for my car park exit ticket to be validated wasn't carried out. So when I tried to drive out of the car park the barrier wouldn't raise until I had remarked the car and gone back into the hotel to get reception to give me another ticket to get out.
All this was not good enough for a hotel which charges plenty for its convenient proximity to the airport.",3,2016,01,25
245,Excellent,"We arrived at 10am thinking we would have to drop our bags off and come back later to check in. We were very surprised when they offered us a room straight away. Pleasant room with all what we needed. Breakfast was really excellent with lot's of choice. Would definitely stay again, close to airport with shuttle service provided. Also good links to city centre..",5,2016,01,25
245,Will be excellent all round once refurb completed,"Have stayed here before. This time we were in one of the rooms overlooking the bins, which hadn't been updated, and in which every wall socket was drilled in at a a slanty angle. Bathroom needed a spruce up. Hotel itself is efficient and well set up for speedy airport departures. Juice or milk option at grab and go breakfast buffet (i.e. option for children as well as tea/coffee for adults) an a nut-free cereal bar would be good if you have paid for breakfast but need to depart before it opens. ",4,2016,01,25
245,A brief stay.,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Raddison in January. The room was just what the doctor ordered after spending time exposed to the elements earlier that day. The bed was spacious for two and very comfortable. The shower was outstanding. The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful.",5,2016,01,25
245,great except for the kid's bed,"We have stayed 3 times with you whe  we are flying out next day and sooo much is fantastic (location, service,  breakfast (!)) but the family room is a queen wigh a sofa bed. The queen is very comfy, but our kids only 4 & 6 were so uncomfortable on the old & bumpy sofa bed they had to fall asleep on our bed, then be transferred to the fold out. Not good when we wanted to be well rested for the impending long haul back to Melbourne. (#108)",4,2016,01,25
245,One day review,"Personal was very nice in all moments. Room was very clean and have a very good view. Very quiet rooms. Very good breakfast, may choices and very tasty. I do not see any amenities sign in order to get to there. ",4,2016,01,25
245,Business,"Very nice Hotel.Room well laid out ,chairs very comfortable.Sandwiches very nice and the soup good.It would be nice if they validated your car park ticket but you get charged full price.Staff friendly and very accommodating.",4,2016,01,25
245,Great hotel,Friendly and easy to approach staff. Grab breakfast for early flights available. Just 10 minites walk from terminals. Room was warm and well furnished with TV. Great view from 4th floor. Two lofts available.,5,2016,01,25
245,Dublin Airport Stay,The hotel is very close to the airport and very convenient. The staff were very friendly and the room was clean. The only issue was that the heated towel rail in the bathroom was not working. The temperature for the overhead shower was not easily turned down to cool.,4,2016,01,25
245,Not as nice as the Maldron over the road,"Stayed one night. Ate in the restaurant/bar. It was unexceptional, service slow despite lots of staff milling around. Rooms were clean and large, but Pillows and duvets cheap and too stuffy. Good bus service to terminal",3,2016,01,25
245,Christmas stay,"Staff very courteous and helpful 
The hotel was spotlessly clean.
Room facilities excellent
Shuttle bus driver most helpful and polite
Ideal location for early morning flight
Location easy to access
The only down side was the car park was full and when we finally got a car space it was very narrow",4,2016,01,25
245,Extremely comfortable stay,The room was excellent room and the staff was very helpful. I was given a free upgrade to the Business Class room! The one touch room service offered by Radisson Blue is absolutely amazing! Room service is excellent as well!,5,2016,01,25
245,Very tired hotel,"We were disappointed with this hotel.  Having stayed at many Radisson Blu hotels this one really let the side down. Arrival and check in was made complicated by the receptionist as I wanted three rooms all to be charged to my account. Eventually got sorted. 

On the way to the rooms was when we first noticed how tired the hotel was. There was a huge tear in the carpet in the corridor. It had been half-heartedly taped down but not entirely and was a dangerous trip hazard.

The rooms had no air conditioning as it was being refurbished.  There was no warning of this prior to arrival and no mention at check in. Is was 30th December but the room was really too warm for comfort. 

The beds were soggy and could honestly do with replacing the mattresses as we could feels the springs in places. The rooms themselves are large but the decor is very dated and facilities varied. For example, One had a nespresso coffee machine and another had no facility for making a drink of any kind. 

The shower was powerful and hot - always a bonus and probably the best thing about the hotel. In fact, the best thing about the hotel is seeing the hares that graze at the roadside if you make the effort to walk from the terminal to the hotel. 

The restaurant was ok with friendly staff but be warned that it shows sports on the to so you may want to ask for a table around the corner if you want an intimate or business dinner.

Check out was poor. I was ignored for a few minutes before finally being grunted at by a woman who clearly didn't believe in offering a positive customer experience and it put even more of a dampener on what was already a slightly disappointing start to our holiday. 

A shame really as it has made me think twice about Radisson Blu. We were intending to stay at this hotel again when we travel in March but won't be doing so based on our experience. 
",2,2016,01,25
245,Unexpected new year,"Not value for money. I arrived at 3 15 am January 1st having been delayed on flight from Istanbul. Despite being told I was getting an upgrade the room was just ok, the door with a lived in look and I could hear the people next door. Breakfast was adequate but I had paid too much for occupying the room for a few hours only.",3,2016,01,25
245,Stay at Radisson Blu Dublin airport,"Overall the hotel was a good value with good services.  It is within walking distance to Terminal 2 at the airport and is in a walker friendly area.

Fitness center is located down the street at a big gym, the hotel shuttle will take you there. I like this feature.

Check in and check out was very easy.

The restaurant food was good and the service was very good.",5,2016,01,25
245,"Reasonable, but not great","It is good for a night's sleep before heading to the airport, but not well maintained.  Like other reviewers, we had trouble getting enough heat in the room.  The breakfast and restaurant are very well done.",3,2016,01,25
245,Great and quite Hotel near the airport.,"Very good Hotel with a great service in reception, breakfast and coach for / to the airport.
I'm a Carlson Club member and so they gave me a Business Room (Excellent) and not the Standard Room that I reserved.
I had only a little problem: the maid did not reset and clean my room after the first night. They proposed to change the room for the second night for this reason, but i preferred to stay in my first room.",4,2016,01,25
245,Overnight stay,"Lovely hotel had to stay here overnight due to a delayed Ryanair flight of 8 hours ,Minibus driver very helpful.
Thought room was a bit expensive for one night 105 Euro  and no breakfast. Overall was glad to have stayed here. Thanks.",5,2016,01,25
245,It's the Business,"Great Galway hotel with friendly staff, good facilities. All the pubs and restaurants in the town centre are round the corner, yet it is in its own quiet location. Rooms are very good - especially the ones with a harbour view, and 5th floor rooms are fantastic. Beds in all rooms are exceptional. Raw, the sushi restaurant on the 4th floor is fabulous.",5,2016,01,25
245,unwind in comfort,Lovely spacious hotel with big lobby to unwind. Food was five star and very friendly staff. room was spacious with all mod cons. Really relaxing stay with great access to m50 motorway into dublin city,5,2016,01,25
245,Horrendous,"I don't know what's going on with this hotel but it seems to me that the quality has gone way down over the couple of years. We got a room with NO heating. They knew about the fact that this was the case but hoped we didn't complain...  Also the food at the restaurant was s***t.  not eatable. I ordered clam chouder that looked like porrige and had now taste. And my friend ordered fish with ""spinach"" - which actually was just fish with some potatoe cake (probably frozen, bought from Lidl?) with a trace of spinach. I cannot recommend this place. Try the other airport hotels around. They seem nice. I don't think I will ever come back.",1,2016,01,25
245,"Reasonable rooms, typical airport hotel","Probably the best of the Dublin airport hotels because of its decent rooms. The restaurant is a bit soulless and there are lots of empty seating areas. When we had lunch, the restaurant was really chilly though it had warmed up by dinner time. Shuttle is fine, though also a short walk to terminals if you can cross the road. Free wifi and helpful staff.",3,2016,01,25
245,Overnight stay for early flight,Hotel was perfectly located for an overnight stay before an early morning flight. Room was comfortable and had a fridge and complementary sparkling water. Restaurant/bar area was nice (full menu available even though was a Sunday night just after Christmas) and staff efficient and attentive. Shuttle bus in the morning was good if you have lots of luggage but it really is a short walk to terminal 2.,4,2016,01,25
245,Great experience!,"Held a 5 day L&D event at the hotel which was complex in many ways : 115 delegates attending 10 different classes but all taken care of to a high level of satisfaction. The venue is so well located from the airport but going downtown for a bit of air is only 20 minutes away. Great team, great spirit and very professional meetings & events support!",4,2016,01,25
245,Could do better.,Very handy for airport and bus connections. Somewhat shoddy overall but I suppose adequate. Not very impressed but it did what it said on the tin. I resent having to spend any more time on this review.,3,2016,01,25
245,In the airport,The Radisson is the only hotel in the grounds of Dublin airport. There are other hotels nearby but this area can get very congested and delays can be costly. The hotel has been refurbished and is comfortable. i have stayed a few times and have always slept well. The breakfast buffet is good with a wide variety but I was a bit disappointed at the quality of the bacon and puddings which could be greatly improved. Food service at night is from a fairly limited menu but is of good quality,4,2016,01,25
245,"Cold room, cables on the floor poorly kept bathroom","The bed room was very cold with an electric heater brought to the room as the in room heating only worked every two hours, electricity cable of some sort on the carpet floor very untidy, the bathroom was very poor with rust to be see on several surface, Only 1 bath towel in the bathroom very unpleasant stay ",2,2016,01,25
245,Amazing,"We stayed here due to its convenience to the airport  

But size of bus is very very inconvenient as it is only a small minibus and can not carry many passengers!

But all in all the hotel is in a very convenient location and I would recommend it to families that will be heading off on a plane to stay here the night before!!!
",5,2016,01,25
245,20 Minutes for a Burnt Coffee,"2 conferences where on. We went to restaurant at break and waited 20min on the waiter to bring us over a menu no menu arrived, there was more communication from the chef at the serving hatch than the waiter. we then give up and went to cafe at front and got coffee which we waited 20minutes for, the coffee was boiling and burnt. 
",1,2016,01,25
245,The blu,The food was excellent and so was the service.  I will be staying again if I am leaving from Dublin. It is close enough to the airport you could almost walk to the terminal but radiation provides a shuttle bus,5,2016,01,25
245,David Lloyds,"The rooms were excellent and service provided was to form. My upgrade was performed very well, unfortunately I could only stay one night. Dinner and Breakfast was excellent. The room was clean and well appointed. The coffee machine supplied could do with some clear instructions on how it works",5,2016,01,25
245,"Clean, hospitable and ideal for a pre flight stay",No issues with the service or comfort; it was as close as you needed for an very early morning start. Dinner at the bar was perfectly fine for bar food but no devoid of any real ambience or character.,3,2016,01,25
245,Nera access to Dublin aeroport.,"The position of the hotel is excellent. The only thing that I disliked was the impossibility to have a good breakfast as my flight was scheduled early in the morning. In fact, the hotel offers only a quick take away breakfast.",4,2016,01,25
245,Worst hotel in Dublin,"This is the worst Radisson hotel I have ever stayed in. And I travel quite a bit and would put me Of staying in any other Radisson hotels. The room we got had a damp smell in it like there was water leaking for days, there was no heat in the room the room the and when we stayed it was -2 outside, there was lights hanging off the wall and live wires exposed. All in all the worst hotel I ever stayed in. ",1,2016,01,25
245,Convenient airport hotel,"Very convenient location for departures and air bus drop off.

Food & beverage facilities all good.

Clean and spacious room

Excellent front desk, information and shuttle bus very efficient.

Would recommend.",4,2016,01,25
245,Airport hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel if you are looking for a hotel very close to the airport for an early morning departure. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and everything one would expect from an international hotel chain. 
Perhaps it was my misunderstanding but the ""grab and go continental breakfast"" that was promised turned out to be a small cafe set up in the lobby where two pastries and two coffees cost twice what one would pay at a Starbucks.  For the rate that they charge for a room free fresh brewed coffee would have made our early morning departure a little smoother.
Fast shuttle service to the Dublin Terminals left on the quarter hour, and dropping off a rental car could not have been easier (I highly suggest that you return your car the night before so that you are not pressed with that additional task immediately prior to your flight).
Food in the restaurant was good, stick to what the waitress suggests.
Hotel staff was helpful. ",3,2016,01,25
245,Experience,Breakfast. Was (Cold) but will have to forgive that because the staff were brilliant and very friendly and the room left nothing to be desired. Jim. The hotel is very close to Dublin airport plus there is a brilliant free shuttle bus service between hotel and airport. (Jim) (Wexford),5,2016,01,25
245,Very good value,"January sale so got a great deal 
They kindly served us a breakfast in our room at 545 am 
As our flight was leaving early
Great service
Courtesy bus driver very friendly and helpful with luggage etc 
We will stay here again
",5,2016,01,25
245,Very comfortable hotel,"Very welcoming staff and a very adequate room for the price paid. There was a fault with my phone and when I didn't answer the wake up call a staff member knocked on my door to make sure I was awake. This was a nice touch which I appreciated very much.
The breakfast was excellent with a wide variety of dishes on offer to suit all tastes.",5,2016,01,25
245,Just a bit cool,"I like the hotel very much and find the staff to be great. It is just that I seem to have a heating issue about one out of every three visits. My last stay, neither the thermostat or the back up radiator worked and I was cold.",4,2016,01,25
245,Lovely staff,"Perfect accommodation for early morning flight from DUB. 
Restaurant is very pleasant and accommodating. 
Hotel staff are friendly and gracious. 
Rooms are clean and quiet. 
This is a fine, no-frills hotel. 
",3,2016,01,25
245,Served it's purpose,"The reception staff and restaurant staff were all good.. The room was excessively hot as there was a fault with the air conditioning. Being in the position it was it was far too noisy to open the window-as one would expect.
The next morning all of our party felt very unwell, chesty and hoarse, although we were all in different rooms. Luckily the rest of the party improved throughout the day, but being asthmatic, I became very unwell and had to attend the doctors in New York, where I was diagnosed with an upper respiritory tract infection and needed antibiotics and steroids. I feel certain this was as a result of the problem with the air conditioning.
Apart from that, the room was clean and spacious thank you.",3,2016,01,25
245,Convenient,"Signage from airport for hotel shuttle bus was poor and we had to walk with luggage, asking several people. Location very convenient for the airport. Restaurant poor, with very slow, inattentive service.",3,2016,01,25
245,Average,"It is currently undergoing major AC/HVAC renovations. If you are crashing and need sleep due to time change/abroad travels, you will not due to construction noise during the day. You can get a shuttle from the airport anytime, but will need a 20 euro taxi cab to get to/from downtown. Room adequate, bath shower head took some engineering effort to figure out. Large lobby with a coffee/snack bar, no fitness center. Old carpet but clean room. Hotel staff is friendly and efficient at any hour.",3,2016,01,25
245,superb,Consistently professional with welcoming staff and superior to airport hotels here or other countries. Have recommended hotel hotel for meal and overnight - the best evidence of a satisfied client! Thanks,5,2016,01,25
245,Airport stop over,"Room was perfect, nice and comfortable, we had an early 6am flight so left raddisson at 4am, the shuttle bus was waitin there to bring us and they had tea coffee, breakfast bars, fruit and bottled water there free of charge as it was too early for breakfast! Dropped us right to our terminal! Really enjoyed our stay",5,2016,01,25
245,Would stay again,Lovely hotel. It is very convenient as the airport very close. I was picked up from airport at night and the staff were all very friendly. Very comfortable beds and spacious room. Would stay here again.,5,2016,01,25
245,Airport hotel,"Nice comfortable hotel 
Staff  very helpful
Quick check in and check out
Clean room and comfortable bed
Not too noisy considering adjacent to the airport

Free shuttle to airport friendly helpful driver thank you!",4,2016,01,25
245,Perfect,"Nice and very helpful staff, perfect room with water, tv, kettle, fridge, iron board..., Big variety of food for the breakfast buffet, and good to have a shuttle that can give you lifts to the terminal",5,2016,01,25
245,Bad mannagment of staff,"I ordered 2 bottle of Heineken and they were like they came out of an oven! 
Asked for late check out and the person cleaning the rooms was banging around the hallway like she was trying to get people out, even opened the door of the room we were in! Called for the shuttle bus and the driver said being smart, YE COULD HAVE WALKED, too smart for my liking, won't be staying ever again",1,2016,01,25
245,Dublin 2016,"it was the perfect location for what we wanted, room was fine good space with a decent shower, the bar downstairs was fine, food was nice with the prices very reasonable, would stay again if I got the same deal!!",4,2016,01,25
245,This is so convenient to the Airport its hard to beat,"If you have an early or late flight this is unbeatable in terms of closeness to teh Airport. The minibus to Terminal 1 and 2 leaves the hotel on a half hour basis and the drivers are professional and helpful. Checking in is good as the staff are friendly and professional and swift. The rooms are pleasant and have everything one needs. It would be nice, however, to leave a bottle or two of water in the room. The bar food is acceptable and the wait staff are good. ",4,2016,01,25
245,A BLOCK OF HOTEL ROOMS THAT HAS HAD ITS HEYDAY,"Being an exception to the usually good-quality Radisson Blu airport hotels chain, the Dublin Airport edition seems to be stuck in an era of about two decades ago, with provisionally touched-up bits of wall paint and crooked lampshades. The bar and restaurant area comes across quite dark, making you feel cold, there is no inhouse gym, and, arriving from Terminal 2, it’s not even easy to find. Somehow the signage must have gone lost. It’s a 7 minute walk - crossing a 4-lane ring road, or 2 min free shuttle between the hotel and the airport terminals.",2,2016,01,25
245,"Good for airport run, bad for everything else.","The good:
- The location is good if you have an early flight.
- Shuttle bus to airport.

The bad:
- Staff are ok but the welcome is lacking.

Let's get down to the room itself:
- The floor slopes down/up hill in certain parts near the bed. Feels like smoething under the carpet had been repaired (but incrorrectly).
- There is a huge stain next to the bed - We joked someone had been killde in the room as it looked like the size of an adult!
- Stains on all of the furniture
- Stains on bathroom floor
- Stains on bed sheets

I would definitely look elsewhere in future.",2,2016,01,25
245,Room felt like men's bathroom at airport,"The hotel was recommended due to schedule changes and a shortage of time before flight out of airport across the street. It was a convenient location and they did have a shuttle to take us to the airport early in the morning.   I have been very satisfied at other Radisson Blu establishments in other countries but was disappointed with the this one.   The lobby area was nice and the outside appearance of the building was appealing.   Tried to take a couple employees into the bar to get dinner (late in evening) and the service was very bad.  Was most disappointed with the room. Had the feel that 1000's of people had passed through, was very uncomfortable and felt unclean. Desk chair looked like someone got sick on it and had years of dirt build up on it. Pillow and sheets were very low quality and worn.  Will try to stay somewhere else when I return in the future.",1,2016,01,24
245,Out of date could be better!,"We stayed here for the evening before a flight out of Dublin Airport. It's a short walk from Terminal 1 and can be walked in about 5-6 mins and 7-8 mins from Terminal 2. 

We arrived at the hotel with the lift broken so we were on the 4th floor and had to walk up the stairs which was a pain with cases. 

The hotel is desperate for a makeover especially the rooms. Old fashioned rooms that are not to the standard of the Radisson. Stayed at a Radisson in December and was absolutely amazing compared. 

We had no hot water to start off and was told by reception that the water would be back on in a short while. 

The facilities at the airport are poor, gym and pool across the road but is closed all weekend for swimming lessons. It's a dump. It's an old stinking leisure centre which is old.

The hotel itself is run down even to the point where the actually letters of Raddison are missing so it says Radsn on the front.

Breakfast is lovely but not worth the 16.50euros per person.

Overall staff are nice but feel for them having to work in an old run down hotel. It's the service that is good at this hotel.

Walls are paper thin though so be warned....

245,Good hotel,Have to say it is a great hotel good location beside the airport. Room was very big only 2 things let it down the heating wasn't working in the room and was too cold and the food was ok not a great selection was more bar food than Restuarant but would stay again ,3,2016,01,23
245,Great hotel in airport grounds,"A big thank you to Muhammad the duty manager who welcomed us and made our stay very comfortable. 
Only one night stay as flying out next day. Our flight was at 6am and the hotel has a complimentary shuttle bus to terminal every 15mins. Very bright modern and has a nice bar & restaurant area. We didn't eat there, but it was busy and the menu had a good selection. We left our car in the on site carpark. Only €7.50 per day. ",5,2016,01,22
245,Could not fault this hotel at all,"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in for a while.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  I asked for an upper floor so it was quieter and they upgraded me (for free) to a business class room which was huge, with a coffee machine.  And it was quiet even next to the lift lobby.  Food good, breakfast excellent.  Free shuttle to airport.  There is absolutely nothing i could say against this hotel, very very good.",5,2016,01,21
245,nice hotel,Bedrooms was really nice and clean. I booked for two bedrooms and we was upgraded on a business class bedrooms with espresso machine... so really happy. We stayed just one night but i recommend this hotel when you are to the airport.,4,2016,01,19
245,Needs a make up!,"Noticed in the last number of months the hotel is not only getting more expensive, but the decor is starting to get old.  

Even if you look at the front of the hotel, there is only 4-5 letters of the 8 in the name of the hotel remaining.....first impressions!

The front desk staff are ALWAYS very friendly and welcoming and again, did not disappoint....

The bar staff are not as friendly or welcoming!

",3,2016,01,17
245,Awful noise,"Just got back from a holiday in Dublin which was a lovely city but this hotel really disappointed! We was woken up by a really loud banging coming from the room above which sounded like building work. The noise was like a steel hammer knocking on hard floor at full worse which woke me and my partner up at 7.30am. We could not get back to sleep with that noise! Bare in mind we had to catch a flight and had driving home to do. We was extremely tired as our plan was to be able to rest in bed late to be ready for our journey home. When we finally got to check out we politely told the lady at the desk that we wasn't happy with the noise coming from the room above. She said it was workmen working on the air conditioning, she wasn't sympathetic towards us at all, she was getting quite annoyed with us and didn't seem interested at our disappointment. She quickly rushed our checkout an said ""sorry there is nothing we can do as you have already pre paid through booking.com"" then said ""good bye everything has already paid for"" again we was left unsatisfied, tired and upset. I am really disappointed and I would never recommend this to anyone. I have video'd the banging as proof of how horrendous this noise was. It's just a real shame on the staff too. This really affected our journey home, driving on the motorway tired is really dangerous and for a hotel at the airport they should really be focused on giving their customers a good nights sleep for safety. ",1,2016,01,17
245,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","The Good 
1. Friendly and helpful staff 
2. Clean and modern facilities 
3. Excellent breakfast buffet 
4. Free shuttle ride to and from the airport 
5. Free high-speed internet 
6. Very reasonable price 

The Bad 
1. No in-room safe unless you book a business class room 
2. Breakfast is extra 

The Ugly 
1. Heating system cannot be controlled in room. If the temperature is not warm enough for you they will bring a portable heater in your room. 
2. Air conditioning is currently being installed. Didn't bother us though because it's winter.  But hopefully it will be finished by summer.

Overall a great stay.  The things we didn't like were minor and didn't bother us that much.  Thank you Radisson Blu for a memorable stay.  Thank you also for giving us a free upgrade to Business Class room during our last day.  That was a nice touch.",5,2016,01,14
245,Does the job!!,"I've stayed at the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport on numerous occasions. It's location and proximity to the terminals is perfect. There is always plenty parking and the courtesy shuttle is great. On this stay I had a business room on the second floor. While the room itself was perfectly adequate,comfortable bed and good sized bathroom the only problem was the adjoining door to the room next door. Not great unless you want to hear your neighbour breathing!! Breakfast is good with a varied selection and is included in the business room rate.",4,2016,01,14
245,Good Business Hotel,"It's within walking distance of the terminals, although he route in this age of car supremacy is a little convoluted, or exciting depending on how direct. Nice staff, genuinely welcoming, I had a business class room and it was very large and comfortable, although it's nearly time for a refurb. There is a good size pool and health club, but not within the hotel, pool walkable though.
Decent food in the restaurant as well. I'd certainly use it for Dublin airport.",4,2016,01,14
245,Great and handy for an early flight,"Great staff member drove us down to swords to a local pub and collected us after cant remember his name, a nice chatty local swords man he was so friendly, a relaxing hotel to eat and drink. Great if you have a long early flight like us, u eat sleep and get 2 the airport without stress by hotel shuttle bus",5,2016,01,13
245,Never Blue at Blu,"This is our third hotel stay at one of the Radisson Blu's in Dublin...our first at the airport.  It is a lovely hotel with many amenities.  Check the web for your needs/requirements.  This facility met ours very nicely:  nice room, efficient friendly staff.  It was a one evening stay over.  We would not hesitate to book it again if need arises.",5,2016,01,13
245,Excellent choice,"Stayed one night here as I was flying out very early the next morning. I always feel hotels are the same everywhere but Radisson proved me wrong! The staff were both efficient and friendly. They knew why we were staying so didn't over schmooze us. I was really impressed with the room quality. A very nice size, welcome chocolates etc etc. 
The key is that the hotel runs a 24 hour free shuttle to the airport. The drivers are exceptionally nice I must admit. On departure of the hotel, a quick breakfast of tea, coffee, fruit etc is available for free!!! Really recommend.  ",5,2016,01,12
245,Handy to stay if flying out of Dublin but average hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night as we had an early flight. Bathroom was very poor layout and toilet was not secured to the floor properly, a bit of a health an safety issue. Reception was quick enough, we ate dinner in the restaurrant and it was a good meal. Breakfast was a buffet and not really up to standard. Would only recommend as a place to stay for convenience to airport.",3,2016,01,11
245,Nice hotel,"We stayed here on our way back from New York when the second leg on our flight was cancelled due to bad weather. The room/suite we had was really nice a bit on the chilly side due to the weather and the fa t they were upgrading their air conditioning/heating element. The room was clean, we were provided with fresh towels as well as robes, and the room had its own coffee machine with complementary coffee/tea/hot chocolate. We ate both lunch and dinner here and the food was really good, and the waitress we had although being rushed off her feet with Christmas parties and guests from cancelled flights was very helpful and always had a smile and apologised if she thought she was longer than should have been. And it has free wifi which is always a bonus.",5,2016,01,09
245,Nice hotel if you don't get an adjoining room,"in general a decent hotel. BUT we got hardly any sleep as a result of being in a room with an internal adjoining door to the room next door. We were awakened abruptly by the noise, the light, the TV, the room service etc. etc. of our neighbours.. In fact, it felt like we were sharing a room with them. Very poor quality adjoining doors. Reuqire some sound and light proofing.",2,2016,01,08
245,Do not stay here,"Arrived into hotel after a long trip abroad. No queu system at reception. People can just walk in front of you and be served. Had to carry all my own heavy luggage to bedroom using trolley at door while porter could be seen hiding behind a pillar in foyer. No heat in rooms. Radiators do not work. Shower needed extreme force to tun on/off. Bathroom shabby with chipped sanitary ware. When eventually got shower on it was just a weak dribble of water. 
Next morning all electricity out. An electrical wire had caught fire in the hotel. As a result no lift, no breakfast no light. This is like a Basil Fawlty moment if it were not dangerous.
This hotel sports a 4 star grading from the Irish Tourist Board! 
Reminds me of the ' luxury grand ritz hotels' one comes across in Africa.
I would love to hear the Irish tourist boards explanation of its grading criteria!",1,2016,01,05
245,A few issues but handled well,We stayed here twice in the last few weeks on either end of our holiday. It is very convenient to the airport only downside is that we had to wait nearly fifteen minutes for a shuttle pickup after calling on arrival. I would usually walk but we had too many bags this time. This was only a problem because we had been told that the shuttle would be over in 5 minutes so we waited outside with our 18 month old daughter at 9:30pm in the cold. Staff at breakfast were friendly. I had an issue with the first stay with billing and once it was resolved I was pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade on our room on our way home. ,4,2016,01,04
245,"Nice big room, wifi bad","We got a free upgrade to a business room and the room itself was nice and big with a table and two chairs, desk with chair and a walk in wardrobe, plus a large bathroom. The bed was not too roomy though. It felt very modern. My only quibble was with the wifi, as it's an unsecure network I couldn't log in to my work apps and had to check out early to go elsewhere to get on the internet. I would have thought for a business room a more secure network would be available.",4,2016,01,04
245,Risky Business! Heartless Hotel...,"After staying at this airport hotel several times, I booked it again for a bed and breakfast deal directly on their website. Due to arrive on Tuesday, December 29, 2015, my travel plans were disrupted when flights were cancelled from the USA, due to a winter blizzard and horrific tornado in Texas that took more than twenty lives. It was a pure state of emergency and out of anyone's control. The airlines rebooked thousands of passengers traveling worldwide on refundable and Nonrefundable tickets, but not this hotel! Nonrefundable is Nonrefundable...not that I was looking for a refund! All I wanted was a change of date to whenever my new travel date would be. After calling the hotel to talk with a manager, I was connected to a receptionist, who said she understood and would get back to me via email. The email stated that nothing could be done to help me. How very sad. We would've dined and enjoyed a few cocktails in the restaurant there, bringing in more money to the hotel but no is no. Funny how things are much different when the tables are turned and countries are reversed. Much was the case during the student tragedy in Berkeley, CA. Airlines and hotels were so empathetic and showed what quality customer service really is. Have a heart. Very disappointed with this Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport! There are other hotels out there!",3,2016,01,03
245,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel. Modern, clean, quiet, comfortable, free-wifi, close to airport (Walking Distance) with free shuttle. Breakfast buffet was among the best I have had, with a huge selection of fresh Irish and international food. Very professional and helpful staff. ",4,2015,12,29
245,Convenient and helpful staff,We needed a last minute hotel room for less than 24 hrs and the staff when booking very fantastic and helpful. While the entrance looks modern and upbeat the rooms are a little tired looking but clean it suited our needs perfectly. Food was good and staff were welcoming. Really convenient for the airport. Would recommend it. ,4,2015,12,27
245,Very close to airport,"Stayed here in Novembee for a night before early morning flight. On arriving at airport shuttle bus stop was easy enough find outside terminal 1(just turn left and about two minute walk). Wasn't waiting very long for shuttle bus at all. Check in was fast. Staff were friendly and approachable. Had dinner in hotel. Resteraunt was busy but fast and staff were curteous. Room was lovely. Big,warm and with massive bathroom. Big TV in room.WIFI in hotel aswell. They had wake up call in the morning and on checkout there was a shuttlebus waiting to bring me back up to airport. Very good hotel. Would recommend to anyone and would stay there again. ",3,2015,12,27
245,Decent Hotel,"A decent hotel next door to the airport. Rooms are well equipped. Food is good at a reasonable price for the location. Parking €12 even though you stay there.
Staff are very friendly. WIFI is free and coverage is decent.",4,2015,12,26
245,average at best,"Stayed here before trip to Thailand.  I usually stay in Bewleys hotel but thought i'd give the Radisson a try.  I was disappointed to say the least. While the lobby was gorgeous the room was tired and needed tlc.  The bathroom was dated and tired.  not the worst hotel I've been in but definitely not worth the money despite upgrading to a business class room.

the regular menu was replaced with a carvey the food was dry and average at best.",3,2015,12,26
245,Exellent  and friendly ,A courtesy  bus to and from the  airport  and helped me in with our suitcases. Very friendly  staff and child friendly  room is lovely and made feel  really  welcome. Wake up calls available  . Had a meal with  my daughter  kids menu and early bird menu's available . Food Is lovely  x,5,2015,12,19
245,"Excellent position, nice structure","Hotel very close to Dublin airport, so perfect if you need an accomodation after losing a flight like happened to me or for business meeting. Probably more expensive than other hotels but it has been easy to place a  reservation in short time, so that's fine. The restaurant is excellent with lot of possibilities (for veggie also). Really appreciated coffee and snacks in the hall at 4am.",4,2015,12,17
245,Adore,Lovely room. staff everything. if I had to make a complaint it would be that ladies travelling alone with children be given that little extra attention. It is hard work and all hotels tend to treat you like a second class citizan,5,2015,12,15
245,Wished I had stayed at my usual hotel.......,"I was in two minds whether to write about my experiences at the Radisson.  I came to the conclusion that although I voiced my opinions to the Manager & he was extremely sympathetic to my complaints, I am hopeful that the matter will be resolved & I won't have the same issues in the future. 

I usually stay at an alternative hotel nearby but as I stayed at the Radisson a few years ago & never encountered any problems I thought I would come back again.

This time it was different & I wished I had gone back to my usual hotel. My plans to go out got cancelled so I stayed & worked on my laptop. After some time sitting on the hard office chair in the hotel room (see photo below) I experienced serious back discomfort (after having very minor problems since 2nd January!!) . My back ached when I went to bed & this was exacerbated by having an uncomfortable sleepless night & it worsened the following day. The bed would have been better if it didn't have a 45degree headboard (see photo) which I thought was rather unusual & totally un-necessary. 

That office chair & all similar ones should be dumped!! Most people have a laptop & therefore should be comfortable when working. 

One would expect to have a bedside table with good lighting to enable you to read your book however here I found it was more like a cupboard therefore the lighting was appalling & it was impossible to read a book (see photo below). You had to physically get out of bed to switch the light on & off which was not conducive to a comfortable night should you have to go to the bathroom in the night. 

The hospitality by all hotel staff is acceptable. The bar menu was nothing special & my personal choice was a huge let-down. The only other options to eat would be to take a ride to Swords which is about 10minutes by car & there are some excellent eating places there or alternatively take the 20minute bus ride into the City. The breakfast bar does have an extensive choice however the hot options were lukewarm. 

It is surprising that the most important factors in staying in a hotel are not considered here. It could tick all the boxes if the management actually thought & behaved like guests. 

The Radisson is not the best hotel I have ever stayed in but it is a modern hotel in an ideal location with it being walking distance from the airport......which is really the main reason I would not discount it in the future.",3,2015,12,14
245,Good place to get your head down before a flight,"I've stayed at the Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport several times; usually before getting a flight back home.

It's a perfectly decent airport hotel; the rooms are comfortable and workmanlike.  Food's pretty decent through room service and the bar is OK; though because it's Irish there's no decent beer better than Smithwick's.

The shuttle to and from the terminals is reliable.

Exactly what you need from an airport hotel, really.  I'd have no issue staying here again.",3,2015,12,13
245,Stay anything but here,"I arrived late (12:30am) to find out that the 24 hour shuttle doesn't run very often at night, and stood out in the rainy, cold Dublin night for 25 minutes (after calling) to wait for the shuttle.
The hotel is being renovated, so there's no heat/air.
Other things that didn't work in my room: phone (no dial tone), toilet (wouldn't flush), shower (no hot water), hair dyer (turned on, but barely blew a breeze). Oh, and the elevator would only go down if you pressed the up button, rode all the way up, then down.
Seriously, I wasn't looking for much, I checked in at 1am and out by 8am, but really, stay anywhere but here.",1,2015,12,08
245,worst hotel,"Booked this hotel 2 months and requested late check in as I was flying in at 1am arrived at reception at 1.30 and was told that they had a technical problem and are room was sold but they said they had a hotel for us 5 minutes away so we decided to go in a taxi I couldn't belive where they Brought us its cost €60 in a taxi to the city north hotel drogheda  how can u send your guest that far so late at night could u not find a hotel closer or even in the opposite direction,1 tip for u radisson hotel stop over booking,",1,2015,12,07
245,Ok for meeting in hotel,"This hotel is a good choice for a meeting in Dublin if you are flying there and do not want to stay more in the downtown area. Its ok as far as rooms and service goes. The only negative point I would give it is the lack of possibilities for eating/drinking in the area. Of course there is a restaurant in the hotel which is adequate, but if you are looking for a nice cozy restaurant serving good food - you will have to make the travel to the city.",3,2015,12,07
245,Best hotel ,"A lovely place, even better staff would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking around Dublin rooms are gorgeous food is gorgeous,will be booking again for the new year, and I have no doubt it will be as nice if not better than my last stay,

",5,2015,12,06
245,Great hotel,"We stayed here for the Dublin Marathon. We arrived late at night and were picked up from the airport (even though it is only 2 minutes walk from the terminal) in the shuttle bus.

We stayed two nights - breakfast was amazing! The room was spacious, very clean and well presented. The location is a bit far from the centre. However was much cheaper than hotels in the centre!",4,2015,12,03
245,TOLD LIES AND SOLD OUR ROOM.,"Me and my girlfriend were meant to stay in this hotel after flying in to Dublin airport after a holiday in September. We were not landing till 2am so we wanted somewhere close to the airport. My girlfriends dad booked a room for us for the night, got confirmation etc. He also rang the day before to let them know we would be a late arrival as we were flying in late and give the exact time. He was told this is no problem. Anyway we arrived at the hotel at about 2:30 am to be told the hotel was full. How could it be full if we had a room reserved? The manager on duty then said he may have a room available but in the end he did not. He blamed an error with the hotels system as to why basically our room was sold but its obvious they thought we were not coming and decided to sell our room. The manager ( Daniel) clearly lied and his excuses were very poor. Its clear that the message that we would be arriving late was not passed on or they simply did not care enough and just sold our room. Luckily we got a room at the regency hotel or else it was probably back to the airport to sleep. What bothers me the most was the fact he lied and made up excuses. I would never ever stay here again. How could you stay at a hotel after it sells your room and then lies to you? No where near 4 star service. More like a hostel",1,2015,12,02
245,An Airport Hotel ........,"Our room had no air conditioning. Never mind, we opened the window and it cooled a little but we found it hard to sleep with the airplane noise. Room seemed very Spartan and in need of refurbishment. Price was not bad compared to other hotels, but Dublin always seems overpriced. Airport shuttle prompt to get to the hotel, but insufficient capacity for the return journey; they put another on without  too much delay. Staff robotic.",2,2015,11,29
245,Great for early morning flight from Dublin,"This hotel had all I needed, comfortable bed,  tea and coffee tray,  shower with great water pressure,  free wifi.  It was a bit pricey but the convenience to get to the terminal within 5 minutes was worth it.  There is a shuttle bus but you can also walk.  Nice touch: a free early morning coffee with some fruit and a cereal snack in the lobby. 
Will go again. ",4,2015,11,29
245,No wifi in 36 hours and no solution,I paid a significant amount of money for this room for a business trip from Spain.  The wifi did not work for the duration of my stay.  I ended up going back to the airport to answer emails.  When I complained they said they were 'working on it' - for 36 hours!!!  When I complained afterwards I was offered a free upgrade on my next stay.  Are they kidding - I would not risk this happening again.  I have been in a hotel where the wifi failed in the past - they offered us mobile modems so that we could connect.  Would never stay again.,2,2015,11,25
245,Convenient & comfortable hotel,"Check in was very efficient, helpful & friendly staff.
An airline check in booth is located at reception which I used for Aer Lingus flight but other airlines available too. My colleague needed to print a boarding pass from an email & the receptionist dealt with it efficiently. Brilliant service.

We ate dinner in the bar & had salads which were well made & tasty. 

Rooms are comfy but beds are very low & tucked into a unit so you cant turn the lights on & off without getting out of bed which is a bit of a design flaw.

Had breakfast in the restaurant which was a buffet with a fantastic selection & you can order poached eggs- ace!!

Hotel runs shuttle buses to & from the airport frequently but be early incase you cant fit in the minibus & have to wait for another.",5,2015,11,22
245,Welcome to the Icebox,"I stayed 2 nights at the Radisson Blu at Dublin airport while on a business trip to Ireland.  The thing that sticks most in my mind is a conversation with the receptionist when I arrived back after a long day during which I had flown to England and back.  It was 9PM and I had struggled to find the hotel's shuttle bus (more about that later) and when finally reaching the hotel found that my room was icy cold.  On raising the matter it was disconcerting to be told that the situation was not going to change because the heating is only turned on 5-7PM and 5-7AM.  What the hell is that about!   They agreed to provide a small space heater and did so but that only partially solved the problem with just a small circle of heat if one crouched close enough.  

In addition one of the lifts was non-functional and from the semi-permanent look of the barrier at the door, it had been so for some time.  

That aside, the sleeping room was adequate.  It had a fold down double bed which was comfortable enough but seemed very odd in an international chain hotel.  The room was large but bare and had all the things that are essential from my point of view.  Good, free wifi, hairdryer, clean sheets, ample hot water in the shower, coffee making equipment.  

I found the hotel very quiet and slept well.  There was a breakfast available at extra cost but 19 Euros seemed far too much even for a good breakfast and I didn't take up the offer.

One of the main reasons for choosing this hotel was the shuttle to and from the airport.  They said it ran every 15 minutes and it seemed to do so.  I didn't wait longer than 5 minutes either morning.  The issue is finding it to get from the airport terminal to the hotel.  From where I arrived at terminal 2 it was quite a hike in the rain to where the shuttle picks up at terminal 1.  It is also a completely different place to all other shuttles and no one at the airport could tell me where it left from.  In the end I had to call the hotel (on my US cell phone) to get the information.  My advice is if you arrive at terminal 2 and have little luggage you walk to the hotel which is probably about the same distance as walking to the shuttle pick up spot.  

I would never consider staying at this hotel again because of the heating issue which is absolutely unacceptable in a chain hotel in a developed country.",2,2015,11,22
245,Not even average...,"The worst business hotel, I have ever been: rooms need a major renovation, I had to sleep on a foldaway bed, no mini bar, etc; 60 year Eastern Bloc charm; 
breakfast: dirty dishes and cuttlery, no cups for tea; 
meeting room: choice between cold without aircondition or loud with aircondition; low beamer quality; 
highlight: friendly and helpful front office ",1,2015,11,19
245,Good airport hotel,"Have stayed in this hotel a couple of times now on business and it served its purpose very well.  Location is excellent as even though they provide a 24 hour courtesy bus to the airport, it really isn't needed.  Literally a 5 minute work from the airport to the hotel. 

Staff were very helpful throughout, bar and restaurant were good and rooms fine.  Hotel is being refurbished so no aircon in the rooms - not an issue in winter.  

Used the 747 airport bus to get into the centre of Dublin and this worked well.",4,2015,11,19
245,Good Hotel at Dublin airport,"The Hotel is located at Dublin aiirport, with 24h mini-bus service to the Airport terminals.
Spacious and quiet rooms.
Nice restaurant and bar, good service, friendly atmosphere.
I would definetely suggest this Hotel for people leaving from Dublin airport early in the morning.",4,2015,11,18
245,Good choice for business travellers close to the terminal,"Everything you need from an airport hotel - a big comfy bed, plenty of space in which to wrestle with your luggage, a large spotlessly clean shower room, huge desk with excellent task lighting, reasonable room service offering and a regular shuttle to the terminal if you can't be bothered with the five minute walk.",4,2015,11,15
245,"Awful,","Reception was more interested in training the person rather than the client.  The room could do with a make over, metal soap dish hanging off the wall in the bathroom, hald the lights didn't work....no internet, Viewing eye on the door can only be used by a 6 foot person. Only good thing was the shuttle coach to the airport.   ",1,2015,11,15
245,Not the usual Radisson quality,"We stayed for one night prior to flying out of Dublin Airport.  I usually stay at airport Radissons and have a great experience and sadly that wasn't the case with this place.

We asked for a double bed and got given twins and the staff were kind of rude with us.  We were very tired and windblown when we arrived and they weren't helpful at all.  The place is going through a remodel and there was some banging from work crews and all in all it just wasn't the usual Radisson quality - for the price we expected much nicer and bigger rooms, the quality that is usually found at a Radisson.",3,2015,11,14
245,Convenient airport hotel,"Stayed here one night on way back from a conference.  Convenient location, with free shuttle bus to airport.  Quite expensive and rooms good but nothing special by modern standards given the price.

No gym in the hotel.

Left before 0630 so no breakfast - but that saved 11 Euro and I got a decent breakfast in the terminal for 8 Euro instead.

Room was expensive for what it was really so rated average overall.",3,2015,11,13
245,"Not the best, needs upgrading","For all the issues listed in this review, the staff claimed they were going through a remodel. So perhaps when they are finished, this hotel will be amazing. But in its current condition, I wouldn't recommend it.

There was no air-conditioning in the hotel. Its currently entering into winter in Dublin, but if you're like me, you don't like a warm humid, musty room. It was too warm to sleep.

There are no gym facilities are the hotel.

Room service was below average, even by european standards.

The rooms weren't dirty, but being dated and old, they didn't feel clean.

Bathrooms weren't clean.

They DID offer free Wi-Fi and it was walking distance to the Dublin Airport.",3,2015,11,12
245,Radisson Dublin Airport is good,"I regularly stay in this hotel when I'm going or coming back from abroad. Staff is very friendly and professional, although I see new faces every time I spend a couple of nights there. food and rooms are nice.",4,2015,11,11
245,Glad to leave!,"When I arrived at the property I was met by a very friendly front desk staff. Sadly, this was one of the only things nice about this place. When I reached my room it was almost like I was taken back to a hotel room from the 70's/80's very dull, old and with crooked pictures and light fixtures on the walls. What is it with some European hotels shutting the AC off or ""repairing"" after a certain time of the year. If my room has its own thermostat do not turn the entire unit off. Sleeping with heat blowing into my room is very uncomfortable and when it's in the 50's outside  this doesn't justify. 
I attempted to take a shower only to discover black hairs both long and ""short"" all over the walls and the basin looking very dirty as well. I went to to the front desk to inform them of the situation in my room I was moved to a ""business class"" room. Only difference this room had a coffee maker and they delivered me a table fan to accommodate the warm temp. However, this time the lights in the bathroom did not work, so I can't tell you if the bathroom was clean this time. The water pressure from the sink was stronger than the shower and the toilet wouldn't flush till after 4-5 attempts. I was granted free breakfast for the ""business class"" room. I'm so thankful I didn't pay for this. The buffet style was almost empty at every pan. I ordered a fresh omelette only to have it delivered undercooked, very oily and even green. I only ate a piece of toast and muffin from the breakfast Buffett. What hotel doesn't offer some type of fitness center especially at the airport. This hotel requires you to take a 5-10 minute shuttle ride to an off site Fitness complex, only to be hassled by locals who work out there.
Now to the good things about this place. A shuttle to and from the terminal, free fast wifi and the most attractive housekeepers, front desk and wait staff I've seen at a hotel in some time.   ",2,2015,11,10
245,Convenient but not so comfortable,"I stayed at this hotel overnight between flights.  Very convenient, but unfortunately I was very disappointed.  Although it was early November, they had already turned off their air conditioning system and it was a very warm day and the room was probably close to 80 degrees F (27 C) in temperature when I arrived late afternoon, too hot for me.   Room window only opened a crack.  They did bring me a fan though and a complimentary bottle of water when I complained.  Also, there are 2 elevators but one was being repaired and during the stay, the other elevator broke down, so no guest elevator for a few hours (I was 5 floors up).  I also found the internet a little slow and the water pressure in the shower was very low, tough to rinse off well.  It was great to get to the terminal the next morning with their free shuttle, which runs frequently, and the breakfast was good, but the most important factor for hotels is comfort and the issues noted above made it very difficult.",2,2015,11,09
245,Perfectly decent airport hotel,"Good airport hotel. Nice room, restaurant open until 10pm so good if you arrive late.  Only issue was room was very hot and temperature control didn't work, mentioned to reception on check out and told they would look into it.  Given some free water on check out which was a nice touch.",4,2015,11,08
245,"Very handy, lovely hotal","We where going to a wedding in portmarnock and this hotel was the closest available. It's. Very modern hotel and its s typical sas hotel. We had. Great room with a view over the airport. It wasn't noisy at all. If you want to head into Dublin the hotel has a courtesy bus which will take you to terminal 1 where you can get a bus into Dublin city centre. It's 10 Euros return which is cheaper than a taxi. When you come back from Dublin get off at terminal 2 and you can then walk over to the hotel. There is an onsite car park and you get a discount if staying in the hotel. We didn't pre book breakfast and I'm glad we didn't as you can order at the hotel in the evening and it's cheaper than vi the website.

Would definitely go back.",4,2015,11,08
245,Overnight Stopover,"Stayed as an overnight stopover for a very early flight. Modern interior, although they were still changing the interior in part of the level we were on but very spacious rooms, regular 15 minutes shuttle bus to T1, complementary pick up and go bfast and nespresso coffee machines in rooms and lobby. Also very useful - check in desks in the lobby for all airline carriers as well as free reading material including hard copy books for all. 

Overall very good airport hotel with all you need if your in for a very quick stopover, or very early/late flight!",4,2015,11,06
245,Pre Flight Stop Over.,"Reading the reviews on here . 
Some people are a little critical .

It is a Airport hotel .. 
So you are going to hear the planes. 

It is by a busy road leading to the airport...
So you are going to hear the traffic ...

It is closest hotel to the airport. Very busy and with a very high occupancy... 
So you are going to see signs of tiredness due to the way people abuse the hotel. 
Like a person smashing her cases in to the lift wall number of times as we departed.

But in the coarse of our stay we couldn't fault the staff or general customers service. From the receptionist through to the shuttle driver who was a comic.
We had a standard double with sofa bed. The sofa bed had a skinny mattress. House keeping provided additional mattress to beef it up ..
Room and bathroom clean .

Only down side was being limited to a premium priced restaurant providing Just ok food. 
Might suit having a bar menu as well as the dinning room menu.

We pre booked the car parking along with the room ( Is a must ).. This was so handy.. much quicker getting away upon our return than the normal airport car parking. Plus free shuttle from hotel to airport.

Will Defently use this hotel if we are flying out early again. 
Remember is a Airport hotel .. if you want peace and quite go to a country hotel.

",4,2015,11,05
245,Kindness and help,Caught in a bad situation with a booking not done and no rooms available the reception team and in particular Miss Imelda have been totally available and helpful in finding a room in another hotel . These are the kind of persons that I would like to see at any reception in the world. Thanks a lot for your attitude and professionality!!!,4,2015,11,05
245,"Dated and tired - don't expect Radisson blue standard, it's more like an old ibis","I have stayed in this hotel during a business trip in November 2015.

On the positive side, the hotel is very close to the airport (approx 5min walk to Terminal 2) and the hotel is clean. The breakfast offering is acceptable.

On the other hand, the hotel does not provide nowhere near the standard I have experienced at Radisson Blue hotel in either Stansted or Zurich airports. The hotel is dated, rooms are shabby are feel extremely tired. Bathroom facilties are from the 1980ies and I have flooded my room several times while showering. Windows are old and not very sound proof. Furniture has seen better times as well. Additionally, the hotel cannot provide air conditioning until spring 16 given current engineering work - and they put a letter in the room where they say they are happy about this development (which is a shame for a Radisson). Internet allows only access for 1 phone or laptop at a time.

In summary, if you need an overnight stay at the airport 1 night might be ok, but avoid if you are used to 4 star and above standard. This hotel provides what you can expect of a dated low budget hotel and is in my opinion too expensive. Avoid.",2,2015,11,04
245,Disappointing,"Staff wasn't particularly friendly. Had to call 3 times to finally get an iron (which you would expect to be in every room for this type of hotels).  Temperature in the bedroom was very high, with the window fully open to let some cold air in and try to limit this. Unable to control or switch down the heater, first time I see this in a hotel.  The hotel's restaurant was very expensive and very limited in choice. Slow internet and disconnecting all the time. Bathroom had a terrible smell of cigarette.",2,2015,10,31
245,Convenient for early morning flights!,"We stayed here as a family the night before our early morning flight.  As other reviewers have said, the hotel is in much need of a refurbishment.  Especially the hallways to the rooms.  The room and bathroom were however clean.  There is also great soundproofing even though you are in the middle of the airport.  The only complaint I would have would be the sofa bed in the room.  We booked a family room and expected two double beds.  The second bed was a very wobbly small sofa bed for our two teenage daughters.  The mattress on the bed was very thin, and they both did not get any sleep before our flight, as they felt every spring underneath!",3,2015,10,29
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport,"This hotel gets top marks for location and is only a one minute shuttle ride from the airport, making it very convenient for travelers catching early flights.  However the place is showing its age and in dire need of a facelift. During my stay the lifts were intermittently on the blink and I had to take the stairs a few times.  Staff are friendly but not as helpful one would expect in a business oriented hotel. Room, bed, and breakfast was first class. As stated above the hotel is next door to the airport and management may believe that this alone is enough to guarantee a full house.",3,2015,10,29
245,Clean and convenient hotel with friendly and efficient staff,We stayed here two nights prior to departure from Dublin airport returning to the U.S.  The hotel staff was efficient and our room was very clean.  We ate two very well prepared breakfasts at the hotel restaurant and use the bar once.  Everything about the stay was very good and I would definitely stay here again.  The bad reviews for this location don't match our experience.,5,2015,10,29
245,Filthy,"Very disappointing from a Radisson. Despite many grim reviews, I see that hotel management just post the same stock response. The rooms are very hit and miss - some okay, others in need of a refurb, but the bathrooms consistently are filthy - musty and the tiles are covered with mould. I did say to reception, who simply offered me a free breakfast. Very poor show and not an experience I plan on repeating. Sadly this is a hotel I have used often in the past, but this has really put me off. ",1,2015,10,27
245,Convenient Spot to Stay,"We pulled up to this place at the end of the of our two week vacation. It was nice and close to the airport as we had an early morning flight. Check in was easy and the staff friendly. The room was clean and very spacious. Bathroom was well equipped with shampoo, soap and other things.",4,2015,10,27
245,"Nice location, great staff","Easy access from the airport and into Dublin for evening meetings. The staff were excellent and the food and restaurant service were wonderful. However the hotel is looking tired and in need of some TLC. Would I revisit? Probably yes, however I will be trying the local alternative hotels next time.",3,2015,10,26
245,Good hotel but pricey for the room,"Room not that big, there were 3 of us, no wifi in room. Breakfast was the best part, very good breakfast before heading off on our flight. Room was quiet, which was important, would consider staying again but felt it was a but expensive",4,2015,10,26
245,Should be better for the price,"You're definitely paying for the Radisson name here - and not much else. Stayed here in August for one night before an early flight out of Dublin. Check-in staff was pleasant and polite, but there was a long line behind us when she finally finished our check-in. 
Room was fine - clean though the carpets were rather worn. The bed was a murphy bed though (the kind that fold out of the wall)! It was too expensive of a hotel to be sleeping on a bed that obviously had no box springs of any kind and was just a mattress on a fold out wire frame. Set up around the beds is also strange (no plugs and the bed is set into a cabinet frame so you can't access the side tables- probably because it's a murphy bed!!!!!) 
We also tried to go for some food in the hotel bar but were unable to get any food as it was past 10 o'clock (it was about 10:02). I've worked in restaurants before and I know waitstaff work hard and want to go home, but this is an airport hotel. I couldn't believe the entire kitchen closed at 10 pm and I thought it was strange that the front desk staff didn't tell us that upon check in (just a few minutes previous). 
We ended up getting food from room service, which was not bad and fairly reasonably priced. It was just a frustrating experience from check-in to check-out and we will certainly stay elsewhere in the future.",2,2015,10,25
245,Really should be better,"The room is for the most part okay. The bed is comfortable, the en suite is fine and there is plenty of space. However, there is no free plug near the desk for a laptop. The chair was uncomfortable, as was the sofa. There is nowhere to hang a wet coat. The restaurant was the main disappointment. Marooned at the airport there was little choice but to eat at the hotel. I should say that the serving staff were excellent. The menu, however, was most uninspiring. I ate there twice and the food was luke warm and on one occasion undercooked. It was nicely presented though and the chocolate and orange truffle with caramel ice-cream was delicious. ",3,2015,10,21
245,Convenient Location,"Helpful, friendly staff.  You can't get any closer to the airport!  Expected the rooms of a Radisson to be a bit more posh.  No free parking.  24 hour shuttle was great.  Rooms are not soundproof!  The attached restaurant (T3) had exceptional food!",4,2015,10,20
245,Avoid At All Costs - Lots of Better Options,"When we arrived for this reservation the hotel had the reservation for my wife and myself but did not have the reservation for the friends travelling with us. 

The hotel found a room for our friends but they had to move out of it because of the smell of cat urine.

The three rooms we saw were in horrible condition. For example:

1.	The carpets hallways were all dirty and badly damaged. Any painting done was cheaply done and of poor quality. There were splits and tears in the carpets so you had to watch your step for fear of tripping. 
2.	The common areas were untidy and dirty with waste bins over flowing especially in places like the elevator.  
3.	The first room for our friends was rejected as it smelled of cat urine. 
4.	For a room for a late arrival and an early flight our room would do but it was like a room from the 1960's with poor paint, lots of damages, damaged carpet, and accessories that didn't work. For instance there was one of those pant pressing machines popular in the 1970's but it was in two pieces and clearly not working. 
5.	The chairs in our room were dirty and stained (see attached) and we wouldn't sit in them‎. 
6.	The bath was functional but again poorly cleaned with long dark hairs in the bathtub.
7.	We met our friends in the ""bar"" for a drink which was the corner of a large function room with a bartender who dropped by occasionally. 
8. WiFi was not working in the whole hotel.
9. The room was an accessible room, except the closet hangers were none removal and too shallow to hold a coat or a pair of pants.",1,2015,10,20
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport,"I recently stayed with my partner at the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport. I would not recommend staying in this hotel. There was no wifi, we received a very smelly room, staff were unfriendly on check-in, there was an additional price for parking. Overall terrible value for money.",1,2015,10,19
245,Quiet Hotel,"Hotel is in a great location for a close stay to he airport. Good quick check in with a nice clean spacious room. We paid for a Business class room which had a nice sofa and good sized TV. We were supposed to have free Internet , however due a problem in the hotel we had no Internet for the entire duration of our stay .Not good considering we had paid extra for a business lass room to include Internet .",3,2015,10,18
245,Advice: steer well clear of this hotel,"If you are thinking of staying at the Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport you need to read this review, especially if you intend arriving late. Here is what happened to us (couple in our 60s from Ireland) when we booked direct with this hotel for a one-night stay October 15/16. Our online booking stated that we would be arriving after midnight on a flight from Spain. Their booking confirmation confirmed our late arrival. When we got to the hotel around 1 o’clock in the morning the duty manager (not a native speaker of English) said the hotel had given our room to somebody else and they had no further rooms available. How come? Good question. The duty manager came up with a cock-and-bull story about a system failure having wiped out our reservation, but was instantly able to produce the pre-printed check-in form when I asked whether he had my phone number (I insisted the general manager call me next day; he didn’t). In the midst of this shambles, the duty manager said we should be happy because he had “good news” for us. The goods news was that they had booked us into the nearby Maldron hotel. When we go there they wanted to charge us 50 euro more than the Radisson, but after haggling with their duty manager we got the price down to the Radisson level at around 2 o'clock in the morning. The Maldron actually ended up apologising to us because, they said, they received the request from the Radisson at the last minute with no real details of the circumstances. A cynic might say the Radisson simply assumed we would not be turning up (despite confirming our late arrival) and resold the room ahead of charging the full price to my credit card for a no-show. I do not know this for a fact. Instead of phoning me the general manager sent me an email late next day with a different version of events than the one given by his night manager. The email was obviously crafted around a standard response because it referred to my email (I never sent them an email). It contained the usual sickening excuses and assured us that they understood our “frustration” – yes, that’s the word the man used, frustration. Given the scale and timing of their gross incompetence – not to mention breaking their contract with us – you would have expected the Radisson to do the decent thing and foot the bill at the other hotel, right? Wrong. Instead, the general manager said he would be delighted to offer me a free lunch/dinner and room upgrade on my next visit. Why would any sane person make another booking with a hotel so manifestly inefficient that it cannot manage its own bookings? It’s up to you friends, but my advice would be to steer well clear of this hotel. Use it only if there is no other option at the airport.",1,2015,10,17
245,Would Absolutely stay here Every time!,"This is the closest hotel to the airport by far, they have their own shuttle bus to, but it's only a 7 or 8 minute walk, and 25 minutes to the City Centre by 747 Bus or AirCoach.

On arrival, Staff were friendly, pleasant with a welcoming smile, and allowed me to check in at around 12pm, 2 hours ahead of Official check in time.

Room (406) was extremely clean, and not a bad view either, considering it was the airport.
Room service are polite, friendly and always smiling, food was delicious, fresh and piping hot every time, recommend the Irish Stew!!

The Room Cleaning girls, same mode, happy, smiling, very friendly and didn't bother you too early like some hotels will do.

Check out was officially 11:00am, but again I was allowed a late check out at 1:00pm.
Very Flexible with most things, oh and free Wi-Fi Signal was excellent, on three devices, no drop in signal at all.

Overall, very pleased, lovely stay!",5,2015,10,15
245,Will Not Stay Here Again,I can not believe that this hotel charges its guests to park in their parking lot. Only place in Ireland I found this. Only 1 bath towel for 2 people. Shower was dirty. Table in room looked like someone used a hammer on it in sections. Only one elevator working. Service in T3 restaurant was extremely slow and there were only 7 people total in there. Must have waited 15 min to get my beer which the bartender poured 10 min earlier and it sat till I said something. Hate to see when they are really busy. We were so disappointed with this place we checked out early and went somewhere else for breakfast. We will not stay here again when we come back. Out of the 5 places we stay in Ireland this was by far the worst.,2,2015,10,12
245,STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE MORE BAD DESIGN,"This is the third time I've reviewed this hotel. The business rooms went from bad to better but the standard rooms are badly designed, the service has gone downhill, the food is not great and the 'every 15 minute' shuttle to pick up the weary traveller has become 30-40 minutes and several phone calls to the hotel. Its very handy to the terminals which is just as well as it is often quicker to walk than wait for the shuttle bus which seems to turn up or not when it pleases. Check-in for an airport hotel saw one person behind the desk. I was offered a free drink from the bar for having to wait for the shuttle bus which i duly presented only to find the waiter had slipped it back on my bill for payment. Luckily I half expected it and had it removed. The basic rooms seem to have been designed by a complete moron. The only outlets [sockets] are hidden behind the TV and one practically needs an extension cord to plug in. The coffee pot/kettle is screwed to a wooden tray and has a short cord that barely reaches the plugs behind the TV. Who would want to steal this plastic kettle anyway? One bar of soap in paper which is near impossible to open. One towel. 'Reuse and save lives' it says on it. Really???? By the time the kettle is plugged in, your phone is charging and the TV is on there is no room for a laptop on the desk. Last time I pointed out design errors in business rooms they seemed to have been put right. These standard rooms need completely refurbishing with more  than a little thought. It rains a lot in Ireland. Mercifully it did not today or 40 minutes waiting in the wet for the every 15 minute shuttle would have made things even more miserable.",2,2015,10,12
245,Great for a one night stay,Very close to airport for a morning flight out.  Also if you want to go into the city the shuttle will take you to the 747 bus which is 6 Euro to a direct bus ride into the city.  They could boost their internet it is slow and I am only uploading emails.,4,2015,10,12
245,Don't stay here if you can avoid it,"Paid for room in advance, then not available at check-in. Hotel staff tried to transfer me to another hotel in a rude manner. Staff made a number of dishonest statements (including all rooms being occupied). However a room became available when I refused to be relocated",1,2015,10,11
245,Perfect.,"This hotel is perfect for us and have stayed here often. Handy for the airport, especially if you have an early morning flight. It's an easy walk to the airport, but they also offer a shuttle. The beds are very comfortable, room is adequate and clean. The 747 express or 16 will easily bring you into town.",5,2015,10,09
245,Great for an overnight stay in Dublin close to Terminal 2,"We liked the close proximity to Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport. We walked to the hotel with our luggage since it was a relatively nice afternoon and we could see the hotel from the terminal. However we did make the mistake that another reviewer warned of--- we cut across towards the Maldron Hotel from Terminal 2 instead of following  the sidewalk that initially runs parallel to Terminal 2 and crossing over at crosswalks. The mad dash across the busy road with luggage was not good.
The bed was comfortable but my husband did not like the pillows saying there were too stiff.
At time we were there, one of the elevators was under repair.
The restaurant offers a buffet breakfast, but we opted for the lounge area on the other side of the lobby, where you can order a la carte items like oatmeal and toast.
They have an airport van that runs regularly and takes you to the terminal where you can catch the Airlink Bus to downtown Dublin. 
The wifi was a bit slow joining, but we would definitely stay here again---the location was ideal!",4,2015,10,04
245,Perfect for an early flight out of Dublin,"Very modern, clean, friendly hotel. Great rooms. Very comfy bed and linens. Never could figure out how the fixed shower head worked but the wand was fine. No ice machine so had to make a trip to the bar for every glass of ice. No bottled water in room. No gift shop. The dining room is quite nice. The fish chowder was exceptional. My husband ordered a steak which was lack lustre. Service in the dining room was not great. But the service to the airport was also exceptional. Our driver was very pleasant and helpful.",5,2015,10,02
245,Radisson Blue Dublin Airport,Room very noisy with flights taking off and landing. First room was overheated with no way to reduce it. Had to move to another room on the first floor with a view or a very durty balcony. Very old style.  High price for value.  Personal very nice.,2,2015,10,02
245,What a great place to stay.,My husband and I came for a woodturners seminar and the service we and the other delegates received was superb. Nothing was too mucg trouble for the staff and this ensured a really stress free weekend.,5,2015,09,30
245,Very disappointed,"We started by being treated rather rudely at the front desk then went to our room and had to call down to 
get someone to come fix the broken window that wouldn't shut. The person on the phone was very rude as well. 

Went to dinner and had a very mediocre meal with the waitress arguing with us about our order of a bottle of wine. When we finally got the wine it took 2 additional waitstaff and a significant amount of time to get the bottle open. My food was served cold and I had to ask to have it heated. They actually didn't have large bottles of water and you have to buy several small ones if you like bottled water in your room. 

The bed is comfortable and I got a good rate so if you want to be close to the airport and sleep well this hotel will do as long as you don't expect 4 star service or even common courtesy. This is more of a budget hotel and not what it is advertised to be. ",3,2015,09,29
245,Disappointed ,"Very unfriendly, bordering on rude desk staff, not very helpful. Hallways very dark and dingy, very dirty carpets. Breakfast buffet cold. Rooms seemed recently redone and were nice. The person taking us to the airport was very helpful and kind. ",2,2015,09,28
245,Ehh ,"It not a bad hotel but it's not great. The location at airport is ok for flying but the traffic noise outside from cars is annoying. 
Elevators yes, one only works and is really small, people were getting mad waiting for elevator and several people took stairs then wait . 
The front desk always seemed a bit overwhelmed like they needed one more person on duty. 
The food in restaurant was ok but lacking anything special. 
No gym at hotel was told at desk if I wanted a work out to go to shuttle bus and they would take me some where. 
There is a McDonalds and petro/gas station all in walking distance . Just be mindful of highway traffic, they fly down the road .",3,2015,09,28
245,Very pleasant stay,"This is the second time I've stayed here. First time was the night before an early flight and I found the hotel to be clean and the food was delicious. The reception staff very very pleasant and helpful. 
The second time I stayed because of my first experience. After driving for 8 hours I decided to stop for the night. Again the restaurant had wonderful food and the rooms to their usual spotless standard.
Only negative is having to pay for parking while staying, even though it is at a reduced rate it should be included for the nights you're staying there.
I still plan on staying again within the next month.",4,2015,09,27
245,Disappointed,"I have been left quite disappointed with my recent stay at Radisson Blu, Dublin Airport. Upon check-in, everything was fine - gentleman who checked me in was pleasant and efficient. When I got to my room firstly the bin was not emptied from the previous guests, secondly - the bed in my room was built around furniture; however, the mattress was too big for the bed. When I lay down - there was a gap so big that my torso area was not even on the mattress. When I tried to ring reception there was no working telephone to do so, so I had to go down in the lift. It was a different gentleman at reception this time than to who checked me in and he could not have been more apologetic or helpful...offered immediately for me to switch rooms and to escort my belongings to the other room, then telephoned to make sure I had settled into the new room and that everything was ok. As this man had been so nice about the situation I did not believe it was an issue a moving rooms was not a big hassle so I soon forgot about it. A few hours after this I got hungry and decided to ring room service - there was no room service menu in my room so I decided to telephone anyway and get a brief description of things available to me. The man who answered the phone was probably the most rude man I have came across in my life. ""Yes"" he answered. I explained about the menu situation and that I would like a brief on what was on the menu ""well what would you like!"" He asked...I replied by saying I wasn't sure so once again could be give me a short few options ""I can make you anything he sighed. Just tell me what you want!"" Abruptly....once again I explained that I wasn't sure and could he just read the menu out to me....and once again he replied with ""just tell me what u want"" (in a rude tone). I got so annoyed that I put the phone down on him. An hour or more passed and I once again telephoned as i was hungry...I decided on Caesar Salad as I assumed every hotel has Caesar salad. The brief conversation with the same gentleman was very quick as I knew what I wanted however It took quite a few times explaining as he was muttering to someone else during our phone call so I recited my order a few times. Approx 20 minutes later my door knocked...or should I say got banged...I heard muttering outside...opened the door and there stood a man with my room service...on the phone angrily speaking to someone else. From his accent I knew it was the same man who had been on the phone to me. He set my room service on the bed didn't speak a word...set the recipet on the bed, hurriedly and angrily pointed a few times at the total price on the reciept without saying one word as if to say ""that's the total so pay now""...all while he is still speaking on the telephone. I could briefly hear the conversation and it was another customer in the hotel getting the same rude telephone manner I had received. I handed the man (named Yves by the way) his money and he did not once say please thank you or utter any words for that matter. When I opened my food I seen that it had came without the chicken and I still had been charged the full amount. I was so annoyed by how I had previously been treated that I did not bother to ring down and explain this situation as being honest how forceful and angrily he spoke to the other person in my room on the phone slightly intimated me and I did not feel comfortable being in my own room with him.

I have previously stayed at this hotel and had not one problem. I cannot commend the reception staff enough for how friendly and helpful they where and if there is a problem they are immediately willing to fix it, however due to the actions of that one member of staff I would not stay here again.",3,2015,09,25
245,Absolute luxury,"I stayed just for 1 night in this hotel and was blown away. The room was ultra modern and quite large, with a coffee maker, flat screen TV, gorgeous bathroom and the best bed Ive ever slept in, in a hotel. There was a fresh morning gown and slippers layed out in the wardrobe and gorgeous little shampoos and lotions displayed on the bathroom sink. Free wifi in the whole hotel with really good signal. We stayed on the 5th floor, and the view was amazing. The staff were so professional and accommodating. There was 24hour room service, and the menu was so appealing with home-made and freshly baked foods during all hours. It was such a classy relaxing place I will be 100% return for a longer stay!",5,2015,09,25
245,Better than most,"Very good Airport Hotel , friendly staff , clean and efficient . As Airport Hotels go this is one of the better ones I stay in. It is close enough to the terminals to walk to on arrival if it's not raining! , otherwise there is a frequent shuttle. Staff are very attentive , buffet breakfast good value . Rooms are spacious and well equipped . Business rooms a good choice .",5,2015,09,23
245,DONT LOOK PAST HERE!!!!,"Unfortunately it was a short stay but it was a perfect location considering we had an early flight. Such handy services as in early c/out, 24hr shuttle to airport door and grab and go breakfast aswell as check in kiosks for those not up on technology (using web/or on phones) Highly recommended.  Lovely atmosphere. Highly recommend :) T3 restaurant is a most for food and for the lovely Carlsberg :)  Everything was top notch...Best hotel I've ever stayed by a country mile!!  11/10",5,2015,09,22
245,Disappointed,"From the beginning, check-in was slow.  Many folks in lobby awaiting assistance.  Traffic jam in parking lot and other patrons complaining looking for someone to help move cars.

Hotel is old.  Decor and furnishings are old.  Sleeping rooms are old.  Walls haven't been painted or only touched up for long time.  Bathroom was small.  Toilet is about 1 foot from wall so hard to sit with knees and face up against wall.  Room did not have an iron although it had a pant presser.

Didn't find any vending machines or sundries store.

Shuttle to airport in morning was frequent and efficient.  Could actually walk as well.

I did order room service and that was timely and tasty.  Before staying here again, I would look for other options especially in this price range.",2,2015,09,18
245,Overnight convenience,"We stayed here for one night only due to an early departure to San Juan. We got straight onto the free hotel shuttle, arrived at 10 o'clock and asked if we could leave our suitcases since we were going into the city. The receptionist  checked our room (business class) and said it was ready and we could go straight up. Bonus!!!

The room had everything you would need for an overnight stay, including a large bathroom, designer toiletries and a great view. In spite of being literally right next to the airport, we experienced no aircraft noise. 

After returning from the city we had a few drinks in the bar and a light dinner. The drinks were expensive (to be expected) but the food was good value.

The bed was comfortable and after a good nights sleep we went down to check out at 6:00. All very painless and in less than 5 minutes we were on their free shuttle to our terminal. 

Overall, I would recommend this hotel for an overnight stay - the staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable and the hotel does exactly what it says it will do. We will definitely stay her again on our next flight to the USA/Caribbean.",4,2015,09,18
245,Good airport location,"we overnighted for early morning flight 
Room was spotless & spacious
Bus service to terminal was good but noticed a number were left behind because of bus capacity
Car park facility was very good- we arrived early around mid day & they had room ready as requested",4,2015,09,18
245,"expensive, good but not design","I was expecting a design hotel here, but I was wrong. This seemed more like a normal hotel. I remember when Radisson Blu started as a re-invention of Radisson, it was more about design. This is more ordinary. Do not get me wrong, it is a luxureous hotel, but also expensive. Parking is extra, but ofcourse there is the free shuttle bus to the airport (every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day). I had a very early flight, and free coffee and fruit where waiting for travelers to enjoy. The parking however, was completely filled up. It seems travelers can pay to leave there car when they fly to other destinations. But the parking of the hotel does simply not have the capacity for this service. The rooms were nice and quite large and equiped with a good and silent air conditioning unit. The free wifi worked. And the power outlets were available both in UK and European version. very clever and handy for the international business traveler.
The bar / restaurant area was a bit bland (and a bit cold). We did not really enjoy visiting this area and I really think they should make it nicer.",4,2015,09,17
245,Very convient,Stayed for one night to fly out early next morning.   Bed was only 15 inches off floor with a wood surround on base walked into it three times.  Breakfast was poor and on a cold plate.     However being only there for 6 hours and shuttle to airport offset any displeasure as was able to leave car as part of package,3,2015,09,17
245,"Wonderful, did not want to leave...............","Stayed here recently during a trip to Ireland. I loved every minute of my stay and cant wait to return.
It is a bit pricy, however worth every single cent, you actually get what you pay for a rarity these days.........
The hotel is roughly three minutes from the front door of Dublin Airport, when we arrived after travelling all night , we walked out the airport door and across the road to the hotel. 
The check in staff were polite, helpful and ultra professional. The foyer is simply beautiful and welcoming. 
My room was spacious , spotless, bright and comfortable. I slept all day, and had room service for dinner, the price average for Ireland and the food was excellent.
I had such a lovely restful sleep that I cancelled my trip south the next day and spent a second day in the hotel. The breakfast buffet was delicious, lots of food, and a nice dining room. 
Following my breakfast I walked over to the hotel and caught a bus into the city centre, about an hour journey but as I was on vacation, a wonderful way to just sit on the top deck and look at landmarks.
Next time I am back in Ireland I will spend 4 days in this hotel. wonderful
I just cannot say enough things about this lovely hotel To the wonderful staff,
""Go raibh maith agat""
Thank you.",5,2015,09,16
245,Great Place to Stay!,"If you want a good spot for a flight out, your search is over.  This is an excellent hotel on all counts.  Staff is excellent.  Restaurant and bar services are very good and the room was clean and spacious.  Walking distance to the airport terminal.  From check in to departure this is a great location to stay.  This would clearly be my choice of hotels for my next visit to the area.",5,2015,09,16
245,Handy place for a bite before you fly,"Popped into the hotel bar for a meal before a late night flight. Nice menu, super friendly service (no Irish accents though...) and satisfactory meal. Needed to get away from the cafeteria style food and not wanting a full on restaurant so this met my needs exactly. Good atmosphere, with a mixed older crowd, lots of business people and travelers. Good timing, no waiting for food. And the chocolate mousse desert was worth the extra weight!",5,2015,09,15
245,Great Breakfast,"The only thing I can say about this hotel is that it has a great breakfast. Service was horrendous. The room (suite) wasn't a suite, it just looked like a regular room. I would never go back again as staff members acted as if they were more important than the guests. We were some kind of inconvenience to them.",2,2015,09,15
245,Overnght to catch a morning flight,"Very handy, good conditions an offers every 15 minutes a 24 hours shuttle service at T1 and T2.
Dublin airport also offers couch facilities if need to visit a near city or even to do a Dublin city tour.
Plan to take an extra little time to check in into flights, security always takes good 30 minutes.",5,2015,09,15
245,Far from the city,It was an ok Hotel with average accommodations. Not sure I would recommend this Hotel but if you need a quick Hotel it will do the job. The rooms and a nice size with a full working area which I liked.,3,2015,09,14
245,Wish we'd booked the Maldron!,"We booked a couple of day rooms for 10am til 3.30pm weeks prior to our arrival on Sunday morning after a long haul flight from the US until our connecting flight.  As we left the terminal the hotel driver (who whiffed a little like a barmaid's apron) was just about to leave so we were able to use the complimentary shuttle.  On our arrival at the hotel at 9.55am, exhausted and ready to drop, we were advised that our rooms were not ready because the hotel had been fully booked on the previous night, a very poor excuse for an airport hotel with over 200 rooms and computerised systems.  After around half an hour we got our keys and went up to the rooms, luckily we were literally about to drop otherwise I would have had something to say about the disgusting view of the bins from one room, surely in this modern age the hotel could erect something either over the bin enclosure or from the side of the building to conceal it, it really was very off putting.  The room was nothing special, we had only been left Earl Grey teabags and for a triple room only provided toiletries for two people.  On the up side the hotel reception, bar and housekeeping staff we encountered were all very nice.",2,2015,09,13
245,Comfortable hotel in need of an upgrade,"There were things about this hotel that were great - close proximity to the airport (within walking distance of the Aer Lingus arrivals area), the lobby area is welcoming, and there is a full serve restaurant and bar in the hotel. The rooms are in need of a major upgrade, especially more attention to decorating and cleanliness (the rugs definitely need to be replaced or cleaned more frequently). I did appreciate the in room coffee, the quiet location of the room for an early morning flight (unlike some of the other reviewers who had a different experience with noise) and the stable wifi. I'd stay again if I needed an airport hotel in Dublin, and could get a decent price.",3,2015,09,13
245,Speechless is the word,"Before we arrived at our final night in Ireland, we exchanged emails with this property asking for a quiet room on a higher floor because our next day flight was leaving very early in the morning.  We were travelling with a child so this was important to us. The hotel confirmed this request. Imagine our surprise when we arrived and found out that the room was located on the first floor and was overlooking hotel's garbage cans. As the room was set up to accommodate our child, we were just too tired to change the room and decide to stay. Things went from bad to worse. After coming back from dinner in city centre, we discovered that hotel stuff was dragging old couches near the garbage cans. So we closed the windows to keep the noise out and went to sleep. At 2am we were woken up by hotel staff still moving some other stuff outside. After about an hour we called the front desk asking them to look into it. Imagine our surprise when the first question the front clerk asked us on the phone was: well did you close your windows? This is in a hotel that has NO AIR CONDITIONING IN THE ROOM. Well our window was closed and we still couldn't sleep. The front desk went to talk to whoever was making the noise and the noise stopped. We went back to sleep. Literally 45 minutes later we were woken up by not one but TWO garbage trucks taking away the garbage. That was at 4AM. To say that we were literally running out of that hotel as fast as we could would be an understatement.",1,2015,09,11
245,Not great ,Quite simply it needs a full refurbishment soon to compete with the Maldron hotel opposite. Check-in was slow as the queue was long and the room looks dated. Levels were downgraded the toiletries unfortunately. The room is also quite small. However the service was quite good as they kindly opened up the sofa bed for my daughter. There was also a nice breakfast spread at the lobby for fuchsin catching an early flight,3,2015,09,10
245,interesting night,"I stayed here for a night before I went on my holidays
staff were very helpful especially those on the check in desk
got discount for buying food in hotel
shuttle bus very helpful and on time
paid extra for upgrade and it was worth it",5,2015,09,09
245,Never again.,"I and two of my colleagues stayed at this hotel for one night prior to leaving Ireland.  We checked in c.3p, unpacked a bit and went into Dublin for some dinner and to experience Dublin.  We returned c.1a.  When I went to my room, my key didn't work.  I went to the front desk, gave them my room number and they gave me another key telling me i had the wrong room number.  Thinking maybe the Guiness was playing with my memory, I went back to the floor and approached the 'new' room.  I returned to the desk telling them that I knew for a fact that my room was not on the other side of the hall.  THAT was when they told me that they moved my room after I had left!  They said they needed the room for another guest!  They entered my room, packed up my things, and checked me out of that room!  I was not shy in expressing displeasure to the desk clerk --- he offered me breakfast (I told him it was included in my rate already) he offered to have it delivered to my room (I told I was leaving the hotel at 6a for my flight so wasn't interested in food that early in the morning).  He offered to discount my room:  I told him my company is paying for my room; the issue is that my personal effects were managed without my permission.
So at c1:30a I entered the 'new' room and then had to wait for my luggage to be delivered to my room.

Not that it would have justified the action, but what was odd was that the room they moved me to was essentially the same as the original room --- so it's not as if the guest required a superior room that was unintentionally given to me.  On returning home, I had also leveled a note to Radisson via their Carlson Club website and have received no word of apology or other offer in return.  Needless to say, I am not a fan of this hotel and will not be staying there when I return.  My colleagues were equally shocked at my experience, so this location has lost two other future business travelers.  
The only reason I didn't make this one star is that the hotel itself is okay ---- it's clear that they are trying to bring some life back to a tired old building, but the structure itself is fairly comfortable.  Yet the service experience outweighed all other components of the stay.",2,2015,09,09
245,A very good airport hotel with a personal toiuch,"The welcome was like any good hotel (sometimes airport hotels can be off hand) and staff helpful. Rooms are good with all you need. Early morning call was automatic back up by a kind call from reception. Check out at 4:30 was slick.
Food OK but reasonably priced. Would use again when in Dublin.",4,2015,09,09
245,Travel Convenience,"There is no better place to stay for airport convenience.  Terminals are literally within walking distance, but take the free shuttle which runs every few minutes.  Rooms are comfortable, although they could use some new pillows and the electricity is a little funky.  Included is a breakfast buffet which is very good.  We didn't eat any other meals at the restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.",4,2015,09,08
245,Dreadful and over priced,"I stayed for one night in a business class room for €155. This is not four star. It is barely 2. The bathroom has black mould, loose and dirty fittings and had hairs in the bath. Almost all drawers were broken. Business class? Ordered apple juice for breakfast and received orange, ordered cornflakes and got weetabix.  Asked for a quiet room and got one closest to the road. Free WiFi did not work. I was asked how my stay was, I said not good, but there was no interest in why. So I told them. Largely ignored the feedback. I stayed here before and was happy but would have to be desperate to go back. For the price, it is scandalous.  Shame on you Radisson Blu. I did not get what I paid for.",1,2015,09,08
245,"I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, steer clear!!!","It is a nice hotel but the staff are awful. It is run with all foreign staff with not a Manager or Supervisor to be found. We stayed at this hotel on Friday night 04/09/15, we were leaving relatives down to catch a flight back to Canada on Saturday morning. We didn't arrive at the hotel until after 9, so after freshening up we decided to go and relax in the bar. The bar closed at 11.30 which was fine, we were told if we moved to the residents lounge that we would be attended to there. We asked one of the barmen to take an order but were told he would be back in 5/10 mins, after 30mins we asked at reception to send someone to us, again we were told 5/10mins, after a further 40mins i went to reception again, were the male receptionist followed me to our table and took our order. It took him maybe another 20mins before returning with the drinks which cost 37.50 euro for 5 of us. My partner gave him 50euro, and he said he'd return with the change but never did. The breakfast the next morning wasn't great. They had run out of most things by 10am and breakfast didn't finish until 11am. I couldn't get a fried egg although I asked two members of staff, the continental breakfast (meat & cheeses) the couple of slices that were left had all dried and curled up. We had paid for business class rooms and were entitled to complimentary bathrobes & slippers, we got one robe & one pair of slippers for two people per room. I am definitely not one to complain and never have before, I travelled down the east coast in June for 1wk and the west coast in July for 1wk staying in a different hotel every night and although maybe there was the odd hiccup most hotels were lovely and the staff really nice. This hotel and it's staff have a lot to be desired, I would lie on the street before ever staying here again.",1,2015,09,08
245,One night stay,It is very convinient for people travelling from Dublin Airport. Decent food and clean and quiet rooms with the view on the airport and planes. Liked the food in the bar although selection could be better,4,2015,09,08
245,"Good bed, but that's no good if you can't sleep","Stayed for just one night, before an early flight.  This hotel is very conveniently situated for the airport - they have a free shuttle, or you can walk to terminal 2 in about 5 minutes, and to terminal 1 in less than 10 minutes.  Good shower, and a very comfortable bed, but I did not get a good night's sleep, because of the ""fire door"" in the corridor, directly outside my room, which made loud noises (""de-de-de-de"" <pause> ""THUD"") every time it closed after someone walked through it, all night long - how are guests supposed to sleep?  I mentioned it at check out, and was offered €20 off the bill, but I'd much rather they committed to fixing the problem.  I'll stay somewhere else next time.",3,2015,09,06
245,This hotel needs to loose its Radisson accreditation,"We arrived at 1am, so we really just wanted a good sleep. As we entered the main corridors the carpets and walls were dirty, worn out and tired. The actual room was worse. Our bed was a small double fold out bed. It had such a bad mattress and springs that my wife actually slept part of the night on the floor! All the room furniture was chipped and worn out - needed replacing. 
We were on a no smoking floor. Our mini balcony was covered in cigarette butts. There was no bar fridge in the room. The breakfast was adequate.

This is the worst Radisson Blue we have ever encountered. It is a disgrace to the Radisson brand. After we complained that my wife slept part of the night on the floor they gave us a 20% discount. They should have given us our money back. The desk clerk was not surprised at our complaints.",1,2015,09,05
245,great staff,"you would have to go a long way to get better and more friendly staff, from the check in to the mini bus driver food was great value and the service by Robert L was the best, check in and the parking was so easy",5,2015,09,05
245,Very Dependable,"Nice location at the airport. You can actually wak from the terminal to the hotel if you like. Nice pub just off the Lobby inside the hotel. Staff was very helpful and are very professional. 

A very nice stay and a good fair price.",4,2015,09,03
245,Good airport hotel,"Visited location for a meeting, good facilities and then stayed overnight. Breakfast good value for money and will stay again nice and convenient location for the airport. Didn't have any food in the restaurant so unable to comment furthet",4,2015,09,02
245,Very good . . . again!!,"My family's return trip from France involved an overnight at Dublin and so we decided, once again, to avail ourselves of the Radisson Blu. I have reviewed this hotel very favourably in the past and will continue to do so as the standard remains high. The shuttle service to and from Terminal 2 is excellent and comfortable. The rooms are well equipped and offer all facilities required including the opportunity to make a cup of tea - always a bonus when arriving late at night. Dinner offers a good choice - Fillet Steak, Hake, Burgers, Fish and Chips etc., along with a varied selection of starters and desserts. Breakfast - the usual buffet style - is wide-ranging and enjoyable. Finally the staff, from the front desk to room maids, are most helpful and friendly and the free wi-fi is a bonus. A stay at the Radisson definitely makes the nuisance of an overnight a lot more pleasant.",5,2015,09,02
245,Disappointing stay,"Stayed here for one night on a business trip and I was disappointed. I have stayed in a number of Radisson Blu hotels and find them to be modern, clean with a very high level of service. I found this hotel to be the opposite, it was tired and really needs a lick of paint and new carpet. The shower screen didn't have any edging on which meant that all the water came straight through the gap between the glass and the bath leading to a very wet floor. I also left my room service breakfast order on the door at 8pm and found out when it didn't arrive in the morning that it was still hanging on the door. Not sure I'd stay again I expect more from the Radisson Blu brand.",2,2015,09,01
245,Tired old '90s timewarp ,"There is only 1 reason to stay here: being able to walk to the airport. Parking costs extra, the rooms are tired and dated, the bed has this ridiculous wooden structure around it, the carpets and chairs are stained.
Positives: efficient check in/out and grab n go breakfast in reception.

Do yourself a favour and stay in the Carlton or Crowne Plaza instead.",2,2015,08,31
245,Book a Business Class Room if You Want to be Cool,"After reading the poor TripAdvisor reviews, I was bracing myself for a less than premium experience.

While the soft furnishings at this hotel have taken quite a beating, I thought the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.

I would caution everyone that if you are booking during the warm months, only the Business Class rooms offer A/C.  Fans can be requested for the standard rooms.

While the property is in theory walkable from T1, late at night, I picked up the free hotel shuttle bus.

My Business class room strangely only contained a queen-sized bed, office table & chair  – and a large empty space at the end of the room where a coach / sofa should have been placed.

The bar was very lively – I didn’t eat, but I did order a slightly over-priced Irish coffee.

I didn’t eat breakfast at the hotel, as it was not included in my rate, but I was offered a reduced price of 12 Euros if I booked it when I checked in.

Make sure you that request that they charge you in Euros not pounds – otherwise you will get a poorer exchange rate.  They also put a 50 Euro hold for a few days on your account for extras (which annoyed me a little) and they *still* charged me in pounds (sigh).

With the window closed, I slept soundly.  Shower was fine if a little shabby.  Bed was comfortable and the location to the airport is very convenient.

Not a jewel in the crown of the Radisson chain, but it did the job.",3,2015,08,31
245,Nice stay,"Stayed at this hotel the night before our departure. Nice furnished room. Located with a 8 minute walk from Terminal 1. 
We ordered the rom service as it offered a reasonably priced dinner that included a starter, main and dessert.",4,2015,08,30
245,Dirty and worn,"I suppose the plan is to tear down this building. I spend 30 to 40 nights a year at a hotel and this is the filthiest 4-star hotel I've ever seen. The carpets in the hallway tell the story. The place needs new paint. The windows were dirty. The sheets were placed on the bed haphazardly. The bathroom was tiny by Irish standards. The second set of towels were hidden on the top shelf of the wardrobe. I was told this after I called to ask for more towels and the operator told me where to hunt. The ""mini bar"" is an empty refrigerator with a note to call room service It is close enough to the airport to walk, but there are other close hotels to choose from. ",1,2015,08,30
245,Good place to stay when using Dublin AP,"stayed here after a late arrival at Dublin AP.
Hotel is walking distance (about 10 min), entirely via a footpath for pedestrians.

The hotel is nice and quite. Restaurant is a good place to eat, great selection of fine burgers and other dishes.

Breakfast is well prepared and extensive choice is available.",3,2015,08,29
245,Most Convenient Access to Dublin Airpport,"We stayed here on our last night in Ireland for the convenience of getting to the airport for an early morning flight.  The airport is probably a 5-7 minute walk or a quick shuttle to the airport check-in area.  Even with noisy air traffic on the outside, we found the inside to be comfortable and quiet.",4,2015,08,28
245,Relaxing overnight stay before flying out,"While the hotel itself seemed a little worn, like the Velveteen Rabbit, the staff was incredibly polite and helpful from start to finish.  The room was large, clean, and comfortable.  The design of the room had many details to maximize the usefulness of the appointments.  I ordered room service, and was delighted by the quick delivery and DELICIOUS food!  We enjoyed that meal very much.  We also slept soundly in the cozy king-size bed.  I personally loved that the shower/bath had a swing out glass panel, but my husband was not pleased by how low the shower head was.  He could have used the hand-held option, but he was highly irritated that the actual shower head was positioned for people under 6 feet tall.  That was the only real complaint, but it was enough to make him not want to stay there again.  I, on the other hand, really enjoyed staying there.  And I LOVED the bog oak sculpture in the entryway -- lovely Irish touch!  We only waited about 5 minutes for the courtesy coach to the airport the next morning.  The driver was very nice and loaded and unloaded our bags for us.",4,2015,08,27
245,A nice end to our journey,"Easy check in- always greeted with a smile and willingness to help. The room was a wow! crisp sheets, clean toilet, great amenities, and fine food at the restaurant! The breakfast in the morning was also superb! The airport terminal was a very quick 5 minutes from the hotel was great bag service from the valet. Great stay!",4,2015,08,25
245,Great hotel for an early morning flight,"When we have an early morning flight we like staying at the Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport. It is a 2 minute shuttle ride or a 5 minute walk to the terminal. The staff are very welcoming. The rooms are modern, clean, spacious,have fast wifi and coffee/tea making facilities. The queen bed is a 'true' queenn with a single unit and is extremely comfortable mattress, not 2 singles pushed together with a gap in the middle. The restaurant is ok, not gourmet but meets our needs, it does close rather early (around 10pm). We always get a good nights sleep and have no stress getting to the airport for an early departure. As an overnight stay with convenient connection to the terminals we would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,08,23
245,Mediocre but dated hotel convenient for Dublin Airport,"I stayed at this hotel in the night preceding an early flight from Dublin airport.  The hotel itself is very convenient for the airport, taking me about ten minutes to walk to the hotel from Terminal 1, whilst the free shuttlebus was convenient and took about half the time. 

The hotel itself though has seen better days - although I was upgraded to a larger room (and it was indeed very large), it was dated and seemed to be in various shades of beige, whilst in the bathroom sealant was coming away from the (beige) bathroom tiles. The room was also hot or, with the window open, noisy.  

The service at the hotel was mediocre. The staff on duty were very friendly, but it took me at least ten minutes to speak to a member of staff in order to check in. Given I was the second in the queue, this was very slow indeed.  

Overall, the hotel is convenient for the airport (and that's its main purpose), but don't expect stellar service or contemporary style.",3,2015,08,23
245,Tererible Service Average Food,"I stayed at this hotel with my family on the night of August 21st, the food on the ""main menu"" was average, the service was poor primarily due to a shortage of experienced staff, several requests for table water were ignored, the food order was messed up with some ingredients not supplied, there was no security present to manage a potentially explosive situation which was fuelled by troublemakers who were continually served alcohol culminating in an all out brawl in the bar resulting in eleven garda cars attending the scene, children unable to sleep due to the brawl going on and a lack of management by the hotel. No apology was given for our ruined stay except for ""what can we do?"" I will never ever stay in this hotel again, outward appearances are misleading. Breakfast was very poor, no hot plates for ""hot"" food, one attendant on duty purely to cross off guests room numbers. Terrible service, poor quality food, poorly trained staff absolutely awful customer service.",1,2015,08,23
245,one night stay,"Stayed one night here before our flight. It wasn't worth money. We had an old room, very small. We had 2 single beds and a pill out couch. In order to move in room only one person could stand at one time. The hallway rugs were filthy. They charged 1 euro to weigh each bag in lobby and the scale turns off before you can take anything out of your bag. Isnt that the reason someone wants to weigh a bag?? we ordered soup in restaurant and we couldn't eat it. It was full of pepper. (like they spilled the bottle in it)",2,2015,08,22
245,average,"Booked via hotels.ie and was supposed to get a business class room which was ""not ready"" at 17:30 so got a standard room (no price difference though). Hmmm. This property is poorly built, has a lot of small flaws, room had shabby bits from poor materials or poor finish to the build. The car park was large (costs extra) and had plenty of free spaces. I did not use the free wifi.
Sound insulation in the bedroom was average so airport noise was audible in the room, solved by earplugs.
I had a room on the second floor that was a bit the worse for wear.
Bathroom had moldy tiling (no extractor fan, strangely), water from shower went on the floor easily, and needs a refurb. Ironing table was very worn. Trouser-press had a sharp spike exactly on a place to rip your trousers if you were not observant. The steam iron worked well. TV channels average but all worked properly. There was a coffee machine in the room, nespresso style which I did not use.
The bed was comfortable, although pillows were a bit hard and small.
Breakfast was a bit boring and starts at 06:30 which might not be early enough for some people, things did not taste right somehow. It was all the little things that were wrong, as if someone had forgotten the details.
Although there is a free courtesy bus to Terminal-2 and Terminal-1, it  was faster to walk from Terminal-2 in good weather with little luggage. Checkin and checkout was fast and efficient. 
All the staff I encountered were non-Irish except for the barman, and were professional and helpful.
Public areas were OK, and the bar staff were efficient. I did not eat dinner at the restaurant so have no opinion about that. 
All in, I think this was overpriced for what I got, much prefer the central Dublin Radisson-Blu property on Golden Lane, and I won't stay at the airport location again unless I have no choice.",3,2015,08,20
245,Surprised!,Booked a junior suite to stay in ahead of an early morning flight. Room was great! Floor to ceiling windows with views of terminal 2 at the airport. Normally I don't have a good experience eating at hotels but the bar food was excellent! Surprisingly excellent! Irish mixed board for starter and fillet steak cooked to perfection for main and from my experience it was as good as many restaurants I have eaten in. It's definitely better than the other Dublin Airport hotels I have stayed at and I'll be back.,5,2015,08,19
245,"Affordable, quiet, very close to airport","We chose this hotel due to airport proximity. While there is a hotel shuttle which is free, you can also walk from the terminals to the hotel in 15 minutes. 

Rooms were comfortable and clean. The hotel bar was busy and had great beers on tap.

The restaurant was slow. Food was ok. You're really eating there for convenience sake.

Wifi worked in the rooms, as promised.

It would have been more fun to stay in temple bar, but you can taxi there in about 20 minutes. 

Overall, ok, not awesome.",3,2015,08,18
245,Convenient for airport,"Stayed 1 night before flight next morning.  Check in was quick, staff helpful.  Room was fine, double bed, small bathroom.  Dinner was nice as was the service.  All in all a good place to stay near the airport and reasonably priced.",4,2015,08,18
245,No room service,"Stayed in business class room for one night. Arrived after midnight. Got in the room. Phoned for room service. They said they would call back. That was over 47 minutes ago. Someone dropped the ball here and I'll be dammed if I am paying many many pounds to pick it up for them. Sorry guys you just lost my vote, was looking forward to a Guinness nightcap. This never happens in the states somehow.",1,2015,08,17
245,"Dingy hotel, tacky reception and a mix up with room keys","Got there late close to midnight to a queue at reception. Three people on the desk, one just looking on, one seemed efficient and the third slow as christmas and incapable. Suffice to say we had a major snaffu which I spoke to management about the following morning, I will not go into this as I assume like they promised it has been taken care of.
It is shabby no recognition of club Carlson status and no coverage from the rain while going to the airport bus unlike before the refurb. Breakfast followed the general theme but the staff were friendly. I was just glad it was a quick stay.",1,2015,08,17
245,"Perfect Location, showing its age","Location is all for an airport hotel, and the Radisson does delivery that perfectly. Its so close to the Terminal 1 and 2 that one can easly walk – if there would be a sign. Waiting time for the courtesy shuttle after 11 pm was a bit longer then expected (there is a phone to call at the arrival hall „courtesy hotel“) and not all passenger got in at the first time. 
Business class room was extremly spacy with a nice desk, lots of plugs and comfy bathrobs and a nespresso machine and extra kettle. 
Sadly the bathrooms are showing the age of the hotel and could use a refurbishment, but still perfectly for a one night stay. Big plus for the hairdry not fix plugged in at the bathroom.
Breakfast should be avoid, since the coffee wasn’t the best (Cappuccino a normal coffee with milk foam)  and a small choise regards cerals, fresh fruits, cold cuts & cheese.",3,2015,08,16
245,Average room stay,"We stayed one night here before our flight out the next day. The shuttle service was quick and friendly. Check in and out was friendly as well. The room is just an average room with a double bed. The bathroom is very very small. Overall clean hotel and convenient to the airport only, otherwise would have to take a 15-20 minute drive to center of Dublin. The price is good for the stay.",3,2015,08,15
245,Good place to start holiday,"Stayed in the hotel the night before we went on holiday.
Check-in really good with very friendly staff who made you feel welcome, nice for a large hotel.
We upgraded to a business Class room which was worth it, really spacious and very clean.
This also gave us breakfast in our room which gave us more time as we would have been rushing the next morning as the restaurant didn't open until 6 ish.
Really enjoyed my stay and good start to holiday.",4,2015,08,14
245,Amazing,We stayed her last week in a suite after being told that our room had been sold in the maldron. Wow the greeting we got was amazing and staff could not do enough. After a 20 hour journey from our honeymoon we decided to stay in dublin to get some sleep before our onward journey home the next day. Thank god we ended up here. First class. Will be back,5,2015,08,11
245,Very Good,"The guys on reception were in a charitable mood immediately offered us an upgrade as they weren’t very busy GETTIN!....... Attractive bar, charming     people and a great example of a one night airport stopover.",4,2015,08,10
245,It do the job for stay and fly one night.,"Hotel was nice and clean, Rooms was big enough, good for claustrophobic people. Clean bathroom. It do the job for stay And Fly. Very close to T2 even don't need to take a transport because you will be there before him. 
Only small Issues bed was not great and the windows need to be resealed because you just hear all traffic from outside the hotel.",3,2015,08,10
245,Business Stay,All the comforts and customer service you would expect from a global hotel chain. Always happy to stay here as convenient for onward travel and excellent staff who are always happy to help. Good menu selection with service to match.,5,2015,08,09
245,"Good, efficient, comfortable ","Stayed here the night before an early morning flight. Bedroom was good sized and comfortable! Bed was very comfortable. Slept really well in spite of proximity to airport.

Went into the bar for one drink. Was very busy, but service and efficient!

Shuttle bus to the airport was really airport. No waiting, bus comes on demand. Takes stress out of travelling! ",4,2015,08,07
245,Disappointing,"I booked a single room without breakfast in advance on 19th March 2015 for one night (25th July 2015). Hotel staff anticipated that the hotel would be busy on this night and told me the cost of the room would be €199. I agreed to this price. When I arrived at the hotel, I was quickly served by a courteous receptionist and told I could avail of one free service (e.g. free desert, free item of room service). I agreed to this. The bedroom looked sparsely furnished and not very nicely presented. My bed was a pull down bed, not a proper hotel bed. There was no other bed in the room. Its legs came out over the width of the mattress and at one stage I nearly tripped on the leg. The lights beside the bed were inside alcoves (similar to wardrobes without the doors). They were useless for reading and awkward to reach. The TV remote did not work and after three visits from hotel staff, I was given a remote that worked. Bathroom was very clean. Hotel staff were very helpful. Bedroom was of poor quality for price.",3,2015,08,06
245,Disappointing,"Uncomfortable bed, hard pillows, and failure to provide promised amenities (complimentary newspaper, mineral water, and a stocked mini bar).  Great location near the airport but poor value for the money I paid.",3,2015,08,04
245,Dated,I was excited to hear I was checked into a Radisson Blu unfortunately I was gravely disappointed it was extremely dated slow and cold.  I have stayed in other hotels and had a lovely experience.  While the food was good and reasonable the welcoming was the downfall.,3,2015,08,04
245,Radisson,Very good hotel overall and nice restaurant. I would prefer no carpets in bedrooms as carpets hold dust and are never as clean as wooden floors. The bedrooms though are larger than usual and the first floor one was very airy and pleasant.,4,2015,08,03
245,Unmitagated Disaster,This hotel could not even provide me with a room that locked for my first two and a half hours.  I discovered this immediately and then called down to let them know.  They said they'd send somebody right up and a half an hour later I went down to the front desk to see what was going on.    The guy went up with me and tried to fix it.  He could not and went back down to continue to work on it.  A little later he came by and still could not fix it.  He said he would be back.  I then went down to ask for a new room and was told that the hotel was completely full and I could not get a new room.  Finally 2 and a half hours after this ordeal started I got a new room.  Both rooms I was in had stains on each of the three chairs.  One of them literally look like someone had pissed on it from the location of the stain right in the middle.  There was a room service debacle complete with the wrong amount on the bill among many other things.  This hotel is just terrible and the worst I have stayed at in my entire life.,1,2015,08,03
245,great to sleep before an early flight,"Perfect hotel to spend a night before an early flight or a late arrival. Quiet rooms even if in front of airport.
Even early you can grab a coffee / apple and get a transfer lift to the terminal.

Car park is cheaper than airport car park too",3,2015,08,02
245,Very friendly hotel,"I have been visiting Dublin for many years now and have stayed at lots of different hotels all over the area. I found this hotel to have the nicest atmosphere of all of the places that I've stayed. The staff were all very helpful and friendly.

As a business traveller, I was also delighted with the fact that there was a full desk in the room (separate to where the telly is), plenty of power points and even a fridge.

I will definitely be using this hotel again, I would highly recommend it.",5,2015,08,02
245,Overnight layover at a convenient airport hotel,"I was arriving at Dublin airport for a layover of less than 24 hours, and landing after 8pm. So I didn't want to travel too far for a hotel room. Looking in advance of my trip I noted there were only two hotels that could realistically claim to be at the airport. I choose the Radisson Blu as on the date I stayed, at the time I booked it just happened to be cheaper. I am not a member of the chains loyalty programme.

My flight eventually landed just before 9pm at terminal 1 and I was out of the airport by 9:20pm. On exiting the terminal I saw the stand for the hotel shuttle to my left. But I wanted to walk to see if the hotel really was 'at the airport'. I should clarify I have never been to Dublin airport either!

Firstly the hotel is not signposted, but having looked on google maps before my journey I roughly knew that I had to turn right out of the terminal, past terminal two and the hotel should be across the road. Was it? Well yes it was but due to my lack of direction I took a few extra footpaths. But I was at the hotel within 10-15 minutes, it was a slight downhill walk. All paved footpaths with plenty of pedestrian crossing points.

Maybe due to the time of night there was no queue at check-in. The receptionist was on the phone but another member of staff quickly came out of the back office and checked me in. My credit card was asked for, for a 'pre authorisation', which turned out to be €250. Just in case I did a runner the next day after I suppose! I was advised about the hotel restaurant and how to connect to the Wi-if.

I was in room 234 a business class room. Firstly I spent several minutes trying to find the air con. There was none, you had to open the window, I was looking out over the car park, a four lane road and the airport it was noisy, but due to the time the traffic soon subsided after the last flights had been/gone from the airport. The room was large, had a desk with a capsule coffee machine, coffee table, large sideboards for bags, wardrobe, etc. the minibar was empty, to get it filled you called room service. I found the bed to be very comfy and I had a good night sleep. There were plenty of wall sockets for electronics. Good selection of Irish and UK TV channels. Almost no noise from the corridor, but this was a Friday night on the business floor so maybe this is why. I found the room to be very clean, at least to my eyes.

My OCD kicked in when I pressed the four light switches, but one switch did not seem to turn anything on or off! All the lights were working though, very curious! The bathroom was large with a bath/shower. Well lit with shaving sockets on the wall. The toilet was at a strange angle and, to be blunt if you were sitting on the toilet and had long legs your knees may be touching the wall in front! It also never flushed on the first press of the handle, it always took two or so goes pressing the handle to flush.

Wi-if, was free and handled playing video, uploading photos and general web browsing. It took a while for the log in page to appear on my devices when I selected the hotels wi-fi signal but we got there in the end. There appeared to be no device limit, and I connected my iPad and two phones. You only had to connect once, as when you wake the device up from sleep it connected straight away to the wi-fi again.

Check out was at midday, I left at 1145am. I hadn't paid for the room in advance. So I paid for the room and was given a receipt. I was informed about the hotel shuttle. When I said I was going to walk, I was told to use the pedestrian crossings due to traffic. Check out was quick and pleasant.

Now it was daylight I found the more direct path to the terminal and I was there in under ten minutes!",4,2015,08,01
245,"It's a decent enough airport hotel, that's it..",I stayed with my family before we took a flight to the U.S. The hotel is nice enough and it is close to the Airport unlike some of the other Airport Hotels... Our view of the open bins gently decomposing was a low point but generally the place is fine for a one night stay.,3,2015,08,01
245,Late arriving and early departing,"A very prompt bus shuttle helped make this visit 
The hotel check in was a little chaotic but friendly. I opted for a business class room which I found comfortable. A very early start saw me use the excellent shuttle bus, and took away the stress",4,2015,07,30
245,Depressing and Dingy,The good news is that it is near to the airport. In fact you can walk there which is a good thing as the promised shuttle rarely materialises when you need it. The staff are also nice enough but dont seem to want to be there. And neither do the customers. It has the feeling of a motorway service station at 1am. The rooms are tatty and need refurbishments. The bedding doesnt fit the beds (a first from a hotel). The air conditioning doesnt work and the bathrooms needs serious work (the tap came off in my hand). If I wasn't in such a rush in the morning I would have invoked their 100 percent satifaction guarantee and got my money back.,2,2015,07,30
245,Efficient and Convenient,Very convenient to airport. Friendly staff and efficient check-in. Bar food is of a good standard at a reasonable price. Rooms were clean and bright. Would stay again when in need of airport stop-over. Breakfast was good with a variety of options.,4,2015,07,30
245,Handy spot for the airport,"Clean, convenient hotel with friendly helpful staff. Not noisy even though next to the airport. I was disappointed by the car park charges, as I had not been advised  of these beforehand and due to the location of the hotel, there was no alternative. I would stay again, and in fact have booked to do this but will dine elsewhere. The evening meal was poor, burned chicken and sediment in the wine. The meal was overpriced for the quality. The dining room staff were helpful though.",4,2015,07,29
245,Average but convenient location,"Hotel location is perfect for early morning flights, free shuttle to airport every 15 minutes. Drivers great.  Hotel breakfast IS NOT INCLUDED with your stay, was not appropriately advised of this fact. Actually it was the first accommodations on visit that breakfast wasn't included.  Room was efficient. Expect to wait for service in dining room for the evening meal. Apparently was so busy there was not enough staff to meet demand.  I would rather stay somewhere else where service is more of a focus rather than volume.",3,2015,07,29
245,"No better than average, and possibly below for a 4-star hotel","We only had an overnight stay here before flying off on holiday, but it was enough time to gather that the hotel fails to rise above average in any aspects.

Check in was with a slightly surly receptionist, so it wasn't a good start. The room was ok but really nothing special, and the restaurant food was poor and overpriced - I've written a separate review for the restaurant.

If your main requirement is to be within a few minutes of the airport terminals, then this hotel might be a good option for you - just don't expect anything particularly special. 

I have stayed in three star Radisson hotels in Ireland which provided much more pleasant service, a better quality restaurant, and more pleasant staff than this one, so it is hard to see how this hotel qualifies for its four star grading.",3,2015,07,28
245,Ireland and Italy touring Vacation,We reserved two rooms at the Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport well in advance for a one night stay prior to catching flights the next day. This is positively one of the worst hotels we've ever stayed at. I would expect much more in terms of service and accommodations from a hotel charging € 200 plus per night. Registration had reversed our room arrangements and we had to rearrange our luggage on our own. The toilet in one of the rooms was inoperable. It took two requests of the maintenance staff to attempt repairs and it still didn't work properly. The rooms were overlooking the trash disposal area with noisy wagons rolling refuse around throughout the entire night. Restaurant was very expensive and mediocre at best. Will not stay here or at any other Radisson property again. Completely unsatisfactory.,1,2015,07,28
245,Overnight stay for early flight,"Not impressed with any aspect of the hotel service. Paid for a Business class room - no mineral water in the room as per the reservation. Only one set of towels and bathrobe left in room; even though the reservation shows the room was booked for 2 people. The airline check-in facility provided in reception did not work. I wasted 15 minutes trying to get it working .... having been told by the reception staff that it was a bit slow !!! Eventually had to get them to print the boarding passes off ... Then they printed 2 copies off ... so their computer was set up incorrectly as well!
The restaurant was no better.  Waited 20 mins for our order to be taken - which was only half filled. It then took a further 30 minutes before we got our food; after asking a staff member why it was taking so long. I did not appreciate the curt answer to my question.
Breakfast , the next morning, was another farce and on asking to speak to a duty manager (around 6.30am) I was told there would not be one on until 7.30am. The whole experience has left me unable to recommend this hotel for anything other than its location.",2,2015,07,26
245,"Closest to terminal, good food, poor amenities for the price","With Radisson on a mission to upgrade the image of its brand, I had higher expectations of what turned out to be an average minus airport hotel experience. Pluses: friendly greeting and helpful front desk staff, good quality breakfast; reasonable menu, presentation and quality of food in pub.  Minuses: no on-property gym, wifi that slows to crawl in evening with no option to buy higher bandwidth, dark lobby and rooms nearing end of reno life (but clean, quiet and well lit).  Not a €212 ""experience"" by any measure - and probably best considered a second-choice as soon as the next new hotel brand comes to the Dublin airport area.",3,2015,07,25
245,Practical Choice if you Need to Be 2 Min away from Airport in Dublin,"This is a functional, no frills, business traveler hotel designed for those that need to be almost at the airport.  Rooms are clean with bath robes and slippers.  Staff made up mostly of East Eauropeans is friendly.  Other than the WiFi things generally seem to work in a utilitarian sort of way, and ironically better and faster than some of the R&C old european hotels that boast to be 5 star, but are really 2 star with 4 star service.  Those that have stayed at these smaller properties, paying 400 to 800 euros per night know eactly what I am talking about.  Not to digress, though, at 150 euros, this Radisson delivers.  It also has a 24 hour -every 10 min on the clock airport shuttle that is free.",4,2015,07,25
245,Review of overnight stay in Radisson Blu,Our stay was a happy & relaxing experience. Staff were efficient & pleasant. Bed was very comfortable.  Room & bathroom were clean. Decor was pleasing. Food in evening & morning was good & well presented. Very close proximity to airport.,5,2015,07,24
245,Well located airport hotel but needs a revamp,"Airport hotels need two things, good connections to the airport and a good place to stay. This hotel has a shuttle bus every 15 minutes 24 hours a day, so this is sorted. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The bar has good bar food, like burgers and cold beer. The rooms are basic, but the bed was comfortable and the shower was good. 

However, the hotel is rather run down and needs a complete repainting for most public areas. The elevators basically need replacing; in fact one was already not working. I am in the business and I know a life expired elevator when I see it. 

It is an airport hotel so there is nothing much in the local area. So, good airport hotel but needs a revamp.",4,2015,07,24
245,Compares poor to other Radisson hotels - but good enough for one night,"Instead of the 24-shuttle I decided to walk to the hotel, which was little confusing considering there were no signs or directions from the airport terminal. It tool about 15-20 minutes before I reached the hotel, after crossing a very busy road with no pedestrian crossing.

The room was spacious, but the furniture looked worn, marked and knocked with scars from previous guests. Stylish it was not, and could use some updating. There was no in-room safe, no mini-bar or fridge in the room. Rather basic for a hotel of this class.

Radisson BLU Hotel Dublin Airport did not match standards of other Radisson Hotels I’ve stayed at in.

Nearby there is a 24-hour McDonalds and service station that sells fast food and drinks. 

It was just a night here to catch an early flight, but there was little that impressed me about the the Radisson BLU Hotel Dublin Airport other than the location and convenience, and the staff were very friendly.",3,2015,07,22
245,Passing through,"Great location for quick access to the airport.  This Radisson was very clean, quiet, and modern.  It has air conditioning.  Has a shuttle that runs 24 hours a day to and from the Dublin airport.  Dublin Terminal 2 has pre-check for the US.",4,2015,07,22
245,Fantastic,I stayed in a business suite for one night before a flight early the next morning. The room was spacious and clean. There was complimentary use of the Nespresso machine which was a nice treat. Breakfast was also pleasing with a wide range of food. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2015,07,22
245,Reasonable value better than expected,"After reading some of the reviews on here, I was concerned about what to expect. Needless to say the hotel was fine. Stayed in a business class room, nice amount of room with a sofa too, clean and nice comfy bed. Perhaps one or two light fittings needed a little bit of maintenance i.e. shades a bit awry which might annoy some people but air conditioning fine and of course with a fresh breeze always opening the window a touch helps too. Reasonable breakfast which had a good choice in a quiet atmosphere. Very close to the airport terminals can be walked unless you have heavy luggage and they do provide a shuttle service running regularly. Room rate very good compared with city prices a good 200 euros cheaper for two days stay. Bus 747 into city only 10 euros return. All in all a very nice stay worth it for money saved on the hotel.",4,2015,07,22
245,Room Was An Uncomfortable Sweatbox,"Pros: Convenient location inside Dublin Airport

Cons: Stayed in Room 242 prior to an early morning flight in July 2015.  The room had no apparent temperature control.  We were unable to open the window.  The room was hot.  The blanket on the bed was a down comforter.  We sweated and had difficulty sleeping.  I'm not sure if absence of temperature control in the room is pervasive throughout this hotel, or whether this was simply a careless oversight in my particular room.  Nonetheless an unpleasant experience.  Hotel was fine, otherwise.",2,2015,07,21
245,"Come on Radisson ,get it together !!!!","After a long flight with my partner and 5 year old son ,we checked in after midnight .
We had alot of luggage and and there was no help with transporting this to our room.
When we reached the room there was one double bed and a bed settee which was not made up.
I contacted reception and was told we would be transferred to another room , 5 minutes later i received a call to say someone would instead make up the bed settee.A few minutes passed and a member of staff arrived at the door with a single bed and no sheets .i told him we didn't need another bed but to make up the bed settee, off he went to get sheets. After another 10 minutes he arrived back and seemed to have trouble setting up the bed settee.
I was getting rather irate by this stage a my young son was exhausted so phoned and complained to the duty manager who suddenly seemed to find a spare room.
Finally ,after an hour  of Fawlty Towers ineptitude we managed to get to bed.
I spoke with the duty manager next morning who apologised and refunded 30 euro off the room rate ,i requested that someone from management would phone me as i really expected much better service from a brand such a Radisson, still waiting !!!!!!.
I do travel regularly and research where i spend my hard earned and i would struggle to recommend this hotel to anyone.",2,2015,07,21
245,Top Tier for Airport Hotels,"My family and I stayed here before an early morning flight to Paris. Though we arrived late at night, they still delivered extra bedding efficiently. The window was huge–it took up a whole wall–and, as my dad said, ""That's a pretty great view for an airport!"" I think that statement sums up the entire experience: much nicer that easily expected by a usual establishment of the sort. Also, though we left the hotel at 4:00 the next morning, fruit, water, coffee, and breakfast bars were set out as we left. I would certainly stay here again!",5,2015,07,20

245,Dublin airport Radisson,"Extremely convenient and great staff - shuttle to Dublin airport is very efficient.   Rooms are modern and well kept.    Wireless signal strength could be improved.   You do pay for the location and depending upon the weather, and need to have windows open - you may have some jet noise to deal with.

245,"Pleasant staff, really awful room considering almost €150","Had an overnight stay before an early morning flight to the States. 

Arrived late, around 11.30pm. Check in staff were very busy but also very pleasant. 

Went to our room to find it only had a narrow foldaway ""murphy"" bed that folded up into the wall. Not what I'd call a proper bed for €142

Also the two chairs in the room were disgustingly stained. 

We asked to move but they said they couldn't. They knocked €30 off the bill which was something but still this was a very unpleasant experience. 

Two stars is for the beleaguered but pleasant front desk night staff but zero for the room. 

Would most definitely not stay here again or recommend to friends, family or work colleagues. 

I'd also say that if you have suitcases this hotel is on the limit of being walkable from the terminal. Certainly wouldn't want to do it in bad weather. (We arrived late and the shuttle had stopped running: they said they'd get it out for us but it would be 20 minutes so we just hopped in scab, which was €7).

Fitness facility absolutely bad , are outside the hotel in another building ! 

Room and bathroom are little bit old!",3,2015,07,18
245,Below expectations,"My experience from beginning to end was quite mediocre. Arriving early (well before the standard checkin time) I was advised the room wasn't yet available, but that they would help expedite the preparation. No problem at all, as I was returning my rental vehicle. Upon my return, only 5 minutes prior to the checkin time, I was told it still wasn't available. Being a Radisson Concierge member (their platinum equivalent), I would have expected more. It took 40 further minutes until the room was ready! A drink and dessert voucher doesn't really compensate... No upgrade to next category was offered, nor mentioned - and when asked they said the hotel was full (not correct as I had called the hotel anonymously while I dropped the rental car!). 

This property is in need of investment throughout the hotel. The room felt old and weary, however the bathroom had received a welcomed makeover. The bar/restaurant area was like an office cafeteria with a bar thrown in for good measure. The breakfast restaurant was even worse, with a very average selection of food. Staffing overall was adequate, but it didn't appear as though they wanted to be there...

In all, rather disappointing. There are many options around the airport. Do as I will next time, even though I'm a Radisson Concierge member, and stay somewhere else...",2,2015,07,18
245,Virtual disaster,"My excellent travel agent made a one-night res for me and my family to end our visit on the last night in preparation for a flight back to the USA at this property.  We requested a king bed and rollaway and frankly paid what seems to comparatively be a very high price for the rservation.  When we got there, there was a queen bed with a pullout sofa double, but no rollaway.  When we requested one, we got a single mattress laid down onto the floor onto a small pad, the footprint of which was considerably smaller than the mattress size [!], allowing the head, foot and sides of the mattress to flop down directly onto the floor [try getting up from floor level with the edges of the mattress lower than the center: bizarre experience!].  So now here we are with inadequate sleeping arrangements despite paying a premium price.  The response from the front desk management:  we don't have king beds [despite my travel agency's confirmation to me of this], and you have all the bedding we have, no possibility of accommodating the family [i.e. which I took to be a nice Irish way of saying ""take it or leave it, we are not doing anything for you""].  In addition, somehow my Carlson Club membership number did not get attached to the res, and I was not carrying the card.  The front desk here again was totally unhelpful, indicating alternatives such as: a) call corporate when you get back for a retroactive posting for the points; or b) look up your number on line [which of course without the number you can't do] and essentially:  we are not going to do anything for you on this either.  [ps:  I have loyalty accounts with numerous of their competitors and each and every one has been always helpful and ready to add the account number at the time of check in whenever I don't have those pesky i.d. cards with me].  Anything good I can say about my experience there:  well I did get an apology by phone after I did try to call corporate when back in the US, but actually my call prompted a complaint by corporate to the property and it was evident that management was responding not to my actual inconvenience and disappointment, but to a probe by corporate into how a loyalty customer could have been so shabbily treated, so the point of their call was more to cover their own behind than to really care about the customer.  I indicated that the effort they went to after the fact would have been much more appropriate having been expended when I was right there on site with 2 actual needs that needed to be addressed.  I would not only never stay there again [or likely at any other of their sister properties] but surely would not at all recommend that anyone do so either.  When there are so many decent choices, why go with one that neither trains its staff adequately nor actually cares about the customers' needs.  [ps.  this was unique in my overall wonderful experience staying all over Ireland, as every single other experience was top notch, just not this one, and this is not at all representative of the treatment tourists get in Ireland according to my observations.]",1,2015,07,17
245,Surprisingly pleasant stay,"This hotel is the perfect place to stay for a morning flight home.  It is clean, modern and yes - quiet.  The food was excellent, though it would help to have breakfast available earlier.  The staff was most helpful, especially in giving us advice about rental car return.  The airport shuttle really makes quick trips.",4,2015,07,15
245,In Transit,"Stayed here for one night in transit. It was ok, did the job. Free wifi was great. I had a 'business class' room but not sure what that meant? It was close to the airport. Hotel/Airport shuttle was supposed to run every 15 mins but it was quite sporadic (driver from another hotel actually picked me up and dropped me off once to save me waiting). About half an hour away from the city, but just caught the €6 Airlink bus into the city to spend the day. Overall nothing fantastic but served its purpose.",3,2015,07,14
245,Very convenient and comfortable hotel,"I only visited the hotel for a one-day conference and its location is superb.

There is a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel that runs every 15-20mins and this makes it an excellent choice for an overnight stay or even to spend a few hours in between flights.",4,2015,07,13
245,Last night in Ireland,"We stayed at this hotel because it was so close to the airport.  Very different from our other hotel experiences.  The staff were nice but very professional, not personable.  There are no king size beds in the hotel.  Hotel was clean.  Sandwiches for lunch were edible but nothing special.  Good hotel to be close to the airport.",3,2015,07,12
245,Good for overnight stay before flight,"Stayed in this hotel a couple of weeks ago and despite some awful reviews we found it to be fine.  We had a very nice meal in the bar and a lot of people were eating there and their meals looked great as well.  Staff very friendly and helpful and we ordered continental breakfast in our room for 6-00am and it came at exactly that time and it was delicious, very tasty indeed.  We were in a business class room and bed was very comfortable and room clean.  The shuttle bus dropped me off at the correct terminal, for reviews saying they were at wrong place if they told the driver the terminal they require I'm sure it would have been fine.  I would stay here again if flying from Dublin airport.",4,2015,07,12
245,Still as good as ever,"My wife and I regularly stay in this hotel if we have an early flight out of Dublin. The room was large and well-equipped with a good fridge and a trouser press and a separate work area. The bathroom was a reasonable size. The king-sized bed was very comfortable with a great quilt - we were too warm. 
The rooms have been updated since our last stay with a Nespresso coffee machine - a nice touch!!.
The early morning wake-up call was done by a person at exactly the correct time - not by an automated machine!
Again, I have no hesitation recommending this hotel.",4,2015,07,11
245,Rundown airport hotel,"Rooms are ok. The hotel is showing its age and wear. But don't so many airport hotels? 
However, their restaurant food was particularly atrocious, I mean really terrible, and the waiter didn't seem to care. I suppose they have no cook, and the janitor microwaves the stuff. However another restaurant server (or manager?) Martin McMahon was kind enough to notice my discomfort, and deleted the food from my bill. So that made a big difference. Hopefully they will improve the food prep, and hire more employees like Martin M.",2,2015,07,10
245,Comfortable stay,Stayed 1 night after flight from Australia.  Room was comfortable and buffet breakfast had everything. Very quiet room but the pillows could have been  better. Free wifi which is a great thing after such a long trip.,5,2015,07,09
245,Easy access from airport,"We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Dublin airport and I’m glad we did.  We arrived at the airport late one evening and flew out again the next morning.  We only wanted a nice place to spend the night.

To get to the hotel from the airport, make your way to Terminal 1, Zone 8.  There you will see signs for the hotel.  We were told that the shuttle runs every 10-15 minutes, 24 hours per day.  We waited about 15 minutes for the shuttle to arrive and were whisked to the hotel.  It took only about five minutes to get there.

The check-in process was quick and friendly.  We were told to just come to the lobby to catch the shuttle in the morning—no reservation needed.

This is an older hotel that is showing some signs of age.  The carpets in the hallways look worn and the rooms have an overall dull appearance.  The bed was comfortable and the room was large.  There is LOTS of storage space in the room, including a large walk-in closet and lots of drawer space.  There are several electrical outlets in the room, both British and Euro.  Our room was nice and bright because we had a corner room with a large window on each side.  The shower/tub worked well.

There is a strong WiFi signal in the room (no charge).

I think this hotel is a good choice if you need a hotel near the airport.",3,2015,07,08
245,Outstanding staff and service,We enjoyed our one night stay. Very convenient to the airport. Our room was very comfortable and even had an expresso maker in it! Room service was prompt and cost was reasonable.  Breakfast buffet the next morning was fantastic.,5,2015,07,08
245,The food bumps the hotel up a rating.,"I stayed here due to it being close to the airport for a 6am flight. I checked in around 6pm and while it was rather quiet it took about 10 minutes to get my room key. The receptionist had to log onto several computers and also took several phone calls in her time dealing with me. I stayed in 104 and while the room was clean and a pleasant temperature the bed was in a somewhat poor condition with broken slats and very noise to even slight movements. No charging points near by the bed either is a tad inconvenient. The shower pressure was good and the supplied products are refreshing and ample for a few showers. Moving on to the saving grace of this stay, I went for some food in their restaurant and was quickly shown a seat. The staff here were really friendly and an asset to the hotel. I decided to have the fillet steak which was cooked to perfection. The shuttle to the airport is useful in the morning and runs 24 hours a day.
To sum it up I'd stay here again but in all honesty there are more reasonably priced options with a generally better service close by and I could always drive over for a steak.",3,2015,07,06
245,3 Room Changes in 20 min. No A/C. I want my money back!,"I came into town on an overnight layover for a wedding in England only to regret every single moment of the stay. Here is how it went down:

Not explained well enough of the location of the buss pick up. Had to carry luggage to 2 spots before I could get on the right location. 

I checked in early as we got in at 12pm and asked if the room type I requested was available. It was a double bed with a sofa bed. I got the key and went to the room to find out that it was just a double bedded room. I did notice that it was quite warm in the room and didn't find an a/c controller. I went downstairs and they switched it for the room next door. Again, no a/c. I went down again and asked the front counter about the a/c issue and they said that the regular rooms do not have a/c and after a few minutes of explaining how upset I was at that a worldwide company as they are didn't provide a/c, they moved me into the Business Class room. 

Funny thing.... the a/c didn't really work in that room too. The toilet took about 10 times flushing before it went down and it had an ironing board and no iron. At this point I wanted to just sleep and get up for my next destination.  

There were no additional pillows or blankets for the  sofa bed so my travel companion had to just sleep on the top of the bed and I gave him a pillow and the top sheet off my bed. 

As a guest in a hotel that doesn't provide a/c , I rather be told so and have them be honest with me versus being inconvenienced a bunch of times. I could have spent a lot more time with my friends and family rather than moving rooms over and over. I honestly would like to hear personally from the GM of the hotel. I want my money back. I came to this destination for the glam it provided online and its not worth it. I am almost wanting to call my credit card company and fight the charges. 

I know the GM reads this so when you do, please email me at dan-reyes@juno.com

I have a few more trips to Dublin that are layovers. Id like to give this a second chance if they can take responsibility for their lack of service.",1,2015,07,06
245,Hotel,Service was poor. Couldn't get phone to work. No room service when I phoned. Breakfast started too late for my early start. Shuttle came quickly - but left me some distance from the actual departure area - not good as I have a mobility challenge - at this stage I was only one on bus.,2,2015,07,06
245,CAN I GIVE ZERO STARS??,"What can I say, this hotel is absolutely awful compared to other Radisson hotels. We are booked into a business class room.....I hate to think who they hire this room too, it is filthy! Sofabed has white stains on it as photos show, the room is tired & grubby looking... So much for the refurbishment they say on the website.
We went to the Spa......Ha Ha Ha!!!! Not only is it not onsite but the courtesy bus takes you back 50 years to a ""swimmers"" like you went too in the 1960's!!
I am lying on the bed now, which is like a hard rock, whilst looking at the tired grubby room & dirt. I have just looked at bedside table which obviously hasn't seen a duster in quite some time. 
My recommendation is not to come here, I wish I hadn't. Maybe I have been unlucky and got the only bad room in the hotel but this room certainly is not what is shown on the website.",1,2015,07,04
245,Room was like a sauna and air conditioning didn't work ,"This review will be short and straight to the point, we booked three rooms in the Radisson Dublin Airport as a stay over for an early flight next morning to Croatia. The food in the restaurant was great but when we went up to our room (one of three rooms booked) the heat was ridiculous. I thought it was just a simple case of turning the air conditioning on but that didn't work, all three rooms were the same. I had to sleep on top of the bed covers and even then was sweating with the heat. When we checked out early next morning I reported this and the receptionist just said 'oh sorry about that' 
I would never stay here again. ",1,2015,07,03
245,Convenient hotel to the airport terminals,The hotel is close to the terminals. If the weather is nice it is nice to walk instead of taking the shuttle. The lobby area is great but the rooms can be stuffy and hit or miss in terms of quality. The bar menu changed recently and for the better. The people are generally friendly and nice to deal with. If you are lucky enough to be served by Martin in the T3 bar you will rarely find a more genuine and nice person to deal with. He sums up what is good about Irish hospitality. I stay there often for business trips and normally it works out well.  It's a good choice of hotel at the airport and the parking charge is reasonable although long term car park rates have become a lot more competitive.,4,2015,07,02
245,one night at the Radisson,"We booked two beds and had a confirmation thereof.  When we checked in we were told there were no rooms available with two beds and if we were not happy we could go to another hotel, at 6:30 at night at the airport.  We are elderly and need two beds as we both have physical problems.  We had a terrible night's sleep which was horrible and we had a very long drive the next day.  Will never stay there again.",1,2015,07,02
245,Should have stayed at home..,"Lets jus say would have been better off at home with the terrible couch bed we had to sleepin, no cot no pillows..hotels in ireland are excellent.. this was not..over priced and was meant to be a treat for the kids.",1,2015,07,01
245,Take the stress away,"I stayed in this hotel for one night to facilitate early flight departure the following morning. This hotel is within the grounds of the airport and provides a free courtesy bus to both terminal 1 and 2. Aer lingus among many more now operate from T2. Which incidentally is hugely busy and do give yourself plenty of time to check in. The hotel is super . Check in:out very fast and courteous. My room was stylish and the bathroom spotlessly clean. A flat screen TV with all the channels. I had my meal in my room which was delicious. A very good room service menu (with a €5) room charge . I have stayed here on a number of occasions and would not hesitate to recommend it. The price I paid was €163 without breakfast which is expensive , i presume if booked well in advance it would be cheaper. There is a 'grab and go' breakfast in the foyer . Coffee tea cereal bars and fruit , I will return again if my flight is an early one.  Excellent all round.",5,2015,07,01
245,a bit disappointing,"more expensive than many of the other options close to the airport so we expected a bit more. Impressive foyer and our room was quite ok. Bar and food lively and food was also ok.

Breakfast however was disappointing. Bacon, eggs etc all had the look and taste of being cooked en masse at dawn or before !!",3,2015,06,29
245,Don't rely on shuttle service to airport,"We waited over 15 minutes for the shuttle. Our flight was leaving at 5:30 am, so we checked out at 3:45 am (thinking that the shuttle wouldn't be busy...and it wasn't), but as we were exiting the hotel to the shuttle, the driver was entering the hotel and disappeared. We asked front desk several times when it would be leaving. First it was 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, then we were told it's a quick WALK to the terminal! Um... Excuse me, it's 4 am, you have a shuttle service, and you are telling us to WALK. (The driver of the parked shuttle at the front of the hotel is still no where to be seen).
POOR customer service!!
Oh and dingy bathrooms too. Unreliable, period.",2,2015,06,29
245,Perfect base for Dublin! ,"Myself and my husband stayed here as we couldn't get anywhere available in city centre. I was kind of dreading it as it seemed so far from vicar street - where we were going to see comedian. However, it was a perfect base and i would stay there again. Staff were so friendly and accommodating. We rang in morning to have breakfast in room and it was no problem. Taxis were outside and it was only 23 euro to get to Guinness brewery and then we walked to vicar street. Getting a cab back was easy too as we walked to jury's hotel and got a tack outside there! It was great and we were able to lie on until 12 noon. There was a fridge in room and the bed was comfy. It had everything you need for a short stay. I'd definitely stay again. ",5,2015,06,28
245,take on,"Paid for business class room for one night plus 4 days parking = 265 eu.

Room was SAD --curtains hanging off rail --only 2 pillows --lamp shades all at different angles--room was more 3 star standard rather than 4 star business.

Breakfast was grab and go and consisted of tea or coffee plus cereal bars .     How mean.

Complete take on.",2,2015,06,28
245,"Poor facility, Friendly Service but...","As others have noted, the facility is totally worn out -- stained carpets and furniture, poorly designed bathroom, and not enough space between the room door and a closet partition that can injure your hand if you are holding on to the frame of the door while you open it to move luggage in and out.  Having just spent 13 days eating breakfasts at various hotels in Ireland we found food at breakfast to be mediocre at best.  I believe that the sliced cheddar cheese had mold -- unless it's supposed to have white spots on it. 

I will mention that the staff was pleasant and helpful.  However, having just reviewed my charges online this a.m. I found that I was charged twice for the room and appear to be over-charged for a restaurant tab on a room package that included one entree each.  Now I'll have to spend time correcting Radisson's error. 

I really feel that the Radisson corporation should be ashamed to put its name on this hotel.   The rate was expensive and is clearly designed to take advantage of those  willing to stay there for its nearby location to the airport.  I wouldn't trust another Radisson Blu property again.  I'm glad this was our last hotel in Ireland as I think I would have wanted to get back on the plane for home if it had been our first.",2,2015,06,27
245,Good wifi. Otherwise poor quality.,"I stayed one night. I was put into a room for disabled guests (though I am not disabled).  The decor was faded and in need of renovation. A plus was that I could open the window. The shower was on a temporary fixture that produced a horizontal jet of water, so I had to take it off the fitting and hold it with one hand while I showered. The breakfast choice was adequate. I ordered a pot of tea which didn't arrive, so had to ask again for it. In general, the hotel gave the impression of needing of a facelift.",2,2015,06,25
245,Service was fine but the facility is in bad shape,"I don't like to write reviews like this, especially when the service is friendly and attentive. The problem with this hotel is the facility. It is old and banged up (and overlooks a garbage collection area on one side).  The first room we had did not have air conditioning and we had booked a Business Class Room which is supposed to have AC. We were quickly moved to another room but that room reeked of cigarette smoke. The staff was apologetic and quickly moved us again to another room that was satisfactory - except for the view, and the AC still not working that well.  At any rate, I feel bad for the staff because they were all very friendly an accommodating, but the building itself is old, very worn and in need of an upgrade. Maybe the need for AC is an American thing, but I can't sleep in a warm room, and this room was warm.

The breakfast was very good, and as I said everyone at the hotel - from the front desk to the folks who quickly move us from room to room to the guys driving the shuttle were very pleasant. They salvaged our experience. The building itself needs work though.",2,2015,06,23
245,Great stay,"stayed here for 1 night earlier this month before a long haul flight early the next morning. lovely hotel, rooms very modern and spacious. run a shuttle to the terminals which is a great extra but only a 5 min max walk so easily walk-able if you needed to! had dinner in the hotel restaurant, portions quite small for the price but food was decent. overall a good stay would recommend it!",4,2015,06,23
245,Fantastic service. Poor value for money.,"I rate my stay based purely on reflection of the welcoming and friendly customer service I received from front desk clerk Sinead. Having traveled transatlantic for over 8 hours I was fit and ready to sleep before a day of business which awaited me the following day. Upon of arrival (having never visited Dublin before) it became obvious that the location of the hotel was secluded within the airport district with very little leisurely amenities nearby. 

Sinead demonstrated not only a professional and confident service in relation to the regular check in protocol but also voiced a genuine knowledge of Dublin as a whole but also the small towns(Malahide which I visited) which were only 10 minutes from the hotel itself (An approximate €10 cab ride). Sinead not only provided me with a passionate knowledge of the area but also demonstrated an admirable attitude towards the importance of the customer service(bare in mind I have worked within the personal relations industry for over 15 over years).

I have traveled internationally for many years and I have visited many airport hotels which have been of better standard for the price. Rooms were very basic, food wasn't great however shuttle bus service was punctual and effective in delievery the service expected. 

I applauded staff and management for their intermediate focus on customer importance. I believe it would be of benefit to channel money into the standard of rooms.",5,2015,06,23
245,Quality and Convenience,"We really liked the Radisson Blu Hotel because of its convenience to the airport, the standard of comfort of the rooms, the courtesy bus service and the excellent restaurant.
It was a quick overnight stay but we found the staff to be both friendly and efficient.
I would have no hesitation in recommending it as a very convenient and comfortable airport hotel. It might be slightly dearer than its competitors but I felt we got good value for money and it was worth it for the comfort of the room.",5,2015,06,22
245,What a dump..,"Stayed prior to morning flight.  Lobby and public facilities are nice, but the room was terrible.  We were given a Murphy bed, the chairs in the room were torn, split and stained, and a double had been fitted for a single.  All lights in the room were controlled by one switch and could not be turned off individually.  Service in the restaurant was poor.  Wifi was glacially slow.",1,2015,06,21
245,"Great location, poor hotel","The location is the best if you are flying early out of Dublin airport. The hotel, though modern, clean and busy, is a disappointment. The room for my wife & I had a small double bed and no reading light at all. You had all of the lights in the room on or none. The food in the restaurant was less than mediocre. There was no draft beer and the waiter could recite all of the names of the bottled beer, but didn't know a thing about any of them. The bar/restaurant is a good setup and with a little effort this could be a good place. A great location but don't expect much. ",2,2015,06,21
245,Convenient but that's about it,"Stayed overnight prior to an early start from Dublin airport and chose the hotel for its location and previous good experience with Radisson. Check in staff were pleasant but the rest of the experience was mediocre. Tired furnishings in room, cheap lumpy duvet and bathroom with chipped enamel bath. Air conditioning was out of order. The shuttle bus was handy but a pretty dismal experience for one night, no breakfast and £129.",3,2015,06,21
245,Average Radisson,"stayed here overnight prior to morning flight out of Dublin, hotel looks nice from the outside and offers a shuttle service to and from terminals. Staff polite and friendly.  Rooms are ok, have the items you need but no water provided and had to make tea from tap water! tasted awful like old dishwater, yuck! rooms are clean but as with airport hotels a little more wear and tear.  Ate in the restaurant/bar area, food was not good had the fish andchips, batter was so thick and hard that it was almost unpaletable. Breakfast was fine. overall not the best value for money. Wifi was awful and couldn't get a good connection.",3,2015,06,18
245,Convenient to airport,"Kind of a typical large travel hotel. Clean, busy, bedrooms typical for a large hotel. Very convenient to airport, easy to get a ride to the airport. Hotel bar had good food for a bar, but it took us 3 hours to eat and then get our bill for the food!!",4,2015,06,18
245,"A pleasant stay, but poor value for money","From the outset, I had very high expectations of this hotel; the Radisson name, the impressive exterior, good reviews here on TA and the promise of a ""super breakfast"" made me willing to shell out a rather princely sum for a ""business class"" room. However, the very best thing about this hotel is the location, within short walking distance of the airport - and if you can't manage even that, there is a free shuttle! I also found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The (excellent and free) check-in machine in the lobbby saved me quite a bit of time and queueing.

As for the room, I found it to be somewhat less impressive than I had hoped. The staff, probably noticing that the room was booked by two males, had thoughtfully split the king-size bed. However, the resulting twins were far too narrow to offer comfortable sleep, and with equally pathetic sheets. There was also a shortage of power outlets. On the plus side, everything was clean and functional.

The breakfast buffet was good, but like the room, did not quite measure up to the hype. While I found the range of items to be good I have certainly had better at this level of hotel (and indeed, at hotels that do not advertise their breakfast buffet at a main selling point). 

In summary, I realize now that my expectations were inflated and that there really is nothing very wrong with this hotel, if you are willing to pay. That said, there are a number of similarly priced hotels around Dublin airport and I will probably try a different one next time.",4,2015,06,18
245,What a dump...really Raddison?,"Noisy, worn down tatty old room, after visiting 20 different hotels in the three weeks prior to our stay here (in transit to london), this was the worst by a mile of all we visited.
The Radissons brand name has no value to us after visiting this place..

Front desk staff where good and professional, the only plus.",1,2015,06,17
245,Great Buffet Breakfast,"The staff here were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are nice however there are no power sockets next to the bed which is quite inconvenient.

The bathroom is very good, with an excellent shower.

The buffet breakfast is reasonably priced and there is a great range of hot and cold items; the usual cooked breakfast - eggs, bacon, hash browns, toast, beans, tomatoes, sausage , black & white pudding etc but also a fantastic choice of rolls, breads, yoghurt, fruit, smoked salmon and pretty much every breakfast you can think of except waffles!

There is a handy shuttle service from the hotel to the airport.",4,2015,06,16
245,Worth every penny!,"We had a 20 hour layover in Dublin.  Your staff was amazing and advised us how to get to City Centre and visit the top spots on our short stay.  After hot shower and comfy nap,  the shuttle took us back to the airport at 0500.  It was exactly what we were looking for and exceeded our expectations.  Thanks!",5,2015,06,16
245,Great Hotel!,"Stayed here for one night with a friend. It was a late booking so therefore was expensive. Right from the start it was worth every penny. The shuttle bus driver Warren was a fantastic help, he had no problem with helping me with anything I needed or wanted. Check in was stress free. We got an business class room and it was fab! Best bed I have ever stayed in. It had a coffee machine (I had no idea how to work it, Warren the shuttle bus driver offered to help me with it, what a gentleman!). Late check out is free of charge and perfect for late flights! Will be back to visit, would recommend it to anyone. Pay the extra couple of pounds for the hotel and you won't be disappointed. Will be back again!",5,2015,06,14
245,So Convenient and comfortable,"This hotel is really within walking distance to the airport.  But no need to walk because they have shuttles very often.  The room was clean, large and wonderfully comfortable bed. Room temperature was just right too.",4,2015,06,14
245,Shuttle ridiculous,"Close to airport and clean. We told them 3 persons and a fold out double bed was made and ready on arrival.  Room easily fits 4 which was a nice surprise. 

Similar toilet problems, called and someone came in 3 minutes. He said they are in process of changing all toilets.  

Several people I spoke to waiting at airport said shuttle service is consistently poor. Getting to airport is easy because basically the 2 vehicles sit at hotel. Waiting at airport takes 30-60 min regardless if you call or not which is ridiculous since hotel is literally 4 minutes away. My advise is to walk from terminal 2, you can see hotel from airport. Cross the street and there is a nice paved walk. ",3,2015,06,13
245,Airport hotel,"i was for business online one night, the reception was a little slow and real formal about informations of incoming at airport, for example the lady with i asking for repeates me the same informations available on the airport website...the room was quite large and confortable....when i was in the room and it was impossible to push on lights for a long time they said to insert the card in the apposite bucket that really was not and there was a main switch that operate everything...sorry but you cannot so cunfused ",3,2015,06,13
245,Worst room service ever?,"Okay - so it is an airport hotel, and I guess you shouldn't expect much of it, but the food here is genuinely shocking. 

I ordered room service for lunch when working in my room and received probably the worst plate of food I've ever been served in a hotel. 

I probably should have guessed when the person answering the phone didn't know the name of the dish that I was ordering - but the food that arrived was appalling. Two tiny pieces of stale bread, some cheap chopped ham smothered in mayo and a pot of raw prawns. 

Hotel itself is passable as a stopover - but don't expect anything other than barely functional. ",2,2015,06,13
245,A 2 star at best,"I have sent a similar email to the hotel about our stay and received a nice email apologizing which I am appreciative of but the facts have not changed.  We have stayed at many airport hotels all over the world and some much cheaper than the price we paid for this hotel.  We paid extra and got the business class room. I shudder to think what a standard room looks like.  In reading the glowing reviews I'm wondering whether we even stayed at the same hotel as these people.  The reception are of the hotel is clean and bright and I cannot find fault with it.  Once we took the elevator up to our room this is where the problems start.  There are stains all over the carpets in the hallways.  The room is a fair size but it's very outdated.  The only reason I gave a 2 star rating rather than a 1 star was because the room was clean.  There was a Nespresso machine in the room. However, a Nespresso machine doesn't not make it a 4 star hotel as they claim to be.  The bathroom was horrible.  Whatever contraption they have in the toilet does not allow the toilet to be flushed.  You have to pump the handle several times before the toilet will flush which is incredibly frustrating.  There was 1 towel hanging in the bathroom which was so thin you could almost see through it; it was so old it looked grey rather than white.  We did find 2 more towels in the closet.  The bathtub had mold and dirt in the caulking.  The shower had no water pressure the water just trickled out.  The furniture in the room was old and had a ton of chips on them.  We had dinner at the hotel which was ok as far as hotel food goes.  The breakfast buffet was another disappointment. The boiled eggs were so over done that they couldn't be peeled and the yolk was grey. The scrambled eggs were runny, the bacon was cold and was sitting in oil and the coffee was burnt.  I would never stay at this hotel again and I would not recommend it to anyone else either unless things changed dramatically.",2,2015,06,12
245,Okay so long as you dont need to eat,"Spacious rooms and the kind of facilities you'd expect from a Radisson. Let down by the long waits and check in and the simply dreadful food.

Whilst the quality of the double glazing, air conditioning, curtains and bed will mean you get a decent nights sleep. Do not under any circumstances consider eating anything here. 

The menu in the restaurant has been designed by someone who knows very little about food and is prepared by someone who knows even less about cooking. This must be the home of the most disappointing fish and chips in the world. Overcooked, dried out and burnt cod served inside the thinnest layer of amazing undercooked batter. Only matched by the slices of scrambled eggs served at breakfast.",2,2015,06,12
245,Very convenient!,"Very adequate for overnight stay before our early departure the next morning with shuttle service.  Glad we did, especially after the long drive from Derry up North.  Convenient to the Hertz car rental return.",4,2015,06,12
245,good for a airport stop over,"Booked the Radisson as it was more conveinient to stay at the airport. Ive use these Hotels many times before and i have never experienced a Toliet quiet like it. Now i didnt take a picture as posting a picture of me on the toliet isnt something i would do. Bascly the toliet was position behid the door when you opened it and when seated your knees are pressed against the wall. What the hell was someone thinking. Room 440

Another complaint was myself and work colleuge were sat in the bar and i ordered a drining in his absense. When he arrived he instructed the waiter / Bar person to put everything on his room. This was agreed by the member of staff and nothing more said.

On check out they had put everything onto my room and refused to let him pay on his room when checking out. What the problem was i have no idea and it was either the early morning staff member was in a bad mood as when i questioned this and why i had the bill on mine his first and only reply was ""Are you going to pay or not"". He then wouldnt validate my car parking ticket and was quiet rude. I asked if i was too early for breakfast ( it was 6.25am ) and i got a arm thrust at me and him saying ""coffee is there"".

Wont be coming back here again in a hurry.",2,2015,06,12
245,Great,"We had a early morning departure from Dublin and chose to stay at the Radission. I am very glad we did.  It has a free shuttle bus to/ from the airport , we left our car in the car park and got a special daily rate.
Room was modern and clean .
We had breakfast and that was very good, great choice of foods.
On our return we had lunch and again food excellent 
This hotel is very convenient .
I would stay here again.",4,2015,06,11
245,Convenient,"Perfectly adequate airport hotel. Nice room - large enough to contain a small table and chairs as well as the bed and desk.
Nespresso type machine, fridge and kettle added to the comfort. Free WiFi in room.

Good breakfast - including black pudding and white pudding as well as the usual cooked breakfast options

Easy to get into town on the local bus which stops about 100 yards down the road from the hotel and is cheaper (but slower) than the airport bus.",4,2015,06,11
245,"Clean, great gym, amazing staff, superb coffee machine in room!","Clean, great gym, amazing staff, superb coffee machine in room!
5 min walk to airport
The room was large, bed comfy, bathroom clean.
It had a nespresso coffee machine in the room with a selection or pods, along with a kettle and tea of course :-)
can get airport bus straight to dublin every 15 mins for 10 euro return",5,2015,06,10
245,Convenient to Airport,"I had an early morning flight and chose the Radisson because it was close to the airport. It does not disappoint on the front. The hotel is less than a 5 minute drive to Terminal 2. Unlike other passengers who commented about noise, I didn't have any issues.  

The room was better than expected after reading all the reviews. It was clean and modern and the beds were comfortable. However, the outlets in the room did not work, the toilet did not flush properly, and I was not able to connect to the internet. Do not expect a lot of service - the hallways were full of room service trays waiting to be collected both when I arrived in the evening and when I left in the morning. I have stayed at far nicer Radisson Blu's around the world.",3,2015,06,08
245,In need of refurb,"Stayed for one night in June, had a meal in the restaurant which was excellent. The room (305) was tired and the bathroom in need of re doing (shower rubbish,odd position for the loo).The main problem with the room was the air-con, it did not cool the room much and was so noisy sounded like water running all night.Breakfast was good and the free airport shuttle every 10 mins was excellent. I wrote a review on the Radisson at Manchester airport last year and that was the best airport hotel I have ever stayed in, this one has a long way to go.I know you dont stay at a airport hotel for the view but my photo says it all.",3,2015,06,08
245,Business trip with an early morning flight back,"The hotel is ideally placed for an early morning flight out of Dublin Airport. The free shuttle bus is excellent. The hotel staff are lovely and very helpful and the bar / restaurant is also very good. The issue I have is that the hotel is quite tired and needs a facelift, the rooms look dated and very tired.",3,2015,06,08
245,Oh dear...,"Huge disappointment. I am quite a fan of Radisson Blu and have stayed more than once in quite a few, like Bucharest, St Julians in Malta, Amsterdam et al. If this had been my first contact with the brand it would also have been my last. Standard room...left me a bit speechless. A big old wooden frame thing for the bed which had a slope down towards the head. It had been hammered together and the room was spacious, but belonged in a former decade. The whole hotel is dated, shabby and desperately needs a refurbishment. The staff do have the Radisson ""Yes I can"" thing on the whole although the service struck me as a bit laid back. Our room was changed and upgraded for a small sum. Thanks to them for that. Food ok, but they need to rethink their scrambled eggs. Also on the plus side, free WiFi with a strong signal and a free shuttle bus. Location excellent obviously but I would probably not stay here again unless I read that it had undergone refurbishment. ",3,2015,06,06
245,Business trip,This hotel is really good if you need to catch an early flight. They have a shuttle running every 15-20 minutes even at early hours. Rooms are quite comfortable and spacious. Another good feature is that you can there are check in machines in the hotel. The only down side is that I could hear the planes from my room,4,2015,06,06
245,"Friendly Staff, Great Food","This is a great hotel for business travellers.  I had a nice business class room with Nespresso machine, comfortable and clean.
The bar is great for travellers and caters well for single business people.  I had a meal in the bar restaurant - salmon and chocolate torte, both excellent.
Would stay here again",5,2015,06,04
245,Great Staff and good service,We stayed two night at the Radisson Blu airport location. One night when we arrived and one night before we flew out. They have an airport shuttle and are accommodating with breakfast. We had to leave before regular breakfast hours and they brought a nice tray of food to our room at 4:30am. The room was clean and the bar was nice and relaxing.,4,2015,06,04
245,Pretty Good!,"We stayed here with three rooms the night before leaving on a flight. The rooms were nice and large.  We had two deluxe King rooms and one twin room.  It was clean. The staff were pleasant and professional. We did receive our 530 a.m. wake up call and hour early…but they apologized for that. 
We ate in the restaurant which was packed.  We still had attentive service, the food was good for basic dishes.  The wait staff was efficient and friendly.

We took the shuttle to the airport at 6:30 a.m. and it was great to be dropped right at the front door.  We had a rental car and liked the convenience of turning it in the night before and taking the free shuttle over to the airport. 

Do ask that your room has an air conditioner.  The twin room did not have it which we did not know until we had already checked in.  The good news is the windows opened and it was fairly cool out so the room cooled quickly.",4,2015,06,03
245,Shabby,"After Spending two weeks in 5 different top-quality hotels around Ireland, we booked the Radisson at the Dublin Airport due to an early morning flight - what a disappointment! Rooms are shabby and old, bathrooms are sparse - the entire hotel is in serious need of remodeling and updating - yet the staff told me that they are sold out virtually every night (probably one night stays like ours) - so the property owners are most likely just milking it, since most guests will probably never return. I have stayed in Carlson hotels in Mexico and the US and all have been clean and pleasant. Come on Radisson, uphold your standards!",2,2015,06,03
245,Airport hotel,Good choice near the airport and handy shuttle service. The  rooms are nice and quiet so you get a good nights sleep. The bar is handy for a snack or meal when you arrive.  It is expensive though for what you get but the location is so handy for an early flight and the hotel is really clean and well maintained.,3,2015,06,03
245,Close to airport,Used as a convenience to the airport but wasn't disappointed. Rental car lot is close by and hotel runs a shuttle service to the departure area. Hotel has a restaurant which serves snacks and main meals. Rooms were comfortable and there is a petrol station close by if you need to top up the rental car before handing it back. Rental depot runs a bus back to the airport you can get off close to the hotel.,4,2015,06,03
245,Good but no control over heating,"For some v bizarre reason, visitors cannot physically change the settings on radiators. They come on and off at predestined times by a central controller that resides at the top of the building. If the room is too warm or cold, it's tough luck. 
I've never encountered this before

I chuckled when I saw a card in the bathroom where the hotel boasted about being ecofriendly for only allowing one towel yet boiling us in a room where the heating was on o a day where it was 16celsius. 

Why do you do this ?",3,2015,06,03
245,Disappointing Service,"Disappointing front of house service.  Unprofessional check in service, needs to be improved.  I have stayed here quite a few times on business and I have definitely noticed a decrease in service. I followed up after check out via telephone about a query re charges and I was promised a call back.  I have yet to receive a call.
Bar staff were friendly and helpful.",3,2015,06,02
245,Better Than Expected,"I've stayed at Rad Blu's all over the world. We have a 5:30am flight in the morning and this hotel is 5 minutes from the airport. You could walk it in good weather. It's stormy with side ways wind right now so I'm thinking we will shuttle it. It's every 15 minutes 24 hours. 
We got a business class room, it's roomy with a sofa, desk and twin beds about 12"" apart. Snowy white duvets look very inviting. Nice shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and lotion. Robes and slippers. $189USD. 
Free wifi. 
Had a beer in the bar before dinner🍺met a nice local person. 
It's an airport hotel, one of the better if you need one. 🏨
",4,2015,06,01
245,Excellent hotel for airport,Hotel is very close to the airport so excellent when you want to sleep a little later and still get to the airport in time. Bus to Dublin airport leaves every 15 minutes. Hotel staff were pleasant and most importantly room was very clean. The breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and enough selection for everyone's taste.,4,2015,05,29
245,Excellent Hotel,"I would recommend this Airport hotel for its excellent staff, good food and good service. You are looked after in every way which makes your stay worry and hassle free I stay here every time I travel.",5,2015,05,29
245,Promised more than it delivered.,"Chose Radisson for overnight pre-flight stay because it seemed to offer more than usual airport hotel and wanted to enjoy every day of holiday. Started well extremely pleasant shuttle driver looked after bags, delivered to room, enquired about departure time and arranged to collect us following morning. First impression of hotel very positive friendly receptionist generally helpful staff, nice room. Then we went for lunch - restaurant closed (or maybe lunch finished) but we could order from what looked like bar menu, one overworked woman taking orders, clearing tables, taking cash, eventually 2 mediocre salads were delivered. Had intended using pool and spa having dinner too but empty bar and poor lunch sent us scuttling into Dublin for proper meal and some atmosphere. 
Breakfast was fine shuttle driver appeared on time and was again most helpful but feel this hotel is just another airport bed and did not deliver oomph factor.",3,2015,05,27
245,Disappointing return visit to Radisson Dublin Airport,"It is important first to say that we had many previous good experiences at this hotel. However we arrived off a late flight on the night of Sat 18/Sun 19 April to a very disappointing experience. We were tired as it was after midnight and checked in as quickly as possible. The staff were pleasant. The room we were given was on the ground floor. We fell into the bed exhausted, too tired to ask for another room even though our first impressions were that this was a dreadful room. The bed had a thin mattress topped by a mattress topper of some sort and was not the type of mattress we expected in a 4-star hotel. The bedside lights were not what I would describe as bedside since they were behind a wooden panel attached at either side of the bed and one had to get out of bed to turn them off. Then to cap it all we had barely turned off the lights when we were subjected to a lot of loud shouting from the next-door room, A man was shouting on the phone to someone who had evidently turfed him out of his house. Eventually he stopped after much banging on the wall by us and on his door by someone else. Not the hotel's fault I know but it didn't help. Next morning I mentioned our disappointment with the room very politely at check-out. The young lady merely said ""I'm sorry. I'll make a note to have a better room for you next time"". There were people waiting to check out, my husband had just pulled up outside with the car so I left it even though this was a far from adequate response. This room was not a 4-star room, it was not even a 3-star room and in a 4-star hotel one expects that even the ""standard"" rooms are kept to a certain standard. So will I go back there - yes but I will not sleep in that room or any like it again.",3,2015,05,27
245,Some great people!,"After 5 weeks travelling in Europe we arrived in Dublin from Lisbon and had an overnight stay before starting the long trip home to Australia.  And it was that this last night was spent at the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport.

The hotel is just a few minutes on a shuttle bus from the airport terminal (in fact, In the time it takes to get from the airport to the bus stop, you probably could have walked in the other direction to the hotel).  Anyway, the bus got us there where we were greeted by an incredibly friendly female receptionist.  I’d love to give her a shout-out as she really was great, but I don’t recall her name.

Other than the lovely receptionist and another great staff member in the restaurant (Jack, I think his name was), this hotel really is somewhat forgettable.

It ticks all the boxes of an airport hotel, but the rooms are a bit tired and could really use a bit of an upgrade.  Despite their appearance, they do have everything that you would want when spending about 11 hours in an airport hotel.

As with most airport hotels, the food and drink was expensive.  The pizza I had at dinner was not very good.  My partner had a burger, which was quite good.

After our 7pm arrival, we were up and out by 5.30AM to start the long journey home.  The bus got us back to the airport in plenty of time.

Overall, it’s an airport hotel, they are never the highlight of any trip, but if I ever need a hotel at Dublin airport again before a flight, I’d probably give this one another shot.",3,2015,05,26
245,Worst nights hotel sleep ever,"I can not speak for other rooms, but avoid room 410 as it has a serious problem with the radiator.  The thermostatic valve seems to be electronically controlled with no apparent method for the occupant to control it.  Throughout the night the room would heat up until the thermostat closed the valve.  When the radiator cooled down, the valve would open again making quite a loud mechanical screeching noise.  This went on and off throughout the night.  The hotel was informed about this problem via their online messaging system but I've never had any acknowledgement from them.",3,2015,05,25
245,Good hotel,Nice facility and breakfast. It's very easy to bus station and the airport. The room size is very enough and comfortable. The only problem in this hotel I could find is that the staff in reception is cold....without smile...,4,2015,05,25
245,"Friendly staff, clean room - Very convenient to the airport","The room was pricier than expected, but it was clean and the staff was courteous and helpful.
The shuttle bus to the airport was great.  The breakfast buffet was good with many excellent choices.
If I need to stay at a Dublin airport again, I'll return to the Radisson Blu.",4,2015,05,24
245,Cash cow for the convenience of staying on airport ,"Disappointing from check in as not greeted with any sort of welcome or smile. Had to ask about facilities including meal times, bars, gym (which closes at 6 on a Saturday), shuttle bus etc. The room rate we paid was far in excess of the maximum allowable under the Irish Tourism law that was displayed in the room. Room was modern, clean and spacious. Basic considering it was Business Class - not even any drinking water. Bar service was poor which is surprising as in my experience bars in Ireland offer the best service of anywhere I have travelled. Bar food was indifferent. I spoke to the duty manager at the end of the night who made apologies but had an answer for everything - offered nothing by way of compensation. In my opinion service fails from the top down - plenty of staff training required. ",2,2015,05,23
245,An average airport hotel,"This hotel is ok for the first and last night of your vacation if you are flying in and out of Dublin, but don't book your whole stay here. It is within walkable distance to the airport, and they also run a shuttle. It was 27 Euros for four of us to taxi into Dublin. Even though the web site mentions a free 'grab and go' breakfast, no one in the serving areas seemed to know what we were talking about when we asked about it. The front desk staff was friendly (especially Mabel, who was extra helpful).",3,2015,05,23
245,Poor for Radisson,"Staff welcoming & public areas in good condition, but room needed refurbishment.  

The air conditioning control didn't work.  It could be switched on at 18 or off.  The temperature wouldn't adjust & when switched off the radiator heated up.  This gave a choice of freezing or boiling, or turning the air con on & off every 20 mins.  

I phoned down to reception who said they would send up maintenance, two hours later I phoned again. Someone arrived at the door with an electric fan!! Phoned again, spoke to a third person who said that no controls worked on the fifth floor, but not to worry because the heating went off at 22.30 so the room would cool down.",2,2015,05,23
245,Tired Airport Facility,"Early morning flight dictated this hotel near Dublin Airport with a Courtesy Bus.  Large uninteresting block with good sized rooms ,and beds quite acceptable.  Although the room was booked two weeks before our stay we were given the key to a disability bedroom.  I have no problem with this but they should have told us as this room does not have a bath.  The Dining/Bar/Bistro area is huge and impersonal with dark brown very popular. The furniture one would find in a well frequented city centre cafe/pub.  This place badly needs a makeover and I don't mean a ""lick"" of paint.!  At 8-00pm at night the Irish stew was bland and tastless and over ""stewed"" and Confit of duck was the worst I ever had - dry, tough and tasteless. Early 6-00am courtesy breakfast consisted of cold tea or coffee in a cardboard cup and an apple served in the foyer.
Not good enough.  This is a 3 star establishment.",3,2015,05,20
245,Convenience and quality all in one!,"I have stayed at this hotel every time I traveled to Ireland for the last 5 years.  It is consistently comfortable, with good food, good service and a great breakfast!  I don't eat the full Irish breakfast, but it is available, along with too many other items to recall!  I always enjoy my stay.  I find the price comparable to other hotels in Dublin, and it is so close to the airport that I have occasionally walked there!  But, they have a shuttle tht will deliver you right to your terminal, and it runs every 10 minutes.",5,2015,05,19
245,Very convenient for Dublin centre,"The Radisson Blu is an Excellent hotel situated minutes from Dublin airport with good connections into Dublin avoiding paying city centre prices. It is modern, clean and efficient with friendly staff.",4,2015,05,19
245,Typical Airport Hotel,"Whilst the hotel was comfortable, the only conversation I had with any staff members was when they asked me if I wanted tea or coffee at breakfast (and promptly forgot). Other than that, I didn't speak to a soul. I struggled with my luggage to my room without anyone offering assistance. Lovely hotel; impersonal service.",3,2015,05,19
245,Hotel review,"The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was plentiful and delicious with a good variety. The hotel rooms need upgrading.  The prices in the restaurant need to have tax included as is the custom in the remainder of Ireland, not added as an extra.  The restaurant food for an evening meal should be improved.",2,2015,05,19
245,Some issues that need to be addressed,"We liked the hotel overall except for a couple of issues.  The first stay was when we first arrived in Dublin Ireland.  The bathroom toilet kept running and wouldn't flush so my husband fixed it.  The second time was the night of our departure from Ireland and they first were going to charge us more than when we stayed the first time.  When we said we would just look around at another hotel they changed their minds.  This time the toilet had a large crack in the bottom and would only flush when you joggled the handle, the TV did not work at all(would not come on even after checking connections), and most important was the lack of a wake up call....fortunately my husband woke up early so we didn't miss our flight.  It was clean which is very important.  It would have been nice to receive a discount due to the problems especially the second stay.",2,2015,05,18
245,Well...it's very close to the terminal,"I've stayed here a few times. Work insist and so you toddle along but it actually feels like you are visiting Mars. The staff are ok..the rooms are reasonable but the general feel is of a hotel that just serves its purpose. Expensively. The food is average, I was given key to another guest room and after walking in on them, freaking, and getting a new key I was treated as though I had broken into the room. Um...no. You gave me the key. Itsan ok hotel for the terminal but not really adequate for a Radisson.",3,2015,05,17
245,OK for an airport Hotel,"If you are traveling and have a early flight the hotel is convenient. Located in the airport area, the hotel provide a complimentary shuttle bus every 15 minutes to the terminal.
The hotel staff is friendly and helpful, the restaurant is OK (no food is served after 10.30) and the rooms are comfortable but if you sleep in the room that look to the terminal the quality of sleep is not great since you can hear the noise from the road below.
In general is OK for a night and if you really need to be in the airport early but the standard is not as the other Radisson I tried in the past.",3,2015,05,16
245,Good comfortable stay the night before our flight,"Stayed here once before. This time it was quite late when we arrived (thanks to a last minute hurried drive up to Dublin in the car when a planned bus didn't arrive!), almost 10pm so we just wanted to check in and get to bed. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming and we were checked in quickly. There is a stand alone machine in hotel reception that allowed us to book in for our flight with aer lingus the next morning and print out our boarding cards. That's a really useful service and definitely saved us time the next morning. I think they do Ryanair as well. Room was a good size, comfortable and warm, decent big bed (last review mentioned camp bed - don't know what that was about - we got a normal hotel bed!!). Bathroom clean, well stocked with nice toiletries and plenty of hot water at 4am for our showers. Friendly checkout at 4.30am by the same guy who checked us in - a long night for him!!! Breakfast was a 'grab and go' concept in  reception - fresh tea and coffee in take away cups, fruit, alpen bars and so on - just right and very nice touch at this early hour. Shuttle bus was waiting to take us over to terminal 2 - took about 5 minutes. This is a very convenient choice for an early flight, at least we managed to get 6hours sleep!! Also good wifi.",4,2015,05,16
245,Disappointing,"Stayed here for one night in May, booked through Hotels.com. Unfortunately the hotel was only able to get us a double bed (we would have rathered a twin). Our room on the first floor (137) was dreadful. The window didn't close properly, the bathroom door didn't close, the cupboards were scuffed, the coffee cups were not at all clean, the chairs frayed and stained; and worst of all the bed was a fold down from the wall, which was uncomfortable, small and crampt. A few positives to note: the friendly staff and the fast, free wifi. We felt our room was designed to double up as a meeting room - all the fixtures seemed like they could easily be removed; and the TV hadn't been plugged into the wall.
Overall, the hotel needs much in the way of refurbishment to come close to the minimum standards I would expect of a Radisson.",2,2015,05,16
245,Airport Access the Plus,"If you have a flight and don't want to pay over 25 Euros for a cab, stay here overnight.  there is nothing to do but rest up for your flight.  The food in the restaurant is OK... the staff are very nice and there is a shuttle to the airport every 15 minutes.  The beds are like camping beds, so don't expect a great sleep but there are trade offs....The hotel looks like it has been renovated but it is not the type of hotel you expect of the Radisson blu series.",3,2015,05,15
245,Walkable from the airport,"Radisson Dublin airport 4* Walkable from the airport
I like using the Radisson chain of hotels because you know what you are getting –mid price range, good location, free internet, reasonable rooms etc. This hotel does not disappoint but is probably at the lower end of Radisson range of hotels I have stayed at. The hotel is showing its age and needs modernisation in part, yet I had a comfortable stay and will gladly stay here again. It is very convenient if you have an early flight from Dublin airport.
The hotel is on the left as you approach Dublin airport from the main road or on the right as you leave the airport. It is accessible by walking from the airport building. Although there is a complimentary minibus from the airport, it is an easy 5-10min walk. I have never stayed here befor, but found it quite easily by walking past terminal 2 downhill. You can actually see the hotel from terminal 2 so you will not get lost. 
What I did not like?
a)	Reception staff taking telephone calls rather than serving you. I waited patiently in line both on arrival and departure, yet rather than serving me plus the receptionists took telephone calls (on one occasion for room service). Why is it justifiable to keep me waiting rather than keep the person on the phone waiting? 
b)	The air-conditioning/heating system in the room was not working. The towel heater in the bathroom was also not working.",4,2015,05,14
245,Great staff,"We arrived after some 30 hours of travel so not in too good of a condition to be a happy traveller , we were greeted by the most of friendly staff and quickly checked into the hotel and our luggage delivered to our room .We did have a slight hickup with the room but once reported the problem it was quickly sorted to our satisfaction and apoligis offered.
Our room was large and clean with a  most comfortable bed a necessity for us with a view to the airport.
Dinner at the hotel was one where the service was paramount and the food very acceptable.
Breakfast was fantasitc with a large selection cant complain here , close to the airpot within walking distance",4,2015,05,14
245,We wanted to like it again...,"Our expectations are mild at the best of times. We stayed here September 2013 and again recently in May 2015 and both experiences were wildly different. The earlier version was that the room was somewhat worn, but we had a wonderful meal in the restaurant the evening before our departing flight and a wonderfully happy fellow met and shuttled us to the airport at 4 a.m.  That was all good.

This time, not so much. The room was disappointingly shabby and didn't meet what we have experienced with Radisson Blu hotels, which we have stayed at all over Ireland (kudos to RB's on Golden Lane and St. Helen's in Dublin). If it were not for the airport convenience, I do not think we'll stay here again, even for a pre-flight sleep.

A nice perk of being a concierge level with Carlson Club loyalty points is an automatic upgrade if available. Never, ever expected, but always nice. When we asked politely if we were upgraded (usually we don't have to ask), we were told the room was already prepared for us and they can't change anything, so we accepted that and went to our room. The little package of chocolates were nice, but the standard room was again worn and tired. That's ok. We felt that way too.

We decided to revisit the hotel restaurant for our last meal in Dublin. The prior visit here was great with amazing food. We had had such a lovely one the last time, one could almost forgive anything else. The special daily meal of roast beef looked terrific on the cheesy clipboard menus we were handed. We both felt the special was up our alley, but there sadly was none left (understandable at this time of evening, but maybe let us know). The server seemed cool, unfriendly and removed and never mentioned the special was all gone until we decided to order. That's ok. We would order off the other part of the clipboard menu (felt like I was back in the office). The clipboard and printed off menu pages felt cheap and awkward and didn't seem to suit the hotel.

Pizza and Fish and Chips. How can one go wrong? We truly aren't fussy. We have always had beautiful meals on our travels through Ireland. Both of these were terribly disappointing for the price. It seemed like frozen, battered fish (pan burned on the bottom) and the thin-crust pizza was doughy and tasteless. Our driver at 3 a.m. was a nice touch, but not conversational whatsoever. Fresh coffee in the lobby at 3 a.m. but no cups available for guests. Showering at 2 a.m. in the morning with just a handheld device (showerhead didn't work). 

We have stayed at Radissons in many places all over the world and we have had nothing but good experiences. We can forgive human glitches and maybe some random so-so meals and/or service. We are not hard to please, but this experience left us completely cold.",2,2015,05,12
245,Not Impressed,"I stayed here a few days ago after a long trip back from Vegas. Having stayed at a few Radisson hotels before and been very impressed (especially in Galway), I was looking forward to this stay. Sadly this hotel does not deserve the Radisson name The room cost 159 euro which for this particular hotel is daylight robbery. 

Firstly the gym. You need to get a shuttle to it! After travelling from Vegas I was looking forward to a nice swim to reawaken me. After hearing I needed a shuttle I was put off by the idea. The bar restaurant area is very formal and the complete opposite of relaxing. When eating my dinner I couldnt wait to get out of there. Speaking of dinner the duck with lentils was BAADDD...The only positive is the service was very good

The room was ok but the the bath is tiny and the balcony was filthy (empty coke bottles and debris). For the price you pay its an utter rip off. Best look elsewhere...",2,2015,05,12
245,"Recomended to stay in Radisson Blu, Dublin Airport","The hotel rooms are clean, comfortable bed, internet is good. The breakfast is good. Plenty of option. The hotel is located at a walkable distance from airport. The staff are helpful. There are enough car parking space available.",5,2015,05,11
245,stay in hotel,"very good.   excellent service, good food, clean room and bathroom.   Very good value for money.   Excellent staff and service.   The ambience and overall experieence was second to none.   Overall it was a ver pleasurable experience.",5,2015,05,11
245,Clean and Convenient,"We were forced to stay here after our hire car company screwed up our booking.  We were tired and frustrated and walked into this hotel with no reservation.
They sorted us out quickly and were incredibly friendly even if we may have been visibly disgruntled.

Would recommend as a quick stop over before/after a flight",4,2015,05,10
245,Great location,"This hotel is basically at the airport.  Great for out 6:30am flight!  Downside, it was a $40 cab ride downtown.  Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful.  Our room was nice, clean, & comfy.  We booked again for our return flight",4,2015,05,10
245,Excellent nights sleep!,"Asked for a quiet room and received it. Excellent nights sleep. Proximity to airport made it ideal for my early morning flight. Staff extremely helpful. One guest had overslept and was in danger of missing his flight, they drove him to the required terminal immediately. That is customer service for you!",5,2015,05,10
245,Disappointing ,"We stayed one night in this hotel on return from a trip abroad.  

The shuttle bus service and parking facilities were good.

However, the decor was generally tired.  The bar was cold and unwelcoming, so much so that we left without having a drink.  The breakfast was below expectations.

Overall, our stay did not match experiences in other Radissons and we would not return.

",2,2015,05,09
245,The hotel was warmer than the location for the cricket international.,"Our plans changed at the last minute and we needed to stay at a hotel near Dublin airport, I chose the Radisson as I have stayed there a couple of times on business preferring it to the other airport hotels. We actually arrived at the hotel around 9am (prior to going to the England vs Ireland cricket match) not expecting to be able to check in to our room.However we were greeted by a most friendly member of the reception team who was so helpful, we thought we would only be able to drop our bags off, but we were allocated an upgraded room then and there, truly outstanding service delivered in a most charming way. Several hours later we returned to the hotel, the hotel reception area is impressive light and spacious, our room was on the second floor, the decoration in the corridor to our room was a little tired, but the corridor was clean and tidy. Our room was reasonable large, and like the hall clean and tidy, the bed was not the largest but comfortable, the bathroom was also a good size with a full size bath, whilst happy with the the room it did lack a certain "" wow factor"" and will need some TLC before too long, the room was beginning to look tired. The restaurant  was well furnished, with a good mixture of chairs , arm chairs and bar stools. The quality of food for dinner was good,I had the haddock special and my wife selected a premium burger, not the most exciting choice by us,but it suited our mood and the style of the restaurant. The food was served by a very cheerful waiter. Breakfast served in the same location was ok, the selection of fruit seemed to have perhaps spent some time in a tin, the yoghurt  was somewhat bland too, it was good to have the hot selection served by a real person, such a pleasant change from the self service model used by most hotels. The sausage and bacon were both excellent, the hash brown looked pale and delivered very little taste. On departure we again received the highest level of customer service. What makes this hotel almost unique in my experience of corporate hotels is the total lack of plastic sincerity "" have a nice day"" tosh etc. Given this is an airport hotel the management and staff must have to deal with a significant number of short term occasional guests, and yet we were made to feel as though we were ""regulars"" in the way we would be in a local pub/ restaurant, as I observed  were many other guests, quite remarkable in the circumstances.",4,2015,05,09
245,Excellent Hotel with top class service,"Staff are wonderful, especially at reception and in the bar and restaurant, wonderful buffet breakfast selection, rooms are comfortable and sizeable and the cleanliness is outstanding.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone",5,2015,05,08
245,Rooms are tired and need updatng. Good food and service.,"I had a business class room, and it was old and tired.  Tiles lose in bathroom, toilet hard to flush, old wooden furniture. This place is in major need of remodeling.

The service is excellent. The breakfast is very good. The restaurant/bar is fun.",3,2015,05,06
245,For short stopovers only,"The hotel is a short shuttle bus ride from the airport and is good for early morning flights from Dublin Airport. There are coffee and snacks at reception if you have to leave at an unearthly hour in the morning. The staff are a lot friendlier than the ambience of the hotel. The room that we had was a good size, but extremely cold, which the staff responded too by bringing us an extra heater. The food was expensive and average. I am not sure that I can put my finger on why, but the my overall impression was one of bleakness - perhaps this was simply the weather  and the view out of the window.",3,2015,05,06
245,Great Airport Hotel,"After touring Ireland for two weeks, we headed back to Dublin to catch our flight out the next day.  We decided to stay at the Radisson to reduce the stress of catching an early morning flight.  The hotel is very easy to find.  Check-in was a fast.  The check-in person was very friendly and accommodating.  We stayed on the fourth floor facing the airport.  Our room was clean and no issues.  There was no noise from the street or arriving and departing airplanes.  It was raining so we decided to eat in the lounge/dining area.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The menu has a wide variety of selections to choose from that should satisfy most travelers.  Our dinner arrived without delay and was prepared as requested.  Check out the next morning was quick and easy.  We grabbed the free hotel shuttle, which runs every 15 minutes.  The shuttle driver dropped us at our departure airline.  Easy in and out with comfort is exactly is why we chose to stay at the Radisson to catch our early-morning flight back to the US.",4,2015,05,06
245,Over night stop before flying out,We always stay at the Radisson blu when flying from dublin starts the holiday off well great hotel spotlessly clean good facilities also top knotch breakfast saves on airport food which i find not so good. ,5,2015,05,06
245,Awful,I would give it 0 stars if i could. The flush for the toilet wouldn't work. I went down for dinner and it took them over 40 minutes for a simple order and they just speeded it up because i complained. After all this i was overcharged on my credit card for over 30 euro. Not what i was expecting,1,2015,05,05
245,Good but please improve breakfast,"Stayed here a couple times as perfect location to the airport. There is a free shuttle that runs between the hotel and the airport however it's walking distance. Considering most people stay due to early flights an improvement on the breakfast offered is desperately needed. Bad coffee and a few apples hardly make up for an inclusive breakfast rate. How about some fresh pastries, yoghurt, bottled water perhaps all things that don't cost much, that you can quickly grab in the morning and that would add value to one's stay and experience. ",3,2015,05,02
245,Dublin Airport Radisson Blu,"Have stayed here before and would stay here again. Great location if taking early morning flight from Dublin Airport. Good service & friendly,helpful staff. Clean. Good food and nice rooms. Very good value for money. I would recommend.",4,2015,05,02
245,flying out overnight,"Hotel good, clean, staff friendly and really efficient, nice bar, parking privileges for $7.50 a night, internet included. Breakfast expensive, 18 Euros per person, Close to airport with a shuttle running every 15 minutes",4,2015,04,30
245,Just ok,Stayed here for one night before flight next morning.  Staff very friendly. In the bar food overpriced for the quality and quantity presented.   Room was arctic cold but on a plus the bed was super comfy,3,2015,04,29
245,Mediocre experience,"Unimpressive hotel, staff are unhelpful, had to sit in the lobby to make my booking as the receptionist couldn't find the cheaper rate available in their system, I booked via their own website. The rooms are tired and in need of deep cleaning, nespresso machine broken, no plug for the bathroom sink, empty dirty mini bar, restaurant shuts very early, impossible to get anyone's attention in the bar. Wouldn't choose it again.",3,2015,04,29
245,Worst hotel ever,"it started at check in where i received the warm welcome and no upgrade despite my regular visits. The room is like a camp site. Sufficient, but that is about it. No facilities whatsover. Went to restaurant where i paid 20 euro for a meal worth a fiver. Direct from fridge in fry pan.  The only advantage is the location and fact that beer is from tap. I will walk tomorrow since i have no confidence at all. After st helens, which was great this is a total deception.",1,2015,04,28
245,"Not bad, room very cold","Excellent checkin had dinner in T3, room was good and service excellent,
My room 146 was very spacious and clean not a bad room but for the draft coming from the windows, the draft excluder was missing so the wind was blowing through the room ending up putting a towel across window to block the draft .

Break fast was good, not a bad hotel just a pity the draft in my room, would of thought it would of been picked up before putting guests in.",4,2015,04,27
245,A nice convenient place to stay,"The hotel has easy access from the motorway and conveniently situated to the airport terminals.  The staff at the hotel were very welcoming, friendly, efficient and nothing was too much trouble.  The check-in and check out was prompt and polite.  The rooms were spacious, clean and the beds were very comfortable.  There was tea and coffee making facilities, a small fridge, free internet access, and a good choice of food on the room service menu.  There was also complimentary toiletries.  The courtesy bus ran frequently and we used it a few times to take us to the terminal 1 where we caught a no 16 and no 41 bus into Dublin for 3.10 euros.  The car parking was convenient.  We used the bar a couple of times but thought it was a bit soul less - maybe a few plants in this area could soften it a bit but just a minor detail and it wouldn't put me off using it. The lift had broken a few times whilst we were there and it was a bit of an inconvenience as my husband has walking difficulties but despite this I would stay there again and just request a room on a lower level.",5,2015,04,27
245,Thank you,"This is a great location for people traveling early in the morning from Dublin Airport, I could see it would be a fantastic venue for business meeting etc .Looking west you can see Dublin Airport Terminal Two from your  window.I would like to mention Sinead at reception for the upgrade! Andre in the bar for the conversation, one looks a little sad alone at a bar at night. Alexander needs a mention for the same reason, talking is good!",5,2015,04,27
245,T3 restaurant at Radisson Blu,"We stayed for 1 night at the radisson blu.  The hotel was very comfortable. We really enjoyed the restaurant, T3.  My daughter has celiac disease and must eat gluten free.  Our waiter, Victor was wonderful.  He was able to help us choose a safe dish for her. He also brought a side of delicious gluten free bread.",4,2015,04,25
245,"Not bad, would recommend for a nights stay if you only want a stop over.","Stayed one night at the Radisson Blu whilst on a business trip. Very clean, spacious room. Friendly staff on arrival and close to the airport for early flight home. Only issue with this is road noise but was ok. Food good, comfy bed but no mini bar, just a cold empty fridge! Fast internet. Would stay again.",4,2015,04,23
245,inbound out bound,"stayed  1st night in dublin    after landing    nice room-  bar -    good bar food, especially the  house special     burger       also the lamb stew.           staff was fun and professional   silvia at front  desk very nice!       just call from terminal shuttle will pick you up  have stayed here few times now on the trip back to sligo.       also stayed night before return to u s     upgraded room  once again silvia very efficient    nice hotel  and staff.          also    beach bar  aughris    head co. sligo     check out rafters bar and b&b     skreen  co sligio        since 1755 same family owned     tony the bartender  old friend",4,2015,04,22
245,Great hotel by Dublin Airport,"Modern, clean, well priced with good food (especially for a hotel). Rooms are smallish, but nice. Second shower in the morning could have been a little hotter, but wasn't cold. Staff was very nice. If you have to be by the airport, location was great (walkable to Aer Lingus terminal).",4,2015,04,21
245,The perfect place to stay flying in or out of Dublin,"The hotel is literally within walking distance to the airport terminals.  We walked because I had forgotten that the hotel has a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes or so, and, well I could see the hotel, just right over there..  The room was large, clean and very quiet.  Wi-fi was free and easy to connect.  Front desk service was quick and friendly.  Both the restaurant and the breakfast area were clean.  The breakfast buffet has the standard irish breakfast items.  The restaurant has a small but good menu, with a large bar.

Since we were in Dublin for just one night to change planes, our friends met us at the hotel for a visit.  We sat in the lobby area and the restaurant staff brought out food and drinks to where we sat.  The restaurant/bar area was a bit loud for carrying on conversations between the 6 of us, but the lobby seating area was perfect, large and quieter.

Our flight out was 11 am, so this facility we absolutely perfect for us.  No morning rush to eat, pack and drive to the airport.  The sofa in our unit was clean, but a bit worn. That was the only thing in the entire hotel that didn't look in perfect order.

During past trips to Ireland, I have always driven down to the airport (1-2hrs) the morning of the flight.  I think from now on, I will make the drive the night before and stay at the Radisson Blu Airport.",5,2015,04,21
245,Excellent Airport Hotel,"I stayed in the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport in mid-March in order to be close by the airport for an early flight. The hotel is located in a great location, as you can walk from either T1 or T2 at the airport. The hotel also has a shuttle which can drive you to/from the airport. Upon checkin I was offered a well-priced upgrade to a Junior Executive Suite. The Suite was an excellent choice I was going to be in the hotel for nearly 24 hours. The bed was comfy and the room was huge. It was relaxing and quiet. I also ate dinner in the hotel restaurant. The food was good and decently priced for an airport hotel. I also ate breakfast early on the day of check out. The breakfast buffet is huge and quite tasty, with a great selection of food. All in all, I would definitely stay in this hotel again if requiring accommodation near Dublin Airport.",4,2015,04,19
245,Excellent Stay - Great Hotel,"Stayed for one night as flying out again the following morning. Hotel is exceptionally clean, check in was a smooth process. Room was of a good standard, a comfortable sleep in crisp white sheets, always good !. Staff were friendly and helpful

Breakfast choice was adequate from an Irish Fry to cereals, pastries etc. Transfer bus to airport runs frequently. Would defintely use this hotel again",5,2015,04,18
245,Great hotel close to the airport - just need an ice machine and ice bucket!!,"I am currently staying in the hotel which is great - super location if you are flying - walkable from the airport if you don't have much luggage or use a trolley.

The room, staff, breakfast etc are great - my only issue is that there is no ice machine or ice bucket in the room.  I have asked for this several times but the best I have got is a pint glass of ice which melts within the hour.  As a regular international traveller I have yet to encounter any other 4 star hotel which does not have this simple facility for guests.  I would have thought that this would be an issue for many international travelers and would be easily remedied even if it was just available at the bar/reception.

The only other issue which I had was that when I phoned for room service the person I spoke to could barely understand me - I think it is important that someone in this position is able to readily converse in English.",4,2015,04,18
245,Stay Night Before Flight,"Service by staff was excellent, Hotel needs updates, paint and deep cleaning carpets. That work being completed the Radisson Blu can be a special airport hotel with location and convenience in getting to and from airport.",3,2015,04,18
245,Excellent Room & Great Staff,"Excellent room. Fantastic staff, just to mention a couple: the airport shuttle driver and Victor in the restaurant. Very good location for the airport and great links to the city centre. Food was delicious. We were lucky enough to be in time for the early bird menu which was excellent value.",4,2015,04,15
245,Convenient to Airport,The Radisson Blu at the Dublin Airport is very convenient for early departures from Ireland.  The rates and facilities are comfortable.  The drivers are friendly and prompt at getting you to the airport on time. This stay the staff was Irish which is pleasant for vacationers to Ireland.,4,2015,04,15
245,very good airport hotel,"High quality airport hotel, great location, clean, good value, usual facilities that you would expect from an airport hotel, good standard breakfast, nice bar and foyer area, pleasant staff, would recommend",4,2015,04,15
245,Handy if you have an early flight,"Average hotel. Ideally located for the airport. Recent stay prior to early morning flight.
Good size room but it was ""tired"" - needed updating. Had an evening meal in the bar which was enjoyable and reasonably priced. Good shuttle service to the airport early in the morning.",3,2015,04,13
245,Radisson Hotel Dublin Airport,"Arriving off a late flight at 1am with a severely travel sick daughter there was no staff willing to guide us directly to our room, the toilet did not flush and the receptionist rang after 2am in the morning to request our updated credit card details, apart from this disaster the breakfast was very nice.",2,2015,04,13
245,Kinda of gross.. Don't do it unless you need to,"It wants to be a nice hotel,,, it just isn't. The bathroom makes me think of the movie Hostel and there are dried white smears of (ick) on the couch in my room. I don't want to touch any of the surfaces. BUT! If you've an early flight or need quick access from the airport, it's a 10 minute walk to terminal 2 which is very convenient. Can anyone say, cheap airport hook ups?",3,2015,04,13
245,"ok, but nothing special and don't take the room service","I choose the Radisson because, I arrived late at the airport and have to stay there till the next morning. The hotel is really convenient, offers a airport shuttle free of charge (it takes less than 5 minutes and goes every 15minutes). If you arrive after 11, take the courtesy phone in the terminal to get the bus. 

The rooms are OK, as a customer with a status, I've been upgraded to a junior suite.

This one had a king size and a sofa bed, offers a nespresso coffee maker but no mini bar.

The bathroom really small and the shower doesn't worked properly. The coffee maker wasn't working but they changed them soon.

BUT: don't order room service. I have been waiting for a long time after placed my order and the food was awful. can't imagine who could eat this.",3,2015,04,11
245,Good Hotel,Quick overnight stay while waiting for a connecting flight.  The hotel was average with very firm beds.  Wifi was spotty but the food in the restaurant was good while the service was mediocre. The hotel did offer a free shuttle to the terminal in the morning and a small breakfast bar that we greatly appreciated.,4,2015,04,10
245,convenient to the terminals,"We always stay here on our way out, if we have to fly from Dublin, late in & early out. Convenient to either walk or the courtesy shuttle every 15mins to terminal 2, then continues to terminal 1. Although the shuttle only collects from terminal 1. The fold out couches to make beds for kids have extremely thin mattresses, our 9 year old thinks they are uncomfortable. The main beds are comfortable. It seems that maybe they have changed their policy of phone calls take precedence over guests, as check-in wasn't interrupted by phone call(s), which was fabulous.",4,2015,04,09
245,Comfortable and convenient,"For a stopover night, the hotel is brilliant.  The shuttle service is very convenient.  Good spacious comfortable room.  You can roll out of bed and into the terminal. Very friendly staff that accommodated us at 10:45 in the morning instead of only at 2pm. Checking in and out very quick and easy.",5,2015,04,08
245,Must try harder,Rooms not to the standard I would expect from Radisson (I stay with this chain frequently). Bar food service closes early (10:30pm) for an Airport location. Be very specific about what you order from room service!,3,2015,04,07
245,"Great Service, Excellent Location!","I stayed at Radisson Blu Dublin Aiport for the last 2 nights of my 10 day trip to Ireland, as I had a super early flight.  Checked in on Saturday the 28th of March and were assigned room 501 (business class). It is a very bright corner room, with a superb view. Very impressive to see so many planes landing, and so close to us! And despite their proximity the room is very quiet! Our room was very spacious and comfortable and equipped with everything one could need. It seems recently refurbished as the décor is modern and the carpets look very new. We ate in the Bar one of the evenings and the food was good. Had breakfast in the restaurant on the first morning and found it to have an excellent choice and good quality food, nicely presented. Service was attentive. Left at 4.30 am on the second morning and although breakfast wasn’t open, they had a Grab and Run breakfast in the lobby with coffee, fruits and other things that were perfect to take along with you.The location is ideal as it is only 3 minutes away from the airport in their complimentary 24 hour shuttle bus. There are several hotels around Dublin Airport, but by all means, Radisson is the way to go. Thank you for your hospitality (especially to Sureka and Andre and Victor). I will be back!",5,2015,04,06
245,Great family room,"Spacious, Clean, well equipped family Room . Good Food both for restaurant and Breakfast. Parking is charged extra but ask for the discounted rate on check out.  2 min drive to Terminal 1. Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,03,30
245,Great stay pre early flite,"Had early flite to catch so stayed here. It's cheap is hand close to airport. There are car parking facilities and shuttle services to the terminal. A good way to start holiday. Ps great breakfast, just not enough time to enjoy. Family friendly and clean with polite staff.",5,2015,03,25
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport,"The front desk staff & shuttle guy were the only reason for the star. If not for them, my rating would have been blank. I've stayed there a few times and nothing has changed... In fact, I walked into my room with a horrific stench! I proceeded to the bathroom where the scent was the strongest, and I could tell it was from the toilet because no one bothered to wipe off the stains off the toilet where men miss! It disgusting nonetheless! Luckily I switched rooms, but no one should have to check into a ""STANK"" room. Free wifi!

Other than that:

No gym on premise 
No complimentary water bottles
Eating options are extremely limited",1,2015,03,24
245,Comfortable short stay,"I stayed with my husband at the Dublin Airport Radisson Blu for a night before catching a flight. We were not there at a peak holiday time, and were very happy to be given an upgrade to a Business Room. This was larger than the standard rooms, very comfortable, and the sound-proofing from outside noise was very good. We were there in time to enjoy a light evening meal at the bar/restaurant, the only criticism of that was the rather dark lighting. We did not have to leave until 7am, so had breakfast before checking out, which was good. The hotel does supply snacks ""Grab and go"" for earlier departures.
There is a minibus service between the hotel and the termini, but it is not a long distance to walk if you don't have much luggage to carry, and don't want to wait for the minibus.
We have used this hotel before, as it is of a good standard, and is on the airport site. We will certainly use it again, especially when getting an early morning flight out, and would recommend it.",4,2015,03,20
245,excellent hotel,"great value for money, convenient, excellent service , rooms are spacious and the hotel as a great courtesy bus service to the airport. We would even stay here if we were spending a weekend in Dublin as its only about fifteen minutes by taxi to Dublin City",5,2015,03,18
245,Stopover,"Stayed here the night before our flight to NY 
Everything was very clean the room was very spacious.
We ate in the bar and it was excellent 
The bed was so comfey 
We will most definitely stay again the shuttle bus to the airport was an additional added bonus.",5,2015,03,13
245,Friendly and welcoming airport hotel,"I had an early flight and stayed at the Radisson Blu the night before, as I had to get up at 3:30 am and leave by 4:15 am.  I was welcomed at reception and they showed great patience for a weary traveller.  My room was fine - decor to a good standard, large window, flat screen TV, fast and free wifi.  Both a large dressing table and a desk and European and UK plugs available.

I went to the restaurant and found quite a selection on offer.  The food was good and portions were quite large.  The waiters checked that I was satisfied throughout the meal. The ambiance was friendly, and as a single woman traveling, I felt completely comfortable to enjoy my meal (and the rugby game) in the company of others.

The bed and pillows were comfortable and there were no sound issues.  Tea/coffee, apples, water and snack bars were available at 4:00 am for the early birds. Shuttle driver was courteous and it's only a couple minutes to terminals.

I have the same cruel flight week, but look forward to my evening at the Radisson Blu.",5,2015,03,08
245,In airport complex,"Quiet airport  hotel within walking distance of both terminals. Tea making facilities (no wee biscuits) in room, everything clean and comfortable but short on pillows, even given the extra in closet. Shuttle to terminals but it was quicker to walk than wait 10 minutes for next one. Some mornings breakfast bars, fruit and drinks available free in lobby.",4,2015,03,07
245,If you need to be close to the airport,"Very good Location in case you Need proximity to the Airport. For me the Major reason for choosing this place. Generally the Hotel is decent and has offered an adequate value for Money, not the most modern facility ever seen, but absolutely fine for me",4,2015,03,06
245,Nice place to spoil yourself,"I have stayed at the Radisson Blu 3 or 4 times on the night before I fly out.  Drop the rental car off in the afternoon before I fly out and take a shuttle to the Radisson.  In the morning, take the hotel shuttle right to the terminal.  In between I enjoy the pub and restaurants at the hotel and finish off the day with one of the best showers in a hotel.  Ahhhhhhh.",5,2015,03,04
245,Cold comfort farm,"Very dissappointed in a hotel that charges a premium price and offers average bed and breakfast.
The hotel was cold in early evening and offered little in the way of a plesant dinning experience.
When my wife and I saw what was on offer, we took a 25euro taxi ride to Malahide for a special evening meal.
We will book into a Malihide hotel next time ew are flying from Dublin.",3,2015,03,04
245,Functional if slightly impersonal,"We chose the hotel for proximity to the airport and the fact it was a Radisson. Airport shuttle service excellent, hotel check in painless and room well appointed but in need of refresh particularly the bathroom.  Ate in the restaurant, food was good as was the service.  Made use of the late check out for which there was no charge till 1500.",3,2015,03,02
245,No Heating in Standard Room costing €120/night,"Arrived at hotel after midnight, after a long flight.  No heat on in the room, which was very cold.  Raised the issue at checkout to be told that heating goes off at a certain time and that I could have requested an electric heater!    Now my point is that you don't put paying guests into a cold room in February in Ireland no matter what! Had the  radiator in the room been left open when the heating system was on there would have been sufficient heat to keep the room warm during the night!",3,2015,03,01
245,Its an airport hotel,"The Radisson Blu is very conveniently located, especially for Terminal 2. But if you're planning to stay, don't expect much more than your usual airport hotel. I don't think its as good as the Bewley's, though its better than airport hotels we've stayed at in other cities. The decor is looking well-used, but the rooms are quite decent and the beds are comfortable. Another plus: the tv volume and reception was good. 
We didn't get too much noise from the airport traffic, but were constantly woken by doors banging to each of the rooms along the hallway - and as an airport hotel, there is a lot of coming and going at really late and really early times. 
The shower was ok - not great - but definitely better than others! We took a meal up to our room and it was very decent - though a bit overpriced, as is normal for a hotel meal. They charge extra for parking, and we also found the rooms quite cold - it took a lot of waiting before the temperature became comfortable. 
Also we found the shuttle service quite unhelpful - which could be an issue if you're using Terminal 1. Just make sure you ask in advance and allow plenty of time if you need to use it. 
The hotel has good amenities, but don't expect a really nice hotel.",3,2015,03,01
245,Convenient and comfortable hotel,"Hotel is perfectly located close to Terminal 2, with an excellent shuttle bus service.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Room was comfortable but basic.  Food was very good. Stay night before early morning flight.  Despite its location, there was very little aircraft noise, therefore, slept well.  Would stay here again.",4,2015,02,26
245,Lifesaver,"After a one day delay and a missed flight from Dublin I went on line looking at agoda to find about six hotels in the airport district available after talking to the security guard at the airport he said The Radisson is the closest and he pointed at it from the exit door,i asked is it possible to take the trolley he said no problem so of I went with the airport trolley,when I got there in about five minutes there were a few trolleys left across the road from the hotel so I left my trolley there and carried my bag across the road.Check was swift as I had already booked about 10min earlier.Our room was spot on,the bed was very comfortable and our wake up call was bang on 4am.At check out there was a free snack breakfast spread put on,tea,coffee,fruit,snack bars,water just the ticket.While we were having a tea we were asked if we needed the free airport shuttle bus,yes please,job done,Thanks Radisson for a nice but brief stay.",5,2015,02,24
245,Short Stay,The hotel facilities are very good overall. Spacious room. Provide transport to airport at any time. The reception staff is friendly and very helpful. Provide portable heater because the room heater is on a time schedule under master control system. Really feel comfortable staying at the hotel.,4,2015,02,23
245,Convenient Location,"Nice room, Nice staff, easy check in, check out, transport to airport 2 mins and car parking provided for 5 days was good but could have been discounted more. Restaurant had good food, little expensive for bar food.  Good service at restaurant however it was extremely noisy due to one particular group being extremely drunk. Room was good, quiet and big. The air con was not working and throughout the night had to open the window. Overall it was a good stay.",4,2015,02,22
245,Great hotel ,Stayed here for 2 nights in Feb. Location is perfect for airport or you have any business on the side of the city. The lady that checked us in was really nice ( think her name was Meera? Didn't have my glasses on so not 100% sure!) she even gave us a free room upgrade. The room (business class) was very comfortable and clean. I am a really light sleeper and the noise from planes didn't wake me at all . The free wifi was also great and we were able to work on laptops and stream a movie with no problem. There was ample secure parking for €7.50 per night. We ate one dinner and one lunch here and both were lovely . Our waitress Katie was very nice. This was our first stay at this hotel and I will definitely return. ,4,2015,02,21
245,Stayed one night upon arrival in Ireland,"We arrived very late in Ireland and hoped to get to bed early to help with jet lag.  First we waited outside in the cold for 45 minutes on the hotel shuttle.  The staff at the hotel were very nice and helped me with my I Phone trying to get online.  The breakfast was kind of pricey, but was excellent. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice. Overall the hotel was basic and I'd stay there again.",3,2015,02,20
245,The only plus is that it is convenient for the airport,"We arrived and was given an awful room on the first floor. Horrible decor, broken funiture from the sixties. The so called sofa bed, was horrible and not possible to sleep in. The marble top on the desk was cracked and in two pieces. Bathroom poorly cleaned and no bin in the bathroom. Pillows uncomfortable. The room does not have double glasing so the noice from the traffic and the airplanes is very loud. I am a Club Carlsson member on consierge level and I expect a lot more than this from a Radisson. The ""fruit platter"" I was offered as a ""gift"" consisted of a couple of dried grapes, two strawberries and an apple, all served on a scruffy caffeteria type plate. No, this hotel is not living up to Radisson standard, but with the airport location I assume they don't have to make an effort. Next time I have to overnight at Dublin airport, I will stay at Bewleys.",2,2015,02,17
245,It is what it is,"This hotel doesn't make bold claims. If you are travelling in or out and need somewhere to stay for the night in comfort and have the security afforded by the free transfer service then look no further. Staff friendly, breakfast good and room both clean and comfortable. Gym off site.",4,2015,02,17
245,Before an early morning flight,"My daughter booked an over night before a very early morning flifgt and we joined her for dinner. The room was vey well presented and the staff friendly, especially in the dining room. The menu was simple but good and they catered for children, and they were made feel welcome. Overall a good experiance better than most airport hotels I have stayed in.",4,2015,02,15
245,No Problems.,"We stayed at this hotel for one night before a flight to Vegas. The hotel is a few minutes from the airport. We walked there, not realising that there is a shuttle bus provided by the hotel. Check in was prompt and hassle free. The room was spacious and clean. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant. The food was plentiful and the service was good. I would stay her again and would recommend Radisson Blu Hotel at Dublin Airport.",4,2015,02,14
245,The day room is just the cure for recovering from trans atlantic jet lag,"A days rest at this property helped disperse the malaise that always seems to accompany a trans atlantic case of jet lag.  The room (405?) was clean and well appointed.  The  only drawback worth mentioning is that I wish our room had not been next door to renovation work!  The noise, while not overwhelming, did disturb our sleep on a few occasions during the day that we stayed there.",4,2015,02,12
245,As good as usual,"My wife and I have stayed here several times when catching an early flight from Dublin. The room we had was up to the usual standard - well equipped, spacious and with a comfortable bed. An iron and board was delivered very soon after we requested it. There is even decaf coffee available in the room.
We ate in the T3 restaurant that evening and the food was great. The Cajun chicken pizza was large and very tasty, as was my burger. The Guinness was so good I was forced to sit in the quiet lounge area later and enjoy another pint. 
Since we were flying slightly later in the day we decided to have breakfast in the hotel, rather than at the airport. It cost an extra €17 on top of the room rate which was cheaper than 2 breakfasts in the airport. The coffee was served in an insulated flask so it stayed hot and the toaster produced perfect toast. There was a good range if hot and cold items available from the buffet breakfast, our only complaint was that some of the hot items (especially the scrambled eggs) were lukewarm. The sausage, bacon, pudding, etc were tasty and reasonably warm.
Would I stay here again? YES!! I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel because it's so close to the airport and their shuttle runs every 15 minutes.",4,2015,02,12
245,Great hotel for access to airport,Close proximity to airport makes this an ideal place to stay. Clean and comfortable with reasonable parking charges. Evening meal we had was good quality and well priced. Staff were friendly and efficient. A good overall experience.,4,2015,02,11
245,Good situation,"Booked a room in Radisson Blu Hotel before taking an early flight at Dublin Airport.
Check in at the reception was efficient, and personnel very friendly
Rooms are modern, bed confortable, but did not find how to set-up the temperature in the room.
Had dinner there : food was good, service organization can be further optimized.
WIFI is free, but was hard to make it work on my mbile : hopefully, the lady at the reception was very kind (and seemed to be IT freak :-) and finally managed to make it work.
I had a very early flight, but possibility to have some short breakfast in the lobby. Price around 120 euros for the night.",4,2015,02,08
245,Ok...,"Stayed here on a Thursday evening prior to flying out first thing next morning.
Was ok check in a touch slow, room was ok a little dated, bed was ok, pillows not that great.
Typical airport hotel, so didn't expect that much.
Didn't eat anything there so can't comment on the food.",3,2015,02,08
245,Great location for Airport ,"Great location ....i walked from the airport. ...one tip guys...publish the location of the shuttle bus pickup on your web site...spent 30 mins or more trying to work it out and gave up.
Nice rooms. ..yes some parts getting a bit dated but who cares...comfy....clean...warm....good service and the breakfast was excellent
",4,2015,02,06
245,Conference Stay,"Recently stayed at the hotel for a conference that was hosted within the hotel. Hotel was fine, bedroom good, breakfast great, conference facilities and dinner were ok. Staff were very friendly and did all they could to respond to requests. The hotel website says '.....Keep up with workout routines at the ALSAA Leisure Complex, a state-of-the-art facility with a swimming pool, saunas and fitness rooms.....' I assumed the Leisure complex was on site. It wasn't .... I didn't realise it was about 10 minute walk away through a system of busy roads but shuttle bus was offered. However, the journey in bus took about 25 mins. On the way we took passengers from hotel to one airport terminal then went to a different terminal to pick someone up, we then went to drop another guest to a swimming pool (separate to the gym) then went back to the hotel to drop the picked up passengers off before finally dropping me at gym- lesson, confirm the route to be taken before taking shuttle! The hotel needs to make clear that these facilities are off site as this is primarily a business hotel and people are often short of time.",3,2015,02,06
245,"Convenient location, but pricey","I booked the hotel primarily because I knew I would arrive very late and the shuttle bus is offered on a 24 hours basis.

I'm also Club Carlson gold, so some extra points and a potential upgrade were an extra incentive.

I think I got upgraded to a Business room and was given a drink voucher that I didn't feel like using considering that it was already fairly late at night. I was told I was guest of the day, but to be honest I didn't really understand what the meant. I found a congratulatory card and a small notebook on the bed... I was unsure if that was meant to be the welcome gift?

The hotel has no charm, the room is just fine. This hotel is expensive for what it is. Luckily I booked the room on a sale. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it.",4,2015,02,02
245,Waiting for a plane,"Flight cancelled and I had to stay at the airport. Incredibly efficient staff checked me in within 15 minutes . Room was great and functional, Alarm clock call system was brilliant but was not needed as the noise from every plane came through the windows from 5am. Lucky my flight was at 7 so I had to get up. Breakfast was great but not enough staff so everything took forever.",4,2015,01,31
245,Great Proximity to Airport,"We stayed at this hotel for one night prior to catching an early morning flight to Spain.  It's proximity to the airport and free shuttle service made it ideal for our purposes.  The rooms were modern and a similar size to North American airport hotels which was unexpected.  We arrived at 6:30 am and couldn't check in until later in the afternoon, so we checked our bags and took a 20 minute cab ride to the Temple Bar / Dublin Castle area.  The city has clear signage everywhere and was very walkable, so we only required a taxi to/from the hotel.  I'd recommend this hotel if you need to catch an early morning flight or are only going to stay in Dublin for a short duration.  If I was going to stay longer, I'd want to stay closer to city centre to avoid the need for public transportation.",3,2015,01,31
245,Handy for airport,Needed a handy hotel near Dublin airport. This place is right on the airport and run a free courteously bus every 10 mins or so. A grab and go 'breakfast' if you are in a rush. Nice power shower in my business room.,4,2015,01,30
245,Good comfortable stay!,"A comfortable stay, breakfast was delicious - served buffet style with hot and cold foods. A free shuttle runs to airport every (I think) 15 mins. The hotel decor is modern and the staff are very helpful and friendly. Our room was comfortable, clean and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed our stay!",5,2015,01,30
245,Good Location but tired and dark,"Reception:

Not very fast at either check in or check out - given its an airport hotel you expect a bit more urgency.

Bar area (to the left)

Very very dark and well worn - some modernisation but still gloomy area

Room:

Very basic could do more to modernise it - the desk is awful and feels like an 80s addition.

Overall:

Average - great location for the airport but well worn and needs a proper modernisation!",3,2015,01,30
245,within walking distance from Terminal 2,"Good value for money. Only - the gym is far away. Hence no chance of a workout after a lousy flight. Otherwise - for an airport hotel really good. 
Got a nice room with a great view over the airport. Funny watching planes landing while laying in bed. 
Not enough plugs for the number of devices a traveller does carry with him today.",3,2015,01,28
245,I will not be back,"I recently booked this hotel when returning on a late flight into Dublin. I paid more than I would for nearby hotels as I wanted a nice hotel and was confident that the Radisson group guaranteed a high standard of accomodation. 
My first impression was of an outdated decor and a generally shabby appearance. Our room was located on the first floor and the corridor was scruffy and dirty. Our room overlooked an untidy and bleak yard. The bathroom was old fashioned and contained hairs in the shower area. 
Having deposited our bags we headed to the bar for a nightcap only to be informed that the bar was closed(11.45pm Friday night). We were requested to sit in the foyer and wait for someone to serve us. 
Broadband could not be accessed through settings. It could be accessed through the hotel website but one had to go to reception to find this out. 
The room was very noisy. Traffic noise was clearly audible even with the window closed. Worse still was the noise from a lorry collecting laundry early on Saturday morning. 
Staff did try to address my concerns by offering to move our room and we were given a free drink. However this was very late in the evening and seemed too little too late. 
The hotel was not very busy and I do not understand why this room was allocated given its poor location, noise levels and the very poor state of the corridor area. 
I was very disappointed with the whole experience. Surely each guest should be offered the best room available and not have to complain in order to be offered an adequate room. I really feel that The Radisson chain of hotels have left me down. 
",1,2015,01,27
245,Home from home.,"We use this hotel every year for the airport fire officers association conference. The hotel has recently spent load of money on the rooms and a beds are fantastic. 

The staff are helpful polite and will do anything for you, nothing is too much trouble. This was our 14th conference here and long may we continue. 

The food in the bar and restaurants was top end and very reasonably priced 

Many thanks for a perfect stay

I hope we see you next year 

Peter Martin
",5,2015,01,25
245,Excellent customer Service,"I stayed as a delegate attending a conference for 2 nights. This hotel was a perfect venue. There was over 100 of us for dinner and the quality of the food was very good considering the numbers involved.

Where this hotel stands out head and shoulders above the rest is their staff. I had a number of very positive interactions with them. They were friendly and very helpful.

Would recommend this hotel.",5,2015,01,25
245,Location!,"Generally when it comes to airport hotels one doesn't have much of a choice. Radisson is the closest one (5 minutes walk to the T2), so you tend to be forgiving with regard to other factors people normally consider choosing their accommodation. The hotel is big and usually crowded, so it is difficult to entertain any kind of personal touch. Not uncommon are lines to the reception desks so do not expect check-ins/check-outs being always speedy process. Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, breakfasts sumptuous - yet the price is somewhere near excessive. Also: normally one would expect a swimming pool on site from a four star hotel.",4,2015,01,24
245,"An hotel, nothing more...","I booked a bedroom at the Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport as the price was pretty good.

I finally arrived to take my bedroom, but I had to wait for more than 12 mins as there was only one employee at the front desk. The staff is friendly and they try to make you comfortable and at ease.

There is a fridge in the bedroom, it's empty and a bit dirty. Turning on the light of the room made me mad as there is something going wrong between the lights next to the bed and the lights near the desk and the window.

The bathroom is common and the fan is noisy as hell... Good luck for opening the package of the soap, I thought I was playing a role in a sitcom, the most hilarious night at this hotel.

Finally, the bedroom next to mine had great fun late in the night and early in the morning, you can hear everything even if you don't want to.

The windows are thin so you can hear the cars outside in the morning or in the evening. If you need some sparkling water you have to wait for about 20 mins, as during the night they have no stock available at the front desk, they have to use the lift then get some bottles... By the way, it was not a bottle fully sealed, looks like they filled themselves the bottle as there is no label nor brand on the front of the bottle...

It's very close to the airport, and too far away from everything else.

Anyway, strange experience at the Radisson, not sure if they want to ensure that their customer have a memorable experience, but mine was seriously hilarious...",3,2015,01,22
245,"Convenient, but run down","Convenient, walking distance to the airport. Rooms and general hotel a bit outdated and run down even though some minor improvements have been done over the last year. Room was ice cold and no thermostat to adjust temperature. Friendly staff, decent menu that could be updated a bit more frequently.",3,2015,01,18
245,Summer2014,"We arrived back in Dublin early from Scotland and wanted an airport location.  The shuttle was a bonus as it took us to buses located at the airport.  We were able to go see Mallahide Castle and Gardens before leaving and had a day to relax.  
The hotel offered an upgrade for a price but was worth it to us.  The room was spacious and very quiet, although we felt it was outdated.  
The breakfast was very good with what was left before finally being replenished, as it was crowded with rude teenage athletes from Sweden, piling food on plates, pushing and shoving at other guests.",3,2015,01,14
245,Friendly staff and good location.,"The staff at this hotel, check in, courtesy driver and bar staff and helpful and very friendly.  This is one of the closest hotels to the terminals and the courtesy service is very prompt. 
The rooms are reasonable by the standards of most European airport hotels, the rooms are quiet and comfortable.  I tried rooms on the 4th and 5th floors over the last week and both were quiet, my only slight reservation is that some of the rooms are a little tired and could do with a refresh.",4,2015,01,14
245,Find another hotel close to Dublin Airport,"Although this hotel is very convenient and close to the Dublin airport, I would advise others to look for other hotels in the area.  The toilet would not flush and the service in the restraunt was very slow (both times).",2,2015,01,12
245,For One Night Only!,"For convenience to Dublin airport you can’t go wrong - you’ll walk to the terminal in about 5 minutes, otherwise the hotel offer a pretty frequent shuttle service. The bar and restaurant area in the hotel is modern and has everything you need. Once you take the elevator to the rooms everything starts to  a get little grubby  and old. The dark corridor to the rooms had a few ceiling plates missing and lacked any kind of positive atmosphere. Like everything above the ground floor, the rooms too are in need of modernisation and a real good clean (as the attached images show). We only stayed one night, which I guess will be the case for most people, and for the price paid and convenience to the airport it was worth it.",3,2015,01,11
245,Grand but ...,"En route to Spain. Only waiting 12 mins for shuttle bus, but enough to get very very cold! Nearly phoned for speedier pick up but along came bus. Lovely reception and nice looking room. Great view of terminal 2 at night! Walking distance for sure. Room very cold. Rad just about on. Dinner grand and reasonable. Bottle pinot 20 euro. Happy days BUT a bacardi and coke for 8.35 and a pint of guiness for 5.40? No thanks. Way way to ordinary!",3,2015,01,10
245,Low Quality airport stay,"This Radisson gives a bad name to the Radisson Blu Chain.It is understaffed and needs refurbishment of bedrooms.It is no good for airport stay,better to take city hotel that is not too far from airport. This hotel needs to be managed better with new products and service that are passenger friendly.competition will put this hotel out of business.",2,2015,01,09
245,Great Service,I was welcomed properly and received the guest of the day title. I was sent an amenity to my room and had a complimentary drink also. The accommodation was clean and the staff were friendly and eager to please.,5,2015,01,09
245,Good facilities and service,"I used their meeting rooms for a day in January.  We were looked after by Emma who was very obliging and when we asked for extras, there was nothing but a high level of professionalism.
One are to improve was general stains on the carpet - however all else was spotless.",4,2015,01,08
245,Lower your expectations for this Radisson,"Honestly, I was truly disappointed in this Radisson facitialiy. Had the hotel not been purchased on points I would have put a huge fuss at the check in counter.  I booked a room for a family of 4 and  in my reservation it said 2 queen beds.  What we got was a 1 queen bed and a fold out couch that was so uncomfortable my husband and I ended up sleeping on the couch cushions on the floor.  We were up till 2am due to loud neighbors (after asking check in to give us a quiet room due to traveling with the toddlers).  The only reason this hotel is getting 2 stars is because after complaining about the noise level in our room and not being able to sleep they gave us a late check out.  I couldn't even comment on the breakfast even though we paid for it because only 2 ppl in my party of 4 used it since we were too exhausted to even make it down.  Unless you are single or traveling in 1 companion I would not recommend this hotel ever!",2,2015,01,08
245,Fair,"Stayed here before a flight and left the car in their car park, €115 for one night and four nights parking, ok I suppose.
The rooms were large but the beds were small and the shower fluctuated between hot and cold. The restaurant has a good reasonable menu but not enough seating.
We left the hotel at about 8:30 but there was no complementary ""grab and go"" breakfast left.
Also, we were waiting over 30 minutes on our return to be brought back to the hotel.",3,2015,01,07
245,Promise more then it can live up to,Good location for travelers. No gym in the hotel and the one offered in facility near by was very poor. This is clearly a one night hotel to get some sleep before catching the next flight. Have only good experience staying with Radisson but not this time :-),2,2015,01,07
245,Avoid T3,"Rude staff, slow service, all round rubbish experience. Staff had no idea about the menu and simply didn't care if the info they gave was correct or not, supposedly hot wraps served cold and cold again after being asked to heat them. In Ireland and on the menu chips are hot, deep fried potatoes, not doritos especially when you have checked with the staff. Bringing one glass of water with a jug of water to table of 10 people, really? Wandering off in the middle of taking an order because you got a funny text.... The service did improve slightly when the staff changed. Although saying that a table next to us was left uncleared for 2 hours. The food was ok in general, but mostly not as described. If you have the option just eat in the Airport!",2,2015,01,07
245,Not a great stay,"My husband has booked the Maldron/Clarion for many years without complaint when we have needed an overnight airport stay in Dublin. This time I found a deal that was 15 euros cheaper at the Radisson so decided to give them a try. Our first issue with the room (517) was that is smelt of body odour. The second was with the shower- the overhead rose was broken so a hand held spray unit had been attached lower down the wall, great height if you are a dwarf but unfortunately neither myself or my husband are. Even more irritating than this was that the water stopped flowing completely part way through my shower whilst I was shampooing my hair. I had to come out of the bathroom dripping wet to call the reception who responded in way that one can assume this must happen frequently. I was informed to wait a while for a staff member reset the boiler. After finishing up my shower which took longer than anticipated due to the interruption and having to wash out shampoo with the hand held low pressure sprayer my husband and I were in a rush to check out. Once we were checked in for our flight at the airport we sat down and noticed we had been charged a15 euro 'tip' from our dinner the night before. I do not recall reading anything on the hotel restaurant (T3) menus about any compulsory tip so found this to be very cheeky to add this on to our bill. I fail to see what service we were actually 'tipping' for as after our meal my husband and I physically got up and went to the bar to order subsequent drinks as no staff member came to our table to see if would like more. A poor experience at the Radisson and we won't be returning.",2,2015,01,04
245,So close to the airport....,"This hotel is very close to the terminal (5 minutes) and it operates a free shuttle bus service to and from the airport.  Due to it's close proximity, it is noisy outside until the planes stop taking off! Parking is available on site for hotel residents.

Check in was quick and is after 2pm from the main reception area.  From here you can access  the bar & restaurant which both serve food in the evening. Two lifts operate to all floors which were quite speedy.  Express checkout is available and rooms are vacated before 12 noon.

The main bar was large with big TVs available and got very busy. Pre- booking a table is a good idea! The menu was limited and typical of ""bar food"" but was good quality and served promptly. Breakfast was self service serving both hot & cold food in a continental or ""full English"" style. Food was replenished regularly and all the staff were friendly.

Room 501 was a top floor, corner room (business) with views across the airport and surrounding areas. Facilities included: satellite TV, tea / coffee tray, iron & board, trouser press, hairdryer & minibar. 

Free Wi-Fi was provided in the room via a website login. The bathroom was small but functional with both a bath & shower.

This hotel is great for easy access to the airport & surrounding areas.",5,2015,01,04
245,Decent stay - but don't get your expectations up.,"Location is really good and the free shuttle service is always a plus.
The room I stayed in was in need of some refurbishment as the furniture seemed a bit out of date but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean.

The service from the reception staff was decent, as I didn't have my Club Carlson card on me, I asked the girl at reception if she could retreive my Club Carlson card number via my email adress as all other hotels usually can, but she informed me that she did not have the authorised access as she was not a supervisor - and asked me if I could email her the Club Carlson number instead of her checking with her supervisor later and adding my card to my booking. 
It's not a major issue but I believe that the service can be improved. 

Breakfast was decent but nothing special.",3,2015,01,03
245,DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL,"Myself and my wife booked this hotel as we arrived back from New York in the early hours of the morning and had a long wait until an afternoon flight. The idea was just to have some sleep.

Firstly, the rooms that hasn't had anything done to them like ours are horrendous. We opened the door to the room and were shocked that the old 100 year old furniture was falling apart, the bed and mattress were awful and so uncomfortable, we had no bin in the room or bathroom, big balls of people's hair all over the floor and a quarter inch gap around the window therefore allowing wind to come through it and make a racket!

Why didn't I ask to be changed or leave, the ONLY reason was we checked in at 4.30am in the morning after a long flight and were desperate to just try and sleep. Any other time we would of left straight away.

So overall the worst hotel room we have ever stayed in full stop. I would be annoyed paying £35 a night for this room so the fact my bill is 120 euros for the night is crazy.

You have been warned, I am guessing the positive reviews on this site are from refurbished rooms as nobody is daft enough to think the old rooms are sufficient.",1,2015,01,02
245,Flying out the next morning,This is a great hotel close to Terminal  2. The food and drink in the bar is expensive but typical for an airport hotel. This is the best airport hotel; others are cheaper but don't have the same amenities ,4,2015,01,01
245,Slow service,"I work nearby and have tried the hotel for coffee and scones a few times usually between 10:00 & 12:00. Service was always too slow, it's annoying having to go ask for and order to be told ""we will come down to you"". Not ideal for anyone in a hurry but this would be a good venue for informal meetings in the hotel lounge.",2,2014,12,31
245,Perfect for an airport stay,"Couldn't have been happier with our stay here.  The room was clean, beds were very comfortable, great modern facilities, an inviting chic lounge area, and the staff very helpful.  The free airport shuttle is a lovely bonus and we really appreciated being able to print our boarding passes in the lobby.  A perfect choice for a short stay before or after a flight and within walking distance of Terminal 1.  We would not hesitate to return again.",4,2014,12,30
245,Great Hotel for Dublin Airport,"Like most other contributors, I used this hotel for its proximity to the airport...indeed, it is one of the few hotels which are actually located within the airport perimeter!  My room was very comfortable...six stars for the quality of the mattress.  I had stayed at this Radisson on an earlier occasion and I remembered that the steaks on the bar menu were particularly mouthwatering and very good value, so I treated myself to one again...delicious!  This hotel is quite expensive in comparison to other nearby facilities, but it is worth it if you want a little pampering.",5,2014,12,28
245,Great for the airport,"Chose this hotel for its proximity to Dublin airport and my very early flight.
Easy check in and the room was lovely - 5th floor and a nice view if the terminal
 Ordered room service - food was fine and the service efficient.

Check out simple and the take away coffee etc in reception was welcome.

The shuttle bus was great and free!

Would certainly stay there again if travelling early from Dublin.",4,2014,12,27
245,Close Proximity to Dublin's Airport,"We chose this property for our last night's stay in Ireland as we were catching an early morning flight back to the US.  We booked a standard room using points so could not complain about the cost.  

The pluses - This hotel is located next to the airport and is great for the free shuttle.  The gentleman who operated it on our arrival date was friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful with any and all questions being answered.  The shuttle was a nice bonus - we used it the day of our arrival to get to the airport and take the bus back into Dublin to finish up some sightseeing and shopping.  All staff we came in contact with were pleasant.  We did not dine in the restaurants, choosing to eat in Dublin the evening before our departure.  The lobby was clean as well as our room.  

The negatives - As others have noted, we too had a room that was extremely warm.  We called and reported the problem, the gentleman who came in turned off the air.  He advised us that there were no rooms to upgrade to and opened our windows.  As it was April, this helped a bit.  We did not notice any airport noise - we were too tired at that point.  The room was clean but really needed to be updated.  The bathroom tub drained VERY slowly. 

Simply put, this hotel was chosen for location.  It was adequate for an overnight stay but would not consider staying here for any other reason except that.  Kudos to the hotel for it's staff!",3,2014,12,26
245,Just what you need,"We were checked in promptly and efficiently by Mable. We were in 518 at the front of the hotel. We could hardly hear the planes overhead. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Terrible pillows in our opinion.

The bathroom had a shower over bath. The water was fine, pressure a bit lacking. Toiletries provided were fine too.

Breakfast was abundant and really well presented. They even had gluten free bread for me with no extra fuss. 

Friendly, courteous staff throughout. We will certainly be back. ",4,2014,12,25
245,vastly improved.,continued improvements have turned this into a nice hotel. apparently there are new mattresses which made sleep much more comfortable and restful. television reception much improved. internet reliable and fast. ate in the restaurant and the food was very good. staff pleasant and helpful. frequent  and convenient shuttle to the airport which is a stone's throw away. new paint has brightened up the appearance and  given  the hotel a fresh and clean appearance.,5,2014,12,22
245,Ticks all boxes,"We stayed at radisson Dublin airport prior to a recent early morning flight. Checked into business class interconnecting rooms. Rooms were spotless and comfortable cute welcome pack of mini bottle red wine and pringles. 
We ate in Kealys bar restaurant next to hotel. Early departure at 5am was eased by a buffet take and go breakfast outside the lifts in reception. A nice touch for rushing travellers. Well done radisson.",4,2014,12,22
245,Not just for the airport. ,"I have stayed in this hotel twice in the past month, using the hotel as a base for visiting Beaumont Hospital. Ideally located just ten minutes drive, the Radisson provided an oasis of calm !

The basics are all a given, the rooms are spotlessly less clean, check in and out both ver efficient. What makes this property shine above its competitors is the willingness of its staff to go the extra mile to get the job done. 

Good selection of food available throughout the day, with the carvers lunch selected on both visits. Good selection to suit all tastes. 

All in all a great guest experience. ",5,2014,12,20
245,Looking shabby and breakfast was disappointing,Stayed here the night before flying out from the airport. Was disappointed with the quality of the room as the furniture was shabby and worn. Have stayed in Radisson before that were much better quality than this. The breakfast was luke warm in the trays and lacking in flavour and quality.  Not great at all for the price. Staff also seemed unhappy and under pressure. Shame though. Didn't feel like I was in a Radisson at all and certainly didn't live up to the price we paid either!,3,2014,12,20
245,Ideal,"We have used this hotel now for a number of overnight stays whilst using Dublin as a starting point for holidays in the sun. The fact that it is close to the airport and that it has an excellent system of transportation to both terminals makes it a particularly attractive prospect. There is a very good bar/restaurant serving a wide selection of Irish-based fare. The rooms are spacious and the beds very comfortable and, despite the proximity of the main runway, aircraft noise is not too much of an intrusion. With staff who are friendly and helpful, free wi-fi for Club Carlson members and rates which do not exceed expectations, we will continue to use the facility and to recommend.",5,2014,12,19
245,Tatty and poorly maintained room - a poor advert for Radisson,"Room 118:  curtains falling off track, drawer fronts dropping off, nasty stains on the sofa, a chair with that sinking problem upholstery problem, disgusting collection of micro-flora in the drain section inside the fridge, broken lid on the kettle, sealant coming away on the bath...
This room is distinctly unloved and needs someone from the management to look at it from the guest's point of view.  Deeply unimpressed.  I have stayed in better rooms in this hotel, so why the diversity in standards?  Probably won't choose this Radisson again.",2,2014,12,17
245,Excellent stay for one night,"I was stuck in Dublin Airport and my sister kindly book a room for me urgently,within less than 10 minutes it was all sorted.The complimentary shutte from Terminal 1 takes 5 mins and the reception were very helpful.Room service was prompt and the room very comfortable indeed.The early morning call was done without fuss and it was great having complimentary hot/cold drinks fruits whilst waiting for the bus which is frequent at every 15 minutes.",5,2014,12,14
245,Business Trip - Bad combination of events,Nice hotel rooms comfortable and well presented. Location great for taking a flight.  Had confusion about time wakeup call and  breakfast which was ordered to the room. Didn't get either but mix ups can happen.  We had no hot water on the day in my room or my  colleagues. So no shower available. Stayed before and first time this happened to be fair.  Myself and colleague mentioned to reception and told no one else complaining about no hot water and we didn't book breakfast at our intended time. Basically two of us were wrong and he was right. He was having a bad morning maybe.  Anyway Office Supervisor called later was excellent & refunded charge for breakfast.  having said all that would stay again,4,2014,12,12
245,Radisson before Christmas,"I'm a great fan of Radisson and stay very often in various Radisson Hotels in Europe. This time the experience was unfortunately negative because the room was cold and there was no heating working, nor had the Hotel any heater available. The room had been left to freeze because someone left the windows open in order to put on the Christmas decorations on the balcony, but just left them there and didn't close the window. As the heating was not working the room never recovered a suitable temperature. The reception employees were nice but clueless of what to do, so couldn't help. It's my 1st negative experience in the Radisson over many times.",4,2014,12,10
245,"Nice hotel, very convenient","Stayed for 1 night before an early morning flight.  Check in was quick and effiecient.  The room was a nice size.  Good comfortable bed and nice amenities in the bathroom.  The TV reception was fuzzy on almost all the channels.

In the morning there was tea and coffee as well as juice and water in reception and the shuttle bus was there to take you to the airport.

Would stay again for next trip out of Dublin.",4,2014,12,09
245,One night stay,Hotel within walking distance from airport terminal. Frequent shuttle if you have too much luggage to walk. Friendly staff. Good rooms and quiet. Bar food menu is good and available till late. Relatively quick and painless check in / out. Would recommend hotel,5,2014,12,08
245,Waiting for the plane,"I went with my family the day previous to my flight and had a great experience dinning, having a beer and enjoying a wonderful breakfast. Free wifi, upgrade for 30 euros and very proffessional employees.",4,2014,12,04
245,Handy location,"I stay here when I have a 5 or 6 AM flight the next morning.  Rooms are fine, restaurant is adequate.  Can't comment on breakfast, I'm already flying by then :)  Normally prompt check-in, I'd recommend you do early checkout if you have an early flight.  Wifi works with no issues, very stable and easy connection.  Shuttle bus is fine - but frequently it's even faster and easier to simply walk from the hotel to the airport terminal (only 5 minutes) - quite workable if you have a suitcase with rollers and there is minimal rain.",4,2014,12,03
245,Great night,Stayed overnight before flying out from the airport in the early hours.  Hotel provides a shuttle bus service between hotel and airport every 15 minutes.  Leavers snacks were provided which was a great bonus.  Room was clean and well sized.  The room was also well sound insulated.  Staff really friendly.,4,2014,12,01
245,Good experience,GOverall good experience for 2 nights.  Good location just next to airport and nice food. Taxi service to reach city is also quick and good. Breakfast  is normal and could have more options.         Rooms are clean and good in size. I surely suggest the same to stay nearby Dublin city.,3,2014,11,29
245,Enjoyable Stay,"Stayed here the night before heading on a long haul flight. Used the shuttle bus which was prompt and drivers friendly. Check in staff were lovely and when I mentioned that we were actually heading off on our honeymoon the following day they upgraded us to a business class room. Room was lovely, and about 10 minutes after we were settled there was a knock on the door and we were presented with two slices of cake with congratulations written in chocolate sauce on the plate. Such a kind gesture, we really appreciated it! We ate in the bar that night and the food was really good and the staff were really chatty and friendly.
Overall I think this place is excellent value for money and the staff go the extra mile which is what makes a hotel special. We will definitely be back.",5,2014,11,28
245,functional but a bit run down,"if you need to catch an early flight, this hotel is convenient, The building and rooms are a bit worn out, but wifi is working well, reception staff is friendly. The hotel does have an excellent restaurant. And of course, be aware of the noise of the planes (it is an airport hotel after all. About 20 minutes by taxi to city centre",3,2014,11,27
245,Good Hotel,"Stayed here overnight and requested a runway view room which was granted, as my son loves to watching the planes.

We ate in the restaurant at night before 6 as it was cheaper and had breakfast too.  Both meals were good.

There is a machine at the reception to print of your boarding card if needed.

I would return.",5,2014,11,25
245,"Great service, fair price","Exactly what you want at the airport; friendly service; quick check in and check out, nice rooms and a fair price. Good internet available throughout hotel and plenty of room to work in the rooms with nice desk. All together a very enjoyable experience",4,2014,11,25
245,Great fo an arport ovenight,"Very close to airport so was ideal for an early flight. Check in was seamless and desk staff were local and very friendly and accommodating, when they heard we were there to celebrate my husbands birthday they sent up cheesecake which was a lovely well appreciated touch. Couldn't fault it at all and would use again.   As we were leaving at 5am we didn't choose the breakfast option although on checkout there was tea coffee and fruit if you wanted some.",4,2014,11,25
245,Could be so much better,"The Radisson Blu Dublin Airport is the perfect location for overnight stays prior to and after flights and could e superb. Unfortunately, the bed was too hard, the duvet was too heavy/hot, the pillow was flat as a door, the window didn't open sufficiently to provide fresh air, and hopefully the atrocious air freshener that was in our room was a ""one off"" occurrence.  People staying at an airport hotel really do look forward to/need a good night's rest and the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport could actually be that hotel without too much effort.",3,2014,11,25
245,Really good value for money ,"I've stayed here twice now and my return to this hotel was just as pleasant as it was the first time. The staff were great and they gave us an early check in upon arrival. 

Great value for money, good location - the airport is a 5 minute walk away, regular shuttle buses and you're rarely waiting for one and a lovely restaurant inside the hotel. 

The room was spacious and clean, the bed was extremely comfortable - the memory foam mattress may have helped, and there were free towels and some toiletries included too. 

The staff were friendly and really helpful and they were happy to do as much for us as they could. 

The restaurant was nice too, we had some lovely food on our last night there. 

I would recommend the hotel to anyone going to Dublin and I would return here happily and will do soon. 
",4,2014,11,23
245,Good staff and welcoming room,"I was pretty jet lagged after my Aer Lingus flight and this hotel was just a few minutes walk from the airport. I was in a real state as Aer Lingus forgot my luggage in Chicago but glad I always carry a change of clothes. The Checkin staff noticed I didn't feel too well and I was able to sit on the couch while checkin was completed. Trust me, I was really wiped out and exhausted. 

The hotel was sold out and they did locate my reservation. I was given a handicap room, which I had no issues.

The room was nice and I couldn't find anything out of place. I was able to take the shuttle bus back to the airport to catch a bus into the city for the day as my next flight to London was next morning. The shuttle drivers are very nice and I had a few good conversations. 

I was able to partake of GE free buffet breakfast the next morning which was a nice touch. I was starving and e buffet did not disappoint.

Overall I enjoyed my stay, the rate was good, and the staff professional.",5,2014,11,20
245,Early flight,"I recently stayed here with my kids before we flew to Florida. We had to check in at the airport at  6.20 which meant we would of had to leave Galway way too early, and as we didn't have a direct flight it was great to have a good nights sleep here the night before.

We got the bus from Galway to Dublin and once we got off the bus the driver showed us where the bus stop for the hotel was, only a 2 minute walk. After 5 minutes a shuttle bus picked us up and dropped us to the hotel. A bus leaves every 15 minutes but if you don't want to wait there is a phone number at the bus shelter and you can call the hotel and ask for the shuttle to pick you up.

Check in was fast and when we got to the room the beds were already made. (Sofa bed had been turned into a bed) we had 2 single beds and a double sofa bed. We had a view of the airport, I was a little worried about the noise but it was fine and we slept great.

Best part was not having to wake up early (like we usually do when travelling) as the airport is right across from the hotel. We were too early for breakfast but there was a free grab n go breakfast at the reception area, with fruit, water, tea, coffee etc.

Shuttle bus picked us up from the front of the hotel and dropped us off at the departures area. If we have an early flight again I will definatly stay here again.",5,2014,11,19
245,Not bad for airport hotel - here on business.,"Stayed here several times and as far as airport hotels go it not bad!. Staff are friendly and you can walk to the hotel easily in 10 min. Also OK to sit and have coffee and do business during the day, coffee is not bad. Restaurant is OK. Food was also OK, had burger last time - good, had ribs this time, bit tougher than I would have liked but OK. Stayed here as couldn't be bothered going into Dublin and its easy to get to when you fly in. Room was fine and clean. Would stay again.",3,2014,11,18
245,The best choice,"Yes, it may be an ""airport"" hotel but it's the staff that make the stay memorable since I don't spend much time in my room. From the front desk staff, to Pat who drives the convvenient airport shuttle van, to Martin and ""mini Martin"" in the T3 bar/restaurant, these lovely people make this hotel the best choice. Not only did I sleep well both times I've stayed here, in October and November, I was also able to talk with people at the bar from all over the world who had just arrived or were leaving the next day. The food I ate went well with the pints I enjoyed thanks to Martin's attentiveness. I felt like I was back home with friends in the USA my favorite Irish pub. This hotel and its bar have also become one of my favorites and I will stay there again when I return. Stay there, leave your room and head down to T3 bar for the evening, you will have a better experience and see that this hotel is more than just an place to sleep.",5,2014,11,18
245,Good hotel for an airport hotel,"Let's face it no one looks forward to a stay in an airport hotel,  it's serving a purpose of being near the airport with showers,  bed and food.  This does that. 

The place feels like a giant waiting room but the staff do their best to make your stay good.  Friendlyvwelcomes,  fast smiling service in restaurant and bar. 

Shuttle bus every 15 mins is great, I opted for the 1 night stay with 3 day parking.  Good value at €133 for 2.

Had the sharing platter with chicken wings, spring roles etc in the bar wish I hadn't! 

Grab n go free breakfast was handy although lids for the coffee cups would mean you could actually bring them on the go!!

If you are staying here,  enjoy whatever you have planned for the morning after :-)
",3,2014,11,17
245,Okay if you must sleep at airport,"Finding the place for the shuttle was a bit of a challenge especially in the pouring rain, but once there it came fairly fast. The room was okay, except for one of the sockets hanging out of the wall. The shower initially looked great, with both a ceiling mounted rainforest shower as well as a hand held one. When using however the upper one was wimpy, and whilst the hand held one was wonderfully powerful, the wall mounting meant it sprayed only horizontally thus soaking the whole bathroom. The bar/restaurant was okay, decent choice of both food and beers. The hotel was overall just very sterile/boring. Fine for a quick sleep before an early flight, but beyond that would not really recommend.",2,2014,11,16
245,Waste of time and money!,"I booked a day room for this morning on flying in from the USA to grab a few hours sleep before an afternoon flight home to Scotland. Waste of time and of 80 Euros. I wouldn't have minded if I managed to get some sleep but cleaners knocking about in the rooms around us offered no chance of sleep and the room was also too hot with no air conditioning. Cramped bathroom also with your face 2 inches from the wall when on the toilet! In all, a shocking experience, ended up in the room for only 3 hours and paid 80 euros..... Rip off!",1,2014,11,16
245,Great place to stay.  The place where I treat myself,"While located within minutes of the Dublin airport there is no airport noise that I noticed.  Typically I return my rental car in the night before my departure, take their shuttle to the Radisson Blu and then take their shuttle to the international terminal in the morning. Easy and stress free.  Love the hotel, one of my favorites.  This is the hotel I spoil myself at.  I always stay here when I visit Ireland.",5,2014,11,16
245,OK but not great,"This hotel is most convenient for the airport with a frequent shuttle service to the terminal, but if you have just a carry bag it is only a few hundred meters to walk. I stayed here just one night in October and the hotel has not changed much in the five years since I last visited. The rooms are basic and dated, especially the bathrooms with the 1970's sanitary ware. I needed to have the window open all night to get the room temperature down and the traffic noise was disturbing. The breakfast is OK but not above average. Hotel rate is quite pricey but I guess the proximity to the airport comes at a price.",3,2014,11,15
245,Dublin airport,"I stayed at Radisson Dublin airport before an early morning flight.  The hotel staff was extremely helpful and nice.  I ate dinner at the restaurant. Again, the service was great.  Food was decent, not great, but there are not many other convenient options. I will definately stay here the next time I am in a similar situation.",4,2014,11,14
245,Best of the airport hotels,"On check in I was given a free upgrade to a business class room that had a Nespresso machine and a free bottle of water.  Free wifi was good.  I had to leave too early for breakfast, but there was fruit, coffee, bottles of water etc available in the reception area.  I hate paying for parking in a hotel, but at €7.50 for the night it was better than the 'other' airport hotel across the road.
Check in and check out were easy and quick.  
All in all if I needed an hotel at Dublin airport this is the one I would choose.",4,2014,11,12
245,good option for early morning flight,"Although only 5-10 minutes walk from the terminal buildings it is easier to jump on th frequent free bus that picks up just outside terminal. Check in was quick and friendly and allocated a business class room. Room was very large with king bed work table and sofa. Bathroom was large and well laid out. Room had air conditioning which was useful. I slept well and woke in time for early transfer to airport.  Did exactly what I wanted, easy to get to, a nice room, decent restaurant, good bed and easy stress free transfer back to airport. I would definitely stay there again",4,2014,11,11
245,"Warm welcome, great accommodation, great location and price - what more could you want","This is not my first time staying here and it has always been good. It is, in my opinion, the closest hotel to the Dublin Airport Terminals and just a short walk if you need a walk however the bust goes every 15 minutes also. The check in and out is swift and cheery and the staff are professional. The rooms on the fourth floor where I stayed are excellent and seem to have been recently refurbished. The bar and bar food is above the ordinary and with reasonable prices. I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2014,11,10
245,Massive improvement in restaurant T3 since my last stay,"Previously I have said you should try to eat elsewhere - but I arrived late, the airport was closed and so, very hungry, I went to T3 before I even went to my room.  I decided to go with the special - a lasagna,  a side salad & chips.  OK - not terribly healthy, but I hadn't eaten a proper meal all day :-).  The service was quick, friendly and the food was pretty good.  It's not gastro heaven, but the lasagna was well cooked, the salad had a good amount of dressing and the chips were thick, crispy outside and soft inside.  The room was comfortable as ever, though I barely stayed in it before my early shuttle.  I really like their lobby offer of free apples, cereal bars and coffee for those of us out before breakfast.  Well done, Radisson Blu - keep it up :-)",4,2014,11,10
245,Great hotel airport,"I was booked into this hotel on a business trip as I needed somewhere accessible to stay, after injuring myself in Dublin and requiring a wheelchair to get around. I was in a wheelchair accessible room and it was great - lots of space, easy to get around, very comfortable. I was most impressed with how friendly and super helpful all the staff were. Particularly Joanne at the front desk, who liased with the Airport accessibility support people, organising for transport to the airport and assistance there. The hotel was comfortable and pretty modern. A taxi into town is about 20 euros. There wifi is free but a tad slow, and requires regular re-authentication. For a business stay or for a stay close to the airport I'd highly recommend it",5,2014,11,10
245,Average ,"Nice hotel, clean rooms and general public areas. Nice bar and restaurant but we didn't eat there so I can't score it. Staff seemed friendly enough. Perfect location if you're flying out from Dublin airport. If you're planning on going to the city it's €30 in a taxi one way. We ordered breakfast to the room for €19 each. It was poor to say the least. And the milk delivered with the tea/coffee was UHT milk not fresh. If you're parking your there it's €12 per day. ",3,2014,11,09
245,Convenient location for early flights,"If you have to catch an early flight out, this is the hotel for you. It has a kiosk in the lobby and computers with printers to printout your boarding pass after you check in for your flight. This is helpful for RyanAir flights that want you to do so 24 hours ahead of time. It isn't too far from the city. We took a taxi into downtown for around 20 euro. Rooms were comfortable and what would you expect for a Radisson coming from the States.",4,2014,11,06
245,Long Weekend Stay,"Great hotel for a weekend stay. We had booked only for bed and breakfast which had a good breakfast buffet. The white pudding - magic. Bedrooms ideal size and very clean. The bar staff where excellent and always friendly. A bus into the centre of Dublin took approx 40mins - 10 Euro return or the easiest is a 20 minute cab journey approx -  25 Euro return plus you get the craic from the cab drivers and if your lucky a singing cab driver. 

No complaints - would recommend it.",5,2014,11,05
245,Convenient transportation center,"If you choose you can easily walk to and from the airport from here.  Be advised that the trip from the airport is a downhill venture on wide sidewalks with several street crossings.  These crossings are regulated by street crossing lights and is quite safe and my wife and I made it in about five minutes.  The hotel also offers free shuttle service to and from the airport leaving every fifteen minutes.  Room was large with a huge and comfortable bed.  Not as we'll appointed as some other hotels we've stayed in while on our Ireland holiday, but it more than makes up for it if you have to catch an early or late flight.  Staff was courteous and helpful and food in the restaurant was very good, although pricey.",4,2014,11,04
245,great for overnight stay,"My husband won an overnight stay at the hotel  so we took the opportunity to have a day in Dublin and the visit Kildare shopping village the next day. Had no great expectations from an airport hotel but was very clean, rooms spacious and surprisingly quiet from within hotel and only heard 1 plane when I opened the window! Staff very helpful. Cost £7.50 to park the car overnight...certainly cheaper than parking in Dublin. Bus from Airport to centre 10 Euro return each, taxi 20 - 25 euro which was our choice. Breakfast had everything I could think of on offer and good quality. Would certainly stay here again",5,2014,10,30
245,Very good stay,"I stayed here for a few days in October 2014. The hotel is very good, close to the airport if you are on a close schedule, but still not that close to be disturbing or noisy. On one side of the hotel you can even see airplanes taking off, but not quite hear them. The bed is very good, the right balance between soft and hard. The bath has a good selection of amenities, I liked the body lotion scented orange. The room is spacious, even has a generous desk for work. Dublin is close by a bus to the center. I also liked the breakfast, diverse, full, even the traditional Irish black pudding in the morning. All in all, a very good value for money near Dublin.",4,2014,10,30
245,It'll do...,"Booked through expedia and stayed here on return from holidays. Rang hotel from Zone 8 at 1:30am and they sent the driver straight away. Driver was nice. Check in was efficient. I'm a club carlsson member and got a free upgrade to a business class room. Bathroom was dirty enough and disappointing. Shower head needed changing. One towel was wet when we went in. Bed was comfortable, 5ft wide. Nespresso machine in place. Curtains wouldn't close fully and therefore couldn't black out the room. It was a stormy enough night and the wind was easily heard. Overall I was satisfied but the business class room in the Golden Lane Radisson is far superior and hence the reason for my average rating. Would stay here again - represented good value for money.",3,2014,10,28
245,Great for last night stay,"Stayed here our last night of a two week vacation for convenience. I needed a place to turn in the rental car and be ready for an early flight. I was amazed at how well the staff handled everything, from a full parking lot to helping with bags and transportation to the airport. The room was clean, spacious, and warm, with plenty of outlets to charge everything before heading home. The staff were most helpful, even allowed me to use one of their terminals to check in for my flights when the computers in the lobby would not connect to the Delta website. If you have an early flight at the end of your trip, this place can't be beat.",5,2014,10,28
245,Friendly Staff,Really enjoyed our 2 night stay in the Hotel. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The room was spotless. The car park attendant Robert noticed I left the window of my car open and covered it with a plastic in case it rained that night. Food was very good.,4,2014,10,28
245,Comfortable stay,"We upgraded to a business room and the room was spacious and comfortable, some nice touches likes a nespresso machine and mini bar available. The beds were comfy and the room was generally clean. 

We had to wait a little for the shuttle to the airport but I guess that is a minor thing and the wait was not so bad it upset our travel plans or schedule.

Would stay again if flying out of dublin.",4,2014,10,27
245,Radisson Blu Dublin Airport,We picked this hotel for the night after our holidays. We arrived into dublin airport at five past twelve sunday morning and we got to the hotel by twenty past. We where greater at reception with very friendly staff who told us we had been upgraded to a junior sweet. The room was amazing it was huge and so comfortable. We had a great stay here and we will definitely stay here again any time we arrive back.,5,2014,10,26
245,Its an Airport Hotel! - Enough said,"Though its about 35 minutes and quick cab ride to the city, we chose to stay at the airport after a driving holiday to grab the early morning flight back to the US.

They are many 70's style establishment with peeling plaster, dingy rooms advertising themselves as Airport hotels. I made the mistake before and found myself taking a 4 km cab ride to an 'airport' hotel. 

The Radisson Blue neon sign is visible from the terminal so I was reassured its an airport hotel. Thats exactly what it is.  An airport hotel- Busy reception, sparse rooms, printed room service menu, check-in booth in the lobby. Quick shuttle to the terminal. It works for me for that night before/after a long flight. 

Summary: If you are picky want luxury add ons, good toiletries, luxury linens, and smiling room service - look elsewhere. If you want a good clean place to stay at a modest cost and 5 minutes to the terminal. then this hotel works!",3,2014,10,22
245,All to be expected of a standard airport hotel.,"Arriving late from Gatwick was NOT pleased to find that the hotel does not have a pick-up point from both Terminals and was advised that it was a walk some way to next Terminal and was told shorter to walk to hotel.....which I did be it over several main roads....ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.
Check in was long and drawn out with long lines.
On booking I specifically requested (yes I know it's not guaranteed) for a top floor end of corridor room....did I get top floor?...NO....did I get end of corridor?...NO....was told 'well you are end of corridor!!!!'
Just a bog standard hotel room with the usual bits and pieces of furniture and a/c that didn't want to work.
The Duvets were so hot and heavy...quite vile in fact I guess they were pretty ancient.
I was only here for a few hours with an onward connection, so didn't get to use any of the facilities.",3,2014,10,22
245,Basic Expectations- Airport Hotel,"This hotel is a nice airport hotel.  Do not set your expectations higher than that.  Smells might be a little off.  The rooms are okay.  The fitness center is a bus ride away with limited hours and unimpressive.  Breakfast is not worth it.  The food is plentiful, but low quality.  The repeating elevator song did not help the situation.  Eat at the airport, which is very good even for an airport.",3,2014,10,21
245,"Close to Dublin airport, that is  the only good side","I chose this hotel because it was only minutes from the airport, and the only one available that day. I made a mistake. It is a grimy, dirty hotel. The staff are quite abrupt, lazy, and frankly rude. I checked in.  I arrived at the room.  It was dirty.  I called for a cleaning of the bathroom, no response.  I called for clean towels, no response.  I called for clean sheets, no response.  I walked to the linen room, retrieved towels, sheets and light  bulbs.  I even vacuumed the floor.  The vinyl windows were coated with mold.  It is the first time I have cleaned a hotel room upon arrival, I always clean up upon departure. I confronted the manager the following morning, she whined about the challenges of getting good staff, pathetic. A weak manager is a killer heart attack for any business.  I returned the vacuum cleaner.",1,2014,10,20
245,Ok,Ok hotel near Dublin Airport. Not the perfect location if you want to see the city of Dublin - you will need a car (we had one). The hotel is just ok...rooms are good in size and clean...could use renovation. Service was ok. No air conditioner in the rooms...,2,2014,10,19
245,Business,"I stayed in the Radisson Blue Hotel recently and my experience was very disappointing.
I arrived late on business and was checked into a room that was dirty and the bed had not been made.
The window was wide open as there was a horrible smell in the room.
There was empty bottles of water on the desk and a news paper thrown on the floor.
I contacted reception and was moved to another room.
In that room I found an empty box on the floor also.
This would leed me to believe the rooms are not being cleaned properly.
The shower area is clean but missing silicone & grout in tiles giving the appearence of being run down.
Also the carpet in the bedroom was lifting by the wall again showing that no maintenance is being carried out.
For an expensive hotel this is very disappointing.
I also ate in the restaurant. The curry had on three pieces of chicken in it. Very poor food. No value for money.",1,2014,10,19
245,Spot on! ,"If I only reviewed the shower alone, it would get ☆☆☆☆☆☆! Overnighted here for business and I must complement the staff for their efficiency and helpful attitude.  Room was fresh and spacious, breakfast was plentiful. ",5,2014,10,18
245,Convenient,"As we had an early flight from Dublin last Tuesday we booked in overnight to the airport Radisson as is is a five minute walk from T2.  I have used this hotel in the past and I trust the Radisson brand.  This time I was very disappointed.  Granted some renovation and painting was going on in lobby but sad to say our room was 'tired'.  For a Blu hotel the room was way below expectation and away overpriced.  There was no stand for our cases, no hot water in the morning. I did mention this on our leaving and was told that I should have let them know and the heat would be turned up.  On the plus side the bed was comfortable and the shuttle service was included in the price of the accommodation.  Next time around I may look for better value at Dublin Airport but will avail of Radisson hospitality elsewhere as I trust the brand.",3,2014,10,18
245,Pre Flight,"We attended this hotel prior to an early morning flight and the hotel was as close to the airport as you could possibly get, although a 24hr courtesy mini bus was provided. The check in was quite harrowing as they couldnt find our internet booking and we were informed that all the standard rooms were taken but they could provide us with a superior room but at an additional cost of about €50.00. As we were left with little choice we reluctantly agreed. The room was nice but not really anything special, facilities were good and the hotel was very clean and the staff couldn't be faulted",4,2014,10,17
245,Great Place to Stay When Flying in/out of Dublin Airport!,"I stay here whenever I have to fly out of Dublin Airport the next day. Most comfortable bed I've found in a hotel anywhere! Staff were very friendly and helpful; there is a complimentary shuttle every 15 minutes/24 hours a day to and from the airport, which is less than 5 min. away. For a great night's sleep and a quiet, comfortable room, i highly recommend you stay here.",5,2014,10,17
245,great location for airport,My boyfriend and I stayed here September 2014 for convenience to airport. Room was good and bed comfy suitable for our needs. Bar and restaurant very good customer service only small complaint was presentation of food I had chicken and ham pie which was just poured over plate ( might have just been last of scrapping ). Free WiFi and airport shuttle bus next morning was a benefit would definitely recommend best location for airport.,4,2014,10,16
245,excellent location near airport for early morning flights,"The location near the airport couldn't be more convenient. It is located right next to the airport. We decided to return our rental car that night and take the Radisson Blu shuttle (for a fee) to airport the next morning to eliminate the headache of returning the car. This is a buisness hotel so it offered very good ammenities such as airport shuttle, Free Wi-fi, business center, exercise room etc. Check in and check out was quick and efficient. The hotel bar and restaurant were good and our AAA rate of 107 euros for a king bed included breakfast which was a fair price. I booked this hotel several weeks out which was good because due to the National Hurling championship there were few rooms to be had in Dublin and the price was close to 200 euros per night. 
The room was fairly large and clean as was the bathroom. Water pressure was very good and the bed comfortable with lots of pillows. Another plus is the same day cancellation policy which is convenient if you are not sure of your schedule or if a flight is cancelled or oversold. I would stay here again if flying in or out of the DUB airport.",5,2014,10,14
245,BUSINESS ROOM IMPROVEMENT,It was good to find increased numbers of electrical outlets in the Business Rooms of this hotel. On a previous visit I was unhappy about the lack of plugs for anyone wishing to work in their room. It appears that the desk areas have been redesigned and although I can't tell if this is recent or just a different room layout it was a welcome relief to find several outlets to accommodate multiple appliances. This is the most convenient hotel to the airport with a frequent bus shuttle to the terminal. The bar food could be a little more adventurous but for a traveler with a plane to catch this hotel is clean and convenient. Some rooms need better thermostats to adjust radiators as the rooms can get cold.,4,2014,10,14
245,"Excellent location, 5 minutes to walk to the airport","+ Location very close to the airport, room light and everything necessary here, shower kit contains: shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion in 30 ml tubes, which could be reused - perfect for traveller, you can dring tea or coffee in the room, different types of power plugs.
- Price 109 EUR per night without breakfest expencive, stuff not very friendly, no snacks in the room  if you arrive late.",4,2014,10,14
245,Run Down Hotel,If you have a night stop and you have low expectations then you will be ok.  Room are shabby looking and need some work done.  If you want aircon you wont get it! It's comfort cooling and it did not work.  The solution given was to open the windows!  This would be great if you were not so close to a runway!  On a positive note Jose on Reception is professional and cares.  He saw a problem and attempted to fix it.  However as most problems need a senior person to sort... It fell on deaf ears!  Jose thanks for having common sense!,2,2014,10,13
245,Need Maintenance,"There is a lot of nice things to say about this hotel; the staff is very friendly and the food is nice. The T3 restaurant has a wide selection. Travelling on business I was in and out a few times and thus had two different rooms in one week. The first room had a toilet that would not flush, the second one had lamps not working and a safety handle in the bath tub almost breaking loose. I fixed the toilet myself and the other items I only mentioned while checking out. The point I would like to make is that it is a pity that hotel management does not see to that things work, it should not take much effort to make things that much better.

In spite of it all, I might come back. For a business stay the working distance to the airport is a very big plus in my book.",3,2014,10,10
245,Painful!,"Arrived in early evening and opened door to room to find the heater on. The temperature in the room was 30 degrees. There was a restricter on the window and no air conditioning. I called the front desk suggesting we take a different room-one that we would be able to sleep in. I was told that a maintenance person would come right up. We waited 10 minutes and no one came so I went to reception. I was told that the supervisor would need to shut off the heat and that the room would then cool off. We went to dinner expecting the room to be cooler when we returned. Unfortunately, it was not. I made a third trip to reception and again asked for a different room so that we could get some sleep before our early morning flight. Again this was refused. I was told all the rooms were like that, which I knew was not true from speaking with other guests.
Eventually, after more frustrating discussion at the front desk I was offered a different room if I paid a 40 euro upgrade fee. I refused that offer and after further frustrating discussion I was reluctantly offered a different room. That room was fine.
The bottom line is that the customer service and attention to guest concerns was abysmal, but was consistent among employees, which tells me it was a management direction in relation to the manner in which guest concerns would be dealt with.
You don't need the frustration on vacation. Book your room somewhere else.",1,2014,10,08
245,Lack of customer service,"Checked in for one nights stay with husband in wheelchair, two suitcases and two hold alls. I had booked a twin room and asked for near lift. I was offered a room on third floor which would have been a problem if there had been an emergency. Despite repeatedly asking for a twin room was given double room twice, after struggling with my husband and luggage to first floor room I left him in corridor while I went up and down to reception twice to sort our room out. The room we ended up with was clean and pleasant but the toilet seat moved about and did not feel secure, but by this time after travelling all day I could not face another trip to reception to speak to staff that had practically ignored me on check in. No smile, no information about meals or facilities, no offer of help with luggage, nothing at all really. The good points were the helpful friendly shuttle drivers and the lovely breakfast served with a warm greeting and excellent service. We have stayed at other Radisson blu hotels and have been all that they could be but will not stay at this one again.",3,2014,10,08
245,Convenient stay,"Stayed here for the two nights at the end of my two week trip to Ireland.  Hotel was clean, rooms were nice.  The location was excellent and the shuttle service to the terminal was quick and convenient.  The receptionist explained to us how to get into the city center and it proved to be very easy to do.

Ask for a room in the front of the hotel. We were on the 1st floor in the back.  We heard a lot of noise as people were outside in the back smoking and talking late in the night.  Also the garbage bins are in the back and we heard the trucks picking it up in the early morning.

Restaurant was just OK.  It would have ben nice to have more menu choices.  I would stay here again as it was convenient and the price was reasonable.",3,2014,10,07
245,Great Experience!,"My wife and I stayed here the night before we flew out of Dublin. The airport service was excellent, we were upgraded to a better room for free, and the restaurant had great food. Although the airport is very close, we didn't hear but a few planes taking off. Great service, location, and room.",5,2014,10,07
245,Radisson Dublin Airport,"Stayed two nights in a Business Class Room at Radisson Dublin Airport the rooms was clean if a little dated. Had a meal on the friday night as the weather was bad the meal was just what i needed and served promptly and with a smile. I had two good nights rest i do think that some of the furniture could do with an up-date. I did not find the Business Class room any major improvement on the Standard room, so unless there was not much between the two rates i would not pay extra, I choose the Business Class room as it included the Breakfast. The Breakfast both mornings offered a good selection and was top class.",4,2014,10,07
245,Good stay,"Good clean room, nice size.
Very welcome comfortable bed after a very long day.
Quick check in despite it being late at night.
Excellent location, efficient bus transfer, free.
Much better than usual for an airport hotel.",4,2014,10,07
245,Great way to spend our last night in Ireland!,"This hotel was a lifesaver for us. We had driven down from Northern Ireland that day, and needed to prepare for our flights back to Alaska the next day.  They must had seen the look on our faces, because they upgraded us to a business class room, which gave us space in which to repack our luggage after 3 weeks in Ireland.  We asked for room service the next morning at 5 am for breakfast, and I'm sure the server was standing outside our room! At 5 am sharp the knock on the door came, and a full lovely breakfast was served.",5,2014,10,06
245,airport hotel,"closest hotel to the airport (other would be maldron across the street). shuttle service quick pickup and drop off. had a little bit of a problem at check-in convincing the receptionist that as a gold elite member there were certain benefits i should receive. i should not of had to argue the point and asked the manager to resolve this. the bathroom only has a tub with the shower inside it-no walk-in shower which i prefer. walls are thin. could hear  conversation in adjoining room. wake up call as requested .  at check out receptionist very pleasant and helpful, including joanne. 5th floor room-no outside noise. bed and bedding very comfortable for a good night's sleep.",4,2014,10,06
245,not impressed,all that was left was buisness class waste of money. food was tasteless over priced. stayed in the clarion at airport for half the price and was outstanding and thought radission was a great hotel will not be returning,1,2014,10,06
245,Great location. Excellent rooms,"Travelling from London to USA, spent one night in Dublin. Hotel location is great, as it is within walking distance from Dublin Airport. It also has a free bus/shuttle service from Hotel to Airport in case you have big luggage. Rooms are excellent, big and very well equipped.",4,2014,10,05
245,Wonderful People,"My stay had been enforced as I had missed my connecting plane, under the circumstances I was made to feel very welcome & was able to relax immediately. I wouldn't hesitate to return to this hotel as it was convenient to many places of interest & also to local bars with live music.",5,2014,10,01
245,Great location and people,"If you need a hotel near Dublin Airport this is a good one.  Nice room, decent food and very helpful people.  Their shuttle service to the airport was Excellent and we liked the option of being able to weigh your luggage prior to leaving for the airport.  The lonely thing we didn't like is their shower, we don't like having to step up 20 inches into a tub that only has 40 percent of it's surface raised to prevent slipping and utilizes a plastic door that only covers 50 percent of the opening.",4,2014,09,30
245,A Great Place to Stay,"My wife and I recently spent two nights at this hotel.  Our room was spacious and comfortable, and the furnishings modern and practical.  The hotel is an easy walk to the airport's Terminal 2, although with luggage their 24 hr./day shuttle service is the way to go.  The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.  All-in-all a great place to stay.",5,2014,09,30
245,Would stay again,"Close proximity to airport with timely airport shuttle.  Clean average size rooms.  Staff was extremely helpful in all areas of hotel.  Dining room had little ambiance and limited menu, food was normal for airport hotel, but service was great.  No complaints.",4,2014,09,30
245,Convenient to Dublin Airport,"Overall very good, room fine and functional.   Bathroom shower, like most Ireland hotels, does not keep water from flooding the floor. Breakfast good. Staff was excellent and attentive Elevators could be improved - too slow",4,2014,09,29
245,Convenient location to Dublin Airport,Great location - couldn't be closer to the terminal.  There is a shuttle bus to and from the terminal.  Hadn't stayed here before and was given a super room upgrade.  Had supper in the bar - very nice.  Staff very professional and welcoming.,5,2014,09,29
245,Average Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for one night following arriving late into Dublin. The hotel is easy to find on the airport property from Terminal 2. We arrived using a hire car we'd taken and found it without too much trouble. Beware however that this hotel does charge for parking at €7 for overnight.

We arrived and checked into our room. We opened the door to find both the double bed and sofa bed made up (which we hadn't requested) and a welcome note addressed to someone else. We called down to the reception and explained we were happy to stay in the room, however we wanted to check that we hadn't been assigned this room by mistake. This seemed to confuse some of the night staff and we where then asked to move rooms and upgraded to a Business Class room. Now to be honest, except for the coffee machine and being trusted with an iron not bolted to the ironing board, we couldn't tell much difference in the room quality (just incase you are thinking of upgrading to this room at extra cost)

The bed was a usual two singles pushed up together which isn't the greatest sleep in the world. Quiet room however and no major noises in the night which is pretty good considering we are next to an airport.

Checked out in the morning without sampling the breakfast based purely on the cost which was around €12/15 each. My advice, head to the Topaz service station and get their €6 breakfast which was excellent!

All in all, ok hotel however one night was enough.",3,2014,09,29
245,Radisson Blu - Dublin Airport.  More than what I expected from a standard double room,"We were lucky enough to have some time to weekend in Dublin at the end of May 2014, so off we jetted via the amazing Ryan air.  The flight was perfectly smooth and once we landed we needed to find our hotel. We went straight to the Tour Ireland desk and found that we could by day trip tickets for tours as well as get a shuttle bus to the hotel that was a few meters from the airport. We found the shuttle well marked and the driver very helpful. Once at the hotel the staff got our luggage and the check in staff assisted rapidly.  We were in our room within 15 minutes.  The room was very spacious and well fitted and had a very spacious bathroom which is not what you generally find in a standard double room.  The restaurant serves the nicest fish and chips as well as very good salads.  The wine list is very good as well and they cater for children.  The staff at the restaurant was very friendly and helpful.  A very pleasant stay was had and I will go back to this hotel again.  On the day of our departure, check out was very quick and the shuttle bus was waiting.",4,2014,09,26
245,Overnight stay,This was an overnight stay for an early airport departure next morning. Hotel is comfortable and met all our needs. Best feature is the proximity to airport. There is an efficient shuttle bus but it is also only 5 minutes walk to terminal one at the airport should there be any problems with the bus,4,2014,09,24
245,"A tale of two hotels - Not average, not Very Good but Good.","Rating this hotel is hard to call as it is an airport hotel, so it is bound to be busy and has a different life to many other hotels.  Our experience was the welcome atmosphere (refreshment in lobby) and staff were excellent. We were in business but had to extend for a personal reasons, Sara deserves a specific mention for being so helpful in accommodating our changing plans.  It was All Ireland weekend so prices went through the roof - but that was not unique in Dublin at this time.  
Overall the hotel was pleasant but we were disappointed with one of the rooms on the first night; a family room at the back of the hotel which seemed to be more budget class than the price would suggest.  We were changed later and  no complaints after that.  
On the other hand the hotel handyman needs to go back to ""handyman school"" as there were a number of bodge fixes that spoil the investment in newer rooms, if not dangerous.  The budget style room also had sticky stuff all over the chair arms like kids had had a tea party and it was not cleaned up.  It also seemed to take ages in the morning for the shower to get hot in some rooms; this seems like a waste of water and against the Green credentials mentioned in the room guide.  The room guide however is largely a waste of time as it is little useful information about checkout time, breakfast times, etc.   I do wish they would put water in each room as hotel air can leave you dry, 
We also ate in the bar one evening, the staff were very busy but managed it all with grace.  Food was very much what you would expect from a bar menu and was satisfactory if a tad expensive.
So overall the experience was Good (especially staff) but could do better with consistency of rooms and attention to detail - management checking and rechecking I'd say. Then it would be great.",4,2014,09,24
245,Good value,This hotel is 10 minutes in a taxi to Croake Park and less than 5 minutes in their courtesy bus from the airport making it an ideal location for All Ireland weekend in Dublin. Most of the hotels in the city centre really inflate their prices for this weekend but thankfully whilst a premium is added for this weekend their prices are a lot more sensible and affordable for families/couples staying in Dublin that weekend for the game.,4,2014,09,22
245,Only stay here if you need airport access.,"Stayed at this hotel on my last night in Ireland recently simply because it was near the airport.  So glad I only spent one night here.  Toilet was not bolted properly to ground, no wastebasket in bathroom, handle broken on closet, sleeper sofa was a horrible extra bed and air conditioning would only do down to a certain degree leaving it a miserably warn environment to sleep in.  Would definitely look at other options before staying at this hotel brand again.",2,2014,09,18
245,horrible,"Requested a twin room four weeks in advance. Given a double bed unsatisfactory as with my brother.They gave us a put you up bed. Staff not nice, Shower cold. Never again. You cant beat BEWLEYS for stop over re flight.",1,2014,09,18
245,Good but not Great,"Stayed one night on business, it is not the easiest hotel to find parking at,had to wait for someone to move out! Reception staff were pleasant and welcoming! We had booked a twin and double room in advance,but on arrival no twin but a make up camp style bed was supplied.we had dinner in the bar and it was typical bar food only much dearer. I had the double and it was a good size,basic furniture and no air conditioning which surprised me for a Radissonblue. Bathroom was average but bath plug would not stay in outlet so could not take a bath. Did not have breakfast as it was overpriced.Summing up there are far better hotels in the surrounding area which are cheaper,more comfortable and with better food! Sorry Radissonblue it's a NO from me!",3,2014,09,17
245,Great Hotel,"Recently spent two nights here on a long weekend with the family. Shuttle picks you up just outside terminal 1 or 2 and it's a 2 minute ride to the hotel. Shuttle runs every 15 minutes or so. Lovely rooms, spacious and quiet. Breakfast was included in our price and it was awesome. Full hot buffet and a great mix of everything else you could want.
We availed of the direct coach link between the airport and downtown Dublin on a family pass. The hotel shuttle would drop us to the pickup point whenever we wanted, we'd spend the day downtown, the upon arrival, would be picked up and returned to the hotel. Tip the driver!
Overall I'd recommend this hotel again anytime.",5,2014,09,17
245,So gone downhill,"The agent at check-in took pride in telling me that I had NOT been upgraded despite my Club Carlson status. He promised a fruit plate - which never turned up.
There is no air-con at this hotel and if you open the window the aircraft noise keeps you awake.
The furniture was filthy with stains all over the chairs.
The plug sockets are designed to make it hard to plug in anything except a thin lead as they are too close to the unmoveable furniture.
All round, the high light was the shuttle which says it all.
Had a great stay a few years ago but this place is pricey and poor.",1,2014,09,17
245,Great Stay Near Airport,We enjoyed our last night in Ireland at the Radisson Blu Hotel. It was clean and the staff was great. We even got a lovely fruit plate upon arrival. Their restaurant was also good. Airport shuttle was prompt for taking us to the airport for an early flight.,5,2014,09,16
245,Unwelcoming and disorganised.,The Radisson Blu asked us to call on our arrival at Dublin Airport to be picked up at their special bus stop.  An hour later in heavy rain we were still waiting.  We kept ringing to be told the driver 'was almost there'   for over an hour. We were nearly trampled when he finally arrived with a small car by other late arrivals trying to push in front of us.  I had two small children and an elderly Mother.,2,2014,09,15
245,"Sudden, Unplanned stay","My stay was very sudden and unplanned. I was in Derry when I learned that I needed to return to Canada ASAP. My best option was to get to Dublin and fly home the next day. I arrived by bus at the Dublin Airport at about 8PM, and simply looked for what Hotels were available from the airport. The Radisson Blu answered the phone and offered me a Business room for a price that was acceptable. They picked me up with the shuttle and I was checked in by about 9:15. The price included breakfast and free wifi. The room was very good, modern, clean and comfortable. I had managed to arrange a flight with Air Canada Rouge at noon so I didn't need to rush in the morning. I went looking for something to eat but opted to do without. I wasn't very hungry so just went for a short walk outside the hotel. There isn't much around the hotel that I saw but the roads seem to have sidewalks and it looked like an energetic person could walk to the terminals from the hotel. In the morning I went for the breakfast without knowing what to expect. The breakfast was a very well optioned buffet. Lots of choice so I certainly didn't go hungry or wanting for anything. The shuttle delivered me to the terminal in the morning without incident. Given the situation, I thought the hotel staff did a very good job. They were friendly and welcoming, answered all of my questions, and I  could not have asked for more.",4,2014,09,13
245,Nicely appointed airport hotel with helpful staff,"Two nights at Dublin airport could easily have been a bit of a trial, but actually was made pleasant by the ambience and staff of the hotel.  Nice spacious room with good WiFi (free - Hilton please note!!!),   Buffet breakfast in the morning was complete chaos - not enough staff on, so this is why the score is not 5/5.  Dinner in the T3 restaurant was pub grub - lots of ""coronary on a plate"" type choices.  Too much dressing on the Caesar Salad, the mix n dip platter had about a week's worth of cholesterol on it!  Shuttle bus to / from the terminal (free). So all in all a nice visit.  I may be back!",4,2014,09,11
245,Very comfortable hotel,The rooms are very comfortable and clean and roomy.  I Was on a restricted diet and the chef and waiters were extremely accomodating!  the fillet steak was one of the best i have ever had and cooked to perfection.,5,2014,09,11
245,quick stop-over for early morning flight,"The bed was very comfortable - room well equipped. I liked the ""grab and go"" breakfast available in foyer at 4.30am(I had coffee, fruit and cereal bar ). The shuttle connection to the airport on departure was quick but unfortunately i had to stand around in the cold for 40 minutes waiting to be collected on my return. The parking fee of €7.50 per night was reasonable.",4,2014,09,11
245,"Hey, it’s An Airport Hotel.  Convenient, Efficient & Comfortable.  Good Food!","Dublin Airport is 6 miles north of the Dublin city center.  For most folks that are finishing up their vacation in Ireland the last night is always a concern.  Where to stay?   For those finishing a driving tour I would suggest staying at a hotel at Dublin Airport.  The reason being that you have to deal with returning the rental car and also getting to the departure terminal for that early morning check-in.  I chose the Radisson BLU Hotel at Dublin Airport.  One of two hotels just 2 minutes from the terminal by courtesy van.  Driving from the M50 join the M1 and head north to Dublin Airport.  Alternatively head south on the M1 (from the north).  The Radisson BLU Hotel is on the left as you enter the airport grounds.  Check-in was smooth and courteous.  I was even asked if I wanted a wake-up call.  I chose a Business Class room as the extra cost was worth it.  Good sized room, free bottled water, refrigerator, TV, work desk and free wi-fi.  Large king-size bed with a wonderful mattress and in room air-conditioning made a comfortable night’s sleep.  Comfortable all around.  I was on the fourth floor and had a view of the Irish Sea beyond the long term parking.  The T3 Restaurant is divided into a bar area and a dining area.  Good varied menu and fair prices for an airport hotel.  Food quality was very good.  Wait service responsive and courteous.   Morning check-out was smooth and courtesy van transfer to departure terminal took two minutes.I  n summary: room price is competitive to hotels farther from the airport.  Suggestion: book room only if you have an early flight check-in.- saves on cost.  Grab breakfast at the airport.",4,2014,09,08
245,Rest before Flight,"Stayed here last night, prior to early morning flight. Despite having a room facing the terminal and runway, slept very well with minimal noise pollution. Excellent shuttle bus service at 530am . Staff friendly and efficient. Cannot recommend highly enough. ",5,2014,09,08
245,Very disappointed,"One expects quality in a Radisson Blu property.  Unfortunately, we did not find it here.  The lobby and public spaces on the ground floor are very nicely appointed and fairly consistent with the Radisson Blu brand; the guest rooms are another story, or at least ours was.  The room had not been updated in quite some time--or if it had, then it had been done so very poorly--and overall was dark and unappealing.  Service can best be described as inattentive.  As noted in other reviews, although this is an airport hotel, it is not readily accessed by foot from the terminals; in fact, we found it exceptionally hard to walk there, as it involves crossing a network of roads, and wayfinding is a challenge!.  One can take the shuttle bus, but that can involve a wait, and in any case we could not locate its pick-up point.  Since convenience is a primary motive for most travelers choosing to stay in an airport venue, this was a major shortcoming.  Breakfast was very good, but the service was sluggish.  In the course of a month long holiday in Ireland and Scotland, we stayed in ten properties; this was the only one with which we were notably dis-satisfied.",2,2014,09,08
245,Overpriced but Ok,"I had high expectations for the price paid, but the experience didn't justify the price. 
I booked a business room with twin beds. The room did seem to have received the recent renovation, now equiped with a flat screen TV and modern furnishings, however it was a fairly small room. The bathroom was clean, but the main shower lacked power. The room would have been file for about 2/3's of the price I paid. 
The main upshot of the business room is that breakfast is included. Breakfast was very nice, with a good selection, although the service was rather poor, the staff were not attentive and our table piled up with dirty dishes.
Location isn't great either, although it is an aiport hotel it is not connected to the terminal and it is not particularly easy to walk to. Going into town costs around €25 by taxi. 
One bonus is that you can use the local leisure centre included in the rate which had nice facilities. 
The other major let down was the lack of recognition of Club Carlson status and adherance to benefits. I'm Gold but didn't receive an upgrade or explaination of why I was not upgraded. I didn't receive the welcome gift I was entitled to, even though I called to reception asking about it. There was a sign in the room describing the Club Carlson benefits, including the welcome gift, so it just rubbed salt in the wound.",3,2014,09,07
245,Shocking Hotel,I stayed here for a day in August to be close to the airport for an early flight. Location was the only redeeming quality of this hotel......this is why I didn't give it one star. Was able to check in about 10am which was helpful. The fourth floor where I was staying had breakfast plates with food on the lying outside many of the doors(including my room). i attributed this to the early check in. I was wrong. Despite numerous calls to the front desk asking for them to be removed they were still there at 11pm. I object to greasy food being left outside my door for over 12 hours. I don't know if the staff only work up until a certain time but that is just unacceptable. We went down for dinner later and the restaurant/bar was busy. We were told in no uncertain manner by two servers that we had to leave and we couldn't get drinks while we waited outside. Luckily there was one decent server. He came outside and took our order. The room my friends stayed in on the first floor was dirty. There was even a terrible smells on that floor. All in all I was shocked that such a big name hotel left food just lying around and had terrible bar service....and 11 euro's for two bottles of water is just highway robbery. Stay clear of this hotel,2,2014,09,07
245,Very good hotel,"The room was clean and very nice. There is a bus shuttle service to the terminals...24/24 hours!!! There is a restaurant and a bar directly inside the hotel. There is free wi-fi, very fast. I had breakfast directly in the room and was very good quality!",5,2014,09,06
245,Radisson feedback,"The hotel was pleasant, clean and of a high standard. food was great both in the restaurant and breakfast bar. The staff were very helpful throughout my staff. I would be happy to stay there again. Great location to the airport.",4,2014,09,05
245,Awsome saty .,I had a wonderful stay at the Radission Blu with family staff were great and from food to room everything was very good  could not ask for more thank you . I so recomend this hotel to everyone who is flying in or out as it's the best in area i feel  we all enjoyed are stay .,5,2014,09,05
245,Handy for the Airport,"I stayed overnight at the Radisson as I had to catch an early Flight, The checking in experience was quick and info explained well about the express checking out, the Receptionist was efficient but did not appear welcoming, no info about facilities was given, I had selected the hotel for it's proximity to the Airport Terminal and to be able to check in for my flight, I had to find the Airline console and the restaurant. The meal and service in the restaurant was very good. The room was very large, but no plugs in sink or bath, the room was also quite noisy as my sleep was disturbed by people talking in the corridor or other rooms. The Housekeeping Staff that I met when leaving were very friendly greeting me and smiling. The express check out was a simple process and they supply regular Courtesy Coaches to the Terminals. It was an OK experience but I will probably Try one of the other Hotels on the Airport Complex next Time i go to Ireland.",4,2014,09,03
245,Dublin Airport Hotel,"Great value for Dublin Airport hotel.  The hotel has convenient shuttle buses but beacuse the hotel is within the Airport area, it is also walking distance to both Terminals.  The staff at check in desk and in the restaurants are very friendly and professional.  My rate included breakfast which offers a full selection catering to all tastes.    I",5,2014,09,03
245,Efficient and easy access to airport,"This is a great hotel if you need to either a) fly to Dublin for a business meeting, or b) stay near the airport. The hotel is clean although it needs some updating/repairs. The staff at the front desk is probably one of the best aspects. We were planning on going to the airport two hours ahead to fly back to the US. The hotel person alerted us that you clear US customs in Dublin and you needed 3 hours. She said two other guests missed their flight yesterday after getting there two hours ahead. She was correct and saved us from missing our flight. My only criticism is their online reservation system. I don't know if it was just me but I was booking my room for August in April. I kept having to reset the date on their screen as it kept defaulting back to april. I thought I had corrected that but apparently I had not. When I went to check in in August, I was told I was charged as a no show for my April reservation. I had to pay a lot more to book a new room for August and I guess I am fortunate they had a room available. Usually I double and triple check everything. I was surprised the hotel never sent me anything that said I was a no show.",4,2014,09,02
245,Nice hotel but expensive,We stayed here after our flight for one nite as it was 9 before we got out of the airport we decided to stay here before heading home. We had a meal there that nite and it was lovely. The room was spacious but could have offered more for the price we paid. It was €150 for the nite with no breakfast. Staff were friendly and free shuttle bus to and from airport. Overall Very close to airport so good location and nice hotel but expected a little more as I have stayed in Radisson in other places but expensive.,4,2014,09,02
245,Poor Room,"I stayed the hotel on the 28th August for 1 night prior to a flight in the morning, and the stay was booked via Club Carlson Points. I was upgraded to a Business Class Room. 

Check in was easy, although astonishingly for a Hotel in Ireland, I was informed that they cant take UK Debit Cards for Incidentals (I have been staying in hotels in Ireland for the last 10 years and this is the first hotel ever to not take UK debit cards.. Not every wants / has a Credit Card).

The room, was large, with a nespresso machine, and a double bed, the bed was comfy as always at Radisson Hotels. However, there was no cups in the room to make a drink, and after ringing housekeeping none turned up, so the Nespresso Machine was useless.
The bath had a gaping hole around the taps (about 4"" long by 2"" wide). 

There is no double glazing, so you can hear all the airport noise.

Checkout was easy,where I commented on the items above. The shuttle bus was very good and took minutes to get to Terminal 1",2,2014,09,01
245,Great hotel for overnight stay,"As we had an early flight leaving from Dublin Airport,  I booked us into the Radisson Blu hotel, Dublin Airport. The room was spacious and clean - all that you would rquire for an overnight stay.
The staff were friendly and helpful. We had a meal in the restaurant and found our meals to be quite delicious. The hotel also offered a complimentary bus shuttle to the airport.",4,2014,09,01
245,Great airport hotel!,The hotel was clean and welcoming.  Room was comfortable and staff was efficient. I was in Dublin for a business meeting and the hotel was very accommodating to my many last minute requests. The staff was accommodating and efficient. Good choice for business travelers. ,4,2014,09,01
245,Worst night's sleep in 40 years,"There was an American Football game (Penn St vs FCU) being playing in Dublin that weekend so rooms were scarce or non-existent at the Airport. Only availability was a ""Business suite"" which was overpriced and reeked of mildew! . The bed was sagging from continual one person occupancy (This was a business suite which frequently means one person occupies the room).  If you're not on that side of the bed, you roll into the person on the ""worn"" side of the bed all night long.  They should try flipping or rotating their mattresses if they don't want to replace worn mattresses. Nothing like a lousy night's sleep before leaving on a 7hr plane ride.",1,2014,08,31
245,Business Trip Hotel Meets Business Needs,"Staff is excellent; breakfast is OK, have had better in Europe; slept with the window open as the room was slightly warm; love the free shuttle to and from the airport that is quick and complimentary.  If you are a fitness guru or workout daily you will not want to stay here - the lack of a gym keeps stays here short.",4,2014,08,31
245,Helpful Staff Very Convenient for Airport,Stayed just one night on way back home after a conference.  The room was clean and comfortably appointed but felt a bit airless and stuffy.   The staff however I found particularly helpful and welcoming esp. for a chain hotel.  The reason for choosing this place was how close it was to the airport and I found the grab and go breakfast and the shuttle bus made my early morning flight less of a hassle.  However I would warn anyone flying out that Dublin Airport somehow hasn't got the check in thing down at all.  Although I just had to do a bag drop the queue was the biggest I have ever been in an airport and it was a rather fraught experience and tight that I didn't miss my flight. (I was just thanking my lucky stars I wasn't doing it all with kids in tow.)  Get there properly early is my advice.,4,2014,08,31
245,Very comfortable sleep at Radisson Dublin Airport,"Stayed in business class room, which was very spacious and good lighting. Bed was extremely comfortable and the linen of a high standard. Excellent choices available from breakfast buffet. Will stay again whne in Dublin",5,2014,08,31
245,DIRTY,"3. times that the room is dirty, the table was picking and left over crumbs from the previous customer. Dust everywhere, no fresh air. Before we complained about it, they changed the room but this was not clean ether. We paid 155 euro and it was a very ugly feeling to sleep in the dirty room",1,2014,08,30
245,Excellent,"Have stayed in this hotel a few times .. Excellent hotel, close to the airport, shuttle bus to and from airport,  rooms very well 
furnished with comfortable beds, tv and wifi, bathrooms, staff excellent ..",4,2014,08,29
245,Nice hotel pity about the food,"Great location,  nice room and quiet for an early morning flight, did the park and fly, very convenient and good value.
Relaxed bar with good staff however the food is not up to scratch, dine elsewhere and you will love it.",4,2014,08,29
245,Non-existent Internet,"This hotel is well situated for a single night's stay.  Airport transfer is every 15 minutes.  Food is at a price and quality expected for an airport hotel.  Rooms are nice with great beds and all-important sheet-duvets rather than bed spreads.  The Internet never loaded in our room, which made it impossible to check in for our flight.",3,2014,08,29
245,Great hotel and location for Airport,Excellent hotel. Perfect location for Airport. Very friendly and helpful staff. Very good rooms. Spotless hotel. Very impressed with staff member picking up cigarette buts discarded in shrubbery in hotel grounds !!,5,2014,08,28
245,Very good airport hotel,"Staff are very friendly and helpful and create a great atmosphere for an airport hotel . Rooms are large ,comfortable and clean .
Breakfast is typical Radisson fare but served well . 
The only gripe I would have is that I think they started cooking the veg for my lunch on Sunday for me to eat on Tuesday !!!! Soggy, over cooked and colourless and confusingly served with tender freshly cooked roast Beef . Disappointing .",4,2014,08,26
245,Great for a pre-flight stay,"My wife and I stayed here 1 night in a very clean room with an extremely comfortable bed before an early morning flight. The room was well equipped with a trouser press, coffee machine, in-room safe and a small fridge. The LED reading lamp beside the bed is very effective for reading without disturbing a partner. The restaurant was very good as always; we enjoyed an excellent burger and chunky chips. There is a shuttle to the airport every 15 minutes.
This hotel is a great choice for a short stay near Dublin airport.",4,2014,08,25
245,My stay at the Radisson Blu,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the hotel.  I was going on holiday from Dublin so travelled from Cork and the hotel was in the perfect location for the airport with free transfers to the airport.  Rooms and food excellent, so great experience",5,2014,08,25
245,Quick check in and out,The reception desk was very prompt in processing my check in and check out and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful. I wanted an adapter for my tablet and the staff went to a lot of trouble to make sure I got it quickly and told me how to use it properly. I had a room change taken care of by reception after I smelled cigarette smoke in my area. the room I got was very nice and was nice and quiet. It was also close to the elevator which I need because of difficulty walking.,4,2014,08,23
245,Ideal for pre/post flight rest!,"Great value when you're using the hotel car park for a short stay. Stayed one night before an early check-in at Dublin airport and left car in hotel car park for 4 nights - very good value. Very handy! Printed our boarding passes off the night before at reception. Good night's sleep; clean well-equipped room; fab breakfast; and, lovely staff in both the dining room and reception areas. Defo will be back next time I have an early check-in and need to leave the car a few nights!",5,2014,08,22
245,Close to airport.  Nice staff 24 hour shuttle,I was in Ireland on business and I had a 8 AM flight. I want to stay someplace close to the airport in this hotel could not have been more convenient. I was able to pay at night to save time in the morning. The staff was very nice and efficient and although I had a problem that had nothing to do with the hotel the young woman at the desk helped me solve it.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable with furnishings from the midcentury 50s so it's very stylish,4,2014,08,22
245,Shabby stay. ,The hotel itself could certainly do with a sprucing up! Dull & drab! In addition to that the food in the restaurant was horrible. We ordered two mains but had to return as the food was cold. I then changed my order to caesar salad & was hugely surprised that it  contained anchovies! Not a traditional caesar for sure. When we were checking out their computer system wasn't working so they couldn't charge us! We had to leaves our visa details and we were charged later. The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to the airport & the free shuttle. It certainly is not a 4 star hotel & I won't bd returning as there are nicer hotels for less money in Dublin airport! ,2,2014,08,20
245,Disappointing Stay,"Stayed there for one night, rooms were clean but needed updating a bit, wall lights were all broken and lopsided, there was a huge streak of what looked like blood on the walls! At Midnight we were rudely awoken with what at first we thought was a fight going on outside in the grounds but then realised it was coming from the adjoining door in the room to the room next door and was the TV, this went on until after 1am! We went to the bar/restaurant for dinner and were shown to a table and given a menu and half an hour later after asking the batman someone finally came to take our order, we both ordered fish and chips which when it arrived was terrible, overdone and dry, not cheap either! Very disappointed with the hotel as I really expected something better from the name and the price!",2,2014,08,20
245,Great place to stay before and early morning flight.,"Raddison Blu hotels are pretty much without exception excellent at their price point. It is hard to add much of significance to what has been said before, but all the usual comments apply - very comfortable, very clean, good food. One thing that stood out for me was that I detected an error on my bill; now you might think that I raise this as a complaint - but I mention it to commend them for the speedy and efficient way in which they corrected the error and without question. I subsequently had to email them about another matter and the reply was very speedy and very helpful indeed. So, top marks for staff helpfulness. The view out of the room window across the airport was very interesting as well, if you like planes.",5,2014,08,20
245,Nice airport hotel,"I've stayed at this hotel 3 times, most recently in may 2014. The location of the hotel is in walking distance of the airport, and all my stays I've walked to the hotel from the terminal and used the free shuttle back to the terminal. The service is good and the rooms are quite nice, at least for a short stop. The food was also OK. Overall a decent hotel for short stays and I would surely be back.",4,2014,08,20
245,Overnight.,"The hotel location is excellent for those flying, especially on an early morning flight.  Its a bit pricy, in my opinion, when compared with other airport hotels, which may, however, not be as conveniently located. 
The bedroom was slightly tired, and the carpet rather dreary.  The bed, however, was very comfortable. 
In the bathroom, the bath was chipped, and the shower operation could be better. 
Breakfast is overpriced at €19.00, but tea/coffee and a pastry is available for €5.50. 
We did not have dinner. 
The staff were good overall. They seemed to be mostly non-Irish.",4,2014,08,18
245,"Friendly staff, great breakfast and clean",We stayed at this hotel twice during a two week adventure. Both times we were greeted by very friendly front desk staff. We got the option that came with continental breakfast. Our flight was really early both times and we were going to miss breakfast. The wonderful lady at the front desk said it could be delivered to our room anytime. Both days they delivered breakfast trays at 4:30am. It was MUCH better than a typical continental breakfast. There was more food than either of us could eat and it was fresh! The rooms were clean and comfy. We had drinks in the bar and it also had a nice atmosphere. This is now our stop in and out of Ireland each year! We were also there around Christmas/New Years and they have a huge Christmas tree in the lobby. It was a nice touch.,5,2014,08,18
245,Disappointing stay,I booked this hotel via booking.com and as I was travelling with a friend asked for single beds. When we arrived at the hotel we were informed that booking via booking.com meant I had only requested single beds the only thing the hotel guarantee is that you have a room. I think this should be made more evident at time of booking. One of the reasons I choose this hotel was to be able to use the leisure club unfortunately this closes at 6pm on saturdays,2,2014,08,18
245,Family City Break,"The Junior Suite/Family Room is a very comfortable and excellent choice for a family with 2 or more kids. The room is enormous, 1 double bed, a sofa couch that converts to another double bed, and by request you can have a choice of a cot for an infant, or another single kids bed depending on age, all for no extra cost which we found brilliant. Not sure if we were lucky or if this is always the case, but great service!   We have 3, aged 3, 6 and 8, and with a room view overlooking Dublin Airport, this hotel offers a spectacular view with a difference.   We have stayed here several times and the service has always been excellent. Helpful staff, great food and a spacious relaxed feel throughout the hotel, its a great location to spend time and explore Dublin or even the surrounding areas.",5,2014,08,18
245,Perfect location if you have an early morning flight,"The Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport isn't exactly the lap of luxury, but it was a great spot for a short overnight stay. With an early flight home, we didn't feel like making the 40 minute drive from our relatives, so we booked a couple of rooms for one night. The hotel is right on the airport grounds. We booked into our rooms early (full marks to the hotel staff for making that happen) so we could go off for the day and golf, we dropped off our Hertz car rental late at night and were able to walk to the hotel from the terminal. In the morning, it took all of 4 minutes to get to Terminal 2 via the free hotel shuttle, which I was really pleased about.

As for the rooms, after having read reviews from others, we spent the extra money for Business Class. The rooms were a decent size, relatively clean (the bathrooms could use some tlc), the beds were comfortable and so was the little sitting area for watching tv. We were happy the windows could open as the rooms were a bit stuffy when we first walked in.

Overall, the staff were very helpful and the location is really convenient, but I think this hotel is suited for short stays vs long.",3,2014,08,16
245,Look elsewhere first,"Overpriced, rooms in less than ideal condition, and a restaurant that serves you water in reused and refilled water bottles....and then charges you for it.  Ridiculous.   Location of hotel to airport for early morning flights was excellent.",1,2014,08,14
245,Convenient and Good service,A good place to chose if flying out of Dublin. Good for families. Nice restaurant options. Looked like a good breakfast and a speedy option when flying in the morning. Staff were friendly and helpful.,4,2014,08,12
245,Perfect airport hotel,"Radisson Blu in Dublin is so close to the airport that you can actually walk to the hotel from the arrivals terminal. In terms of service and facilities, it is like any other Radisson. The hotel has a nice lounge with a bar, and this place is perfect for small meetings.",4,2014,08,10
245,superb location for airport travelers,"Hotel is very pleasant and has about the best location for Dublin Airport.  The location is an easy walk from the Airport, we did it with two max weight bags and two wheeled carry-ons & we are old people.  The Hotel itself is a bit dated, with air conditioning only in the Business Class rooms. The breakfast (included with Business Class room) is excellent, good fresh food, a wide variety of offerings & excellent service.  We found the reception desk staff a bit less ""hospitable"" than what we have come to expect in Dublin, but it might pass for good in New York.  Food was OK and the prices were reasonable. But the convenience to the Airport is the reason to stay here, it is less than 5 mins. easy walk on excellent and traffic controlled streets. The Airport bus gets you to city centre in 20 mins, even in traffic, so a great place to stay for a few nights whilst passing through Dublin en route somewhere.",3,2014,08,09
245,Excellent choice for airport accomodation,"Frequent shuttle service from airport
Very spacy rooms
Real Irish pub in the hotel where you can taste %100 irish beef along with Guinness.
Very nice decorated rooms
Highly recommended to anyone looking for an accomodation by airport",5,2014,08,08
245,Atkinson's Stay,Room was clean.  Would have liked more options for kids TV in the morning and evening.  Free breakfast is a must.  Toilet did not work and leaked.  Shower door was only 1/2 a door and water went everywhere while bathing.  Water temperature fluctuated while bathing.  Free parking is a must when you have paid to stay in the hotel.,3,2014,08,08
245,"Great location, staff and value - don't eat there","Family room comfy - online booking was only 70euro, but food was awful.  Dry, tasteless fish, kids food was again boring, dry and tasteless.  The meal and wine cost 20 euros more than the room and the kids would barely touch theirs.  No options for any veg or fruit for the kids either.  A shame, because otherwise a great place.",3,2014,08,07
245,Good hotel,I stayed at this hotel for one night because it is near the airport and I am a Radisson member.  I was treated well because of that and given an excellent room.  The service was good but I was not there for very long.  I cant add any more than that,4,2014,08,07
245,"Radisson Blu, Dublin Airport",Had a businees meeting at the airport. Very satisfied with accommodation and location - short walk to Terminal or use of hotel shuttle bus if weather inclement. The food was excellent both for my evening meal (daily specials) and breakfast.,5,2014,08,07
245,It is a utility hotel,"The only flaw in this hotel is the fact that there is no A/C in your basic rooms...I read this in the various reviews and still booked the room due to its close proximity to the airport.  The hotel itself is in an awesome location, the exterior and interior were well kept and clean. The staff were really helpful, attentive, and their appearance clean and neat. The restraunt was awesome, the staff were prompt and engaging with the customer. The food was also very good. The shuttle driver was nice and helpful even at 230a.   I had an awesome stay...I slept well (despite no A/C) and everything was comfortable.",3,2014,08,04
245,Convenient but very average,"Poor/slow response to a few basic requests such as ice, towels, plus sheets and blankets for sofa sleeper (couldn't use it as it was). Nice coffee maker in room but no cups. No bottle opener for beer in mini bar. Eventually a very nice security man and his 'helper' did their best to find the items we requested. Seemed to have little or no staff.
Efficient check in and good shuttle bus... But, I'll try somewhere else the next time!",3,2014,08,03
245,Convenience of Airport not worth the price point,"Overall, this hotel was not maintained to the high standards of a Radisson, especially at the price point of this location.  If you're staying for the close proximity to the Dublin airport and shuttle, consider staying at a hotel further away and pay for a taxi to the airport.",3,2014,08,02
245,Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport,"Excellent place to stay when flying into or out of Dublin Airport. Hotel is clean and beautiful, room was quite large. Restaurants and breakfast are delicious and have great hours, especially for travelers. Shuttle picks you up out front to take you to your terminal. I would stay here again if using Dublin airport.",5,2014,08,02
245,Convenient but gross,"Obviously, we stayed here because of the hotel's proximity to the airport.  But, the rooms were very small and filthy.  The solid black sofa in our room appeared to have a stain from bodily fluids.  Gross!  That made us no0t want to touch anything.  Plus, there's no A/C, so you need to leave your windows open-- inviting bugs and tons of noise into your room.  It is, after all, adjacent to the airport.",2,2014,08,01
245,Expensive!,"This hotel was reasonable in most ways but the price was much higher than was warranted.  Early morning ""breakfast"" was a poor affair with a boiled jug of coffee and muesli bars. Facilities such as I needed were fair but the bathroom was disappointing. the shower had a swinging glass panel along the bath which is antiquated and not very convenient in my opinion. Staff were fine and shuttle service to airport was good.",3,2014,08,01
245,Close to the airport but nothing special,I chose this hotel because it was adjacent to the airport and I had an early flight the next day. The room was very unimpressive and not at all what I would expect from a Radisson. Very little decorative features; it felt like a room someone just threw furniture in. Staff was nice and the on-site restaurant was convenient.,3,2014,07,31
245,Convenient but slightly shabby,"With an early flight to the States and notorious lengthy check-in and customs queues, spending your last night near the Dublin airport is advisable. This hotel, a 2 minute drive from the terminal with 24-hr free shuttle service, fits the bill nicely. That being said, the rooms aren't totally updated, the staff slightly blasé, and the plumbing a little finicky.",3,2014,07,30
245,Achieves what it sets out to offer,"Conveniently located for airport, local business parks and motorway network. Pleasant service although can be too few check in/out staff at peak times. Don't think you will have a quiet relaxing meal in the T3 restaurant - the TVs are turned up to high volume. They seem to assume that everybody likes to listen to sport! This is a real pain! Quietist rooms on the opposite side to the airport. Not all rooms have air conditioning which can make the rooms pretty warm in the summer and it is difficult to turn the heating down in the winter! It's fine as a business or transit hotel but I don't think you would want to stay here on vacation.",4,2014,07,30
245,Rather disappointing.,"My wife and I stayed in this Dublin airport hotel on two separate occasions recently. We stayed over on the night of Thursday 3rd July prior to flying. To Vancouver,British. Columbia for a two week visit to see family. We also stayed on the evening of Saturday 19th July on our return before travelling to home to Northern Ireland.
On both occasions check in was efficient and friendly.
Our major problem on both occasions was the VERY SLOW service for dinner in the restaurant. We had to wait for a considerable amount of time before a drinks order was taken and even longer for a food order. On both stays we waited for over half an hour before our food arrived and it was only fish and chips! We noticed that other customers had even longer waits. We felt embarrassed for the poor service to visiting tourists. It was dreadful especially compared to the swift,professional service we experienced in Canada.
We hadn't prearranged for credit card payment at checkout as we thought we would pay as you go.
We found it difficult to get our bill and on the second occasion we decided to charge the food to our room and pay in the morning. We were tired,jet lagged and needed to sleep.
We had just drifted off to sleep when our telephone rang and the restaurant told us that reception couldn't charge the meal as we had not prearranged the facility. I had to get up go down and sort it out at reception.
We had tried to pay using our American Express card in the restaurant during our first stay but they did not accept Amex. We were surprised as it was acceptable for payment at reception.
It is our view that there needs to be a review of how the restaurant is managed very soon.
During our second stay we were delighted to be upgraded to a business class room and then we discovered that the bed size was smaller and as there was only one dressing gown,the room must be for one traveller only.
After a night's sleep we arose in the morning to catch our transport home only to discover that we had no hot water to have a shower. When I phoned reception I was told that the hotel had had a problem with hot water but it had been solved. We were advised just to run the taps and it would come through. An hour later and two more phone calls to reception we still had no water. We checked out without a wash or breakfast to catch our transport almost two hours late.
We made the point at reception on checkout but didn't even receive an explanation or apology.
We travel out of Dublin Airport on a regular basis but we will have reservations about using this hotel in the future.",3,2014,07,30
245,Overnight stay in Family room on 17 July 2014,"Was proving to be quite good until it came to going to bed and we discovered the condition of the sofa-cum-bed, which was very uncomfortable and did not appear to be fit for purpose. This, unfortunately, resulted in a poor start to our holiday pror to flying out the next morning.",3,2014,07,30
245,Good for Short Business Trip,"Stayed in Room 207, Business Class in Late July 2014 for 2 nights.

Arrived late on first night. The free shuttle bus that runs every 15 minutes from the airport was very handy. Greeted by receptionist who was friendly and helpful.

I booked a business class room as it appeared to have AC according to the room details. Unfortunately it barely gave out any air at all and the room was very stuffy. Opened the window and the combination of plane noise (obviously expected at an airport hotel!) and smoke drifting up from the staff smoking point directly below the window made me close it again pretty quickly.

One other room negative is the poor television reception. With fairly slow internet speed NetFlix was off the cards, so the next best thing is the TV but this was, at times, unwatchable. Irritatingly Channel 5 and Big Brother worked perfectly - of all the things!

Ate at the restaurant for breakfast which was nice and varied. We were in the Galway conference room for both days, the endless supply of tea and coffee was needed for this course and the lunchtime sandwiches were excellent.

I would stay here again for the convenience but it would be more comfortable in cooler months, could do with an increase in internet speed and the TV reception being sorted. ",3,2014,07,30
245,Best hotel for early flights,"Dublin was our launch point for our 2014 European adventure. I booked this hotel for it's proximity to the airport because of an early morning flight. Plain and simple I wanted to be as close to the airport as possible, so my expectations were not all the high for our 2 day stay. I have to say that the staff was wonderful, our room was clean and comfortable. The iced water with fruit was enjoyable on a warm day. I had made reservations at the Hilton for our trip back to the states, but after visiting friends at the Hilton, I was not that impressed. Not sure why they call themselves Hilton airport, no where near the airport. So, I checked with the staff at the Radisson Blu to see if any rooms had opened up on our return date. The staff told us yes and asked if we like our room. Two weeks later we returned and were placed in the same room.",5,2014,07,29
245,Very Nice,"Bar was fine, business class room was very good.  Ten minute walk to the airport and only a ten minute taxi ride into Swords.

Reasonable price.  Would recommend for a few nights.  Drinks were not that expensive",4,2014,07,28
245,Great for early morning flights,"We stayed earlier this month as we were flying early morning for our vacation. We checked in very late around  1 AM. Brilliant hotel and excellent staff. Checked in late was not a problem as we got food in the hotel which was superb. Excellent service what someone can expect from Radisson brand. The man at the front desk was very welcoming. Not sure if I got his name right ntini.
Will be back.",5,2014,07,28
245,Could not fault ,"Enjoyable stay, very close to the airport for convenience and free shuttle bus. 
First impressions were great, landed on Fridays morning, a very hot day. Arrived at the hotel and was greeted with ice cold water and fresh fruit, just what we needed! 
Staff on front desk were very helpful, nothing was to much trouble and supplied us with useful information about buses and the city centre. Our room was ready at half 9 in the morning, we did expect to have to wait but not here. 
Room was basic but fine for our stay, lovely view over to the coast line. The bed was great, we both slept really well, and enjoyed the aircon!! 
Food in the restaurant was good, we had an evening meal and I chose the fillet steak which I enjoyed, only problem we found was the portions were massive, good value for money though. 
Overall a good, clean helpful hotel with friendly staff and good food! ",4,2014,07,27
245,Best Airport Hotel in Dublin,If traveling in or out of Dublin airport you must experience the convenience and service of the Radisson Blu ....no worries about not getting to the airport on time and guaranteed to get a good meal and good night's sleep!,5,2014,07,26
245,great place to stay especially for airport travel.,"great all around. Staff were helpful. experience of air travel (which is challenging at the best of times) was made easier. Food, rooms and access to airport shuttle made life a whole lot easier. Many thanks.",5,2014,07,25
245,Average...but decent,"Three stars at best... The hotels is literally walking distance from the airport and apparently they have no issue if you take take the airport cart with you to the hotel. Cab drivers refuse to drive here since the hotel is so close to the airport (5 minute walk). The hotel does provide a shuttle service though.  The lobby of the hotel does not have air conditioning. As a matter of fact, you need to book the the higher priced ""Business Class"" rooms in order to get A/C and that barely cools off the room. Paid way too much and received so little at this hotel. Would only suggest staying here if you have an early morning flight and want to be close to the airport.",3,2014,07,25
245,Returning to My Irish Roots,"Staying at the Raddison Blu was a great choice. Clean, quite, great food and very accommodating staff who made our stay above average.  If you visiting Ireland the Raddsion Blu is a perfect spot to stay for your arrival.  I would recommend the hotel. It is really outstanding.",4,2014,07,25
245,Good place to stay before departing,"nice room, clean, comfy, new or newly renovated. Very close to both terminals.   I found the breakfast to be too expensive (above 12 Euros for a continental breakfast). Nice service though @ restaurant.",4,2014,07,24
245,A belated thank you,"After reading a recent review from a traveller who did not enjoy their stay I have to say that our night spent at this hotel before an early flight to Venice last July was superb.  The staff were great, our room wonderfully spacious and spotlessly clean , high up with fantastic views, and our evening meal delicious. We found it really conveniently placed after dropping our rental car at the airport depot and taking a bus into the city to spend the afternoon.  Our travel agent in Brisbane had booked this for us and on our return we told her we felt she could happily recommend it to other clients.",5,2014,07,24
245,A Truly Mediocre Experience,"This was an attempt to have a relaxing holiday by staying at a nearby hotel for a very early flight. There was a special offer for dinner if you booked B and B by Internet.  However no staff had been told. An incredible time-consuming and ultimately stressful evening commenced and it went on unti after we were had retired for the night. We refused to pay for the meal (which was truly grim in a kind of 1970s provincial pub way). Everything smelled of chips (not real ones of course). Eventually the hotel agreed we were right and we were given a glass of wine each. The staff were OK, but the management made a dog's dinner out of something very simple. Organisational skils very much lacking there. The bus to the teminal was efficient and friendly. But I would never go there again,",1,2014,07,23
245,They have standard,"It surprised me. Location is brilliant . Next to airport and 10 min drive to city center. Clean room with nice toiletries. Peaceful. I got an amazing 4th floor room with view of ocean . 
They have standard and they are providing much better standard as compared to other hotels charging the same .",5,2014,07,22
245,Very Handy for a Day in Dublin,"Stayed for 1 night while in Dublin for rugby.

Hotel is ideally located and close to the terminal building. Yoiu can get the hotel to pick you up in the free shuttle bus, or walk in 10-15 minutes.

Check in was pain free and despite being early morning our room was ready and we were able to drop our bag and freshen up.

A quick walk back to the terminal building lets you get the airport express bus into the City.

Had booked a deal including breakfast, which was ideal to set us up for the journey home the following morning.

Room was clean and fresh and ideal for an overnight stay.",4,2014,07,22
245,"Room with a view, top hotel for planespotting.","Great for planespotting. Also great for a quiet evening/night before travelling home. Junior suite has a fantastic view and is very spacious. On the downside was some of the staff who were rather grumpy and slow. Room for improvements here! On the other hand, some of them were really nice and welcoming.",4,2014,07,22
245,They really are trying!,"We are staying one night at Dublin Radisson Blu before our return to the States. We arrived by their shuttle, and the shuttle driver carted our luggage all the way from his shuttle to our room! Reception was helpful and friendly.   The room is comfortable and fine for a  one night stay before flying out.   

However. We went to the restaurant, T3 and waited more than an hour before being served. Well, actually ... My husbands' Caesar salad came about forty minutes in to the wait, so we didn't both wait an hour. I ordered the ""Baked Fresh Vegetable Pasta with Parmesan Crust"" special, and it was...in a word...awful. 

So be advised - don't order the special. Get a burger,  my husband's burger was fine. 

The hotel rooms are restful and a fine place to prepare for a flight. The restaurant needs some work. (They did not charge us for my dinner). ",3,2014,07,21
245,Convenience is hard to beat,"We originally booked a standard room for four but discovered that the room had no air conditioning.  Changing our room was easy and seamless. Upgrade to business class was only 40 euro but the quality of the room was far, far superior....Pay the extra.  There is no breakfast included unless you get down to the lobby before 6:30 and you can grab an apple and granola bar.  The espresso machine in our room was amazing. The lounge is cold and soulless.  

My only complaint really is that for some reason we were charged for a non-arrival. I am in the middle of trying to resolve this but it is taking some time.  I would expect that a large chain that prides itself on customer service would respond faster to resolving a mistake it made.",4,2014,07,20
245,Average airport Hotel,Convenient to the airport with a decent bar and restaurant.  Shuttle service was regular.  There were some areas that showed the hotel was not maintained as well as it should be.  Outlets not working and mini bar was not cold.,3,2014,07,18
245,Perfect for the airport and good for business,"This was an overnight business stay. I walked to the hotel from Terminal 1 and it only takes a few minutes but there is an airport shuttle too. The staff are amongst the friendliest I have come across and I was warmly welcomed. The room was a business class room on the 2nd floor and had everything that I would expect. A good work desk, sofa and table, large sideboard which contains a safe and mini bar, plenty of hanging space, a trouser press, nice bathroom with fixed shower and hand held shower. There are a dozen or so TV channels all in English and Wi-Fi is free and was reliable. There was little or no noise from the aircraft but if you wanted to hear them then you could open the window if you wanted to. The air conditioning unit was remarkably quiet and efficient though you couldn't go below 18°C in chill mode.
I was let down by the length of time it took for room service to arrive - 55 minutes is not acceptable especially when you are charged for the delivery to the room. Also, there were no condiments on the plate which was an oversight. 
The room service menu should be enough to cater for most tastes. Breakfast was full Irish in the room and there are plenty of options. This hotel seems to have mastered the art of delivering meals to your room that are actually hot. Few others that I have stayed at seem to be able to do that. Both dinner and breakfast were lovely and hot, particularly breakfast. 
The hotel was very clean but the room was looking a little tired. Furniture was scratched and bumped and the sofa had what looked like emulsion paint strokes on it. It wouldn't take much to remove those marks. The bed was 2 large singles pushed together and nice and hard - how I like them. The pillows were also good. The towels were of a good size and not at all flimsy and nice and absorbent. The shower gel and shampoo had a nice fragrance to them. 
I have stayed in a few Radisson Blu hotels now and you know that they are good for business stays. I would be happy to stay again when I return for business in the Dublin area. The staff here are outstanding in my opinion.",4,2014,07,18
245,Bygone standard!,"A clean, seemingly modern hotel. Very close to airport...approx 5 minutes walk if you don't want to use courtesy bus.
 Comfortable bed apart from bevel at edge easing rolling off!
Appears to be without air-conditioning....which, in addition to a lovely thick duvet made for a (very) warm night!  :-(
Double-glazing appears to be suitable for heat insulation rather than noise insulation. The noise from 4am flights useful if you need an early morning call (we didn't)...
Finally, plug for shaver was set for power saving (it didn't work)
Suggest giving this place a miss unless you get reassurance that these problems have been solved.",2,2014,07,18
245,5/5 for location - walk to the terminal,"Friendly staff at check in - even though it was 1am and there had been an anomoly with our booking. An efficient, professional and friendly check in advisor did not just pass the keys over but took us up in the lift and made sure all was ok with our room - what hospitality.

Bed was very very comfortable, appeared to have a super soft protector underneath the mattress. There was a Nespresso in the room (it was a business class, not sure if they are in all rooms).

Breakfast was excellent, well presented, fresh and a great choice. I'm very fussy when it comes to breakfasts and I was impressed with this.

I would love to stay here again if flying into/out of airport but it will come down to the best deal. That being said, I'd be willing to be a little extra for the comfort and convenience of staying here.",5,2014,07,17
245,Perfect Location,"Great hotel in a perfect location, right in the middle of the airport, rooms clean, bed very comfortable, staff all very pleasant and anxious to help. breakfast is nice and can keep you going until the evening. I loved the coffee and cereal biscuits in the lobby for those coming and going before the restaurant opens for breakfast...a life asver",5,2014,07,16
245,A great place to stay in Dublin Airport,"If you're looking for a place to stay in Dublin Airport - Radisson Blu is a great solution - friendly staff members, restaurant/bar, minibus to the airport (24h service) that takes you to any of the terminals in a few minutes, good isolation - we couldn't hear the planes or the traffic, we slept like babies. Possibility to have a nice coup of tea in the evening and some coffee in the morning in your room - complimentary.  A great-looking menu for room service - unfortunatelly we stayed in central Dublin till late, so we didn't have a chance to taste any of it (room service finishes at 22PM). Take-away breakfast available in the morning for early flying customers, breakfast in the restaurant starting at 6:30AM. Free internet, very easy to connect to! We were very happy with our choice!",5,2014,07,16
245,Radisson Blu,"The hotel is perfectly located for an early morning flight. The restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was great. In spite of the proximity to the airport, I was not at all bothered by any high noise levels. I enjoyed my short stay immensely.",5,2014,07,16
245,Very comfortable hotel close to the airport,"+ Location just 5 minutes walk from airport, comfortable rooms, business press, shower kit, breakfast, free snacks on reception, very helpful stuff.
- Not very safe door lock - I accidentally opened wrong door - and it was actually opened.",4,2014,07,15
245,Oasis in the Airport Desert,"After spending a week in cramped quarters at the main UCD campus and faced with the necessity of needing to be at terminal 2 by 6:00 AM, the Blu offered me a relaxation, spaciousness and a good night's sleep so that I could undergo the trials of airport security well-rested and in relatively good humor.",5,2014,07,15
245,Very close to airport.,"Stayed one night here as we were flying out of Dublin, hotel is very close to the airport easy to find and we parked our car at the hotel for the week.  Clean and room was very comfortable staff our friendly and helpful.  Only had a quick take away breakfast in the early morning so can not rate food the quick grab breakfast was fine for me.",5,2014,07,13
245,Overbooked!!,I will keep this brief. Made reservation 6 months in advance. Arrived at midnight to be told they had overbooked and were sending us to a hotel 15 minutes farther from the airport. I’m still wondering why and I now see this isn’t the first time they have done this. I was called the next day to see how I was doing. I didn’t return phone call because I had made my feelings known the night before at the reception desk. This type of service is certainly not professional and decidedly substandard. I can’t recommend this hotel.,1,2014,07,12
245,Stuffy Room,"+ Location to airport.  The man on reception this morning very helpful.
- Room very hot and stuffy.  Fridge not working.  No bottled water in room and a large bottle for two people cost €5.50 in bar.  Staff in bar were lovely - but food only average.",1,2014,07,12
245,Great stay (but restaurant service was poor),"The hotel staff were professional and friendly, on arrival we were upgraded to a suite from our double room. We were very grateful to the staff for this kind gesture.

The suite was spacious and maintained to a very high standard.

The location is great as you can walk to the terminal or grab the shuttle bus every 15 minutes.

I have great trust in the radisson blu brand and have always found their standards to be very high.
Although we ate in T3 restaurant on the night and the service was very poor, so much so that I wrote up a separate review under the T3 restaurant.",4,2014,07,10
245,"Hotel and service are good, food is poor and expensive","Stay here regularly on business but usually eat out with colleagues, I now know why.

The Asian glassed salmon was bland, except for the full raw chilli. For some reason is came with three cold tomatoes and a bunch of cress leaves. I asked for soy sauce and was brought what appeared to be cream. Not ideal.

Ended up reordering off the menu, chose a salad which wasn't good, but there is very little that you could class as healthy.",2,2014,07,09
245,Great Location & Value For Money,"Great Hotel with value for money, excellent location for airport and convenient for city access or shopping in Blanchardstown. Good Quality Food served in the Breakfast Room and friendly staff on hand to help",5,2014,07,08
245,Beware of extra charges,"Beware of extra charges.
Our room included breakfast but when I checked out they charged extra for breakfast.
I am now in a dispute with them over it. I believe they have a bad business practice and dupe people into extra charges.
64 euros for breakfast, is about $90. Absolute discrace!!
Bad on you radisson - we will not be back.",1,2014,07,07
245,Nice but let down by a few niggles.,"Really nice hotel in a great location for catching an early morning flight. Staff are very friendly and attentive. Food great and the free shuttle to the terminal is a godsend.

However, as I had booked a business class room there are a few niggles that disappointed me. Firstly the look on the toilet door was on the outside of the door, meaning anyone wanting privacy in the bathroom couldn't have it. There were three of us staying yet we were only left one bathrobe. And, one he website it states continental breakfast starts at 06:30 yet was told at reception breakfast doesn't start until 07:00.",3,2014,07,06
245,Better ask for air conditioned room.,"Expected air conditioning in a hotel of this size.  Leaving the windows open made for a very noisy sleepless night because of the airport traffic.  When we asked if there were any air conditioned rooms, we were told ""Oh, Yes.  You have to pay more for those in our Business Class rooms.",2,2014,07,05
245,Radisson,"Well run, clean and close to the airport. Check in and check out were all seamless. Location to the airport was very convenient and made our early morning departure easy. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling through Dublin. This also made it convenient to catch the bus into town for dinner and an easy return.",5,2014,07,04
245,Best Airport hotel,"Had a short stay here before early morning flight in June ...arrived after 10pm and just managed to get to my room and have time to get last orders in at the restaurant...food was delish and service excellent...room was large and very clean, comfortable bed and bed linens good quality ..very quiet had great nights sleep...best of the airport hotels for sure !",5,2014,07,04
245,Perfect for an airport stay,"Whenever I need to stay at the airport I always use the Radisson Blu Hotel. It is in  an convienent location and a complementary shuttle bus runs to and from the airport.  The rooms are spacious and beds are extremely comfortable.  The bar is a good size and the food is lovely.  I had the steak and it was divine, as it is cooked to order they inform you it might be a 20 minutes wait for the food depedning on how well you like the steak done which is great.  Staff are extremely helpful and polite and the hotel iteself is spotless.
I would have no hesitation to return to this hotel.",4,2014,07,04
245,Good location ,"This hotel was in a very convenient location because it was near the airport. The staff were professional and the hotel was clean. The room was big, as well as the bed. The toilet was difficult to flush and there was no shower curtain. But it was really convenient to wake up and go right to the airport around the corner. ",3,2014,06,30
245,Ok,Upon our arrival we were a bit sceptical of the hotel dur to a rowdy teenage party going on in the foyer. The rest of oir stay was fine. The rooms and bedding were clean and we had a quiet nights sleep. ,4,2014,06,29
245,OK but needs to be renovated,"I spent one night here, due to flying back to the US the next day.  It wasn't quite the Radisson Blu's that I've seen in the past. The lobby itself was very nice looked updated, but that is where it ended, the rooms were very outdated, like something from the 60's or 70's.  The bed was comfortable and even being close to the airport, I didn't really hear alot of planes (could be because I live next to the Indy airport and I'm used to it).  I would probably stay here again the night before a flight, they just need renovation.",3,2014,06,28
245,NEVER AGAIN,"We chose this airport hotel based on good reviews and it's close proximity to Dublin airport.  As our flight was due to arrive after midnight, I made a call earlier in the day from Italy to confirm our reservation of 2 standard rooms.  Everything was confirmed.  Upon arrival at the hotel around 1 am, the front desk checked two of us into one room, then proceeded to tell our friend that due to ""system error"" the hotel does  not have a room for her.  She was to wait for a taxi to take her to another hotel 15 minutes away......by herself......in the middle of the night......

It was obvious that the hotel was overbooked and they were shuffling the the non-corporate account guests around.  

We opted to stay with our friend and we all went to another hotel for the night.  By the time we took a taxi and got ourselves checked in, it was well passed 2 am.  

Yes, they sorted us out; yes, they were extremely apologetic; but we will never stay with Radisson again.

P.s.  I should've read the 1 star reviews from other travelers beforehand......it seems this is a reoccurring problem with this hotel.",1,2014,06,28
245,Avoid like the plague,"We went to check in for 2 rooms. One room was checked in and then the other party was told there were no rooms available! They intended on splitting the one booking. At 01:15am in the morning. And this was after we rang from Italy to confirm our booking.  

Never again!!!",1,2014,06,25
245,Excellent,"We had a wonderful stay with excellent food, the staff were excellent, always ready to help and gave great advise. Room was great very clean with crisp fresh bed clothes we could not have asked for better.",5,2014,06,23
245,Great Option at the Dublin Airport,"This hotel (the only one, I believe) is actually on the airport property and is a very easy walk to the terminal (or you can take the courtesy shuttle bus).  Free wifi is available throughout the hotel and the hotel restaurant is actually quite good.  We returned our rental car the evening before and the rental car shuttle bus dropped us off right at the hotel.  What service!",4,2014,06,23
245,600ft from airport,"This hotel is beautiful & close to the airport,it has a free nice shuttle,it took only a few mins for the shuttle to show up & it's about a 50 second ride to the hotel,our room had a king size bed & a sleeper sofa,it has a great breakfast buffet & great staff that we're more than willing to go the extra mile to help,lobby is big & inviting & elevators are very fast & big enough for our entire party & luggage,the bar was great also,was looking for a soda machine & bartender gave me 2 bottles of coke to take with & glasses of ice,I will book this hotel again no question,also have a wonderful espresso machine in the room, this was great as I used it the following morning before our flight,the bathroom is full sized,large bath tub & shower,with great water pressure & hot water,love this place! ",4,2014,06,22
245,Try to sleep!!!,"As I had a early flight I decided to stay at Radisson Blu Hotel at the airport but I made a great mistake...We are at century 21 and this hotel does not have air conditioning system nor ventilation. I opened the window but I couldn't sleep because of the tremendous noise coming from the traffic of cars and planes. Please, if you have an early flight, DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL or you will not sleep like me.",2,2014,06,21
245,terrible,"awful service, poor staff, terrible restaurant, the t3 bar and restaurant has inedible food. I ordered the red thai chicken curry and when I took my first bite there was a big bone in the chicken. It took 45 minutes for the food to come out. It is very hard to connect to the wifi, the tv has very poor to no service which is always skipping. There is no shop in or near the hotel for snacks. The rooms are small and the bathrooms are very cluttered. If i could rate this less than a 1 star it would satisfy my feelings for this hotel.",1,2014,06,21
245,Good Beds,"We enjoyed a great night at the Radisson Blu. Our room was larger than the average, well furnished, bright, clean and smelled fresh. The best part, it had one of the best beds and it felt like the one we have at home. Staff was excellent and the breakast buffet had lots of items to choose from. They have a 7/24 airport shuttle. Good location if you're traveling by air.",4,2014,06,19
245,"Spectacular service, great airport location.","Stayed in this hotel because of the location. It's *right* next to the airport, with a shuttle bus running every 10 minutes. Was surprised that there wasn't much air traffic noise. Surprised by the high quality of food at the restaurant and breakfast buffet. Most of all, I was amazed by the quality of the service. I was being an unusually needy guest, and was met with nothing but sweet, attentive, efficient, over-the-top helpful employees. I mean, INCREDIBLE service. 
The rooms were slightly grungy, mostly because they could do with a serious update. They DO have aircon- the controls are a bit tricky is all. If you're flying in or out of Dublin, you should definitely stay here.",4,2014,06,19
245,Great airport location,"Stayed here for one night before our flight the next morning.  Room was large, bed was comfortable and the air conditioner worked very well (quite surprising)!  The shower leaked onto the floor but otherwise worked well.  There was plenty of vanity space. Restaurant served great breakfast and dinner.  The hotel is located on the grounds of the Dublin airport so it is extremely convenient.  The hotel shuttle leaves every 10-15 minutes so getting to the terminal is very quick and easy.  The hotel was a good value and we would definitely stay here again.",4,2014,06,19
245,Great Airport Location,"Nice modern airport location a bout 200 yards from the front of the Dublin Airport Terminal 2.  Easy to get to with adequate signage once you enter the airport complex.  Shuttle service is provided by the Radisson every 10 minutes 24 hours a day.  Medium sized room with a desk, double bed, and small closet space.  No luggage rack in the room.  A little warm but A/C worked great.  Wifi was excellent.  Breakfast buffet was good.  Dinner selections were extensive.  Had Cod and Chips with a pint of Guiness--excellent.  The staff were professional and friendly.  The fixtures in the room were a little worn but worked adequately.  The shower/bath combination was a little leaky.  Plenty of electric outlets in the room.  Tends to be a bit pricey for the hotel but OK for the location.  I definitely would stay here again if flying out of Dublin.",4,2014,06,19
245,No aircon in room!!!,"Waited a while for check in as a few other arrivals just before me.  Checkin was seamless enough, staff pleasant.  

No air conditioning in the room I was in, at all....it was a roasting hot day, had to sleep with window open which didn't really make any impact whatsoever.  Not ideal at an airport hotel!!!

As a frequent business traveller it does drive me potty when there is no water in room or anything in mini bar... I trotted down to the bar to get a bottle of water which I was charged €5.50 for!!

I do stay at airport hotels often...it's unlikely I will return here. ",2,2014,06,18
245,You could walk to departures.,"This is another top class Radisson Blu hotel. A great location near enough to the airport to walk to departures (not that there is any need as the shuttle bus leaves every thirty minutes) with all the normal amenities expected of a Radisson hotel.

The rooms are a good size with all the added extras. Restaurant food and breakfast are top class and top quality. All staff members add to your stay with their professionalism.",5,2014,06,18
245,overnight stay,Myself & my elderly sister stayed the night here before heading to the airport early the next morning. We had a lovely meal in ODeas bar & then had breakfast delivered to our room in the morning. The food was excellent & the staff were lovely & very helpful.,5,2014,06,18
245,"Breakfast scam, Rude customer service, expensive local calls","My family stayed here on an unplanned trip change.
I actually booked in the lobby and was told one price with no breakfast, another with breakfast for fifteen bux more. I tried to ask the lady what was on the breakfast (needed kids stuff, not blood sausage) and she didnt really give me a descriptive answer. After a few minutes with distractions of kids and other people being helped i didnt know which one i booked. Figured i'd just ask in the morning since i hadnt slept in 20 hours.

Next morning i did that, asked the breakfast attendant how much breakfast was or if i got it included. she asked my room number and said yes, we got the bedNbreakfast rate. so we ate a bowl of cereal and a peice of toast, no tea or coffee in sight. I then checked out to find i was charged thirty-two euros for my cereal. I explained what had happened and the front desk refused to correct the issue. Having the bus waiting for me i couldnt argue.
Also they tried to sneak charging me in dollars with a crazy exchange rate instead of euros , lucky i caught them
Local calls are 75c min, as well.",2,2014,06,17
245,Solid,"If you need to stay at the airport in Dublin, this is a good spot.  You can literally walk to the terminal if you want to.  Room was spacious and first rate.  As you might expect, it's noisy.  As with many Irish hotels, the only way to cool off the room is to open the window but the flight traffic was not very heavy.",4,2014,06,15
245,Great place to stay with flight the next day,"We arrived around 9:15pm, grabbed a bite to eat in the restaurant (closes at 10:30). Room was really nice, staff was too.  Only stayed one night because we had a flight back to US the next day. The breakfast buffet was very extensive and included in the rate.",5,2014,06,15
245,Great stay for last night in Ireland,"We booked here because of our flight the next day.  I expected it to be good and it was.  Check in was effortless and we got the upgraded room we had requested.  My brother and his wife were with us as well and the kind staff forgave my forgetting that they were reserved under his name.  

Room was really quiet.  Nice for an airport hotel.

Loved the breakfast.  Excellent service and excellent selection of food.  The 4 of us all had different things and remarked how good it all was.

One complaint...the fire alarm went off at 2am or so.  To their credit it was silenced immediately.  The next morning the person checking us out was apologetic and guessed that a guest was testing out the ""no smoking"" rule.  I hope they got fined.",5,2014,06,13
245,A hotel not for travellers... in an airport!!,"When you book a hotel in an airport is probably because you arrive late or you leave early or both. 
Well, maybe they haven't undestood this in this hotel, because when I arrived at midnight there was no restaurant, no room service, nowhere to grab anything to eat... and neither to drink, there is not even a single bottle of water in the minibar!! It's quite useful to have an empty minibar in the room.

After that I was trying to update some work stuff for the next days' meetings, but suddenly the lights went off in the room and I wasn't able for any means to turn them on again. I decided to end the suffering going to bed.

Well, at least the bed was confortable...

The morning after, at 6:00 same thing happens, breakfast no where to be seen, I had to take a bus for a three hour trip after a five hour sleep with no dinner and no breakfast. Ready for action!

An advice, you probably sleep better inside the airport terminal.",1,2014,06,13
245,This hotel operates an overbooking policy. Beware.,"Booked one night's accommodation for this hotel (11th of June, 2014). I was due to arrive at the Hotel at midnight. I was slightly concerned that this was very late, so I phoned them before my trip to ensure that my late arrival wouldn't be a problem.  They assured me that this was fine. The desk would be open 24 hours.

Sure enough, it was open when I arrived. However, there was no room for me. They had overbooked. To be fair, they paid for a taxi, and walked me to another hotel of comparable quality.

Still, not what you want to happen when you've just stepped off a late flight from Sicily. Won't be making this mistake again.",1,2014,06,12
245,Fantastic Staff,"Had an overnight here before an early flight and normally I kind of dismiss airport hotels but the staff I met on this visit were pretty fantastic and credit where credit is due & all that.. They were just so polite, helpful & when leaving the following morning, I'm guessing the restaurant manager couldn't have been nicer. I just wanted to grab a take away breakfast but she really went beyond the usual pointing me in the direction of where to get things. 
I ate in the bar the night previous and can definitely compliment their Merlot and chowder (not quite the right mix I know!), but equally so good!
Rooms were good and spacious with a nice comfortable bed. I was in 114 which is facing the airport and over the main entrance and even with the traffic, I managed a good nights sleep. I would recommend a higher floor or asking them for a quieter room if you are a light sleeper. 
The bathroom did have a cracked tile but didn't seem loose or that would cause injury and it was very clean. 
There was no delay in the coach to the airport in the morning either, two drivers doing the route meant no waiting which was so convenient. 
I definitely will be booking in here if I'm flying early again from Dublin.",5,2014,06,12
245,Conveninet Location,Convenient Location from airport. They have free airport transfer facility. Rooms are specious. Restaurant has wide varity but pure veg food options are limited. There is also bar. They also have meeting rooms.,5,2014,06,07
245,Business rooms ill-equipped,Friendly check in and was given upgrade to a business class room which was bright and clean BUT only one plug/outlet on the very small desk which already had coffee maker and electric kettle and telephone on it. One outlet hidden behind TV and inaccessible so it was impossible to work and charge laptop and cellphones at same time.No bedside outlets. Only a shaver socket in bathroom. Restaurant was just adequate but not good enough for a hotel with Radisson reputation. Very convenient for airport but could be a lot better.,3,2014,06,02
245,Slightly disappointed,Upon arrival the staff were polite and freindly its just that I've always liked the thought of stay here. The reception lobby didn't disappointed the problem was that the room was ultra basic. There were cracks in the decore of the bathroom. The bedroom was just drab and didn't feel anything like a semi plush hotel.,3,2014,06,01
245,Radisson Dublin Airport,Hotel not quiet up to the standard I have come to expect from the Radisson chain.  Rooms were adequate and clean and good for just an overnight stay. No ambience in lobby or bar which is very impersonal with no sense of warmth usually found in irish pubs. In the resturant service was slow and we had to attract the waiter's attention any time we wanted to order or pay the bill.  We ordered fish and chips as this was our last night in Ireland. Very disappointing. Fish was very greasy and had more batter than fish.Could not finish. Chips were frozen. Hotel is adequate for overnight stay for early morning flights but would look for another place to eat.,3,2014,05,31
245,Problem quickly resolved.,Arrived with standard room booked.  Pleasant enough but noticed rubbish on the table. I put this in the bin which also had rubbish in it. Went to the bathroom to see if bath or shower or both. Last guests towels still there and dirty sink. Phoned reception to ask someone to clean but I was asked to go down and get a key to a room. Profuse apology from reception and went back upstairs to find I had been given an upgraded suite. Within 10 mins there was a knock and the manager gave me a slip for a free meal. The original room was pleasant enough but the upgrade was very nice. Nescafe coffee machine and dressing gown and slippers!! Thanks for resolving the problem so quickly. I then slept very well. ,4,2014,05,29
245,Poor effort,"We elected to stay at an airport hotel after our 2 week stay in Ireland as we had an early flight to Germany and this seemed a good way to deal with that.  It was the most expensive accommodation that we had booked, so we expected something good.  Unfortunately we were disappointed.  I looked at the price list on the outside of the mini bar and thought that I would check it out.  I opened the door and found it completely empty and iced up. Why bother having it there and turned on if there's nothing in it.  

The bath had a big chip out of it and there were plugs remaining in the tiles where somthing had been attached at some time.

The beds and pillows were hard.

We had ordered an early room service  breakfast (4:30am).  You would thing that being an airport hotel and having breakfast mandatorily included in the tariff, that the dining room might be open to accommodate early flights!  By 4:40 breakfast hadn't arrived.  We rang and were told that it was on the way.  It arrived at around 4:45.  For an airport hotel punctuality should be number 1 priority.",2,2014,05,28
245,No room at the inn!,"Unfortunately I am unable to rate our stay at this hotel even though we booked 2 rooms for 4 adults staying 24 May until 25, many weeks ago through booking.com on our arrival just after midnight  we were told one of the rooms was unavailable. As we had travelled with family flying in from the canaries we did not want to stay in two different hotels (one of our party has health problems and is awaiting major surgery). The staff were unhelpful and claimed the problem was caused by the computer overbooking. Eventually we were transported by their shuttle bus (without even being offered any refreshments during our wait) to another hotel near croke which was hosting an after concert reception, we were met at the door by patroons falling out drunk and teenagers in bedrooms banging doors, all together a disappointing end to what had been a wonderful holiday. Chose this hotel due to close proximity to terminal and having stayed in Radisson BLU in other parts of the world we felt its standard very good utterly disappointed! Dessy A",1,2014,05,27
245,Radisson Blue dublin airport,"A good airport location. friendly staff and value for money. A good stop-off if you are using the airport. Also reasonably convenient to Dublin city centre.. 30 minute bus ride approximately. Got ataxi to city centre for 17 Euros. Lots to do and see in Dublin . Good spot for an overnight or indeed 2 or 3 days, if you are travelling via the airport. Immediate access to M1 and M50 motorways.",4,2014,05,26
245,Car Park Charges,"Went to Radisson Blue Dublin Airport for evening meal.
The food was very good and the service was as good.
However. When we finished dinning and had a few after drinks we were appalled at the car park charges upon leaving.
We like to support local business whenever possible. When I asked for the car park ticket to be validated I was told that dinning customers need to pay for car park. I entered my ticket into the machine and was appalled when the charge was €8.00.
I complained about the charge and was told that they agree that the charges were very high but that was the Hotel Policy.
Food.... Very Good
Service... Very Good
Reason to return... NIL
We will not be returning and will pass on our disgust to Friends with the same idea of Local Business Support",1,2014,05,25
245,Free sauna in every room (well at least room 134),"Opted to stay here as early flight out of Dublin airport and the property is within walking distance of the terminals.  Although you can easily see the hotel walking there (instructions on the website of where to get the shuttle bus and signage in the airport were all poor) is another matter.  Seems the airport blew all their money on the terminal building as pavements/sidewalks just seem to disappear if you decide to walk.

Check in was fine and up to the room, which was baking hot.  And I mean roasting.  Sauna is a very good description.  The next couple of hours were going to be spent getting different stories trying to fix this.  The full story of that fiasco is at the end.  But as for the rest of the hotel not worth the price:

* No alarm clock or clock of any description in the room.  Nothing on the TV for a wake up call either or anything automated on the phone.  However, they do do wake up calls.  Odd for an airport hotel not to have any of this

* For our American cousins, the beds are very small.  I would say it was a standard UK double which is way smaller than those in North America

* The decor is very tired and dated and you can see that the hotel has very high occupancy with stains on the carpets in the corridors

* Cheap mattress without much support

* Plenty of sockets at the desk (both UK/Irish and non UK) which was good (Internet worked well too) but the chair was way lower than the desk which would have made any longer period of working uncomfortable

I didn't try any of the rest of the hotel so you'll have to read other reviews for that.  For the rate paid this was a very, very average hotel, but maybe the free sauna and the amount they must be wasting on electricity was what made it expensive?

If you are just here for the night, perfectly OK but plenty of other options which you might be better to try.  I had a horrible nights sleep as the room was baking hot.

So, to the saga of the sauna.  Turned the a/c on.  Nothing coming out of the vents.  Now, I travel a lot and I know it takes a bit of time for a/c to kick in, but just nothing was coming out.  The radiator in the room was blasting out so much heat I was sure that Ireland had installed a nuclear power station to run it.

Now the phone calls start.  The first of three.  Porter appears and tells me that I have to wait for it to kick in (really - like I've never done this before?) and turning the a/c on will turn the radiator off.  But you know where this is heading don't you?

Anyway, the long and the short of it (three varying stories later) is that despite being told the raditor had been turned off it is still roasting.  Told the hotel is full and no other rooms.  Essentially like it or lump it.  So, unpack, open the window even more and start to unwind. 

The second person that appeared was more concerned with saying that it was not his personal fault that the a/c wasn't working.  I acknowledged that, but he was the hotel as far as I was concerned and that, I think sums up the approach of the staff.  We're full, you're an idiot because you don't how our a/c system works. 

At this point just as I've got comfortable someone appears with the offer of another room.  By this time unpacked and packing up again is way to much hassle.  The radiator (despite being told it had been turned off) is still belting out heat as I left the room.

On the plus side I have never been so happy to be up early for a flight.  Getting outside of the room and in to cooler air was bliss.  

Adequate at best and lots of other options around that you'd be better to explore.",2,2014,05,25
245,Oustanding Business Hotel,"I just completed conducting training for a client at the Radisson Blu Dublin Airport.
I have conducted training all over the globe and this Hotel stands out as one of the most service oriented I have ever been to. The Service staff almost literally ""jumped"" when asked.
Each morning when I started training earlier than planned I would call for our schedule coffee/tea service. Instead of being told"" Oh. it will take us a few minutes, sir"" it was "" yes, sir, right away"" and before I could hang up the phone and walk out of the room Julian or one of the other service staff was already there setting it up. It was truly amazing. There was never a problem that couldn't be fixed and fixed right then and there.
The food at the "" Carvery"" T3 was surprisingly good. The gravy's and sauces rivaled those of my German grandfather who was a master chef. I had always been told that "" hell is where the Irish are the Chefs"" was totally wrong. 
The rooms are very large for Europe , clean and appointed nicely. All a business traveler could want.
Should we return to the Emerald Isle for business I will insist we use the Radisson Blu again.
If you need anything Elaine, and her well trained staff will be there to provide it.
Great Job !",5,2014,05,23
245,Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport,"Most convenient hotel to Dublin Airport. Reception area very cordial and efficient. Business class room was large, well appointed and a very good value. Very quiet. Staff very attentive and transport to terminal excellent.  Will definitely stay here again when using Dublin airport.",4,2014,05,23
245,Poor experience - did not get what I paid for,"Stayed here with my husband couple of weeks ago ahead of an early morning flight and unfortunately left extremely disappointed. We arrived late, around 9pm; the check in was quick, the hotel is quite modern and really lovely, with great lounge for meetings etc and a nice bar. The free shuttle was a big plus - it departs from the Buses Terminal at T1 and only takes few minutes to get to the hotel. We got a Business Class room and it was comfy, clean and quite spacious. The bathroom was basic but very clean and nothing wrong with it, so our first impression was very very positive. It turned out their internet wasn't working for most of the evening, it only came back very late and therefore we were not able to use it much. Because of the early flight, we asked about breakfast (was supposed to be included in our rate) at check-in and were told it will be available no problem as a grab&go option. In the morning the check out was very quick (good overall service) but the breakfast turned out to be coffee & tea to go, a pile of apples and a plate with one chocolate bar on it which was gone by the time we checked out. As there were couple of other people departing on the same shuttle bus, you could tell other people were also disgusted with this ""breakfast to go"" as there was literally nothing to grab at 5 am (other than coffee). I felt the hotel was very nice overall, but as an airport property it serves a very different purpose than e.g. a city or beach hotel. We chose this particular hotel for this night for 3 reasons: free shuttle (check!), free WiFi to connect to friends & family and check up on further holiday plans and reservations etc (Internet not working = no bookings confirmed) and breakfast included & available at 4-5am so that we don't have to eat at the airport (grab&go was a joke here and on top of that the staff were not prepared for the shuttle bus departure - didn't even put more breakfast bars after they were all gone). Anyway, out of the three reasons for choosing Radisson, two of them were not available to us during our stay. Because of this I feel like I did not get what I paid for (and chosen this hotel for) and therefore the poor rating of this otherwise nice hotel. I was very disappointed with our short stay at Radisson and will not be returning nor recommending this hotel to anyone.",2,2014,05,21
245,Great location and friendly service,I chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. I needed to check in early and staff were friendly and helpful and found a clean room in one minute. The 24 hour shuttle to the airport is an added bonus.,4,2014,05,18
245,Not what we expected.,"We were so disappointed with our stay here. The room was very warm and stuffy with no temperature control/air con. The bath/shower did not drain sufficiently while taking a shower, this was very uncomfortable. The toilet did not flush properly, it took a few attempts! 
We had dinner in the hotel, it was just ok as was the breakfast. We were not very impressed and will stay in a different airport hotel in the future.",3,2014,05,17
245,Great pre flight hotel!,"Stayed here prior to our transatlantic flight. Great choice! 
Nice bar and really comfortable room! 
Breakfast was excellent also. 
Good service from friendly staff. 
Great value for money! 
Will definitely return when flying out of Dublin. ",5,2014,05,13
245,Good service and well located,"One night stay here as the other Radisson Blue hotels in Dublin were fully booked - reasonable parking rates overnight made it good value to stay here. Courteous and helpful service at check-in, but unfortunately the room (business class) was very disappointing as compared to other Radisson Blu hotels in Ireland/UK. Clean and comfortable, but decor was rather dated and the room comparatively small. Signage addressed the issue of decor, apparently an update is due in 2014/2015. Limited breakfast choice for vegetarians, no hot option apart from fried potato. Still a good choice for airport travel, but would not stay here again when visiting Dublin. No complaints apart from the high standard established by other Radisson Blu hotels!",3,2014,05,13
245,Great airport hotel,"I stayed  in this hotel on a number of occasions,lovely bedrooms,staff and excellent food .There are transfers payed on to the airport which is very handy .Breakfast very healthy and plenty of it.Will stay there again",5,2014,05,13
245,Excellent,"Regularly stay here when I have an early departure / late arrival at the airport.
Clean. Comfortable. Nice rooms. Excellent internet connection. Good basic food.
Friendly staff. Regular shuttle to/from airport.
Ability to leave car at hotel when travelling at reasonable rates. Would strongly recommend.",5,2014,05,11
245,Very Good,"Stayed here as we had a early morning flight to Naples. Arrived late and we were greeted by very friendly staff. Room was beautiful. Made it to the bar for a quick drink. After a hectic day we asked if there was any food. A wonderful barman, Martin, recommended a pizza and it was delicious, better than anything we had in Italy. Overall a wonderful experience.",5,2014,05,07
245,Wonderful Staff!,"Myself and my husband stayed here the night after our wedding as we had an early flight the next morning. We arrived just as the food finished up in the hotel bar however  the friendly bar man took our order and pushed it through! I had hurt my hand on my wedding day and was not in the best of form to say the least however both the bar man and the porter could not have been more helpful, the porter offered to get me some paracetamol if I was in pain with the bar man giving us a free drink to celebrate our recent wedding and my damaged hand!
I can't thank them enough, the hotel should be proud to have such attentive and genuine staff. We will definitely be recommending the hotel to our friends.",5,2014,05,06
245,Close to Airport,"Reserved a room through travel agent because of proximity to airport and 24 hour shuttle service.  After dropping the car at Hertz we were waiting for the shuttle that was supposed to come every 15 minutes for nearly an hour. (330pm)  The driver that finally arrived was apologetic and said he had just come on duty.  When we got to room the A/C did not work.  We were eventually moved and ""upgraded"" to a Business Class room.  Website indicates international power points however none were available during our stay.

The rooms we had were clean and beds were comfortable however the service level was mediocre for the most part.  If you want to be close to the airport this is likely your only choice.  Breakfast buffet was good but way overpriced.",3,2014,05,05
245,Ideal for airport access,"We had an early flight and booked a room here.  I took the junior suite upgrade option and we ended up with a suite.  The kids loved the jacuzzi, and after a long and noisy drive, it was great to have so much room.  The kids sat in the window and watched airplanes for hours.

All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  

The near airport location was fantastic.  We were able to get rid of our rental car the night before our flight and just took the shuttle to the hotel.  Saved even more time in the morning.

The hotel makes a real effort to be sure that everyone can get breakfast no matter how early their flight, with full breakfast service starting early and a grab and go from somewhere around 3am.",5,2014,05,05
245,"Good hotel, ideal for airport","Stayed here rebirth before I flew back to the UK. Situated in the airport grounds, shuttle bus runs every few minutes. Secure car park but you need to pay for it, I would give 5 stars if hotel guests parked for free. If you're not in a car then it's irrelevant. 

Clean, decent bar and friendly staff. 

Would stay again ",4,2014,05,04
245,Easy airport access,"We stayed here before an early morning flight and were very happy. All the staff we met were friendly and professional. We had an enjoyable drink in the bar and while we did not eat there the food looked good. The room was very clean and comfortable. The next morning Bismark checked us out efficiently and directed us to the buffet table for juice, coffee and cereal bars. If it had not been raining so heavily we would have walked to the terminal however we used the shuttle and the courteous driver dropped us at T2's door. A lovely touch was the Butler's Easter egg awaiting us in the room- thank you very much. We will certainly return here.",5,2014,05,01
245,"Nice location, rooms ok-ish.....no air conditioning!","Nice location hotel near the airport if that what you need. Nice modern hotel however rooms are sub standard and for some reason, the rooms have no air conditioning! So had to sleep with the window open at an ""airport"" hotel......one guess what woke me up!",3,2014,05,01
245,Not bad for an airport hotel but a bit bland,We stayed here on Easter Sunday night as we had a very early flight in the morning. Check in was a bit slow as the staff (very helpfully) took time out to explain to everyone how to connect to their wifi if they had a tablet rather than a laptop. Our room was like an oven as the radiator couldn't be turned off. Whenever you have an issue like this I always wonder why they send someone who doesn't know anything about the actual problem to investigate. In the end they put us into another room but it took about 45 minutes before we got everything sorted. I will stay again if the price is right (which it was on this occasion).,3,2014,05,01
245,Good for early flights from Dublin,"After previous stays at the other Radisson Blu Hotels, this one was rather a disappointment. Already at the reception, one of the receptionists was rather abrupt. Room itself was spacey but somehow not really ""inviting"". The mattress was smelling mold. The only advantage that it is located close to the airport.",3,2014,04,30
245,Unbelievable Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport on Monday, April 21st, the night before we flew out of Dublin. We are so glad we did. Upon check-in the front desk staff were super friendly and allowed us to check in early. When we got to the room we could not believe how spacious and clean it was. Much better than any other place we stayed in Ireland for the past 12 days. The shower pressure was strong and the bathroom was beautiful with over sized towels and bathrobe. There was a refrigerator in the room which was a first for Ireland. We actually had wooden hangers to hang up our clothes. We decided to eat in the restaurant downstairs. We had the absolutely most delicious seafood chowder with brown bread that we have ever had in Ireland outside of Sullivan's Tavern in Tralee. Big chunks of fish, mussels and crab in a white creamy broth. Ummm!!
When we return to Dublin we plan on staying at the Radisson Blu all week and take the bus into Dublin everyday instead of staying at a over priced, dirty hotel in the center of the city. Also the Radisson has a shuttle service to the airport across the street but if you travel light, as we do, you can walk across the street to the airport just as easily.

245,Raddison hotel review,I found my stay in the hotel very enjoyable and staff very helpful.  I had to book at the last minute and the hotel staff were very accomodating and met all my needs.  I was travelling for business and my flight was delayed coming into Dublin,4,2014,04,29
245,Not dublin finest,"The best thing about the hotel is the location nearby the airport. Food in restaurant was i guess from the freezer ( had fish and chips) but served by friendly staff. 
Room was outdated, but with good bed. There was no way to solve the heath in the room, so only solution was to open windows which is not very nice being almost at the airport. The wifi worked good, but if you want some water in your room, you had to pay 3,50 euro. 
The final disappointment was the gym. Not in the hotel but 10 minutes walk and not open late in evening. 

Next time i take the taxi ride for granted from st helens. A better hotel despite the old fashion looks.",3,2014,04,28
245,Great,"Great place to stay! We do recomend this Hotel to anyone. Freindly staff, clean rooms, we had a fantastic time. The rooms were a nice size and we will be returning, Thank you Radisson for a great time.",5,2014,04,27

Well what can we say? The meal was absolutely delicious. I had a starter of goats cheese encased in a light puff pastry with a pesto dressing with toasted walnut and salad - lovely combinations of flavours. My partner had Howth smoked salmon which was lovely

. Then the main courses were Catch of the Day and Steak. Both dishes were cooked to perfection - lovely and hot .

Our waiter Jack was a delightful young man. He was very attentive and pleasant.

We have read several reviews which criticise the food at the Radisson but we would certainly return .",5,2014,04,25
245,convenient and comfortable for airport,"I always stay here when flying back to the US from Dublin.  You can drop off your rental car and save the extra day.  The hotel is basically on the airport campus and the shuttle is fast and frequent.  Comfortable and private, nice rooms.  Seems like good enough value at 88euro.",5,2014,04,23
245,Standard Airport Hotel,"Close to airport, rooms are standard and bathrooms are small. The menu in the bar/restaurant is quite good. Reception staff are very efficient and good shuttle service early in the morning but close enough to walk to.",4,2014,04,21
245,Room service terrible,"I stayed in this hotel recently and the bedroom itself was fine with a really good sized bed which was comfortable.The thing that let them down was the room service as I ordered a plate of ham and cheese toasted sandwiches and what arrived was cold and damp fare with the cheapest bread imaginable.They even had the audacity to demand payment even though I wasn't checking out till next morning and my accommodation and breakfast was pre paid by my company.I have no complaints about the waiter as he did his best in the circumstances but due to company policy the room service had to be paid immediately.I understand that it is normal practice in hotels worldwide to take an imprint of ones credit card in case of incidental expenses but they didn't request this at my time of checkin which was around 10.30 PM. As I was hungry I ate the sandwiches but on reflection I ought not to have paid for such poor quality.By contract the breakfast was excellent and the Chef when requested by me  kindly made me up a ham and mushroom omelette which was one of the tastiest I ever had and the staff couldn't have been better so it was a case of 2 contrasts.The usual Irish breakfast didn't look too appealing however, and I would advise any would be guest to ask for chef to cook an omelette and they also make porridge if this is required.The shuttle bus is very handy and the driver was most courteous and helpful.It is convenient if you arrive late from a foreign flight or if you have an early flight and the price is quite high.",3,2014,04,18
245,Good for the airport,"Location is walking distance from the airport.  Check in was swift, price was fair - about 110 Euros to include breakfast, Wifi is free.

I found the room really hot with no way to control the heat aside from opening the window - changing the position of the thermostat on the radiator seemed to have no impact.  The windows are not sound proofed and a lot of noise from the road comes in - shame given that this is an airport hotel (not a location known for tranquillity).  Sleep was better than average - needed ear plugs.  

Bathroom is clean, a little worn at edges.  The hot water is really hot - likely scalding hot. Watch out.  Position of toilet means a very cramped seated experience.  The shower was powerful - good shower experience.

A fair measure of an airport hotel is, would you stay here if you did not need to use the airport - answer - No.",3,2014,04,15
245,Great airport Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here as we had an early morning flight. We loved it. The staff were friendly and helpful. The shuttle bus driver called us over as we were heading up to the terminal building to catch a bus into the city saying, hey we are here for you. So pleasant! We had food twice and found the prices expensive but reasonable for airport and city. It was delicious. My daughter and her partner were also staying and we stayed up until the small hours  and the staff were still lovely. In fact we didn't meet even one staff member who wasn't helpful and pleasant.Our early morning call was prompt and the grab and go was fully stocked and really convenient. We will definitely be booking here again. ",5,2014,04,12
245,Middle of road,"I have stayed here a couple of times as it is really close to the airport. Handy five minute walk from T2. There is also a shuttle bus to and from.
The staff are very nice. Hotel is quite expensive.
The rooms are nice with comfortable beds.
Breakfast is only ok. The quality of the food is poor enough. The scrambled egg (if it is egg) is tasteless. Yuk. Service was good.
I had a carvery lunch. No flavour but this is my experience with most carvery lunches.
I will stay again for convenience to airport but not for the food.",3,2014,04,12
245,"""Too hot to sleep""","Stayed in Radisson Blu with daughter last week as she was attending an interview in the Uk the following day and we needed a good night's sleep to ready us for the very early morning flight. Had booked the room well in advance requesting a quiet room with air-conditioning. Arrived to a room that was stifling hot with no air-con to be seen. Phoned down to reception who stated they would be back to us shortly. 45 minutes later we trooped down to reception, explained our position, and a very pleasant lady ( Elena?) dealt with us. She would put us in a Business Class room on 2nd floor with air-con. Job done or so we thought. Had a lovely meal in lounge and returned to room. Extremely hot  being only very slightly cooler than previous room. Tried to adjust air-con but had  no joy. Rang reception again- they would send some one to assist. Gentleman arrived but could not make the room any cooler as there are pre-set limits on system. Gave up. Spent the night in sweltering heat unable to open window due to road noise. Rose with exhausted daughter the following morning at five. At six went down stairs to catch the complimentary ""Grab and Go"" breakfast. Got one cereal bar between the two of us and luckily a bottle of water each leaving the last bottle to be fought over by the many people milling through the reception area. Fruit was available.
Management- 
1. If asking prospective guests for their ""Special Requests"" please fulfil them. If unable to do so a phone-call to that affect would have been appreciated.
2. Please don't advertise a service that is not fully available i.e. breakfast. 
3. Fully functioning air-con is not a luxury but a necessity in a hotel where you cannot open the windows.
Finally the Maldron Hotel is actually closer to the airport and a lot cheaper. Guess where I will be trying next time!",3,2014,04,08
245,Four star,"Staff lovely and efficient. Hotel very clean. Breakfast really nice, great variety. Rooms clean and new. Shower lovely. Was there for a wedding and could not fault the hotel or the staff. Would not recommend the Alsaa swimming pool however, needs to be cleaned and repaired.",5,2014,04,07
245,"great comfy beds, good food and location","We stayed at the Radisson Blu on our arrival to Dublin.  The beds were new and very comfy-made for a great rest from a long flight across the pond.  Due to weather we ended up staying in the rest of the day and ate two meals in the restaurant-both were delicious and the service was superb.  Breakfast the next morning was quite nice with a very good selection from hot to continental choices.  My only issue with the hotel would be the bathroom and toilets.  We had 2 rooms between our party and neither room had a toilet that flushed without major effort.  The rooms could use some updating and the cracked marble tabletop in my room really should be replaced.  All in all a nice hotel, staff is friendly and helpful, food is good and sleep is excellent.",4,2014,04,05
245,Grand,"Second stay here before an early morning flight, I do not know what it is about the restaurant but the room was too hot... Food fab though.. No complaints, rooms as all Radisson rooms are adequate. But for an airport hotel this one has a lovely ambiance and view of airport is actually nice too... Surprisingly I did not hear any planes...",3,2014,04,04
245,Hotel was nice enough and the free shuttle was a life saver.,"We chose to stay here for a night out in Dublin as we were flying back the following day so firstly I'd like to say how useful their free shuttle bus is which runs every 15mins in a loop around the airport (including the leisure complex if you ask them). The rooms were clean and well serviced, I stayed in a triple which was ample sized for me and two girls. The hotel comes with use of the leisure complex up the road but if I were you I wouldn't bother it is dreadful, dilapidated, unclean and the guy running the place is obnoxiously rude. On a whole though I'd recommend the hotel for a short break and would have not issue going back.",4,2014,04,04
245,"Nice staff, convenient location.","We stayed twice because of the convenient airport location. The first stay we arrived at 9:00 a.m. and they stored our bags while we took the bus to the city center. The toilet had issues, but I think it's an Irish thing cause we would pump it and it would work and we had the same thing at other Irish hotels. It worked once you learn how to do it. LOL. The check-in staff was very nice. We enjoyed the breakfast on our 2nd stay cause we had too early of a flight after the first and it was great. Staying near the airport was vital to us to have as little stress as possible and it was great that they had a family room so we could be comfortable together and not separated as a family. Ireland has a lot of family deals which I really thought was great. We were immediately assisted at the airport because we were traveling with kids and they offer family plan prices at restaurants etc. I am writing a review because I mulled over them myself before committing so maybe someone will find this helpful.",4,2014,04,02
245,Can't believe this was a Radisson,"We stayed here unexpectedly when our flight to Paris was cancelled. The staff was pleasant and got us into a room rather quickly. However, the dial to adjust the temperature was broken. The room was cold. The toilet wouldn't flush. We went down to the desk and mentioned that the toilet needed maintenance while we had dinner. After dinner we stopped at the desk and were told that it would take at least an hour to fix and it was broken, ""just flushed hard"". We requested another room. They obliged without delay. We were moved to a ""business class"" room.  We were ready for bed and went to close the curtains. The whole thing fell down! Glad we were only there one night! Definitely not up to Radisson standards and wouldn't stay here again. In fact, if our flight was cancelled again we already agreed that we would go to another nearby hotel!!",2,2014,03,30
245,Great hotel next to the airport,Perfect location next to the terminal. Good quality rooms at a great price. Surprised how quiet it was as I couldn't even hear the airport.  They have a shuttle to both terminals every 15 mins although they're so close you could walk in a few mins.,5,2014,03,30
245,Radisson Dublin Airport,Great location. On the airport campus. Timely Shuttle service. Extremely helpful staff. Fast and efficient service in bar and restaurant. Room service timely and great quality. Good value for money. Rooms modern and clean,4,2014,03,27
245,Airport Stay,The room was very clean and comfortable.  The service exceeded expectations.  The food and service were a pleasant welcome after a long day of travel.   The shuttle service relieved us of the stress of returning the rental car the morning of our flight.  We were treated very well in every aspect of our stay.,5,2014,03,25
245,Good location for Airport,"Stayed here a couple of times as its handy for the airport.

Mind you can expect to wait 15 mins for a shuttle.

It is walking distance if you only have a back pack.

Just had seafood chowder and a super salad, both wonderful!
In fact if close by I would return just to eat those!

Bar staff efficient, reception can be variable but guess they don't get tips.

Business room bright and airy with coffee machine and whole hotel is free wifi which works!",4,2014,03,24
245,Use only for early flight convenience,"I stayed here one night just before an early flight out the next day. And I must say for that it was a godsend being so close to the terminals. Convenience is the raison d'etre of this hotel, but I really cannot say that I would stay here for any other reason",2,2014,03,23
245,Ignore the bad reviews,"We stayed for one night before getting an early flight to London. The pickup at the airport arrived within seconds of us going to the stand. The driver was helpful and pleasant. The checkin staff were a pleasure to deal with and the Hotel lobby was spacious, clean and modern.
Our room was fantastic,there was a big comfy bed a spacious bathroom with a shower a and bath. Business desk, extra chairs, plenty of storage and a good tv package.Everything was spotless, new and modern. 
We ate in the restaurant, which was not great. The staff were friendly, the service was good but it is fairly pricey  for what you get. Don't expect any main courses for under 15 euro, for what is basically canteen food, frozen chips and all. 
The transfer to the airport the next morning was again faultless, a helpful cheery driver, considering it was 4.30 am he was in great spirits. The hotel lay on tea, coffee, fruit and water for those getting an early transfer which is a nice touch. 
Would. to hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to others but I would probably give the restaurant a swerve.",5,2014,03,22
245,Overpriced and disappointing,"Was left waiting for a shuttle bus for 45 mins that never came. Called twice and assured it was coming but don't. So walked there instead. (5 mins)
No room service after 10pm which is crazy for an airport hotel. 
No bottle opener in the room and no hot water in the morning. 
Pointed all this out and was only offered an empty apology. ",1,2014,03,18
245,A disappointment,"I have stayed before at the Radisson Blu at Dublin Airport as it is extremely convenient for a early morning flight. I visited last week and found it a little downbeat. I was very disappointed in the room especially as the toilet had a significant problem to flush appropriately. 
On the other hand the early morning complimentary coffee, breakfast bars and fruit, as well as the dependable shuttle to the airport made up for a lot of the disppointment from the room facilities.",3,2014,03,11
245,Event,We want to say big Thank You to the Staff and Management for the professional and quick service during our event. We had life music event with 300 people.  Everything went excellent! Thank you to the chefs we were very good looked after.  Staff were friendly and very helpful. Recommend to everybody who is looking for this kind of event.,5,2014,03,10
245,Can't Beat the Convenience,"If you're traveling light, you can walk to the airport from this hotel - that's how close it is.  It certainly isn't a budget hotel, but it's the perfect choice for travelers with an early flight or those who want to eliminate the possibility of a transportation snafu making them late for their flight.  I don't normally stay at airport hotels because I think they're overpriced, but I'm glad I did and will do so again if I return to Dublin.  As others have noted, the hotel has been renovated within the last year or so, is clean, and has very helpful staff.",4,2014,03,09
245,One night stay,"My wife and I stayed here for one night because we had a very early flight the following morning. We were upgraded to a Business Class room (possibly because we are points holders) which was a large, well equipped room. We especially enjoyed the Nespresso coffee machine with decaf coffee.
We went to the T3 bar and ate from their bar menu. Despite being here on Valentine's evening we were able to get a table where we enjoyed Valentine's cocktails, 2 beers and great burgers accompagnied with chunky chips. The quality of the food was excellent and not too expensive. The shuttle bus was available at 4am to take us to the airport.
Highly recommended!!",5,2014,03,08
245,Superb,"I stayed here for just 7 hours, in between flights. 
I was met at the airport terminal very late at night by a very polite and helpful driver in the hotel minibus, who carried my big suitcases up to my room for me, and at no extra charge. 
The receptionist was welcoming, attentive and helpful. I was expected, and all was ready for me. 
The room was warm, spacious, very clean and very comfortable. The bed was blissful - queen-sized, good pillows, crisp linen. My wake-up call was exactly on time, and there was a further call about 5 minutes later to check that I was up and about. The shower was good, and the towels white, fat and fluffy. A snack breakfast was available (inclusive) - plentiful tea, coffee and hot milk and fresh fruit, with cereal bars to take out if required. The minibus dropped me off back at the terminal in good time for my onward flight. The room had a wonderful view over the airport, but was quiet, and, once the curtains drawn, one would never know that there was a busy airport outside. I slept very well, in spite of my early start the next day.
I wish I could have stayed longer.",5,2014,03,03
245,Excellent airport hotel,"Stayed here for a morning flight out of Dublin to close out our recent vacation. Lovely hotel: recently renovated and very clean. Breakfast was included and offered everything  from full Irish breakfast options to toast and cereal. Minimal noise from the airport.  Age dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was good,  not amazing but a good option since there isn't much else around and we didn't want to drive somewhere.  It's not close the downtown Dublin so don't use this as a starting point to see the city.  There is a fee for parking so try to avoid coming with a car if possible: they have a free 24 hour shuttle to and from the airport. ",5,2014,03,03
245,As you would expect from this brand but rooms are tired,"This hotel is in the grounds of Dublin airport and has a free shuttle service. So although it is more expensive than other local hotels, when you take a taxi fare into consideration, it works out the same or cheaper. I thought the rooms were ok but a little shabby and in need of an uplift. Bathroom clean but reminded me of hospital bathroom! I liked the choice of films they had on pay tv. Restaurant was very busy, food excellent and service good. All in all it fulfilled my expectations and I would stay again.",4,2014,03,01
245,So Clean,"I missed my Flight after my plane arrived to Dublin Airport. Delta Airlines Recommended I call the Radison. I called and spoke to a Very nice lady. I had fallen on Black Ice and was in so much pain. They took me up to my Room carried my Luggage and made sure I was Ok. I don't remember the exact reason but they did have to change my room. The rested and then went down to get some to eat the Area was so clean. I rested in the afternoon and went to the Lounge for drinks and a small bite to eat. 
The Internet however was not free as I read in the add. It was so much for so many minutes in the lobby and so much a day in your room. 
It was a great place to stay. I didn't relize there was a Bus to go down town however. 
I am planning on returning in April so I can catch a flight out the next AM. Make sure you take a look at your Bill before you finalize it. I had extra Charges on mine but there took those off. The staff was great in every area. I was pleased. I am not sure about the Breakfast as I didn't pay extra for that.  Patty from Iowa USA  PS Free Shuttle to Airport and from the Airport is nice.",4,2010,03,01
245,Not 4 stars ...,"Breakfast is overpriced for the offer, bathrooms are very old and small and in need of renovation.",1,2024,07,30
245,Dublin Airport,"Good location in relation to the airport, good value for money.
Good shuttle service every 20 minutes.
Good restaurant and excellent reception staff.
Not having a car I cannot review the parking service.",4,2024,02,05
245,A few minutes from the airport,"Ideal hotel if you want to be close to the hotel, just 10 minutes walk from the airport, they have a shuttle service. Room is modern and clean. Regular breakfast, there could be much more variety. There is room service but the prices are abusive, they charge you €10 extra.",3,2023,09,16
245,Urlaub,"Letzter Tag in Irland,  noch einmal durch Dublin bummeln, Abflug war am nächsten Tag um 7 Uhr. Aufenthalt im raddison war sehr angenehm,  nur zu kurz. Sehr guter Service,  freundliches Personal.  Gerne wieder",5,2023,06,20
245,Perfekte Lage,"Super zu Fuß vom Flughafen erreichbar. Und wer nicht zu Fuß gehen möchte wir ein Shuttel angeboten. Zimmereinrichtung war sehr modern, nur leider war das Bad nicht richtig gereinigt worden, was sehr schade war.",4,2023,05,20

245,"Posizione ottima, bagno rivedibile","Posizione ottima, vicinissimo all'aeroporto raggiungibile anche a piedi, comunque l'hotel mette a disposizione il servizio di navetta gratuito, ne abbiamo usufruito alle 5 del mattino. Camera spaziosa, ampia e moderna, ma poco illuminata. Il bagno è un grande neo, vecchio e non conforme allo stile dell'hotel, vasca rovinata, mancanza di luce vicino allo specchio e cosa più grave, mancanza dello scopettone vicino al wc. ",3,2023,04,10
245,Si può fare di meglio ,L'insonorizzazione delle stanze è molto carente: gli aerei sembravano atterrare dietro la finestra e la tv della stanza vicina era chiaramente udibile. Non il massimo per un airport hotel dove magari bisogna svegliarsi presto (come nel nostro caso). La stanza in sé era confortevole e spaziosa. Abbiamo cenato al ristorante e ci siamo pentiti di non aver usato delivero.,2,2023,03,27

245,Lautes Flughafenhotel,Sehr in die Jahre gekommenes Flughafenhotel. Laut. Wenig hilfsbereites und unfreundliches Personal. Weckdienst funktioniert nicht. Shuttleservice kann nicht reserviert werden. €€ Preis/Leistung grenzwertig. Keine Empfehlung.,2,2023,03,08
245,beste Entscheidung,"Das Hotel ist sehr angenehm und das personal sehr freundlich. Da mein Flug um 6 Uhr morgends ging, war es sehr entspannend gleich neben dem Flughafen zu sein und kein Taxi zu benötigen. Die Fenster waren schalldicht und man hört nicht den Flugverkehr. Ich kann dieses Hotel sehr empfehlen.",5,2023,02,26
245,Marcel,"Insgesamt alles gut. Nur bei Aus checken wurde mir keine Rechnung für konsumieren in Restaurant angezeigt/gegeben. Zimmer (Suite) war veraltet und nicht unbedingt sauber. Für so ein ""Stolse"" Preis und quasi ""Suite) erwarte ich etwas mehr. ",4,2022,10,21
245,Letto comodo vicino all'aeroporto,"Ho soggiornato in questo hotel solo per una notte, e neanche intera dato che sono dovuta andare via alle 5 per prendere un volo. Sulla stanza nulla da dire, pulita, spaziosa, letto molto comodo, sarebbe stato apprezzato trovare il telecomando della tv igienizzato, come ormai fanno in tanti altri hotel di alta gamma. 
In stanza c'era sia il bollitore che la macchinetta del caffè, e due bottigliette d'acqua offerte. 
Il costo però solo per una notte, senza colazione, è davvero troppo alto, si è costretti ad accettare solo per mancanza di alternative altrettanto vicine all'aeroporto.
Alla reception sbrigativi e non particolarmente attenti alle esigenze del cliente, la ragazza parlava velocemente e mangiandosi qualche parola, rendendo difficile per me e il mio compagno capire cosa stesse dicendo. Il top sarebbe, sopratutto per un hotel vicino all'aereoporto e così costoso, personale che parli più lingue, ma almeno più disponibilità e attenzione nel farsi capire sarebbe stata apprezzata.",4,2022,08,26
245,Excelente estadía,"El hotel es hermoso y muy cómodo. La habitación super amplia, el baño muy espacioso también. La atención fue excepcional. A metros del aeropuerto, tiene servicio de transfer gratuito al mismo. Lo super recomiendo si requieres estar cerca del aeropuerto.",5,2022,08,21

Ich habe hier lediglich einen Notaufenthalt wegen Flugausfalls verbracht. Für diesen Zweck war der Zimmerpreis etwas hoch. Ansonsten fußläufig in 5 Minuten zu erreichen.

245,Nützliches Haus für frühen Abflugtermin,"Wir bevorzugen das Radisson Blu Hotel am Dublin Airport, weil wir von hier aus rechtzeitig und ausgeruht unseren frühen Flug vom Flughafen aus erreichen.

245,Schlechtes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis,"Sehr unfreundliche Rezeption mit mangelhafter Hilfsbereitschaft. Weil ein Adapter in der 400 € teuren Junior Suite fehlt, wird der Gast von einer ungepflegten Dame mit Pickeln im Gesicht aufgefordert, zu Fuß zum sehr weit entfernten Flughafen zu gehen. Er soll sich dort durchfragen, ob es ein Geschäft gibt, das Adapter verkauft. Als ich mich weigerte, hat mir nach langem Warten die F&B-Managerin ihr privates Adapter geliehen. Kein Zimmer mit Badewanne verfügbar. Leere Minibar. Nicht mal eine Flasche Wasser auf dem Zimmer. Gutes Restaurant im Haus. Sehr gutes Frühstück.",2,2022,06,16

Hier wurde länger nicht gewischt. Also keine Reinigung bzw. Aufbereitung des Zimmers und das zu Corona. Bad: einmal Shampoo und Duschgel (30 ml) für zwei Personen geht auch nicht.  Bettwäsche hatte Löcher. Im Badezimmer alter billiger Duschvorhang der nicht bis nach hinten abgeschlossen hat. Mannkonnte die Dusche nur minimal aufdrehen oder das Bad unter Wasser setzen. Vorhänge haben oben nicht abgeschlossen, so dass der Lichtstrahler draußen der auf unser Zimmer gerichtet war, die Nacht das Zimmer erhellte.

245,Empfelenswert,"Wir waren für 1 Nacht hier, wegen der Nähe zum Flughafe.
Das Personal war sehr freundlich und das Hotel sehr sauber.

245,Experiencia genial para la noche de antes del vuelo.,"Las habitaciones premium son una pasada, cama grande, salón grande, baño grande, un buen lujo para el último día del viaje y buen descanso antes de volar, el check-out es bastante tarde y eso se agradece para los vuelos de mediodía. 
A pocos pasos del aeropuerto y también tienen un Shuttle Bus que te lleva con las maletas hasta las terminales.
Lo único a mejorar sería el proceso de Check-in que se demoran mucho tiempo para procesar los datos de la reserva.
Pero como he dicho anteriormente es un lujo de habitación y la recomendaría al 100%. Nos gustó mucho.

Letto davvero comodo… uno dei migliori 
colazione abbondante internazionale.
Molto silenzio con navetta a disposizione dei clienti per il trasporto delle valigie …

Pulizia al massimo durante il Covid-19…",4,2021,07,25
245,Schönes Hotel in Airport Nähe .....,... mit sehr nettem und qualifizierten Personal. Leider Corona bedingt das Zimmer nicht so sauber vorgefunden und beim Frühstück wurde nicht auf die Maskenpflicht geachtet. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis in Ordnung.,3,2021,01,12
245,DAVVERO COMPLIMENTI,"Albergo da brividi.
Lavandino dove l'acqua non va giù.
Lampadine rotte.
Base del letto rotta.
Frigobar vuoto e sporco.
Carta igienica lasciata dal precedente ospite, non messa nuova.
Polvere dappertutto.
Presa solo inglese.
Preciso di avere prenotato e soggiornato in una camera superior.
Ho chiuso la luce sperando che arrivasse presto l'indomani così da poter scappare via.
In Italia li avrebbero denunciati.",1,2020,08,22
245,Buena opcion,El hotel cumplió y superó mis expectativas. Me gusto sobre todo la comodidad de la cama. El personal fue muy amable y el desayuno estaba muy bien. Además habían tomado medidas contra el covid19. Recomendable,5,2020,07,24
245,Todo correcto,"Muy amables.me deje un reloj y me dieron muchas facilidades para devolvermelo.
Personal muy atento
Desayuno muy bueno y tenian opcion sin gluten.
Transfer gratuito al aeropuerto, aunque esta muy muy cerca",4,2020,01,25
245,"Hotel vicinissimo all'aeroporto, con servizio navetta gratuito","Ho soggiornato in questo hotel durante un viaggio di lavoro, volendo dormire nelle vicinanze dell'aeroporto data la partenza del mio volo all'alba. L'hotel è tutto sommato un buon compromesso tra qualità, servizi offerti e prezzo. La navetta gratuita per l'aeroporto parte ogni 15min, è disponibile h24 e impiega 5min per arrivare ai Terminal.",4,2020,01,17
245,"Excelentes habitaciones, buen desayuno y profesionalidad del staff","Excelentes habitaciones, baño moderno y funcional, cómodas camas y buenas almohadas. Muy buen desayuno con productos para todos los gustos. Staff profesional y proactivo. Detalles como fruta y café en la habitación",5,2020,01,06
245,Habitaciones muy cómodas y bien decoradas,"Dormí solo una noche pero la experiencia fue muy buena. La habitación limpia, muy confortable y decorada con mucho gusto. El baño muy nuevo y con una presión de agua perfecta. El desayuno fantástico y muy variado. ",5,2019,11,21
245,Soggiorno soddisfacente,"L'hotel si trova in un'ottima posizione per entrambi i terminal di Dublino. Avrei preferito essere coccolata maggiormente dal.moembtobche spesso sono ospite qui. Migliorerei la disposizione delle prese elettriche nelle camere, in modo tale da poter caricare cellulari e laptop da più punti",4,2019,10,12
245,Ottimo hotel per una sosta vicino all'aeroporto,"Leggendo le recensioni precedenti mi viene da pensare che ci siano stanze ristrutturate ed altre no. Ho soggiornato una notte facendo scalo in attesa di un volo che dovevo prendere la mattina successiva e la camera che mi hanno assegnato era enorme, arredata perfettamente con tv schermo piatto 55 pollici, pulitissima, con wi-fi gratuito veloce, macchinetta del caffè, bollitore e aria condizionata perfettamente funzionante. Il bagno moderno con una doccia enorme e con ottimo kit di cortesia. Il personale della reception è stato gentilissimo. Servizio navetta ogni 20 minuti (ma a richiesta è arrivata subito) gratuito. La distanza dai terminal consentirebbe comunque di raggiungerli anche a piedi in pochi minuti. È possibile mangiare in hotel ma non ho usufruito del servizio.  L’unico lato negativo è il prezzo. Ho pagato 160 Euro per una notte che per un hotel nei pressi dell’aeroporto a mio parere è esagerato. Per quanto è un prezzo coerente con il livello dei prezzi esagerato raggiunto dagli hotel – e più in generale da tutte le categorie di alloggio - di Dublino che negli ultimi hanno subito aumenti assurdi. Se avessi necessità di soggiornare nei pressi dell’aeroporto senz’altro lo utilizzerei di nuovo. Se si ha anche il tempo di trascorrere qualche ora a Dublino si può prendere dall’aeroporto il bus della Aircoach che costa 12 Euro (andata e ritorno) o 7 euro corsa singola e passa ogni mezz’ora.",4,2019,09,13
245,Genial hotel cerca del aeropuerto.,"Llegamos antes de la hora de check in habitual y no hubo ningún problema, la habitación y el baño amplios, detalles gratuitos de agua y fruta, cama muy grande y cómoda. El servicio de transporte al aeropuerto cada 15 minutos muy cómodo. ",5,2019,08,30
245,direkt am Flughafren Dublin,"Die Zimmer sind ok, sonst etwas in die Jahre gekommenes Hotel direkt am Flughafen mit Shuttleservice zu den Terminals. Personal sehr freundlich. Für eine Nacht ok, wenn auch Preis-Leistung nicht ganz ok ist. ",3,2019,08,29
245,Non all’altezza della catena ,"Peccato.... una delusione. Ho soggiornato in questo hotel una sola notte perché, al ritorno da un mio viaggio, dovevo prendere un aereo il giorno dopo alle sette. Sono rimasta delusa dalla stanza, dal bagno datato, dall’arredamento. Uniche note positive la navetta che ad ogni ora ti porta all’aeroporto e il caffè o il tea che viene preparato dall’alba per i viaggiatori. Staff eccellente ma l’albergo avrebbe bisogno di una bella ristrutturazione. Anche perché i Radisson Blu sono in genere meravigliosi. Ho ancora il ricordo di quello di Chicago che era veramente super!!!!! ",2,2019,08,26
245,Un po delusa,Struttura mrolto bella molto curata  personale decisamente e competente. . Questa mattina partenza dell'aereo alle ore 7  e la colazione era composta da barrette energetiche e da frutta fresca questa per me non è una colorazione-è stata molto molto deludente Purtroppo è stata la prima volta che facevo un'esperienza nei vostri  hotel e visto lo spiacevole inconveniente non so se ne farò altre    ,4,2019,08,25
245,"Schlechter Service mit dem Shuttelbus, alles andere gut.","Zimmer und Frühstück waren sehr gut, alle drei Räume im gleichen Stockwerk. Bad (mit Pflegeprodukten) gut und sauber. Klimatisierte Zimmer, schallgeschützt, vom Flughafen kaum etwas zu hören. Zu den Autovermietungen kann man leicht zu Fuß gelangen.  ",3,2019,08,25
245,Ok,"Ottimo hotel per partenza da aeroporto. Ottimi servizi e cordialità. Pulizia e cura delle stanze. Ma.... per favore, basta piumini obbligatori sul letto ! Se uno vuole se lo aggiunge. Ristorante adeguato e navetta x terminal eccellente. Grazie!",4,2019,08,19
245,Hotel comodo per aeroporto,Pernottamento in aeroporto dopo volo in tarda serata necessario al ritiro dell'automobile la mattina successiva. Comodo e raggiungibile a piedi in 5 minuti dal terminal. Personale gentile ma purtroppo colazione non inclusa,4,2019,08,07
245,Hotel cómodo si necesitas alojarte cerca del aeropuerto,"Hotel comodo, sin lujos pero functional, con una habitacion amplia, limpio y un buen desayuno. A 5 minutos del aeropuerto en el mini-bus gratuito del hotel. 
Es silencioso por la noche. Lo malo es que esta en una zona sin interés y donde no apetece dar un paseo, pero cumple su funcion.",4,2019,08,05
245,Investitionsstau in den Zimmern,"Die Qualität der Zimmer entsprechen bei Weitem nicht denen die vergleichbare Hotels heute bieten. Das gilt vor Allem für die Möbel und die Badezimmer. Der Gesamteindruck des Hotels war im Eingangsbereich, den Bars und dem Restaurant gut und wurde je näher man dem Zimmer kam schlechter. Aus unserer Sicht kein gutes Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis.",2,2019,07,19
245,Vom Namen geblendet - ein Reinfall!!,"Der Name Radisson Blu stand für uns immer für Qualität, Komfort und gehobene Ansprüche. Was uns allerdings am Dublin Airport erwartete war das komplette Gegenteil! 
Empfangshalle: laut, überfüllt, unorganisiert und erinnerte eher an eine Bahnhofshalle
In den Fluren zu den Zimmern: verschmutzter Teppichboden, beschädigte Wände und Fußleisten, zerschrammte Türen und defekte Türscharniere 
Im Zimmer: dort fanden wir einen alten, benutzten Teebeutel im Wasserkocher 
Das Badezimmer: grün versparkte Abflüsse in Waschbecken und Badewanne, Schimmel an den Wänden am Waschbecken, Rost an den Einfassungen der Badewanne, schwarze Fugen, beschädigte Silikonfugen sowie Staub/Schmutz in den Ecken
Von einem Hotel in dieser Nähe zum Flughafen hätten wir eine deutlich bessere Geräuschdämmung erwarte. 
Wir sind entsetzt und enttäuscht von unserem Aufenthalt. 
Der Preis von 173,- € pro Nacht und Zimmer steht in absolut keinem Verhältnis zu der Qualität und der Leistung. Das macht auch der kostenlose 24 Stunden Shuttleservice und die Flughafennähe nicht weg. Für die Mehrkosten des Zimmers hätten wir auch bequem von jedem anderen Hotel im Umkreis mehrfach mit dem Taxi zum Airport fahren können. ",1,2019,07,19
245,Modernes Hotel,"Alles war in Ordnung: Zimmer top und ruhig, Shuttle zum Flughafen funktionierte reibungslos, es gibt sogar einen Obst und Kaffee/Tee zum Mitnehmen, wenn man vor der eigentlichen Frühstückszeit abreisen muss.",5,2019,06,22
245,"Super Flughafenhotel, direkter Hotelshuttel zum Terminal","Zimmer groß, modern, sauber mit Nespressomaschine. Frühstück Continental, große Auswahl, alles was das Herz begehrt. Restaurant mit freundlicher Bedienung und hervorragendem Essen. Jederzeit gerne wieder.",5,2019,06,17
245,Notunterkunft,"Da ich meine Ferien aus gesundheitlichen Gründen  abbrechen musste, musste ich eine Nacht (15.6/16.6)  in einem Hotel übernachten bevor mein Flug ging. 
Für den Preis stimmt für mich das Preis / Leistungsverhältnis für ein internationales 4* Hotel nicht. 
Der Empfang war ok. 
Das Zimmer auch. 
Die Sanitäranlagen lassen ebenso zu Wünschen übrig (Rostige Armaturen, Badewannnenumrandung defekt, WC spühlt nicht richtig) wie der Room Service. 
Über die angepriesene App bestellte ich ein Abendessen aufs Zimmer. Reaktionszeit 30min. In 20min sei die Bestellung da. Nach 45min (nach der Nachricht des Hotel, also Total nach 75min kam mein essen. Pommes kalt, Burger lauwarm, Eis geschmolzen. Besteck war dabei. Nur ein Löffel für das Dessert (Eis) wäre praktisch gewesen.",2,2019,06,15
245,Von Radisson Anderes gewohnt  -  Enttäuschung,"Dieses Hotel eignet sich für 1 Nacht als Zwangsaufenthalt beim Abflug tags darauf. Gegen die Größe der Zimmer und die Sauberkeit bestehen keine Einwendungen. Nach einer längeren Irland-Rundreise ist man schon für eine neuzeitliche Mischbatterie und eine moderne Dusche im Badezimmer dankbar. 
Das Frühstück ist mit € 17,00 hoffnungslos überteuert. Genauso happig sind die Preise auf der Speisekarte. Wir hatten Filet-Steak und Sirloin Steak mit Süßkartoffel-Chips. Gegen Qualität und Zubereitung kann man nicht meckern  -  aber halt die Preise.
Nachdem auch hier die Geschäftsleitung wieder kommentieren wird, eine Frage:
Warum muss hier Kentucky Bier aus Flaschen ausgeschenkt werden, wieso wird kein vernünftiges Fassbier angeboten?

Was uns noch aufgeregt hat:
Das Angebot an Fernseh-Kanälen ist unter aller Kanone. In einem Hotel einer international agierenden Hotelgruppe an einem Internationalen Flughafen in einer europäischen Hauptstadt darf man doch wohl Fernsehkanäle des Deutschen Fernsehens und anderer Länder erwarten. Bei Radisson Blu Hotel in Dublin offensichtlich nicht. Das ist schon Mega schwach!

Die Mitarbeiter an der Reception sind von einer kühlen Minimal-Freundlichkeit. Von herzlich Willkommen kann überhaupt keine Rede sein. Ein eigenartiges Gehabe, bei dem sich der Gast frägt, ob man sich das in diesem Hause so leisten kann.

Wähle das nächste Mal ein Hotel in der Nachbarschaft!",3,2019,05,22
245,"Pessimo Hotel, 4 stelle rubate",Prenotato per la vicinanza all’aeroporto. Non ho mai dormito così male in un hotel: letto e cuscini scomodissimi oltre ad una camera rumorosissima. Colazione del mattino cheap e senza personalità .... anche solo per il caffè e il latte ci sono i distributori automatici. Personale al ricevimento scontroso e poco sorridente. Pessima esperienza. NON PENSATE DI ANDARE IN UN 4 STELLE,1,2019,05,05
245,Pessima esperienza,"Ho scelto l'hotel per la posizione vicino all'aeroporto.  La camera era spaziosa e piuttosto pulita, ma il letto era piccolo e sfondato nel centro. La tenda era rotta come pure la pattumiera nel bagno. Non ci ritorneremo. ",1,2019,04,22
245,Ottima posizione e rapporto qualità prezzo,"L’hotel è confortevole. Pulito, personale cordiale, colazione abbondante. Sono arrivata a mezzanotte all’aeroporto e volevo una struttura vicina per il pernottamento di una notte. Struttura facile da raggiungere a piedi. La consiglio per posizione e rapporto qualità/prezzo",5,2019,04,21
245,"Bien para acer escala en el aeropuerto, con algun fallo importante","Nos alojamos en este hotel por dos noches, ya que nuestro vuelo salía el domingo a las seis de la mañana. (si tienes tiempo de llegar al aeropuerto tranquilamente para coger tu vuelo y quieres ver bien Dublín no te recomiendo este hotel). El hotel esta situado al lado de la terminal del aeropuerto (puedes ir andando hasta la T2 y tardaras unos 15 min, o bien ir en una furgoneta del hotel que pasa cada 15 min y tarda dos minutos en llegar a la T1) y a unos 10 km del centro de Dublín. La mejor manera de ir al centro es yendo a la Terminal y desde allí coger uno de los buses que te llevan al centro (en total tardaras unos 45 minutos).
Nuestra habitacion era amplia con un sofa, una cama de matrimonio y un baño amplio.
Cabe destacar quee viajamos con nuestro hijo de 5 meses y cuando llegamos la habitación estaba helada, y la calefación a 24 grados solo expulsaba aire frio, tras decirlo un par de veces en recepción y despues de subirnos una estufa, la chica que nos la subio nos dijo que para que el aire saliera caliente habia que poner la calefación a 28 grados como minimo. (y asi fue, una vez puesta a esa temperatura comenzo a salir aire caliente). El fallo para mi mas grande y que deberian corregir es que nosotros pedimos cuna, la cual ya teniamo en la habitación una vez llegamos allí, pero tenía un colchon tan fino que con solo poner la mano sobre el colchón se notaban perfectamente los hierros de la estructura de la cuna (era una cuna tipica de viaje) por lo que ningún niño puede dormir ahí. (El niño durmio con nosotros en la cama.
El hotel tiene un restaurante (algo caro) y un bar en el que tambien sirven comida, como pizza, sandwiches, etc... (esta bastante bien y es mas barato).
En resumen no volveria a este hotel, para visitar Dublín merece la pena gastarse un poco mas en uno dentro de la ciudad.",3,2019,04,09
245,Bene solo per la posizione,"La posizione in prossimità dell' aeroporto e la navetta ogni 15 minuti lo rendono comodo ma per il resto non lo consiglierei per quanto costa. le camere anche se pulite, non sono assolutamente funzionali. Una sola presa di corrente per fare un esempio. Il bagno piccolo e scomodo. Scrivania e armadi che cadono a pezzi. Necessita un restauro! Bene invece il ristorante.",3,2019,02,20
245,Trabajo,"La habitación una porquería , ni habia sillas, la cama era una de esas camas empotradas que se bajan , muy incomoda y encima dicen que por la noche hay un corte de corriente por mantenimiento y que no podemos dejar nada conectado. De lo cual no me informaron en absoluto de ello cuando hice la reserva.
Si puedo evitarlo no volveré.",1,2019,02,12
245,Comodo e basta,"Per il prezzo che ha non offre camere adeguate. Hotel datato, il bagno era inguardabile. Incrostazioni sui rubinetti, tendone della camera tutto macchiato che purtroppo ho dovuto toccare x chiuderlo. Insomma, vince solo la comodità per l'aeroporto servito dalla navetta gratuita che passa ogni 15 min tutto il giorno.",2,2019,01,28
245,Normaler Aufenthalt,Eine Übernachtung in Dublin am Flughafen. War rundum zufrieden. Zimmer konnte sauberer sein. USB charger bzw adapter für EU Steckdosen sollte es auf den Zimmern geben. Frühstücksbuffet ist mit 17€ pro Person zu teuer. ,3,2019,01,14
245,"Sehr gutes Hotel, sehr nahe am Flughafen","Bereits der Check-in war sehr freundlich, das Personal sehr hilfsbereit. 

Das Zimmer war sauber und ordentlich und für eine Person wirklich groß (hatte ein Doppelzimmer zur Einzelnutzung). Die Fenster sind sehr gut, denn man hört keinen Fluglärm. 

Das Hotel kann durch den Hotel-eigenen Shuttle-Service erreicht werden, alternativ kann auch zum Flughafen gelaufen werden (ca. 15 Minuten, gemütlich). 

Das Essen war wirklich gut, das Frühstück sehr liebevoll angerichtet mit netten Botschaften am Buffet. 
Für einen Zwischenstopp würde ich hier wieder übernachten. 
Das Hotel ist aber denke ich nicht geeignet, um eine längere Zeit/ Urlaub hier zu verbringen ;).",4,2018,10,19
245,Gutes Hotel,"Das Hotel liegt nur wenige Gehminuten vom Dublin Airport entfernt.

Der Empfangsbereich ist groß und offen gestaltet. Das Restaurant bietet diverse Speisen. Die Zimmer sind recht groß und gut ausgestattet. Mein Zimmer verfügte über einen Kühlschrank mit zwei kostenlosen Flaschen Wasser, eine Kaffeemaschine und einem Wasserkocher. Ein extra Sitzbereich mit zwei Stühle und einem Tisch, sowie einen separaten Schreibtisch.

Mir persönlich fehlten normale Vorhänge und nicht nur die dunklen ""Überzüge"".

Das Essen im Restaurant war sehr gut und stand im einem guten Preis/Leistungsverhältnis.

Das Personal war in allen Bereichen freundlich und zuvorkommenden.

Alles in allem, ein angenehmer Aufenthalt.",4,2018,09,18

245,Ottima Base,"Per soggiorni al ""volo"" questo hotel è una vera e propria base di partenza, o di arrivo.
Senza badare alle particolarità o meno presenti che possono inficiare un giudizio di un hotel, dico subito che ci siamo fermati per una sola notte.
Nonostante il brevissimo soggiorno, posso garantire di aver dormito splendidamente riscontrando un'ottima qualità del sonno grazie a materassi cui qualità ed una buona insonorizzazione. La colazione rispecchia gli standard Radisson, nonché l'assoluta gentilezza dello staff.
Grazie dunque and Get going!",3,2018,07,29
245,Bellissimo albergo,"Personale gentile. La camera che mi hanno assegnato era bellissima, molto pulita e attrezzata di tutto. Il bagno nuovissimo con una doccia molto grande.

Lo consiglio!",5,2018,05,24
245,Cosa volere di più,"Leggendo le recensioni mi viene da pensare che le persone sono davvero incontentabili.
L hotel è bello, pulito elegante, stanze ampie e ben organizzate, bagni grandi puliti e funzionali.
Ottima la cena, ancora meglio la colazione. posizione vicinissima all'aeroporto e vicino ai mezzi per raggiungere il centro.
Una stella in meno solo per i prezzi non proprio economici, ma ripagati comunque dalla qualità offerta.
",4,2018,05,10
245,funzionalità,lo risceglierei solo per questo. accanto all'aeroporto. (due minuti in shuttle). direi che si intravede un intervento di modernizzazione ma la struttura è un po' incombente. non molto bella da fuori. l'interno è standard per un hotel di passaggio viaggiatori. il ristorante era troppo freddo con ventole ovunque e tavoli impersonali. il menu offerto molto a cliché (zuppetta - bistecca etc.) camere funzionali con letti standard e bagno moderno con doccia molto spaziosa. presenza di servzio per tea/caffe' e asse da stiro per noi che viaggiamo in tailleur siegazzato dalle piogge irlandesi può essere utile. ci tornerei se mi servisse si. è cmq meglio di quello che ha davanti di cui nn ricordo il nome sempre giallo in esterno ma con standard inferiori all'interno. mi sembra iniziasse con la M.,3,2018,05,04
245,Ausgezeichnete Wahl,"Das Hotel ist in Laufnähe zum Flughafen. Die Zimmer sind sehr groß und gut ausgestattet. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend.

245,Insomma...,"Hotel datato e rammodernato non benissimo, di fronte il T2 è comodo per la vicinanza all’hub e niente altro.
Camere pulite ma datate, personale cortese ma senza sforzi.
Ristorante: buona varietà e altrettanta qualità, servizio lento e svogliato con la fretta di prendere l’ordinazione, gentile come dovuto e poco sorridente. Non ho provato la colazione. 
Hotel adatto solo ad un passaggio veloce.",3,2017,12,02

245,"Super Hotel, wenn man am nächsten Tag fliegen muss","Wir (Kollege und ich) waren für eine Nacht im Radisson Blu Dublin Airport Hotel.
Nach einem vollgestopften Roadtrip waren wir froh, dass wir die letzte Nacht in Dublin in einem bequemen Bett schlafen konnte, bevor es dann am nächsten Tag wieder an den Flughafen ging.
Das Hotel bietet kostenlos alle 15 Minuten einen Airport-Shuttle vom und an den Dublin Airport an.
Die Zimmer haben genug Platz und sind sehr ruhig. Das Bad ist ebenfalls gut ausgebaut.

Für Reisende, die am nächsten Tag fliegen müssen, kann ich dieses Hotel nur empfehlen, auch wenn es im Verhältnis eher teuer ist.",4,2017,09,10
245,Pratico ma datato,"I punti forti dell'hotel sono sicuramente la posizione se avere voli in partenza la mattina presto, il servizio navetta presso i terminal, la colazione di ottimo livello come negli standard della catena, ecco sotto gli standard della catena sono invece le camere  che ho trovato vecchiotte e non pulitissime.
Ultima nota è presente il ristorante comodo per non spostarsi dalla struttura",3,2017,08,16
245,"Bello, comodo e pratico.","Per la fine della bella visita in Irlanda e avendo l'aereo al mattino presto ho scelto di pernottare il più vicino possibile e così ho provato anche questo albergo vicino l'aeroporto. La posizione è ottima, si arriva in poco tempo anche a piedi (bisogna solo fare attenzione agli attraversamenti giusti altrimenti diventa difficile), ma in ogni caso c'è la navetta gratuita. Inoltre l'aeroporto è ben collegato al centro città (anche se non vicinissimo) con vari bus, per cui visto il prezzo interessante l'ho usato anche per gli ultimi giorni a Dublino. Il personale e cortese e professionale. Presenti bar e ristorante per mangiare qualcosa (anche i prezzi sono un pò altini e i piatti un pochino particolari).
Da fuori l'edificio è abbastanza anonimo e comune, ma dentro mi è piaciuto molto: è vero che forse servirebbe una rinfrescata, ma l'eleganza e lo stile dei Radisson si vede perfettamente. Camera grande, letti ampi e comodi e con piacere c'erano anche gli accapatoi. Come dicevo lo spazio è molto ed è presente anche un divano. Non amo partilarmente la moquette, ma la camera era molto bella e soprattutto l'ho trovata pulita e curata. Ottimo anche il bagno per stile e dimensione. Il panorama dalla finestra era bello se si guardava in alto e si vedevano gli aerei atterrare, un pò meno guardando il basso (dava tipo sulla parte scarico) ma tutto accettabile. L'insonorizzazione era perfetta: stando così vicino all'aeroporto temevo il rumore, invece no, ho dormito perfettamente.
L'appunto invece lo farei sulla bilancia per pesare il bagaglio (troppo caro) e la postazione al computer (che è a pagamento mentre per me a questo livello di alberghi dovrebbe essere sempre gratuito come sono abituato a vedere, ma è un qualcosa in più che viene offerto); e poi di notte al corridoio del piano ho sentito parecchi movimenti (un pò fastidiosi) e la mattina dopo ho visto tanti cartoni della pizza fuori da varie porte (non avevo idea si potesse ordinare cibo da asporto in albergo) ma vabbè, questo riguarda gli altri ospiti.
Riassumendo, adoro gli alberghi di grandi catene perchè mi aspetto un certo standard e questo Radisson dell'aeroporto è stato perfetto per qualità dello staff, posizione e camera. Di sicuro lo terrò ancora presente nei prossimi viaggi irlandesi.",4,2017,08,13
245,Praktisch für späte Ankunft oder frühe Abreise,"Da das Hotel nahe am Flughafen liegt (in ca. 10 Minuten Fussmarsch oder mit Shuttlebus erreichbar), ist es praktisch für späte Anreisen oder frühe Abreisen. Das Zimmer war zweckmässig, wenn auch etwas abgewohnt. Gefreut hat uns das reichhaltige Frühstück.",4,2017,07,28
245,Ottimo soprattutto per chi deve viaggiare,"L'hotel è accogliente e offre tanti servizi utili per chi deve partire, tra cui tabellone con le partenze e gli arrivi esattamente come se fossi all'interno dell'aeroporto, bilancia per pesare il bagaglio, possibilità di fare il check-in alla reception. Le camere sono abbastanza spaziose e silenziose. Personale gentile e professionale. Il ristorante ha un'ottima cucina.",4,2017,06,19
245,Super Lage als Unterkunft vor dem Abflug,"Um am nächsten Morgen den Flughafen zeitnah zu erreichen, haben wir erneut das Radisson Blue am Dublin Airport ausgewählt.
Der Empfang ist sehr freundlich und auch auf dem Zimmer fehlt es einem an Nichts.
Die Zimmer sind sehr großzügig gestaltet und das Bad ist sehr sauber.

Abends haben wir im Hoteleigenen Restaurant noch etwas gegessen und wir wurden nicht enttäuscht.
Diverse Speisen von mir und meinen Kollegen wurden frisch serviert und haben auch sehr lecker geschmeckt.
Der Service war auch hier sehr gut und vor Allem freundlich.

Positiv zu erwähnen ist die kleine ""Snackbar"" früh um vier bei der Abreise in der Rezeption.
Hier kann man sich zum Beispiel einen Apfel oder einen Kaffee umsonst mit auf den Weg zum Flughafen nehmen.

Anche se l'hotel in generale si presenta molto bene le camere sono vecchie, la pulizia poi non è il loro forte da queste parti, il bagno fa veramente pietà credo che le foto che ho allegato parlino da sole. 
Unica cosa positiva è la vicinanza all'aeroporto, offrono servizio shuttle gratuito. ",3,2016,12,31
245,Gerne wieder Radisson blu,"Das Radisson blu Dublin Airport Hotel liegt in unmittelbarer Nähe des Flughafens. Ist also ideal, um die Nacht vor dem Flug dort zu verbringen. Wir haben nach unserem Kurzurlaub im County Donegal für zwei Nächte gebucht, einmal um noch Dublin zu erkunden, und, um eben am Abflugtag keine stressige und zeitraubende Anfahrt zum Flughafen zu haben. Hierfür konnten wir den kostenlosen Shuttelbus-Service des Hotels nutzen. Zu Fuß sind es aber auch nur 10 Minuten zum Terminal. Die Fahrt in die ca. 10 km entfernte Innenstadt selbst ist überhaupt kein Problem mit den öffentlichen Bussen. Das Radisson Hotel war für uns eine ideale Unterkunft, vor allem wegen der Lage, aber auch durchaus wegen den Standards, die man von einem Radisson Hotel erwartet. Diese wurden für uns in jeder Weise erfüllt. Die Mitarbeiter am Check-In Counter waren sehr kompetent und freundlich, in der Lobby stehen Karaffen mit Zitronen- und Minzwasser für die Gäste bereit. Die Atmospähre im Empfangs- und angrenzenden Loungebereich empfanden wir sehr angenehm. Unser Standardzimmer war sehr geräumig, gemütlich und sehr sauber. Wir fanden den Blick aus dem 5. Stock auf das quirlige Flughafengeschehen faszinierend. Die Fenster sind gut isoliert. Das Essen im Restaurant T3 hat uns sehr gut geschmeckt, der Service war tadellos. Das Frühstücksangebot ist vielfältig und der Kaffee von guter Qualität. Wir können das Radisson blu Hotel Dublin Airport uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen und würden es bei einem nächsten Aufenthalt wieder buchen.",5,2016,11,30
245,Eine ruhige Nacht vor dem Flug,"Die Lage zum Flughafen ist ideal, wenn man wie wir um 6.50 abfliegen muss. Das Hotel bietet rund um die Uhr einen Shuttle-Service an, der uns in wenigen Minuten zum Terminal brachte.
Da man so weit draußen auf Bar iund Restaurant angewiesen ist, waren wir ganz froh, dass beides von ordentlicher Qualität war und die Preise angemessen waren.
Der Preis für die Übernachtung folgt aus der Lage.",4,2016,10,02
245,Ideale per chi viaggia,"Un buon albergo vicino all'aeroporto di Dublino. Nonostante questa vicinanza, non di sentono rumori esterni. Camere pulite e spaziose. Forse qualche piccolo dettaglio andrebbe migliorato ma in generale direi un buon albergo.",4,2016,09,30
245,Hotel muy práctico y funcional cercano al aeropuerto,"He estado en este hotel dos noches, al llegar al aeropuerto de Dublín y antes de emprender el viaje de regreso a España, días después. Me ha resultado muy práctico y cómodo. Me alojé en la Junior Suite junto con mi familia, con capacidad para cinco personas. Muy espaciosa y confortable. Bien equipada y superluminosa.
Wifi de altas prestaciones en todo el hotel, sin procedimiento de registro complicado.
El restaurante tiene una fórmula, en la que solo pagan los adultos, a la que sacamos gran partido. Además, la comida estaba muy rica.
Los traslados desde y hasta el aeropuerto están muy bien organizados.
A pesar de estar junto al aeropuerto, en la habitación no se oía nada el ruido de los aviones.
La atención del personal ha sido estupenda, sobre todo la de Carmen, compatriota que trabaja en recepción y que se desvivió por ayudarnos; lo cual hizo con gran eficacia y simpatía.
También tenemos muy buen recuerdo de las atenciones dispensadas por Vincent, Gary, Kevish, Pedro, Pat Quinn y Rosaleen.",5,2016,08,16
245,Preis ist der Lage geschuldet,"Unsere Absicht war es nach einem späten Flug eine angenehme Übernachtungsmögchkeit direkt am Flughafen zu haben. Allerdings haben wir mit dem Namen radisson blu auch einen gewissen Mindeststandard/ Komfort verbunden. Positiv: Die Rezeption ist schnell und absolut kompetent. In der Lobby gibt es Wasser mit Zitrone & Minze im Glaswasserspender. Das Zimmer war groß und hatte sogar einen Esstisch mit 4 Stühlen. Seltsam: Das Bett (1,4x2,0m) hatte an Kopfende einen Bettkasten mit schräger Holz-Abdeckung. Negativ: Im Bad lagen überall (Waschbecken/ Toilette/ Spühlkasten) schwarze Krümmel (Erde?) herum. Es gab keinen Schminkspiegel im Bad. Fazit: Wir haben für 1 Nacht 176€ für das Zimmer ohne Frühstück bezahlt und finden das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis eher mittelmäßig gut, d. h. mehr der Lage (man hat nur 5 Min Fussweg von Terminal 2) als dem Hotel geschuldet. ",3,2016,08,14
245,Hotel funcional cerca del aeropuerto ,"Hotel correcto muy cerca del aeropuerto, aunque es necesario transporte adicional como taxi. Las instalaciones son simples con toque moderno, limpieza correcta así como los detalles del hotel y de la habitación. Desayuno abundante aunque escueto en variedad.",3,2016,08,13
245,posizione x chi ha aerei il giorno dopo di prima mattina,"Buon albergo a 10 minuti aereoporto di Dublino. É offerto dallo stesso hotel un servizio da e per aereoporto ogni 15 minuti x 24 ore.
Stanze grandi e pulite discreta ricezione wi-fi , ricca colazione.
Bar non fornitissimo dopo le 23:00",4,2016,07,07
245,Ideale per i viaggiatori che arrivano con voli notturni,L'albergo si trova a 5 minuti a piedi dal terminal dell'aereoporto di Dublino ed è quindi molto comodo per coloro che arrivano di notte o hanno l'aereo la mattina presto...camere spaziose e pulite...personale gentile.,5,2016,06,23
245,... eines Radisson Blu nicht angemessen,"Erfahrungsgemäß dachte ich, man könne mit einem Radisson nicht allzuviel falsch machen. Das Hotel am Dubliner Flughafen bildet allerdings eine Ausnahme: In die Jahre gekommene Bäder sind eben kein schöner Anblick, duschen war nur mit Überflutung des ganzen Badezimmers möglich, da es weder eine funktionale Halterung für die Brause noch einen vernünftigen Schutz an der Wanne gab. In der leeren (!) Minibar wurde man per Schild auf den Roomservice, d.h. korrekter auf eine Service App verwiesen. Bestellen musste man dann trotzdem über das Telefon... Die Servicepauschale von 5€ pro Bestellung findet man ordnungsgemäß ausgezeichnet im Menüheft auf dem Schreibtisch. Der Sinn des erwähnten Schildes und vor allem dessen Kühlung ist für mich nicht ganz eindeutig... 
vielleicht waren einfach viele Minibars übrig? ;-) 
Die angeforderte und zugesagte IT-Unterstützung (nicht jeder firmengesicherte Rechner ist WLAN kompatibel) ließ sich nie blicken, dafür kam am nächsten Morgen ein Aircon Techniker, der sich auch von einem ""please do not disturb""-Schild weder einschüchtern oder gar aufhalten ließ. 
Da sich im Hotel kein eigener Fitneßraum befindet, sondern man einen (per Shuttle erreichbaren) Bereich in einem anderen Hotel nutzen soll, fiel Sport für mich dann einfach mal aus. Zum Ausgleich bekam ich allerdings jeden Tag neue Handtücher in wechselnder Anzahl, die am Ende der Woche dann einen sauberen Stapel von noch sechs unbenutzten Handtüchern auf einem der Stühle ergaben. Ein weiterer Trost ist das wirklich anständige Frühstück. Auch hinsichtlich der Sauberkeit lässt sich nichts bemängeln, da war alles absolut in Ordnung. Wer sich selbst überzeugen möchte, kann dies für rund 200€ pro Nacht (Mai ist natürlich eine beliebte Reisezeit für Dublin) im Businesszimmer ja tun... viel Spaß!",3,2016,05,28
245,Absolut empfehlenswert in der Airport-Nähe,"Top Lage zum Flughafen und gratis shuttle alle 15 Minuten rund um die Uhr.
Zimmer sehr geräumig, sauber, ruhig mit konfirtablem Bett und blütend weisser, kuscheliger, leichter Bettwäsche !! 
Besonders angenehm: um 04:00 a.m. war ein mini-breakfast-buffet in der Lobby aufgestellt !! Super :-)
Restaurant hingegen: auffallend ""träge"" Bedienung, obschon der Maître d'hôtel sein Bestes tat um Schwung in die Sache zu bekommen ... vergeblich ... also hier -:(",4,2016,05,26

245,Perfekt,Wir haben eine Nacht im Radisson Blue in Dublin geschlafen. Abends angekommen und am nächsten morgen ausgecheckt. Die Übernachtung diente dem zwischenaufenthalt. Der Shuttle hat abends wie auch morgens super geklappt. Durch ein Angebot sind wir in der Junior Suite untergekommen. Alles war in Ordnung und sauber. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Gerne wieder. Danke für den netten Empfang. ,5,2016,05,17

245,Angenehmer Aufenthalt,"Das Hotel ist in unmittelbarer nähe vom Flughafen. Dies ist besonders geeignet für Geschäfte oder späte Ankünfte.  Der Service ist top! Sehr freundlich und Aufmerksam.  Leider hatte uns die Receptionistin fehlerhafte Auskünfte gegeben und deshalb hatten wir unkosten, in diesem bereich gibt es verbesserungs Potential.  Das Frühstück ist super es fehlt an nichts.

245,"Gut gelegenes Airport Hotel, sauber und freundlich ","War für eine Nacht dienstlich dort und war sehr positiv überrascht. Check In war sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und effizient. Zimmer war geräumig und sehr sauber. Gutes Room Service Angebot. Frühstück war ausgezeichnet - sehr große Auswahl, frisch und lecker, ausgezeichneter Service. Ich komme wieder! ",4,2016,04,12
245,Ottima soluzione vicino all'aeroporto,"Il Radisson Blu dell'aeroporto di Dublino si può anche raggiungere a piedi ma l'albergo offre comunque un ottimo servizio di navette che partono dal Terminal 1 e in pochi minuti si è arrivati. Per gli arrivi dopo la mezzanotte è possibile chiamare l'hotel e farsi mandare la navetta in quanto il servizio regolare viene sospeso.
Il check-in è stato veloce, la camera essenziale ma con tutte le comodità, pulita e soprattutto molto silenziosa.
Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione. Il wifi è gratuito e veloce.
La mattina successiva, una navetta ci ha prontamente riportati al Terminal dell'aeroporto.",4,2016,04,03
245,Comodo se atterri tardi o se devi partire presto,"Io e mia moglie abbiamo soggiornato qui perché il nostro volo atterrava alle 23:00 e la maggioranza delle strutture in città non prevede il check-in dopo le 22 oppure ti addebita una maggiorazione di 20/30€ andando a vanificare il possibile risparmio. Siamo stati fortunati a trovare un'offerta su Expedia a 102€ a notte altrimenti il prezzo medio è di 150€. La nostra camera era spaziosissima, era pulita e aveva una grossa finestra che si affacciava sull'aeroporto ed era abbastanza suggestiva la vista notturna con gli aerei che atterrano. Noi siamo stati ad agosto ma in Irlanda di notte fa freddo e nella camera il riscaldamento non è in funzione. Portatevi un bel pigiama pesante e mettetelo nel bagaglio a mano perché se la valigia che avete imbarcato ve la consegnano il giorno dopo soffrirete il freddo come è successo a noi. Il bagno è privato ed è interno alla camera. La colazione non l'abbiamo fatta perché aveva un costo esagerato, circa 12€ a persona. Il servizio navetta da e per i terminal è gratuito ed è perfettamente funzionante. In realtà si può anche arrivare a piedi in 10/15 minuti ma nella maggioranza dei casi si avranno i bagagli al seguito e quindi la navetta sarà la scelta più comoda.",3,2016,03,31
245,Leider kein Radisson Standard,"Obwohl wir mit einem Business-Flughafen-Hotel gerechnet hatten, waren wir von dem Radisson Blu in Dublin enttäuscht. Kleine Details, die fehlten, haben in der Summe dann doch einen eher negativen Eindruck vom Hotel hinterlassen. 

Insgesamt ist das Hotel eindeutig in die Jahre gekommen. Das uns für 2 Nächte zugewiesene Zimmer war in Richtung des Terminals und durch die schlechte Isolierung fühlte und hörte es sich so an, als stünden wir direkt neben den landenen Fliegern. Nach langer Diskussion und Bittstellung wurde uns „gütigerweise“ ein Zimmer zur anderen Seite zugewisen, das deutlich ruhiger war. 
WLAN auf dem Zimmer war zwar langsam aber funktionierte. 

Obwohl wir ein DZ gebucht hatten, war bei unserer Ankunft im Bad leider nur ein Set an Handtüchern. Auf Anfrage wurde uns ein zweites Paar gebracht. 
Auch hatten wir das Gefühl, dass das Personal an der Rezeption nicht besonders zuvorkommend und freundlich schien. Auf unsere „peinlichen“ Touri-Fragen, welcher Bus denn am besten in die Stadt fährt etc. hatte man teilweise keine Antwort parat und es musste erst gegoogelt werden (das hätten wir prinzipiell ja auch selber machen können...). 

Lustigerweise wurden wir von der Dame an der Rezeption dann auch noch zum falschen Busstop geleitet Doch der sehr nette Busfahrer, der eigentlich nur die Staff-Route vom Flughafen zum Hotel fährt hat uns dann ein Stück mitgenommen. 

Frühstück haben wir nicht ausprobiert.",3,2016,03,29
245,nur der Busfahrer kann punkten,"Wenngleich es sich hier auch um ein Flugenhafen Hotel handelt, so sind wir hier doch  immer noch zu Gast bei Radisson Blu, was einen gewissen Anspruch an Komfort und Service wohl rechtfertigt. Schlussendlich wird für diese Erwartung auch gutes Geld investiert.

Das mir zugewiesene Zimmer war gewissermaßen eine Notunterkunft und wurde von mir deshalb abgelehnt. Das Ersatzzimmer ""Businessroom"" war soweit ok. Das Mobiliar war allerdings sehr verschlissen und die Bettwäsche war nicht sauber.

Das Personal war nicht besonders freundlich und insbesondere im Restaurantbereich auch recht inkompetent.  

Ein Lob geht lediglich an den Busfahrer, der uns zur frühen Morgenstunde gut gelaunt zum Terminal brachte.",3,2016,03,26
245,Orrendo e caro,"Esperienza da non ripetere.
La mia camera al primo piano era squallida, con moquette e velluto delle sedie decisamente vecchi e lisi.
Le parti comuni non si presentavano meglio.
In compenso è costato circa 120 euro senza colazione.",1,2016,03,16
245,Confortevole soggiorno,"Camera ampia e molto pulita, qualità del sonno ottima. Bene il servizio bar e ristorante, gentilezza e disponibilità alla reception. Servizio shuttle per aeroporto impeccabile e gratuito.
Bagno in camera dotato di accessori e tutto il necessario. Un po' lente le operazioni di check-in ma tutto sommato accettabili.",4,2016,03,15
245,Kurzer Zwischenstopp,"Ich hatte via Internet für eine Nacht gebucht zu einem extrem guten Preis wie ich später erfuhr. Das Zimmer war überraschend gross (Business-Zimmer), durch die Nähe zum Hotel fast unschlagbar, für kurze Aufenthalte durchaus zu empfehlen, länger möchte ich dort nicht wohnen, da man trotz geschlossenem Fenster, leider die Flieger recht gut hören konnte, Ansonsten war ich allerdings sehr zufrieden.",4,2016,02,29
245,"Gutes ""Flughafen""-Hotel",Sehr gut gelegen. Vom Dublin Airport leicht zu Fuss erreichbar. Weniger als 10 Minuten und nur ein kurzes Stück unter offenem Himmel. Gutes Restaurant und Zimmer zum Arbeiten und Übernachten ok. Hat auch gute Konferenzräume im Hotel.,4,2016,02,28
245,Bravissima Maria,"Abbiamo prenotato qui, perché al mattino avevamo il volo presto. La camera era molto spaziosa, pulita, fornita di accappatoio e ciabatte oltre la macchina del caffè con numerose cialde. Il personale era molto professionale e disponibile, Maria della reception ci ha accolto in modo straordinario, ci ha dato tutte le informazioni necessarie, mi ha aiutato con la carta di credito, ci ha dato una camera superiore e un dessert gratuito.

245,Einem Radisson Blu nicht wuerdig,"Alles in die Jahre gekommen. Unser Zimmer war auf dem Standard von 1999, abgesehen des Fernsehers.  Wuerde nicht empfehlen dort zu buchen. Haare auf dem Kopfkissen, Haare in der Badewanne. Die Toilettenspuelung funktionierte nicht richtig. Das Bett war ebenfalls eher mittelmaessig. Die lage ist super, jedoch wird dieses Hotel anderen Radisson Blu Hotels absolut nicht wuerdig. Die Fugen der Badewannen hatten Schimmel. Da habe ich schon Hotels ohne Stern erlebt die besser waren.",2,2016,01,25
245,Spartanisch und Enttäuschend,"Abgewohntes Hotel in unmittelbarer Nähe des Flughafens von Dublin, der mit einem immerhin kostenfreien Shuttle erreichbar ist. Die Zimmer sind kahl und lieblos eingerichtet und haben ihre besten Jahre wohl hinter sich. Das übliche kostenfreie Upgrade als Concierge Member wurde mir erst gar nicht angeboten, beim Check-In war meine Reservierung zunächst nicht zu finden. Dem Hotel geht nahezu alles ab, was Hotels der Radisson Blu-Kette auszeichnet: Eleganz und Stil. Bohrmaschine am Morgen rundeten das Erlebnis ab.",2,2016,01,09
245,quattro stelle?per niente,"Siamo arrivati a Dublino in tarda serata e avevamo prenotato questo hotel solo per una notte Quando siamo  entrati abbiamo visto un posto trascurato, non vi dico la stanza  si trovava in un seminterrato squallida con una vista sul parcheggio.La colazione è stata ancora peggio,dei prodotti  di scarsa qualità e cucinati ancora peggio.Siamo stati ben felici di aver pernottato solo una notte .",2,2016,01,06
245,Eine gute Wahl nach einem Ireland Tripp!,"Sehr freundliches Personal.
Das Zimmer war dem Preis entsprechend hervorrangend.
In der Bar und dem Restaurant kann man sich bestens verköstigen.
Ein sehr grosses und leckeres Frühstücksbuffet.
Als Ausgangspunkt zum Flughafen perfekt!",4,2016,01,01
245,Hotel funcional practico para área aeropuerto ,"Estuve una semana en este hotel por negocios. Estuve bien, esta bastante limpio , habitación confortable , desayuno normal inglés con judías y demás (puedes pedir huevos fritos o tortilla).
Vistas al aeropuerto. 
Pagas por parking y para ir al centro de Dublín solo queda ir en bus por unas 7 euros creo por trayecto. No hay mas q un pub detrás del hotel donde se cena razonablemente bien y q esta muy animado los fines de semana.",3,2015,12,30
245,Ha ido a menos. Se ha quedado anticuado,"E hotel está ubicado en los alrededores del aeropuerto,de hecho sepuede ir andando. Es un hotel de paso y tipo business pero ha quedado totalmente anticuado: el mobiliario, las habitaciones dejan mucho  que desear. No tiene business center.
Lo mejor es que las habitaciones están muy bien insonorizas y el desayuno que es más que aceptable.",3,2015,12,26
245,"Na ja, Hotel am Flughafen eben.","Es fing schon beim shuttle service an. Die Dame am Telefon konnte nicht erklären wo der shuttle stehen würde. Also, dann eben laufen. Geht gut, nur 10 Minuten. Das Hotel ist nicht teuer für ein Airport Hotel, ist aber auch schon ein bißchen verschlissen. Außerdem stinkt es in der Lobby gewaltig nach Friturfett, igitt. 

Zimmer teil renoviert.",3,2015,12,21
245,Problemas con calefacción y agua caliente,"A la vuelta de nuestro viaje por Irlanda, optamos por este hotel porque nuestro vuelo salía temprano y la ubicación es perfecta. A la ida, pernoctamos una noche en otro hotel cercano, y la experiencia fue buena. Llegamos y la habitación estaba helada, no funcionaba la calefacción ni uno de los dos ascensores. Como la cama solicitada (extragrande) tampoco estaba, bajamos a recepción y solicitamos el cambio. La nueva habitación era de dos camas pequeñas y tampoco tenía calefacción, pero al tener otra orientación aguantamos. La sorpresa vino por la mañana cuando la ducha tampoco proporcionaba agua caliente....sólo templada. Curiosamente de los 6 hoteles en los que nos alojamos a lo largo de nuestro viaje, este tenía la habitación más cara. Con una carta en la habitación pidiendo disculpas por las obras nos quedamos....",2,2015,12,15

245,Una notte e poi via subito!,"Dal punto di vista logistico la posizione è assolutamente perfetta (l'aeroporto si raggiunge anche a piedi, in 5 minuti direi). 
Molto ampie e confortevoli le camere.

Tipico Hotel da Aeroporto ma veramente ""al pelo"", nel senso che è un 4 stelle (!!!) usurato dal continuo passaggio dei viaggiatori e che ""sta su con i denti"". Regna un'atmosfera piuttosto ""gelida""; insomma: una notte e via subito.",3,2015,10,15
245,Schäbige Flughafenabsteige,"Die Zimmer haben schon mehrere Generationen hinter sich. Wenn man sich nicht am aus dem Teppich hervorstehenden Heizungsrohr ohne Heizkörper die Zehen bricht, dann kommt man über den leeren Kühlschrank zu wackligen Handtuchhaltern. Daneben liegt herzlos die billig einmal durch den Kopierer gezogene Speisekarte.
Mein erster Versuch, ein Zimmer zu beziehen, endete mit einem Gast, der schon in dem mir zugeteilten Zimmer war und mich relativ gefasst begrüsste. Muss ich noch sagen, dass einer der beiden Aufzüge permanent kaputt war?",2,2015,10,07
245,Molto comodo,"Abbiamo prenotato in questo hotel, pur essendo molto caro, perché al mattino avevamo il volo presto. La camera era molto spaziosa, pulita, fornita di accappatoio e ciabatte oltre la macchina del caffè con numerose cialde. Il personale era molto professionale e disponibile soprattutto dal momento che il nostro inglese era molto carente. Il mattino, avendo lasciato l'hotel prima dell'orario della colazione, nell'atrio abbiamo trovato bottigliette dell'acqua, dolci e caffè. Abbiamo utilizzato la navetta che è disponibile ogni 15 minuti per 24 ore. Il bar piuttosto caro. La connessione wifi gratuita mi ha dato qualche problema. Unico appunto, il letto matrimoniale era di dimensioni modeste.",4,2015,09,28
245,Ganz o.k.,Ich habe das Radisson Blu aufgrund meines sehr frühen Abflugs in Dublin gebucht - es gibt eine Verbindung mit dem Shuttle-Bus (ca. alle 15 min.) bzw. kann man den Airport auch zu Fuß relativ schnell erreichen. Das Hotel selbst ist ganz o.k. - macht von draußen einen besseren Eindruck als innen / die Zimmer sind etwas abgewohnt aber im Großen und Ganzen o.k. Service war eher durchschnittlich - zB an der Bar oder auch beim Check-In. Kurz gesagt für eine Nacht ganz o.k. - längere Zeit möchte ich hier nicht absteigen.,4,2015,09,23
245,comodo ma caro,"Prenotato per una sera poichè il nostro volo prevedeva un arrivo oltre la mezzanotte.
Personale disponibile e professionale. 
Raggiunto a piedi (circa 15 minuti) perchè non siamo riuscite a trovare la navetta che ci avrebbe accompagnate gratuitamente. Camere dotate di ogni confort, letti comodi.
Colazione ricca ed abbondante. 
Wi Fi non perfettamente funzionante.
Molto caro rispetto altri altri hotel in Dublino.",4,2015,08,29
245,Hotel am Flughafen,"Wir hatten einen Flug um 7 Uhr morgens und wollten daher nahe am Flughafen sein. Wer nur ein Bett zum schlafen sucht ist hier richtig, das Hotel bietet einen Shuttle zum Terminal 1 und Terminal 2 an. Der Bus fährt alle 10 Minuten und ist kostenlos.",3,2015,08,26
245,Befriedigend aber nicht mehr.,"Wenn man weiß wie man gehen soll, dann tut ein 10 Minuten Lauf nach dem Flug ganz gut. Oder man wartet auf den Shuttle - so alle 15 Minuten kommt der.
Sie kommen am Terminal 1 an wie alle Deutschen Gesellschaften? Dann am Ausgang gerade aus und durch das nächste Gebäude noch durch (2 Shops sind links) dann links ca. 40 Meter.
Ruhigste Zimmer: ungerade Nummern.
Standard Zimmer. Bett 160 x 200 cm. Um das Bett 160 cm freie Fläche  jeweils frei.
HD TV 80 cm Diagonale. Schreibtisch mit zusätzlich Schukostecker (Deutsch) und dazu Französischer Stecker. Vorbildlich für Business! 
Dafür kein Strom am Bett, schade! 
W-LAN schnell und kostenfrei. 
Minibar ausgebaut - nicht vorhanden! Sehr viele Regalflächen. Kleiner Schrank. Sehr viele Hängeflächen.
Bad zu kleines Waschbecken. Einstieg Dusche über tiefe Badewanne. Dusche führt zum Abzug, da mit einer Hand zu halten, sonst kein duschen möglich.
Alte Einrichtung aber es funktioniert.  
Dafür 165,-ohne Frühstück ist zu viel. Deshalb insgesamt befriedigend. 
Das reißt auch der Hosenbügler nicht mehr raus!",3,2015,08,12
245,Simple sin más,"Hotel cerca del aeropuerto y realmente alejado del centro. Servicio normal, habitaciones amplias y limpias. El baño con las amenities necesarias para el huesped. El restaurante para la cena lento y muy normalito. 
Hotel de paso sin más.....",3,2015,08,03
245,Schrecklich,"Shuttle Service und Frühstück waren ok. Auf dem Flur roch es schon extrem nach Zigaretten, altes Geschirr stand auf dem verdreckten Boden ( incl Müll). Verwohnte Inneneinrichtung mit kaputtem Bett incl Schimmel ( versteckt hinter einem Brett am Kopfteil ) an der Wand. Die Matratze war zudem noch durch gelegen. Alle Stühle hatten große Flecken auf der Sitzfläche. Mini Bar trotz 4 Sterne nicht vorhanden. Viel sinnloser Stauraum mit fremden Haaren in den kaputten Schubladen. Personal hat freundlich auf die Beschwerde reagiert. ",1,2015,07,27
245,Top für Übernachtung am Flughafen,"Haben hier eine Übernachtung gehabt, um dann tags darauf von Dublin nach Frankfurt zu fliegen. Dazu liegt das Hotel top fasst fussläufig zum Flughafen. Es gibt aber einen kostenlosen Shuttleservice. Zimmer sind sehr schön und modern eingerichtet. Abends lässt es sich an der netten Bar mit freundlichem Service noch einen leckeren Drink nehmen. Wir hatten kein Frühstück gebucht, sondern dann am Flughafen gefrühstückt.",5,2015,07,21
245,Für eine Nacht ok,"Nach unserer Rundreise durch Irland, wählten wir das Hotel. Der Empfang war,  wie es halt bei diesen Hotelketten üblich ist, gekünstelt herzlich. Nach einer Woche B&B in Irland, wo Herzlichkeit auf der Tagesordnung steht, fällt dies doch im Radisson auffallend kühl aus. Der Preis ist für die Qualität der Zimmer etwas überhöht. Die Zimmer sind abgewohnt und fue Minibar war leer. Dafür hatten wir eine Nespressomaschine am Zimmer. Was dann doch die Punktzahl wieder auf 4 hob. Der Fluglärm aufgrund der Nähe zum Flughafen ist natürlich vorhanden jedoch in der Nacht zum Aushalten. Das Restaurant erinnert mehr an ein irisches Pub mit 2 Fernsehern. Die Speisekarte erinnerte mich an eine Sportsbar in den USA als an Irland.  Für den Parkplatz zahlt man zusätzlich Euro 7. Was wiederum 1 Punkt Abzug ergibt, wenn man bedenkt, dass das Zimmer mit Frühstück Euro 150 kostet sollte der Parkplatz inkludiert sein. ",3,2015,07,19

Sono rimasto colpito dalla hall, dalla lobby e dal bar ristorante in cui ho cenato trova da una discreta cucina con piatti sia internazionali che locali. Ovviamente ampia scelta di birra e di vini. Le camere non sono altrettanto valide perché sono un po' vecchie, soprattutto i bagni, comunque non manca nulla. Accoglienza molto professionale e disponibile.",3,2015,07,09
245,valido ristorante,"Sebbene non abbia alloggiato all'Hotel , ho però  auto modo di pranzare due volte in una settimana al ristorante di questo Hotel.Sia il servizio, che il cibo sono risultati alquanto validi.Lo staff è meraviglioso, disponibile ed i cuochi  molto simpatici. I piatti preparati  erano di un cucina internazionale ma, con un occhio di riguardo a piatti del territorio Irlandese. Presentazione dei piatti standard ma porzioni servite alquanto generose. Prezzo pagato equo  rapportato   tra  qualità e servizi . Ottimi prezzi praticati anche per le bevande .",3,2015,07,07

Jetzt zum Hotel das Hotel hat schon bessere Jahre gesehen und auch das Zimmer war sowas von abgewöhnt. Das Bettsofa war mehr ein Trampolin als das man darin schlafen könnte - ich sehe den Namen Radisson Blu für das Hotel bis auf die Mitarbeiter nicht gerechtfertigt, werde auf dem Rückflug auch mal ein anderes Hotel ausprobieren.
",1,2015,07,02
245,Top Lage gutes Frühstück,"Das Radisson Blu liegt nur wenige Gehminuten vom Terminal 2 entfernt. Der Empfang ist sehr freundlich und professionell.

245,Standard experience..,"Struttura sita davanti all'aeroporto con navette che ogni 10 minuti portano ai Terminal (3 minuti). Eccellente servizio alla reception. Camere nella norma, un po' vecchiotte ma pulite. Ottimo servizio bar/ristorante all'interno dell' hotel. Colazione si può fare di più.
Dista 40 minuti in bus dal Trinity college.",3,2015,05,04

Las habitaciones está limpias y el restaurante correcto.",3,2015,04,20
245,"Normal, sólo para dormir","Estuve en el hotel la noche previa a mi vuelta ya que tenía que tomar un avión a las 07:00. Para dormir al lado del aeropuerto está bien pero, por ejemplo no tienen máquinas de vending, así que si ""necesitas algo"" tienes que ir al restaurante. Yo fui a comprar una botella de agua y me pareció excesivo que me quisieran cobrar 6 euros por una botella de litro. El parking es de ticket y barreras, es decir, que te lo cobran por tiempo.La cama doble es de tamaño justo, no tiene minibar y el wiffi va normal.En resumen, nada excepcional.",3,2015,04,07
245,"Comodo, vicino all'aeroporto","Ho scelto questo hotel perchè dovendo lavorare visino all'aeroporto ho la necessità di potermi spostare rapidamente a piedi.

L'hotel è buono, forse leggermente sotto lo standard di altri Radisson Blu, ma comunque ha tutto quello che serve per un soggiorno di lavoro, compresa una camera grande e ben riscaldata (cosa che non guasta mai con i rigidi inverni irlandesi), una scrivania in più per poter lavorare, la possibilità del servizion in camera e della lavanderia, un letto comodissimo.
Facilmente raggiungibile a piedi una piccola spa e palestra.
Ottima colazione, servizio shuttle per l'aeroporto ogni 10 minuti fin dalle prime ore del mattino e personale alla reception di grande professionalità.

Unici aspetti un pò sotto tono: vasca da bagno scheggiata in più punti e con qualche traccia di ruggine in corrispondenza del cristallo paraschizzi e le tubazioni idriche rumorose

Complessivamente lo consiglierei.",4,2015,02,13
245,Gute Lage. Erfüllt den Zweck.,"Die Zimmer sind in gutem, sauberen Zustand. Trotz der Nähe zum Flughafen (5 min laufen) kein Fluglärm. Angenehme Atmosphäre im Hotel, freundlicher Empfang an der Rezeption, Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ok.",4,2015,01,22

Navetta  da e per aeroporto .",5,2014,12,13
245,Pessima esperienza,Ho scelto l'hotel solo per la vicinanza all'aeroporto consapevole di doverci rimanere poche ore: ultimo incontro di lavoro nel tardo pomeriggio e rientro con il primo volo del mattino. La camera non era particolarmente pulita. L'arredo poco funzionale e solo un asciugamano. Ameties praticamente assenti. Il disordine e la sporcizia nei corridoi lungo le camere mi ha sorpresa. Wi-fi lento e a singhiozzo in tutta la struttura. L'unico elemento positivo è il servizio navetta ogni 10 minuti per l'aeroporto. Sicuramente non è al'altezza della catena di cui fa parte.,1,2014,11,18
245,Cerca del aeropuerto y magnifica WIFI,"Hotel ubicado muy cerca del aeropuerto de Dublin, con servicio de transporte gratuito las 24 horas del día.

245,buono per la vicinanza all'aeroporto,"Siamo stati in questo hotel al termine del nostro viaggio in irlanda, è un classico radisson, elegante, pulito, camera ampia, wi fi, mi sentirei di consigliarlo solo per chi come noi deve partire la mattina abbastanza presto, perchè come in quasi tutti gli hotel vicini a strutture tipo aeroporti/stazioni ecc. è un po freddino...c'è solo gente di passaggio e di fretta, non la classica atmosfera festosa di vacanza, comunque è veramente comodo, 5 minuti a piedi dal terminal, anche di meno dai car rental, e comunque ti portano gratuitamente al terminal con una navetta... abbastanza buona la colazione, meno buono il ristorante dove abbiamo cenato la sera del nostro arrivo.
quindi, se arrivate a dublino vi consiglio di ritirare l'auto e di avvicinarvi alla vostra destinazione, se dovete partire da dublino la mattina è la migliore sistemazione disponibile.",3,2014,10,21
245,"Vicino all'aereoporto, non fantastico, ma con qualche plus","E' vicinissimo all'aereoporto, raggiungibile in 5 minuti a piedi: hanno comunque una navetta che fa il servizio 24h al giorno ogni 10 minuti. Le camere non sono belle come quelle di altri hotel della stessa catena, ma comunque sono di buon livello. Il ristorante / bar mi è sembrato buono e abbastanza conveniente. Segnalo il Wi-Fi gratuito ed il fatto che mi hanno portato la colazione in camera alle 4:45 di mattina senza sovrapprezzo (in altri hotel non è possibile fare colazione prima delle 6:30).",4,2014,10,16
245,Ottimo Hotel,Nel complesso un ottimo hotel. Vicinissimo ai terminal con navetta sempre in funzione: perfetto per le partenze notturne. Possibilità di mangiare qualche snack prima della partenza alle 5:00 AM. Qualche difetto  (rubinetteria bagno) e carenza di controllo delle camere (mancava l'asciugacapelli).,4,2014,09,27
245,Ideal für frühe Rückflüge,"Das Hotel liegt fast neben dem Flughafen - trotzdem habe ich keinen Fluglärm gehört. Alle 15 Minuten gibt es kostenlos einen shuttle zu beiden Terminals. Von den Terminals gibt es günstig Busse in die Stadt - einfach ideal. 
Konfortabel ist, dass man im Hotel einchecken kann.
Das Hotel selber ist sauber und empfehlenswert, falls man morgens vor dem Frühstück (6:30) los muss, gibt es in der Lobby kleine Snacks Müsli Riegel, Kaffee, Obst)  zum Aufwachen. Wir hatten Badewanne und im Zimmer noch Kaffeemaschine etc. und einen Balkon.
Leider hat die Rezeption unseren voucher nicht mehr gefunden - also:  unbedingt vorher kopieren.Es hat dann doch noch geklappt.
Meiner Meinung nach stimmt das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis.",4,2014,09,17
245,Una bella sorpresa,"L'hotel è comodissimo per l'aereoporto. Abbiamo avuto l'upgrade gratuito in business class e la stanza era davvero bella. Staff gentilissimo e attento alle esigenze dei propri clienti. Lo consiglio per chi, come noi, aveva la necessità di un alloggio vicino all'aeroporto.",4,2014,09,06
245,Muy buena opción para dormir cerca del aeropuerto,"En general todo estuvo bien. Está prácticamente en el aeropuerto, tiene servicio de transportación las 24 horas, lo que fue muy conveniente ya que nuestro vuelo salía a las 5:45am, así que tomamos el shuttle a las 3:30am y ya ha esa hora tenían botellas de agua, barritas de granola. Nos tocó la habitación de la esquina, con muchas ventanas y a pesar de ello, no se escuchaban los aviones. La habitación amplia, el baño limpio y grande. Wifi gratuito.",4,2014,09,05
245,Airportnah,"Etwas veraltetes Hotel, aber mit ausreichenden Qualitäten im Service und in der Ausstattung. Sogar ein sehr frühes ""kontinental breakfast"" (wir nutzten es um 4.45 Uhr) gab es in der Lobby mit Kaffee, Müsliriegel und Obst!",3,2014,08,20
245,Einfach nur zweckmässig ....,"Im Rahmen unserer Irlandreise verbrachten wir die letzte Nacht aufgrund des frühen Rückfluges in diesem Hotel. Dieses Haus braucht dringend eine Renovierung selbst die Businesszimmer sind dürftigst eingerichtet, alt und muffelig. 
Der Shuttlebus am Morgen klappte gut ..... Hotel bleibt nicht in Erinnerung!!",2,2014,08,07
245,Bello e comodo per l'aereoporto!!,"Sono stata per una sola notte presso questo hotel per motivi di lavoro. Attaccato all'aereoporto quindi utile per chi deve viaggiare. Elegante, pulito e con tutti i comfort!! Colazione fantastica..accontenta tutte le esigenze!!!",5,2014,07,06
245,Comodissimo,"Hotel molto comodo per l'aeroporto, raggiungibile in pochissimi minuti con le navette offerte dall'hotel o anche attraverso il percorso pedonale in meno di dieci minuti.
La camera era molto grande, pulita e silenziosa, con bagno comodo e spazioso.
Abbiamo cenato al ristorante interno, che ci è piaciuto sia come locale (anche se non molto caratteristico), che come qualità del cibo.",3,2014,06,28
245,Buon Hotel comodissimo per l'aeroporto,"Buon Hotel con spazi comuni spaziosi e di buon livello, receptionist gentili e veloci sia per il check-in che per il check-out, attivi 24 ore su 24. Camere spaziose, pulite e dotate di tutti i confort. Ottima qualità del sonno in quanto bene insonorizzato. Colazione continentale con ampia scelta, ristorante un po' spartano e con scelta cibi non all'altezza però decente. Comodità invidiabile per e dall'aeroporto con comodissimo servizio navetta ogni 15/20 minuti. Chi volesse in 5 minuti a piedi si è già all'interno dell'aerostazione.
Inoltre dall'aeroporto, con meno di 5 euro si può arrivare in centro città con gli autobus.",4,2014,06,12
245,Von ein Radisson Blu ist man besseres gewohnt,"mein Zimmer hat unangenehm gerochen. Als ich mich darüber beschwert habe hat man mir gesagt, dass man mir nicht helfen kann. Ich hatte das Gefühl, dass Personal einen schlechten Tag hatte oder es ist ein darüber hinausgehendes Problems....wie auch immer von Freundlichkeit oder gar ein zuvorkommendes Verhalten kann ich leider nicht berichten, was bei anderen Radisson Blue Häusern durchaus üblich ist",2,2014,06,01
245,Comodo per le partenze in areoporto,"L'hotel non è chiccosissimo ma è molto utile se si deve raggiungere l areoporto. La mattina presto la hall è gia attrezzata per farvi un check out veloce e offrirvi gratuitamente te e caffè nei termos! In piu un pulmino navetta ti porta direttamente all ingresso dell'areoporto. I servizi per noi sono stati utilissimi visto che viaggiavamo con bagagli, bimbo e passeggino! In ultimo descrivo la camera che era standard, ma con tutto cio che occorreva. In piu sul lavandino c erano diversi campioncini per la doccia, utilissimi! ",4,2014,05,25
245,Molto comodo per l'aeroporto,"Si raggiunge a piedi dall'aeroporto in neanche 5 minuti. Le camere sono pulite e silenziose. Ottima la colazione, mentre invece il servizio ristorante potrebbe migliorare parecchio. Occhio al parcheggio perchè sono molto cari.",3,2014,05,02
245,Comodo per partenze all'alba,"Abbiamo scelto di alloggiare in questo hotel perchè avevamo il volo alle 7 del mattino. è a poco tempo dal terminal 2 e la navetta è ottima. Noi siamo arrivati nel pomeriggio e il bus ci ha lasciati in fondo al parcheggio, mentre alle 5 del mattino c'era una navetta che partiva proprio davanti all'ingresso dell'hotel.
Al nostro arrivo abbiamo dovuto richiedere un'altra camera, visto che ci avevano assegnato una matrimoniale anzichè una twin. Nessun problema, ci hanno assegnato addirittura una camera business.
Le camere sono ampie, buona wifi, letti comodo, abbastanza silenziosa. Anche il bagno è ampio con la doccia che funziona a dovere. Il rumore dell'aria condizionata in bagno è eccessivo, ma basta spegnerla...
Di sera abbiamo cenato nel ristorante dell'hotel, molto valido con prezzi più che accettabili. Al mattino, per chi lascia presto l'hotel, viene messo a disposizione qualcosa per fare colazione (thè, caffè, acqua, frutta, barrette ai cereali).
Non c'è scritto da nessuna parte, ma ho letto da altre recensioni che l'acqua non è potabile. Visti i prezzi dell'acqua del minibar e del ristorante, consiglio di portarsela dietro.",4,2014,04,30
245,NON ECCELLE,"Servizio Reception ottimo però un tantino freddo e distaccato. Camera con mobilia stile anni '50, divano sofà sporco e macchiato. Ambienti comuni ben tenuti. Ristorante molto carino con scelta di piatti buona. Guinness Ottima! A dire il vero non tornerei per la camera che ritengo più da bettola che da Radisson...",3,2014,04,22
