228,Excellent Service,"It's a great location with fantastic service. I arrived very early from a long flight and Yass was able to get me checked in early. I was able to get into my room, catch up on some sleep before heading out for meetings. 

Overall the hotel is clean and quiet. I had a great stay.",5,2024,10,17
228,Great hotel and local to everything,"Hotel excellent, facilities excellent. Breakfast was lovely, and loads of choice. Ten minutes from main centre and I had a lovely rivet view. Had a problem which was resolved in a very efficient and professional way by the lovely Demi on the reception desk. Thanks for a great stay, definitely recommend Kaz 🙃",5,2023,08,22
228,Amazing Stay,Outstanding hotel and the breakfast was amazing!  The Hotel is located walking distance to all the hot spots.  The rooms were clean.  A BIG shout out to Sergio our waiter who went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable.  Definitely would stay a gain!!!,5,2024,10,14
228,Hilton garden inn at Dublin City center near the river.,A very nice hotel to stay near city center and close to river. Very friendly staff specially Yassine was very helpful to educate us early morning bus ride to the airport. Since we have to leave early they packed us breakfast and provided good coffee in the morning. We had food at the hotel restaurant which was very delicious. Beds are comfortable and room was clean and inviting.  Highly recommended.,5,2024,10,12
228,Great staff Dublin Ireland Hilton Garden Inn,"Upon arrival and unpacking, I realized I had left my wallet on the transfer from the airport. After flying all night, and ready for a rest, I wasn’t sure how to proceed about contacting the shuttle driver. 
I went to the front desk and was greeted by Lorenzo Baldi. Besides him being able to directly reach the driver, he made arrangements for my wallet to be delivered to the hotel later that afternoon. 
Lorenzo reached out to me several times during the day to keep me informed of the status of my misplaced wallet. 
The entire staff there is always very pleasant, but Mr. Baldi truly went above and beyond to help me in what could have otherwise been a difficult situation.",5,2024,10,05
228,Perfect location on the river,"A very good locatopn on the river and only 500 meter from Dublin`s conference center. This means a perfect location. Rooms are fine, a good bed and no noise. Bathrooms also fine, ok you have to shower standing in the bath tub. Very good breakfast buffet. Reception a bit slow.",4,2024,10,03
228,Yass has got you covered,"If you ever need a place to stay in Dublin, this is the hotel to be at. It’s extremely clean and comfortable. The lobby is also home to a restaurant. Yass was extremely helpful and even arranged for a 6 am check in. I highly recommend booking your stay through Yass, he is amazing!",5,2024,09,29
228,Marcos was top notch,"Nice hotel. Very clean and nice staff. Special shout out to Marcos who was very quick and attentive to everyone at the hotel bar despite having a large group of people taking up most of it! 
We were worried we’d have to wait a long time but that wasn’t the case at all!",5,2024,09,28
228,Excellent location on the North Bank of the river Liffey on the red tram line,Great location on the red tram line on the northern bank of the river Liffey. Right next to the Jenny Johnson exhibit. Good quality room as you would expect from Hilton. Breakfast buffet was typical of a hotel breakfast but very good. Rooms were a tad small. That’s were very comfortable. Hotel rooms were quiet.,4,2024,09,25
228,"Nice, central but not touristy.","Really nice hotel.  It's up there price-wise, but you'll pay more for a less nice room with fewer amenities but that is located right in the middle of the touristy part of the city.  We walked everywhere, so if you are mobile, I suggest staying a bit further out and enjoying a slightly less noisy experience (depending on what you're looking for obviously).  Really good breakfast.",4,2024,09,25
228,The staff was amazing especially Ankit and Sai,The staff was amazing and helpful! Sai and Ankit in the hotel bar at Oly’s restaurant were some of the nicest fellas and super helpful with picking out the nicest whiskeys and beers. Very knowledgeable and went above and beyond the call of duty.,5,2024,09,20
228,Avoid first floor rooms on the busy street and don’t move a lot in bed - the springs are loud.,"Stayed here as part of a Globus tour in Dublin for 2 nights.

The lobby and check in were ok except they assigned us a handicap room with low bed, sink, closets and shower.

After much discussion they moved us to a standard room. They showed us to our new room and one key did not work. Got that fixed. Room was ok except we were on the first floor on a busy main street- so lots of noise. The other noise came from the bed springs which were very loud.

Breakfast was good - including many ready made omelets.",2,2024,09,16
228,Great service,Yass helped us out big time when we needed help with our booking. Hotel was clean and perfectly located. The rest of the hotel seems modern and well appointed for travelers looking for a home base during their stay in Dublin. Could not recommend more.,5,2024,09,14
228,"Great stay, great stuff","Great place to stay. Close to a city centre ( walking distance from shopping streets as well)Staff very helpful,  specially Yass ( evening shift) that was super nice, gave fantastic directions and helped me out with postage stamps 😀. Thank you for a great stay",5,2024,09,11
228,Birthday few days in Dublin.,"We stayed here the fifth to seventh of September we were generously upgraded to a room with river views. This stay was part of my sixty fourth birthday and we are Hilton Honors Gold Members, therefore the hotel could upgrade us at its discretion from seventy-two hours of arrival. The hotel is perfectly located for that City of Dublin visit and is on the Airport bus service route. This hotel is perfect to visit all of the attractions, Guinness, Irish Whiskey Distillery, Museums and the famous Dublin pubs, bars and clubs. The shopping centre is very close to the hotel, while the pubs, clubs and bars are across the river. Being a mature couple we enjoyed the evening walk and listening to traditional Irish music over a beer or two. Highly recommend this hotel as it is in a perfect location to thoroughly enjoy Dublin City and all it has to offer. The rooms are large, massive comfy beds with powerful showers in their bathrooms. Breakfast is an all you can eat buffet of hot and cold servings. We would definitely stay here again. Dublin is expensive. We found we were spending €100 to €150 Euro a day and we had breakfast included in our hotel.",5,2024,09,10
228,"Thanks, Yass!","We had an amazing experience at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre, thanks to Yass. At 3 AM, after an error with our ride to the airport, Yass stepped in to help our large family, including a baby. He was incredibly calm, friendly, and professional, going above and beyond to arrange a new ride for us quickly. Not only did he resolve the issue with ease, but he also provided us with ice for our travels to store the baby’s milk. His kindness and exceptional service made a stressful situation much easier. We are very grateful for his help and highly recommend staying here!",5,2024,09,09
228,Enjoyed our 3 day stay,"We enjoyed our visit to Dublin. The hotel is far but close enough to city center so it isn’t crazily loud. The staff was friendly,professional, accommodating. Amy was our initial introduction & she was very helpful. Unfortunately I do not remember the female who helped us on Sunday afternoon in reserving a taxi for early Monday am. Yass was quite helpful & pleasant at 5am to see us off to the airport.",5,2024,09,09
228,Good experience,"""Sheiba provided outstanding service! Friendly, helpful, and always attentive, she made our stay fantastic with great local tips and a welcoming attitude. Highly recommended!"" Amazing stay with a group of friends. And the location is very good",5,2024,09,07
228,Excellent Stay at Hilton Garden Inn Dublin,"Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre is a fantastic choice for a stay in Dublin. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. The location is also perfect, within walking distance to many popular attractions. I have to give a special shout-out to Sai from the bar - he was incredibly friendly and always ready to serve us drinks. Definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2024,09,07
228,Good Hotel - Safe and Clean,"This hotel is clean and well appointed. I did have some issues that seem to come up in recent hotel stays. Used glasses not replaced when the room was cleaned. Not enough towels or hangers. The hair conditioner bottle was empty and they were quick to bring a full one up. But when I returned to my room, the replacement bottle was still on the floor if the shower. They hadn’t taken the empty one away and put the full one in its place. Minor inconveniences for sure but annoying when they all happen in the same stay.",4,2024,09,05
228,"Best first day of two week trip made by Hilton Garden employee, ‘Sheiba’.","‘Sheiba’, front desk, went above and beyond to make sure our short stay was very comfortable. She was very polite and professional. She accommodated the six of us arriving from the states with early check in. She help make the first day of our two week trip abroad memorable. Thank you, Sheiba, and Hilton Garden.",5,2024,09,05
228,Great Hotel for a stay in Dublin,"Nice hotel, with good size rooms (and AC!) and an excellent breakfast.  Well-situated right on the river, and very close to the tram lines.  You can easily walk within 15 minutes to Trinity College, Temple Bar, and O'Connell street.  Bonus:  A short tram ride gets you easily to the Guinness Factory or the Heuston station, where you can then take trips to other interesting parts of Ireland like Kilkenny and Waterford if you wish.",5,2024,09,01
228,M&S Dublin Trip Aug.2024,"Very nice stay at this location. Right on the Liffey, plenty of places to tour close by. Great service from the time we got here. From the front desk to the restaurant. Easy access to the Dart (rail system)and Uber & Taxi. I big Thanks to Yass for all his insight and help. It was a pleasure working with him. ",5,2024,08,26
228,Sergio Rocks!!,"I would like to complement the wait staff that waited on me, my husband and friend.  They were extremely courteous.  They made sure that we had everything we needed and were there to help with whatever we asked for.  Sergio was an awesome waiter.  We asked for some soup to go for one of our friends and he delivered it promptly.  After we continued to visit together, he noticed that the soup had gotten cold.  He returned it to the kitchen to re-warm.  So very kind.  Plus, he had a wonderful smile!  Thank you Sergio.",5,2024,08,25
228,Expectations exceeded,"Sergio in at the bar was amazing.  Went out of his way to take care of us after a long travel day.  He could teach customer satisfaction. Made a huge difference in our stay.  I ordered some soup to take back to the room for my wife.  When it sat for 5 min and cooled, he insisted that it be warmed up before I left.",5,2024,08,25
228,"A great hotel, bolstered by a fantastic staffing team  -  especially Yassine (!)","I'm fortunate enough to stay regularly at this hotel, by virtue of my company's office being nearby. I have perhaps accrued >20 stays in the last 12 months, and would advocate a consistently pleasant experience with each visit.

The hotel itself is reasonably modern, with all the amenities you'd expect  -  with the accompanying quality you'd hope for. The restaurant/bar keeps a diverse menu of food & drink, the gym is well equipped & 24/hr access, and there is a business/conference area as required.

The rooms themselves are very spacious, even the 'lower tier' options. They are meticulously cleaned prior to checkin, and there is a real sense of professionalism in the presentation upon 'opening the door'.

It is the staffing team though that are the greatest asset to this establishment, with every member being a truly 'extra mile' individual. As a sum of its parts, there are no weak links in terms of the team  -  and every employee fits in to a very high standard of customer service..... even managing to appease the most challenging of visitors (every hotel has them right?)

I would like to take the opportunity to call out one individual in particular  -  Yassine, who holds the title of 'Night Auditor'. I am an early riser by nature, and frequently look to use the gym in the early hours (circa ~4am). At this time, I would usually walk past the front desk and converse with Yassine. He always goes out of his way to ask how I am, and takes a genuine interest in the quality of my stay  -  genuinely taking a sincere pleasure in using his role to improve my stay in any way possible. He is friendly, engaging, professional  -  and always takes a genuine interest in guest (not just myself  -  he is great at interacting with all guests in this manor). To me, he epitomises what 'great customer service' is all about.

I'll continue to use this hotel wherever possible, and not just due to the geographical convenience of my professional travel. A great stay, and an easy recommend.",5,2024,08,19
228,One night stay!,"The hotel was at an amazing location. With such an amazing view for a Queen room.
Very quiet no disturbances. The front desk was quick to answer any of my questions. The most surprising thing was that there’s a shop open 24hours beside the reception, which made such a difference when I didn’t have anything in the room, and there they had water, energy drinks, crisps etc, was so great to see this! 
The room was very cozy. Would definitely stay again!",5,2024,08,13
228,Hilton Gardens Restaurant,The hotel restaurant was very good. The food was excellent and the staff was very pleasant. Shoutout to my server Ankit he was really good and very friendly. Highly recommend the roasted chicken supreme. It was very good. The beers were cold and they had a lot of draft options.,5,2024,08,09
228,old classic but time for a facelift,"Ive been going to this hotel over the years and enjoying my stays. Things now are a bit outdated but service remains good. Location is relatively convenient. A bit of a walk to the actual city center but It is quite pleasant to walk around in Dublin.
Professional front desk. Attentive and helpful. Restaurant: not so fab food. More of a standard hotel grub style that you avoid altogether, especially given the good city restaurant offerings. Even the breakfast Buffett is only so so. It has deteriorated over the years, meaning lesser quality of products, but ok for a quick bite if you don't mind large loud crowd gatherings.
The rooms
Although generally quiet, noise can be noticeable during the day from the cleaners. Lots of banging, chatting and vacuuming. Of course that only affects you if you have to day sleep. Its a bit a of a maze on the floors. Probably not the best hotel if ever there was an emergency. Rooms are very similar. Fast aging furniture, TV and amenities. If you get a bathtub it'll be a huge climb into it and a huge climb out onto slippery surfaces. Terrible design and never updated. Also a huge bathroom door that opens inward and blocks half the bathroom access. Terrible design and much in need of an update to perhaps a sliding door and all shower options. Also very little counter space around the sink. My long time challenges are with hotels that insist on keeping wall to wall carpeting. It's just not necessary anymore and very unhygienic. Bedding is deep winter warm but at least there is good control over the thermostat. The latest nuisance is the thermostat runs on a 4 hour timer. That means, if you run hot like me and manage to sleep more than four hours, you'll wake up in a sweat because the thermostat auto shut off mid sleep. Terrible idea by management. Limited tv channel choices but decent, non secure wifi. Best to bring your own shows on a laptop if in need of entertainment. Beds are very comfortable, rooms are relatively small. A facelift is much needed. Eliminate old dark furniture, modernize rooms to 21st century. That would bring this hotel many more stars. Altogether comfortable stay, as long as you bring slippers and don't fall to your death climbing into a ridiculous tub",4,2024,08,06
228,Great location and super quiet.,"You know what to expect from Hilton and this one does not let you down.Great location,close to tram and train stations and a nice stroll to city center.I did not hear a person from our room the week we visited,,very quiet room.I would recommend this hotel to anyone that doesn’t want to worry about their room.",5,2024,08,02
228,Lovely place,"Delicious food. Excellent service by Pamela and Marcos. Recommend the seafood chowder, cod and mussels! Lovely place to have group dinner with some catch up. Music is not too loud and we can have a chat there too! This is our second time here and we love it",5,2024,07,31
228,Warm hospitality,"Thanks for the warm hospitality, excellent services - Pamela and Marco! Spicy Chickens Wings, lovely Steaks and delicious desserts! Only thing is we wish the tea was a little stronger.
All the others of the group enjoy there meals too so will happy come back another time.",5,2024,07,31
228,Dinner with friends,"We had a lovely dinner with a group of friends. Pamela, Marco  were excellent serving us, very friendly and helpful. Pamela suggested the salmon dish, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The meal was delicious and the restaurant was beautiful and cozy.",5,2024,07,31
228,Fab dinner at Hilton Dublin,"Excellent service and delicious food.  

Paddy and Martin did a fabulous job, such fantastic food from start to finish.

Thank you so much. We are so grateful. 

Pamela and Marcos were so so brilliant.

We are leaving very satisfied and happy with everything.",5,2024,07,31
228,Charges for drinking water in bedroom! Is a disgrace and creates negative memories of hotel,"Nice hotel in good location, friendly reception (night porter checked us in)  room clean,  you need some complimentary drinking water in the rooms, apparently this Hilton Hotel now has a Policy to charge guests for drinking water. And that may be okay if the room rate was reasonable but it’s not on a Saturday anyways. They don’t even put any products in the mini bar so if you require drinking water in your room at this hotel prepare to pay and also get it before coming to your room. Apart from this hotel is standard no Drinking water build into the price of room rate really spoils the welcome and leaves negative memories. Let me ask you why Hotel management do you need to have this policy?  Please don’t say it’s to provide better rates for your guests because we all know that’s BS.",2,2024,07,27
228,Simple but clean,"No feel-good atmosphere, you only want to stay here for 1-2 nights. The breakfast selection and quality was simple. The room was clean, but you only want to stay here for a short time: Too small and uncomfortable. The food we ordered was brought to the room quickly. I would try a different hotel next time.",4,2024,07,27
228,Handles large parties well!,"Came to dine at Oly’s and had a great time. I ordered the Pepperoni and chili flake pizza along with a party of seven—all were satisfied. I was even able to take some leftover pizza home! Shoutout to our server, Pamela, who was extremely kind and stayed on top of our table’s needs. Will be coming back next time I’m in Dublin!",5,2024,07,24
228,Highly recommended Hilton Garden Inn,"I went to Hilton Garden Inn with my friends. Warm welcome by the staff. All staff members were friendly and professional. Specially,  I would like to thanks Ana, Heena and Sara. I had breakfast with my friends. I highly recommend Hilton Garden Inn for all kind of occasions. Great work guys. Keep it up.",5,2024,07,23
228,Great team and great location,"Great location and super friendly front office team. Special thanks to Yass for his help with my checkout and transfer to airport.  Room was clean, in room dining was quick and with variety of options. I will definitely return back on my next trip in October.",5,2024,07,23
228,Hilton Dublin Great!,"We stayed at Hilton Garden Inn Dublin for 8 nights. Location is great for walking to City Center.  Train and Tram stations easy walk from hotel. We would return to this location in the future. Our airline carrier canceled our flight same day as departure. Yass,  from the front desk was very helpful and professional during a very stressful situation. He worked with me to extended our reservation and provided helpful tips for rebooking airlines.",5,2024,07,22
228,Attentive staff,"The breakfast menu is good and team in general is very attentive, Heena Chawla from the breakfast team and Geory from management/ front desk stand out with their attentiveness during my stays as noticed. 
The team continually improves on feedback.",5,2024,07,22
228,Fantastic eats and even better service!,"The Hilton Garden Inn is such a great place to stay if you’re in Dublin. It’s pretty central and near buses on trains. I stayed for 7 days total at the Garden Inn and so much of the magic was in the service I received. Everyone was absolutely accommodating to any special needs I had, dietary and room wise, as I was traveling with my mother. We ate at the restaurant, Oly’s, every morning for breakfast and most evenings for dinner where Sai and the rest of the crew took such great care of us! The food was absolutely yummy! The soups are great for a light meal. I highly recommend the cod! It’s light and fluffy and well seasoned!",5,2024,07,21
228,Short trip in Ireland,"We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn City Centre in Dublin. The staff were really friendly and helpful, especially Juan Lopez. He went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and gave us some awesome tips on where to eat and what to see around downtown. He also made sure that our stay was comfortable by offering to keep our luggages safe before our check-in time while we explore the city minus our heavy luggages. He did this again during our check-out knowing our flight was later in the evening. Little details like this matters  the most especially when traveling. We really appreciate what Juan had done for us in making our stay comfortable and memorable. 

The rooms were nice and clean, with housekeeping taking care of things every day, including changing the bathroom curtains, and fixing the beddings daily, which was a nice touch. We’ve been to many hotels and majority fall short in this category. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely choose this hotel again next time we're in Dublin.",5,2024,07,16
228,A hotel that does everything right!,"This hotel did everything right. We were there 2 nights. It's quiet, nice bathtub, great a/c, good breakfast, 4 stars. It is exactly as advertised, and we were impressed. The walk to town is about 15 minutes, nothing too cumbersome. Nice safe area.",5,2024,07,15
228,Backache,"If you are happy to wake with bad back then do book this hotel. Do not expect to hear or see any Irish people. Fully expect your food order to be wrong. 
It doesn’t even deserve 1star. Worst place I’ve stayed. Serious language barrier between staff and residents. Also not nice being served food with waiter who smells of body odour.",1,2024,07,15
228,Amazing service,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Oly's Restaurant in the Hilton Garden Inn, Dublin, and was thoroughly impressed by the exceptional service provided by our waiter, Sai. From the moment we arrived, Sai made us feel welcome with his warm and friendly demeanor. He was incredibly attentive, ensuring that all our needs were met without being intrusive.

I highly recommend dining at Oly's and asking for Sai if you want an exceptional experience. Thank you, Sai, for making our evening special!",5,2024,07,13
228,Great service and food,"We ate at Oly’s restaurant and had a wonderful meal and some of the best ice cream ever. Our waiter, Ankit, made good recommendations and was very accommodating. The hospitality was so warm and friendly. This hotel has great service and beautiful surroundings. It is perfectly situated on the river and the staff makes us feel special. Very clean, and relaxing atmosphere.  I highly recommend this hotel and restaurant.",5,2024,07,11
228,"Pricy, just OK","As a Hilton Honors member I expected more for the price of this hotel. The room was nice enough - one of the few on our trip  with plenty of outlets for device charging. It was nice that the window opened. But, instant coffee? I didn’t know they still made it. We never found the hairdryer. The hallways were constantly littered with dirty dishes, some sat for more than a day. The breakfast was barely passable. We had stale bread toast with no butter. Never got service for eggs. Most of the food items on the buffet were empty for the full hour we were at breakfast. Tables were not bussed and the one we found had not been wiped since the last customers and food was scattered about the table and the floor. We didn’t have much better luck in the bar in the evening. Service was painfully slow. Food was mediocre. One evening we waited 30 minutes for service then were told that the kitchen just closed. It wasn’t closed when we sat down. Both the bar and the restaurant were very expensive for what you get. Next visit we will pick a different hotel.",3,2024,07,11
228,Wonderful Stay,"The hotel was very clean and accomodating. Staff member Yass was especially professional, friendly, helpful and pleasant! If we visit Dublin again we will be sure to stay at Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre again. Thank you for the wonderful experience.",5,2024,07,09
228,Costumer,"I visited that hotel yesterday . Hotel is amazing staffs are amazing especially there is a staff the call  navas , he was amazing helpful . I like this area all staff are friendly . I am gonna visit here again for sure because ı am happy to stay in ıreland Hilton garden in",5,2024,07,08
228,Great Experience every morning in the restaurant/lobby area,"We stayed here June 12 to June 16.   My husband and I would go down to the restaurnat/lobby every morning to have a cup a coffee and hot chocolate, while we were waiting for kids to get ready.   Lekhnath greeted  us every morning, with a smile.  He was very personable and attentive.  My husband said he made the best coffee he had in Ireland.",5,2024,07,07
228,Just ok,"Looks better on pictures. The river view rooms quite small with few extras in the bathroom. Below average breakfast with medium quality ingredients. The personnel is by 90% non Irish. Overrated for sure. Though, it is clean and in good location…",4,2024,07,02
228,Exceptional Service,"Excellent location since it's very close to the city, decent rooms and good facilities. The restaraunt ""Oly's"" is amazing with good foof and beautiful staff. I visited with my family and was treated so well by the staff. Sai was very friendly and made sure that our meal was as per our requirement. He suggested some of the best things from the menu and everything was extraordinary. He also helped us find some interesting places around the city. Overall a fantastic experience.",5,2024,07,02
228,Worth a visit,"Very good stay for 6 nights. On arrival we had an upgrade which was nice and unexpected. Staff were very efficient and friendly room clean and refreshed every day. The room at the back so it was very quiet, hard to believe it was in a bustling city. 
Would recommend to anyone Thanks",5,2024,06,28
228,Amazing staff in a nice hotel!,"A huge shout out to Yas who worked the night shift! There was a mix-up with our room and he was extremely accommodating and helpful with what could have been a very stressful situation for our family. 

Hotel is clean, stylish and in a great location. Breakfast was awesome! 

We hope to come back and will definitely stay here!",5,2024,06,25
228,Accommodating and clean,"After arriving early in the morning, the hotel was kind enough to accommodate a very early check in.  Thanks to Yass and the rest of the staff for going the extra mile.  

This is a great launching point for a Dublin adventure. I would recommend a stay here.",5,2024,06,23
228,10/10,"We had a great time chitchatting and drinking, thanks to Sai and Francisco for taking good care of us. 10/10 recommend, totally worth it! Classy vibe and ambience, credit goes to the whole team. Make sure you try their “Custom house pick me up”.",5,2024,06,19
228,Staff review,The service was excellent and amazing and the staff sai and Francisco were so good to us and we loved the place and the ambience was so delighted by the aroma and good staff loved it. I'll come again with more friends soon and we had a great night tonight really loved it. Keep it up guys 😉,5,2024,06,19

228,Awesome Bartenders at Oly!,This hotel is outstanding. Our favorite bartender was Viraj! He did outstanding job and it was a real pleasure to visit with them. The hotel is very nice and highly recommended! The location is perfect for a Dublin visit…we will definitely come back!,5,2024,06,19
228,Food for thought,"I had lunch at the bar, navas was a great help and a great host  unfortunately  the food wasn't  up to par as the staff I had the fish and chips fish was overcooked and the chips where fried in oil that was to hot but the mint peas are to die for so staff great food disappointing  hotel is clean and pleasant  to be in would recommend  the hotel and staff any day",5,2024,06,18
228,Very convenient for the Convention Centre,"4 minutes walk from the convention centre at which I had a meeting to attend. A very comfortable room; the wifi was excellent, allowing me to work without hindrance. The Front desk and bar staff (especially Sai and Usmita) were friendly, polite and very helpful. Breakfast was exceptional - never had to wait for a table even at peak times, options enough without being overwhelming. The waffle maker was great. The quality of food at Oly's was outstanding.",4,2024,06,17
228,"Paid too much, received too little.","Hilton Garden Inn Dublin was a mixed bag. It’s a large hotel so it’s not always to keep on top of everything, but it did seem the smaller things to a standard hotel stay were neglected. 

For example, the soap in the bathroom wasn’t replenished and therefore ran out after 1 squirt. The running water was only luke warm. The tissue box in the room was left, next to empty. At breakfast the glasses for the juices ran out so people were using coffee mugs instead. 

Additionally, we also arrived after check in and our room wasn’t ready so had to wait around. So little things, when added together, can make a stay less enjoyable. 
Had these little aspects not existed, it would have been a better experience. However, the hotel is not cheap so it isn’t unfair to expect a better standard than what we experienced. 

The outside of the hotel was badly littered and a bit grimy which is probably no fault of the hotel as the whole of Dublin was litter strewn and grimy. How on earth the city has been allowed to get like this is beyond me. 

The on-site restaurant and bar, Oly’s, is very good and probably comparable, price wise, to places away from the hotel.

If we were to stay again in Dublin, I would definitely try a different offering.",3,2024,06,17
228,"Nice hotel, nice staff, good location","Very clean rooms. As an American, did wish there was a streaming service option on the TV. It was an ideal location to downtown, just about everything within a 20 minute walk. Great staff at the hotel, very helpful. Lovely bartender Lekhnath.",5,2024,06,17
228,Thank you Pamela and Christian!,Nice hotel in a good location on the Temple Bar side of the river. Thank you to Pamela and Christian for the warm  welcome and wonderful service in the bar and restaurant for dinner. Your patience and care made our vacation that much more enjoyable.,5,2024,06,13
228,Oly’s Restaurant,"The service at the hotel restaurant- Oly’s was outstanding. 
Pamela the Asst. F&B manager provided great service and was very pleasant to deal with.  
The breakfast buffet was delicious too.
The rooms are up to date and quite comfortable for he three night stay.",5,2024,06,12
228,Business and Leisure time in Dublin,"Great hotel for both business and leisure. The breakfast is gorgeous and the bar/restaurant are always welcoming.

A special thank you to Alexandra who welcomes at the restaurant with her wonderful smile and takes care of you at every second you are there, making you feel very special.",5,2024,06,11
228,First trip to Dublin,"Hotel situated close to airport and city center. Easy access via Dublin Express. We were greeted by hotel check in staff, Yass, professionally. He is courteous, humble and addresses our needs.  A great shout out to him.  We love the river facing room.  It is clean and up to date.",5,2024,06,10
228,Try the hotel restaurant! No need to search for dinner. It’s right there!,"Oly’s, the in-house restaurant, is a delightful surprise.—not at all the typical ordinary hotel fare. The chicken tikka is the best I’ve ever eaten, complex and perfectly spiced. My husband says the Irish beef stew is the best he’s had in years. Both entrees were tender and delicious. Thanks to Rakesh and Sai for a great first dinner in Dublin.",5,2024,06,09
228,Highly recommended they restaurant,"Alejandra was really kind and friendly, and Christian suggested us a really nice wine. There were five of us and all the food arrived on time, food was excellent and the attention too, thank you very much. This restaurant is highly recommended.",5,2024,06,06
228,Great location and staff,"Great location close to the airport and an easy walk to the city center. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Comfortable beds. Clean and big, perfect for the family. The breakfast had a lot of options and was very good. Great spot and would stay here again.",5,2024,06,06
228,First time in Dublin.,"The location is pretty good. Can easily walk to many areas including Temple Bar and O’Connell street. Javier (Pizzaro) was our bartender in their bar Lou he and he was fantastic. Great last name that’s why I remember :)
Beds were comfortable and it was nice that they had water available in the rooms (complimentary) and it was pretty clean. Overall good stay.",4,2024,06,04
228,5 Stars to Weronika!,This hotel has the best and most helpful front desk staff.  Especially Weronika!  I am partially disabled and walking is difficult. She was so helpful to me and went out of her way to be sure I had everything I needed to get self in.  I give her 5 stars!!,5,2024,06,01
228,Always my go to Hilton in Dublin,"I always prefer coming to the Hilton here  when I’m visiting Ireland and it’s always perfect from the convenience of the location to the staff that provide us with amazing service. A special mention to Ankit, who was very friendly and made us feel very welcomed and also Pamela and javier who took our order. Finally Christian who served us whiskey sours to perfection. Overall it’s always going to be our “go to” Hilton and we will definitely be visiting again.",5,2024,05,30
228,My first wonderful trip to Ireland ,I can't say enough about Sheiba who works the front desk. She was so accommodating and sweetest young lady. She made our stay amazing. Along with Nemi and Adrian. Best place to stay in Dublin. Thank you for all you did for us. Definitely will stay there again.,5,2024,05,29
228,Great place to land upon arrival in Dublin,"The hotel was in keeping with what I expect to find at a Hilton property. The service was very good. We were very jet-lagged upon arrival and they took our bags and held them. Then they let us check in a bit early, which was a very welcome surprise. The location is good. We were able to walk everywhere, although we did get fairly tired as we were still jet-lagged from our flight. I would definitely stay again in Dublin.",5,2024,05,28
228,"Best hotel in Dublin, especially appealing for U.S. travelers","We stayed in Hilton Garden Inn only for one night, because the other hotel that we booked through Booking.com said there was no room for us when we checked in the place! We searched through our Hilton Honor app and found a very good rate for this hotel. The other hotel was kind enough to pay our taxi to get us there. We felt in haven in this very Hilton hotel - clean, efficient check-in, friendly, large room! Oh, the room brings back us back to U.S. We can actually walk in the room without tripping over our luggage! The location of the hotel also very convenient, to tram, downtown, walk across river, car rental, or airport shuttle. Everything is just perfect. It saved our day and night! We stayed in 3 hotels in Dublin and this one is by far the best! Next time if we ever travel to Dublin again, this is the only one that we are going to stay.",5,2024,05,28
228,"Fine stay, but laundry facilities could be expanded","We appreciated the fact that there were laundry facilities on site, but for the length of our stay, the washer and dryer were occupied by others, and only one dryer was working, which backed up the process considerably. We ended up not being able to do any laundry, which was a disappointment as it was one of the reasons we stayed at the hotel.",3,2024,05,27
228,Ask for Pamela,What a great hotel! The staff had impeccable hospitality. Pamela was especially accommodating. Her patience and guidance made our dinning experience and overall stay wonderful. The Centre location… the staff.. the city..all reasons to  stay!  The staff also found out it was my partners birthday and went out of their  way to make us feel special.,5,2024,05,27
228,Great Dublin Hotel with Wonderful Services,"We enjoy staying at this hotel when we visit Dublin. The staff are all very helpful and go out of their way to accommodate all request. Our waitress, Pamela, at their resturant,  Oly's, was super nice and gave very professional service.  Will be staying again on our next trip to Ireland.",5,2024,05,26
228,Fun in Dublin ,"We had a lovely time in this hotel.  It was close to many tourist destinations.  It was clean, roomy and a good spot in the city.

The front desk crew took care of us both on coming and going.  They were very helpful.  There were rooms available for an early check in and they helped us with cabs as well.",5,2024,05,26
228,Excellent service!,We stayed at Hilton Garden Inn Dublin for two nights. Alejandra was our server in the hotel restaurant. She has the best customer service! She is friendly and efficient and has a great disposition. We kept sitting in her area so she would be our waitress. She’s a great asset to your team 😊,5,2024,05,23
228,"Clean hotel, good service, convenient location.","Stayed one night here after our Ireland vacation before flying home the next day. The hotel is not too far from the shopping areas and right by the tram for ease of transportation. The check-in process was smooth and everyone we talked to at the desk was very helpful, including arranging for a cab if needed. The breakfast seems a little overpriced for what you get, but it was convenient. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable - overall a good stay.",5,2024,05,21
228,"Solid hotel, good location.","Comfortable hotel, convenient location, good breakfast. One thing that I didn't appreciate is that I wanted to leave a suitcase behind and collect after a week touring the in countryside. They don't hold luggage! That was a surprise as I have  stayed in many Hilton hotels and all of them are willing to keep luggage. 

Elevators are small and quite slow, getting up to the room with bags can take some time.",4,2024,05,18
228,Worst Hotel ever and very bad treatment from the reception staff,"Worst Hotel Ever, I donot know how it bears the name of Hilton, very outdated and tired, very bad breakfast, very basic rooms, the worst of all is the attitude of the reception staff, especially their Operation manager Alina. Very rude and they make fatal mistakes like handing you the bill (with all the personal details of another customer) and when you demand for your own bill, they will give the worst treatment ever as if they are trying to cover for something (they can charge you for 4 nights and give you bill of 3 nights), check your bill and try to avoid the hotel at all costs, it is realty amongst the worst in Dublin and maybe in Europe. Also the Gym to very rusty and believe it or not they always having toilets flooding the main reception",1,2024,05,16
228,Great Hotel in Dublin,"The hotel was nice and conveniently located in between the city center and the 3Arena where we were in town to see a concert. The room we had was spacious and had a fridge. There was even a fan in the closet for me to use, which I loved b/c I have to have a fan or AC noise to sleep. The restaurant was nice too and the food was great. Would stay here again.",5,2024,05,16
228,Good time lots to see,"We had an ok time at the Hilton. Rooms were a little tight. 
Bathrooms too. Tub not meant for elderly people way too high.
One of our bright spots was Sheiba who worked at the front desk. She was lovely took care of us and came over to greet us when we walked in the door. People make the business.",4,2024,05,16
228,Lovely hotel close to many attractions,We stayed here for 6 nights. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The housekeeping staff top notch. Every day we can back to a made bed. The bathtub was great for a long soak after a busy day of adventures. The breakfast was amazing. We were very pleased.,5,2024,05,11
228,Excellent Service,"I’ve been for two nights in Hilton and visited several Restaurants in Ireland and the service of Alejandra was amazing.

I’ve been for two nights in Hilton and visited several Restaurants in Ireland and the service of Alejandra was amazing.",5,2024,05,09
228,Great experience,"We received awesome customer service! My family and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre for two days. We spoke with Fronmsco and he was welcoming and helpful with places to go around Dublin. Such as tours and live music. Also, the food was amazing",5,2024,05,09
228,Perfect romantic trip.,"We booked on a third party website, when we came to the room it was a disability accessible reserved room with a low bed and even a lower toilet, me and my partner are both not disabled we decided to call the front desk and ask if everything went right, 
Without hesitation they got us a fitting and clean room, With a view of the river. 
The breakfast was amazing, every morning self made waffles was great. And amazing diner services at Oly’s restaurant. Specifically our servers Pamela who was there for both our meals who was sweet and provided excellent service and our server Ankit who came to our table swiftly and kindly took our order. Where after we were served a gorgeous meal. 
When you take the elevator and there is staff onboard they wil make a little chat with you and are very polite. Overal impeccable service from both the hotel and restaurant staff. Would definitely return to this location for another stay.",5,2024,05,03
228,Great option for the city centre,"This is our second stay at this hotel and it is once again a solid choice for central Dublin. A standout is the restaurant, Oly’s. Really good food, especially the fish and chips and their burgers! Pamela provided excellent service tonight.",5,2024,05,03
228,Nice staff,"The room was clean and very comfortable, with a view of the river which was beautiful to see, especially at night. 
Very clean hotel, the staff were all very polite. 
I would like you to pass the message on to the lady who helped me with my bags when I brought them to reception, a very friendly lady, smiling and with a fun sense of humor, I believe she is from the management team as she has a white blouse and wears glasses, If I'm not mistaken, I believe the lady's name is Christine. Please pass on my words of thanks.",4,2024,05,03
228,Pleasant stay at a central location,"Quick check-in and check-out, good breakfast with a reasonable variety of food, good quality of sleep and in a great location, near the Dublin Connolly train station.

Only downside is the price, considering it's an expensive hotel for what it offers. Still, unfortunately, this seems to be the norm also with other hotels around the same area, so this isn't an issue that only affects this hotel in particular.",5,2024,05,02
228,Look for Armando at Costa coffee / ground floor restaurant. Best staff ever!,"I had a good stay. Location is great. Nice staff at front desk and always ready to help.  Most importantly, I would like to thank Armando from Costa coffee / Oly's restaurant for always being helpful every time we get our breakfast. It is very nice of him to remember our order every morning.  We feel like VIPs.",5,2024,05,02
228,Dining was an awful experience,"I had an early start the next day, so decided to eat at the hotel restaurant “Oly’s”. I went down at 8 pm and left at 9.15 pm having not eaten. I ordered one dish which took 45 mins to arrive and was not cooked. I was promised they would recook and prioritise, but after 30 more mins I gave up and left. Glasses were constantly being broken in the background during my 90 minute experience. The operation was a complete mess. I recommend the deli called Fresh around the corner for those that find themselves in a similar situation.",1,2024,04,30
228,Great hotel in a fabulous location,"Hilton’s always have comfortable beds and pillows and this was the case at this hotel. 
Clean room & bathroom. Nice fresh fluffy towels & a fridge. Perfect view over the river Liffey. We were given 2 small bottles of water at checkin as complimentary which would have been nice to have been replenished during our 3 night stay. Also, no biscuits in the room and inconsistent coffee and tea replenishments. We didn’t have breakfast at the hotel.",4,2024,04,28
228,"Exceptional Service, Delicious Fare","The experience here was amazing from start to finish! As soon as we walked in, Pamela's warm welcome instantly made us feel at ease, setting the tone for a fantastic evening ahead. Christian's expertly crafted drinks were a highlight, bursting with flavor and creativity. But it was the exceptional service provided by Francisco, Marcos, and Javier that truly made our visit memorable. Their friendly demeanor and attention to detail ensured that every dish, especially the delicious pizza and seasonal vegetables, was a delight. Overall, with its welcoming atmosphere, delectable food, and top-notch service, this restaurant has secured a spot as one of our favorites!",5,2024,04,24
228,Unpleasant hotel stay,"My experience at this hotel was unfortunately marred by several issues. Upon checking my folio, I discovered I was wrongly charged for a no-show, resulting in an extra $426 fee. The front desk was not very helpful in resolving this, though they assured me it would be corrected. Another inconvenience was regarding breakfast—I was promised a free meal as a gold Hilton member, only to be told mid-meal that it wasn't included. This necessitated leaving my food, waiting in line, and speaking with customer service to rectify their mistake. By the time I returned, my meal was cold. These mishaps detracted from an otherwise potentially pleasant stay.  We stayed at the Morrison in Dublin which was fantastic.  We should have gone back and stayed there instead.",1,2024,04,24
228,Nice hotel - poor dining experiences,"We stayed at this hotel for a concert 22/4/24 we had a slight oversight with booking breakfast for 1 of the rooms so we paid for the added breakfast at reception on check in 
 The rooms are spacious clean quiet comfortable and warm beds and pillows very comfortable bathroom really clean with lovely classy crabtree and Evelyn products.
Dining however was a complete nightmare 
I ordered the burger on the menu; the menu  stated what was included on the burger (ballymaloe relish) I asked the waiter several times to confirm the burger did not contain mayonnaise (as I am allergic) he confirmed it didn’t. When the burger arrived (after quite a long time after ordering)  it contained mayonnaise but on top and underneath, luckily I checked before taking a bite, after making staff aware the meal was replaced and a free drink given however allergies are very serious and need to be taken seriously and not only could this blunder have made me very ill it also meant the delay with my meal caused my companions to have finished their meals, I had to eat mine on my own and very quickly so we didn’t miss the opening act of the concert which meant it was like an episode of man vs food eating as quick as I could. Staff need to be educated in allergies and how serious getting it wrong can be.
I felt very safe and comfortable in my room and I have no issues in terms of the room and facilities 
Now we come to breakfast 
We went to breakfast at 09:30 (breakfast is served until 10:00)
After ensuring both rooms had breakfast included on check in and paying for the extra room the breakfast server maintained there was only breakfast included for 1 room, to be honest I was so annoyed i was just going to leave as it was quite embarrassing as a queue started to form, after him making some phone calls we eventually we were permitted to enter. There was only hash browns and beans left available on the hot plate for the cooked breakfast and 4-6 people were waiting like Oliver Twist with his bowl asking please sir can I have some more for more cooked breakfast to be brought out all the while breakfast staff were seeing to themselves for their own breakfasts, now surely staff should wait for customers to be served before seeing to themselves? The bacon was evidently deep fried… I didn’t partake but once the rest of the cooked breakfast items were brought out it was very nice and was worth the wait.
The final straw for me was the way in which 2 members of what I can only assume were management cornered a member of cleaning staff in quite an intimidating manner right in front of us right at reception demanding to know why he didn’t clean behind a sofa, he was trying to explain to them there were customers sitting there and they scoffed at him he then proceeded to follow them asking for clarification and guidance and they spoke to the poor lad like utter trash and then walked off together like they were celebrating some kind of a win and the poor lad looked absolutely shell shocked and completely kicked in the guts! As a manager myself that IS NOT how you treat members of staff and how to achieve productivity and achieve the best performance from your team. They did not attempt to show him train him coach him or motivate him they just told him it wasn’t good enough and swanned off, we were absolutely disgusted, they may be management but they certainly need to learn people management skills.
I would give this hotel another chance but there are a lot of improvements needed.",3,2024,04,23
228,"Perfect for family and friends meeting , best location Dublin and nice people","The food was amazing, clean environment. Good for family or business meetings and I'll definitely visit more frequently. Every staff member is so welcoming. I'll definitely visit again with my other friends.",5,2024,04,18
228,A Convenient Stay,"Well located hotel. Modern amenities, wonderful breakfast. We were able to store our luggage there after check-out while we continued to visit. Bathrooms had bulk amenities and ample storage.

Staff was helpful.

Right off bus route for the Dublin Express.",5,2024,04,17
228,Great stay!!!,Our family had an awesome stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin. Great location right on the river and close to the middle of downtown. Staff was very kind and accommodating. Room was quiet and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was excellent too. We’ll definitely pass the good word about this hotel. We highly recommend staying here. Thanks!,5,2024,04,17
228,It’s ok,"It’s ok nice people , but should be bit updated I’ve stayed there twice and both rooms were old ich , also air condition it’s a bit too noisy. Cleanliness very good , breakfast decent can’t complain , gym and bar nice Overall short stay as for Dublin as said ok",4,2024,04,15
228,Brilliant,"Brilliant weekend stay at the hotel. The staff were really helpful and friendly. The location is decent too, with transport links nearby. It was our first time in Dublin and the staff were fantastic, giving tips and helpful information. The room was clean and spacious, with a good bathroom.",5,2024,04,14
228,Great customer service,"After a lengthy journey, we arrived at the restaurant late in the evening. Despite it being close to closing time, Alejandra, our waitress, welcomed us with a radiant smile. Her pleasant, kind, and professional demeanor truly brightened our day after the exhausting trip. And her recommendation for the seafood chowder was spot on. Thank you, Alejandra!",5,2024,04,13
228,Weak Customer Service,"Extremely weak customer service. Both the front desk and the restaurant staff do not seem interested in providing good customer service. The front desk has an arrogant attitude toward guests and are unwilling to answer questions thoroughly. For example,  I needed information regarding a pickup location for the airport shuttle. A man at reception was very unhelpful and gave me vague information. When I asked for clarification on what he said,  he informed me he didn't know how else to explain it. I would think answering this kind of question would be a core skill for assisting travelers. He seemed bothered by my questions. The restaurant staff is too busy socializing with each other to remember customer orders. I want to like this hotel but after my recent stay I will look for another ""go to"" hotel in Dublin. I'm paying too much per night for this type of service. Management needs to take an honest look at how the guests are treated. There were other strange service issues I experienced which all add up to a not good stay overall.",2,2024,04,10
228,Clean modern hotel,"Clean modern hotel. We stayed for a long weekend to celebrate my friends birthday. I emailed beforehand to let them know that it was my mates birthday and they were very kind to offer a complimentary upgrade ☺️
A little further out but peaceful area if you don’t mind a little walk into the town. Would definitely stay again",4,2024,03,31
228,Fantastic location that allows you to walk to just about everything in Dublin,"Very well run hotel. Staff is international and friendly. Cleaning of rooms is a little slow, but the rooms are very clean and comfortable. The bar service is extremely good. We could walk to everything we went to in Dublin. They were great on preserving a taxi for the airport.",4,2024,03,26
228,Great hotel! Kind staff! Super location!,Incredible service & beautiful hotel located near everything! Breakfast was fantastic and the rooms are very comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff were very helpful. We had problems setting up our att international and the receptionist help us … no questions asked!!,5,2024,03,23
228,Food is great,The beetroot and goat cheese salad is amazing!!!! Pamela is the best waitress we had her a few nights in a row and she is so attentive and very sweet!! We would eat here every night if we could stay forever! The hotel is very nice and breakfast in the morning is good too.,5,2024,03,16
228,Staff go the extra mile,"Very friendly and helpful staff, both at reception and even more so in the restaurant. Service in the restaurant was quick and the food was of good quality. The restaurant staff, Pamela, Christian and Francisco went the extra mile and took time to chat even when it was a busy period, making the whole dining experience relaxed and enjoyable after a hard days work. Would highly recommend for business trips or pleasure.",5,2024,03,16
228,Spoiled by the Hilton brand,"Great hotel in a fantastic location, just a few minutes walk along the Liffey, great service with easy check in / out. Would have been 5 stars but for a couple of issues with the room: 1: We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a riverview, so we did for €38 which would have been fine if our winds wasn't overlooking a building site between the river and the hotel! Shockingly poor tactics from the Hilton chain (never had these type of shadowy tactics when it was a Juries !! ) 

and 2:then our room had an adjoining door which was apparently made of tissue paper allowing us to hear the loud German speaking guest in that room ordering a taxi. 

Take a gamble on the Hilton trying to mislead you into paying more than standard for room next to a building site and finally avoid room 415",4,2024,03,15
228,lovely stay in dublin,"three night couple stay for pleasure, hilton gold; lovely stay at this property started with a pleasant check-in experience.  very spacious room with a comfy bed.  bathroom was a good size though the shower a bit small, relatively.  even though room was a bit warm, having the ability to open windows was nice.  located on a main road next to the river which is nice as lots of restaurants and shops nearby.  however, it is quite noisy especially with the windows open to provide relief from the warmth.  wonderful breakfast with great variety.  gym is on the small size and only lightly equipped.",4,2024,03,12
228,Would visit again but maybe a different room,"Room very small even for 2 people,bed quite creaky. Tv size okay but no Netflix or anything like that so no choice of things to watch on the normal TV. Heating a bit confusing to work ,would have been nice if instructions were left. Shower really not good at all as was hanging of the wall and stuck in one position so made washing whole body and hair difficult. WiFi good. Staff in restieraunt below quite rude and made guests feel uncomfortable as they were laughing at certain orders. Would stay again but not in this room and wouldn't go anywhere near the reateraunt downstairs.",3,2024,02,28
228,"First class hotel, staff friendly and food amazing","First class hotel. Very clean. Breakfast variety is amazing, something for everyone, loved the waffles. The food in restaurant also first class and the washed down with Dublin Guinness a must. 

We had room overlooking river which was nice. It was my friends very very suprise 60th birthday trip not knocking she was coming until a detour heading towards London turned into 3 nights in Dublin. She was treated to bubbly, strawberries, chocs and a card from the hotel which was a wonderful touch. 

Had lovely night sleeps, room spacious and bed comfy. 

We will certainly be back.",5,2024,02,21
228,Really good stay!,"Amazing hotel; really local to everything. The breakfast is AMAZING! we was in walking distance of everything. The staff are so so helpful, only down fall for us was the pillows were far too soft, made it quite an uncomfortable stay! Other than that such a beautiful clean hotel! Will stay again…. Just upgrade the pillows ha! Xx",5,2024,02,19
228,The place to stay for a guaranteed great time in Dublin.,"We booked the hotel back in Sept/Oct last year due to its locality to the centre of Dublin. There were 4 of us, 2 couples, and we were celebrating, so we wanted to be close enough to the centre to be able to walk there and back. We were able to check in early, thanks to the wonderful team on the front desk who put us into 2 fantastic rooms. We had room 707, it has the best views on the river, and great views of the illuminated bridges and city on a night. It was spacious, with a large walk in shower, iron/ironing board, hairdryer etc.
Its about a 20 minute walk from the Hilton to Temple Bar, where we started our days & nights out.
Thanks to the staff here, you really made us feel welcomed and comfortable, you are a credit to the Hilton brand. 
We will stay here again.",5,2024,02,12
228,Excellent hotel and staff,"Excellent service from the staff. The room was clean and tidy. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Was a great stay, we arrived early and was let unit out rooms.

228,Chef Dani,The location is perfect for accessing all tourist spots in Dublin .The staff are extremely helpful and professional.A special mention to Chef Dani who produced the most delicious omelettes which set us up for the day !

228,Delicious restaurant,"Had the great pleasure to dine at Oly’s within the Hilton and had an incredible dinner. Pamela took care of us and was so attentive and proactive. We loved the drinks and the desserts, and the menu offered great choices.

228,Liffy luxury ,"We came over to Dublin from Scotland for a pals birthday party .
Location was important ...a lot of the cheaper hotels were full ..and so we decided to up our game .
So glad we did ....this hotel may be big but it manages to retain a family feel about it .
The staff seemed happy to be there as we're we ! 
The breakfast was excellent and the room was perfect .. clean , new looking , and a real treat .
We are coming back for a concert in February so expect Mr Edwards to be re booking for another Dublin treat .
Thank so much ",5,2024,01,28

228,Dinner service,"I just wanted to say what an amazing job Alijanda did on our large dinner party. We arrived with a large tour group and she went above and beyond to help us. She served, was attentive throughout the meal and continued with cleaning up when everything was finished. She couldn’t have been more pleasant even with the amount of work she was doing!",5,2024,01,21
228,Good hotel,Good hotel. we were on a lads trip. We stayed one night it’s near the action.the hotel bar is a good size and the breakfast was good. We had a room with a pleasant view overlooking the river. It’s a 20min walk in a straight line to Temple Bar. I would stay again!,5,2024,01,20
228,On the north side of the river but quieter!,"Enjoyed the Hilton Garden Inn.  Great staff, very professional.  I ate many of my dinners there, something I almost never do, but it was great.  The security of the elevators was appreciated, as you had to use your room card to get into an elevator, a major plus.  The WiFi connectivity was great.  The bathrooms had two minor issues: tough to floss with the bathroom lights surrounding the mirror and the hot water was NOT so hot.  On the positive side, the room heat was very responsive.  If you want to stay in a hotel, read the reviews on TripAdvisor, those reviews brought me to the Hilton Garden Inn, and I would go back.  Thanks to all!",4,2024,01,15
228,"Great staff, great location","The desk was very helpful, the rooms were fantastic. Pamela Christian in the bar area made us feel welcome, and the dinner service was great! The hotel is along the river and close to shopping, tourist attractions and pubs.",5,2024,01,11

228,"Great Location, Friendly Staff","Spacious, clean rooms, and friendly staff! Great location for being near the city centre but still far enough away from the crowds/tourists. The bus stop directly in front of the hotel is where Dublin Express picks up to go to the airport. The breakfast was delicious with lots of options and food alternatives clearly marked. Lekhnath was very kind in helping me sort out my booking info! :) ",5,2024,01,06
228,Brilliant experience!,"An excellent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. A warm welcome on arrival. Staff were courteous and helpful. Location brilliant (especially if connecting to Airport using Dublin Express). Room superb. Breakfast has a great range. I also booked this hotel because there is Fitness Centre (albeit a small room,  but it has all one needs for a decent workout). Plus, there is a laundry room. I would recommend this hotel. Had a brilliant experience. ",5,2024,01,04
228,Top Breakfast,"Had a lovely stay over the Christmas break, staff were very attentive and helpful, room was perfect but the best part was definitely the breakfast. So much choice, freshly made omelettes, make your own waffles and warm scones. It was the nicest breakfast we’ve had in a long time. Location is perfect also, tram line close by, hop on bus outside the door and lovely views across town.",5,2024,01,03
228,Great friendly staff!,Big thank you to Amy T from Hilton Garden Inn Dublin for giving us a professional and friendly hand with modifying our stay after some challenges with changing our dates!! She went out of her way to make sure we got what we needed and we're looked after. Look forward to visiting in August! ,5,2024,01,03
228,Perfect Location! ,"Amazing location, lovely spacious, clean room, comfy pillows, and fantastic service. The hotel offers the perfect spot to walk to Grafton Street and surrounding Irish pubs and restaurants. Dinner and breakfast are of a very high standard. ",5,2024,01,03
228,"Fine place, great staff","We.had a lovely stay at Hilton in Dublin over Christmas. Nice room, good bed, everything neat and clean, with the only downside that we would have liked housekeeping to be a bit more attentive or coordinated. When we asked reception to have them stock up on paper, coffee,  water etc, all we'd had was one roll of toilet paper and nothing else.
Except for that all the staff were very nice and attentive, and especially the breakfast was great. The breakfast chef Neida was really sweet and service minded, always with a smile on her face. Don't.miss her omelets and waffles!",4,2023,12,27
228,Wonderful food and service ,"My daughter and I traveled here for Christmas. We enjoyed our stay. The best part was the service. Navas and Neida were so sweet. When I get the chance to come back to Dublin because of the service, I'll be staying here. This hotel was also a great location to everything. We didn't mind the walk. ",5,2023,12,26
228,Good Guinness!,"The bar is actually nice! I'd normally never choose to go to a hotel bar because I sometimes find them a bit soulless but it happened to be the most convenient option at the time. Orla poured me a perfect few Guinnesses, and the price is actually alright as well. So I'd actually go there again!",5,2023,12,18
228,The basics delivered well,"The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre is in a great location, with some rooms (such as mine) offering views over the Liffey, even if the windows were a little grimy on my stay. Rooms are typical for an HGI, with everything you need at the basic end of 4-star. As with all HGIs, a self-serve convenience store in the lobby offers essentials you may have forgotten, including slippers and water - all chargeable.

My bathroom had Crabtree and Evelyn amenities in small bottles, which I suspect have been switched for large bottles by now.

Oly's is the property's restaurant and bar, with a decent enough breakfast buffet and typical offerings at other meal times. There is no gym.",4,2023,12,09
228,Fantastic!,"The restaurant and were fantastic! Not at all what you would expect from a global chain. The food, the wine and the ambience were all so festive! And I really enjoyed the wonderful service, especially from Tugce!",5,2023,12,06
228,Great Location,Lovely hotel . Very clean and our room was spotless . Staff were really friendly and very helpful. Great location and we weren’t too far from O’Connell street.  We were able to check in a little earlier which was fantastic.,5,2023,12,04
228,Solid Choice,"Hotel is a good choice for tourist pursuits in Dublin. You are basically within walking distance of virtually anything you want to see. My only suggestion would be to ramp up the breakfast buffet. Since it is an extra charge its quality should meet that. Other than that issue, we felt the property was a good choice.",4,2023,12,02
228,"Beautiful hotel, really enjoyable stay! ","The staff and atmosphere was wonderful. They are so friendly and helpful, especially Pamela and Viraj who served us while we got food and drinks. The food is lovely. The rooms are perfect. Would love to stay again in the future, especially around Christmas! ",5,2023,12,01

We will come back for sure.",5,2023,11,29
228,Wonderful ,"Absolutely wonderful hotel, no faults at all. The staff were very warm and welcoming. Rooms were clean, comfortable and warm. Just a 20 minute walk from the centre of Dublin.

228,It was brilliant. Even during the riots 🚨👮🇮🇪,Excellent hotel. Nice and clean. Friendly staff. Didn’t eat there but a few beers. Very helpful staff. Offering to call taxis. Look after luggage. The whole lot. I wish the TVs could connect to Netflix or YouTube but apart from that the rooms were great.,5,2023,11,27
228,Comfortable hotel and excellent restaurant service!,"This is a really nice hotel and I especially liked the restaurant.  We ate there twice and were served by Pamela.  She's wonderful:  efficient; caring, really went out of her way and just took very good care of us!  Great hotel, too:  very comfortable and great location in the city center.  I highly recommend it!",5,2023,11,23
228,Just what I needed,"This was my favorite hotel I stayed at during my recent trip to Ireland. Right from the start walking into the space I felt welcomed, comfortable, and warm. The front desk staff were friendly and endured my lack of sleep and bedhead look I was rocking. I came straight to the hotel after my long day of flying. Gabriel at the front desk was kind, accommodating, and took my luggage so I could relax in the lobby while they worked on getting rooms ready.  The entire hotel was clean, modern, and welcoming. Once I got to my room, I was ecstatic. It was clean and had everything I needed. I instantly laid on the bed and was in heaven! The bed, bedding, and pillows was extremely comfortable. I stayed three nights and loved every day/night I was there. The breakfast was perfect with an amazing selection of items. The wait staff was amazing and took great care of everything.  I look forward to my next trip back to Dublin and will be staying here again. Hands down you won't be disappointed staying here! ",5,2023,11,22
228,Javier Rocks!,"Everything was great.  One thing was exceptional...our server Javier. He went above and beyond to accommodate our entire Globus party.  From explaining dishes, answering questions, and making helpful recommendations. He is truly an asset to your organization.  Thank you Javier from Roxanne & Patrick Hogan.",5,2023,11,22
228,First but not last.....,"Dublin is a city with many faces, where the old is very tastefully blended with the modern without loosing the Charme.Thanks to the high development Infrastruktur of taxi tram, Bus and train systems there is realy no need of a car rental the whole entire time of a vacation. Maybe only for special trips into the countryside. 
Alejandro from the Hilton Garden Inn made our trip complete with going the extra mile to make us comfortable. 

",5,2023,11,19
228,"Updated, comfortable, great location","Very comfortable room, walking distance to major sights and convention center. Very clean, and good breakfast. We tried the bar in the lobby with business colleagues and stayed longer than expected. Would come again. ",5,2023,11,18
228,72 hours in Dublin,"Fantastic stay at this hotel, close to the airport and we’ll situated in Dublin City which meant we could walk to most attractions and restaurants. Fantastic service by the team here especially Raina on the front desk who went out of her way to advise us of best places to enjoy all things Irish and Sam the following day who was super polite and helpful.
The hotel is clean, has a fabulous breakfast offerring and a pleasant lobby to sit and relax in.  100% recommend staying here if you visiting Dublin",5,2023,11,12
228,Amazing stay was so well looked after by reception Marta and Caitlin ,"OMG..OMG.. what truly special experience I had the privilege of experiencing to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.
As I had a very difficult time with regards to a family member being ill. But what I got from the staff is just incredibly kind.

228,great stay in a hotel,"My wife and I were guests in Hilton Hotel for few days in October 2023. I have to rate this trip very high and one of the reason is a great stay in a hotel. Location is very good, just 10 minutes from the centre of Dublin city. Rooms are very tidy and comfortable with all needed equipemnt. They were cleaned every day. It was quiet in the hotel and we were able to rest after all day ofsightseeing. Food in a restaurant is very tasty and everyone can find something for himself. We recomment staying in that hotel very much.
Best regards
Mariusz & Magda Z",5,2023,10,21
228,Excellent service from Orlagh,"First class service from Orlagh at the bar last night. Despite the bar being clearly understaffed she served everyone that arrived promptly and with a friendly smile.
She's clearly an asset to the team at the HGI Dublin and hope she's recognised as such! ",5,2023,10,21
228,Start as we mean to go on,"First Prosecco of the trip served by Javier has started our weekend away perfectly! Lovely service, fabulous city! Hotel room is perfect, and the added strawberry’s for our friends birthday was the perfect touch",5,2023,10,20
228,Excellent location and friendly staff,"We stayed in one night for celebrating our 15th anniversary and everything was fantastic. The room was spotless and better than our expectations. We had dinner in the restaurant which was delicious, that night we’ve served by Alexandra who was so kind and friendly. The breakfast was so good, plenty of options to have. That morning we were welcomed by Natalia who was so nice and kind with us. Thanks to all the staff. ",5,2023,10,18
228,Nice clean hotel,"Nice clean and comfortable hotel, short 10-15min walk from O’Connell St, nice enough during the day but a bit deserted at night so wouldn’t walk it alone, short taxi journey from Temple Bar. We were a family of 5 and managed to get adjoining rooms.",4,2023,10,16
228,Slippery tube,"Room smelled like mold, electric outlets not working, and front seat staff rude made a big deal and mentioned I had 1000 keys made for my room.  The shower in the restroom is unsafe I feel when getting out slipped. Manager was unable to make it right.",2,2023,10,15
228,Dublin hotel hospitality at its best!,"This hotel far exceeded our expectations.  After spending 8 days and 1100 miles on a bus tour around the entire country, we planned to decompress and stay an extra couple of days in Dublin.  HGI provided a great location on the River and attractions including the EPIC Museum were easy to walk to.  Clean, modern and comfortable rooms.  The staff at the front desk including Demi and Sarah were pleasant and helpful.  Alejandra and Pamela in the restaurant provided our most pleasant dining experiences on 2 different occasions, including securing my wife’s purse which was accidentally left in the restaurant. Alejandra immediately brought the purse to the front desk for safe keeping and we were called right away in our room that they had the purse.  Thank you Alejandra!  It is very apparent that this property has great management and the front line staff exudes hospitality.  We hope to come back again and if so, Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre will be our home!",5,2023,10,14
228,"Great hotel, great location, great staff","My stay at the hotel was simply spectacular, largely due to the excellent service provided by waiter Javier. From the moment I entered the hotel restaurant, Javier made sure that every one of my needs was attended to with a warm and genuine smile.
In addition to his impeccable service, Javier also stood out for his kindness and courtesy. He was always willing to listen to my concerns and provide suggestions about the best tourist spots to visit in the area. 

The rooms at Dublin Hotel were modern, spacious, and tastefully decorated. The comfortable beds and luxurious amenities made it difficult for me to leave the room each day. The cleanliness of the entire hotel, from the lobby to the rooms, was impressive and added to the overall sense of comfort and relaxation.

The hotel's location was another plus point. Situated in the heart of the city, it provided easy access to popular landmarks, shopping areas, and restaurants. Whether it was exploring the historic streets or experiencing the vibrant nightlife, everything was just a short walk or taxi ride away.",5,2023,10,11
228,Amazing Shower!!,"After traveling for 2 weeks and especially a 10 hour flight, the hotel was so welcoming and that shower was life changing! Great products available! Towels were extra large and super soft!! 
Nice view of the river. ",4,2023,10,10
228,A Good Choice in Dublin,"We chose this Hilton primarily because of the 5-min. cab ride from the cruise port and the availability of a guest laundry (4 euro/washer and 4 euro/dryer) after a 10-day cruise from Scotland.  The location is on the north/""quiet side"" of the river but a nice walk to most points of interest.  It is also just a short walk to get the Dubliner Express bus to the airport (20 mins away).

The room was comfortable.  As other reviews note, the staff are very pleasant and the breakfast is quite adequate.",4,2023,10,09
228,"Best Hotel In Dublin - Clean, Amazing Location, Friendly Staff & Well-Maintained","This hotel did EVERYTHING right. Demi at the front desk is the best display of Hospitality and represents her hotel and Dublin very well. This hotel is incredibly clean, well-maintained, rooms are modern and beautiful, breakfast/dinner/room service are all phenomenal. Fitness center was perfect. Location was central to all the local Dublin attractions. Very comfortable for leisure and business guests alike. Book here and you will be well-cared for and safe! Thanks Demi, and the team at HGI Dublin for the amazing experience!",5,2023,10,04
228,A+++ Experience,"The hotel was a short walk away from the main attractions. Best breakfast and friendly staff. From the minute we stepped into the Hotel, Dan the Manager was there to make sure that our every concern and needs were met. He went out of his way to make us comfortable.  We are definitely coming again and will tell all our friends and family to do the same.",5,2023,10,03
228,Good solid American style hotel ,"Very clean, well appointed smaller rooms.  Everything needed for a nice stay comfortable stay.  The breakfast, dinner and coffee bar are very consistently good and reasonably priced. On property guest laundry was ultra clean and super helpful!!  The area is a bit out of the way but felt safe.",4,2023,10,02
228,Great hotel for a Dublin visit!,"I stayed in this hotel and found it to be an enjoyable experience.  Of course it’s not cheap, but this is Dublin and all hotels are fairly expensive.  However, it is located well, the rooms feel modern, the staff very welcoming and it feels like great value for money!",5,2023,10,01
228,What a completely awful hotel in every way!,"We had just about one of our most disappointing hotel experience in a long time. The service was awful, breakfast just about the worst I have ever had in a hotel. Staff were at best clueless most barely spoke English.  If you asked for anything you waited for ages and were passed to others to try to get anywhere, so you ended up repeating yourself 3-4 times. Rooms wasn’t made up I spoke to 5 people before it was finally addressed at 4.30pm. The place was littered with dirty glasses, plates, bottles on every floor and this is meant to be a 4 star hotel! Will not be returning any ti e soon that is for sure. Totally spoilt what was meant to be a special occasion.",1,2023,09,30
228,Great for a short stay for older couples,"Great location. Easy to find from the ferry terminal. In a quiet location on the edge of the central area, but 5 minutes walk to lovely bars and restaurants. Temple bar and busier area is just a little bit further on. Lovely views over the river, helpful friendly staff. Easy to park next to the hotel, but not cheap.",5,2023,09,27
228,Love this spot.,Javier whom helped us with the dining area was terrific. Very helpful despite being very busy. Courteous and friendly. Made the stay even better. Clean hotel in a great location. Modern rooms were very clean. ,5,2023,09,26
228,Shamefull,Rude uninterested front desk staff. Your problem not mine. Bar closed at midnight. No room service. This is a business hotel … as informed by the night manager. Most unpleasant unfriendly person. Irish hospitality…. There was none…. It made me ashemed to be Irish. Being nice is easy …,1,2023,09,20
228,DO NOT STAY HERE.  THE A/C SHUTS OFF AT MIDNIGHT,"WARNING, the air conditioning automatically shuts off at midnight, and then every 3 hours after that.  

I checked in with my family and went to sleep the first night.  We all had an awful night's sleep because of the temperature and woke up sweating.  I called the front desk to alert them of the issue and they sent up the hotel engineer.  When he arrived, I explained the situation and was told that for energy conservation purposes, the air conditioning shuts off at midnight.

I spoke with the manager of the hotel who concurred that they shut off the A/C and he was barely apologetic saying “that’s the way it is”.  He offered me a desk fan!!.  Really?  I paid $600 per night for a three star hotel and for the rest of my stay, I had to wake up twice per night to reset the air conditioner so that my family could sleep comfortably. 

After my stay, the hotel sent a request for me to give a review and based upon my complaint this is exactly what the response that Alina, the Operations Manager sent back:  

“Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel. We sincerely appreciate your feedback and we are very sorry to hear that you were uncomfortable with the temperature of your guest room during your stay. The AC is programmed to turn off around 2 am in our intention to reduce our environmental impact, it can however be put back on just by pressing the ON/OFF button.”

I can't believe the audacity of a hotel that expect their guests to wake up at 2am to reset the A/C.  (And by the way, it shuts off again after another 3 hours. )

If they want to save electricity, why don't they shut off the air during the day when most guests are out of the hotel touring?

DO NOT STAY HERE.",1,2023,09,20
228,Great view,"Hilton app works wonders. Booked 24 hours ahead and got a great river view on the top floor, for a very fair price. Every thing looks new. Good beds. Great breakfast. Super location. Walk across the river to Temple area. ",5,2023,09,10
228,A perfectly nice place to stay,"We stayed for three nights August. It was a perfectly nice place. The staff was friendly, the room was clean, the beds and pillows were comfortable, the view was wonderful! I booked a twin room with points, but upgraded to a double queen room on a higher floor with a view of the river, which was well worth it! I was able to keep the window open during the day, but turned the A/C on at night, and it was super quiet. 
The breakfast was fine--not fabulous, but good, and again, the staff was super friendly! They had a little bit of everything, and offered gluten free and dairy substitutes, which if you need them, it's nice to have.
The location was okay. I mean, most of what you want to experience in Dublin is across the river and at least a 20 minute walk. There really weren't many options to eat or any great pubs nearby--you really needed to go across the river. But, at least it was nice and quiet when you got back to your room! There were bus stops right in front of the hotel, which was nice, although they seem to really just whiz by you--not sure if you are supposed to flag them down like a taxi! ",4,2023,09,08
228,"Clean, comfortable and modern in a great location.","Comfortable hotel on the river and with great access to most attractions in downtown Dublin.  Rooms were ample, comfortable, clean, quiet and well stocked.  Breakfast buffet was plentiful.  Parking garage for fee is right next to the hotel.  It’s a little spendy just as everything is in Dublin.",4,2023,09,07
228,Great Hotel ,"This was a lovely hotel on the river within walking distance to all sites. The staff was very friendly and welcoming!
The room was spacious and very comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay.
Thanks so much!",5,2023,09,07
228,Amazing Customer Service,This was a DELIGHTFUL experience and it was largely due to the staff. A young gal names Demi helped check us in and greeted us every morning. She was super helpful in telling us where to go and was gracious and lovely when I was too early for my room. I genuinely looked forward to seeing her in the morning and having a good laugh. THANK YOU to the staff!,5,2023,09,06
228,Very good👍,"Nice stay, clean rooms. Restaurant and reception staff were friendly and pleasant. Ankit at restaurant deserves a special shout-out for his very helpful and attentive nature. Will choose this place again to stay when I visit Dublin. ",5,2023,09,06
228,Perfect,This hotel lived up to all the expectations. It has an excellent location for walking around the tourist destinations and it’s right on the waterfront. The rooms were clean and updated. The staff was nice and the restaurant/bar on the bottom floor is really convenient. ,5,2023,09,04
228,Great location with good food!,"Beautifully maintained and appointed rooms. The restaurant, Oly’s  Bar and Grill has a current menu that is creative and taste delicious. But it was our server Alejandra with help from George who gave us excellent service. They were warm and friendly and very helpful.  Will definitely recommend when in Dublin.",5,2023,09,01
228,Good chain hotel experience,"This is a perfectly serviceable, well-located chain hotel. Comfy beds, clean rooms, great A/C, quiet hallways and a good buffet breakfast that included what you would expect from a Hilton Garden Inn. (The tub/shower drain didn't empty properly though, which was a bummer.) The staff was friendly, and they were kind enough to store our luggage when we arrived on an early flight until our room was ready. I'm docking a point because our quad room was extremely expensive, even by summertime-in-Dublin standards! ",4,2023,09,01
228,Excellent restaurant breakfast!,Had a great brunch - fresh omelettes and lots of fruit. Javier was a lovely host and Neido made the yummy omelets even though we arrived just as breakfast was ending! Both were lovely! Thanks for breakfast!,5,2023,08,21

Special mention to Neida who was very friendly and gave excellent service. My family thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast!,5,2023,08,18
228,Very good service,"Chambers are nice and spacious. The location is great and allows you to visit Dublin center on foot. There is room for improvement in term of products quality for breakfast: natural Orange juice and good expresso as an example. 
But the best part of the hotel is the service. In particular Javier was of great help when we had an incident during breakfast.",4,2023,08,18
228,Great location and friendly staff!,Great location. We walked everywhere and the airport bus is nearby. The breakfast was excellent and the service exceptional.  Special thanks to Ana and Natalia for their friendly service including the oven fresh scone!,5,2023,08,16
228,Special dietary help,"During our stay we had a very early morning bus tour to the Cliffs of Mohar. The front desk told me, we could have a breakfast to go bag made up for us if we gave them a days notice. One person in our party was gluten, wheat, and cow dairy free. Natalia (breakfast manager) and Neida (breakfast chef) were extremely helpful and awesome in getting a nice selection of breakfast food that was gluten, wheat, and cow dairy free! Our friend was very happy with her food selection! Thank you so much for the help Natalia and Neida!",5,2023,08,14
228,Perfect location!,"Just the perfect stay in Dublin! Can’t be more thankful for it. Excellent service, clean, spacious and comfortable rooms. Javier at the restaurant services make our meals even more enjoyable due to his professionalism, always willing to help and great recommendations. We will definitely come back! 
As a plus, the hop on hop stop is just outside the hotel, great way to know the city. ",5,2023,08,12
228,"Convenient location, wonderful staff... a great place to stay!","This hotel's location is very convenient! It was close walking distance to many sights, experiences, and restaurants. The staff was kind and attentive to travelers' needs. The hotel food, particularly breakfast, was excellent.

We requested a room at the rear of the building, to attempt to separate ourselves from the bustling town and nightlife. Our request was honored, and we did not experience any disturbances or noise pollution. The front desk was accommodating, friendly, and helpful. ",4,2023,08,10
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin-Great value for the Money,A terrific location close to key Dublin sights and great value for the money.  We stayed 5 nights after arriving Ireland and another on our way home.  Great staff including Demi at reception who made it easy to prebook our airport taxi.  Breakfast was included and appreciated.,5,2023,08,09
228,Good location - small room fine for a short stay,Nice location overlooking River Liffey. Easy walk along the river to O'Connell Bridge into the city and Temple Bar area. Parking garage adjacent but some steps to get your luggage into the rear hotel entrance area. 20 euros/day with hotel validation. Usual small room. Sink drain stopped up upon check-in and housekeeping or maintenance never had it repaired. Restaurants nearby - great Italian short walk away.,3,2023,08,09
228,Perfect city stay and food ,"The manager Elsa was very helpful.. Especially with all our dietary requirements.. jain food
So was most of the staff at the restaurant..
Hotel is conveniently located across the river.. short walk from the city center..
Had a nice time..
Would stay again if in the city..",5,2023,08,08
228,Noisy place,"Very noisy place. Bedroom was above linen delivery which was 6 am and bin collection in evening, meal cabbage head fried terrible and steak was ok. Rooms small cannot put 2 bags open, bed springy. Staff mixed helpful and disinterested.
Bar drinks ok but Prosecco put in glass was flat as glass was dirty.
Not a nice area Ireland not nice.",2,2023,08,08
228,Great Location; Helpful Staff,"Located on the North Bank of the River Liffey, the Hilton Garden Inn was a perfect place to stay during our whirlwind tour of Dublin. Staff were extremely helpful; the rooms were clean and comfortable and Oly’s for breakfast was excellent. ",5,2023,08,07
228,Memorable City Break,"I chose this Hotel because of its proximity to the Convention Centre.  I was attending a 4 day Soroptimist International Convention at the CC and wanted accommodation within a short walking distance.  This hotel was ideal for me.  My husband accompanied me but did not attend the Convention. He said it was ideal for walking by the river, going into town and picking up the Tour buses.  The room was comfortable and had the large bed and walk in shower I had requested.  The reception staff were excellent and our first trip to Dublin started very well with the welcoming smiles from the staff. Demi in particular  went the extra mile for us. She helped with our luggage and chatted in the lift.  She listened to what we said about our reasons for being in Dublin. We later found a delightful card and box of chocolate to celebrate our Anniversary break.  How thoughtful was that?  She also responded to our request for Taxis and recommended restaurants.  Sorry I was ill on the last day and did not get to eat at The Church.  I would love to return to Dublin and would certainly choose this hotel.  Thank you all for a memorable stay!  Shirley Hallam Gould",5,2023,08,07
228,Breakfast al Hilton Dublin,"Javier from the restaurant at Hilton Garden Inn Custom House was very kind and helpful with breakfast… Everything we needed he was there to help us.

228,Simply the best!!,I have to say the best part of stay was out wonderful waiter Marcos. He catered to our needs.  He made our stay simply perfection. So very friendly. SUPER PROFESSIONAL We will recommend this hotel to all-our friends and family.  THANK SO MUCH FOR HIRING HIM !!!!!! Best waiter ever,5,2023,07,31
228,"Good location, Good Breakfast","The hotel is in a good location and the room was clean.  The water pressure in the shower was weak.  There was a bathtub in my room, so I had to step into it and the tub was a little slippery.  

Since I went in the summer time, daylight lasts from 5:00 am to 10:00 pm.  I had to meet a tour bus at 6:30 am and the women at the reception told me it was safe to walk around as long as you stay on the big streets.  I did feel safe walking to the meeting point about 15 minutes away.  

As a diamond member, I received free breakfast during my stay.  The breakfast here was very good with full English breakfast items.  They have coffee machines that make lattes and cappuccinos.  

The hotel is convenient to the bus stops that go to Dublin airport.  

Overall, I enjoyed my stay here.  ",4,2023,07,26
228,An unforgettable experience,"Best of the Best!!⭐️

As soon as we walked in we were greeted with the most welcoming greeting by all of the staff who really show they care for all of the guests that walk in the door. They upgraded our room completely free of charge!! The food in the restaurant was nice and so was the breakfast. A big shoutout to Demi on the reception desk who went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and knew our way around Dublin. She was so attentive to whatever we needed..  She truly made our stay an unforgettable holiday. Cannot wait to visit again!!! 👏🏻",5,2023,07,25
228,Overall Great Hotel,"Our family of 4 stayed at this hotel for six nights. The location is pretty good - only about a 10-minute walk from O’Connell Street.  The rooms were nicely appointed, modern, very clean, and the a/c worked very, very well.  We opted to have breakfast at the hotel daily and it was pretty good (among other things, they have fresh eggs, an omelet station and a waffle station). We had lunch once and dinner several times at Oly’s Restaurant and we were highly satisfied with the food and service each time.  Our only complaint - and it’s a big one - is about the beds. The mattresses were very, very hard and we could hear AND FEEL the bed coils every time we moved, even the slightest bit. After the 2nd or 3rd night, I learned to prop my body with 3 pillows to get some rest (shouldn’t have had to do this). We complained about it at the front desk but nothing was done to resolve it.  Hopefully, not all the beds at this hotel are this uncomfortable. Had it not been for the beds, I’d give the Hilton Garden Inn 5 stars. ",4,2023,07,23
228,Great staff- Good food!,"Our server, Pamela, was very sweet and friendly. She was attentive and communicated the status of our dinner order with just the perfect timing. She made our dining experience T Oly’s very comfortable and enjoyable! She was great throughout our stay!",5,2023,07,22
228,"Lovely hotel, ideal for a weekend get away. ","Lovely hotel in nice area on the water. If you’re happy to walk into main city to reach bars, shops and restaurants this hotel is ideal. 

Friendly staff, clean and modern.

Bargain weekend away! Would recommend 

",5,2023,07,21
228,Very nice family hotel. Excellent location and great service.,"We have had a short but very pleasant stay at this property. It is located next to the river and close to everything. We had great service from the front desk and at breakfast, specially from Javier who was great making sure we had everything we needed at all times. Great job!",5,2023,07,21
228,Lovely stay,"Every member of staff was so friendly and helpful, room was clean and comfortable - could not pick a single fault with our stay! Requested a bucket of ice to the room and it was brought to us quickly and happily which was appreciated :) we checked in a bit early & were allowed to check out a bit late which was needed after a night in Dublin when our flight wasn’t until 9pm - highly recommend was super pleased!!",5,2023,07,21
228,Amazing kitchen chef," Very good experience- Amazing service from the kitchen workers especially from Neida the breakfast chef who gave me a personal treatment and you can really see that she cares so much about the guest. 
",5,2023,07,19
228,Best of the Best,"I can’t thank you all enough for your kindness and excellent service.  Your Hotel has become my second home for the last year and a half because of my job.  The staff is always so welcoming at check in, and it’s always great to see Viraj in the restaurant.  He always takes a moment to say hello and makes an effort to make all feel special and welcome.  Thank you!",5,2023,07,17
228,"Smooth, easy and convenient","Everything about this hotel was smooth and easy. They stored our bags for us, we were able to freshen up in the large lobby bathrooms, breakfast was great, rooms clean/quiet and the location was ideal. Great for a quick stay in Dublin. Highly recommend.",5,2023,07,15
228,Great breakfast!,"Myself and my wife went here for breakfast today and we had an amazing experience, we had the omelette severed by chef Neida who was really welcoming and helpful. I would highly recommend to all of my friends and family.",5,2023,07,13
228,Good home base in Dublin,"Serviceable hotel along the River Liffey. Walking distance to many attractions including Temple Bar, Trinity College, and St Stephen's Green, as well as several popular day tour pick up points. Many restaurants, cafes, and pubs nearby. Our room was clean but the bed was a bit small and creaky. No issues with the bathroom. Hot showers any time of day. There is a bar/restaurant on the ground level serving breakfast & dinner. ",4,2023,07,12
228,"Great service, food at hotel restaurant","The food at Oly’s is fresh, and beautifully prepared. Be sure to try the leek soup and chicken butter tikka. Service with Alejandra is phenomenal. If you don’t believe in hotel food let Oly’s change your mind.",5,2023,07,11
228,"Nice, clean hotel. Convenient location.",Stayed for two nights and had a good experience. Alejandra in the restaurant Oly’s was great. Took us in right before closing and gave us great service with a smile. Will come back again next time we are in Dublin. ,5,2023,07,09
228,great for everything but food.,"This hotel is located on the better side of Dublin, and is within walking distance of lots to see, do, and eat. It was also nice to park our car in the garage behind the hotel, get a discount for said car park, and be able to walk everywhere. Staff was friendly, and the room was nice. We also had good views of Dublin. Those are the positives. On the other hand, the hotel breakfast is abysmal, the food is either gross, bland, or not allergen-friendly. If you are looking for good breakfast, go to Bewley's in South Dublin. ",4,2023,07,08
228,Extended Visit in Ireland,"The Hilton located in the outer ring of Dublin, downtown, was clean and comfortable, with rooms conducive to quite sleep time.  The staff was helpful, and breakfast can be purchased in their dining area each morning.  Most of Dublin's activities are in City Center, which was quite a walk from the hotel, so a taxi ride would be advisable.  You can then walk back and stop along the way.  Overall, a good experience, if you like to see the city side of Ireland.  We toured the countryside before reaching Dublin, so I would highly recommend that.  ",5,2023,07,07
228,Manager was awful and condescending about a bereavement,"Booked two rooms for my first visit to Ireland. Two members of the family suffered a bereavement and couldn’t make the trip. On arrival I informed the front desk to be told we had only booked one room which was incorrect. I then went back and showed the manager my booking confirming I had booked 2 rooms, I explained the situation to then be spoken to really rudely. The manager said the bereavement was not his problem and if the hotel allowed refunds for everyone then what would happen. I explained someone had died it was not an everyday event, he said it wasn’t his concern and told me even if I wrote a review of my experience it wouldn’t mean nothing to him. I am highly disappointed and 700 pounds out of pocket. More than anything I was disappointed at the service considering it’s a well known hotel. Do not book here if you wish to be treated well.",1,2023,07,05
228,Poorly run,"I’ve stayed at this hotel a dozen times as it’s super handy for walking into the city centre but I have to flag that it’s not a well run hotel - the attrition in reception staff must be high as it’s never the same people working there but the biggest issue is that the room is rarely available at check in - despite check in being 3pm I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been asked to wait.
What’s particularly annoying is that no time frame is offered “could he 10 minutes, could be an hour and a half”. Excuse me? The website says check in is 3pm and you’re telling me to wait until 5pm??!
Clearly management of the hotel is poor and housekeeping is either understaffed or under appreciated.
Either way - think twice if you book this place expecting to have your afternoon plans intact.",2,2023,07,02
228,Good hotel,"Booked my parents for anniversary to Dublin. They stayed in a river view King Room. They loved everything about the room. Great view, good AC, comfortable beds/pillows

Walkable distance to few sights and public transport stops",5,2023,06,29
228,Two night stay ,two night stay while on a globus tour. Appreciated the hotel had laundry available for guests. Breakfast is easy and fast.  Bar was good in the evening.  well located to see the sights of Dublin.  The beds were hard.  pretty typical hilton experience ,5,2023,06,27
228,Nice Stay except for issue with room ,"We were happy with our stay. Hotel is nice enough, breakfast was delicious - the most amazing coffee and raisin scones! The hotel is a little far removed from some sights but we enjoy walking and taxis were easy to find. No complaints except for our check in. We arrived early in the day and were told to come back later as our room was not ready, which we expected. We had reserved two connecting rooms and when we arrived the woman at the front desk confirmed that we were getting two connecting rooms. We went sight-seeing and then returned to check in to our rooms. It was long day, we were so happy to finally be in the room and to rest our feet and unpack. After we had unpacked and settled in we realized the rooms were not connecting. At that point we were too exhausted to move but it was very disappointing that after checking and double checking on connecting rooms, after they confirmed that it what we were getting.....they put us in non connecting rooms. Lesson learned, to check for that as soon as we get into room.",4,2023,06,25
228,Terrible front desk service,"We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre twice in June 2023 for a total of 4 nights. 

The first stay check-in experience was awful, the front-desk service as a whole lacked professionalism and politeness. We arrived early (11:00 am) and was told that room will be ready at official check-in time i.e. 3 pm so we came back at 2:50 pm and were told that room will be ready in few minutes and for the next 50 minutes room was still not ready and reception staff kept ignoring my reminders (4 reminders) and never got back to me with any updates on room status!
Finally, when I got upset and demanded to see the manager, one of the reception desk staff was upset and told me that check-in time starts at 3 pm and that room was not guaranteed to be available at 3 pm! As soon as they called the supervisor from the back, I was told the room is ready and was given the key!

The room was clean, but I found a drop of blood on the bathroom floor, it was immediately cleaned after I reported it by the housekeeper.

The pillows are of poor quality, and you can feel the springs of the mattress the minute you sit on it. Defiantly not Hilton quality! 

The shower water flow was very bad, I have been to many hotels with water saving shower heads but here it's terrible. 

The second time check-in was smooth, but room had same issues, poor quality mattress and low flow shower.

The positive side of the stay was the great hotel location, being on the river close walking distance to city center with many restaurants, cafes, and supermarkets nearby. Also, the AC kept the room cool on warm days.

There are normally 2 taxis in from of the hotel, and hotel is close to the tram lines, bus, and train.

The next time I visit Dublin, I will not be staying at the Hilton.

228,Helpful to the max at the HGI Dublin City Center,"•	Hugely successful 5-night stay! Coordinated over email and phone prior to stay with amazingly helpful staff and enjoyed wonderful personable staff during the stay. Thank you to Sales Manager Carol for upgrading us to a beautiful river view room. Restaurant increased their hours making available 6:30am breakfasts and late dinners on return from our day trips. Breakfast buffet was delicious! Enjoyed chatting many mornings with housekeeper Barbara from Spain. Guest laundry room was helpful too.
•	Well located! On hotel side of the Liffey and walking distance was nearby ATM, Fresh Grocery Store, interesting Jeanne Johnston Ship, eye-opening O’Connell Street Risings history sites, beautiful Hugh Lane Modern Art Gallery, secrets tour at Jameson Distillery and delightful Celtic Nights Dinner Show. Walked a few minutes across the bridge to Trinity College, National Gallery and Archeological Museums and Temple Bar district Be certain to see the bog people at the Archeological Museum. And, take home Jameson Whiskey not available in your country, like Jameson Crested.
•	Also took tour through historicaltours dot ie. 
•	And two one-day day trips with Wild Rovers Tours dot com. One day to Wild Atlantic Way for the Bunratty Castle, Cliffs of Moher, Burren National Park and Galway. Second day to Northern Ireland for Belfast and Black Cab Tour, Giants Causeway, Dun Luce Castle and Monasterboice Monastic Site. Wild Rovers drivers were safe, smooth and knowledgeable. 
FULLY RECOMMEND and hope you too enjoy the HGI Dublin.

228,Average hotel experience,Average hotel experience. Checkin was delayed by over an hour. The checkin staff was passive aggressive. When waiting in the lobby an additional 5 guest were also delayed since the hotel wasn’t able to plan accordingly for how busy it was going to be. ,3,2023,06,15
228,Nothing special.,"The Queen deluxe room with river views sounds better than it actually was. The bed had mattresses that when sat upon the springs creaked. 
The room was clean as was the bathroom but the typical size and decor of the usual room found in other hotels that I have stayed in while in Dublin, for half the cost. The breakfast is extra and again there was nothing special - the same thing was served everyday - most of which was mediocre and little variety with the fruit. There are also some concerns with the condition of the neighborhood that you pass through on a ten minute walk to O'Connell Street. All in all very disappointed. If you have allergies the heavily perfumed lobby will leave you possibly struggling to breathe. There was a lovely person at the front desk who checked us in but even the front desk service as a whole was nothing special and lacked the friendliness that I have experienced in other Dublin hotels.",3,2023,06,13
228,Nice Hotel in a Great Location,"This is a very nice hotel with a great location. Most of Dublin is within walking distance. My room was very pleasant and comfortable. Housekeeping does a good job, the room was very clean. The breakfast is also very good, with plenty of choices. 
Rania at the front desk checked me in and out. She is great, alway very pleasant and helpful. She is a delight to deal with.",5,2023,06,12
228,"Great breakfast, especially Chef Neida!","I was in a very short work trip this june and found the hotel to be very clean and comfortable with modern amenities. What really stood out though, was how courteous the staff were, particularly Neida the breakfast chef, who not only cooked up a great omelette, but was very friendly and caring of the guests.",5,2023,06,07
228,Good way to start a trip,We found the Hilton Garden Inn City Center comfortable and a good start to our two days in Dublin before setting off on our own adventure through Ireland. We ordered room service and it was delicious. The bed left something to be desired but we were completely exhausted and slept decently well regardless. We would stay here again.,4,2023,06,06
228,Good hotel choice,"Check In and Check Out were great experiences due to the excellent customer desk staff, especially Rania.  We stayed before and after a one week tour, and Rania remembered us when we returned!  She had also given us an excellent restaurant recommendation on our first visit.

The rooms were fairly comfortable, although the pillows in the room we had on the second visit could use replacing. The bathrooms could have both used better cleaning before our arrival. The first had a long hair stuck to the door (longer and darker than mine) and someone’s toenail was on the floor of the second room.",4,2023,06,05
228,Fantastic city break,"We stayed as a group of 8 on a city break to Dublin. The hotel is in a fantastic location, its immaculately clean and the team can't do enough for you. We ate in the Restaurant twice and the food was incredible so a big shout out to the Chef. 

We'll definitely be back to Dublin and this is absolutely the place to book. ",5,2023,06,04
228,Dublin City Center Hotel,I would like to highly recommend this Hilton in Dublin. Outstanding location. Spacious and clean rooms.  But most of all the 3 female front desk staff. I had their names written down but I have misplaced it. I am so disappointed !!! If the hotel could look up the morning staff at the front desk on May 3rd. 2023 please acknowledge them for being so professional and efficient the morning I checked in and all their recommendations during my stay !,5,2023,06,03
228,Lovely hotel in a great location,"This was my second time staying in this hotel and I had an excellent time. Dublin is a lovely city with great people, and the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. The room was clean and the bed comfortable, with free wifi and a mini fridge. The hotel also has a laundry room, this is very convenient and not an amenity that I typically see in hotels, but extremely helpful for visitors. ",5,2023,06,01
228,Amazing Hotel,Great stay for the bank holiday with the family visiting Ireland for the first time we will see you soon such an amazing city even my three boys enjoyed it and they didn’t even get bored the hotel was very nice and just as you expect from the Hilton and I have stayed in a lot of them.,5,2023,06,01
228,Great location!,I was very impressed with the staff; they were very accommodating! The front desk took the time to go over the map and show us food places we were looking to visit. This really helped especially since there were so many to choose. The food and service was also great! Highly recommend!  ,5,2023,05,29
228,Great service and good local information,"The service was excellent. We also got Rita over information to visit all the places. Thank you very much for your professionalism. Cristian, Agneska and Viraje Great job keep up the good work see you guys soon. Thank you..",5,2023,05,24
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin May 10/11th 2023 ,"A very nice, modern and clean hotel with nice staff and a good location over the Liffey river from the city centre. The rooms are comfortable with plenty of charging points, comfy bed and home comforts. I stayed here on business with my job so I didn’t have enough time to completely review it but I was very impressed with my experience of some 14 hours or so.
Breakfast is a must-have and a great start to the day. The chef makes fantastic omelettes and a good Irish breakfast - with black AND white pudding - is superb. There are equally excellent healthy breakfast options to be had if you prefer. I was most impressed with Agnes who took the trouble to recognise me as a Gold member and who coordinates the restaurant extremely efficiently- my thanks to her.
All the staff are indeed very friendly and approachable. The girls on reception can’t do enough to help you and are always cheerful, even under pressure.
There is a small fitness room that I utilised which I wasn’t expecting to use but it was extremely functional with free weights and aerobic machines.
Hopefully my next stay here with my wife/family/friends will be a bit longer next time as I really liked it - thank you to all the staff and see you soon for a long weekend!

228,"Older business hotel, a bit overpriced and in need of updates.","Ouddated Business hotel, good bed, small bathroom, no separate shower (only in bath), breakfast OK, but choices rather limited and offering not attracted be enough. Too expensive (235€ per night, group tariff) for the offered quality. Too bad",3,2023,05,14
228,A great hotel on The River Liffey,"Pros:This hotel had everything that was really important to us.. Great location, speedy elevators, good in house restaurant ( and the breakfast was quite good for a buffet),kind staff. An employee there named John was very help to us when we needed help finding things around town. The front desk staff were very nice and patient with us. 
Con:the only thing I noticed was the mattresses are not as plush as the US Hiltons (in my opinion).
Overall a great experience.

228,It matters where you stay. ,"Great location on the edge of the city center. Close to several tram and bus lines that get you to major tourist sites. Nice, modern property with clean, comfortable rooms. It's the people who make this a great hotel though. From the front desk to housekeeping to the restaurant staff (especially nuestro amigo, Alex), you'll feel welcome and well cared for.",5,2023,05,12
228,Nice hotel in a great location,First the location is fantastic and right in the city centre. We were in town for a concert and found it the perfect hotel for getting around the city. The breakfast buffet was very good and well stocked. The restaurant staff worked extremely hard to turn tables and keep the food stocked.  The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful.  Rania was so lovely and helpful.   ,5,2023,05,11
228,Great hotel for a Dublin visit,"The helpful staff here made it a welcome first stop when we arrived in Dublin after a long flight. Rania in particular was very conscientious in securing our luggage until our room was available. She also enabled us to check into our room early, which was a relief to us weary travelers.

The breakfast buffet is extensive, and the dinner at the hotel's restaurant was delicious and beautifully presented. 

This hotel is a great home base when visiting Dublin! ",5,2023,05,09
228,Outstanding property!! Highly recommended. ,"This hotel sets the gold standard for all mid-range Hilton properties. The rooms are large, pleasant, well-appointed, and clean. The employees are all really kind, inviting, and accommodating, and they went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. The breakfast buffet included a wide variety of classic options as well as meats, cheeses, pastries, made-to-order omelettes, waffles, fruits, coffee, and juices. The property is one block from the local light-rail railway line, making access to the rest of the city simple and convenient. I would highly suggest this property and will most certainly stay here again if I return to Dublin.",5,2023,05,07
228,Quiet location in the center of Dublin,"Quiet location close to the convention center and Dublin Express drop-off, but still less than 10 minutes from all the bars and activity of Temple Bar.

228,Lizi was great!,Excellent service at Oly’s.  The coffee machine was broken and Lizi took care of our caffeine needs. She was very attentive overall. The breakfast waffles were delicious (in lieu of maple syrup they’re served with honey and Nutella). Thanks so much Lizi!,5,2023,05,05

228,Lovely hotel,"Really lovely hotel - perfect for what we needed. Literally on a bus stop, walkable into central Dublin within 20 mins, fab bar open until midnight, really delicious buffet breakfast, clean and tidy room and kind staff. No complaints here! Only not 5 stars because this obviously isn't a luxurious hotel but it's more than acceptable considering the price.",4,2023,05,04
228,Restaurant staff,"One day we were a little late for breakfast (unknowingly) and they were all so helpful and welcoming, especially Neida who continuously asked us if we needed anything extra. They brought us out everything possible even though they were in the process of cleaning up. It was greatly appreciated and nice of them to do (which they didn't have to!)",5,2023,05,03

228,"Great location, AWESOME staff!","Spent 7 nights at this centrally located hotel. It was our home base from which we took a few tours through out the country. The rooms were spotless, the beds were very comfy and they have washers and dryers for guest use.

The front desk staff, especially Sara, were extremely friendly and helpful whether they were helping us with directions, reserving us cars or recommending restaurants. 

The staff at Oly's were the best! Every night we came in we got a warm welcome and great service from Kenneth, Alexandria, Miriam, Mar, and Steffani. They were such a great group of people that really enhanced our stay.

There was also a very nice breakfast buffet which came in very handy!

Would stay here again!

",5,2023,04,30
228,"Good location, traffic noise though!","I stayed here for 3 nights whilst on a work trip having never tried it before.
Location is great, fairly central and a short walk to the office but the one draw back was traffic noise.  I was on the first floor and from 5am busses and lorries passing the hotel could be heard very loudly.
The room and hotel itself are decent but the one draw back is pillows and it goes for every Hilton I stay in just having sub par pillows on the bed!
Service was OK at front desk, breakfast and the bar.  I didn’t eat here apart from breakfast and the options for that are relative to Hilton’s usual affair.
I’d give it another go but would request a room not facing the road!",3,2023,04,27

Close to city centre and to buses to the airport and other transport

Breakfast as pretty classic but the staff is super nice and charming, especially Neida at the omelette station

228,Excellent Hotel to Stay in,"Overall Experience was great, except parking is subsidized for a single entry to 20 Euros/day so keep that in mind if you want to come & go several times it will be very expensive, 4.50 Euros/Hr. Breakfast is to die for, Cannot beat it. Clean rooms, Noiseless, Great Staff. As a diamond member i did get an upgrade but I am suppose to get 2 water bottles free every day but they kept forgetting that, other then that everything was excellent. Will definitely come back.",5,2023,04,20

228,Couldn't have been a better hotel!!! Would stay here again!,"We arrived to Dublin earlier than check in, pulled our car into the parking garage with no problems. Front desk was very accomodating since our rooms were ready mid-day.

There was a couple of minor issues with housekeeping/room service however it was resolved quickly. Must say what really stood out was how kind and helpful all the staff are here, especially at reception, which makes for a very welcoming stay all round and we would definitely come back.",4,2023,04,15
228,"Great location, view  and outstanding customer service dedicated to make your stay comfortable","Great location in closer proximity and often within walkable distance from many restaurants and tourist attractions/railway station and bus stop/tram stop makes this location very attractive with the fantastic view of the river.
The service of employees and managers from the front desk to the restaurant is commendable with their every attempt to make your stay comfortable. They work with the same enthusiasm whether you approach them early morning at 6 AM or late evening at 10 PM. This dedication to service from booking the reservation until check-in and check-out makes this hotel stand out compared to other Hilton hotels. I will recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Dublin as a Diamond Member.",5,2023,04,15
228,Great hotel & location - not so great restaurant experience,"The hotel is approx. 7 mins walk from Connelly Station and about the same from the bus station. It is in a good location to explore the city, about 15-20 mins walk from Grafton St and 15 mins walk from the Bord Gais Theatre. We didn’t drive so I don’t know the options for parking, there is definitely no parking lot around the perimeter of the hotel. Check in was good, Emily checking us in was so friendly & helpful. 

I had a double queen room which was although wasn’t big was a nice size with comfy chair, work table, flat screen tv, tea & coffee making facilities, small fridge, safe, wardrobe and full length mirror. Wi-Fi was good throughout the hotel. The bathroom was compact in that you had to fully open the door and walk around it to get to the toilet. There wasn’t a lot of room around the sink for toiletries, but there was an extra shelf to put things on. The shower was a bath shower and it had good pressure. The lighting was also good. The hairdryer was located in the drawer in the wardrobe which meant that you could use it wherever you wanted in the room, which I love. There was also USB charging points beside the bed and at the work table .

I’ve stayed in many Hilton Garden Inns before and this bed was a little more firm than the others, but it was still comfortable. My room was on the 1st floor and over looked the front of the hotel which was on a busy road, you could hear the traffic and some voices from people walking below but I was still able to get a good night sleep.

I didn’t use the gym in the hotel, but I did see that it had a good selection of equipment eg 2 treadmills, bike, cross trainer and free weights 

The hotel has a restaurant and bar where we had dinner )Ollys),  I was actually really disappointed by the food and service in the restaurant for dinner. I ordered the Chicken Supreme, which was basically chicken with mashed potatoes & veg and a jus. The restaurant wasn’t busy but we did wait a while for the food (which I don’t mind as it gives confidence that it is cooked to order). I am not that fussy with food, but when it arrived was cold, the chicken was barely lukewarm, the mashed potatoes were hardly warm and the 2 long thin carrots and the kale were cold. I sent the food back and the waiter disappeared for going on 10 minutes, at no time did anyone come over to apologise or tell me what was happening, my companions had got their chicken tiika curry and were eating away, there’s was fine. When my food came back, the chicken was warmer, but the potatoes were actually the same as before – barely lukewarm, the kale & carrots weren’t cold but you couldn’t describe them as warm and the carrots were replaced with ones that were barely 2 cms long and the jus had disappeared. I was hungry at that stage and my friends had finished their food so I ate it, but again no-one came over to check with me if everything was OK. When we were all finished our empty plates sat for at least 25 mins before anyone came over to take them away and no-one asked us if we wanted dessert or coffee – again the restaurant wasn’t that busy and there was a number of waiting staff wandering about !!

In comparison though, the breakfast we had in the morning was great. The hostess was friendly and efficient & the food was lovely. It was a typical buffet breakfast with different options of bread to toast, fruit, yogurt, hot eggs, bacon, sausages, tea & coffee etc….. There was also the added extra of omelettes made to order as well as a self service waffle area

Overall this hotel is in a great location if visiting Dublin, the room and facilities were good, the majority of the staff were lovely, the housekeeping staff all made sure to say hello and smile as I passed by which was lovely, but the food in the restaurant needs to improve and the wait staff needs a refresher in customer service

228,Very warm and welcoming family/city hotel,"This was a short Easter break in Dublin, Ireland for a family of 3. We had an amazing and exciting time. Really memorable. As this was our third stay at the hotel, I must unambiguously and unreservedly admit that the entire reception (Front Desk) team were very nice, polite, helpful, pleasant and most importantly very professional especially Rania, Sarah, Dan and the Asian lady supervisor/Mgr on duty on Easter Sunday 9th April 2023 who demonstrated absolute discretion and professionalism as we were upgraded from a Twin to Family room as our room wasn't ready when we arrived and was in fact taking longer than expected. In addition, the housekeeping team were also very pleasant and lest I forget, the very beautiful and of course generous breakfast buffet..Will most definitely recommend this pleasant family/city hotel anytime.",5,2023,04,14
228,Relaxing Stay,"Great Hotel! Emily on reception was very helpful. We had a room overlooking the river. And as it was my partners 60th Birthday we were given complimentary drinks on Oly's. The Hotel is very central, nothing is too far away. The breakfast is a must.",4,2023,04,12
228,"Great Breakfast, Away from Tourist Areas","The hotel is clean and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. We were a little far from the main tourist area (15-20 minute walk). Rooms were adequate. We had a king room and a room for the kids (doubles). They can’t give rooms like this on the same floor, so we were on different floors. 
The tub is high, so if you have any mobility issues make the hotel aware as it was even difficult for us to get in and out without slipping and we have no joint issues. 
Breakfast was good. Fresh coffee, amazing biscuits, buffet, and omelette station were available. So try the biscuits- amazing!!! 
There is a stop for the train behind the hotel to get down to the main areas if needed. We always walked along the River.",4,2023,04,10
228,"Great view from room, ideally located in downtown Dublin, outstanding customer service should make this hotel as ideal","Excellent service by every member (Yassine, Georgi, Julie, Sara, Rivant , Christian, etc,) of the team from front desk to restaurant . Great location in closer proximity to many touristic attractions and tasty renowned well rated restaurants and bars. I shall recommend this hotel as the customer’s comfort is the hotel management’s topmost priority .The quality of service is consistently good during 6 days of stay. Good breakfast buffet, drinks , dinner menus offer additional benefits of staying within the hotel at the start or finish of a busy day.",5,2023,04,10
228,Not comfortable and secure,"The breakfast was ok, room was ok but not comfortable, I had an issue of security during my stay in the room. Duty manager reached to me very well but still not any solutions. Hotel located in a center place",2,2023,04,07
228,Exceptional Stay - Tremendous Staff,"What an incredible stay! It is centrally located, a short walk from all the highlights, and a staff that focuses on customer-care. A super stars we were lucky enough to be assisted by was Faiza. Faiza is professional and dedicated, and makes a difference. ",5,2023,04,06
228,Well-appointed comfortable hotel right in the heart of Dublin.,"Hotel personnel were friendly and helpful every time. Room was comfortable with amenities such as safe, refrigerator, complimentary bottled water, hair dryer, and comfortable bed/pillows. Situated in the heart of Dublin, Hilton Garden Inn was central to everything. Walking distance to several must-sees with easily available taxis for the further sights. Our breakfast buffet had everything we could ask for except brewed decaf coffee. The eggs and toast were my favorites.",5,2023,04,06
228,Great stay.,Wonderful stay in a comfortable hotel with easy access to the city center. Best part was was the fantastic Irish breakfast and Neida’s delicious omelet was a real treat. She was so pleasant and welcoming each morning. ,5,2023,04,06
228,Outstanding in all departments,"Well trained staff in all departments. About a 20 euro taxi ride to airport through tunnel. Located in office area but close to train station, some visitor attractions and hop on buses. About 30 minute walk to Temple Bar area. Not many restaurants close by but hotel restaurant is very good for breakfast and dinner. ",5,2023,04,05
228,Excellent location,The hotel was in an excellent location for exploring the city. The hotel was really nice our room had a good view of The Liffey. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had a problem with our room which was dealt with quickly by the team. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel on our Kat morning which had a good selection to choose from.,5,2023,04,02
228,Great hotel!  Lovely staff.,"We stayed here for 6 nights at the end of March.  On our first night there was an issue regarding the bed in our room.  We went to reception where we tried to get situation rectified.  We waited in reception while staff tried to solve problem.  Our problems were solved as soon as Georgi (duty manager) took on to resolve situation himself.   Not only did he solve the problem that night he also upgraded our room for the next five nights and gave us vouchers for a meal and drinks in the restaurant.  We cannot give him enough praise for dealing with our problem.  He is an absolute asset to this hotel!  We loved our time in Dublin and our time in this hotel and would definitely recommend a visit here.  
Thank you Georgi, they are very lucky to have you!",5,2023,04,02
228,5 STARS!!! Fantastic experience!,"5 STARS!!!! My family had the BEST experience staying at the Hilton Garden Inn! The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating! The breakfast buffet was delicious and fresh! Must try the scones and traditional Irish breakfast items! The restaurant bartenders were also fantastic! Our room was super clean with a great view of the river! Garage parking was a breeze; easy access which can be quite difficult in City Center. Pay for parking at check-in, makes life easier! An extra special THANK YOU to Faiza, at the receptionist desk, who went above and behind to make our son feel extra special! I can’t say enough good things about this hotel! Perfect location!",5,2023,03,31
228,Close to shopping!,"Stayed here the first and last night of my trip.  A very clean hotel within walking distance of O'Connel Street for shopping and pubs.  The room was on the small size but had everything you would need.  The towels were absolutely wonderful.  Oversize bath towels and really soft and fluffy.  The desk clerks were very friendly and helpful.  The bathroom door opened right against the toilet so you had to walk around the door to get to it.  Kind of a pain but not a big problem.  The last  night when I pulled the comforter down to go to bed I noticed the sheet was wet!  Luckily there were two beds in the room and the other bed was okay to sleep in.  (The room was a little small for two beds.)  Never had a wet sheet before.  Not much counter space in the bathroom, however, there were two shelves to compensate.",3,2023,03,26
228,Oly's restaurant... Amazing breakfast,"Oly's restaurant? ABSOLUTELY.

we stopped in for an easy breakfast and were blown away at the assortment and the quality.

The omelettes, made fresh to order, were DELICIOUS! and I'm not sure how to describe the waffles but they were so light, airy and delicious.

Best breakfast of our 11 day road trip",5,2023,03,26
228,Will Be Back ! ☘️,We had a great stay here while in Dublin! Hotel is within 20 mins walk for all that you need to see.  Hilton Garden was clean with plenty of lobby space and the staff were great.  Shoutout to Ujjwal at Oly’s who went out of his way to help me with some toast for someone in my party that was under the weather.  Will definitely stay here next time we visit!,5,2023,03,26
228,Dublin experience ,"The room was wonderful, right in the middle of everything we wanted to do. The breakfast was so large you couldn't sample it all, so we made a point to have dinner here as well. The hotel is right next to the Epic museum. The first place I wanted to go.",5,2023,03,20
228,Excellent ,"Food excellent! Staff excellent! Rooms clean and excellent! Finshe did an excellent job! Excellent location! Will return! We were with a tour group and this hotel really dis a super job with everything
  All we had to do was ask if we needed anything. ",5,2023,03,20
228,Hopless food service from a leading hotel chain,"Shockingly bad and inept service from the Hilton chain. Ordered food 45 minutes ago at 10:50 pm only to be told 40 minutes, later that there was no chef, so nobody in the hotel could cook frozen chips or prepare the food we ordered some 40 minutes earlier. 

This is not a Travelodge, it is a Hilton at £440  per night. I felt like I was in an episode of Fawlty Towers and trying to order a Waldorf salad. Basil Fawlty's excuses were more plausible than what the staff offered. Is the war still on? Hopeless from a leading hotel chain.",1,2023,03,17
228,Clean hotel,"Visited here for a overnight stay. We checked in on the app the night before however when we arrived at about 2:45pm the next day we were told the room wasn’t ready, which was fine we were aware we were early and got told to go back at 3pm. We did and still was told the room wasn’t ready, we then waited until 3:45pm and went back and the lady behind the desk (the 3rd person we’d spoken to) and she couldn’t find the room for us, the manager then came over and offered us drink vouchers while he tried to sort it, after another 30 minutes we were told they had no room and we were instead offered a suite- our main issue with this was the fact that the first 2 people we spoke to at reception just told us the room wasn’t ready rather than just saying what had happened and trying to sort it out in the first place. The hotel was clean but busy. The next day when we needed to get to the airport the staff behind the desk were quite rude and just told us to wait outside to see if a taxi would come rather than ringing us one (which they did do with other guests). Overall a nice hotel but not up to the usual hilton standards that usually have  friendly staff and are very organised.",4,2023,03,17
228,A nightmare,"This hotel is a disaster.
If you like to sleep on the ground in the open air, go to this hotel.
If you dislike to wash yourself, go to this hotel.
If you dislike to take a breakfast in the morning, go to this hotel.
The last sentence I heard from the desk is that I wasn’t allowed to communicate with the Director.",1,2023,03,16
228,Great Location!,"This hotel was very clean, and in a great location. We were very close to the city center, and could see the bridge from the front of the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were close enough to everything we did to quickly run in and change clothes/ drop bags.",4,2023,03,15
228,Great stay in Dublin,"Loved the week that we spent at the Hilton Garden Inn.  The rooms were well appointed, immaculate and quiet.  The staff throughout the hotel were so gracious and welcoming.  This was our first visit to Dublin and the front desk staff went out of their way to offer suggestions and assistance.  We also enjoyed the lovely restaurant for breakfast every morning and for a couple of dinners.  Every meal was delicious and the service was excellent.",5,2023,03,14
228,Massively overpriced 1 star hotel,"Checkin took 45 mins after being told they could not find my booking despite providing a booking reference. 

The room was clean but the pillows were extremely uncomfortable and I barely slept. The towels were very rough give the cost of the room. The air didn’t work properly. The breakfast is literally the worse I have had in any hotel.  Takes effort to mess up this bad. ",1,2023,03,13
228,Great Hilton experience,"We stayed here for two nights in August 2022 with some friends.  The hotel is nicely decorated with a very light and airy feeling.  Our room was at the back of the hotel which was very quiet.  The rooms are nicely decorated, have everything you need(safe, ironing board, iron, TV, fridge).  The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean and new. It’s a little bit out of town which we liked,right on the river Liffey.  It’s is a 2 minute walk from George’s Dock tram stop, which is an easy way to explore Dublin.  To walk to the main areas such as O’Connell Street, Trinity College, Temple-bar is 15-20 mins. Solid hotel from Hilton",5,2023,03,10
228,Great Stay.  Highly recommend,Called a week before as I was arriving in the morning and had booked the night before.  Spoke with Alex and he arranged everything.  Check in with Emily was smooth and cheerful.  Very helpful and she provided a guide to the area.  Great team at this hotel and I don’t want to forget housekeeping.  The room was very clean.  Great stay and would stay again.  Highly recommend this hotel if you are in Dublin.  Easy walking distance to places or get a leap card and take public transportation.,5,2023,03,10
228,Great view of the river,Great experience good room with river view. Location is amazing. The front desk people is awesome. Breakfast is awesome with plenty of food but a little small space when there is to many guest as of for weekends. Completely allergen free room and great amenities.,4,2023,03,09
228,Amazing costumer service especially “Stefani”,"End up eating at the hotel witch rarely do and I Had a super nice dinner and experience Stefani was taking care of my table, 5 stars couldn’t have had a better time.  Thank you so much and definitely look for Stefani she will make you feel at home. 

P. Lopes",5,2023,03,04
228,Delicious lunch.,"About 20 of us attended a meeting and ate lunch in the restaurant. I had dietary requirements and was left perplexed when the vegan option for the day was off the menu. However, a young waiter called Alex couldn't have been more helpful and even brought out the dinner menu to me to see if I could order something from that instead. I had the cauliflower steaks and I have to say they were delicious. Their marinade was very tasty and the squirts of flavour alongside  - possibly tahini-based - were sensational. I'm grateful to Alex for saving the day. The restaurant is well laid out and bright and airy but the staff seemed overworked and there were issues afterwards with splitting the bill. If these organisational issues were ironed out, I would give 5 stars.",4,2023,03,03
228,WONDERFUL STAY,Our stay was absolutely wonderful and the attention of Alex and Valentina was super great. We felt like home. Definitely we’ll be coming back. The breakfast buffet was delicious with whatever you want to eat. Super great. ,5,2023,02,27
228,An all round lovely experience. Helped massively by Stefani.,"An all round good experience but I'd like to commend Stefani, while we were eating at the bar she provided excellent service. She was friendly, talkative and more than happy to help with any inquiries we had. Lovely lady and very helpful.",5,2023,02,22
228,Lovely For First Time Visit,"Visiting Dublin for the first time was made a better experience given the wonderful service and comfortable environment encountered here. Breakfast has a wonderful selection of food and includes the standard English breakfast. While dining we were looked after by a wonderful lady from my own country, Brazil. Stefani was kind and very attentive. Always checking up on us and making sure our drinks were full.

When returning, I will most definitely be staying here again. Lovely staff and great atmosphere.",5,2023,02,22
228,Returning to Dublin,"2nd time back to this hotel and lovely to see the renovations have gone well. 
Little disappointed on the menu choices that are available in Oly’s as they aren’t as exciting as it was several years ago. 
Thank you so so so much for letting us check in early. We arrived to the hotel at 9am and both rooms were ready. We were extremely exhausted from traveling all night and it was such a relief to be able to rest straight away. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, the A/c heating works great and we made use of the mini fridge in the room. We dined twice in Olys and I just wanted to say a massive thankyou to Stefani? Brazilian lady on the Monday 20th and Tuesday night  21st Feb. She was delightful, checked back and also made sure we were never low on our drinks absolutely impeccable service. Thank you 😊",5,2023,02,21
228,"Hotel is clean, rooms too small & beds are absolutely awful!","Hotel is lovely, rooms are very small for 3 people… it’s 2 slightly bigger than single beds. The beds are atrocious so uncomfortable iv never stayed in beds like it, wouldn’t believe how much it can affect a trip. Very clean & lobby is lovely with a little shop. Breakfast choices where very good. I would stay again for the cleanliness but would not for the beds… so uncomfortable!",3,2023,02,15
228,Ireland v France 6 nations.,"Spent the weekend  10 to 12 feb for the 6 nations match Irelend v France.

One small problem out of four coffee machines only one or two were working. I fully recommend this hotel.",5,2023,02,13
228,Highly recommend,"A great hotel. Good location with all major attractions within 5-15 minutes walk, easy access to public transportation. Rooms are very comfortable with all reasonable amenities. Super friendly staff. Our particular thanks to Faiza at the front desk and Alejandro at the restaurant. ",5,2023,02,12
228,Great location. Welcoming hospitality.,"Helpful front desk staff with travel needs. Outstanding breakfast buffet. Enjoyed the Dinner meals and deserts. Especially recommend the excellent service. Thanks to Daniel, Uiva, Keneth, Stefani, & Pamela. ",5,2023,02,10
228,Good choice!,"First time in Dublin, beautiful city, perfectly served (although a bit expensive). Large hotel with comfortable and ultra-quiet, spacious rooms, new furnishings, good cleaning. Situated along the bank of the River Liffey with a JEANIE JOHNSTON Tall Ship/Museum moored opposite. Convenient for transfers from/to the airport with bus stop 747/757 in front of the hotel. It is about 10 minutes walk from the city center (trinity college / dublin castle / The spire / ha'penny bridge / The Temple bar / and many others ...) next to the hotel you will find EPIC multi-ethnic cultural center, and its George's dock stop (Luas station) that in half an hour by tram you are at the Guinness Storehouse (Fatima stop and 5 min on foot), or you can visit the truly impressive Kilmainham Goal prison. First experience after three years of trying, definitely to be done again.",4,2023,02,10
228,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights as a little weekend getaway. 
Definitely made the right choice for accommodation, the hotel was modern, clean and quiet (considering its city centre.)
The food was also beautiful and the staff were great, really friendly! 
We would definitely recommend the Hilton Garden Inn- Dublin.",5,2023,02,08
228,Excellent Hotel,"This is a great Hotel ! Clean spacious rooms and everything you need for a weekend break. Breakfast was really good and service in the restaurant excellent.
Central location and short walk to main centre! 
Would definitely book here again!",5,2023,02,08
228,Excellent hotel - would go back,"We were very impressed with this hotel.
It was very clean throughout. 
The bedrooms were spacious, very clean and very quiet despite facing the street/river.
Breakfast was great. Very extensive buffet (including a waffle maker and omelets made to order!)
Service was very friendly.
",5,2023,02,05
228,Excellent Customer Service!,"We have stayed at this hotel several times now and each time it doesn’t disappoint for customer service. Had a slight issue with our room location on the first night this time however this was swiftly sorted by Martha on reception who not only remembered us from when we stayed for Ed Sheeran in April but made sure we were relocated to our preferred part of the hotel (quieter higher floor) and went to the trouble of showing me a couple of rooms so I could pick which one to move to so big thank you to Martha as that was really appreciated!!
Special mention to the bar staff who are all lovely and remember your room and preferred drink (Viraj) and also to Stefani who was really sweet and brought us the best brownie (highly recommend the brownie btw).
Thanks to all staff at the Hilton Garden Inn, we will of course be back! ",5,2023,02,03
228,100% recommended,"Everything was fantastic! Lovely staff! Sara in the reception was so kind to us. Also, the food recommendation of Viraj was delicious! This is a great hotel with amazing views to Liffey River. What's more, the Irish weather was not so bad. I'll come back.",5,2023,02,03
228,Nice hotel for good price,We stayed one night here but really enjoyed it. Nice and clean rooms and modern decor. Lovely reception area with good stocked shop and staff were pleasant. The only thing was the mattress wasn’t very comfortable. But blacked out rooms and no external noise.,4,2023,01,30
228,Perfect hotel ,"Excellent hotel with very good value for money.  Very good breakfast, facilities in perfect condition and very attentive staff, highlighting Eduardo who treated us excellently in the restaurant.  The hotel is a 10-minute walk from the main attractions and monuments and there is a bus stop to the airport very close.  Totally recommended.",5,2023,01,29
228,Lovely central hotel,Had such a lovely experience. Alexandra and Myriam at the bar are so lovely and made us the nicest drinks 😊 best expresso martinis in Dublin. Lovely and friendly girls who were very efficient and got us our drinks in a timely manner and we were so chatty,5,2023,01,29
228,"Great accommodations, location and wonderful client experience",Great accommodations and a wonderful location to explore a city to be walked to feel the pulse of this fabulous city. And a special shout out to Ourania at the front desk.  She was immensely helpful to me providing me with directions and looking after matters ensuring I received a great client experience with every interaction.,5,2023,01,27
228,Nice but noisy room. Breakfast unacceptable.,"Room clean and in good condition.  Plumbing however; regular loud noise of running water in the bathroom pipes throughout the stay.  
My biggest bugbear Breakfast, you simply do not charge guests for a breakfast - in Ireland - and not have a full offering - bacon anyone? - on offer whether that’s one hour before breakfast stops or 1minute before breakfast stops.  That is completely mind boggling to me.  Spoken to hotel front desk who in fairness offered to resolve, which I declined, it shouldn’t happen.  If that’s deemed acceptable I’m calling the management out on it. It’s simply not good enough.",3,2023,01,27
228,Great experience at the restaurant,"I got a fantastic and lovely service from Myriam at the bar. The restaurant looks very nice and comfortable and the food was delicious, specially the chicken wings and the sweet potato fries. I totally recommend it.",5,2023,01,23
228,Poor Dining Service,"Everything was ok but the dining experience took a lot away from our time there. Very poor service. On checking in we were looking for a bite to eat, found ourselves waiting to be seated at an almost empty restaurant for 10 mins. Staff members looking over from back of restaurant and continuing to ignore us. Next day we ignored sign and sat ourselves down, made staff aware and then waited about 25 mins for a menu. Ordered coffee at the end which came out with no spoons, sugar or milk. Couldn't be bothered trying to get a staff members attention. Too busy pretending to look busy. ",2,2023,01,23
228,Great stay!,"On the Eastern edge of Dublin, but in a great location and walking distance to most everything.  A kilometer or less from Temple Bar, Dublin Castle, Trinity Square, shopping on O'Connell Street Lower, etc.  Although not all in the same direction.  :)
Everything you would expect from a HGI and more.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The restaurant (breakfast and dinner) were very good.",5,2023,01,17
228,Excellent service - second to none.,"I must say I received the best customer service I have ever received in my life. Ana and Mayah were fantastic. Excellent attention detail, extremely welcoming and always happy to help. These two young women are a credit to the hotel. You truly are lucky to have them as members of staff.",5,2023,01,16
228,This is regarding the restaurant Olys,"We arrived cold, tired and very hungry. We were the only people in the restaurant as it was only 4 pm. The choices are somewhat limited so I thought to go with a pizza which is usually a safe bet. I questioned our server as I did not know the ingredient “Nduja”. He assured me it was a kind of mushroom, ground so I ordered the pizza. It arrived, looking nothing like mushroom. The pan was very oily so I thought it was perhaps sun dried tomatoes. Then I started eating. Wow, it was spicy. Back in our room, it’s not sitting well with me so I googled it. Imagine my shock to learn that it is, in fact, spicy spreadable pork sausage made using meat from the head and roasted Calabrian chili peppers. When in doubt, ask. I did. Our server did not.",2,2023,01,09
228,"Nice Accommodations, Location, and Staff","Our family lodged here for our annual Family Christmas Holiday vacay. The accommodations were nice, rooms were comfortable, clean, and well maintained.  The restaurant and bar were reasonable and selections were sufficient for those days when our external dining options were limited by planned activities or holiday business closures. The staff were very friendly, approachable, and made extra efforts to accommodate our requests during our stay.  The management personally checked in on us during our stay to make sure our accommodation and service expectations were being met. The hotel location was optimal to allow us to explore many nearby sites on foot and lift/taxi service was very easy to obtain from this hotel at any time. The hotel was very peaceful and we had no noise disturbances from external or internal sources.  This is very important to me as I suffer from insomnia and often times when visiting hotels have trouble falling asleep and then when I finally do I am awakened by noisy guests or outside street sounds.  Not the case here, I was able to sleep very soundly and uninterrupted once asleep.  Don't know if I should chalk that up to very calm guests during our stay, a calm and quiet city, or the hotel rooms being quite soundproof.  Whatever, the reason I so appreciated this with our packed daily schedule that often started before 6am and ending late into the evening.  If you are looking for reasonable and comfortable accommodations with great service and location, you should consider this location.",4,2023,01,03
228,Below average,"Poor breakfast. Sausage cheap quality. Tasteless. Bacon poor. General food quality poor.
Room AC was poor. Kept illuminating the whole room when on
Mattress poor and not comfortable
I paid for the best king deluxe room in the hotel and it was nothing more than a standard room
Pillows flat
Shower pressure terrible
Just could not get temperature set in room and was cold most of night. 
Worst was having to pay for dental kit €2. To be fair they waived it but did not expect to be asked to pay to brush my teeth! So bring your toothbrush and toothpaste!

And cause I used booking.com to book I could not get my points to keep my Hilton membership active. 

Poor Hilton",1,2022,12,16
228,Very bad service,The double bed was more like a single and a half. The restaurant menu is limited. The service was slow and very poor. The staff appeared to be relatively new. While sitting there I observed 3 people return their pints which were badly poured.,2,2022,12,10
228,ONE OF THE BEST HOTEL,"The staff was very friendly, and the room was impeccably clean.
Thank you for your excellent hospitality!
The front desk staff making me feel so welcome.
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who plans to visit Dublin.
I WILL COMEBACK AGAIN 😊",5,2022,12,09
228,Perfect stay,"The location couldn't have been better for sightseeing. Next door to the Epic Immigration Museum. Right on the River.
Hotel was beautiful and immaculate. Loved the bar/lounge area for chilling in. 
Staff were incredibly helpful and friendly both on the bar/lounge and also the reception. 

Room was spacious and comfortable. I was so grateful that the room was ready early for me - that made a huge difference. 

Would highly recommend and happily stay again!",5,2022,12,08
228,Great location and pleasant hotel,"Great location for access to temple bar. The hotel is quite nice but just lacked in a couple of areas. The bed was comfortable, the rooms were clean and the staff quite friendly. We tried the breakfast and a little disappointed that we could not have the Costa coffee as part of the meal. The sausage was not to our taste if we were to be picky. Located a local café in town and preferred there in comparison. All in all a lovely hotel and wouldn’t mind visiting again.",4,2022,12,03
228,A great stay!,"We were very pleased with our very pleasant stay at  the hotel.  The service was first class.

Room service has vastly improved compared to last year. Breakfast was good even if the staff didn’t manage to to top up the food and tea bags - ir was a bit frustrating.  The waiter gathered dirty plates and scraped the contents into one plate in front of our noses.  Another waiter gathered only cutlery and leant over our table to gather the used knives and forks. Otherwise a great stay and we will return!!",5,2022,11,27
228,my very good experience ,"The atencion was perfect, in particular in the breakfast, the personal were very kind and attentive.
The room was very comfortable and clean, it had a great heating and the complements (tea…) were very nice.",5,2022,11,22
228,Very nice,I stayed here 3 nights.  My room had a view of the River Liffey and the Samuel Beckett Bridge. I heard virtually no noise from outside so kudos for that.    I liked the walk in shower but there was very low water pressure and the water temperature was barely lukewarm at the hottest setting.  The bed was really comfortable and the room itself is large with lots of charging outlets.  The location is great and easily walkable to many parts of the city.  I also liked the artwork of scenes from Dublin.,4,2022,11,20
228,Family Trip for 3 Arena & Shopping,"We had two fabulous rooms, it was a family trip, we used the bar & restaurant and these were very good and food was excellent. Parking was easy and checking in was seem less. For shopping the location was great also.",5,2022,11,18
228,Not a great experience at all!,"During the check-in, I requested dock/river side view. The individual acknowledged and confirmed the availability but unfortunately ended up offering some other room. Okay that's fine!! 

At night, garbage truck disturbed my sleep on multiple occasions. Plus, there was noise from other rooms too.

The rooms are claustrophobic and looking at the standard of Hilton, atleast please consider offering water bottles to the guest.

I have stayed in Hilton at various locations but unfortunately the services were not impressive at all. I didn't find enough toiletries and toothbrush and paste. I'm not sure if I'm being demanding but this is something which you can expect at every Hilton. Moreover, I tried calling reception multiple times but unfortunately no luck. 

This was my business travel and would certainly share this experience with my colleagues. Not happy with the overall experience.",2,2022,10,30
228,Great Location,"Had a lovely overnight stay here last night.
The hotel is perfectly situated for sightseeing etc. Our room was so comfortable and overlooking the river.
The bar and restaurant are very busy but it functions with plenty of staff in attendance.
It's a quiet hotel  not a noise from outside or inside could be heard in our room.
It's spotless, modern and staff are so mannerly and professional.
The reception staff are the stand out memory, they could not have been more helpful and friendly.
Parking was easy, next door in fact. ",5,2022,10,30
228,Professional and attentive front desk staff !,"Great hotel with a museum next door! . Short walk to other local attractions and shops , clean rooms that are well equipped.Comfortable bed .
Friendly and attentive staff especially at the front desk who made check in and check out swift and efficient.",5,2022,10,27
228,Great location and value.,"Wonderful hotel.  The location is great as it is right on the river.  In fact, two of the places that one might want to visit are right out the door: the ship Jeanie Johnston (The Irish famine story) and EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum.  Also, the hotel is on a stop for one of the hop on hop off buses.  
For the hotel itself:  wonderful staff, good breakfast, very clean, and comfortable beds.  One slightly negative thing is that the showers are very small.
We will definitely stay here again and will recommend this hotel to our friends.",4,2022,10,26
228,Fabulous Hotel,Hotel was lovely. Staff were very friendly. Food and bar were great. Bedrooms were spotless and beds were very comfy. Will be staying again. A great location to the 3Arena. Very busy hotel that's always a good sign.,5,2022,10,24
228,"Nice hotel, horrible bar","Check in staff was great.  Had two bad experiences at the hotel bar.  Monday night I was the only person at the bar.  Three bartenders looking at there phones.  Lazy crappy service.  Wednesday night decide to give them another chance, bartender charges me double.   When I bring it to her attention she yells at me and says they don't overcharge people.   I hold up my receipt and say obviously you do.  She yelled at me and slammed my change down.  Giving me six euros of change in 20 cent euros.  Avoid the bar!!!!",3,2022,10,22
228,Thanks Marina and chef Alex,"We arrived at 8am after 24 hours without sleep. Luckily as we  walked in, we were greeted by Marina who found a room for us a little earlier so we could have some rest. I would also like to mention chef Alex in the morning, a very positive and nice guy. Btw as we are staying a lot at Hilton properties, breakfast here is really nice in general.",5,2022,10,17
228,Lovely stay,"Amazing staff, beautiful view in front of the river. Thank you marina from reception for your assistance in check inn, thank you chef Alex for the best omelette throughout my stay. 
Comfortable rooms, Best breakfast. ",5,2022,10,17
228,"Nice property, Good rooms","Nice property, easy check-in, we stayed on our way to fly back to Canada. Lovely staff, just the room had a bad odour, but that was rectified by the Housekeeping team. I will come back for sure. 
Thanks Hilton",5,2022,10,08
228,Hilton Garden Inn,Front desk help always friendly and helpful.   Breakfast buffet solid value lots of options.  Bar service was sketchy at best.  Bartenders playing  on phones and ignoring customers.   Bathroom bathtub extremely narrow.   Great location,4,2022,10,05
228,Perfect,"We stayed for two nights September 2022, as part of a GloBus tour.
Nice room, Had Aircin, safe, fridge.
Everything perfect.
Good breakfast.
Nice river outlook near a hark shaped suspension bridge.
Within walking didtance of Dublin main shopping street.",4,2022,10,04
228,Wonderful modern hotel for our family vacation,"Our family just stayed at this hotel a week ago and we were extremely satisfied with our choice.  The location was perfect for us as the view of the River Liffey was beautiful.  The room was modern, clean and spacious for our family and beds were comfortable.  All staff members were very kind and helpful to our family.  The walk into city center is an wash 15 minutes, give or take depending on where you are headed.  We didn’t mind as we enjoyed the area outside and view of the river with some great food options nearby.  My only complaint was service for dinner at Oly’s one evening that we chose to dine in.  Food was great but our server was slow.  We didn’t experience that when ordering some take out other days.  We would definitely recommend and choose to stay at this hotel again should they opportunity present itself.  ",5,2022,10,04
228,Great hotel in a convenient location,Great hotel with spacious rooms in a convenient location. Easy to walk everywhere and close to the main attractions and bridges. The bar/restaurant in the lobby has some good options and is worth a visit too. Competitively priced. Front desk staff were helpful and accommodating.,5,2022,09,27
228,Maybe it was a bad day or two?,"Sorry to say but I was rather disappointed with reception team. Asked few questions on arrival and at the departures ie. Dublin airport express times and stops and they were unable to help me on each occasion. Perhaps new team/overworked? not their fault, I know.. but if you are looking for helpful and knowledgeable staff.. ask Siri and google will tell you more. Rooms and facilities were clean, but our room was not set for 3 people sharing: towels, cups, coffee etc all for 2. Had to ask for extra cup every morning to bring it up to the room, while grabbing extra towels from housekeeping trolley on the way back. Again, not a big deal.. but I had bigger expectations from Hilton, especially when paying premium rates :(",3,2022,09,20
228,Amazing diner,"I had great dinner with mi girlfriend 
We enjoy the food (chicken and lamb) and drinks 
Thanks Alejandro and Christian for the great attendance and joyful attitude 
Definitely would come back and highly recomendable",5,2022,09,19
228,Best Staff Ever!!!,"I got covid before checking into this hotel.  When I informed them, they did everything they could to help me and make my stay as comfortable as possible.  I have never felt better taken care of than while I was at this hotel.  ",5,2022,09,19
228,A lovely Family Hotel with great reception team.,"We're a family of 3. We had a 3 night stay which was really exciting and fun filled as the hotel's minutes from the city centre. From check-in to check-out, the reception team were simply brilliant especially Dan. 

We'll definitely come back again!",5,2022,09,11
228,Fabulous hotel in fabulous location. Friendly staff.,"We stayed here 4 nts. Lovely breakfast including omelets to order and espresso drinks (the latter at ad additional cost). Vegan options. Dan at the front desk was particularly helpful, courteous, and professional. We utilized the computer in the lobby as well as the laundry facilities. Located RIGHT ON THE RIVER LIFFEY, within walking distance to Trinity College, Temple Bar area, Grafton St, and The Celt. And near a tram stop. Hostess at breakfast was very friendly and remembered us each morning, same w/ barista. Nice lobby bar as well although we didn't take advantage.",5,2022,09,03
228,Aoife Ahern,"We stayed with our large party for 5 nights and we had a wonderful experience. Reservations were all remand prepared for our arrival. The bar and restaurant was fab, they staff took amazing cate of us all. Carmelo was so professional and personable, we would highly recommend it for vip parties and thank you for taking such good care of us all!!!",5,2022,09,01
228,Excellent stay at Garden Inn Custom House,"I want to complement the entire staff at the hotel restaurant in the Dublin Garden Inn Custom House.  The staff was so cheerful, friendly, and genuinely happy.  We were greeted each morning to a happy hello and lovely breakfast.  Even when the restaurant was completely crowded with tour groups trying to get off for the day, they were kind, efficient, and competent.  
The hotel staff in general was accommodating and kind.  Georgie the manager, and Dan at the front desk were extremely helpful, friendly and accommodating.
Overall, we had a great stay at the hotel, restaurant, and were thankful that they had self-laundry facilities available for guests.
Many thanks to the Garden Inn staff for making a memorable place to stay in Dublin.",5,2022,08,29
228,Great location,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! This was our first trip to Ireland and our hotel was ideally situated for exploring Dublin. We took advantage of their breakfast buffet each morning before we set out to see the sights and enjoyed a cocktail in the hotel bar at the end of the day. Our room was a bit small but was comfortable and had a nice view of the river. 
Would recommend!",4,2022,08,28
228,Good place for a family to stay,"We arrived early in the morning, dropped off our bags, and were able to check in by 1:30 pm.  We were grateful that the lovely front desk clerk found us a room before check in time because our kids really needed a nap.  We opted for one room with 2 beds for our family of 4.  (Rooms for 4 seem to be few and far between in European hotels, so we were pleased to find one.)  The room felt a little tight, but it was probably very large by European standards.  Our Gold status helped us get an upgrade to a room with a partial river view.  And, the window in the hotel opened, allowing us to get fresh air in our room.  The air conditioning cooled off the room very well on the one day we needed it.  There were plenty of towels and toiletries.  We got breakfast with our room because of Gold status.  The breakfast was great.  It was a buffet with a full Irish breakfast, an omelet station, waffles, fruit, yogurt, pastries, and meats and cheeses.  The staff at breakfast was very helpful and attentive, even on very busy days.  The coffee was good too.  We refilled our water bottles in the fitness center.  We liked that the hotel had a guest laundry and parking, but we didn’t use either.  There is a tram stop about a block away, behind the hotel.  We took the tram all over the city.  It was much easier to figure out than the busses.  And we walked to a lot of places too.  There were several convenience stores within a short distance to the hotel where we stocked up on soft drinks and snacks for day trips outside the city.  The room had a small refrigerator that was just right for drinks and snacks.",5,2022,08,28
228,"Amazing stay, top notch customer service.",This was my first time staying at a Hilton chain.  I stayed for 5 weeks for work.  The first day I was greeted at the front desk by the staff who were exceptional.  The Manager was able to help get parking sorted due to me staying for such a long time.  Breakfast and bar staff was perfect during my entire time.  They were very accommodating and took care of whatever I asked for.,5,2022,08,26
228,"Very quiet,and peaceful side of dublin","Hilton Garden inn lived up to its standards and we enjoyed our week stay.All the staff were helpful and after a full day of sightseeing and hiking,Hilton is the place you want to come back to each night,,and we will be back.thanks",5,2022,08,24
228,Great location,"I only stayed for one night after arriving in Dublin, but room was spacious and really comfortable with a lovely view over the river. The staff on reception were incredibly informative and welcoming.
Hotel is in a great location, with just a short walk along the river to get in to the centre.
Parking was really handy too and just around the corner from the hotel.",4,2022,08,23
228,Great service!,We were here with a large group for lunch last Wed 17th August. Kenneth and the staff could not have been more helpful. It was beautiful food and Kenneth was so attentive to us all. Thanks Kenneth and staff!,5,2022,08,23
228,Perfect spot for a family vacation in Dublin,"Great friendly staff. A nice restaurant and bar.the breakfast is definitely worth it. Everything was perfect. Centrally located; walking distance to most attractions. EPIC museum and Jeanie Johnston are steps away. Lots of locals, business people, and flight crew (people who know their stuff) are staying here too.",5,2022,08,21
228,Very pleasant hotel,The staff were very welcoming and made sure we had everything we wanted. The room was very clean and we really enjoyed our stay. Would recommend this hotel for a couples weekend or for easy access into dublin city as everywhere was in walking distance.,5,2022,08,21
228,Businesstrip and very nice stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin,"Special thanks and compliments for the hospitality team at breakfast and bar: lovely host and everything with a big smile and personal attention. Thank you for making our stay so nice.
Also the staf at the reception was nice and provided us with a room with river view.
",5,2022,08,19
228,A big disappointment,"Me and my husband have been travelling a lot around the world  during the last 15 years. This must be the worst hotel experience we have had so far. We payed extra for a good view (riverfront) and payed about 300 euros per night and stayed for three nights. The view we got was in to the office next door…. You could see Liffey river from a corner of the room, but I would not call it a King with river view. The breakfast is nothing special at all. For us swedes it is actually nothing more than a continental “buffet” with much not so fresh food. Ham and cheese layed on plates for many hours and looked disgusting… The last morning my husband didn’t even join me for breakfast because he found it so bad. He went to Starbucks instead… I was about to make a brown bread toast but I was almost about to puke when I saw all of the bread was moldy! Told a guy and he took the tray away. Feel sorry for the guests that wasn’t paying attention. Took a yoghurt and cereals - it was at least wrapped… while checking out Tabita asked if we enjoyed our stay and I couldn’t keep it in. I told her about the view and the bread. All she answered was: “you have had some snacks from the snack bar. You owe us 9 euros”. We paid it, of course, but that was a new low. After a while, when we were waiting for our taxi, the responsible for the breakfast came and apologised for the bread incident asking us if we wanted some pastries to go…  I was not delighted… I won’t ever come back and I will not choose any Hilton again. Next time when we go to Dublin we will try the Gresham which also has a lot better location than Hilton. If you ever decide to stay here - prepare yourself for a lot of walking and bad service.",2,2022,08,18
228,Perfect in every way!!,"I cannot say enough good things about the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin City Centre. First, Megs greeted us and after no sleep on an international flight, she got us right into our room. She also offered very detailed information about the hotel, which was appreciated. She was also so friendly and helpful throughout our trip. I must say all staff were wonderful. 

The room was perfect. Super clean and good size. They thought of all little touches in the room: heated no fog mirror, slippers, fridge and usb ports. We had a beautiful view of the River Liffey.

Breakfast!!! I am feeding a 20 year old college student and we are both vegetarians. As a diamond member, breakfast was included and was wonderful. Again, restaurant staff are incredible.

I could go on amd on with positive things to say, including a very comfortable location.",5,2022,08,12
228,Great place!,"We really enjoyed this property.  Great location and superb staff.  Rooms were spacious and clean (more on this later), public areas were good, gym was nice.  All of the staff was over the top, but Mags at the front desk went out of her way to help us several times. Shows good management!   The breakfast in the Oly’s restaurant that came with was good.  Lots of selection and the staff worked diligently to keep it stocked.  There is also a specialty coffee bar and general bar available.  The only somewhat negative I could see was the room cleaning.  This is a somewhat newer property and they are starting to get the dirty mop water corners in the bathrooms, there were hairs in the bath when we got there, and there was rubbish behind the nightstands.  I’m sure that they are in the same place as everyone and need additional staff.  The room cleaners worked hard and were very accommodating, but I’m sure they were overwhelmed.  Not only would I stay here again, I will be on my next visit to Dublin!",5,2022,08,10
228,Good,"A group of us stayed here when we went to see westlife. The hotel is a nice walk to the aviva stadium and was easy to find. 

The room was clean and spacious. The breakfast was good. The only thing was when we ordered drinks at the bar the employee seemed very overwhelmed and forgot to give us our cocktail.. not to worry that was only a small issue. 

Would definitely recommend and will return again.",4,2022,08,08
228,Coming from the US -- You know what you are getting!,"This is an excellent Hilton hotel.  It has all the amenities I expected from a Hilton Garden Inn in the US.  The location is perfect.  Although it is across the bridge from Temple Bar - it is a short walk to all the places you want to be.  Parking was very convenient.  Breakfast was terrific.  When we arrived, their 24-hour lobby snack shop was well stocked, and I used their business center to do some last-minute travel planning and printing.  I would stay here again- either coming in or leaving through Dublin. ",5,2022,08,08
228,Great on so many levels!,"Would highly recommend this hotel as your Dublin base. From the big things that were great (service, cleanliness, etc.) to the little things that rounded out the amazing experience (a water and ice machine in the lobby to fill water bottles for a long day of touring)--we would choose this hotel again for our next trip. When booking from afar, I was wondering about the location...but the location turned out to be perfect! It was an easy place to get taxis from and we loved it being so close to the river for quick walks.",5,2022,08,08
228,Great service,"Just visited this centre today 6/8/22 served by Danny, who was absolutely a mind field of information of plants that suited our area that needed planting. 
Top marks to Danny and the 2 young lads there , as they were so helpful and polite. Top marks lads and MT Garden centre should be delighted to have ye on the Team as ye do them proud. 
Fab clean garden centre not far from Roscrea, lots parking and the place is spotless, lots of fab plants in door and outdoor looking after all ur planting needs. 
Definitely will be back.",5,2022,08,06
228,"Excellent location , clean, friendly & comfortable","Visited 17th -23rd July. This was mine & my daughter Alana's  5th stay here in 7 years, Sadly covid spoilt the last 2 years plans.

We choose this hotel because it is absolutely amazing!

We feel safe and cared for.  Two females travelling alone.

The rooms are gorgeous and kept spotless. 

The buffet breakfast we had was plentiful and very tasty. 

Staff throughout our stay were brilliant. Attentive, friendly and professional. A special shout out to Inaya (yesterday!) who always greeted us with her beautiful smile,  Faizia, Moira & mags on reception who put up with our numerous questions! Also not to forget the cheerful Spanish young man and friendly, helpful Asian young man (with glasses) in the bar/breakfast areas.   I apologise for mis-spellings of names or not making note of name ;)

We walked everywhere. O'Connell street nearby as is Grafton Street and temple bar just a short stroll away.

Famine statues & Jeanie Johnston replica famine ship opposite side of road, as is the River Liffey.

We cannot thank you all enough. Declan, you run an amazing hotel. Thankyou for your kind  hospitality.",5,2022,07,27
228,"Good Location, Clean and Friendly","WE arrived exhausted and moved through check in quickly and off to our room. As an American I find the two different sized beds interesting but it was perfect. Through our week’s stay the staff kept the room sparkling. I was looking at the Jeannie Johnston and my oily forehead touched the window. It was smaller than an American dime yet the next morning it was gone. 
The staff tried to meet out every need with a smile. They had breakfast bags for us when we were leaving early. They arranged for cabs. They even helped us operate the laundry. 
The Oly staff was friendly from keeping the breakfast buffet well stocked and taking orders out in the bar area when things were crowded. The food was good, delicious and plentiful. 
My only suggestion is to keep the kitchen open later than 2130. When getting back to the hotel just before 2200 and not only is food not available, none of the restaurants in there are are open and even pizza delivery is stopped. Cold sandwiches in the shop would have helped. 
Location is good. Can tell a cabbie the name and they know where to go. EPIC is just out the door. O Connell street and the Temple Bar are doable walk away. 
Would return here for my next family visit",5,2022,07,26
228,"Quick walk across a bridge gets you to shops, pubs, restaurants...","Nice central location.  Easy to catch a cab to the far reaches of the city.
Nice bar for a relaxing after a day of exploring Dublin

Only downside.... really lousy water pressure.... Surprising as the hotel seems very modern...  

Check out the nearby museums....",4,2022,07,24
228,An excellent place to stay,"The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly, and the room we was given was well kept and spotless. The breakfast buffet was well stocked and had a large selection aside from the traditional foods you usually get which I felt covered all taste. Even though it seems the hotel is away from the main city centre it is with in walking distance from the main bar and restaurant areas like temple bar but there are still plenty of pubs around the dock area if you don’t fancy walking into town.",5,2022,07,19
228,Breakfast is delicious,"The staff was always very friendly. The breakfast was delicious, Lisette made the BEST omelets! It was a good location with plenty of shops within walking distance. Right on the bank of the River Liffey so we had a great view.",5,2022,07,18
228,"Clean room, comfortable bed, delicious breakfast","The room and bed were clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was very small with an unusually narrow and very slippery bathtub.  The elevators arrived quickly and were kept clean.  The location was nice, right next to the EPIC museum and across from the river.  We walked everywhere we needed to go, only taking a taxi for the airport.  Breakfast had a large variety of foods.  Everything was well prepared and tasty.  I love the scones in Ireland, and they made very good ones.  We ate two suppers at the bar.  The food was adequate, nothing special, but the intern working in the kitchen made a lovely birthday dessert platter for our granddaughter's birthday.  One problem: We reserved a 6:00am taxi for our ride to the airport.  We watched as our name was put on the taxi list.  We called before we went to sleep to confirm our taxi would be called.  When we went to check out a 5:50am, our name was no longer on the list.  No taxi had been called.  It took a full three hours to get through all of the airport protocols, so not having a taxi available was a real problem that morning.",4,2022,07,18
228,No hassle,Rooms were great. About what you’d expect. Nice staff. Restaurant menu looks good and there are options for every meal and room service. Easy to walk into center city (20 mins to the heart). Love that there was laundry.,5,2022,07,17
228,"Good location, walking distance to all sites","The hotel is in a good location, right across river and walking distance to everything.  Check in was not so smooth, it's a situation where your not going to get many answers, quite curt (Tabitha).  

Hotel is a bit dated in style but has everything you need in room, coffee, fridge, plenty of towels

Restaurant on site serves great room service, very prompt",3,2022,07,15
228,Enjoyed our stay,Rooms are very clean and I felt welcomed and valued as a Hilton honors member. Front desk and restaurant associates are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was good. Definitely will come back when I'm back in Dublin. ,5,2022,07,14
228,Relatively good,"The manager Georgie was helpful in offering us a room upgrade and free breakfast given that we had been bumped last minute from the Hampton Inn, which continues to take reservations despite lacking the staff to open -- it is truly unconscionable. I did not care for Hilton's response to this situation. They were worthless, claiming it was ""generous"" to refund the points I paid to book a room that was cancelled 2 days in advance at peak tourist season. I still have a mysterious charge on my credit card for this room which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars, and I sure wish I didn't have to go through the hassle of getting what I originally paid for. But this hotel is doing its best to make up for the poor service of the Hilton brand overall.",4,2022,07,13
228,Great place & great staff,"Nice, clean and comfy hotel with nice staff, especially Raul, nice and educated guy, makes the difference.
Good service, clean rooms, good gym.
perfect for business and working, quite place and very well located",5,2022,07,08
228,Decent 3.5-4 star level hotel/motel type establishment. Great for conferences but a little far to walk to city.,"Couldn't help feeling like I was in a motel/hotel. There is nothing really plush about the hotel considering it's at the bottom of Hilton brands - it's quite basic but in excellent condition, clean and updated. Probably a step up from a Holiday inn express.  Breakfast is basic but good quality. Omelette station takes forever due to a super slow cooktop. Coffee is the terrible and unsophisticated drip type meaning you'll have to pay  extra for a proper coffee such as a  latte, cappuccino etc. I was on the 7th floor in a deluxe room with a view. It was very motel like. Bed was super hard with a poor quality Hilton branded mattress. Strip lighting under curtains was only half working, a down light was half falling out of ceiling and the wi-fi connection near my bed wasn't working.  Room amenities were inconsistent. Housekeeping never cleaned spoons on any of the 4 days I was here..disgustingly they just returned the dirty ones. Wi-fi was super annoying disconnecting all the time requiring reconnecting if you went down to the foyer or restaurant. Overall it's slightly overpriced for what it is. You wont be disappointed if you stay here by any means but don't book here thinking it's a plush 4-5 star Hilton hotel. I probably wouldn't stay here again because it's a little far from shopping/Temple bar area after a day or two. Got sick of walking back and forth by day 2. Staff super friendly. Be warned room service charges an extra 6 euro tray fee-criminal for this level of hotel.",3,2022,07,07
228,Wonderful staff.  Comfortable quiet rooms on back of hotel with A/C.,"Hilton Garden Inn was a welcome retreat from the busy streets of Dublin. The staff was friendly and responsive and went above and beyond for special requests. Full service restaurant open until 10PM, plenty of seating for the ""full Irish breakfast"" buffet plus made to order omelets and a DIY waffle iron. Breakfast was not automatically included in the room rate, but convenient as the bakeries and coffee shops are mostly on the other side of the river. Just a couple of blocks from O'Connell street (where the historical GPO and the Hugh Lane Gallery are nearby) and the train station (DART). We stayed in the city center for three days before our one week Ireland tour, but chose the Hilton a mile away after the tour to be in a room with A/C and a predictable American style hotel room for comfortable beds and amenities. We were not disappointed, and it is still a short 1 mile walk to the city center, just not across the street from the museums. We stayed here the night before we flew out at 11 AM departure because it was only 25 minutes taxi ride to the airport. Used the app ""Free Now"" to request the taxi. This hotel is about the same distance to the airport as the Hilton Airport location and we were able to enjoy the city right up until our last evening.",5,2022,07,01
228,Oly’s restaurant,The hotel was nice but what was better was the amazing morning breakfast!  Lizette and Kenneth were amazing!  Very nice and attentive to details. Highly recommend to book the hotel room with breakfast!   Enjoy your time in dublin.,5,2022,06,27
228,Great stay with river view,"We were accommodated here at short notice after the hotel we were due to stay at failed to open on schedule. Special thanks to manager Alex who was extremely helpful. 

Facilities and breakfast were excellent. Good  location on river front, suited to those who are comfortable with a 15 minute walk to reach the central area of Dublin on the  south side of the river.",5,2022,06,26
228,Great Stay in a great location,"Great Place, fantastic location right downtown. The staff where great and breakfast was good as well. Stayed there for just one night on an overnight trip to Dublin. The staff were extremely discreet and helpful.",5,2022,06,21
228,"Nothing special, could be cleaner, bad beds","The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin is an average hotel, in a decent area. A bit out of the prime area for tourists, but still easy to get to public transportation or to walk around. 

Check in experience was fine, but the front desk agent wasn't able to give us any useful information about how the public transit worked, where to get a pass, or anything other than pointing out the closest light rail station.

The room itself was pretty standard, but had flaws and needed better cleaning. The beds were fairly firm and you could feel the coils of the mattress. Getting out of bed, the entire bed creaked. For the bathroom, the light switch is in the room itself, so if you're trying to use the bathroom while others are sleeping at night, the entire room lights up. When we sat on the toilet, the entire thing creaked, as if it would eventually fall off the wall. Final issue with the bathroom was the lack of cleanliness, as there was black mold visibly growing on the grout. Cobwebs were found in corners and in the ceiling - this wasn't a room that had been empty for a while, as the hotel was sold out for days prior to our arrival. 

Breakfast was solid, complimentary for us thanks to Hilton Gold status. Great pastries, bagels, yogurts, fruit (2/3 days had a great selection, 1 day had a lacking selection), bacon, eggs, bangers, and more on the buffet.  Also had a make your own waffle station & a chef-made omelet station. 

If they improved the beds & cleanliness of the rooms, I might consider staying here again. ",3,2022,06,18
228,Olys restaurant,"Lovely staff at the restaurant and bar especially , Veneya and Emilce. The food was delicious ,extremely surprised of the presentation!!!
All that matters is team work when everyone works together to make a positive difference.!!!!

228,"Too expensive, no good service, central location","If you spend close to 300 EUR per night and then they tell you multiple times that the room is not ready after the official check in time, I am quite disappointed and for me this is not acceptable 

Good location, very central, but try to look for better options.",2,2022,06,15
228,What a gem,Great customer service and great location!  We are diamond members traveling with family and they met our every need.  The rooms are very comfortable and clean.  The gym and laundry facilities are plus as well.  The breakfast buffet was a great way to start our mornings.,5,2022,06,09
228,"Nice location,  squeaky clean and great customer service!","Lovey quiet area, with a beautiful view of the river.  Comfy beds and a short walk across the bridge to the busy city center.  Train and bus transportation close to the hotel and taxi service at the front of the hotel.  The hotel staff are helpful and pleasant.  The lodging feels more like a full service Hilton.",5,2022,06,05
228,Outstanding customer service and exceptionally clean hotel. Lovely 10 min walk along the river to the city center.,"Top notch friendly and professional customer service at the front desk.  The cleaning crew does a fantastic job throughout the entire hotel. Very close and beautiful walk to the city center.  Taxi and or Free Now service at the front entrance.  Next door to EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum with a nice small food court and The Laughter Lounge nearby for standup comedy.  Security with a hotel key to enter elevator. If offered, get a room with a river view.  Comfortable beds, quiet sound proof room and perfect temperature control. Dublin and the countryside of Ireland are a new favorite. Can’t wait to return.",5,2022,06,05
228,Very well accommodated close to the City Center Dublin,This is a very nice place. Central with a nice view to the river and quiet at night. In less than 20 minutes walking you can reach many famous places downtown Dublin. Very well managed hotel with an excellent guest service. A hotelnwhich we can absolutely recommend!,5,2022,06,04
228,Couldn’t be happier,"I could not have been happier.  I arrived jet lagged and a bit brain fogged.  Staff was helpful and my room was ready.  Room 334 overlooks the River Liffey and that emigration ship replica Jeanie Johnston.  Hotel is next to the EPIC Emigration Museum and genealogy center which is great for a rainy afternoon.  While at the hotel for 3 nights I chose not to have my room services as has been my practice since the beginning of COVID.  On the 2nd day a bag of extra towels and toilet tissue was left hanging on my door - this was a first and very welcome as I have usually had to request clean towels outstanding.  
Breakfast buffet is excellent with eggs fried or scrambled, sausage, potatoes, grill tomatoes, fruit, very good hot coffee, juice, and cereals.  I also had lunch and dinner in the hotel restaurant on the first day.  Potato leek soup for lunch and cauliflower soup for dinner were excellent - good hot soup is my comfort food when tired.  The service is a bit slow when they are busy in the evening.  Prices very reasonable.  
Complementary bottled was located in the lobby.
Also has a guest laundry.
Pristine room and common areas",5,2022,06,01
228,Hilton Garden Inn,Very comfortable room.  Towels were very ruff and thin.  Breakfast Buffet was great best we had in Ireland.  Location was good walk to most things.  Two great attractions next store to the hotel and across the street.,5,2022,05,31
228,we stayed at the Hilton for a week while meeting friends.,"we arrived at the hotel at 10 am even though we knew checking in wasn't till 3 pm the staff were very good and found us a room within a couple of hours which was great as we had been traveling for many hours.
the room was clean and tidy (looked onto a brick wall which was awful but we only used the room for sleeping) the room was to be cleaned every day but wasn't. Also there was supposed to be bed linen change twice in the 7 days that wasn't. the shower in our room was feeble at best no pressure at all my friends who had a room 2 floors up was absolutely fine. Apart from those points great location breakfast at the hotel was ok and Bar was fair prices.",4,2022,05,30
228,"Great location, tasty food, wonderful staff","The location of this property is outstanding, right on the river next to the EPIC museum.  It is easy walking distance from many key areas of the city. We found the staff extremely friendly and helpful. In particular, Alex at the front desk helped us with a pretty significant problem. We had dinner in the hotel restaurant several times and the food was excellent.  Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,05,29
228,Great and friendly staff at Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House,"I had a great experience staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House. I was traveling alone and was made to feel very welcome right away. Caoimhe was exceptionally nice. Everyone was great.

The location can't be beat. A river view with a tram stop just in back of the hotel. Also, next door to the EPIC—The Irish Emigration Museum. I didn't make it to the museum before closing, so I will have to visit it next time. 
Great stay!",5,2022,05,26
228,Great hotel but location could be better,First the positive.  This is a Hilton garden inn and being from the states we are used to the offerings but this location the hotel was more like a full service Hilton.  So from a hotel perspective it far exceeded expectations.  Rooms were nice and large.  All amenities working.  Nothing to complain about.  Location was just okay with bit of a walk to any major tourist attractions.  Breakfast was normal buffet style in Ireland.  Nothing fancy but adequate.,4,2022,05,19
228,Great hotel in a great location,"My husband and I have stayed here a few times and, apart from the great location, we always feel warmly welcomed by the friendly staff. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable, with great room options but the staff really make this place stand out. A really well-run hotel.",5,2022,05,16
228,So many good things to say!,"I can't say enough good things about the Hilton Garden Inn at Dublin!  We tested positive for COVID 19 soon after we arrived in Dublin, and the staff could not have been any more helpful and welcoming!  They actually called in to our room to check on us during our required 7-day isolation.  Room service was prompt and courteous, and our requests for linens and toiletries were met without question.  We especially appreciate help from Dan at the front desk, who was always ready to assist and answer our questions.  He was especially helpful with guidance when our isolation period ended so that we were able to get some sightseeing in before returning home.   My favorite souvenir from our trip was a note from the restaurant staff delivered on our tray one evening.  Not sure how well the picture will reproduce, but it is from Beatriz, Myriam, Joel and Nathan with messages ""thoughts and prayers,"" ""we'll take COVID on together,"" and ""get well soon.""  It is precious to me and I will keep it forever!",5,2022,05,09
228,Hilton Never Fails,"We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House last week.  We were greeted with excellent hospitality and professionalism.  From the Front Desk (Marta and Lorenzo) to the restaurant (Miguel and Lizi), they were all very willing and eager to please us guests.   Marta was always there to help with a smile.  Miguel at the restaurant was special.  We enjoyed our stay very well.  Breakfast was plentiful and delicious.",5,2022,05,07
228,Best breakfast ever,"There was a variety of breakfast items offered, both traditional and specialties.  I selected porridge but then an omelet made especially for me, Along with sumptuous plump grapes.   It was a superb breakfast.",5,2022,05,06
228,Family get together,"Had a lovley evening with family for my daughters confirmation. The staff had a section of the restaurant set out for us when we arrived. I had 17 booked for dinner. A set menu was organised a few weeks ago with the restaurant Manager, All was lovley except when the soup for starters arrived at the table it was Tomato soup, ten of the group had ordered the soup as we where  told vegetable soup was the soup of the day. Apart from this was had a lovely enjoyble relaxing evening.We had two staff members looking after us,and they done a fantastic job ",4,2022,05,03
228,Lovely place would come again,"Fantastic staff who accommodated our stay and late check out. The night manager checked us in on our late arrival and had good local knowledge and recommendations. He also sorted out a misunderstanding with a outstanding invoice pushed under my door. When I called reception he knew exactly who I was and that my balance had been paid upfront so he resolved the issue immediately. He also assisted us with use of our room later than checkout times to assist with our late flight home and even pre booked our taxi back to the airport. 

The room was slightly smaller than anticipated after looking online, howler the views of the river at night all lit up was lovely. The bed was nice and but but a little hard and bed coverings a little thin. 

Breakfast was lovely and plenty to choose from to suit all dietary requirements. However expect queuing to get through to breakfast with the line being held up by guests who “pay on arrival” a little annoying when you’ve prepaid and you just want to get through and start your day. Perhaps have two people greeting customers to breakfast when a que is forming.",5,2022,05,03
228,"Best for business trip, excellent receptionists and restaurant staffs","Decent room condition, quiet. Fortunately upgraded to a River view room as a Hilton Diamond member. great breakfast and the staffs at the restaurant / bar were extremely supportive. Receptionists were also nice. Best for a business trip.",5,2022,05,01
228,Amazing Service at Oly's,Huge thank you to Shay at Oly's in the Hilton Garden Inn - Dublin. He went above and beyond to help arrange for a little birthday celebration for my friend who was staying at the hotel. Shay went as far as decorating and having a birthday dessert ready when my friends arrived.  THANK YOU SHAY! You are so helpful and appreciate your amazing customer service!,5,2022,04,24
228,Not the best,"This is a Hilton hotel but not the standard Hilton hotels used to be, started well when we arrived as greeted by a very friendy man at the reception who was very helpful. Afterwards nearly  every single person at the reception was unfriendly and unhelpful, very disapointing. The room was fine, clean and nice, nothing outstanding for a king size room.....breakfast was good and staff better in the restaurant. Good location which is one of the positives, in general it was fine but no more than that, the Hilton chain is not what it was.",3,2022,04,22
228,Great Choice For a Comfortable Stay in Dublin,"We recently chose this hotel for a 3 night visit to Dublin with friends.  We chose it because we are Hilton Honors Gold members, the hotel is 3 blocks from Connolly Train Station and a walkable distance from most tourist attractions in the city.  

We did a day trip by train to Belfast one of the days and could not have picked a more convenient hotel within a very short walk of Connolly Station.  We also visited the Guinness Storehouse, Temple Bar, O’Connell Street, Grafton Street and St. Stephen’s Green.  All were within walking distance from the hotel if you are in good shape.  

Honors Gold status will get you free breakfast buffet each morning.  The buffet was good quality with a great variety of food.  We enjoyed it each morning.

We found all staff at the hotel to be professional and helpful.  The only slightly weak link was in the bar.  The service there was very slow and disorganized.  On one occasion they got our order wrong, on another the quality of the drinks were very poor.  In each case, the service was slow and the drinks were pricey.  I don’t mind paying more for things when on holiday if they are good but resent high prices when they are not.

We found our room to be small but comfortable and well appointed.  While we were grateful for being able to check in a little early, we weren’t impressed with the view of the alley.  I’d assume they’d try to give a Gold member a little better view if one were available at check in.

Overall, we were happy with our choice to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House and would consider it for future stays in Dublin.  Perhaps next time we’ll have drinks in one of the 15,000 pubs in Dublin instead of the hotel.",4,2022,04,21
228,Not for us.,"I always rate based on would I come back, and for this it would only be for the location and facilities.  
The positives is it has a great aspect looking over the river, a 1.2km walk to the main shopping, easy to drive into, you can unpack out front, parking around the corner ok, good size rooms, fitness centre was good and an on site laundry that whilst expensive is fabulous when you are travelling for months like we are. 
And that is where it ends. 
Breakfast whilst consistent with all Hilton’s it’s the staff. 
I like chilli scrambled eggs, which is made with the same egg as an omelette, but this was too hard. All you have to do is scramble the same egg as let it sit and set. 
The coffee machine is simply awful coffee. 
For dinner  we tried room service. I couldn’t order a rare steak from the kitchen, “this kitchen cannot cook rare”, unbelievable. 
After being out until 3:30pm we get back and our room isn’t done. 
But the biggest problem is you feel like you either don’t matter or are an inconvenience to all of the staff, there is no engagement, and the front desk are abrupt.  Downstairs outside the laundry one of the service staff looked up when we walked by and said good morning, one. 
On this trip alone so far we have stayed at 7 of the Hilton group and this by far is the most disappointing. 
So taking all that in to account, I doubt seriously that we would come back here.",3,2022,04,20
228,"Clean, great location and outstanding staff","I needed a room at a good price quickly and booked with Priceline.com. The room we were assigned was -small, no problem; very clean, great; had a toilet seat that didn't fit the toilet (and would slide to reveal the cold, porcelain rim!); the mattress had coils that popped up and I woke up in such poor shape I could barely walk; the bathroom door didn't close unless it was locked; and the little fan in the room literally fell apart! We went to the front desk and met Ibiwari who handled all of our issues with compassion, empathy and resolve! She moved us across the hall to another very clean room with a better view but a MUCH better bed! I slept well the following two nights. This room, I suspect is typical of the hotel. The restaurant staff (in particular, Agnes) were wonderful.  We needed ice and a slice of bread which confused a young member of the staff. The location was great for catching the local tram system and walking to city center. There is a great Fitness Room, which I enjoyed and was able to use a Laundry Room for some basic clothes washing as we extended our trip! (HUGE help!) I will definitely stay here again and run all over Dublin!",4,2022,04,19
228,A few days away,Heading home from a relaxing few days & would like to thank all the staff. From check in to check out the staff were very courteous & helpful. Also to Kenneth in the bar for sourcing us some pastries this morning as we had a lie in & missed breakfast. We’ll definitely return.,5,2022,04,14
228,Chaos at breakfast ,"I'm here now, no room in breakfast area, so sitting at coffee table, no glasses at water jugs, no milk at tea coffee stand, no batter for waffles, chaos as more and more people come in and can't find seats!!!! Not enough staff to clear tables, waiting now to see if they make more batter ",2,2022,04,13
228,Great Stay with Hilton...,"Great place to stay and very centrally located to most attractions in Dublin.  Staff were excellent, from the front desk to staff during breakfast.  Unfortunately their attentiveness is a little lacking in the restaurant during lunch hours.  No real excuse for it, except maybe spending too much time on their phones.  The room was great and front desk was extremely helpful throughout the stay.  Also do not arrive too early as they are a bit slow in opening/cleaning the rooms for new guests.  We would highly recommend.",5,2022,04,10
228,"Great walkable location, comfortable rooms","Though this was on the other side of the river, it was easily walkable to everything we wanted to see, even with 2 kids (ages 9 and 12).  Front desk staff was friendly and helpful.  We arrived after midnight and the staff was able to open the parking garage for us so we could park there after hours.  Our family room had 2 queen beds which worked well for our family.  We were on the 5th floor and it was relatively quiet, though the bar downstairs seemed to always be busy.  Room was clean and beds were comfortable.  We booked the rate that had breakfast included and the breakfast was great - it was a buffet stocked with all the irish breakfast staples (eggs, hash browns, beans, black pudding, etc), yogurt, pastries, cereal, etc. I was even able to get an espresso.  I felt the rooms were a little over-priced for April, but we wanted a location that was walkable to everything we wanted to see without breaking the bank, so this was a good choice for us!",4,2022,04,03
228,Great hotel,"Great hotel in the heart of Dublin but far enough away to enjoy the peace with the luxury of a Hilton Hotel. This is lovely. Rooms are comfortable and furnished daily with fresh towels and toiletries. The staff are amazing. Maria checked us in and Anna looked after us in the restaurant whilst giving us a locals guide to Dublin. Maria and Anna are amazing waiting staff. To be fair alll the staff including Lizette in the restaurant as well as Maria on check in (Maria a popular name) all amazing. Definitely will come back. Good food in the restaurant too. 
Would also recommend the tram to get you around the City with ease.",5,2022,03,24
228,"Great Location, Clean Hotel with Fab Service","I stayed for three nights with my sister to celebrate St Patrick's Day.
We arrived on Wednesday evening and popped out for a few drinks, when we came back the restaurant was closed, but it was no trouble for the reception staff to help me order a takeaway.
Breakfast was plentiful, my sister was amazed at the amount of bacon available in this hotel rather than ""fighting"" with other guests for a few slices which often happens in other places.  I loved the soda bread with lashing of butter and cheese (diet now started ha ha).
All the staff were friendly and helpful.
The location was great as we were able to walk easily to watch the St Patrick's Day parade. 
I am sure I will visit this hotel again and recommend to anyone who is having a trip to Dublin.",5,2022,03,22
228,Great Service,This hotel has the best staff and service. Very helpful and truly concentrated in hospitality. The managers were visible and present making sure guests were well taken care off  Rooms were comfortable and very clean. Great location as well,5,2022,03,21
228,"Wonderful experience , excellent staff !","We visited over the St Patrick’s day holiday. This hotel made our stay a wonderful experience . The staff were excellent - very helpful and professional, Sarah at the front desk in particular went over and beyond to keep our family comfortable. Nathan and the staff  at the Oly restaurant were also very welcoming and helpful . 
We will most certainly be returning here anytime we return to Dublin. 
The whole family loved this place !",5,2022,03,17
228,Another great stay at the Custom House,"We recently stayed as part of a family package deal for 2 nights including breakfast and a sharing platter.  We've stayed here twice before so know how good the hotel is, a little outside the city centre but beside the Luas which has you in town in minutes.  Room was spotless and spacious for our family of 4.  Only complaint here was the pillows - far too soft, like they were made from cut up foam and very hard to maintain a level of support on them.  Everything else in the room was great.  Breakfast was fabulous as always, plenty of freshly cooked food that was regularly topped up as needed.  Our dinner on one night was lovely, the sharing platter had 4 sliders, onions, chips, corn on the cob and chicken wings and was more than plenty, we struggled to finish it.  We had drinks in the bar both nights and again no complaints, staff were particularly good and attentive on both nights.  Would have no hesitation in staying again!",5,2022,03,01
228,"Lovely hotel, great location, and friendly staff","Had a fantastic stay at the garden inn. The room was spacious and clean with everything I needed. The staff were lovely and friendly, in particular, Miguel in the bar/restaurant, he couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful. Would stay here again!",5,2022,03,01
228,Enjoyable,"Quite good service, very friendly and helpful staff, specially one guy called Carmelo Diaz, they made our stay quite satifying, helping us with tasks beyond their duties, I highly recomend to come, you will feel like at home in this Hilton hotel",5,2022,02,25
228,Lovely staff - great customer service,"We are spending our weekend in Dublin and we booked at Hilton Garden Inn Custom House.
What a lovely surprise to find such a friendly environment, great attention to customers and free upgrade of room with view on the river.
Special mention to Carmelo, very helpful and friendly waiter who welcomed us with a big smile and a laugh for our breakfast time.",4,2022,02,25
228,Absolute Gem!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️,"Do NOT stay anywhere else!! Perfect location. Perfect staff. 

Find Carmelo he will take care of your every wish! Fabulous breakfast. Carmelo will find you hot water and bring you scones!! He will spoil you rotten. 

Beautiful views. Comfortable bed.",5,2022,02,22
228,Valentines Short Break,Clean hotel with friendly helpful staff.   Let us put luggage in storage when arriving early so we could spend the day exploring without lugging it around with us.  Double room more than adequate with fresh towels every day. Breakfast has a huge choice and in abundance.  Cannot comment on evening meal as always dined out. Bus stops nearby but close enough to be able to walk to city centre but far enough away from the hassle and bussle.  Would recommend and definitely use again,5,2022,02,15
228,"Clean, spacious, good location, modern","Very spacious and clean room. The bathrooms is big and clean as well. The breakfast was delicious, however on the second morning the waffle machines were not working. Other than that the staff did their best to accommodate all of our requests, including early check in and late check out at no additional cost to us. Would definitely recommend for couples.",5,2022,02,15
228,Excellent,"Stayed here for the first time.
Prompt check in, well staffed.
Hotel is modern and is of a high standard.
Great location, would definitely book again.
Parking is expensive though(€19 overnight) so factor that in if your driving. Despite that, fine hotel, highly recommended",4,2022,02,13
228,AMAZING STAFF!,"What a lovely hotel, everything you need.

The staff are super helpful and solve any issues and totally go above and beyond.
I had a large group of people booked in and also a person in the Accessibility room

Special thanks to the RECEPTION team and also Pearl and George - total superstar! 

WILL 100% return here. Thanks guys - you made our stay very special. :)",5,2022,02,05
228,Excellent Service | Food,"Planned a night away for my girlfriend for special occasion. Very fast check-inn, all the staff was welcoming. Rooms are well maintained and had a great river side view. Just loved it. 
   Went for dinner in Oly’s lovely food and great selection of spirits and beer at the bar even the staff was very attentive made sure we were looked after. I am sure recommending my friend to stay here. 
Will visit again for sure. Total worth it.",5,2022,02,02
228,Great hotel and great location,"4 of us ladies stayed here on an overnight trip to Dublin recently. Great location - 10 minute walk from Bord Gais Energy Theatre and maybe 15/20 minute walk to O'Connell Street. Cosy, clean, warm rooms. Great selection for breakfast including gluten free. Nicely decorated with a tuck shop in reception. Bar food was good too. The only downside was the bar service, it was shockingly slow. I do appreciate hospitality is finding it difficult to get staff at the moment so we'll blame that. All in all, lovely hotel, would certainly stay again. Great museum next door detailing Irish emmigration, well worth a visit.",4,2022,02,02
228,Great location comfortable rooms wonderful staff,"Great location, comfortable rooms and wonderful staff nice restaurant with complimentary breakfast great value .within walking distance from all major attractions can not go wrong by staying at this great hotel",5,2022,01,08
228,Location great pity about service# sore taste in mouth . ,"We received a night away from my wife's brother and girlfriend for Christmas and said we would go up for a night to get away  
Our room was very nice  and clean .
We received a bottle  of wine on arrival a bottle of red which we Dont drink. We rang down and they swapped out the red for white wine. Much appreciated.   The wine glasses provided in the room had water marks on them and hand prints. No hassle I said rinse and dry job done.
We head out for the day go do a little shopping and decide  while out to have dinner in hotel when we get back . Ring the hotel no problem book in for dinner. 
Roll on dinner nice spacious  restaurant  on site we are asked for out covid passes and  are seated after  we are sat and  water brought to the table. Again I find water marks on the glass and get it changed. The table was sticky to the touch and we let it go. To put it another way the glass was stuck to the table  it was stuck.
We order meal was lovely and starter  main and desert  and a few pints and cocktails. We pay for our meal 115 euro which we though was good price for what we ate.
After I go to the bar to get one more before going back to the room . I pay and drinks brought to the table.  No issues. Then when we decide to leave one of the staff follows us out of the bar and tells us we havnt paid for our last drink when we had in front of other guests  and we clearly had.  To be approached in this manner was both unprofessional  and way we were spoken to  was embarrassing for myself and my wife  we left go to our room and my wife is upset to how we were spoken to and accused of not paying   
I go back down to the front desk and  voice my concerns to the male member of staff on duty.  He apologises to me for how we were spoken to and offer me complimentary  water from the shop on site and  says he will speak to restaurant  manager . 
On arrival back to my room the phone rings and its the manager who apologises  to us and offers us a round of drinks to the room  to say sorry . 
Ten mins pass and drinks arrive . And nothing more said to us . 
I found the behaviour of the staff member in restaurant  was unacceptable  and has left a negative opinion on the service received.
And to be upset in this manner  would make me think twice of staying here again. 
Nothing more said upon checkout even though I mentioned again when asked how my  stay was   ",3,2022,01,05
228,Excellent choice for stay in Dublin,"We needed a last minute stay in Dublin city center and, being a lifelong Hilton guy, I looked for Hilton properties. This one was by far the most affordable (although still pretty pricey but it was around Xmas so it was to be expected) and also centrally located. 
Everything about the stay was satisfactory except maybe breakfast could have been a bit more diverse day to day. Maybe this was Covid related, not sure. But this is nitpicking, it’s hard to find any faults with this hotel. Would stay again!",5,2021,12,30
228,Warm and welcoming. Food a plenty,"I’m going to keep this short and sweet… just like our stay at the HGI. Lovely warm reception that emanated throughout our stay. We were late for breakfast, but they didn’t mind - love that. Lost my watching in the room, they sent it to me - love that  more. Although you might think getting an Airbnb is the better option (as I have done until now), but with the mega brunch on offer you can save money on meals out as it will keep you going most of the day. Waffles are a must. Clean room every day even though we left it in a state - lovely.",5,2021,12,29
228,Good hotel in a quiet area,"This is a typical hilton garden inn: a great place to sleep without spending too much, but with the services of the Hilton family. It is also worth the location which is a 20 minute walk to the Temple Bar area and very close to the office area.",4,2021,12,18
228,Great stay,"We really enjoyed our stay here while in Dublin. The room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the river. Very convenient location just a 15 minute walk to most of the famous pubs and attractions. Next door to a very interesting museum, EPIC. Staff was great, and April the manager quickly fixed a small error on our bill after check out. Will definitely recommend on future travels.",5,2021,12,15
228,Very nice place.,"This is a perfectly lovely place to stay when you visit Dublin. Right next to the River Liffie and within walking distance of many interesting places to visit in the city. 

The hotel was clean, the beds comfortable and the food was excellent.   The staff was very helpful and friendly. 

We would stay here again if we ever return.   We highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,12,06
228,Room Service only on demand and even then……,"We have stayed at this hotel annually over the last few years and were normally pleased with the service and accommodation.
However this year, new measures have been introduced - room service only on demand!! A booking has to be made well in advance! We thought that the room service would be every 2 days but we were wrong. Even when the ordered room service came it was poor and left much to be desired. We had to remind the maid to empty the bins, empty water bottles were not removed - task of another staff member who never appeared!! Chasing after toilet rolls became a real challenge!! This is not what I expect from a Hilton Hotel - please review your procedures as this „room service“ is totally unacceptable !!",2,2021,12,06
228,"Just good location, nothing much more","I chose the hotel because of its great location and familiarity with the chain it belongs. The room was nice, on the smallish size, clean and had everything, accompanying bathroom as well, toiletries included. The service was great when I checked-in but then deteriorated, so no consistency. I was hugely disappointed with breakfast arrangements - and for sure not related to COVID 19 imposed measures. there was no regular bread served at all, only pre-packed sweet pastries and toast. I was also not impressed with breakfast package-to-go worth 16 euro. In addition, in the breakfast area there were not many normal dinning tables, so we were eating at the coffee bar tables, much lower than it was supposed to be for eating, or even higher with lower chairs so your hands are almost at you shoulder level when cutting - maybe good design but not practical at all. My dinner at the hotel restaurant was at the best mediocre, I opted for fish and chips, figuring they cannot do wrong with that. It was flaky all right, but tasteless and fish-potato ratio was unbelievable.",3,2021,12,01
228,Non existent customer service,"On check in only one room was ready, no problem. Very little information from guy checking us in other than “sign here” and give card details. No hello, have a nice day or any curtesy. Asked did we stay there before and when I replied yes said “good saves me having to go through anything with you”. Was asked for mobile number and told would be rang when second room was ready, I am still waiting for that call. Went for dinner and concert in 3arena. On return approx 11 pm went to desk looking for room key and was asked to fill out registration form. I replied had already done that  and was told I would be rang when room was ready. Member of staff just said ok and handed me room key, still no customer service, no sorry, no interaction at all.
On check out following morning went to desk to put in both room keys on check out. Girl at desk just said “just put them  in box” and “what room number?” Nothing else said. Hotel itself was clean and rooms comfortable, it just the staff that let them done. No customer interaction, I can only assume they must have problems getting staff as I have never experienced such disinterest from staff in any hotel certainly not a Hilton hotel before.",2,2021,11,29
228,Not bad but poor service from night staff. Can do better for price.,"The reception staff checking in was great and really helpful. She was a credit to your hotel. Unfortunately the night staff on the Saturday night were not so helpful and extremely rude. He was an Italian gentleman on the desk who, after our key didn’t work, made us feel very uncomfortable. He even said to us we might not even get into our room and be turfed out onto the streets! He also said all our belongings would have been moved by the cleaners and he would need to find them. He accused my partner of being intoxicated which he wasn’t and I was sober myself. We were confused on what was going on and felt we couldn’t ask any questions with a risk of him deciding not to help at all. Low and behold we got back into our room and our room was how we left it. The whole situation could of been dealt a lot better with out making us feel belittled and stressed that our room key didn’t work.
The breakfast was ok but not very good system especially with Covid.
The room itself was nice with no complaints.
I wouldn’t recommend staying here because of my personal experience and have advised anyone who is planing a trip to Dublin not to stay here. You can find hotels that value your custom better.",2,2021,11,27
228,Great stay in Dublin City,"Excellent Hotel, very friendly staff, brilliant room and fantastic breakfast!

I came to the Hilton for two nights with my partner and we had a great stay, all the staff in the hotel were very helpful and polite and the room was more than we had hoped for!

We had breakfast both days which was very nice, especially the waffles!",5,2021,11,25
228,Excellent hotel in a wonderful city,"An excellent urban hotel. It has very convenient facilities for a short and long stay. I have been here for two whole months and am satisfied. As a long-term guest I understand that there will be cleaning problems and in general the management of the cleanliness in the rooms could be better. I have to praise the breakfast which is, overall varied. The management of the entrance to the breakfast varies according to the daily management. And it is a pity even though they have improved. When Agnes and Lizette manage the morning it is excellent.
Agnes individually has excellent management skills. Courteous, organizes the load, professional and always courteous - towards guests and employees alike.
Other days the management is of lesser quality.
Which does not prevent the whole team from always being kind.
I must mention Alex from the reception who always helped and is assisting.",4,2021,11,23
228,Perfect city hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights in November. Hotel has recently been refurbished. Rooms were modern, clean and even had a view of the Liffey. 

Breakfast was excellent as was the dinner and staff were friendly. Like the essentials shop in reception which had most of what u might need.

Only slight issue is that you have to put in a request to have your room cleaned.",5,2021,11,19
228,Highly recommended! Great experience,"I had a great experience here. Niall is a fantastic GM and the propriety is very well run. You can tell he cares about guests. Each person I encountered was pleasant and helpful. I just felt comfortable.  The location is good as well, and I suggest to try to get River Liffey facing room if possible",5,2021,11,18
228,"Great hotel, avoid lunch and dinner","Very happy with hotel staff and cleanliness of hotel.  Great rooms, very good breakfast.  Avoid lunch and dinner in hotel restaurant.  Food was almost inedible.  Not just my food, but 2 of my traveling companions could not eat theirs, either.  Besides the awful food (for lunch and dinner), it took over 2 hours to be served and eat.  Again, breakfast was very good, but I would wholeheartedly recommend to avoid the in hotel restaurant for lunch or dinner",4,2021,11,14
228,A perfect stay next to the EPIC,the location is perfect - you can walk almost anywhere in the center of Dublin.  the setting is beautiful on the river.  the staff were very very helpful and the room was very comfortable. This is the second time I've stayed here and plan to stay again.,5,2021,11,11
228,"Comfortable room, great location",Very clean and comfortable room. The location was in walking distance of much of what we wanted to see in Dublin. The staff was pleasant and responded quickly to our request for more towels/toiletries. We were able to check in much earlier than the usual check in time as our flight arrived in the morning. Would stay here again.,5,2021,11,07
228,Clean and Nicely Located,"Staff was friendly and helpful, and made accommodations for my gluten free sister. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Location was convenient to the trinity college side of town and was an easy bus or taxi ride to other local spots (like the Guinness Storehouse). Would gladly stay again.  ",5,2021,11,03
228,I will come back!,What a lovely hotel. Really nice and friendly stuff. Everything was very clean and beautiful. The Hotel design is really nice. The location is Perfect. Just a 8 minutes walk to the City Center. But the location of the Hotel is really quiet. Thanks for having us!,5,2021,11,02
228,Wonderful hotel,"This was a wonderful hotel that my mom and I to enjoyed. Great views and safety. We slept very well. While the hotel service by the staff and rooms were wonderful, I would NOT recommended eating at the restaurant. ",5,2021,11,01
228,Great location,"Really good location, very clean and helpful staff too! 
Unfortunately the beds are really hard so for anyone with sensitive areas in back, neck or legs I recommend using something on top of the mattress. 

The wheelchair accessible has loads of space both in the room and bathroom.
If you are using a manual hoist be advised TVs floor in the bedroom is carpet! 
Also if you use a shower/commode chair the toilet is raised and even with the seat up your chair may not go over it (mine didn’t) 

The Luas to abbey street or the point village runs frequently just around the corner so it’s idea if you’re on a shopping trip or going to a concert",4,2021,10,28
228,Awful Stay!,"We stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday 25 October. When checking in the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel and our room was clean and comfortable but our night took a turn when we went for dinner at Oly’s. We had dinner with two other couples and we all ordered our mains at the same time.. the mains took over an hour and a half to come out but one main never showed and which we waited 3 hours for! We said it to the waitress and she checked with the kitchen and she said they received the order but it still never came out! It became apparent that there was trouble between staff in the kitchen as we heard screaming which in turn made everyone feel uncomfortable and created an a negative atmosphere in the bar. We seen many customers complaining to the bar staff which they shouldn’t have to deal with as they weren’t the part of issue and they were extremely accommodating and apologetic but there was no sign of a manager even when we requested to speak to him. I’ve never dealt with an experience like this in a hotel especially one rated so highly.

We booked in for breakfast for 9:45 am when we checked in. We were waiting in line for over a half hour due to the fact there was only one person at the counter serving everyone! I felt so sorry for them as they shouldn’t be the only one serving breakfast. Then when we were sitting eating our breakfast my partner noticed a bit of mould on one of the slices of bread. 

I’m not one ever give out or write negative reviews but these aren’t issue that you expect to have when booking a stay at nice hotel. Very negative experience.",1,2021,10,27
228,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"We are still checked in at this beautiful hotel..we are enjoying our stay and will do a review upon check out but so far we are extremely happy, the staff is amazing the managers are so helpful. Thank you for making our stay memorable. Diamond members from Orlando FL. 
RM 535",5,2021,10,19
228,AWFUL experience!,"Room wasn't cleaned properly, little pieces of hair all over the shower. 
Room upgrade (that we requested after receiving an email from the hotel and were willing to pay for) wasn't granted although several rooms very available online. Front desk was apparently lying when they told us they were fully booked. 
No cleaning of the room was available. Apparently only available at a minimum stay of 5 nights. - No one told us that when checking in. 
Quality of breakfast was very poor. 
",1,2021,10,11
228,Peaceful location near city centre with excellent staff,Hilton Garden Inns never let me down and this is one of the best.   The location is good if you want to be out of the city center and want a restful night sleep.  It's very close to the tram stop that I'd recommend to save on walking.  About a 15  minute walk to city centre depending on where you are going but I didn't' mind a walk since Dublin is so cool with with the River to walk along.   I really appreciated how helpful the front desk staff throughout was and especially the breakfast staff.  They were great and were top of their game in providing service.  Would highly recommend.,5,2021,10,10
228,Great enjoyable and felt welcomed ,"Lovely 3 night stay  visited 5-8th October 2021 we arrived at 1030am thinking we would drop our luggage and return at 3pm to check in but Amy on reception advised room was ready and we could check in 
Amy was fab went way above and beyond and really looked after us and gave info and just a great ambassador
The room was super clean and fresh 
We felt safe and protected in every way 
Richie looked after us in restaurant when we stayed for a meal he also really did give a fantastic service 
We asked at reception for more towels were delivered to room within 10mins like wise we asked dor more teabags in the room and reception were so quick in looking after the request 
After reading some reviews I'd say the no notice and just experience hotel and form own opinion based on experience 
Breakfast was great great choices and again the staff were great so friendly and couldn't do enough to ensure guests were looked after 
Location is a little further but I'd stay here again perfect for us 
Only negative we found was the water temperature the hot water wasn't as hot as I'd like and for a Premier brand the tea tray in room was basic cheap options not luxury but that's it and I'd highly recommend to others really cant wait to return- thanks to all that looked after us during a challenging time  goodluck for future ",5,2021,10,08
228,Great hotel,Great hotel perfect location for all the main sights.  Great food and service. The hotel is in walking distance of Temple Bar area and city centre. Taxis ride from Guinness Storehouse about 10 euros each way.,5,2021,10,05
228,"Nice hotel, clean and comfortable","Nice hotel, everything was clean and comfortable. Good location for exploring downtown Dublin. However, we were given a choice by Booking.com to upgrade that included a slightly bigger room and breakfast which we accepted.  We we tried to check in they had no knowledge of this and were asking if we wanted to pay for a breakfast.  We told them about the upgrade and they had to go check with a manager which got us the upgrade for which we had already accepted.",4,2021,10,03
228,Hilton Garden Custom House Dublin.,The hotel was probably the nicest Hilton Gardens I have stayed. They took all precautions for COVID-19.  The front desk staff was very accommodating. Breakfast was great. Lunch and dinner were the same menu but the food was good. The only was the service for lunch and dinner was poor. With that said I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2021,09,29
228,Great Location,"Ideal location, walking distance to all the sights.  Hop on bus stops right in front.  Breakfast was excellent.  The staff went above and beyond.  Sparkling clean everywhere.  I will definitely stay there again.",5,2021,09,29
228,Great location,"The Dublin Custom House is in a nice location of town. You can walk to some nice restaurants and pubs. The EPIC Centre is very close. The room was clean and comfortable. Nice small workout room in facility.   In the  lobby you could purchase coffee, water etc. There were 2 sitting areas in the lobby that were clean and  had a television.",5,2021,09,29
228,Good but could be better,"Stayed here for 3 nights on a city break to Dublin. The hotel is immaculately clean. Everywhere looks fresh and newly decorated. From that point of view it’s faultless.
Our reason with not giving 5 star is that due to Covid there was no housekeeping in the rooms and the bar shut at 11pm. That was understandable however it took repeated attempts to obtain additional towels, coffee and toilet roll for our room. Despite emailing ahead to request synthetic bedding due to an allergy this had not been arranged so we had to contact reception and arrange this again.
Surely when people are staying more than one night it would make more sense to leave a daily  package outside the room with fresh towels and toiletries.  Our bin was also overflowing by the time we left.
The bar closed at 11 with 30 minutes drinking up time as per Covid guidelines. Again understandable but it was clear that staff wanted to leave on the dot of 1130 as at 1110 someone started hovering around our table meaning we were unable to talk and had to leave!!
I would stay here again but it’s just a shame that given the cost of an overnight stay that a few things can’t be tweaked (of course in line with guidance) to make stays easier on the customer.",4,2021,09,19
228,A wonderful stay,"My wife and I had an 11 night stay en route to UK to avoid institutional quarantine! It could have been a more enjoyable experience. Wonderful staff throughout.
The room was both spacious and quiet.  
The highlight for us both was the amazing treatment at breakfast. Both being vegan the staff, led by the wonderful Agnes, went out of their way to prepare delicious food for us each morning. A big shout out too to Lizette for her involvement and the chefs who we did not meet. 
The Covid precautions too were excellent and although this meant room cleaning was limited, fresh towel etc were always available upon request
Overall a great experience in what was effectively an 11 day transit. 
Thank you all",5,2021,09,12
228,Overall a nice hotel,"Stayed here on first part of 2 week vacation and staff allowed us to check in several hours before early after an overnight flight but never received complimentary water or snacks that come with status as Gold or Diamond. Breakfast included for those with Hilton Honors status. Food neverchanges, it is the same each day but sufficient options and variety. Paid extra for river view room but it was not larger. Limited towels and no service of rooms each day but you can ask for extra towels or toiletries at the front desk. They do have 2 washers and dryers on site, although the cost is 3.50 euros for each and the drums are small. It is very popular so be prepared to make multiple trips to find a machine actually available.  Parking us extra and behind the hotel, but there is NOT unlimited in/out privilefunless you pay significantly more than the 18.90 euros advertised on Hilton's web site. Convenient walk across the bridge to Trinity College and the bok of kells. Quite a bit further to attractions such as Guiness Storehouse.",4,2021,09,12
228,Good. Met the minimum standard.,"Location, breakfast and size of rooms all good. Clean.  Parking nearby with a walk through out the back door to get to your car.  Parking costs extra.  My only complaint is the toilets. European toilets tend to be smaller than those in the U.S. however these were particularly small and the button to flush them is behind the seat lid which is impossible to flush if your sitting on the toilet. Makes for an awkward dance.  We had larger and easier to function toilets in 260 year old B&Bs.  Not sure what architect/designer selected these when they built the structure but you need to know your clientele. Poor choice of tool for the job. If you are practicing to be a contortionist or a bombardier, this hotel will provide you a great opportunity.",4,2021,09,12
228,excellent stay,"This hotel is excellent on every front.  Close to bus and train stations, close to city centre and overlooking the River Liffey. A short stroll to Temple Bar and other sites of interest. The staff were welcoming and friendly. Covid precautions were in place - gel and wipes all over the hotel and contactless check-in. Breakfast was very good with a great selection of hot and cold food. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough",5,2021,09,05
228,Unbelievably Terrible 😣,"Stayed here with my GF for 3 nights. 4 star hotel honestly you must be joking. Dirty room full of dust and crumbs which caused me and partner continuous sneezing and hey fever. No house keeping at all due to covid excuses. Broken Kettle then no tissue requested in  receiption and never arrived unfortunately did showered  3 nights with a single towel, trash bin was full no one bothered to check it and finally tiny bathtub. Honestly it can’t Hilton which is way below standard than a B&B. Shocked and extremely disappointed.",1,2021,09,02
228,High quality breakfast staff and breakfast at this hotel restaurant,"Stayed for over 2 weeks a month ago. Breakfast was a joy. Lots of choices; yoghurts, fruit, fresh cooked pastries, scones, waffles and cooked breakfast. My poached eggs were cooked, each day, perfectly. The staff were friendly, efficient, they kept the restaurant clean, customer's well looked after. In particular may I thank; Hansram, Agnes, Lizzie, Kingsley and Andrei. Great team! Thank you.",4,2021,09,01
228,They need customer service training...and the kitchen speeded up,"Waited 25 minutes for a chicken burger - watched a succesion of staff walking out of the kitchen with their staff lunches - and i'm still waiting!!

Tried to speak to reception but the reception leader was less than approachable

Just a waste of time - stay elsewhere

And train your staff to care",1,2021,08,31
228,Well located and nice rooms,"We spent 5 nights there and we recommend this hotel. 
It's well located, the rooms are clean and large (family room) and well furnished.
The staff is very nice and the do their best even with the covid situation.",4,2021,08,30
228,Good location,Stayed here for almost two weeks. Overall the staff was warm and friendly.  I will give a shout out to Alex at front desk - when housekeeping didn’t clean our room - he came up and changed the sheets and emptied trash and brought fresh towels . I wish house keeping was more often than every 5 days - other hotels we stayed at In Ireland during our vacation offered housekeeping daily - up to 3 days apart. The room service  closes very early which is sad. The breakfast is 16.00 Euro and very filling.  The hotel provides a central location in central  Dublin within the walk to numerous tourist destinations and pubs.,3,2021,08,29
228,Holiday break,"We have stayed at this hotel a number of times and have always found it good especially if you have a room over looking the Liffey.
This time we where disappoint as the room we where given was for disabled people and e thought it best to leave this to someone who may need it. The person at the reception was unhelpful or didn’t want to do anything about changing the room implying there were no room available however, in the morning walking to the lifts we could see a number of rooms still with there seals on the door to show they were cleaned ready for occupancy. The shower was poor, no plug in the sink, small things perhaps but we expect better than this.
Also in the restaurant the service was poor, shown to our table the waited 10+ minutes before I went and got the menu’s, then had to call them some time later for them to take the order. 
I will say the assistant manger ( when we got hold of him) got things moving, some of the staff were good others were just lazy. A pity because the food was good.",4,2021,08,25
228,Irish we didn’t have to leave!,"Great accommodations for family of 5, reasonable pricing for location, close proximity to tourist sights, steps from bus pickup/drop off, good breakfast buffet, room service, snack bar and take away options. ",5,2021,08,22
228,Will definitely be back,"Myself and my three kids stayed in this fantastic hotel last night. Room was lovely, big and airy. The staff were fantastic and the food was lovely. Parked car in IFSC carpark next door which was 19 euro for the 24hrs. Visited GPO museum and EPIC museum which is right next door to hotel. Super spot for stay in Dublin. We will definitely be staying again",5,2021,08,22
228,Excellent Hotel Overall,"Good size and clean room
Breakfast very good
Lunch and dinner menu and portions- excellent 
Very friendly staff
Sanitizers placed everywhere around the hotel.  Social distancing and mask wearing mandatory ",5,2021,08,16
228,Superb location,"Stayed here on a 2 night Supervalu breakaway with my daughter. Carpark around the corner but you can walk straight from the carpark across a courtyard into the hotel, could not be handier for a stay as car was safe and secure with easy access to it. Within walking distance to shopping areas of O'Connell Street, Grafton Street and Temple Bar, Connolly train station less than 10 minutes away to get a dart out to Howth, Bray, Greystones etc. Our room was overlooking the Liffey and was spotlessly clean as was the rest of the hotel. All hotel staff were friendly, helpful and courteous during our stay. Breakfast was bountiful and a great variety for all tastes. Highly recommend staying at this wonderful hotel and we will be back again.",5,2021,08,10
228,Waited 3 hours for my hotel room,"Stayed here with 2 others of my friends for the limerick match. My stay was lovely although I was quite disappointed with the staff at reception but I will get back to that. When I booked my stay it asked what time I would arrive and I told them the time I would arrive. Prior to our arrival I messaged the hotel once more reminding them of our time of arrival and they informed me they would have our room ready. On the day of my stay I also messaged them to remind them of our time of arrival. 

On arrival we checked in and we were informed that our room wasn’t ready yet (even though I had informed the hotel 3 times of the time we would arrive) and they kindly obliged to store our luggage. The girl at reception said she would call us within the hour to let us know about our room. I would just like to add when we arrived numerous other guests were checking in and were showed to their room. 

When I returned to the hotel 2 hours after we had first arrived at the hotel our room was STILL NOT ready and she told us we would have to wait 40 mins before it would be ready. 40mins passed and we asked again and we were still told it was not ready. At this stage I was getting pissed off as the match was soon. We ended up having to get ready in the middle of the lobby which was disappointing. Eventually we got the room and it was lovely; spacious, clean and warm. 

Massive shoutout to Pearl in the bar who had a fabulous attitude and was so kind and friendly to us. She was the only one in the bar that got work done. She also delivered to our room the next morning and was so nice and welcoming to us. So a massive shoutout to her for being such a great employee. 

I would definitely recommend this hotel as it was so central and easily accessible however I would definitely call ahead to ensure your room is ready and you don’t have to get dressed in the lobby.",4,2021,08,08
228,Awesome family stay!,"Excellent hotel, we stayed as a family for three nights and it was flawless. The location is great, we used the car park directly behind the hotel, also the luas which stops behind it too and connects you to most of Dublin.
We had a room overlooking the Liffey which was spotlessly clean like the rest of the hotel. There were hand sanitising stations throughout the hotel and we felt very safe.
Breakfast was great value as the kids eat free and they were delighted with the self serve waffle station! Great variety on offer for breakfast and helpful friendly staff at hand.
We also made use of the self service laundry room which is a great addition for families.
We will definitely be returning!",5,2021,08,07
228,TERRIBLE!,"Purchased a weekend away for my friend as a birthday present through SuperValu breaks, she arrived at the hotel to be told it hadn’t been paid for and she had to give her card details and have a €50 security deposit and that SHE would need to contact SuperValu, which in its own is appalling as the hotel should resolve these issues not the customer, I contacted the hotel to inform them that I had been told by SuperValu and a hotel employee on the day of purchase that it was paid for in full and had the bank statement to prove it and was told I would receive a phone call the next day to sort it, heard nothing back, my friend was told on checkout that the issue had been resolved and that it was paid for only to realise when she got home that they had charged the money to her account even though I had already paid for it. Eventually resolved it when they realised they had made the mistake not us. Spoiled her weekend and my weekend with no offer of compensation just told her refund would be back in a few days. Will be the last time she or I will book this hotel",1,2021,07,25
228,Friendly and welcoming,"The hotel was in a perfect location, 10 min walk from Henry street and 15/20 mins from temple bar. Staff were so nice and approachable. The rooms were on the squashy side considering it was 3 girls in each room trying to get ready for a night out. It was more of a business hotel than leisure.",4,2021,07,23
228,Amazing,"I stayed here for 3 nights with my daughters. By far the nicest, most accommodating staff I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Nothing was too much trouble. Food from breakfast to Dinner was top class. I highly recommend the Lamb Shank. Delicious. Everyone had a warm welcoming smile for us and made us feel very comfortable. As a mum travelling alone I could not have felt safer. Plenty of extra towels available on request. Very happy staff in the bar and you can clearly see from their communication with residents that they are well respected as there was lots of chats and laughter. Security was on the ball and the bar closed on time each night. The waffle station was a massive hit with my 10 year old. Shopping district within 10 minutes walk. Luas right behind the hotel.
Honestly I can not speak highly enough about The Hilton Garden Inn.  A good hotel is only as good as the staff running it and these guys were top class.
Massive shout out and well done to Agnes, Cameron, Hansram, Jesus,Orla, Isabel, Leo,Pearl and to reception staff Alex and Everton.  And to the friendly helpful housekeeping staff. Well done.",5,2021,07,19
228,Amazing staff,"The staff in Olys restuarant and bar were among the friendliest and most polite staff weve come across in any hotel we have stayed in. To name a few Orla,Pearl,Jesus,Isabelle,Cameron,Hansram and Agnes are exceptional and catered to all requests we may have had. The food served each night was top notch and presented beautifully. Must stay hotel 10/10.",5,2021,07,19
228,Recent stay,"Nice location, room nice but that is where the niceness ends. 
Food in the bar was tastless. Fish and chips was a good version of donegal catch. Staff couldn't stop coming over asking did we order when we had. After mains we asked for dessert menu never got it when we did we tried to order off the waitress carrying a pizza to another table to be told the kitchen was closed. Same with drinks the bar tender told us the bar was closed as she was pulling a pint for someone. No last orders called
The staff are just rude you could tell they didn't want to be there.
Will I be back maybe location is nice 
Will I eat there no pity cause the restaurant could be lovely",2,2021,07,18
228,Excellent service,"We checked in for a night on the 30th June for our wedding anniversary. When checking in the receptionists  Vren & Chloe were really friendly and efficient and gave us a lovely warm welcome. Our room needed to be changed as it wasn’t up to standard cleanliness wise, but that was dealt with efficiently & without any fuss by Mary the manager. The breakfast next morning was excellent. 
Overall our experience was a very positive one and we will definitely go back. 
Thank you to the staff in the Hilton Garden, Customhouse quay for making our stay very enjoyable & relaxing. 
Louise",5,2021,07,17
228,Lovely break,"The staff were lovely, the price was fantastic and we had a beautiful (but over priced) meal. Under the current circumstances we get things are more expensive but €50 for 2 mains and a kids meal with just water was a  little much. 
It was a nice stay and I would come here again but would eat somewhere else.",5,2021,06,30
228,Gorgeous hotel,"The carpark is just around the corner from the hotel which is great! The hotel is in an excellent location, just 10 minute walk to the Abbey Theatre and 20 minute walk into Dublin city/Grafton street. The room was spotlessly clean when we arrived and the staff were more than friendly, especially when we got locked out of the carpark. A member of staff named Chloe did not hesitate to help us and open the carpark shutter for us. She even proceeded to wait for us to exit the carpark and held the door for us. I will  be recommending this hotel to my friends and family. My only complaint is that the meals, especially breakfast was quite overpriced. 16 euro per person for breakfast is just a bit steep in my opinion.",5,2021,06,30
228,Beyond terrible,The worst hotel stay my family has ever had. Everybody working here seems to be extremely rude and abrupt .Not helpful in anyway. Genuine sense of discomfort in hotel. Night porter letting groups and parties into the hotel that are not even staying there. Would not stay here again if you paid me. Sad knowing im not alone and 99.9percent of the other reviews are the same. Avoid at all costs.,1,2021,06,27
228,Amazing,"Me and my daughter stayed here for a weekend break I was extremely impressed, hotel and room was very modern and also immaculate! Breakfast choice was excellent and tasty. Hotel is in a brill location",5,2021,06,20
228,Thank you for a Lovely Weekend,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel 11th & 12th June and loved every minute of it. As restrictions have started to ease, we like many people have started to venture out again and two nights away sounded perfect.

We have stayed in this hotel before and have always been happy with the service, This weekend was no exception as we could not fault anything about it. So many people forget how difficult it can be to work in the hospitality sector and especially now that hotels must follow strict regulations in order to remain open.

The hotel staff were amazing and the food was superb. A special thank you to Lady Sara who made us feel so welcome and ensured that we had an amazing stay.

The staff of his hotel should be very proud of the service that you provide.

Thank you,
Richard & Lesley",5,2021,06,15
228,Want breakfast via room service? Nope. Only lunch and dinner.,Wanted a few days away so booked and drove to Dublin. All I wanted was a nice few days with breakfast delivered. Guess what...its the only hotel in the universe that only offers lunch and dinner room service. No breakfast. Ill be checking out early and going home where I can make my own breakfast for free.,1,2021,06,12
228,Restaurant staff,"I have been staying here weekly on business. Not only is the hotel and staff wonderful,  but the dining room staff is above and beyond! Especially Cameron! He is thoughtful, courteous, knowledgeable and always makes sure my dining experience is enjoyable and comfortable. Especially during this Pandemic when people are afraid to talk with one another, he has always made me feel welcome, like I'm eating with his family!
I must say I really look forward to saying hello to Cameron when I'm here, I know that the service will always be top notch. He is a true asset to the guests that chose this hotel. 

THANK YOU TO CAMERON!

A dedicated diner

228,Not worth your money!,"Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights Friday / Saturday of a bank holiday weekend. Our dining experience was dreadful on one of the nights..€30 steak came out cold, my boyfriend had to have 4 different types of beer as they ran out of drinks. I was told there was no more Pinot Grigio left so I swapped to a different wine to find out that there was Pinot left in the back the bartender just didn’t look. We had to wait half an hour after we finished our drinks before we were served again. At breakfast 2 tables of 4 were seated after us but served first our breakfast took 40 minutes was wrong and had to be sent back. We asked for toast 3 times and it came out cold and after we had finished eating. The service was utterly terrible and ruined our stay completely, would never recommend the hotel and will spread the word about our awful stay. The bar staff were lovely and tried their best but poor management resulted in many mistakes and dissatisfaction.",1,2021,06,08
228,Central Downtown Location with a friendly staff!,"We stayed just before the city opened back up to tourist travel. Most restaurants were shutdown except for takeout. All bars were closed. The hotel restaurant and bar was open and it was a real lifesaver. Now that things are getting back to normal, this hotel provides a central location in downtown Dublin to walk to numerous restaurants and pubs.",5,2021,06,03
228,Excellent stay,Really enjoyed our stay! Rooms spotless and staff were helpful and friendly. Parking was easy and convenient. Food was also great! I had the Caesar salad with prawns and it was amazing. We will be back! ,5,2021,04,29

The food is great, the service is outstanding and the place is just beautiful. I’m always greeted with a smile and in a very friendly manner. If you come by, I really recommend stopping by Oly’s to experience great food and service!",5,2021,02,09
228,Excellent!,"This year has been very difficult for us all, and as a singleton, I decided to spoil myself over Christmas. I'm so glad I choose this venue.

The place itself is spotless throughout, and all the staff are so caring, approachable and lovely. Nothing is too much for them to do to help, and it was particularly nice to meet Cameron and have a very involved and interesting discussion with him. He is a very pleasant and highly intelligent young man, who will go far.

The food here also is excellent and for an establishment of this quality, remarkably inexpensive.

Many thanks for making my Christmas so enjoyable.

Some of the work I do is in the tourism industry, and as part of that, give recommendations for dining and accommodation to my passengers, and will have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending the Hilton Garden to them whenever I can.

I hope that the leisure, tourism and hospitality industries recover and can fully reopen as soon as the current crisis has been overcome. As it seems rather harsh to me that places such as this, that are so careful in every element have to curtail their trade whilst others that aren't as careful can remain open.

Thanks again for a lovely stay.",5,2020,12,27
228,A safe and nice place to stay,"This is an excellent Hilton Garden Inn, I spent three days here recently. The hotel is managing the current situation very well.
It is clean and the restaurant is setup in a very safe way. Breakfast is good, with hot selection, better than the average.
Rooms are on a smaller side but well appointed and Diamond members are usually upgraded to a river view or a superior room available.
Staff is very friendly and professional.
Location is also good, easy to walk around the city centre.
Definitely a safe and nice place to stay",5,2020,12,21
228,Comfortable Room,"We stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn on Sunday, 6th of December for 2 nights. The room was very comfortable and it really met our expectations. We had an early check-in and that was much appreciated. Both the girl on the check-in and a blond one that helped us booking a night to our friend were really friendly and professional. We decided to book breakfast on Tuesday morning and it was average, we expected a bit more for a 4 star hotel. Staff on check-out was not so pleasant as she never looked at us once but the overall experience was nice, quiet hotel and clean.",3,2020,12,17
228,Deffo Recommended,"Had an amazing time at Hilton Custom House,  stayed there over the weekend, and couldn't praise the staff enough . Room was clean and tidy, the restaurant was great, food was very nice and even though it was very busy, the staff were lovely and accommodated us even though we didn't have a booking,the whole stay was a delight from Check in to check out, will deffo recommend and will be back soon",5,2020,12,15
228,Family stay,"Had a fantastic stay at Hilton, the room was very comfortable and catered to my needs, and i visited the restaurant the staff were amazing, so lovely and friendly, i really enjoyed my meal, the food was beautiful, i cant wait till my next visit 😎",5,2020,12,15
228,Worst hotel stay ever....,"We stayed here as a party of 6 adults and 4 children, we had booked dinner for 6:30 but came back a little early and our table was ready.... after our 2 hour dinner slot we were told if we wanted to purchase any more drinks we would have to have them in our rooms... at 8:30 in the evening.... we asked why, to be told 1.) Covid restrictions....(not the case)
2.) They needed the table... (not the case)
3.) Drinking is not permitted in the lobby...(not the case)

After a very heated conversation with multiple staff members about the lies and lack of any understanding of covid restrictions we were 'permitted' to stay in the bar and continue our evening.

Fast forward to 2:30 am, the four adults in the family room next to us were still partying noisily... it took 2 phone calls, a trip to reception and a threat to call the guards to get it sorted.

On checkout the receptionist informed me the hotel is free to set it's own covid restrictions and I agree this is true, however, if you are only going to allow guests to spend 2 hours in the downstairs of the hotel it should be clearly stated on booking.

",1,2020,12,14
228,Just ok,Stayed here for 1 night. It was just an ok stay. Staff are courteous and room was very good. Ordered Room service and pizza was inedible and asked for French fries and we were given hand cut thick chips which were not French fries- disappointing! Other than that not a bad hotel for a city break. ,4,2020,12,09
228,Very average,"Stayed here for work during covid pandemic. Room was clean and bed was comfortable.

Breakfast was not with paying for, plastic wrapped Danish like rubber, warm orange juice and limited hot food. Asked for a poched egg and was told.not possible. Really no effort made.

There are other coffee shops around still open offering fresh food, would advise finding them.

",3,2020,09,24
228,Weekend Visit,"Booked this Hotel for a birthday weekend away. We stayed here some years ago when it was operated by Jury’s, so were aware of its location which is perhaps the major plus in its favour. Firstly we arrived early expecting to drop of our luggage but were delighted to find they had a room ready. The cleaning regimen was explained to us when booking in. In essence the room had been sanitised and sealed before our occupation and would not be serviced during our two night stay. If we required replacement towels or tea coffee etc we were asked to do so via reception. Understanding the constraints forced by Covid on hotels we were happy with this arrangement. However, we were let down by the inefficiently of staff to meet these arrangements, in that, we asked for replacement towels when going out on the first evening of our stay and were assured they would be left outside the room, in a plastic bag, on our return unfortunately they did not materialise. So we had to chase reception for them. While our room was quiet and comfortable it was quite small. If the chair in front of the desk was in use you were unable to pass to get to the other side of the room. Lastly, while the the provisions and waste basket are adequate for an overnight stay they were not for a longer stay. It is suggested that replacement towels and provisions are provided on a nightly basis for those patrons staying more than one night and a larger bin be provided. I must add that we found the compliance with Covid requirements to be of a high standard at this hotel.",3,2020,09,01
228,Bring your own loo roll 🤣,"We booked a last minute family weekend through Booking.com. The reception staff were very friendly and first impressions were good. We did however then find a dirty child’s sock (not ours!) behind the curtain in a room and a sweet lying on the floor behind the door of our ‘Covid-19 cleaned’ Room🙄. We also ran out of toilet roll and asked twice for toilet roll to be sent up (as no daily room cleaning with Covid). This did not happen. 

The reception team were very friendly and did apologise and it was not acceptable but could offer no refund as we booked through Booking.com, the kids got free drinks and snacks. 

Despite this we really enjoyed our stay and would still return hoping that these were just a hiccup. ",3,2020,08,31
228,Overnight stay ,"Arrived after 11pm . Reception staff very helpful & professional & opened up the car park promptly to enable us to park . Check- in was quick.  The room for 3 adults ( Twin ) 
was modern , very comfortable & exceptionally clean . It was very well equipped & the beds excellent.  We had a very good night there but didn't have time to have breakfast. 
Overall , a very pleasant but short stay.  Hotel felt very welcoming , quiet , bright & well run . 
We would definitely stay there again but probably not with a car as parking cost is too prohibitive if staying more than a night.  ",5,2020,08,23
228,Great friendly hotel,"Myself, my four daughters and my mum and dad recently stayed at the Hilton garden inn and to say the staff were welcoming and friendly from the start would be an understatement, nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their  way to accommodate us and make sure we were comfortable. The only downside was the breakfast,  which was not as I would expect from a 4 star hotel but I think Covid had something to do with that and perhaps in better times the standard would have been higher but apart from that it was a most enjoyable stay, the rooms were compact but had everything we needed and most importantly a very comfortable bed, I would highly recommend a stay here",5,2020,08,21
228,Excellent place to stay,Fantastic price my stay here for the 2 nights with my family was brilliant the breakfast served in the hotel was delicious and the staff were very friendly and the room we were in was beautiful very close to everything with the luas right behind the hotel,5,2020,08,06
228,Very Disappointing,"My son and I stayed in this hotel at the weekend and we were very disappointed. Reception was fine, hand sanitisers available and friendly staff. It was mainly the food that we felt wasn't up to scratch. We ate in the restaurant to avoid having to go to another location but the food was dreadful, practically no choice for coeliacs - yes there was one gluten free dish but I don't particularly like risotto. So I was restricted to a burger with no bun and vegetables. The fries or sweet potato fries are all fried with other food so not GF. My son had burger & chips but couldn't eat the chips as they were totally over-cooked. We were very hungry so ate it. However, the only other couple in the restaurant sent theirs back. The carpet in the bedroom was stained and there was no shower cap but other than that it was fine. But the breakfast was a real disaster. A bag delivered to outside the bedroom door with a carton of juice suitable for a child (with a straw), crackers/croissant but no plate to eat off of, yogurt and fruit. No coffee and the facilities in the room only had instant coffee sachets. This should be clearly mentioned on the web page  as I paid extra for breakfast (I booked through the hotel web page directly). I was asked did I enjoy my stay when I was checking out but nobody was too bothered with my reply. I understand times are difficult for hotels but that is no reason to provide poor quality. The web site is also geared for the US as it outlines US requirements under Covid19",2,2020,07,27
228,Great Location and Amazing Breakfast,"This hotel is in a great location for anyone visiting Dublin or heading to the 3 Arena with paid parking adjacent to the hotel which was very convenient. 
Throughout the hotel the staff were friendly and when checking out we were able to get our parking at a discounted rate.
The rooms were very clean and comfortable with a modern decor. 
Breakfast was fabulous. Lots of variety and plenty of food, defiantly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had and I cant wait to go back just for that!",5,2020,07,15
228,Spotlessly clean.,"Stayed here july 3-4. This was the first hotel i've been in since they were allowed open again. Was a bit wary but when I checked in everything was great. Very well organised reception and great staff.
Room was immaculate and even smelt clean so was well impressed. 
QR codes for menus and info are a great idea and ordering room service worked fine.
Only slight wrinkle was they need to bring back their full irish breakfast!!",5,2020,07,09
228,Average HGI,"Hotel and room were clean. Before we left to explore the city, we requested additional towels for the room. They were never delivered. We came back and ate dinner in the restaurant, it was okay, nothing special. The breakfast buffet was good, with many options to choose from. It was very busy, but the team members kept everything mostly stocked. The hotel is located right on the AirLink Express (stop is just outside), which was very helpful as we had an early flight out. The hotel is located within walking distance to many attractions.",3,2020,07,02
228,Great as always,Stayed back in january for a conference and as always the team are wonderful. Just called for a lost receipt and I could find Vlasta to be more helpful and lovely on the phone. Super customer service.,5,2020,06,23
228,Oly’s Bar and Restaurant,"Needless to say, the Hilton staff members were very friendly and the room was clean and very nice. Not often do I point out hotel restaurants, but the restaurant inside of this hotel was wonderful.Oly’s Bar and Restaurant had an array of delightful food that was delicious. No matter what I ordered, on a few different days, The food was always fantastic. Furthermore, I have to point out two staff members from this restaurant. Akshay (server and cook) and Sushil (manager) we're always very friendly and kind, and always greeted me and my friend with a smile. These two gentlemen went above and beyond in terms of service and professionalism. It certainly made our stay there that much better when these two individuals made efforts to get to know us and make sure our needs were met, While we were on holiday in Dublin Ireland 🍀.",5,2020,03,12
228,Very good hotel,"Really nice hotel, very nice food and lovely staff. Great location, very near 3 arena. Right beside the Liffey. Everything in great distance. Akshay in particular looked after us very well on our stay and made lovely cocktails.",5,2020,03,10
228,Would definitely stay here again,"Stayed here for one night and could not fault. Hotel was very modern, clean and well equipped. Location was also great - about a 10 minute walk to the centre, and ideally located for the Airlink Express (stop is just outside). Far enough away from the hustle and bustle, but close enough that everything was accessible. 

We booked a king size river view room and it did not disappoint. Room had all the necessary amenities and provided mini toiletries.

Breakfast was amazing - plenty of standard hot and cold food, as well as on omelette station and waffle machines! 

We booked direct with the hotel and were able to check in via the app, and we even had the option to choose our room. This process was simple and pain free, and made the process easier when we arrived at the hotel.

Overall, I could not fault this hotel and would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2020,03,10
228,Super modern and clean,Also very centrally located in Dublin and near public  transportation modes. Staff super efficient and good very good on site. Would definitely go back when in a Dublin next time! Lobby is perfect for waiting for friends and visiting. Appreciated the extra window sound muffling glass!,5,2020,03,07
228,"Just what we needed, Need help with in-room dining",We enjoyed 5 nights at the hotel.  The service was good and the hotel was clean.  Even though it is close to O'Connell street it felt safe and secure.  We had a great experience except the room service food tasted terrible and not worth the money we paid for it.  I could hear the guy in the room next door snoring and the road noise was louder than you would think for the 5th floor,4,2020,03,06
228,Excellent!,"I spent a week here and I would totally recommend this hotel. Rooms are nice and clean, breakfast is superb (try the waffles!). Everyone was extremely friendly, especially the bartenders - Akshay, Jesus and Vinicius. It felt like home!",5,2020,03,06
228,Excellent all round,"Clean rooms, very friendly staff, amazing food from the restaurant. Got served by a lovely man called Akshya who was very helpful from the second we entered the restaurant and took care of us throughout our meal. Very clean restaurant and quick service. Would recommend for anyone staying in Dublin! 5 minute walk from the 3Arena so perfect for people who enjoy concerts and shopping centres are 10/15 minute walk from the hotel.",5,2020,03,02
228,Beautiful! ,"I spent 5 nights here with my boyfriend and we are very happy about our stay.
The room was nice, clean and comfortable and the hotel is located in a quiet area, about 15 minutes on foot from the city centre and well connected with public transport.
We loved the breakfast (especially the home made waffles!!) and the food at the restaurant was nice as well.
Very welcoming and helpful reception staff!",5,2020,03,02
228,Restaurant,"I had a really good meal, I recommend eat the 'Briskets Burguer'. The place is  clean. I am here from visit and my english speak it's no good, thanks god was a waitress from Uruguay how spoke spanish and explained to me the menu. Go to there!",5,2020,03,02
228,Very Good hotel in central location ,"The Hilton is in excellent condition and the rooms are very comfortable. Check in was very quick and friendly. We stayed in a twin room and the beds were so comfortable. Hotel is very clean and well maintained. We had dinner in the bar which was very good, and breakfast was also very good with good choices. Will definitely stay again",4,2020,02,29
228,Very good,"Recently visited ordered from the bar food menu.  Food came in a reasonable amount of time. Overall a very pleasant night

228,Excellent hospitality,"I hosted my birthday dinner in Hilton Garden Inn near custom house and one of the waiters, Akshay, showed excellent hospitality throughout the dinner. Me and my friends have tried different types of cocktails and hard drinks. Along with that he also has a great knowledge on which food tastes better with what drink for all of my friends. The staff was very friendly and the decision to choose this place was a big hit. Overall I would say that we had a great experience on my birthday.",5,2020,02,26
228,Wonderful Hotel,"We were first time in Dublin and first time in this hotel. Location fine.
Very professional standard especially the hospitality from the front desk.

The breakfast was good and staff serving at the restaurant were all very polite and friendly.
Only one thing to remind the restaurant was that staff should not put his hand inside the paper bag for takeaway service.",5,2020,02,25
228,Ideal Family friendly hotel in Dublin,"Family friendly for our trip to Dublin to celebrate a birthday. The hotel was ideally located for us in easy walking distance of O’Connell Street and Temple Bar areas and with an airport shuttle bus right outside and a LUAS tram stop close by. Great staff, spotless room!",5,2020,02,23
228,Dublin Break Feb 2020,"Booked through Secret Escapes - convenient location (on the River Liffey, directly opposite the Jeanie Johnston Tall Ship, next door to the EPIC museum, and an approximately 8 minutes to the hustle and bustle of City Centre.)

Dublin Airlink bus stops right in front of the hotel (take the 747 from the airport to Dublin City Centre, or for pick up, 747 towards the airport.) 

Stunning King Bedroom with river views. Clean and comfortable. 

Breakfast was an absolute pleasure to consume. From cereal, meats, cheese, yogurt, full english breakfast, porridge, waffles, omelettes... I myself favored the omelettes, whilst my partner made an average of 4 trips per Breakfast!

Friendly and helpful staff.",5,2020,02,22
228,Great all round hotel for business or tourism- amazing breakfast too!,"Hotel is bright and fresh in appearance and supported with great service. The breakfast buffet is a must, no stone is unturned with the options available. The city is a short scenic walk (10mins) and the Guinness store house is a couple of stops on the tram located behind the hotel (stop right outside the hotel). Handy for East point business park and the airport. ",5,2020,02,20
228,Great Irish City Break,"Such a lovely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. Rooms are modern, clean and comfortable. The hotel is a 10 minute walk into the city centre and the airport bus stops right outside. Staff are very friendly, warm and welcoming. Definitely recommend the breakfast add on option, great quality, price and huge variety of tasty breakfast options.",5,2020,02,19
228,Beautiful hotel,"Clean and spacious hotel room. Ate at Olys restaurant twice and the food was absolutely outstanding. Joanna the waitress was friendly and wonderful at her job. Would definately return again! 

Only downfall, a male member of staff walked in on my partner in the bathroom when he dropped room service off at the room, as he opened the wrong door to leave. It was an accident but made things very awkward in our stay.",4,2020,02,17
228,Great trip to Dublin,"We stayed at the Garden Inn for two nights in February, we arrived very early expecting just to leave our luggage but our room was ready, we were upgraded free of charge to a king room with a great view. Room was spacious and spotless. All staff we met were brilliant, really friendly and helpful. Breakfast was amazing, a huge choice. The location is great for wandering around the city and the added bonus is that the airport  bus stops outside the door. ",5,2020,02,16
228,Good business Trip,"2 successful days with customers. And the Hotel in the middle of Dublin, what else...
The Hotel is located close to the Dublin night scene. Also good traffic connection. A bit of a problem with the parking. No discount available in the nearby parking place when Hotel guest.",5,2020,02,14
228,Two night weekend stay ,"Check in staff friendly and helpful. 

Bar and restaurant staff less so. Had to go and find waiter on more than one occasion to order a drink. 

Rooms good quality and well kept. 

Good location and easy to navigate to and from on foot - easy cab ride from the airport. 

Would stay again but wouldn’t bother with the bar. ",3,2020,02,14
228,Best business hotel in Dublin,"What a great hotel for business. Great location in the IFSC with the local tram service Luas at the front door. lots of super restaurants nearby, small but good gym and great breakfast - Have the waffles .. The staff are so professional and helpful, a pleasure to talk with. Car parking behind hotel as well with direct access to the hotel.",5,2020,02,12
228,Pleasant stay,"Great location
Helpful staff
Nice hotel
Very comfortable bed

Asked staff to look after luggage once checked out and they did, saved a lot of hassle 

Staff handled taxi requests

Since I was a Hilton honours member, was provided with upgrade, very quick and easy to become a honours member",5,2020,02,09
228,Nice Hotel,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and we had a good experience. Hotel is well located. Bus stop is just next to the hotel. Temple Bar and main town are just few minutes walk from the hotel. We are given the room which has great view of river Liffy and the other side of Dublin town. Rooms are clean and staffs are helpful. Especially the supervisors in the restaurant they did a great job(the male supervisor from Nepal and a lady supervisor. Sorry I am poor in remembering the names).  However waiters in the restaurant seems unprofessional and ignored with such a bad attitude especially the male waiters. I think Management should give extra attention in this area. 
Rest everything is nice. Not to forget they have a great Menu with resonable price. We tried almost all the food on the menu and everything was great. Highly recommended for any guest who are looking for hotel in Dublin.",4,2020,02,03
228,Clean and simple,"Highly recommended. Room was clean and perfectly up to standard. Staff were more than helpful and the bar/ restaurant downstairs came in handy. Recommend stuffing yourself with their menu and spending the evening in the bar. Location okay, about 15/20 away from temple bar and very easy to get to from the airport. Would come again ",5,2020,02,03
228,Very Poor impression and access from car park,Difficult and unsightly access from carpark past laundry and waste bins. Not the nicest first impression. Carparking difficult in evenings. Not great view of Dublin from hotel room. Could do with better service.,2,2020,02,01
228,Very nice Hotel,"The Hotel is obviously in good shape. The personnel at the reception was outstandingly friendly and the service good.
The room was very good. Everything worked properly. It was clean and large enough. I felt welcome and had a good night sleep. The breakfast was enjoyable and I will most likely return.",4,2020,01,28
228,Location just far enough away from the city,Great location as it’s close enough to walk to the city centre (10-15mins) but far enough away to be free from noise. Nice location on the river with decent size rooms. The bus stop is right outside the hotel so getting to and from the airport via airlink is very easy.  Friendly staff and clean,5,2020,01,27
228,Convenient stay,"a 4 nights stay in a welcoming hotel, restaurant and bar convenient and pleasant
Front rooms exposed to the street are slightly noisy with trucks and buses in the morning
Tea/Coffee/Sweeties and toiletries conveniently on sales 24/24
",4,2020,01,27
228,Really good experience,"The staff are always nice, polite, professional and ready to help. The rooms are clean and comfy. The location is so central, just a few minutes walk from the city centre, there are bars, restaurants and a supermarket just a stone throw away",5,2020,01,26
228,A nice hotel by the water in Dublin,Room lovely. Bed comfy breakfast was great and a nice little gym too. Service was also good. Would recommend a good location. Within walking distance to the main shopping area too. Nice view overlooking the water,4,2020,01,22
228,"Good location, good price, good attention to detail ","I’d booked in advance so got a good deal on the price. The lady on check in was not very welcoming but the overall stay made up for it. Little things you’d expect in a Hilton. Almost sound proof rooms despite being on a main road, weights in the shower curtain and lights in the wardrobe. Really clean room. There were 3 of us booked in however only provided 3 cups etc.... luckily housekeeping were still around so it was easily resolved. A good 10 minute walk to the centre but we found out that the tram was just behind the hotel after our stay if needed. Would stay here again and recommend. ",4,2020,01,21
228,Fantastic new hotel in great location.,"Loved it!!

Very new, very clean, amazing location on the banks of The Liffey,the restaurant and bar service was fantastic and I had the best hotel breakfast, I have ever had.

Perfect for business or pleasure",5,2020,01,20
228,"Great Location, Wonderful Staff","We stayed in room 535, a king room with a river view. The room is in the corner of the building and is a bit bigger and quieter I believe. We arrived at about 2 pm, too early to check-in but Lucas at the front desk was kind enough to store our luggage. We did several hours of touring, shopping, and dining nearby and when we returned, Lucas remembered us, grabbed our key cards and promptly helped us get our luggage. We slept well, enjoyed hot showers and tea in our room. When we checked out we let the front desk manager know about a couple of maintenance issues (leaky toilet, broken WC fan, etc.) and she was very kind. Overall the value and location are why we booked this location. Upon arriving in Dublin, we were able to walk there from the train station with our luggage and then leaving we picked up the airport bus right out in front of the hotel. So it's super convenient for transport and it's close enough to all the tourist hot spots that you don't need to take an uber anywhere. We've stayed at other locations in Dublin but would definitely come back here again.",4,2020,01,18
228,Absolute nonsense!,"I generally don't moan in my reviews but this hotel receives my first moan for 2020. There is the word ""Hilton"" in its name but that's where the connection ends. Hilton 20 years ago was an experience, all over the world, you felt posh for the few hours or days you stayed. This one has no feel of plush about it. I only popped in for a beer as my bus was late. 
When you walk in you have tubes of pringles and crap for sale on the left of the entrance, some sort of self service counter, like an American motel. The reception desk is straight in front of you and the lounge, bar, library, coffee dock to the right of the entrance. 
I did not know whether I was in a coffee shop or a bar. A pint of beer, flat and poorly served was a whopping €6.90!!!! The barman presented the pint then took it back, spilt some of the beer in the tray and topped it up again.What???? This is the friggin Hilton and you cannot pour a pint in one go?

In a nutshell, if the bus stops and taxi rank were not outside, this place would be toast. An over-priced motel with the Hilton brand stuck on its roof. Avoid if you are looking for 5 Star Hilton experience, if this was in Dubai, it would be a roadhouse!",3,2020,01,17
228,its a hilton,"very clean, newer hotel with wifi,  great breakfast and location was about a 20 minute walk to trinity we had a nice view of the river beds were comfortable parking was difficult to find and hard to get back to hotel to checkout. lost for a bit of time but would stay again",4,2020,01,16
228,Great hotel with an amazing breakfadst,"I’ve stayed here before and I loved it that I came back . I even believe that the hotel is a 4 star now.
Location is great, rooms are still new and clean and check in staff is great.
The breakfast spread is one the best you ever see at a hilton! by far my favorite.

A few flaws which are:
- very slow service at breakfast, each days most of the tables were not cleared and you’d struggle to find one clean by 9:30am.
- surprised that i needed to pay for a toothbrush in a 4 stat hotel or even for a diamond member.
- got a 2pm tough many people got it so maybe they could give diamond members a 3/4pm check-out when the hotel is not full.",4,2020,01,16
228,Great location and very comfortable ,"We stayed on this hotel as part of a Globus escorted tour. I have stayed at Hilton Garden Inns in the U.S. and am always pleased. This was an equally pleasant stay. First, the location is easily reached from the airport via Airlink route 747 for 7 euros per person. The North Quay IFSC stop is just a 3 minute walk to the hotel (the airport return pick up is in front of the hotel). The hotel is also a reasonable walk (if you are fit for walking about 20 minutes) to the Grafton Street shopping area and Trinity College. The hotel's facilities are great. Our room (125) was clean, quiet and comfortable. The free wifi was strong. The food in the restaurant  (we had breakfast and dinner) was very good and all the service was excellent.  We would stay here again.",5,2020,01,13
228,A lovely hotel made special by the staff,"Every year I stay in this hotel with my sisters and our girls while we go to a show in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. It's always good but this year it was even better! The hotel has been renovated and bedrooms and the restaurant area have been revamped very successfully. The rooms are very comfortable and very quiet. We had an excellent night's sleep and a very tasty breakfast. But it's not these nice frills that make this hotel special, it's the staff. Without exception they are friendly, helpful and extremely hard working. Nothing is too much trouble for this crew. I want to single out Sarah on reception who was a lovely welcoming face and went to a lot of trouble to make sure I got a beautiful room. I travel a lot and having recently stayed in a very expensive London hotel I feel like contacting them, to tell them to contact this hotel to get some tips on staff training. 
Well done Hilton Garden Inn! I can't wait to come back.",5,2020,01,12
228,Terrible,"Our bed was way too small.  Bar staff awful. Not as near to 3 arena as first led to believe by the hotel. Will not stay there again 
Our room was over looked by an office block
Breakfast was like queuing in a supermarket at Christmas. We were very disappointed as we were so looking forward to our night away",1,2020,01,11
228,Excellent Location to 3Arena,"Booked to stay at this hotel as myself and my 2 guests were attending an event at the 3Arena. The hotel was spotless clean, modern and very warm and comfortable. The beds are on the small size (small double bed) but kinda expected in a city centre hotel. The staff were friendly and we paid a decent price for hotel location and time of year. It is a pity that we had to pay a substantial figure to pay for the car park which was located at the back of the hotel (private car park). I definitely would return again.",5,2020,01,10
228,you need to prioritise what's important,"This was just ok overall. Many things were excellent and then not so excellent. The staff were pretty good, better explanation of the car at check-in/out would have been good. Every other hotel we've stayed with or without their own private car park, we have paid the hotel, Here, you do NOT, you get your ticket validated like everywhere else  so you get the 50% discount, but then you pay in the car park pay station.  The rooms were quiet enough, you do expect some noise at a city centre hotel,  so far so good. Rooms and beds are tiny, we are not pencils however we are not large either. The double is a small double and a standard single with no where to swing a cat,  we weren't spending much time in our room so you get over that. The water pressure is dreadful, maybe because we were the very end of the corridor & no undertile heating.We were cold, even with the aircon on and the restaurant/bar was also on the chilly side before the portable rads were turned on. So on the upside, this would be the best hotel for convenient and enough USB & power points, this is a major plus when travelling,  Location is also surprisingly good, the footbridge across the road makes a 30min stroll into Stephen's Green, buses to Swords etc out the front & the LUAS out the back. And of course the IFSC & Point closeby, restaurant is reasonably priced so plenty of pluses with this hotel.   ",3,2020,01,10
228,The Gallavanters on tour,"Spent 2 nights pre Christmas at this very centrally located hotel on the Luas line. Highlights of our stay included excellent food ,great staff, warm and comfortable sorroundings, clean room, comfortable beds.",5,2020,01,10
228,Great experience,This property and the people were wonderful. We appreciated all of the kind people. We loved how the room was set up. We loved all the recommendations provided to us. I would highly recommend this property again.,5,2020,01,09
228,A bit expensive for a Hilton Garden Inn but worth it,"The hotel is centrally located and walking distance to most of Dublin's sites, Dublin's Castle, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College, St. Stephen's Green, etc. The Hop on Hop Off bus stops right in front and the 757 airport bus does too. The hotel is well maintained and staff is very friendly. We did not try the restaurant since there are so many other interesting and fun places to try just down the street. The fitness center was clean and had the basics which was good enough for my brief stay there. I was surprised at the cost for one night. This is a Hilton Garden and it was more expensive than a night at the Hilton Hotel which is located just on the other side of town. Perhaps due to location it is more expensive. All in all a nice stay.",4,2020,01,07
228,My business trip to Dublin.,"I arrived to the hotel on the 30th of december for a short business stay.  After I arrived I send and email to the manager telling that as a travel agent I was travelling to see and feel their facilities.  Room was ok.  The first night we use the restraurant but the service was a 3/10.  Next morning breakfast was good.  On the next night we use again the restaurant for dinner with the same experience, poor.  ",2,2020,01,06
228,Dublin,"Great accessibility, 757 airlink bus stop right outside, also BigBus hop on hop off tour. 10-15mins walk to Trinity College, Stephens Street, Temple Bar, O’ Connell Street, Luas to Heuston station. Friendly service, clean comfortable rooms and nice breakfast. Nice bar. Definitely recommend staying here👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿",5,2020,01,06
228,Well located and modern,"I previously stayed here when it was a Jury’s Inn and they have done a great job upgrading everything about the hotel. Location is great within easy walking distance of most things in Central Dublin. The hotel is bright, modern, clean and all staff were great. A small gripe would be that the pillows were very soft and I would have liked if they had a choice of something more firm - these are usually in the wardrobe in some hotels. Other than that a recommended hotel.",5,2020,01,06
228,Beautiful room,We stayed for 1 night as we were attending a show in Bord Gais Theatre. Location was perfect we were within walking distance. And the Luas stop was also quite near. Decor in the hotel was beautiful. Our room was spacious and had a fridge bathroom spotless no complaints we were impressed. However breakfast was a let down the food was barely warm and staff looked uninterested and apart from the girl who greeted us coming into restaurant the others just looked like they were goin through the motions of work. The gluten free section was bare 1 roll and a scone and when i asked for some gluten free bread i was told its just whats there. I would definitely stay here again but just on a room only basis.,4,2020,01,06
228,"Convenient location, quiet rooms ","We were recommended this hotel by a family member who stayed here a few months before us. This hotel is in a great location. We walked to everything from the hotel including trinity college, the Dublin castle and the Guinness factory. Great restaurants surround the hotel- easy to get back to the hotel to freshen up and go back out for dinner not too far away. The spread for breakfast was excellent. We booked a room that included breakfast. Our only issue that couldn’t have been prevented was our first real night in the hotel, the air conditioning alarm went off in the middle of the night. Thankfully the front desk was able to move us to another room in the middle of the night for us to sleep. We did park a car at this hotel - parking garage a located in building directly behind the hotel, very easy to locate. ",4,2020,01,05
228,Good,"Standard Hilton Garden Inn. Room are spacious, clean and quiet.  Location is bit far away from city center and main attractions, about 20mins walk to Temple bar. The area feels a bit empty and isolated.  ",4,2020,01,03
228,Celebrating new year in Dublin with friends,"We arrived on December 29th as a party of 4 was checked in smoothly rooms were comfortable and clean,we would like to give a special mention and thankyou to Amy on reception she was so friendly and very helpful sharing lots of information of places to go and eat/drink near the hotel she marked various places on the map for us,the hotel is central to everything you could want, lots of facilities with in it aswell if wanted,we saw the new year in on the bridge which was great,all in all a super stay we loved every minute, would throughly recommend.",5,2020,01,02
228,Great place to stay,"We stayed their over Christmas and loved it.  Location was great, rooms were clean and staff was helpful.  THe restaurant was also very good.  I will definitely stay there again when I am back in Dublin.",5,2020,01,02
228,"Wonderful experience, great staff and exceptional value","Truly exceptional experience and service. Staff went out of their way to be accommodating to my family after a long, early morning flight. Location is great and the value is one of the best in the city. Walking distance to most attractions and tours. Breakfast was great and a take away option was available for early morning tours. Rooms were a good size and well appointed. We can not recommend this hotel enough. Thanks for a great stay!",5,2019,12,31
228,"Smart, modern hotel right by the river within easy walking distance of the centre. Excellent breakfast & great staff. ","29 Nov Hilton Garden Inn Dublin. Stayed here for 2 nights for a friend's big birthday. A cab ride from the airport (about £15/£20 if my memory is correct) takes you to the hotel which is in a nice, modern area by the river, about 15-20 mins nice walk into the very centre of the town, past the statues of starving people from the potato famine and over the halfpenny bridge. The hotel is bright, smart and modern and the rooms are immaculate and very comfortable. The shower is over the bath (not ideal) but it's pristine clean and modern. The bed is very comfortable and there's a table & chair as well as a desk. Room service is available but pricey (£20+ for a one course light lunch). Breakfast is extensive and excellent, with loads on the buffet plus someone doing omelettes and two waffle irons. The bar area (also used for seating for breakfast when it's busy) is good and they had enough staff to cater for any busy periods. I really liked this hotel and will happily recommend & return. ",5,2019,12,29
228,Great hotel on river front,"3 day mini break in Dublin and the hotel was brilliant 
Can’t fault it
Great value, excellent room. Tidy..clean..attentive staff
Great little bar 
The breakfast was excellent 
Will stay here again and recommend highly",5,2019,12,29
228,Weekend Break,"This hotel is situated right on the river front and every where is easily accessable  from it.The rooms are comfy and adequate.The food served was good even if restaurant does get a little busy at breakfast times but the staff are good at clearing away the plates.The only grumble was the bar staff whilst trying to get a drink in the evening preferred to talk amongst themselves instead on serving the growing amount of customers waiting to be served,I had to in the end rather loudly asked one if they intended serving, as this was my first night in the hotel decided there and then not to drink in the hotel bar on further nights and instead drink in one of the outside establishments during the rest of my stay.",4,2019,12,29
228,Perfect for short family stay in the capital,"Family of four stayed one night. Lovely comfy room and beds. Check-in staff ultra friendly, really nice, great with the kids. Very accessible, near Luas stop. Parkewd overnight in Heuston Station as traffic heavy on the quays, and travlled up by Luas. Room overlooked Jeannie Johnson and next door to Epic, the Emigrant Museum, which is worth a visit. One of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had, freshly cooked omelette, waffle maker etc. Would definitely recommend. All of the staff to be commended for being so friendly and pleasant",5,2019,12,26
228,Wanted a Costa Coffee  ,"Went inside as we saw a costa coffee from the outside
Only to be greeted by a girl barista that had a queue of 3 people PANIC!!! and didn’t seem to know what she was doing 
Then what I presume was the restaurant manager came over and asked if we had a reservation to which we said no we just wanted a coffee and seat for 10 minutes to get warm and as there was plenty of seat available thought this would have been possible 
NO you thought wrong we were told no only for guests if it had been full I could understand and would never have asked but there was plenty of seating 
Oh well Merry Christmas ",2,2019,12,25
228,Great location ,"A lovely modern hotel just a short walk from Bord Gais Theatre and also the shopping areas of the city. Room was very comfortable for three of us. It had tea/coffee making facilities, hairdryer, iron, toiletries, tv and mini fridge. We did not avail of breakfast but we did have a delicious evening meal at Oly’s restaurant onsite. Parking was directly behind the hotel in the IFSC car park on Commons Street. We booked and paid for in advance on line, €20 for 24 hours. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again.",5,2019,12,23
228,Great location,"The hotel is located in a great location with an easy walk to the fun spots in the area.  A nice Hilton property.  Good bar, friendly, helpful staff and a fantastic breakfast.  A good choice for a short stay in Dublin.",5,2019,12,16
228,Excellent,"The hotel was amazing. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious. And last the location was perfect for us as is it give minutes away from the 3 arena.",5,2019,12,16
228,Lunch in Oly's restaurant,"My friends and I had a get together lunch. We were looking for somewhere convenient to where each of us worked. We booked a table at Oly's restaurant in the Hilton Garden Inn on Custom House Quay, Dublin. The service was appalling! As we were all on working lunch breaks our time was limited. Those of us that arrived first put in our orders as we had to get back to work and as other arrived they put in theirs. No food came out until they had all the orders. One of my friends ordered pizza - this had not arrived nearly an hour later! She had to leave to return to work. She cancelled her order explaining that we had asked numerous times where it was and had been told it was on its way. They tried to blame the fact that we had ordered separately and that pizza takes a long time. She was one of the first to order! I had soup and had to ask for a spoon! We had to ask for condiments - one item at a time! We each paid for our own meal as we left. The final bill included items that had already been paid for! Fortunately the ones who had left and paid for theirs had left their receipts with final two.",1,2019,12,16
228,Good location not smack dab in center but walkable,Very easy to get to on airport bus and has everything one would expect  a garden inn. Clean. We had a room with a side view of the river and one with direct river view and not much difference. Has a coin operated laundry which could come in handy. We left very early in am so they arrange a van which showed up on time. Can not fault it even though elevator was broken they had a second one so not too bad.,5,2019,12,13
228,Stay somewhere else!!,"Just checked out after a 4 night stay for our Anniversary, most staff are pleasant but that's as warm as it gets, A few staff are just plain rude!! 
We booked a deluxe king river view room. We even had to ask for an additional chair (only 1 in room yet 2 guests)The room was ok but nothing to right home about, still trying to work out what was deluxe about it!! No little extras like a robe or slippers no extra little perks like cookies not even a bottle of water in rooms, probably cos they charge an  extortionate amount for them in reception. Didnt even recieve an offer of a refund for the 1 mornings prepaid breakfast we didnt have. Although it was mentioned on the booking that it was our Anniversary not even a complementary glass or fizz was offered. The only positive is the drinks are nicely chilled, probably because the aircon is ramped up on full blast n the bar area is as cold as the welcome & atmosphere.
We have stayed in hotels around the world (Hiltons included) This is the poorest. Would definitely not recommend and will not be returning. If you want a traditional irish welcome stay anywhere but here.",3,2019,12,13
228,"Good location, good room, poor service","The location of the Hilton Garden Inn is quite good, direct at the river, 5-10 minutes walk to shopping / bar center. The room is good, not that large but has everything you need. The reason why I only gave 3 points is that my shower had no water pressure at all. Washing long hair is not possible and even taking a normal shower is really time consuming. I reported that to the receiption as the have their ""Hilton Promise"" which I can say now is completely crap. So they didn´t fix anything (I´m even not sure if somebody had a look) and also didn´t offer me another room. So the Hilton Promise is more a Hilton Fail. So yeah, i can recommend the hotel, but the first thing you should do is to check the shower and ask directly for another room if you are not satisfied.",3,2019,12,12
228,Decent Business hotel,"Standard Hilton Garden Inn.   Easy online check in, had a room facing the river and main road but it was very quiet.  Not much of interest in the immediate area, 15 minute walk to Temple Bar. Didn't get to try the restaurant.",4,2019,12,11
228,Fabulous,"WOW...totally fabulous experience ...meets the high standards I expect from Hilton.

Check in was nice and easy, given all relevant info and more...lovely bright and clean lobby area

Had a wonderful room with a river view...again, all very clean and tidy

Laundry facilities were fabulous as was the gym

The only downside was final morning when I went down to breakfast at 6.30 to grab a quick breakfast before taking my taxi to leave at 650..,,to be met by a real grumpy girl  who was faffing with the bread arrangement and told me they were still closed and to wait.- even though the hot food was already laid out..then 1 minute later a friendly guy came and said not to worry to just go straight through and eat!!

Overall it is good location - 10 minute walk to O'Connell street and outside food venues if you didn't want to use the hotel restaurant - but that is reasonably priced and worth a try!

Would definitely stay here again - it was a great weekend stay

Keep up the great standards!",5,2019,12,05
228,"Great hotel, easy location, nice views","I stayed here as I was attending a conference at the Convention Centre a block or two down from the hotel. I was initially worried that it was far from other attractions and restaurants/pubs, but I was pleasantly surprised by how walkable the hotel was, even down to Temple Bar. There's a number of restaurants and pubs within a few minutes' walk (including some good craft beer places), and the hotel is right next door to the Epic emigration museum and across from the Jeanie Johnson ship, both attractions worth visiting.
The hotel itself is fresh and modern, nice comfortable furnishings, clean bathroom, good amenities, and  a decent sized shower too.
The breakfast at the hotel is fantastic, with heaps of selections on offer.
My room was river-facing, and being on a high floor, I had some great views of the Liffey and some nice sunrises and sunsets too.
The place is about 10--15mins walk to O'Connell St, and about 15--20 to Temple Bar, so it's very conveniently located regardless of your purpose of visit. 
There's parking next door for which the hotel has a discount, and everything during my stay was easy and convenient. I'd stay again, especially if I had anything at the convention centre.",5,2019,12,04
228,"Overall, amazing stay!","Friendly staff, clean room and the view was great!
My family and I even ate at the restaurant, which we don't usually do.
Oh man, we were not disappoint. My husband had the duck special. I had the soup and hama leek pie.",5,2019,12,03
228,Weekend Stop Over in Dublin,"Very friendly and new hotel in a decent location.  Close to the tram and a short distance work to the main shopping strip in Dublin.  Room was brand new and fitted out well ( TV, electronics, USB ports, blackout blinds etc.) with a lovely view of the waterfront.  Staff friendly and accommodating with a small shop with a selection of conveniences.  One small complaint - the bathroom exhaust fan runs constantly and whilst bathroom door is heavy and you don't really hear it - it could be annoying as a light sleeper.",4,2019,12,03
228,Excellent place,"The hotel is really nice and placed in a really central position. The staff is really friendly and polite, and always there to help you. The breakfast buffet is really various and I think the waffle maker is a plus. The room was really clean and comfy. Amenities were enough and of a good quality. ",4,2019,12,03
228,Dublin visit,"Very friendly, clean hotel with great location. I wish our stay was longer so we could enjoy the amenities of the hotel. Great restaurants and bars nearby. The room had a beautiful view of the river & city center. Really enjoyed our stay!",5,2019,11,28
228,Brief Interlude in Dublin,"We had an approximately 24-hour layover in Dublin while transiting from Spain to the US and decided to spend the time in town.  The hotel was very conveniently located.  It's relatively new and physically everything was in top shape.  The staff was very accommodating. 
 We've had better breakfasts, especially in European hotels, and the single bar of soap in the bathroom was an inconvenience. ",4,2019,11,26
228,Go to property for location but nowhere is good value in Dublin!,"Like this hotel as the location suits us and the accommodation is good for Dublin weekends. The staff are always lovely. Expensive for what you get but all hotels in Dublin are overpriced and rarely includes breakfast. We were given breakfast as an apology as we discovered on checkin that our pre paid booking had not been charged months earlier to our credit card which I found very irritating as you then had to budget again for it at over 200 a night. A nice gesture thank you.

Beautiful big room with river view. Parking behind hotel but make sure you understand the rates as we got ripped off - hotel day 50% reduction but parking company say that’s misinformation and as customer you end up stuck between the two paying too much. Come on Hilton one of the worlds big hotel chains you can negotiate a better deal than that and be more more transparent. Left a bad taste in my mouth!!",4,2019,11,19
228,Well Done,"This hotel was awesome. The staff was outstanding, professional, friendly and always smiling. The rooms were great (size and amenities). The bed was so comfortable. Bathroom was good with handicap bars to get in and out of the shower/tub.
The breakfast buffet was outstanding.
The Oly Restaurant was great. 
I have absolutely no problem recommending this hotel and facilities.
",5,2019,11,16
228,Great hotel with pleasant staff and food,Great location and modern features. Excellent staff everywhere. Check in was very fast and pleasant despite arriving a bit early. Breakfast buffet was well stocked and great selections. And I found the price reasonable...,5,2019,11,13
228,"Great Staff, Great Location","I stayed at the Hilton the weekend of the 9th of November for two nights, I stayed with a child as we were attending WWE Live, the staff in the bar were very very friendly (unfortunately I didn't get names but the staff working the weekend of the 9'th) much nicer than in other hotels I have stayed in Dublin, which is a great bonus when you are travelling with a child who wants to order themselves and it is not an inconvenience. The room was very clean and everything worked perfectly, we didn't have breakfast as I felt it was expensive  €16 per person it did not specify a childs rate so I can only assume it was the same, It is not our first time staying here and I would recommend it for families especially if you are attending anything in the 3arena, there is no problem with you relaxing in the hotel after an event.",4,2019,11,12
228,Great location,We choose this hotel for its walking distance to Connolly Station. We parked our vehicle at the hotel garage and made a day trip to Belfast. The hotel is very modern in design and a good value for hotels in Belfast.,5,2019,11,11
228,"Good Location, Clean and Comfy!","During the booking process thru Delta Vacations, the room description was less than stellar and no one could seem to give me much information about the room itself. (Even Hilton Res couldn't tell me much)  Anyway, I arrived in the evening November 2nd after a rather long day of travel and found that t room had one queen bed rather than 2 doubles. Knowing this property sells out nightly I asked if there was any changes that could be made at some point during my 5 night stay that would allow me two beds. The desk associate I was dealing with, Amy, came to the rescue without hesitation!!  She did some checking, made a call and BAM! Changes were in the air. Amy managed to get a roll-a-way into the existing room and promised to have a different room ready the next day. Sunday morning I took off to explore the area and returned a few hours later to find that the room had been changed and all of my belongings had been moved to the new room. And, what a great room it was! Amy is a shining example of customer service at it peak! Not only did she take great care to make things better, she did it with a smile and positive attitude. She also bent over backwards to provide information about all sorts of stuff to see and do during my visit. 

Now for the bad....The dining experiences at the hotel dining room were not quite as nice. Although the food quality and taste were good, the service left a LOT to be desired. I'd go so far as to say that perhaps the food and beverage manager should probably be in another field of employment. The staff in Oly's never seemed to be in sync. One would wait on us (after an extensive wait when it was not busy) then another would would bring food...yet another would bring the bill after flagging them down. My ratting of Very Good could have been higher if it had not been for the terrible dining at the property.",4,2019,11,08
228,Senior Citizens,"Whilst down at a concert decided to have dinner in the restaurant!! The staff were very pleasant and helpful, immediate service and the food was presented hot from a comprehensive menu. The surroundings were comfortable. The only reservation having asked twice for a flat white coffee was presented with just a milky froth not a flat white!! However would certainly eat there again.",4,2019,11,06
228,Excellent location for 3 Arena,Excellent location for attending the recent Cher concert. An easy walk from the hotel to the venue. Hotel staff were very obliging and helpful particularly when breakfast should have been over but they continued to serve us,4,2019,11,06
228,Wow wow wow,I couldn't fault the place. From easy access parking to the nicest receptionist Amy. She was smiley and bubbly from the moment we walked in. A small shop in the lobby from sandwiches and crisps and a coffee machine. The room was so clean we stayed in one with a large single and a queen bed it was a well lite room with plugs each side of the bed. The bathroom was so clean. The staff were so polite. Only issue I had was the 19euro I had to pay for the parking which I think is very expensive when I paid nearly 200euro for one night and no breakfast included. If you wanted breakfast it was an a extra €16 and these are the only reason I marked it down to 4 stars.,4,2019,11,05
228,Stayed here for 2nyts,"Brilliant hotel, stayed here when it was a jury's, no comparison.  The hilton group have really made there mark with this property.  Ideal property for concerts, quick hop into town on the luas.  Great service, value for money and warm friendly staff. ",5,2019,11,05
228,Hilton Garden Inn Custom House,"We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The rooms were clean, staff were friendly and helpful when asking directions, and the breakfast was great. Would certainly stay again when visiting Dublin.",5,2019,11,04
228,Dependable Hotel in great area,"Never disappointed at this hotel.
Rooms well kept and staff always attentive.
Breakfast is well rounded with everything you could want to eat.
Come every year for the Dublin Marathon and will continue!",4,2019,11,03
228,Lovely place to stay,We stayed for three nights. The beds are very comfy and the pillows too. Everything you want from a good hotel. The staff are friendly and the breakfast has a large range of food on offer. We also saw Cher just down the road. The concert was brilliant and the location of this hotel is perfect.  I highly recommend visiting the EPIC museum about 3 minutes up the road.,4,2019,11,03
228,Fine stay,"HGI Custom house was fine. The rooms were well  appointed, but the lobby was small and the restaurant less than great. Additionally the 'included breakfast' was not worth it in any way. They served waffles, but ran out of syrup and most other toppings. The service was terrible as they were very busy.",3,2019,11,03
228,Comfortable rooms in a well located hotel,"Spent 4 nights in a queen room at the Garden Inn Custom House. The room was comfortable and clean but not particularly big. The bed was comfortable too and made for a good night's sleep. The hotel is well located for the centre of Dublin and the conference centre a like.  Breakfast buffet is excellent with delicious sausages. I ordered lunch in the restuarant too but that wasn't great, however. My only gripe was the fact that I reported that the desk lamp wasn't working and it wasn't fixed during my stay. There are more characterful places to stay in Dublin and closer to the city, but if you're visiting the conference centre, this isn't a bad option.",4,2019,11,02
228,"Very good hotel, friendly efficient staff","The staff were friendly, polite and efficient and nice to see Irish people working on the front desk. 
Room and bathroom were large, modern, clean with a lovely view over the river, city and the Dublin hills in the distance. Beds very comfortable. 
Only thing I didn’t like the complementary shampoo and conditioner. Shampoo left my hair knotty and the conditioner was very thick and struggled to get out of the bottle. Have had better in other hotels. Minor point but would recommend hotel.",4,2019,11,01
228,"Clean, comfortable and convenient","Stayed late October 2019.  Hotel still has that ‘new’ feel with all the fixtures and fittings in very good shape.  Room was quiet and comfortable for the 2 nights I stayed - and even though I was working in the room until late lunchtime one day, my room was still serviced by the time I got back.  The rooms are well appointed with USB sockets by the desk and both sides of the bed.  The only negative I found about my top floor room was that the water pressure in the shower was a bit low.
Given the location, the hotel is a busy place, but I wasn’t disturbed by any noise - the only time I really noticed was when waiting to get served at the bar.
Overall, a very good hotel, only a €6 taxi from Temple Bar - although there are also some great restaurants just around the corner.
I’d definitely come back",4,2019,11,01
228,Family trip,"Stayed here last night with my wife and teenage daughter. Great location easy walking distance of bus and rail stations. Short walk to OConnell St. Good clean room, friendly staff. Bar area not great would recommend you try elsewhere. Standard buffet breakfast of good quality. Shower not great and poorest flush of a toilet i have come across. Overall quite good and great location. I would use it again and i would recommend it to a friend.",4,2019,10,31
228,"Comfortable hotel, nice and quiet,","Comfortable hotel, nice and quiet, all major attractions in walking distance (if you liek to walk). Airport bus stop in front of the hotel, very convenient. Clean and excellent breakfast buffet. Employees are dedicated, very friendly and helpfull.",4,2019,10,30
228,"great hotel, friendly staff and good food","Great hotel located in on walking distance from all major places in the city. Staff is friendly, rooms are great and clean. Although the frness area is relatively small, the equipment is up 2 date and clean. I would recommend it to everyone who visits Dublin. Business or pleasure. ",5,2019,10,30
228,Awesome hotel and friendly staff,"Stayed at Hilton Garden Inn during my first trip to Dublin and now I have become a regular visitor. The hotel has state of the art amenities, great location and a fantastic breakfast buffet. The staff are extremely nice and friendly. Special thanks to Alex Manciu, Lucas and Sarah for being so caring. Will definitely visit again.",5,2019,10,30
228,Amazing hotel,"Great hotel, good room facilities and amazing food!
The manager Mr Sushil helped me with all the arrangements and it was one of my best day in Dublin!

I had chickpea burger and also a few pints of Guinness! 
Service was too notch!
",5,2019,10,28
228,Awesome location,Great hotel perfectly situated to go to city center Dublin or just to explore. Right on the river. Clean big room. Convenient for getting a taxi or eating at any of the numerous restaurants in the area.,5,2019,10,27
228,Great hotel,"We spent the second half of our visit to Dublin at this hotel and I highly recommend it! They were so great about giving us a water view, extending our stay, cleaning our room even when we left late. Staff is really nice also. Within walking distance of lots of stuff and right next door to Emigration Museum.",5,2019,10,25
228,"Great location, professional staff nice room facing the Liffey River","Just behind the hotel you have the George’s Dock Red Line tram stop bringing you in few minutes to downtown Dublin. Another advantage is the annexed car park (even if expensive), thanks to the hotel location and the M50 tunnel you arrive at the airport in approx. 20 min.
Nice room, Hilton standard. Professional staff, both at the front desk as well at Breakfast. Great breakfast selection. We enjoyed here a nice last day of our two weeks’ vacation exploring the southern part of this beautiful island.",4,2019,10,24
228,If you need a decent gym in Dublin,"Solid US hotel brand w good amenities and a great gym for those who need/want to exercise each day.  Breakfast buffet is pretty good too, staff friendly and knowledgeable - location perfect. Don’t miss EPIC - which is next door, it’s worth the visit. ",5,2019,10,24
228,Small Rooms but nice and clean,"Apparently was in a deluxe room - was pretty small and felt cramped with two people, shower wasn't brilliant but overall high standards of cleanliness - would stay again.
Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that.",4,2019,10,23
228,Wonderful Stay.  Great Breakfast.  Centrally located.,"Visiting our daughter, we stayed at the HGI Dublin.  The stay was wonderful.  The breakfast was well done, plentiful and free.  There is also an restaurant on site and a full service bar.  Walking distance to most of the tourist areas and a tourist bus stop is right outside the hotel.  The staff, especially Mr Issamdine Sekhairia and Mr Cameron (at the bar) were fantastic.  Both are friendly, professional and full or suggestions for visiting the area.    Most definitely a place to give a shot and we look forward to our next stay.  Hope this helps.",5,2019,10,21
228,Great visit,"We didn't know it when we booked it, but the Hilton Garden Inn was one of the places we stayed at 16 years ago during our first visit to Dublin, but then it was a Drury Inn!  Definitely the surroundings have changed a lot since then (a lot more built up, and a lot more places to see and do.....16 years ago, we had trouble finding a place for a cup of coffee!  Lol).  This place is now only steps from a light rail stop, providing access to most of Dublin right from the hotel!

The hotel of course has been redone since then, and it was redone very nicely.  The rooms are modernized, and very comfortable.  The bar was remodeled, too, but I'm on the fence about that...it's very much an open, modern feeling now, as opposed to the more traditional Irish pub feel from 16 years ago. The staff here, though, as expected, was fantastic, and friendly.  The breakfast buffet here was extensive, and had a lot of traditional Irish Breakfast options for everyone.  

Overall, this was a great stay, and provided for a great base to explore the whole of Dublin from.",4,2019,10,21
228,On the whole good,"We arrived at midnight to find the car park locked.   Once they went to open it our car was too big Volvo with roof box.   Car was left at front of hotel overnight and parked at another off site car park in the morning 

Breakfast was good and kept topped up.   Nice little shop in hotel lobby for snacks and essentials 

Main let down was the evening meal service was not brilliant, started to clear plates while members of the party were still eating, forgot one of our drink orders, were rushed to order desert even though one of the party was still eating then we had to hunt down staff to place the order.   Even managed to get 2 kids desserts wrong, ( vanilla ice cream).  

The food was ok but the service was such a let down.  Staff were even seen taking about our table !!!  

Check out was great no problems at all

I would stay here again as it is a great location, but I would not eat here other than breakfast",4,2019,10,21
228,They don’t honor room choice when checking in,"When you check in online you are given the option to choose your room ahead of time from the floor plan. Personally, I am pretty noise sensitive so I love this feature. I chose a room as far away from the elevators as possible. 

Upon arriving at the hotel they assign me a different room than the one I picked. I figured it would be fine but I get up there and my room is about 3 meters away from the elevators. It DIRECTLY faces them and is the closest you could possibly get - which is the exact scenario I was trying to avoid. 

I realize how loud this is going to be so I head back down to the front desk. Guy tells me there are zero other rooms to switch me to and “your room choice when checking in is not guaranteed”. Okay? Why even offer that option if you are not going to honor it? Kind of ridiculous especially since I have Hilton status.

Other than that, the room and hotel was fine. Nothing bad, nothing spectacular. ",3,2019,10,21
228,Enjoyable stay,"Nice atmosphere, very good location, walking distance to the city centre, bus stop just on the street behind the hotel.
Reception staff was nice, just bear in mind, if you have to leave early in the morning the coffee machine is out of order...",5,2019,10,20
228,"Good location, very quiet room.","The hotel is located a short walk from the Samuel Beckett Bridge on the north side of the Liffey. It's a short 5 minute walk to both the bus station and Connolly train station. If the gate in the rear isn't locked you can walk out the rear door to walk one block to the George's Dock Luas stop. Otherwise you can walk through the Epic to the Luas platform.  It's also just a 10 - 15 minute walk to Trinity College, Grafton St, and Temple Bar. There are also a few food markets (M&S, Spar, Fresh) within a couple of minutes walk of the property. Getting to and from the airport is simple too. The 757 Airlink stops right by the hotel. Note that some maps still list this location as the Jurys Inn.

We had a Queen Family room which had 2 queen beds. It was more than enough room for a family of 4. The bed was a bit hard for my liking but my wife found it wonderfully perfect. The HVAC kept the room comfortable cool at night and warmed up as desired during the day. The digital controls allowed the temperature to go down to 16C. The windows also open if you want fresh air. However with them closed, the windows offer great sound insulation from any street noise.

All in all, clean, comfortable and nicely located.",4,2019,10,20
228,A very good hotel!,"The hotel is located in an excellent location. It has at the entrance the bus station at the airport and tour buses. the rooms are large, spacious. The hotel is very clean, the staff is friendly. Excellent breakfast.",4,2019,10,19
228,Great stay!,"Just back from an overnight trip to Dublin to attend a concert at the 3 Arena.  Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn on Custom House Quay.  Fabulous hotel. 15 minute walk to the Arena.   Extremely clean and comfortable with very friendly, efficient staff.  Big thumbs up for the breakfast.  I have stayed in 5 star hotels that couldn't turn out a breakfast like that!  We had a double room to accommodate our son with us.  It was huge and configured well with  his double bed tucked around a corner. Honestly, I know some Garden Inns can be fairly basic, but this one certainly isn't.  Excellent hotel!",5,2019,10,18
228,Very comfortable stay,"A clean, well-built and very quiet hotel.  The room windows can open and we were surprised how much street noise there was that we didn't hear at all when the windows were closed.  Comfortable beds.  Pleasant,  helpful and friendly staff.  Extensive breakfast buffet, including made-to-order omelets along with everything else you'd look for.  The shuttle bus to the airport stops just outside the front door; the EPIC museum is next door.  We were very pleased with our stay.",4,2019,10,17
228,WAAAAAY too expensive !!!!!,"I love Hilton hotels, we are Hilton honours gold members (not a boast, just to show we always use Hilton). We specifically chose a 'DELUXE' room for a 2 night stay and I am baffled by the description (dictionary description is: notably luxurious, elegant, or expensive ) well they certainly got the expensive right. We paid £450 GBP for a room on the 6th floor and an extra €38 for parking. Room was clean, and well finished, beds left both, myself and my wife sore the next morning, they may need updated. All round the hotel was fine, but it is a standard 3 star hotel so dont be fooled by the 'DELUXE' rooms, I would say save a bit of money and stick to the standard rooms. Will I return, not a chance at that price !",3,2019,10,16
228,Wonderful place to rest,"We’ve been there for 4 days. Beautiful, clean rooms wich are well equipped. The staff are realy kind and professional, they gladly help you in everything. The restorant /bar makes delicious food and isn’t too expensive. Absolutely recommended category!
",5,2019,10,16
228,Perfect for ferries,"This busy hotel is perfectly placed for quick access to all the ferries to UK. The rooms are new, spotlessly clean and although small are well designed with excellent bathrooms. Air con really works and the window opens. Walking distance to central Dublin. Why look elsewhere? Except perhaps for the food offering which we found uneatable. Needs urgent and basic reform.",4,2019,10,16
228,Good location for this hotel,"The Hilton Garden Inn Custom House in Dublin is in a good location for what we needed it for - an event at the Convention Center Dublin, which is only a few blocks away, along the river.  The hotel was a reasonable example of a Hilton Garden Inn.
For transit, the hotel is right near bus stops for regular buses, as well as airport buses.
The historic CHQ building is literally right next door, with a variety of different eateries and shops, plus the EPIC Irish Emigration museum.  At the back of that building (call it a block) is the Georges Dock stop of the LUAS tram system, which made it easier to get around if you wanted to go further than just walking, like to The Point in one direction, and most of the city, such as O'Connell Street, in the other.",4,2019,10,15
228,"Comfortable, clean, convenient","Comfortable, clean hotel.  My room faced out over the road outside next to the Liffey, but soundproofing was good, so river-facing rooms weren't loud.  Comfortable bed, clean room.  Bathrooms were a little tired, but clean and perfectly functional.  Great breakfast (although the breakfast room is huge and very busy), and pleasant restaurant and bar. Small fitness room with weights and cardio equipment.",4,2019,10,14
228,Comfortable hotel,"The hotel provided easy and efficient service from reception onwards. The room was a standard Queen room and was adequate with plenty of room. Only disappointment was the plastic shower curtain - creepy and yuk. 
The hotel is sited right next to the EPIC which is a quite interssting museum on Emmigration if you are from America or Australia. Nice pub across the Samuel Becket bridge - The Ferryman - ask for a Smithwicks Special - red ale with a top of Guiness - delicious. Plenty of restaurants nearby. 
Bit of a walk to the city but the bonus was a very quiet room with a sound sleep at night.",4,2019,10,14
228,Great Location,"Fantastic location right next to the Epic exhibition and overlooking the Liffey. We originally had a standard double but got an email a few days before offering an upgrade to a river facing king room for about €20 per night extra. I went for it. The room was a decent size (number 435) and has a front and corner view of the river right over the Jeannie Johnstone sailing ship. Worth it? In my opinion, no; purely on the size of the windows and room set up - you basically have to stand right up at the window to enjoy the view. 
The staff were very friendly and efficient on arrival and throughout. We didn’t eat at the hotel. It’s a 10 minute walk to O’Connell St, 20 minute to Grafton St. 
To get there from the airport, the green airport bus 757 has a stop right outside the hotel; €7 pp for the single journey.",4,2019,10,13
228,Fabulous Hotel,"Lovely hotel, within walking distance to amenities including the 3arena. The food in the bar is really good & we couldn’t fault the service. Breakfast is excellent value with plenty to choose from. The hotel is family orientated as well which is a plus. Our room was a generous size and the beds were so comfy. Really nice decor too. We would stay again.",4,2019,10,12
228,Great Location but pricy,"This is a typical Hilton Garden Inn.  Great location.  Behind the hotel is the rail transit system that can take you around the city.  Out front of the hotel is the bus stop that also has several ""jump on, jump off"" tour buses that stop.  I highly recommend if sightseeing.  Breakfast was good but expensive at 16 euros. It is a buffet so you can fill up and skip lunch.  Service was great and I would stay here again.",4,2019,10,12
228,Great as always.,"Nice hotel in a walking distance from all the important places in Dublin. Nice staff and like always great food. There is a parking just behind the hotel, just a little bit to expensive. Ask the reception to for the parking discount.",5,2019,10,09
228,"Lovely staff, clean and modern hotel","I only stayed at the Hilton for one night (before a tour) and overall was really happy. It’s not luxury, but is a really decent three star hotel - it’s clean and modern. I was exhausted by the time I arrived and so enjoyed looking out at the beautiful views of the river, having a relaxing bath and ordering room service (the linguine was brilliant)! 

The team on the front desk were lovely and really helpful! 

",4,2019,10,09
228,Pretty good,"My stay did not start well when after a 17 hour series of flights, my room was not yet ready. This did give me a chance to use the bar for a Guinness or two and to watch the rugby international versus Wales. 

All in, a well located hotel, easy walk to the Convention Centre and similar simple walk to the main sights of the city. 

Nice and clean, decent breakfast offerings. ",4,2019,10,03
228,Expensive and basic,"Good location. Basic hotel that is not under the Hilton standards, asked for pair of slippers and bath robe and they said they are not available for this property. No dental/saving kits. They said that they can be purchased at the lobby shop. The room was very small/compact. Very plane bathroom.Average service. The gym is very basic. ",2,2019,10,03
228,Below average lunch,"Had lunch here as part of our visit to the Epic Musuem in Dublin.  A limited menu and not everything on the limited menu was available.  The atmosphere was cold, the food below par, and the experience worth forgetting.  There are plently of better eating places within walking distance, so don't waste your Euros here.  Very corparate.  Very cold.  Very disappointing.",2,2019,10,02
228,Great B&B deal!,"Had 3 nights at a substantial discounted bed and breakfast rate for public sector staff (which I didn't know Hilton Hotels Group did). I was very impressed at this competitive rate and this was the main reason I booked with Hilton Garden Inn. The booking process had lots of problems initially due to the booking app we used + applying the offer due to broken online links, but all got sortes eventually. However in spite of the initial teething problems was worth it.
The Hotel over looks the river and sits next door to the E.P.I.C Irish immigration museum in a great location. The hotel was was a 10min ride to the ferry port on one side and 10-15 minute walk to Temple Bar/shopping district on the other. On the hotel's doorstep was the taxi drop off and a few bus stops. Which inclused airport buses and all the major Dublin hop-on hop-off city tour companies picking up from just outside the hotel door. However we were happy to stetch our legs each day just so that we could walk off our huge buffet breakfast. 
Breakfast had an impressive selection for all tastes and served until 11am on weekends & 10am on weekdays. The breakfast set up consisted of 4 breakfast bars with the European continental selection with meats/cheese's along with fresh yoghurt and fresh fruit. A breakfast bar with soda + sliced breads/rolls/croissants/mini pastries + evan scones. The usual selection of hot/cold drinks and juices. Also a waffle bar, cooked to order all freshly prepared and literally the size of your plate. Finally the cooked breakfast bar with all the usual cooked breakfast options.
The hotel had also had a mini shop counter (by main reception) to purchase drinks/snacks few toiletries. If fancy a night cap or evan a coffee was open until 01:30 and even served cocktails but at the usual hotel bar prices so a little pricey.
Staff couldn't be more helpful and courteous, even extending my offer when we decided to stay an extra night in Dublin.
All room was modern, clean, with en suite shower rooms, with a safe / fridge / ironing board / hairdrier / tea making facilities all included. Also have to say I don't think the Hotel was full by any means but the rooms appeared to be very quiet to both outside noise and from other guests. Would happily stay again.
",5,2019,10,02
228,Great location!,"We stayed here for a weekend trip to Dublin and found a great deal for this good location. The hotel was in a really good location, being a relatively short walk to the Temple Bar area, short drive (20 or so minutes to the airport) and the room was clean and spacious. 

I only have 2 complaints. The first is that the check-in time isn't until 3 in the afternoon, which is somewhat disappointing after arriving from the US on a 7 hours flight. Naturally, the room was not ready, so we had to change in a bathroom and have the hotel store our luggage while we explored for the day. They did however end up moving us to a slightly better room with a river view for the price of the non-river view. The second complaint is that the mattress was entirely uncomfortable. I've stay in many Hilton-branded hotels around the world, but have never had such a hard/firm/board-like/uncomfortable mattress.

Overall, the hotel was good for its location and the staff was courteous. I'd likely stay here again.",4,2019,09,30
228,Great location and great stay,"We had a short time in the city, so were only there a couple of nights, but were very pleased with our stay. The location is great – right on the riverfront and at a stop of the Hop-on-hop-off bus tour. It’s also not a long walk from the hotel to most attractions. Our room was a decent size and clean. We also ordered room service for dinner which was quick and good. The included breakfast also had a good variety to start our day. If we return to the city, we would stay again.",5,2019,09,29
228,"Great location, great views, clean and modern",Came here because the sites recommended to me were fully booked.  But I'm glad I did.  The hotel's outside appearance doesn't fit too well with Dublin tradition but the location was within walking distance of everything I needed and and the staff were friendly and helpful.  I'll certainly stay here again.,5,2019,09,28
228,Good location and a good hotel,"Located just a short walk from the convention center and with a view of the river, this hotel is very conveniently located. It is only about a 10 minute walk to the city center. 

The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet, even though I had a room overlooking the river and the road.

The breakfast buffet was good and there was plenty of seating. In the evening the location is also a restaurant and bar. Nothing special but fine for a nightcap.

The gym was small, but functional. There were two treadmills, 2 cross trainers and some dumbbells. 

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The whole hotel was clean and in God shape. I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again if I needed to be close to the convention center.",4,2019,09,27
228,Great hotel.,"Stayed in a river view room twice in September 2019.

Great hotel. Comfortable beds, nice linen, curtains seal out the light nicely, and quiet despite being on a fairly busy road (my lower floor room had triple glazing, the one on the higher floor had double-glazing).

Handy location - around 10 mins walk to Tara St Station or O’Connell Street, and maybe 15 mins walk to Temple Bar. There’s not a whole lot immediately around the hotel, other than a couple of cafes and a brewery though. The Airlink bus arrives/departs right in front of the hotel which is very handy.

Excellent service - I had a problem with the TV antenna in my room, which was fixed within 10 minutes. Very impressive.

Will definitely stay there again when next visiting Dublin.",5,2019,09,26
228,Optimum!,"A great hotel!
Good location, good rooms, great breakfast, great bar area and restaurant and good service level. 
My preferred Dublin accommodation with a view over the Liffey river and within walking distance to both Temple Bar area, shopping, 3 Arena and lots of good restaurants. 

",5,2019,09,25
228,First stay since rebranded as a Hilton,"Excellent facilities, customer service and dining. Fabulous location for access to 3 Arena. Highly recommend for anyone but especially for 3 Arena. Travelled with 3 teenage girls and there was pizza available until midnight after the show. ",5,2019,09,24
228,Normal stay.,The hotel was just what you would expect from a Hilton. It was a typical & average stay. Our only complaint is the bed was so hard and uncomfortable. We have never complained of a bed but this was like sleeping on a rock. ,4,2019,09,23
228,lovely stay,We stayed fro two nights over my 50th birthday trip to Ireland.  Very clean room with a lovely view of the river.  Room was very clean & hotel in a good location to most attractions.  The Hop On & Off Bus stop is right outside the door.  Had the breakfast one morning and found that on the pricey side ,5,2019,09,23
228,Fantastic experience ,"We recently stayed at the Hilton for part of our holiday to the UK. We picked this hotel because it was a pick up point for the Game of Thrones tour. 

The staff from the front desk to the manager at the restaurant were very friendly. The food selection was perfect!!!",5,2019,09,21
228,Extremely helpful and friendly staff,"We stayed overnight at this hotel, upon arrival they were friendly and expedient. That night I tripped over a utility cover that was broken on a sidewalk. The staff was extremely helpful, getting ice and trying to help me find a private clinic to go to. ",5,2019,09,21
228,Perfect ending to a wonderful trip,"We stayed here for one night after a cruise.  The staff was excellent. My husband is a diabetic and they kept the ice packs froze for us. They knew us by name and arranged for a taxi to the airport. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Dublin, Ireland!!!",5,2019,09,17
228,Great Location,Lovely room overlooking the River Liffey.  Very good location not far from 3 Arena and just a short walk across the river to the Bord Gais Theatre.   Luas stop just round the corner if you don't feel like walking!,5,2019,09,17
228,Happy with this hotel selection,"After EXHAUSTIVE research, and with many thanks to fellow hotel reviewers on TA, I selected this hotel for our 3-night stay in Dublin, and overall was very pleased with the selection.

+ Hotel offers rooms with 2 US Queen beds, which I found was a tall order in Dublin;
+ Rooms have real central Air Conditioning, that worked beautifully (another hard-to-find amenity in Dublin);
+ Convenient parking garage attached to hotel, which is validated by hotel for 50% off;
+ Location overlooking River Liffey was beautiful, and just steps away from the busier, noisier parts of Dublin; no street traffic noise was heard in our room, especially since we did not have to open the windows to make the room comfortable;
+ Hop On/Hop Off buses for three different tour companies had a stop in front of the hotel;
+ Hotel had a very up-to-date feel in decor, etc.;
+ Convenient restaurant (Oxy's) in hotel had good menu offerings;
+ Interacted with various staff at front desk during our stay and they were always very friendly & helpful

CONS:
- Could not use our US credit card to pay for parking b/c machine required a PIN, (which to my knowledge, we only use for debit cards in the US). I could not get the machine to give me back my ticket or credit card, which freaked me out. Luckily there was a button to push for customer service and I didn't have to wait too long on hold for a live person to explain the situation. He said ""Are you from the US? Yes, we get this problem a lot."" Well, then it might be worth posting something to that effect on the machine!
- For some crazy reason, the cost for booking each night individually was coming up at a cheaper rate than booking a 3-night stay for the same dates. For a two Queen Family  room, the Honors Semi-Flex Rate was: Night 1 - 227.09 euro; Night 2 - 250.49 euro; Night 3 - 250.49 euro for an avg. of 242.69/night. When I then went to book for all three nights, (same room type, same semi-flex rate), it came up as 276 euros/night!! I called Hilton and the Rep. said she had never seen anything like this, and had no explanation. She VERY Kindly offered to book the nights at the individual rates posted on the website (she had to book each night individually), but then she linked all three reservations together, so we would not have to check out & in each day. All went fine when we showed up at the hotel except we did have to get our room keys re-keyed each day. This nonsense is the main reason I docked this hotel a star in my rating. It makes no sense to charge customers a higher per night rate for staying more nights!
- Minor nit at check out, when I checked the bill and noticed that a tip for dinner at Oly's had been charged twice. It was promptly removed without issue.
- We did have an experience where a member of the housekeeping staff did not honor our ""Do Not Distub"" sign, and tried to enter the room, (but could not b/c of the safety bar). I opened the door and her cart was there, but she was nowhere to be seen. Also, our sign was no longer on our doorknob, even though it had been there within the hour that we had re-entered our room. I noticed it on top of her cart and put it back on our door knob. Our room was the last one at the end of a hallway, so I don't think it likely that someone goofing around pulled it off. When she re-emerged, I had a few words with her.

But those things aside, overall a very positive experience, and happy with my selection of this hotel for our Dublin visit.",4,2019,09,15
228,River Liffey,"The location was great across the river from the temple bar area. Got to explore niche neighborhoods. The pickup outside front door was very convenient to and from airport. 
Very walkable to everything Dublin!",3,2019,09,12
228,Good rooms and convenient location for conference,"Stayed here for 4 days for a conference at the Convention Centre just a short walk away. Room was spacious, clean, reasonably well-lit and had many USB ports (convenient since I forgot my adaptor!). Friendly and helpful staff and a nice bar/lounge area.  No good coffee options on site however (instant in the room- horrors!). It’s a convenient and dunce choice for any event at the CCD. ",4,2019,09,10
228,"Clean, classy and comfortable ","I stayed in the Hilton garden inn for two weeks. 

The room was spacious with a very comfortable bed, gorgeous bathroom that had a shower with good strong water pressure and hot water at any time! My room was cleaned and bed dressed every day for the duration of my stay. 

There is access to their gym on site which was small but had enough equipment to make use of. It was very nice to have it so convenient to use. 

Each morning I had the breakfast and have to say enjoyed it every morning. There was a full selection from a fry to fruit and pastries. There was a chef there to cook eggs fresh to order! 

All the staff were extremely pleasant when checking in and checking out, and they held onto my bags after checkout for the day for no extra charge! ",5,2019,09,09
228,"Nice hotel, well situated","We stayed here while attending a convention at the convention center, which was a short walk from the hotel.  If one wishes to use public transportation, the LUAS stops out back of the hotel and can take you all over town.  If you want to lay in snacks or drink, there is a SPAR store about a block away.

There is a tall ship docked in the river outside the front of the hotel; the ship is a historical museum and well worth a visit.  Out the back of the hotel, near the LUAS stop, is the EPIC Irish Emigration Museum, also well worth a visit.  All in all, the location of the hotel is outstanding!

The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, professional, and very helpful.  The rooms are quite clean, and the housekeeping service does an excellent job.  One nice touch -- the hotel has washcloths in the room, which seems not to be the case in many Irish hotels but was very welcome to us.

The breakfast has a nice variety, and includes a made-to-order omelette station.  We were quite satisfied with the breakfasts.  When not in use for breakfasts, the space is a restaurant with great food and generous portions.

This is a very nice hotel.   

The rooms were very comfortable for a hotel of this class,",5,2019,09,08
228,Excellent. ,"Excellent stay at Hilton Garden Inn Dublin. Room, staff, facilities, everything at the highest standards. Perfectly located if you visit Dublin for a meeting or conference at Dublin Conference Center. ",5,2019,09,08
228,Comfortable room for a long stay,"We enjoyed our stay during a conference at the CCD.  The room has many convenient power outlets with USB. The bathroom has washcloths and several shelves to keep your toiletries on.  There was ample closet space, and three small drawers for clothes.  The room had a safe and refrigerator and a kettle to heat water.
There is a guest laundry on site.  You buy tokens on the desk for one load of washing and drying for 7 euros, very reasonable and convenient.
It is convenient to the Airport Express bus.  also the LUAS tram.",5,2019,09,07
228,Great Location Modern Hotel,"I could wax lyrical and in great detail about the hotel and the staff. However I’m not going to. As all you need to know is you can catch a bus from Dublin Airport to it. Don’t keep hire car or drive to it. 
The location is right on the Liffey and it’s short walk from tram stop, not far from The Point arena, easy walking distance into old town Dublin but situated in the new modern development. The hotel is stylish and modern so rooms are in good condition. Can’t review breakfast as we always just went out as there are so many places to choose from.",4,2019,09,07
228,Excellent stay,"Excellent hotel in a very good location, some museums right next door, 10 min on foot from National Gallery and lots of sites in the centre. Very helpful and attentive staff, a well-appointed, spacious and comfortable room. Would gladly stay again.",5,2019,09,04
228,5 Days of pleasure.,"Short break with family, to Dublin to check on place. Enjoyed every minute touring Dublin and surounding areas. Hotel was more than we expected, but parking whilst not a problem is in pubilc area, and a little expensive.",5,2019,09,04
228,Good clean hotel in an excellent location,"Chose this hotel due to location and proximity of easy parking. Hotel is a fairly standard business use/corporate type hotel but everything was clean and we had no major issues. Check in seemed a bit chaotic on the day we got there and the promised phone call when our rooms would be ready never arrived that was a minor issue in the grand scheme of things. Hotel is in a great location, pleasant 10 min walk along the river gets to you to all the central tourist attractions. 
Bus stop for hop on and off tour bus is right outside the hotel door. 
Never took option of breakfast in the hotel but did use the food area in the same building as the emigration museum beside the hotel which has multiple different food options",4,2019,09,02
228,Just the Omelette needs to improve ,"I was staying at this hotel alone for two nights in August.

The check-in was smooth and I had asked for a quiet room. I was given room 542. The room is at the end of a very pleasantly decorated and welcoming corridor. It was tranquil and just what I needed for the weekend.

As a Hilton honours guest I took my two bottles of water from the pantry area up to the room. I was able to put these into the mini bar fridge.

I opted for room service on the first day I was very surprised that there was a €6 charge added for this to be delivered.

Breakfast on the first morning was lovely however I asked for a small omelette containing mushrooms onion and cheese. The mushroom onion and cheese were raw and uncooked. The chef only cooked the egg part at least! The continental style part of the breakfast area was lovely however the carafes of water had run out.

On my second evening I dined in the restaurant and took a window seat with a wonderful view along the river and the service was excellent,  the staff came back and checked on me to see was everything okay and gave me my bill promptly. They could not be faulted!

The second morning at the hotel I once again decided to try and omelette as it is my preferred choice one and I hotel. I asked for the man to cook the inside contents of the omelette and then for them to be put inside the egg. I also then asked for the omelette be served well cooked. I loved my omelette on the second morning and I do hope that anybody who would like their omelette to be well cooked reads this review and takes it on board.

This morning, the coffee and water ran out and I was also sharing a table with a couple as the restaurant was extremely busy!

Upon checkout from the hotel I needed to have my bag stored as my flight was not departing until 8 PM local. I was given a ticket and the gentleman took my case from me, upon return my case was easily identified and returned to me promptly. 

The location of this hotel on the dock road and is excellent and the 747 bus direct to the airport stops about 3 yards from the hotel front door.

",5,2019,09,01
228,Wonderful Hotel,"This is an amazingly clean, bright hotel located only a 10 minute walk (along the river) to Temple Bar and 15 minutes to the Castle.

The room was clean and the view over the river was fantastic.  There is enough space to move around without tripping over each other!

The hotel has great facilities.  The gym is small but functional and for only €7 has its own washing machine and dryer.

It is around 3 minute walk from the nearest tram stop (great if you want to get to the zoo or jail).

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff.

It is one of the mire expensive hotels in Dublin.  But well worth every penny!",5,2019,08,31
228,Great hotel,"I stayed for one night with my mom. Beautifully presented spotless room, comfy bed, everything we needed and a river view. Out of the way so you aren't woken by the noisiness of the pubs, on the arriva bus route so can het that around Dublin or to the airport and a 10 minute walk to temple bar or trinity. Would definitely stay again.",5,2019,08,29
228,Garden in the heart of the city,"This a little gem of a hotel in the heart of the City on the banks of the Liffey river.
The rooms are recently renovated and tastefully done. The breakfast is excellent and the staff willing and attentive. If you want to stay in central Dublin this an excellent consideration.
",5,2019,08,25
228,I love this hotel,"I arrived back in Dublin today from a week in Mulranney. The hotel is very clean and modern. The restaurant downstairs was also good. I had twisted my knee the day before. The staff provided ice and bags to the room. I plan on returning to Dublin in the next few months and this Hilton will be home base. 
",5,2019,08,24
228,Fall getaway ,"Fantastic place to stay and very safe since I was traveling solo. Hotel was still under construction, but very clean and work was done during the day. All staff was very helpful with directing me to places to see and visit. Definitely will come back. ",5,2019,08,23
228,Clean and convenient,"This hotel is about half a kilometer from the Dublin Convention Centre where we were attending an event. The closest hotel is the Spencer, but the Hilton is a little cheaper and only a little further to walk. The airport bus stops right outside, as does the hop-on-hop-off tourist bus. The emigration museum,  EPIC, is right next door. The hotel is clean and well run. The staff are helpful and we had no issues whatsoever. The beds are a little firm for me, but I do like a bed you can sink into. I would say these would suit most people. We got a room with a river view, which was lovely. The room wasn't small, but why, oh why, do hotels have to put two double beds in a twin room, and only one chair. The beds took up so much room there was very little circulation space. The room would have been much better with two 3ft singles. The breakfast buffet could be a little fresher. We stayed six nights and more times than not the breakfast buffet had run out of something, eggs, bacon, sausage or on one occasion all three at once. It took a while to get the trays replenished. Also the black pudding and white pudding was dry enough to be crunchy. Not good. On our last day there were no pastries and even after asking, they did not appear. There was still plenty of food, of course, and a fresh omelette bar and a waffle maker if you wanted to go to the trouble. We ate dinner in the restaurant one night and it was excellent. Cost: E165 for 5 people which included a bottle of Pinotage Rose for E32. Altogether a pleasant hotel which I would happily visit again.",4,2019,08,20
228,Depend on Hilton,"When traveling to parts unknown I depend on Hilton for reliable accommodations. This one did not disappoint. The Hotel is in a quiet but convenient location. The Airlink bus from Dublin airport stops right in front of the hotel. The hotel is right next to the EPIC museum and the convention center. You can walk to restaurants and tourist sights easily. 

The room was small but clean, bathroom clean and modern. Lobby was nice, hotel staff friendly and helpful. They allowed us to check our bags when we arrived early in the morning. There is real coffee and snacks for sale in the lobby. 

Two tour groups stayed here, Globus and Rick Steves, while we were there and the huge buses parked out front.
",4,2019,08,19
228,"Convenient location with nice amenities, comfortable rooms.","We stayed here twice on a recent trip to Ireland - first, for two nights after arriving in Dublin, then for one night before leaving Ireland for the next leg of our trip. Both stays were very pleasant. The staff is friendly and helpful; the rooms were comfortable, clean and spacious. The location is convenient to transportation, restaurants and attractions - just a short walk to O'Connell Street and the Temple Bar area, but far enough away to avoid the noise and bustle of the center. The restaurant was so-so, but there are many other choices nearby. Best amenity for us was the guest-only laundry - a welcome bonus after a week on vacation with another week to go.",5,2019,08,18
228,Great hotel in great location,"We loved this hotel. We actually stayed here twice during our summer vacation, after the first time we changed our previous reservations at another hotel to the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House because of the location. It was possible to walk everywhere and we had amazing views from our room of the Liffy river. Our first stay on the 7th floor was great, the second stay we had a room on the 5th floor. Noise level from the street was a little worse on the 5th floor although not too bad but I would recommend a higher floor because of this. Staff we encountered all throughout the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was  nice but busy during our stay. The location was great for just walking to all the attractions in the city but also great because it's right in front of the bus stop for the Airlink Express that quickly takes you to the airport. Parking was in a parking garage right next to the hotel, there is a special exit door that leads closer to the garage than the front exit and the hotel validates parking for a cheaper rate. All in all, we had a great stay and enjoyed our time in Dublin.",5,2019,08,18
228,Worst wifi in the world?,"The hotel itself was nice and it’s in an excellent location. We were there on vacation and wanted to use the internet to plan what to do during our trip. It was almost impossible. Every few minutes you need to reconnect with their internet. It’s wrong for them to advertise free WiFi when the reality is that it barely functions. 

I’ve stayed in many hotels in Ireland and countless Hiltons across the globe (I’m a gold member). This hotel’s internet is the worst. ",2,2019,08,18
228,Wonderful breakfast,"We loved staying at this hotel. The beds were very comfortable. The location was good, with just a few minutes walk to O'Connell street. The breakfast buffet was amazing! I would definitely recommend this place :-)",5,2019,08,18
228,"Fabulous hotel, great location QUIET!",Staff so helpful and kind - food delicious and attached to Heathrow made everything so smooth!  Took train to central London with ease with option for fast or slower trains.  The beds were extremely comfortable and very roomy overall.  Only thing I would change is perhaps more lighting in the bathroom.  Food at breakfast was so so many choices and all very tasty.  We enjoyed a late dinner and even dessert and were not disappointed.  Business center was convenient in lobby.  ,5,2019,08,16
228,Wedding and honeymoon stay,"Rooms were well kept, cleaned immaculately, and had many features for comfort. The restaurant offers a breakfast buffet and many coffee options. At night, a full service dinner and bar. The bartender Stuart was kind, attentive, and really informative about local attractions, restaurants and pubs. There was also a trainee at the front desk who was a dutch gentleman. He was so kind and also helped us book the cliffs of moher tour the night before it took place which was helpful on such short notice. Thanks for a great time!",5,2019,08,16
228,Well located comfy Hilton hotel with great service in Dublin,"Our family of 4 fit very comfortably in the large, modern double queen room with plenty of storage. We enjoyed the onsite restaurant and bar and the staff was very helpful and friendly. This Hilton is located right on the River Liffey and was in walking distance to all of Dublin’s sights, except the Guinness Storehouse which was a quick cab ride. Cabs are always right outside for whenever you need them. Very enjoyable stay!",5,2019,08,16
228,Three nights at Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House,"It was a pleasant stay. We did not eat breakfast so I can't refer. The hotel has a very good location on the river. We arrived from Heuston train station by the tram red line ( the tram station is close to the hotel on a rear street) and in the last morning have left to Dublin airport by the Bus 747 ( very convenient,  the bus station is in the front of the hotel). Indeed the room was a bit small, but clean and quiet. We walked to the center.",5,2019,08,16
228,Good stay in Dublin ,"Nice hotel in a good location.  Rooms were a bit small especially with an infant.  The pack and play they provided was good but did not come with a mattress, just some folded up sheets.  The breakfast was good but extremely crowded.  The hotel is quite large and the dining area is small comparatively.  WiFi and fitness center were good and on-site laundry was a plus.  There is also a small store with snacks and toiletries.  ",4,2019,08,16
228,Three days of family fun in Dublin,"This hotel functions more like a full service Hilton. The front desk staffed seemed to be in training mode when we were there which made log in a little longer, but that is really our only complaint. The breakfast was plentiful and good. The rooms on the upper floors were pretty spacious for an urban hotel. We had never stayed in the Dockland area (we usually stay around St. Stephens Green) but this was fantastic!

The hotel management were on site and very hands on. Recommend for anyone!",5,2019,08,14
228,"Great River View , Bus to Airport!","We ha a great view of the river. Hotel is within walking distance to everything. We were able to walk to most places we wanted to visit. Staff were very cordial and helped with directions. Breakfast staff and hostess were very pleasant even with the very busy AM rush.Room was fine, King room. Plenty of room for the 2 of us. City express bus to airport is at front door 7 euro coins each. Minor billing error was resolved quickly and politely. Thanks!",5,2019,08,13
228,"Affordable, great location for walking to the sites","This is a solid hotel choice in Dublin. Clean, air-conditioned, comfortable. Oly’s Restaurant was surprisingly delicious. Richi, our waiter from Mauritius, was excellent. Stewart the bartender is a gem. Ask for a river view—wonderful.",5,2019,08,09
228,Great walkable hotel,"Really nice walkable hotel in Dublin! It’s right along the River Liffey, just across the bridge from the City Centre side of town. We walked everywhere! But there’s also a bus stop right outside (including the Hop On Hop Off and Airlink lines), and a Luas (light rail) stop the block behind the hotel. 

The room was clean and comfortable, and the hotel staff was friendly. We arrived early, before our room was ready, but it was no problem to leave luggage in their secure room.",5,2019,08,08
228,Perfect for my family,"I had been to Dublin with my wife five years ago and stayed in two of the posh hotels adjacent to Temple Bar District. Knowing the city's layout I realized the Hilton was very close walking distance to this. It also had rooms with two queen beds at reasonable rates. This was important because we had a large contigent this time...three sons, wife, girlfriends and grandchildren. The Hilton was very nicely appointed, comfortable beds, clean. Great hotel bar (Oly's) Next door is an excellent restaurant (Ely's) The front desk staff were professional and very helpful in every way imaginable. The breakfast was excellent and therein lies the rub. One morning we had a 6:00 a.m. tour to Belfast. We reqested boxed breakfasts waiting at the front desk and they were all ready. Naturally the variety was somewhat restricted and we expected that. It was a reasonable accommodation to our request. We toured Ireland and when we left for home on a Sunday morning we again missed out on the delicious breakfast. On Sundays it opens at 7:00 a.m. With so many people leaving on international flights I think it's reasonable to wish it was open earlier, even if it means a limited variety. Granola, muffins, coffee, toast. Don't expect the omelette maker to be in. Just a skeletal staff. I only say this because the breakfast is delicious. One shouldn't pay and lose out. Box breakfasts help but they could do more. All in all it's an excellent choice for Dublin. Really great service and very well situated.",4,2019,08,06
228,Great Location and Comfortable Room,"We had a good experience staying at this hotel located in central Dublin. Despite our arrival in the morning, our room was ready for check in. The room was spacious and comfortable. Beds very comfortable and bathroom modern and large. Our room overlooked the Liffey. Location is the main benefit of staying here. It was an easy 15-20 min walk to O'Connell Street or Trinity College along the River Liffey. Also very helpful is the Airport Express Bus that stops right outside the hotel. It was very quiet at night despite it's location in the city. The only negative is that breakfast which is not included seemed overpriced at 16 Euro but we were able to find a place down the street that was much less expensive.",5,2019,08,05
228,"Wonderful Staff, Awesome Location and Super Clean","BOOK IT IMMEDIATELY... YOU WON’T BE SORRY

I am currently on vacation with my 16 year old son and an adult friend of mine.  We took two rooms at the hotel.  The rooms are modern and beautiful.   Hotel is walking distance to all pubs, restaurants and Trinity College.  Staff was super kind and knowledge about activities.  My son needed to pick up a prescription from a pharmacy and the hotel staff was a huge help in getting me to the right place.   This has been a perfect stay so far.  Amazing breakfast included as a Diamond Member.  This hotel exceeded all expectations and I want to thank the entire staff.   You guys rock!!

Great job Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House!",5,2019,08,05
228,Great Time in Dublin,"We really enjoyed our stay (myself, wife and daughter).  The location is not in the historic district, but just outside with only an eight to ten minute walk away which in this case is nice due to the hotel's location (the airport flex-bus and 24 hour hop-on bus pickup right out front).  The area around the hotel is developed with a mix of restaurants, bars and attractions right next door (one is Epic,The Irish Emigration Museum which is brand new).  The hotel itself was very clean with an attentive staff and a great restaurant on the first floor.  If I would recommend anything, I would pay to have the breakfast included in the reservation and save a little.",5,2019,08,05
228,Wonderful hotel in center of everything,"We stayed here on a layover for one night and were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were great, clean and modern, great river view, walked to Trinity university and Temple Bar area easily. Really great places to explore I could have stayed longer, I had no idea Dublin had so much to offer. The hotel was so lovely and modern and the breakfast buffet was over the top awesome like you would get at an all inclusive resort. The staff were helpful and welcoming and I would highly Recommend this hotel to anyone. Especially families. It’s about a ten minute drive from airport approx €28 very easy, I’m so glad we chose this hotel instead of the airport ones. You can’t go wrong with Hilton they are awesome. ",5,2019,08,04
228,Disappointing ... to say the least! ,"Upon arrival the reception staff (who could hardly speak or understand English) adviser myself and my friend that we had booked and paid for 2 rooms with a door connecting the 2. We hadn’t, and had just booked and paid for a twin or a double room. I was concerned that we had paid more than necessary but the staff could not understand anything I was trying to say. After getting up at 3am and feeling exhausted, we decided to forget trying to sort this out and asked to be moved to a double room or a twin room with a bath (as previously paid for). The room we got was right at the back of the hotel, with no bath. I politely rang the reception to explain and they just did not understand me and kept transferring me through to a number which didn’t ring out. I kept calling back but they never answer. After visiting reception we got moved to another room. Rooms were clean and comfortable. We ordered room service a couple of times and a random man in what looked like a plumbers uniform brought our water to the room and wanted us to pay at the door - kind of defeats the idea of room service. I can honestly say the customer service was appalling and it ruined our hotel stay. Not one person smiled, reception constantly seemed in a mood and were so unhelpful. I honestly wouldn’t stay again, ever. The hotel makes me look at the brand Hilton very differently. It felt out of date and extremely poor customer service. ",1,2019,08,02
228,Nice Accommodation with Good Location,"This hotel is very clean appearing to have been recently updated. Rooms are on the small side but beds were comfortable and everything was clean. We had 2 connecting rooms, which were not ready when we arrived after an overnight flight and asked about early check in. Sarah at the front desk was very helpful in making sure that our room needs were met, following up and keeping us informed. Our 2 night stay included breakfast which was a lovely hot & cold buffet and an omelet station. My only complaint was that some of the hot food pans were allowed to sit empty and on our 2nd morning only 1 out of 3 coffee machines was working. But overall the breakfast was good & more than adequate. This hotel is located right next to the Emigration Museum across from the river and we were able to walk to several attractions. There is an added security measure that in order to summons a lift, you must use your room key. There are bus stops right in front of the hotel which is very convenient. When I return to Dublin, I will stay here and not feel any need to look for different accommodations. ",4,2019,08,01
228,Excellent staff and service,"Worth all the five stars   , very friendly staff . We left another hotel mid stay and changed to here . Chalk and cheese . The Hilton was another level. Comfortable rooms with aircon.  ( it was very warm this time of year ).",5,2019,07,31
228,I love this place,"When I have a time to be with friends, I go trips and usually I stay at this place because They treat us well, day and night. Their restaurant is also clean and foods are great. I love this place and would like to recommend you guys on TripAdvisor.",5,2019,07,30
228,"Lovely hotel, good location, had all the needed amenities","I stayed here for 2 nights in June (13-15) with family in 1 room & my friend & I shared another room. We had to wait a bit to get into the room but not bad. This is a great, normal Hilton, good location, comfortable rooms, quiet & good amenities. I needed to use their laundry as I was traveling for a month, was able to do this near midnight & no one bothered me, they are a 24 hr hotel, even met a fellow Hawaiian in the laundry room ! Did not use the restaurant, but they also have a handy area to pick up a juice or something quick in the AM or anytime. Staff were friendly & helpful with directions, etc. I loved being right across from the Liffey river, was a good location to get to other places of interest, yet was a bit off the beaten track so was quiet & pleasant. I would definitely return here & totally recommend it !!",4,2019,07,30
228,Great location!,"We stayed at Hilton Garden Inn for 4 nights. Our room was comfortable, clean, and had a really good bed.It had the usual amenities including a small fridge which was handy. Also a big plus that there was AC.
It has a great location right beside Liffey and close to the Samuel Beckett Bridge (Harp bridge). The Airport express bus and the Hop-on-hop-off bus stop is basically right outside the hotel. It is also really easy to get a taxi. The EPIC museum is next door and  It is about a 15 minute walk to  the Temple Bar area and about 20 to Grafton Street.
We had a quiet drink or coffee at the bar area in the late afternoon, which was really nice after the busy streets of Dublin. We never ate in the restaurant but it did seem popular.  
My only gripe was that sometimes we could hear other guests in the room next door. 
IAnd I also think it is strange that they don't offer complementary water for a hotel of this kind. Otherwise Hilton Garden suited our needs in Dublin.",4,2019,07,29
228,Relaxing haven after a night of travel,"I arrived at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House after an overnight/transatlantic flight. They were friendly and welcoming at check in. Even though it was before noon, my room was ready and they graciously allowed me to go up. I freshened up and then went on a walk to adjust to the time. After returning I had lunch in their restaurant, which was quite delicious, and visited the Epic Museum (right next door). The view from my room was incredible, and the bed was quite comfortable. I hope to return again. ",5,2019,07,29
228,Mostly great,"Our stay got off to a rocky start when we arrived in Dublin early in the morning and were hoping to get into one of our rooms for a quick rest. Our room wasn’t ready until 3:00, can’t fault them for that , but our second room wasn’t ready until 6 pm. There were 5 of us trying to rest, then shower in 1 small room. 
Once we got the 2 Nd room all was good. Great location, good breakfast and friendly staff. ",4,2019,07,28
228,Great choice on the Liffey,"This is the first time I have stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House.  It is a great property that is well run, clean, and staffed with excellent employees.  If you have status with Hilton it is a good choice to pick the breakfast rather than extra points -- an amazing breakfast with both European and American choices.  A short 15-20 minute walk to the City Center of Dublin.  Great views of the Liffey!",5,2019,07,28
228,Ireland visit,"The hotel is centrally located. We were 0.3 miles from the Irish Emigration Museum. If you don’t mind walking, we were able to walk to Dublin Castle, Temple Bar, and Trinity College. There were several good restaurants near by. The staff was very helpful. We had breakfast included every day. The day we had an early tour, they packed us a boxed breakfast that included a yogurt drink, an apple, a muffin, a granola bar, water, and some crackers. We are our boxed breakfast on the tour bus. We did have to park in a garage close by, but they validated our ticket( for a small discount).",4,2019,07,27
228,Wonderful stay in centrally located hotel,We stayed here for 5 nights and enjoyed every moment. The hotel is kept in an excellent condition and we found the staff to be very friendly. The room was spacious and well equipped for a longer stay. The bar fridge was a definite plus. Breakfast was delicious with a large variety and they even had a very good selection of gluten free goodies. But the best about this hotel is definitely its location. An easy walk to a lot of Dublin attractions and with a hop-on hop-off bus stop right in front of the hotel. You can't go wrong with this hotel when visiting Dublin.,4,2019,07,27
228,Clean and central,"I stayed in the Hilton for one night and was very happy with my stay. The location was great, very central. The room was very clean and comfortable. It's a bit noisy, but it was just what I was looking for. Would definitely return if I had to stay in Dublin for a night.",4,2019,07,26
228,Lovely hotel,"Well placed for transport (airport bus, ferry terminal and Connelly station) and very peaceful. On the waterfront it's an easy walk to Temple Bar, Trinity, Dublin Castle and brilliantly located for visiting the Jeanie Johnston ship and the Epic Museum. Comfy room, very quiet, excellent service and a hearty breakfast. Would stay here again.",5,2019,07,25
228,a gem of a place to stay in Dublin,This hotel was a wonderful choice for my first stay in Dublin. My husband stayed in Dublin several years ago but did not stay here and he agreed that the Hilton Garden Inn was in a much better spot as far as being able to walk to many things plus the fact that there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel made getting to the airport a breeze.,5,2019,07,25
228,Pleasant surprise,"We booked this hotel for the first two nights of our Ireland vacation. We booked a family suite and were overly pleased upon check in to find that we had a wonderful corner room with extensive windows overlooking downtown Dublin and the river.  Our room had a mini refrigerator, 2 TVs and a separate living and work area. There was entry of room for us to spread out and have separate spaces. The bathroom was oversized, very clean and nice large bath towels. It is conveniently located and walking distance to restaurants and pubs. We would definitely stay in this hotel again. ",5,2019,07,25
228,Perfect for our family,"We chose this hotel because it was one of the few that we could find in the city with two Queen-sized rooms and it had air-conditioning. While the room was not large per U.S. Standards, it worked well for our family. The shower was larger than some we've had in Europe. Our room on the 5th floor had a wonderful view of the river, and we appreciated that it was in a quieter area of the town. There is a HOHO stop right outside the hotel that was very convenient. Also right next door is a small museum and retail area that included several small cafes open for breakfast and lunch.The hotel is located in the financial district so there isn't much activity there at night, but we were able to walk to the Temple Bar area in about 15 minutes.",4,2019,07,24
228,Amazing Hotel with Fantastic Staff,"We stayed at this hotel for 8 days and could not have been happier!  The hotel is in a great location because it's out of the party area, but still close to everything.  Our accommodations were clean and well maintained, and the staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable.  I could not have asked for a better experience!",5,2019,07,24
228,Great Hotel for families in Dublin.,Close to the city but not in the party area eg. Temple Bar. 15 minutes walk to Trinity College.  Good breakfast and good clean rooms.  Easy access to the airport with the bus stop right outside the entrance. ,4,2019,07,24
228,Terrific hotel,"The Hilton Garden Inn is in a very good location in Dublin.  It may be a few blocks further away from the Temple Bar area than we would have wanted, but it was worth the walk.  It is right on the river with great views of the bridges.  The staff is superb and very helpful and friendly.   ",5,2019,07,23
228,"Great hotel, perfect location","Can't say enough about this hotel.  To me its the best place to stay in Dublin.  Right on the river overlooking the center of town but just far enough away.  The hotel seemed to be newer.  It's in a newer area, but still close to great pubs, restaurants, walking distance to Trinity College and Temple Bar, etc.  

Rooms are spacious and modern.  They have a breakfast buffet every morning that's free if your Diamond status.  They also have a decent bar to end the night if you want.  Just a block up is the tram if you don't want to walk and the hop on/ hop off buses stop right in front.  I don't recommend the Big Red.  Seemed like there were more of the green DoDublin buses.  Front desk folks were knowledgeable about tour companies and how to get around.

This would be where I'd want to stay every time I came to Dublin.",5,2019,07,22
228,Great stay,We really enjoyed our two day stay here. Due to the location of the hotel we were able to walk everywhere instead of having to rely on transportation. We used a taxi from the hotel which came out to between 25-35 Euros and took about 20 min but the Airlink Express bus drops/picks you up right in front of the hotel. During our stay itself we walked everywhere and were able to see quite a lot of Dublin by foot. We were even able to pack another sightseeing trip into our travel day due to the location of the hotel right next door to the Epic emigration museum (which my kids really liked). After check out we dropped our luggage with the hotel and I really appreciated how well they secured our luggage. They store it in a locked room and the employee checked each piece of luggage against the tickets we received during drop off. I felt like my suitcases were really secure. So often hotels just leave your luggage in a hallway or unsecured room so this felt really safe. We had a deluxe twin room and ended up in a corner room with amazing views of the river on both sides. Room service was super fast and the check in was quick and efficient and I felt appreciated as a diamond member. We ended up in the restaurant right after breakfast and before lunch started and the employees were super helpful and accommodating and made sure our food came out quickly. All in all we had a great stay and actually booked our next trip to Dublin in August in the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House again.,5,2019,07,19
228,Perfect base for a Dublin visit,"We stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn (HGI) twice in June: once for 3 nights at the front end of our European vacation, and then for 1 night again before our flight back to the States. It was very convenient, very comfortable, and the staff were pleasant and efficient from start to end. We took the Airlink 757 bus from the airport. It stops directly across the street from the hotel entrance. You can take the 747 bus, but you'd have to get off one stop earlier and walk 7 minutes or so to the hotel, because the 747 turns off right before the HGI and continues along a different route. If you're traveling light, this is a good option because the 747 leaves the airport every 10 to 12 minutes or so, but the 757 runs about every 25 minutes. On our two trips from the airport, it seemed there were 3 or 4 747s for every 757, but we were traveling ""heavy"" so accepted the extra wait. We arrived around 11am on our first visit. Our room wasn't ready, so they checked our bags in a secure baggage room and we headed out. Since neither of us sleeps well on an overnight flight, we were pretty tired. We opted to take the hop-on-hop-off bus (the green one, DoDublin), which stopped right in front of the hotel (another benefit of staying there). We did the full circuit (close to 2 hours) and got right back off in front of the hotel. Our room was ready when we got back. It was spacious for a center-city hotel, and nicely updated. Breakfasts (included in our Diamond membership, optional extra for others) were very plentiful and would have been worth the price had we paid: made-to-order omelettes and French toast; waffles, scrambled eggs and tasty breakfast meats, yogurts, fruits, fresh breads and scones, full English breakfast options. When booking tours out into the countryside (cliffs of Moher, etc.), consider Darby O'Gills Tours because they, too, pick up right in front of the hotel. The other big ones pick up a 10-15 minutes early-morning walk away (not a bad thing, just a consideration in a rain-prone city). Both times back to the airport, we opted to have the front desk call a taxi for us. There's no extra pickup fee for this; you pay whatever is on the meter. It was about 27 euro and worth every penny! The Dublin taxi drivers had great stories to tell--great Irish tales to weave! Those rides were actually among the highlights of our trip!",5,2019,07,17
228,Family vacation,"The hotel was clean and our room was great. Very spacious family suite. The only issue was that breakfast starts at 0730 when most yours leave before that, very inconvenient especially if you had paid for breakfast ",5,2019,07,16
228,A great lunch...,"Having spent the better part of the morning touring the Famine Ship, we needed a good sit down place for lunch.  Without knowing of the restaurant. We walked into the hotel to collect our thoughts.

We saw the very convenient restaurant,  and said, ""why not?"" 

It was a great relaxing dining experience with wonderful service and a nice view of the river.

The menu was excellent, and we would certainly do it again if we ever find ourselves in Dublin.

We might even stay at the hotel if its service is as good as the restaurant  ",4,2019,07,14
228,4 nights at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House - diamond member perspective,"We just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin and had an amazing time.  As a Hilton Diamond member, I considered the other Hilton and Conrad properties in Dublin - but this appeared to be the best option because of it's location and amenities.

  It was the best choice we could have made. There were three of us, and we got an upgraded room with two queen beds on the 7th floor which was nice or nicer than Hilton Garden Inn rooms in the US.  Standard for HGI, there was also a refrigerator, large size tv, nice bathroom.  We also had a really nice view, but in all honesty - we didn't spend much time appreciating it as we were out and about - but it was beautiful waking up to and seeing the lights in the evening. 
Every morning there is a really impressive breakfast  with plenty of seating and  that was surprisingly vegetarian friendly, which was wonderful.  

The hotel also has a washer and dryer (2 each) best advice is do it early morning or late at night to have no wait. The hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating and as mentioned, the hotel is in a great location and we pretty much walked everywhere and it's a treat to be able to walk along the riverside.  Temple Bar, Trinity College- all easy to get to all within walking distance and there are some really nice neighborhood pubs (with live music) also just a short walk from the hotel and grocery stores.  

We also took a few day trips (with Paddywagon Tours) and the pick up spot is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel.   Getting to and from the airport - we just opted to take Uber, which worked out fine.",4,2019,07,14
228,Great Dublin Hotel,Lovely hotel with a great location -- about 15 minutes to Temple Bar area.  The room was a good size and clean.  Really appreciated the air conditioning with the heat and humidity!  It was nice having a restaurant/bar downstairs. On-site laundry would have been great to use if we had had more time -- but wanted to spend our limited time seeing as much of Dublin as we could for the 1 day/2 nights that we were there.  We would definitely recommend and stay again in the future.,5,2019,07,13
228,Typical Hilton Garden Inn,"The Good: location is good, not in the middle of everything but not that far out of the action either. The room on 6th floor had a good view of the city.
The Bad: nothing stands out as ‘bad’ just that everything could be a bit better 
The Ugly: no ugly bits.
As with most garden inns, this one is also a budget Hilton. You get the basics. Not. Big problem if you just need a place to stay. The staff is courteous but not comparable to actual Hilton’s. the rooms are not bad, the on that I was in had a nice view. Breakfast is the standard eggs and sausages, this being Ireland, you also get black and white pudding. 
Over all, not bad.",3,2019,07,13
228,Lies,"After having to change our plans we contacted the hotel and expected some compassion and common sense from the manager Jade, from this point on we where faced with lies. I understand policy is policy but finger pointing and passing the buck. Why not just be honest and upfront. Would have saved us hours of confusion and and trying to decipher the truth. Would not recommend on the basis of this. ",1,2019,07,12
228,Average,"Pricey for what it is. Supposedly had king deluxe room which was a king size bed in a small room, making it even smaller. Room was clean and quiet.  No bottles of water in room for guest, no breakfast included in rate. Surrounding area quiet during mid week, no pubs or food available after 11.00pm. Only bright spot was friendly local barman in hotel bar after 11.00pm. Functional, but not sure I would return.",3,2019,07,11
228,Perfect for pre and post cruise stays,Perfectly located.  Grafton Street area easily walkable from here.  The hotel restaurant has a better than average restaurant.  Short can ride to the cruise Pier.  Highly recommend if you are cruising. Rooms are a bit small but clean and quiet.,5,2019,07,11
228,Surprisingly great stay,"I’m in Dublin once or twice a year for business, and typically stay on the south side as there’s both more to do, and quieter areas.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to find this location and property more than suitable to the point I’ll add it to my rotation.  Located right on the north bank of the river, substantially far towards the harbor, I was worried going in.  However, sometimes I forget how small and walkable Dublin truly is.  Located steps from the nearest bridge, you can be in St. Stephen’s Green within 20 minutes on foot, and being a bit to the East eased some of the tourist traffic, making this the perfect jumping off point for exploring if you prefer a quitter although maybe longer walk to the tourist spots.  It also made for a great morning run along the river out towards the docks.

The hotel itself was clean and comfortable, with many lobby seats, though they were normally taken and in a high traffic area.  The lobby has a bar and restaurant (typical but tasty breakfast spread included with my rate) as well as a snack stand to buy provisions like water and crisps. The elevator was even fast, if incongruous with the rest of the hotel, European-small.  I had a water view room, which I’d highly recommend as it made for some incredible views south over Dublin and into the hills, not to mention the river itself. The room was very large, and while I find Dublin hotels tend to provide larger rooms than other European cities, it still surprised me.  The room had amble seating and work space, bed-side plugs, a large, but confusing to control TV, with plentiful channels (one of my favorite Dublin experiences is falling asleep to random sports channels we just don’t see in the states,) and a mini-fridge.  Based on the room alone, I’d consider staying here again.   

Staff were mostly pleasant, but the property was clearly seeing a shift in staff, as almost all front desk interactions included someone being trained.  The only sub-optimal experience was at the bar itself.  Now in most places, I probably wouldn’t even have noticed, but I find Dublin to be one of those spots that matches stereotypes, in that almost everyone is ridiculously nice, outgoing, and cheerful (or acting that way) to see and interact with you.  However, the bar staff were a bit curt.  Again, not in any substantial way, but it was noticeable in a city of incredible bartenders.  The bar also was missing some Dublin standbys, incredibly not offering Teeling’s.

I obviously really had to search for any cons to this property.  It’s certainly not perfectly situated, but I enjoyed its location, and the room and view can’t be beat.  It was also miles cheaper than some of the south bank locations I normally default to, and that price certainly did not come with the detractions I had expected.",4,2019,07,10
228,"Great location, clean rooms, and solid breakfast buffet","I stayed here with my wife, teen daughter, and almost-teen son for three nights.  The location is a good one for at least two reasons:  (1) the Airlink bus from the airport is cheap and drops you right in front of the hotel; and (2) it's well situated in the downtown area.  

We had the two queen room, which worked well for us.  Beds and pillows were comfortable.  Importantly, there was air conditioning!

Our breakfast was included.  The buffet is actually pretty good.  Large selection of food, included standard hot food (sausage, hash browns, grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, etc...), a made-to-order omelet bar, make-your-own Belgian waffles, freshly made pastries, ample cut fruit choices, Irish porridge, and yogurt. 

I wish there were more towel racks.  It was hard to hang four bath towels.  Also, it would be nice if there were ice machines on the room floors (there's only a single dispenser in the lobby).

The staff was friendly and helpful.",5,2019,07,10
228,girls weekend,"lovely staff, basic rooms but great location for concerts at the 3 arena. Didn't eat there so can't comment on food. Had a triple room. Single bed larger than average, double smaller than average. Place was spotless.",5,2019,07,09
228,Great stay,"Stayed here for a friends hen do. All parts of hotel very clean, rooms large and spacious, beds really comfy. We had a view of the river which was lovely. Good choice for the breakfast buffet. Only criticism is experienced bar staff needed as very slow service.",5,2019,07,06
228,Great Hotel in Good Location,"We really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The room was very nice and spacious, the breakfast was good and hearty, and the location cannot be beaten. Our room was quiet and we had a great view. We appreciated the laundry facilities since we were leaving Ireland to spend another week traveling. The staff were very helpful and nice.",5,2019,07,05
228,Perfect location on the river.,"I enjoyed staying at this Marriott Hotel and it was the same as the United States Garden Inns. Food and rooms were perfect and the staff was courteous, eventhough the city had a big Spice Girls Concert and a big Soccer Game at the same time. The city was absolutely crowded with people, needless to say the streets, and hotels were packed.
But yet the employees had smiles on their faces. Very nice stay. Good job!",4,2019,07,04
228,Great base for a family vacation in Dublin,"We recently did a roadtrip through Ireland and started at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House. Reception was very friendly and allowed us to check in to our rooms quite early. The beds were extremely comfortable and we had a great view of the river. It's a relatively short walk to a many of the major attractions (St. Stephens Green, Trinity College, Temple Bar, etc) with very convenient dining and shopping. 

The breakfast buffet had some of the best regular coffee on the trip and whole whole facility seemed quiet and clean. We only used room service once, but the food was decent. Parking is not free, but it is discounted and the lot was very accessible. We'd definitely stay again.",5,2019,07,03
228,Great Stay in Dublin,"As HGVC and HH members, Hilton properties are our first choice when traveling. The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House is one of the best HGI's I've ever experienced.  From the pleasant and helpful staff to the comfortably firm beds, we had a nice pre-cruise stay.  

The breakfast buffet had a great selection, including cooked to order omelets. As HH members, our breakfast was provided with our room rate.

The Airport Airlink Bus dropped us directly in front of the hotel.  The hop on-hop off sightseeing bus also stops in front of the hotel.  However, most everything is within walking distance, i.e., O'Connell Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College.  

Pleasant staff, clean and comfortable rooms, great breakfast, ease of transportation. HGI Dublin Custom House is a wonderful place to stay when visiting Dublin.",5,2019,07,02
228,5th visit and it’s still a pleasure to visit ,"Another great stay at the hotel, staff and facilities are excellent recommend the breakfasts they set you up for the day abd it’s is a lovely walk along the Liffey into the city centre. We will be back next year.",5,2019,07,01
228,On the Liffey,"Located on the east-ish side of the main Dublin action, on the north side of the Liffey.  It was a great location overall.  Great breakfast buffet.  Small exercise facility.  Also has a somewhat pricey coin laundry.   Would likely consider staying here again.",4,2019,06,30
228,Nice,"Overall was very nice, food was lovely , staff were very nice bar getting asked for ID on multiple occasions even tho i’m 24 and my boyfriend is older but looks younger and never got asked once for ID but i understand that’s their job but oh well i took it as a compliment 😂 The drink was a bit pricey but i guess that’s the way it is in Dublin. Breakfast in the morning was so so, it was okay and done the job but could be better and reach higher standards. Overall it was good.",5,2019,06,26
228,Hilton Garden is in great location,"Love the location on the river and a few blocks from the center, bus lines run in front of the building as does the hop on hop off. Airport shuttle stop is in front of the building, and you can do a 3 day combo pass with the hope-on-hope-off bus and the city buses, a great deal. The hotel has a great breakfast buffet, and a good lounge and bar. Lunch & dinner is available but there are so many very good places to eat in the city we did not eat at the hotel, but the people who did said it was very good. There are great restaurants in back of the immigration museum next door and we ate in one with a basement area of very old stones that was romantic. The staff on the desk was excellent at checking in and helping you find attractions around the city. The room are big by Europe standards and the A/C works great. I would stay here any time we go back to Dublin. The rooms are very clean and maid service was top notch and helped with any thing we asked for.",5,2019,06,26
228,Good but not great,Great location on Airlink route.  Walkable distance to Temple Bar area and other attractions.  Rooms are average.  Good electrical outlets for business travelers.  Some bathrooms have tub/shower combos.  Breakfast buffet is the same everyday and lacks good variety for health-conscious eaters.  Nice staff!,3,2019,06,26
228,There are better choices,"Could be better.  The hotel lacks life in it.  Staff members do their job, but that's it.  The guests must feel they are appreciated, which was missing. The hotel takes it for granted that the brand name will carry them forward.  There is more to it than that",3,2019,06,25
228,Great location,"A very nice hotel situated on the River Liffey, 10 minute walk from Temple Bar. Central for restaurants and bars. Hotel bar expensive but plenty of other places nearby. 50% discount on parking. Very clean and twin room overlooking the river was very spacious. I would definitely recommend.",5,2019,06,25
228,perfect stay,"I love Hilton Garden Inn and Dublin Custom House did not disappoint.  Clean, quiet, great service, and I slept like the dead, all of which I needed badly!  Exceptional breakfast!  The hotel also serves dinner and has a full service bar.  ",5,2019,06,25
228,Surprisingly impressed,"Used Hilton points for a stay so unsure of the price but the hotel had clearly been recently refurbished. Room was very large and clean. Excellent buffet breakfast with outstanding coffee 😁. Staff were friendly and helpful. Good location but still a bit of a hike into the centre. Nice gym as well. Hotel also offered a guest laundry which was a nice facility.

On site parking though useful was expensive especially if you went in and out a few times. Costing 4 euro an hour or 18 euro overnight when validated by hotel.
Very comfortable and highly recommended ",4,2019,06,24
228,Waitress Ciara best and friendliness,We asked for the same server all 3 nights because she was so friendly and helpful.   I would recommend everyone ask for her.  Not only did she help with food choices but she also helped us figure out how to get to places how to pronounce things and generally helped us with anything we needed.  Thank you Ciara.,5,2019,06,23
228,Great Stay,"This is a wonderful hotel in a great location, the rooms were spotless, comfortable and quite. The breakfast staff are excellent as well as the food they prepare. They are some good restaurants in the area as well as a great museum. The only problem we encountered was that we were charged twice for our room and one charge is still pending, we would like to get this resolved.",5,2019,06,22
228,Very Quiet with a super breakfast,"Very quiet, excellent breakfast. They offer made to order eggs and a huge selection. The 747/757 bus stops at the door. We had a very quiet room with an interior view. Lots of USB outlets. We didn't figure out how to work the water pressure in the shower until we were done.",5,2019,06,22
228,Great stay with the family,My family of eight (4 adults and 4 kids) felt this was a good place to stay.  It’s in a great location within walking distance of several popular sights.  The hotel was clean and had very friendly staff.  The breakfast was excellent with lots of options!  Highly recommended hotel,5,2019,06,22
228,A great Dublin Stay,"A great location in Dublin, walking distance to all the sights, a nice modern, clean hotel. The staff were friendly, the breakfast is top notch. Would definitely stay again. We initially booked as we are Hilton Honors members but even if we were not this is a great stay.",5,2019,06,18
228,Great Business Class Hotel,Decent standard Hilton Garden in business area but a moderate walk into town or a cab ride. Rooms were classic business hotel style. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We had the very extensive breakfast buffet included in the room and the buffet had an outstanding selection including omelet and breakfast meats and cheeses.,5,2019,06,16
228,Fantastic stay,"We stayed here last weekend and was really impressed with the hotel. The check in was nice and quick and we received a warm welcome. The bedrooms were beautiful and cosy and we were lucky to have a view of the river. The lobby areas and corridors were all clean well looked after. We didnt spend much time in the hotel but we have to say our highlight was the breakfast. I never normally bother with it but im so glad I did. We were so impressed to see such a wide range of choices, it was the best breakfast we'd had. We will be back. Thank you ",5,2019,06,16
228,"very bad service, extremly rude and unproffessional staff members","We had a few clients staying in the hotel recently. The clients asked if they can upgrade their rooms. Reservationsteam members were all extremly rude and unproffessional when we asked to change room types as we did not book the rooms directly with the hotel. When the staff member asked us can we help with something else we said to her ""you did not help us at all"". Her answer was a loud laugh. She is definitely not taking her job serious. Clients got overcharged in the end for upgraded rooms. We will never book this hotel again. Stay away if you can. ",1,2019,06,15
228,Absolutely Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed here as we were seeing Elton John in concert in the 3Arena. Position is excellent being within 15 min walk of the arena. Hotel is very clean and finished to a high standard. Staff were helpful and friendly. Bed was wonderful for a great nights sleep. We didn't eat in as we wanted to experience Dublin bars and restaurants, Would definitely recommend this hotel. We also took a 757 bus from airport which stops directly outside. Walk to centre of Dublin was about 30 min. But we were quite happy with that as you see more when you walk. Would stay here again if I was going to a concert at 3arena or just visiting Dublin",5,2019,06,15
228,"Perfect, great service and very comfortable","Stayed here for a couple of nights with my daughter as one of the nights was to see Elton John in concert at the 3Arena. Perfect location to walk to the arena and into town. Also the airlink bus from the airport stopped right outside the hotel and was very convenient. We were able to select our room using my Hilton honours account before we arrived and still st Heathrow airport which we thought was great. Our room was very very comfortable and clean. We chose 314 as we wanted to see the river Liffey and town from our room, not the back of the building. There was no issue with traffic noise at all which you may have thought would be a problem. It had dual  aspect windows which was a bonus. We did not order breakfast as we wanted the flexibility of a rest and no rush to get up early. However after the concert we went to oly’s bar and had a few drinks and a pizza which was fab. Could not fault this hotel in service at all. To top things off, my daughter forgot to check under the bed before leaving and had left a loved cuddly toy and a drinking bottle. After a couple of calls to the hotel Amy managed to locate them and they are now on their way home to us. Would not hesitate to stay here again For any trip to Dublin. Thanks again Hilton garden inn team.",5,2019,06,14
228,Shame to the Name,"This is the second time, whilst arriving late at night, Hilton have wilfully lied to me telling me that emergency maintenance had to be carried out on my room and thus nothing was available for the night - we will try another hotel for you. Lies. THey have a system of overbooking and the later in the evening you arrive the higher the chance that they will sell your room to someone else - thus getting double revenue for the one night.  This is deceitful and shameful. Long story short - I demanded my whole stay (3 nights) be given free - I got my demands - they didn't want a monumental dress down in front of existing staff and admired to the practise of overbooking. Liars and cheats.",1,2019,06,14
228,"Great location, convenient.","This was a very nice room. Lots of room. Big bathroom. Compared to other places we stayed this had all the amenities. Was pleased that they had laundry facilities, Could catch the Hop On Hop Off bus right outside the door. Very convenient and helpful staff.",4,2019,06,13
228,Lovely Hotel,"Really nice hotel, comfortable beds and a nice shower. Restaurant food is average and the drinks are very expensive. Big selection of food for breakfast. Staff were friendly and it was a very clean room. ",4,2019,06,10
228,Mid week stay,"I feel this hotel is way overpriced , we paid €280 per night , I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels worldwide and feel that in comparison even to other Dublin hotels it could do better . I’d stay in the “the Gibson “ hotel over this one if I was going to the 3 arena again . 
Don’t get me wrong food good , bed comfy , rooms clean modern but small ( made he even smaller by the 2 queen beds ) 
",3,2019,06,10
228,Excellent Stay!,"Everything from check-in to check-out was wonderful. The entire hotel is very clean and well-kept. The beds and bedding are very comfortable, the bathroom was well stocked with enough toiletries and towels daily. The front desk, bar and restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was good if you are there for sight-seeing, there is a bus-stop right out front for both the city and hop-on-hop-off tour bus. Temple Bar area is a short 10-15 minute walk away (depending on how quickly you walk). If you prefer a cab, not difficult to get as they run by fairly often, or the front desk will arrange one for you. I would highly recommend this hotel for business, couples, families - anyone staying in Dublin, it's an excellent choice.",5,2019,06,10
228,Perfect,"Loved this hotel.  Great location.  Airport and HOHO buses stop right outside the hotel.
Lovely modern room with comfortable beds, quiet location.  Great staff.  Really good breakfast with lots of variety.  Had a lovely view of the river from the room.  Kettle with tea, coffee and cookies provided in room.",5,2019,06,09
228,Fantastic Stay,"Was not sure what to expect when we booked this as have had previous poor experiences with other Hiltons, however was really delighted with our stay. The room was large, over looking the Liffey, clean and nicely decorated. The bed was so comfortable with nice linens and a good comfortable set of pillows. Check in and check out were quick and easy too. Lovely bar, open until 1:30am, with friendly staff. There is also an after hours shop where you can buy convenience foods like sandwiches and water if you need too. Not overly expensive either. Great location. The airline bus picks you up just outside and drops you off a little distance away. The red Luas line is a four minute walk away which brings you into the heart of the city in no time. Don't overlook this delight!",5,2019,06,09
228,Nice place conveniently located!,"First off let me say we enjoy walking.  From the Hilton we easily walked to Trinity College/The Book of Kells, Christ Church, the GPO, the bus station, Trinity Bar, and numerous other places.  Our stay at the Hilton was very pleasant.  Comfortable room with nice furnishings.  The free wifi worked fine.",4,2019,06,08
228,Excellent location very central,"Stayed here 4 2 nights.great location very central and hop on hop off buses stop at door. Great way to get around. We walked a lot but still really handy. Rooms clean and functional had 2 beds and large screen smart tv. Good sized bathroom.
We had dinner 1 night food good  reasonable choices was convenient.
We also had breakfast on our last day just continental option. Excellent choices but pricey for what it was. Suited us as saved a walk on our last morning. Lots of eating places close by gives options for a longer stay.
Would definatley stay here again",4,2019,06,07
228,Lovely!,"We flew into Dublin very very early in the morning. The front desk people were very pleasant and accommodating, storing our luggage while we walked around the city, and managing an 11:30 check in for us. The breakfast was delicious, room clean and comfortable. The hotel is an easy walk to shops and restaurants. I’d definitely stay again!",5,2019,06,07
228,On the button,"Couldn’t really fault it apart from the housekeeping insistence on opening my windows despite the hoolie blowing outside. Good rooms, good facilities and better than average breakfast. 3 mins from tram stop and ~25 euro taxi from airport. Not v central but easy to get in and there is quite a lot nearby too. Left content.",4,2019,06,06
228,great stay,I am a Hilton Diamond member and the HGI is Dublin could be my favorite Hilton there.  this was my 1st stay at this property and would definately book again.  I worked with Branislav  ( sp ) at the front desk for several weeks in advance to fine tune my series of reservations and when I got there everything was smooth and my friend and I went checked in rigtht away.  all the agents at the FD were excellent and I regret I didn't take note of all their names.  we were given a huge corner room.  Housekeeping was excellent  and everything was extremely clean.  the ONLY thing I can find ANY fault with was that our curtains were pushed wide open each day making the room very warm at the end of the day and it would then take quite a while to cool the room down . the dining room staff was also excellent and we were very impressed by the very efficient and pleasant  hostess of Mexican origin as well as the manager there that we had contact with.,5,2019,06,04
228,Very convenient hotel with lots of added extras.,"This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a convenient location, which is quiet.  We went to the 3Arena for a show, but also walked into town.  I especially liked the added extras of the fridge and safe in the room and lots of sockets to plug in all our phones.  The duvet was down and the beds were very comfortable.  There was air conditioning which we needed as it was very hot in the room. In the morning the breakfast was brilliant and my daughter loved the waffle station.  Lots of room to sit as they use the whole of the downstairs area.  My only criticism is the high price charged for drinks at the bar.  Great parking at the car-park directly behind the hotel at a reduced price.  Get them to stamp your ticket at reception.",5,2019,06,04
228,"Nice, clean hotel and great location ","Within 3 minutes walking distance to the 3 arena and 15 minutes to O Connell street this hotel is in a great location. A few shops, restaurants and bars close by too and coffee shop within the hotel lobby too. ",4,2019,06,04
228,Great Dublin Hotel,"This was the first night on our Trafalgar tour and we were pleasantly surprised they included a nice hotel. Quite a contrast to some of the dumps we have been in with Trafalgar. It appears to be new and the service was perfect and very pleasant. The breakfast buffet was extensive and good. Modern electrical outlets, usb and beautiful recessed lighting. Coffee/ tea/ hot water brewing pot with all needed condiments.  The location is very good. 
I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,06,03
228,Great location,"Great location, very clean and comfortable rooms.Staff was very helpful and I would definitely stay again. I enjoyed the bar for a nightcap after a night out with family. You can walk to many nearby  attractions, restaurants and bars.",5,2019,06,03
228,Great Location ,Stayed here for one night before traveling outside of Dublin.  Found the location very convenient when exploring Dublin.  Many restaurants within walking distance.  The famine memorial is directly across the street.  Found the staff to be friendly and the rooms were clean and tidy.  I would recommend this hotel when staying within Dublin city.  ,4,2019,06,03
228,Great trip headquarters,"This is a great place to ease into a new city/country.  It is a mix of american comfort and Irish hospitality.  We cannot pick out one staff person as exceptional as they all were very welcoming.  You can easily walk to O'Connell Street or across the river to Trinity College area.  It has a pick up for 2 of the Hop on Hop off buses. The green bus is better for pick up or drop off.  You can pay on the bus right there, cash only.  The room we had was very comfortable and quiet with ports to charge phones and computers, but not 110.  There was a refrigerator, which is very nice if you like to keep items for light suppers.  The Irish breakfast was excellent.  Due to food allergies I cannot eat many breakfast foods, however there were cold cuts, cheese and a wide variety of fruit.  They do make custom omelettes, fried or scrambled eggs and hard boiled eggs which is unusual.  They also  have sausages, english bacon, hash browns and my favorite cooked mushrooms and tomatoes.  My husband enjoyed the self made waffles and peanut butter on toast.  You will hear many different langauages in the dining room and lounge.  This was the only place on this trip that I found a laundry room.  It was very busy, so if you find it empty better use it right then.  Because of its close location to the cruise ship docks there were many people staying before joining their cruise.  The hotel is also used for tour groups.",5,2019,05,30
228,Value for Money,"We have a very pleasant stay in this hotel, because of their friendly staff and great breakfasts. There are bus stop at the door of the hotel which goes to the airport. The restaurant of the hotel is well lighted and spacious and there are a lot of choices of food. The room itself is quite basic but very comfortable. However, the location of our room is not too satisfactory in a way. At first, we were given a room at the corner on the 1st floor. I felt I could nearly touched the top of the passing busses down below. Then we requested to have our room changed, and this time, we were given the room on 4th floor , but this room was facing the back lane with the houses opposite to us.",4,2019,05,30
228,I'm gonna return!,"I stayed here for about two and a half weeks in February. It was my first visit to Dublin and was here for work. Hilton felt like home. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful at all times, the rooms were tidy and clean, and I had a river-facing room (I'm very particular about my window view no matter where I travel). I loved the food, the breakfast spread, the friendly bartender, and the close proximity to all the happening places while sufficiently away from the noisy party streets. On my next visit to Dublin, this is where I'd like to stay. Would I recommend this to others? Oh definitely yes!",5,2019,05,24
228,Wonderful helpful staff,"We had a 3 night stay here.   The staff were beyond helpful, they went out of their way to answer our questions about the city and tours. Joanna on the front desk was particularly helpful to secure a dinner reservation on an evening when there were 2 concerts in town.   Would recommend this hotel for service and location.   ",5,2019,05,24
228,You won't get any sleep,"Stayed here last night as my flight landed at 0200, for a sleep before travelling further. I made it clear to reception that I would like a quiet room- I was allocated 524, which has an adjoining door (my absolute nightmare-upon my return to reception I was told that there was no other room available). A late check-out was declined however I bear no grudge about that. It happens depending on next day occupancy that's fine. I got to sleep at 3am, to be woken exactly five hours later by Americans in the adjoining room, discussing with gusto their itinerary for the day-it was as if they were standing at the end of my bed. When they left 30 minutes later, the Housekeeper decided to turn over their room, banging a vacuum cleaner into the adjoining door. Then, despite the fact that there was a DND sign on the door, at 0910 she knocked on my door and walked in!! I only wanted one thing from the Hotel, some sleep, and they failed miserably. Business travellers will know that there are hotels where you can rest, and there are hotels where you can't. Unfortunately this falls into the latter category. It's a shame, as its aesthetically pleasing and has potential. It just lacks communication between departments when a Guest makes a perfectly reasonable request, and Staff who lack the necessary training to deliver the Hilton brand.",2,2019,05,24
228,A Solid Four and a Half.,"The Garden Inn is located near to the river with easy access to the train station and an interesting flat walk to many attractions.
Our king deluxe room had a great view of the river and was very comfortably furnished.
Pre-stay emails were answered promptly and requests granted. Diamond HH benefits included an excellent room upgrade and very early check in.
Staff were friendly and efficient.",5,2019,05,24
228,Good hotel,"Location: 10-15 minutes walking to Trinity and a little bit more to the region of Temple Bar. It’s just in front of the river. Nice area.

Breakfast: good with a lot of options.

Staff: okay. Some were more helpful then others but in general it was very pleasant. The  waiters of the restaurant were very nice. The restaurant itself is very good.

Room: very cozy. Good bed, shower and have safe.",4,2019,05,23
228,Good location for certain sites.,"We stayed here a total of 4 days.  1 when we first arrived in Dublin and then after a quick overnight in Belfast back for 3 days.  Rooms we nice.  Beds were very hard, some people like that, I don’t.  Staff was super nice and attentive.  Our only issue was, the evening we got back from Belfast, it was 10:20 pm, we we asked the front desk about food, they said the bar served pizza till 12.  We went right in, it took forever to get service, the. At 11:05 we finally ordered 2 pizzas, drinks took forever too.  At 11:45 I asked about our food, the 2 bartenders on stuff looked confused, one went to the kitchen and came out with a cold what was to be goat cheese and spinach pizza, but was mozzarella and spinach, never the less it was wrong and cold.  At 12:10 we got the Hawaiian pizza.  We told they guy the other pizza was cold, but we ate part of it because we were hungry.  He asked if we wanted another and we told him, no thanks.  5 minutes later we got another pizza, still made with mozzarella.
My husband asked what kind of cheese it looked like, the bartender didn’t know.  At the end, we did not pay for any of it, but it was a bad experience.  I know it’s always important to share the good, and the not so good.",3,2019,05,22
228,Perfection,"We recently had the pleasure to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn prior to a cruise. Our stay was for 4 days. The The Hilton Garden Inn was the perfevt chouce for our pre-cruise stay in Dublin. HGI is a stop on the 757 bus from the airport. The bus literally drops you outside the front door for 6 euros per person. Could not have been easier or cheaper!
We arrived at the hotel about 10:30am and we were pleasantly greeted. My hubby has diamond status with Hilton and it was acknowledged and appreciated. I told them that he spends more time with Hilton than he does with me! Our room was ready for early check-in. Yay!
We were assigned room 725. As we made our way from the elevator  I remarked ""no way, a corner room?!"". As we entered, we were thrilled! It was a suite complete with living room, work space, 2 queen beds and a large bathroom. The view was gorgeous!!! This was our first trip to Ireland and I joked that we didn't want to leave home base!
The HGI is conveniently located to many sights. The Irish Emigration Museum is right next door. The stop for the hop on/hop off bus is just outside the entrance. We walked to Trinity College, Grafton Street and the Temple Bar District with ease. Connelly Train stop for the DART is a 5 minute walk and we took the advice of our breakfast waiter to explore Malahide on our own. It's a quaint seaside destination with Malahide Castle and gorgeous park and grounds.
Speaking of breakfast, HGI has a great selection of breakfast items to get your day going, including a cook-to-order omelette station. We enjoyed burgers and beers at the restaurant our first night there, as well. Breakfast was comped from hubby's status, but our dinner/drinks were great and reasonably priced. 
I should also note that HGI is equipped with 2 washers and 2 dryers at $3.50 per use. This was clutch to get our wardrobe back to 100% for our cruise.
The staff was very pleasant regarding any question or request. We can't say enough about our experience at the Hilton Garden Inn. Do yourself a favor and book now!",5,2019,05,20
228,"Great hotel, super staff!",We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at Custom House Quay for 4 nights. We had a terrific time. We had a wonderful room with a king-size bed on the top floor with a view of the city and the liffey period the staff was very helpful in providing directions on how to get around the town and we were close to most of the attractions within walking distance if you are in decent shape. we would stay at the Hilton again.,5,2019,05,19
228,Fantastic stay,"Stayed at the Hotel from May 7-14.    Fantastic location, within walking distance of all the popular areas and tourist attractions.    The rooms were spacious, the staff friendly and the breakfast was awesome.   If you leave before they serve they will make you a breakfast to go !!!!  Highly recommend.",4,2019,05,16
228,First Ireland visit,"Can’t say enough nice things a joint this hotel. Friendly staff , nice clean and quite hotel on the east side. Especially wanted to say the Issamdine , one of the supervisors, was extremely nice and helpful during our stay. It is people like that who make a trip nice. If I ever revisit Ireland, I will stay here.",5,2019,05,16
228,"Great location, wonderful staff, good breakfast, comfortable bed.",Arrived early morning on the express bus from Dublin Airport (€12 roundtrip). Bus stop is in front of hotel. My room was ready so they let me check in early. Lovely view of the river and a quick walk to all the sights in Dublin. Staff were super friendly & went out of the way to help us enjoy the first time in Ireland. Rented a car right around the corner at Europcar and parking was only €13 for the night.,5,2019,05,14
228,Nice Hotel On the River and Walking Distance from Temple Bar etc.,"This hotel is very nice, is in a good location and all staff were very professional and helpful. The rooms are clean and seem new or newly refurbished and the entire property is very bright and nicely decorated. The river is across the street, and there are several bridge nearby. It is a pleasant 20 minute or so walk to Temple Bar area and there are many other restaurants, bars and shops closer to the hotel. Would definitely stay here again - value, quality and location all very good.",4,2019,05,13
228,Excellent choice in Dublin,"Great location, excellent staff, fantastic breakfast, great restaurant and bar. Easy to get there by bus from the airport which stops right outside the door. $12 Euros round trip. Walking distance to the centre and tourist areas.",5,2019,05,13
228,Great location for family ,"One of the issues for family travel in Dublin is finding a hotel with 2 queen beds to a room.  This hotel does it.  Recently remodeled, walkable to everything, adjacent to the EPIC ( emigration museum). The pub in the hotel was relatively busy and the food was decent and reasonably priced.  Breakfast buffet was perfect (free for Hilton members, sign up). The rate was pricey but it was really about having the 2 queen beds in the room for us. Parking is at an adjacent car park, hotel will stamp ticket for half price but still 18 a day.    Staff at counter very helpful.  Snack kiosk by front desk.  Gym ok, small but useable.  Would stay here again.",4,2019,05,12
228,Very good location,"Garden Inn by Hilton is very well located in the heart of Dublin city. It is around 10 mins walk to City center (O'Connell's street- where most of the tours begin), 12-15 mins walk to Temple bar, Trinity university.
We reached Dublin from Galway and our bus also dropped us at Eden Quay and the hotel was 10 mins walk. The airport link bus stops right at the gate of the hotel and takes 25mins to reach airport.
The hotel room was decent, we were given a room at the back side, so not much of view from the window.
Overall it was a good stay for one night.",4,2019,05,12
228,Super nice staff and great location,"Very nice Hilton Garden Inn, perfect location to everything. Close enough to be where it all happens, but also far enough away, so there is no noise in the evenings.
Staff is super friendly, and make it nice to be a guest at the hotel.
Airlink Airport busses 747 & 757 stops right outside the hotel, it can't be any easier, and 500-600 m away, there is a train station.",4,2019,05,10
228,Brilliant stay,"We stayed here for three nights whilst on a mini break in Dublin and we had a great stay. It was our anniversary whilst there - we were upgraded to a river view room and the staff had also put a card and chocolates in our room. This was a really nice touch. The hotel room was very good, spotlessly clean and had everything that we needed. All of the staff that we spoke to were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel is in a great location, very close to the shopping area and Temple Bar. We would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return next time we are in Dublin!",5,2019,05,07
228,Good Hotel Great Location,"The Hilton Garden Inn on the river in Dublin is a stylish modern hotel that places you within walking distance of most of Dublin's attractions. The hotel has a nice bar, a good token operated laundry and a good restaurant. Very comfortable and if you have a room on the right side of the hotel lovely river views !",4,2019,05,07
228,Great location and nice hjotel,"Perfect location for exploring the city or just hitting the Temple Bar. 

Two stops on he airlink bus 747 and your at the door. About 5-10 minutes walk to city center and Temple Bar so away from the noise of the bars. 

Very clean room had hairdyer , iron and tv. Great breakfast. 

Hihghly recommmend I will be using again.",5,2019,05,07
228,Attending Concert in 3 Arena,I found this hotel to be in the perfect location for a concert in the 3 Arena and it is only 10 mins walk to the train station.  The lady who checked us in was very polite.  The room had a double and a single bed which were very comfortable.,5,2019,05,07
228,Not a typical Hilton ,"My husband and I stayed here recently for a couple of nights. Our stay was okay but that’s it. I did expect a little more from a Hilton and for the price paid, however, the room was fine. It was clean and there was a safe and a mini fridge in the room which was much appreciated. The bathroom was equip with amenities but the shower had very little pressure. The bed was comfortable. The location is a little way away from things but the Airlink and the hop on hop off bus stopped right outside which was very convenient! There was a restaurant on site but no where to get water, snacks, etc. You had to walk 5-10 mins away to get to store to buy these things which was a little annoying. There was renovations going on while we were there so perhaps there might be a shop in the future! Keep your expectations low, don’t expect a North American Hilton, and you won’t be disappointed.  ",4,2019,05,06
228,Brillant. Would stay again!,"Stayed here for 2 nights. We were attending a concert in the 3Arena one of the nights. 
This hotel is in a perfect location, 15 mim walk to the 3Arena, 10/15 mim walk to O'Connell street and Temple Bar areas and 5 mins to the bus station. 
The hotel was clean, staff were very friendly and accomodating.
Room was clean and everything you needed. What I especially liked was the fact the hair dryer was actually decent, it wasnt attached to the wall in the bathroom so you could actually dry your hair in the bedroom and you didnt have to hold the button in continously to keep it on! The room was warm but there is a temperature regulator in the room so easy fixed. There was also an iron and tea making facilities. 
Breakfast had plenty of choice and we ate dinner one of the evenings and it really was delicious! 
We also parked our car in the multi story carpark behind the hotel. They will validate your ticket which gives you a discounted price. Still €18 a night but very handy and good to know your car is safe and secure.
I will definetely stay here again, especially if attending a concert in the 3Arena. ",5,2019,05,03
228,Very good location but not great value,"Stayed at this hotel as we were getting picked up very early in the morning for a trip to the UK.  Disappointed with room size and with the lack of friendliness/attentiveness of the staff at front of house
Staff in the bar very good not just with us but with each guest.  While I did not eat in the bar, the menu looked good, prices good and people around me eating seemed very satisfied.  ",3,2019,05,03
228,Best of Dublin,"This was a great place to stay. Excellent location, near Connelly Station and short walk to Temple Bar. Started each day with their breakfast, very good! Check in and check out were a breeze and I found the staff helpful. I used the gym a few times and it was perfect  for a quick workout. I will stay here again for sure.  ",5,2019,05,02
228,"5* for hotel, 1* for bathroom flooding","The trend in hotel bathrooms appears to be an open shower design where there is no lip between the shower area and the rest of the bathroom. Our hotel in N. Ireland had a similar shower. The result is that water can easily flood the whole bathroom floor. There was a drain of course, but the entire floor did not slope towards it, so water pooled by the toilet and by the sink. 

The real issue is that there is residual mold in there. They do a good job scrubbing most of the actual black marks away, but my husband is allergic to mold, and he had an allergic reaction as soon as the floor became wet. When he left the room, the symptoms improved immediately. He spoke to the front desk in the middle of the night, but they couldn't or wouldn't give him a new room to sleep in, and they also wouldn't let him sleep in the lobby. So he came back to our room and we had to open our windows, which helped his breathing but made the room extremely cold. By that time, all of us were awake and cranky. (FWIW, the other hotel we stayed at with a bad bathroom design also had puddles of water on the ground, but they did not trigger an allergic reaction. In fact, this was the first time it ever happened in a hotel.)

When we checked out, they gave us a 40 euro discount, which was better than nothing I suppose. 

Everything else about the hotel was nice as other reviewers have mentioned. If you don't have a mold sensitivity, this hotel is great. Unfortunately, my husband does, and we had a very unpleasant night.",3,2019,04,30
228,"Nice Hotel, dreadful service.","Stayed here over the weekend, it’s a nice hotel, recently refurbished, it’s a busy spot, bright and cheerful..apart from all the staff!
Checking in was typical of the staff attitude/apathy we were to experience, they were all .generally unpleasant...
At no stage did the receptionist even look us in the eye...we were a severe inconvenience to them!  So unpleasant, unwelcoming and disinterested!
We were just instructed to put out card into the machine, handed a room key and that was it, god forbid that we were welcomed to the Hotel 🙄!
This attitude followed in Oly’s bar and restaurant where we ate...we ate at 5pm, our order was taken immediately and it wasn’t busy, which was good as there appeared to be only one waitress and one manager on duty, however it did get very busy around 530pm.
Other staff arrived but our food didn’t appear until 555pm...a full 55 minutes after ordering..a very long wait for burgers..very frustrating as we were heading out to a show!!! The burger was shrivelled, dry and over cooked, it was supposed to be a brisket burger, and we did eventually manage to find a sliver of brisket on the bun!!!
Why it took 55 minutes I have no idea!!!
However, the staff managed to get both the food and drinks order confused with the table next to us so one of us got fed and one had to wait an extra few minutes!!! 
I was incorrectly served the chicken burger, that looked ok, certainly better than the beef burger!!! I also had a side portion of supposedly truffle fries with aged Parmesan, I’m still looking for the truffle oil!!!  At 4.95e for the chips, you’d expect a little more than a shake of very dried crumbs over chips!!
So Not worth the money!!
When we went to pay, chaos ensued, as they added two tables together (random strangers), and couldn’t understand why I was only paying for two dinners and drinks...that took 15 minutes to sort!!!

The beds are actually nice to sleep on, the pillows too, the towels are good quality.. I have no complaints in that regard but the whole place is left down by the staff!!
Their attitude alone stops me giving 4 stars!

The next morning I went to the bar counter for 4 take away coffees...i stood waiting whilst the lady took 17 minutes to make them...I kid you not..17 minutes to make 4 takeaway coffees...
Please instill some customer service skills to your staff, they are dreadful!!!

We were two of a group of people and everyone agreed with me, in fact, my son in law, approached a receptionist asking where the advertised vending machine was, he followed their direction and ended up outside at the back of the hotel next to an ATM machine, when he came back into the Hotel, the receptionist said he did not know what a vending machine was, this will tell you the calibre of the staff!!
One question....why?...",3,2019,04,30
228,Great hotel,Family of four stayed here for six nights. Hotel has great breakfast and good sized rooms for Europe. The epic museum and urban brewery next door were great. The bus stops right in front of hotel for easy access to airport. Train station is also close. Decent walking distance to most Dublin attractions including having to walk through some tough areas. The amount of walking was tough for my kids and we eventually did some taxi trips. Overall was very pleased and also found hotel affordable.,4,2019,04,29
228,Excellent Location for Convention Center Area,"If you have business near to Convention Center in Dublin this is a property with excellent location only few minutes walking. Good internet speed, room cleanliness and confort bed. Airport bus link connecting the airport just in front. ",5,2019,04,29
228,"Excellent Hotel, Staff and Location","My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights at the end of March and was excellent from start to finish. A lovely welcome upon checking set the tone for our whole stay. The room we had was clean, spacious and had everything you would need. Added bonus having an iron and board in the room which normally I have to request from most other hotels. The breakfast was very good with a wide variety of breakfast items and a chef making fresh egg based items and pancakes. The Hotel is situated in a great location where the airport link bus stops and picks up from right outside and it's only about a 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area. All in all a most enjoyable stay and would certainly recommend to all. Staff always pleasant and helpful and a credit to the Hotel.",5,2019,04,26
228,Lovely clean & hassle free,"Me & my husband arrived early for check in, The nice receptionist told us our room was ready and let us have our room straight away so no hanging around waiting.
The room was good size and clean ,with a perfect view of the river liffy.
Breakfast was great , plenty choice and hassle free , we ate out for dinner/tea .",4,2019,04,24
228,vacation,"I travelled to Dublin with my family (wife and two kids). We arrived at 8am and they allowed us to check in early. In fact, they upgraded us to a larger room. Staff was very friendly and breakfast was good.",5,2019,04,21
228,Bright clean and friendly,"We stayed here for the proximity to the River Liffey and short walk to downtown. The FD staff was welcoming and informative as they often helped schedule taxis for my mother in law; she has a hard time walking and wasn’t always up to walking to the Molly Malone statue where many tours begin. In the restaurant, consider yourself blessed by Ireland if you have Diego, Richi, or Michael as your waiter.",5,2019,04,20
228,Great hotel,The hotel is located right by the river and you can walk to all the major tourist attractions from it. There is also a car park right next door and the exit opens up to the hotel. The check-in and check-out procedure was nice and simple. The room was clean and spacious. Unfortunately the pressure of the water was not so good though and that could be an easy fix.,5,2019,04,19
228,Great hotel,"Location was very good, though a bit further from the main downtown attractions than expected. Our rooms overlooked the river and were very nice - good overall size, larger beds than expected and very clean. Breakfast buffet was very good. ",5,2019,04,17
228,MANAGEMENT TERRIBLE,"We went here as part of a tour stop and were highly disappointed.  There were 3 trainees that assisted us Amy Bradley, Maurtis and Lorna who were more sympathetic and ready to make things right.  This is our story.  On April 11,  2019, we went in the hotel restaurant named Oly's #53614.  We ordered a steak medium rare and a burger with coke and tea.  We were very hesitant of our waiter if you want to call him that.  It took 10 minutes for him to acknowledge us just for drinks.  Then the same or more to place order for food.  My husband wanted another soda and we had our waiter ignore us three times after he saw us wave him over.  My husband finally walked out of the restaurant and bought a soda from the gift shop area.  We finally got our meal about half hour after ordering with steak perfect but burger over cooked.  Again we were not able to get the attention of the waiter for the bill and got so upset we went to the front desk complaining and to pay the bill.  There was another couple walking by who overheard us complaining and agreed saying they had terrible service the night before.  The front desk manager dismissed himself to talk to the restaurant manager saying the steaks take 25 minutes to prepare offering no resolution.  We charged the entire restaurant bill to our room not believing what just happened.  The menu nor the waiter advised us the steak would take so long and why.  Hilton's guarantee is published all over the hotel stating 'Our goal is to make your stay better and brighter.  If something isn't just the way you like it, simply let any hotel team member know; and we will make it right guaranteed.'  Obviously, this is not so with management.",1,2019,04,15
228,More convenient spot than it looked,"Stayed here three nights in February 2019.  At first glance it didn't look like a convenient spot because it wasn't right in the midst of things, but it was directly on city bus and tour bus lines and within reasonable walking distance to the Temple Bar and other areas.  Our room was small but had a nice view of the River Laffey. (Definitely pick a room with a view if you can!) I did have some issues with the wait staff one night and customer service - although a few agents were absolutely wonderful, though.

I left some clothing in the room when we checked out and called from my next location in Galway. I asked if it were possible to send my items over to the Hilton at the Dublin Airport, since I was staying there the night before our flight home. I was told that wasn't possible since the two hotels were not connected. I agreed to come back to the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House to pick up my items when i returned to Dublin to fly home. I checked multiple times to be sure the items were available at the front desk but when i arrived it took staff a REALLY long time to find my bag of clothing.  I would have hoped it would have been marked or placed in a more obvious ""lost and found: place since I'd called a few times. Eventually, someone did find it, so it was a happy ending.  

But overall, I'd recommend this hotel for its proximity to transportation and view of the river with a nice walkway. It's also right next to the EPIC Museum which was a great stop to make on our tour of Dublin.",4,2019,04,15
228,Bad service,"Bad restaurant staff. Had to ask several times for drink refreshments. Then had to ask for dinner receipts. 
Also was given a $500 euro note at the airport. We asked the frontdesk to make change for it and they pretty much laughed at me saying they had never seen a euro that large",2,2019,04,14
228,Business in Dublin,"2 night stay in Dublin. Hotel staff was very kind. I arrived 3-4 hours before Check-In but the staff was happy to accommodate me with a room. The room was very nice. I had a great view of the river. Mini fridge and safe in the room. Bathroom was nice. Hot water in the shower is a must for me and boy was it hot! The beds were super comfortable. They provided a four pillows, two were fluffier and two were less fluffy also you had a choice to meet your preference. Fitness center is a little weak. There were four people in there and it felt pretty cramped. Two treadmills, one elliptical, one stationary bike and one “hand” bike. Breakfast was great. Plenty of variety with the food...fresh cooked omelettes are available. The one thing I didn’t like was the chair in the room sits very low compared to the table top space, even when it was in its highest position. I absolutely plan to stay here during my next trip to Dublin. ",4,2019,04,12
228,Great Location in Dublin,"We stayed here as part of a group tour.   Hotel is in a great location right on the Liffey River.  The hotel staff was very friendly.   Rooms were spacious.  Bus stop right outside the hotel was a convenient way to get to the airport - only 6 Euros per person.

Would definitely recommend and would stay here again.",5,2019,04,08
228,Great place to stay in Dublin,We were in Dublin as part of a group tour. The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House was the perfect place to visit the city. Especially helpful was the onsite self service laundry facility. We left with zero complaints.,5,2019,04,07
228,A decent hotel,"We stayed here while attending a family wedding. Now in fairness I don't have a great history with the Hilton's in general as most I have stayed at are well below standard. However.

This one pleasantly surprised us. The staff were exceptionally helpful especially the restaurant staff who on the morning of our arrival kept the breakfast room open for us past closing time even though we hadn't booked in yet. 
The range was impressive including make your own waffles if desired.

The room was spacious with all the mod cos kettle safe iron large TV etc.
The rooms had the option of bath shower or just shower.
My only gripe is that the door in room 401 needs attention as there is a 1/4 inch gap around the door frame and the door which let's in a lot of light from the hallway lights at night.

Overall this is the only Hilton I would absolutely recommend ",4,2019,04,06
228,3 nights in Dublin !!,"We rented a car nearby at Spencer Dock and the hotel was the closest to the rental so we stayed here at the Hilton,some of the best nights of sleep we got here,the rooms were clean and quiet and with in walking distance of several sites,also a 10 euro ride to about anywhere in town,",5,2019,04,04
228,Nice location! Great restaurant and bar!,"Great size room!  Shower and bath tub.  Room facing the water was nice.  Easy walking to almost everywhere.  Airbus stop is right outside the hotel.  Delicious bar snacks and ales in the restaurant.  Wonderful breakfast!  The staff was amazing; giving suggestions for places off the beaten path.  About 1.5 miles from Temple Bar, Dublin Castle.  The comfort of the hotel is worth the walk.",5,2019,04,04
228,What fun we had!,The  hotel was clean and the staff was very kind. Our room was very cute and over looked the the water. We were able to walk every where we wanted in Dublin. We had a family reunion there so there was 18 of us and couldn't ask for better accommodations. We would stay there again.,5,2019,03,31
228,Weekend trip to Dublin,A very pleasant and reasonable hotel.  We were made to feel welcome from the start and all staff we came into contact were very welcoming.  Rooms very comfortable with all amenities including a safe.  Very good breakfast buffet with lots of choice. Quite near to centre and also hop on/off bus and bus to airport right outside hotel ,4,2019,03,30
228,"Decent location, good value.","Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Hotel was quite clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was quite good, and the restaurant for dinner was also good.  Location was decent.  The bus stop for the Airlink bus is right outside the hotel.  Just a heads up, that it is a little bit of a walk to get to Temple Bar or O'Connell street.  Would stay here again.",4,2019,03,29
228,Excellent Location!,"My husband and I stayed for 3 nights in this very nice hotel. Room was large, spotless and had everything we needed. Tea/coffee making facilities, hairdryer, safe, iron and ironing board and plenty of drawers and hanging space for clothes.
On arrival we were allocated a room which when we entered was already occupied! Fortunately there wasn’t anyone in the room at the time just suitcases! We were quickly given a new room and complimentary drinks for the bar.
We didn’t have breakfast so cannot comment on that but the bar area was nice with a relaxed atmosphere.
The hotel is in a fantastic location. The bus stop right outside takes you to the airport and back in around 20-30 mins depending on traffic. It’s a 12-15 minute walk along the riverside to get to the Temple Bar area and a bit shorter to the shopping area. Obviously a bit far if you are not very mobile but it’s a steady walk for those able bodied and it’s a beautiful view along the city.
I would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again in the future.",5,2019,03,28
228,Great Location,"The location of this Hilton was surprisingly perfect.  Close enough to everything (shops, pubs, restaurants, tram, buses) for walking purposes but out of the way of the nightlife noise.  The hotel is located next door to the new EPIC museum and worth a visit as well.",5,2019,03,27
228,Nice 7 night stay while in Dublin for Business and Pleasure - Good location for exploration of city,"I've been to Dublin on 7 occasions over the past 4 years for business, this was the first time staying at this property which is now the closest hotel to my work's new office location.  I stayed at the hotel for 7 nights and enjoyed the stayed.  Besides being close to my work, the hotel is also in a good location.  It is a few blocks from the Customs House and about 10 minutes to O'Connor street and 15 minutes to Temple Bar area.  Over the weekend took day tours where the pickup was on Upper O'Connor which was about 15 minutes away.  I also explored the area east of the hotel which offer several restaurants, pharmacy and a SPAR convenience store along with a Bank of Ireland ATM around the corner all within 5 minutes walk (Plus a couple of restaurants in the Epic center next to the hotel.)  

Regarding the hotel, the rooms were large enough and clean and had a nice partial view of the river.  The only complaint of the room, I wish I had a full shower rather than bathtub with shower head.  The tub wall is high to step over.  The room was quiet, never really heard anyone from the other rooms or hallway, even though the hotel was booked.

I got the breakfast package when booking the hotel and glad I did.  They offered a little bit of everything and I would eat as much as I could as I would skip lunch on occasions.  There is also restaurant and bar on site.  I did not eat at the restaurant, but it was crowded on occasions, especially when tour groups were staying at the hotel.  I noticed a lot of room service, and seemed the speciality was pizza.  I did enjoy the bar.  The bar had a nice beer selection and bartenders were also great and helpful.  The bar also would get crowded at times, but that was ok, you can just walk over to the common seating area or just take your drink to your room.  

For those who would take the Airport Bus, the bus stops right in front of the hotel.

I plan on staying at this hotel again next time in Dublin for business.",4,2019,03,24
228,Short break,"Excellent service lovely room and facility's
Olly's bar and restaurant staff were excellent courteous and always respectful to all.
There was a lovely friendly atmosphere whilst Maintaining professionalism",5,2019,03,24
228,Good hotel,"I stayed at 5 hotels as part of an Irish trip in March 2019.  Overall, this hotel was the best one. Although, they did give me a scare when I checked in - I had arrived too early to check-in so dropped off my suitcase and went sightseeing, when I returned they had difficulty locating my suitcase, it turned out someone had moved it from one room to another!",4,2019,03,24
228,Great place to stay,Good location; nice rooms and amenities; good food in restaurant; plentiful included breakfast; fantastic staff who give excellent customer service; fitness center available in house; business center right off main reception; staff very accommodating when asked for information or directions.,5,2019,03,23
228,Unworkable Room and Issues With Dealing With Celiac Disease (In Ireland!!!),"First of all, if you have ever had to travel with food allergies, it is not a treat. I have learned to try and ask for things that are naturally gluten-free and make my requests as simple as possible in every way. i had picked Ireland as a location for this vacation as it has the world's largest population of fellow celiac sufferers. So when the restaurant was unwilling to make a separate breakfast for me as I can't eat off the buffet and actually served me off the buffet after we made our special food request several times and explained it, I was livid. No one in the restaurant seemed to understand celiac disease, including the manager of the restaurant, who was the one who gave me food from the buffet. It began when we talked to the hostess who, after hearing we wanted food made for us, made me write down my order, then did nothing with it. Eventually we spoke to the Assistant Manager, who merely handed us off to the Restaurant Manager. After we had the issue with being given food directly off the buffet (exactly what we needed to avoid because of my food allergy!), we were eventually given the custom prepared meal of scrambled eggs and bacon. The ""remedy"" we were offered for additional days was to ask for room service, trusting them fully to not give us food off the buffet again (ha!).

The room was also very suboptimal. The walls are paper thin. We were actually woken up at 6:00 AM by someone in the next room running a hair dryer, which was a first after many years of staying in hotels. The thermostat for the rooms is an energy-saving one, which means that it turns off constantly, resulting in you having to reset it constantly. The room is either too hot or too cold. Additionally, the decor in the room is very plain and ugly.

Additional issues with the hotel: 

Cannot take the stairs; door is locked at ground floor
Need to use card key for the lift at ground floor
No service for helping with luggage
Staff at desk in a tourist town unknowledgeable about the area. (We had a list of things to do we had made and wanted help in figuring out what was nearby. Staff was unable to help, instead referred us to all-day bus tours. We had to spend additional time in the hotel room figuring out logistics.)

Pluses:

Really liked the electric tea kettle - very handy, easy to use and heats up quickly
Included refrigerator 

Summary: I would avoid staying at this hotel if at all possible. We were forced to, as it was part of a Globus tour, but I would not go back willingly.",2,2019,03,23
228,Unforgettable 21st birthday visit!,"We spent my friend’s 21st birthday in Ireland the weekend of St. Patrick’s Day. The hotel was super central and had a bar/restaurant. The rooms were modern and clean. Our room of 4 particularly was amazing, I’m pretty sure they’d upgraded us because we were on the top floor and had an entire suite. Staff were lovely and so helpful. Only criticism I’ve got is when we tried to drink in the bar there were couples sat on the massive sofa tables which would have easily sat our group of 8 and we didn’t have anywhere to sit. There were lots of 2’s available spread about the restaurant. Staff should really tell people to move when it’s that busy and they’re sat on their laptops taking up a chair, especially when we’re hotel guests not just tourists popping in and wanting to stay sat at a table. One waiter was lovely and let us sit in the restaurant part as opposed to the bar, but others made us feel like we couldn’t sit there when there was literally no where else to sit that was anywhere near each other. We paid a lot of money to stay there! All in all a lovely stay though!",5,2019,03,21
228,"Nice hotel, good location","I was here for 3 nights (work related) and was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The reception staff is friendly and helpful, I had a nice room on the 7th floor but unfortunately i had a shower and I prefer a bathtub...
The breakfast is continental and very good. The coffee taste can be improved.
Overall a good hotel, a bit expensive but quality has a price.
The location is at the river near the city center, you can walk to your favorite bar or restaurant in the city.",5,2019,03,20
228,Great hotel,Great hotel near the airport. I spoke to Maria at the front desk and she was so kind to my daughter who was traveling from Paris. She helped with the shuttle and also arranged for breakfast for her the next morning since she was leaving before breakfast was served. She loved the room and had a very nice stay. ,5,2019,03,18
228,Great location overlooking river,"Lovely hotel in a great position, short walk along river to centre and Temple Bar, bus stop for airport bus right outside of hotel, food in hotel restaurant excellent although bar slightly overpriced.  Our room was very comfortable and clean overlooking the river and very quiet.  ",4,2019,03,17
228,Dublin Bus Trip,"Ireland Trip To/From Dublin on Globus bus journey.  We spent the first two nights in Dublin at the Hilton Garden Inn and our last night.  Porperty is close to the tram line, so youcan get around town quickly and cheaply.

Rooms were great and best of all was the includwed breakfast.",5,2019,03,17
228,Consistently good.,"Have stayed here on several occasions and have always enjoyed it. Location is great, rooms are top quality and the staff are friendly and helpful. Can be a bit pricey given the fact there's nothing special about it but that's usually the case with hotels in Dublin anyways.",5,2019,03,16
228,"Perfect Location, cozy Facility and Outstanding Staff","The staff went above and beyond on helping me make my trip to Dublin memorable. Everything about the facility was perfect. All questions answered and great suggestions to the local sites. Close to Temple Bar area which is a highlight of the city for dining and entertainment. Transportation was also advised for ease, most economical and efficiency. Hotel is within walking distance to 3Arena if you are in town for a show as I was. 
",5,2019,03,15
228,"Hotel good, situated within walking distance from everything, service not so good","The Hilton Garden is a nice hotel, just by the river Liffey. It's a bit pricey but the dates and the geography was attractive. Also, as being a Hilton Honors member I booked through the Hilton website. As being a Hilton Honors member I received a welcome letter at check-in, telling me how much the hotel value me. But they didn't get me my room, despite pre check-in, and several hours of prep time. When I tried again, front desk promised to fix it. So then I tried again another 45 minutes later, so they told me to fix it again. Eventually I got my room and some coupons for the bar. 

We stayed several nights, and one other afternoon we asked the reception to book a large taxi for us. They wasn't too eager to do this, so they told us to take the tram in stead. So we took two taxis outside, which cost us more, and wasnt as convenient, but at least got us to where we wanted. 

So, the hotel itself is nice and situated very well. But the service level at front desk is very disappointing (and the front desk manager was involved without taking any action).",3,2019,03,13
228,Great location in Downtown Dublin,"Good location, close to most things of interest. Bus stop outside the front door. Easy bus ride from the airport. Great view of the river, and the EPIC museum is next door, as well as a Starbucks for those who enjoy that. The workout center is small but adequate. Same for business center.  Other than not having a jacuzzi, this is a perfect place to stay if coming to Dublin! ",4,2019,03,13
228,"Great hotel, perfect location","Excellent hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Location was brilliant and the room was comfortable and quiet.

Location close to O'Connell Street. Tour buses stop outside.15 mins walk from 3 arena.  Epic centre next door is an interesting exhibit.",5,2019,03,13
228,Great location,"Have had mixed luck in the past finding a hotel room for three close to the 3Arena but we’ve cracked it with this hotel. The room was spacious, the beds were very comfortable and it is only about a 20 minute walk from the venue (and about 20 minutes in the other direction takes you to the high street shopping area of the city). The hotel bar was nicely busy with a relaxed atmosphere late on Saturday night. There was what seemed to be a very well stocked snacks/ice cream/soft drinks area in the foyer and there are tea/coffee making facilities in the room. There’s also a car park right behind the hotel and the overnight rate is €18 if you get reception to validate your parking ticket. Couldn’t fault this hotel at all and will definitely book again next time we’re heading to the 3Arena.",5,2019,03,10
228,Avoid!,This was the one and only time I will stay here. I booked this hotel based on location and reviews. The mattress was like sleeping on a concrete slab with a pillow. I developed food poisoning that I suspect was from the terrible beef cheese burger at the restaurant. I was charged approximately 30 euros for a “premium” that showed up on my emailed receipt for a location that falls short of what one would expect of a Hilton branded property. Needless to say I would never stay here again.,2,2019,03,07
228,Very nice hotel,"Stayed 2 night at this hotel,our room had the river's view which was fantastic.
The room was very clean,bed comfortable and very fluffy white towels.
Staff at reception very helpful,nothing was  a problem. Would definitely recommend it.",4,2019,03,07
228,Very pleasant hotel,"This was a business trip and for me this was the 2nd time in the hotel.  Last time was a couple of years ago and I must say the hotel positively surprised me now. I arrived very late and check in was the fastest I ever experienced. It was quick and efficient, and most importantly with a smile. Room was nice, with a big closet and  a spacious bathroom. The shower was good as well. I slept well in the queen size bed. An important point for me is always the wifi and if there are enough power sockets. Wifi was very good with high speed internet fast enough for Skype and Youtube/Netflix. Next to the bed and the desk were enough power and USB sockets which I found very useful. 

The location of the hotel is great, a short walk from the center. 

Summarized a good hotel which I will certainly come back to, actually already next week when I am in Dublin again for 2 nights.",5,2019,03,06
228,Great Location for walking,"Great location for walking into city center the pedestrian bridge is across the street, easy access to great shopping and restaurants.  the room is nice and roomy beds are very comfortable good linens.  The bathroom is a good size with really nice big soft towels.  very functional room.  Had good nights rest and a wonderful breakfast in the morning.  You can even enjoy good coffee from Cosi for extra charge but if you like espresso, cappuccino you will appreciate it.  You can even get an omelette fixed to your order, good selection of breakfast food.  we really enjoyed staying here, staff is very helpful and nice.",5,2019,03,05
228,You won’t sleep!,"The walls are paper thin, the slightest noise in the other room is somehow amplified. You can hear everything, you can hear next door on the toilet, you can hear them snoring, you can hear them packing their suitcase or drying their hair. If they put the Tv on at 7am you might as well put your Tv on. 

We had one half of an adjoining room so it was awful, so loud and disappointing considering how much this hotel cost. 
",1,2019,03,05
228,Wonderful 60th,"What a wonderful hotel, so clean, staff very friendly. Couldn't fault the food. You can make your own waffles at breakfast!! Yum!. But the most important comment to make for this hotel is, there were 14 of us who stayed for the weekend,on Sunday 2 of our party including the birthday girl, were left stranded at Dublin airport (by Ryan Air) at 2am my friends contacted the hotel explained the situation,and were told to get straight back and the hotel would make sure there were rooms available for them. What a difference in attitude to Ryan air, the customer service at the hotel is impeccable, once they made it back to the hotel, they were told to get some sleep and not worry about paperwork, as that could be sorted later. The hotel should be very proud of their staff. I would recommend them always",5,2019,03,05
228,Perfect location for a visit to Dublin ,"Spent 3 days here.to get here the 757 airlink stops right in front of hotel,so going to and from airport it’s a perfect location when you have a family and luggage to drag around.the do Dublin green hop on hop off bus also stops right in front of hotel so you can get a quick lay of the land.for my tours that picked up and dropped off on O’Connell it was a easy 10 to 15 minute walk with plenty to see,do and eat on the way there and back.temple bar is about 15-20 minute walk away.we did laundry and it was $3.50 euro to wash and $3.50 to dry so that was convenient and pretty cheap to do your own laundry.we ate at Oly’s the hotel restaurant and the food was really good.breakfast at the hotel was good as well and front desk was very helpful.when we needed to leave early for a tour they had breakfast in a bag waiting for us.the one time we had hotel get us a cab to temple bar area it was $12.50 to get us there.",5,2019,03,02
228,It's grand.....,"Stayed there for a Friday night and things were generally fine. Room with river view was nice and all encounters with staff were good. It's a fine location with easy access to theatres and very close to city centre.
Two small niggles - there was no bottled water in the room which in this day and age and for this quality of hotel I would have expected.
Also buffet breakfast was very busy ( which is normal) but kept running low on dishes such as bacon ,fried eggs or sausages.which typically meant going without. A first world problem I know but unusual to see at this level.
That said neither of these small points would put me off and I'd be happy to go again.",4,2019,03,02
228,HGI Dublin Custom House,Pleasant enough stay at this hotel the reception and dinning area appear quite pretty however there was an issue with checking in which shouldn’t have taken anywhere as long as it did. Room was river facing however sadly there is a building opposite which slightly obstructs what otherwise could be a decent view. The room also felt rather empty with the layout.,3,2019,02,28
228,Dublin Hilton Garden Inn Custom House,Very good location for attractions. Breakfast buffet excellent. Restaurant had excellent food and bar made excellent craft cocktails. Bus stop for Airlink to and from airport right outside the hotel. Short walks to train stations for destinations outside Dublin City. Great Stay!,5,2019,02,27
228,"Comfy, convenient and reasonably priced.","My partner and I stayed here for a long weekend in February 2019.  The room was small but efficient and included all the usual stuff, a safe, a small fridge, tea service etc plus a nice view of the river.  Our room and the common areas were clean and neat and all looked fairly new.  The hotel was a little bit outside of the typical tourist area, but we never found the walk to be too far and who doesn't like a stroll along the river?  The staff was always friendly and helpful.",4,2019,02,23
228,"Early Check In, Upgrade. Lovely Hotel. ","Recently returned from a weekend break in Dublin and were very satisfied with this hotel.

We arrived early to the hotel, not expecting to be able to check in for several hours and requested facilities to store our bags. We were greeted by a very friendly member of the reception team who chatted to us about our plans for the weekend and our journey to Dublin. It was a very welcome surprise when she found us an available room and we could check in immediately. This really set our stay off on the right foot. 

Whilst not advised on check in, we also discovered that our room had been upgraded, from a queen room to a king with a city view. This was also a very nice gesture which improved our stay further.

The room was very clean with beautiful modern interiors. Comfortable bed/pillows/linen etc as would expect from the Hilton Brand.

Whilst we didn’t use the facilities the bar and restaurant looked very nice also.

We were also able to access complimentary free WiFi throughout our stay. 

The hotel is in a great location, alongside the river and right next door to the EPIC museum, it’s approx. 10 mins (flat and easy) walk to Temple Bar and shopping area. Guinness Storehouse was approx 30 mins walk. 

For those visitors on leisure break, offering some recommendations of restaurants or places to visit would enhance the experience further.

",5,2019,02,23
228,Good view of the city!,"We stayed here as a family of four. For a European hotel room, the room was a very good size. The staff was very kind and helpful. It’s right on the river so there were nice views of the city. It’s close to public transportation as well. It’s a good place to stay for a decent amount of money.",3,2019,02,21
228,Good Location for Dublin Visit,"We stayed at this hotel for three nights.  It was being renovated into a Hilton Garden Inn, and the work being done was great.  I selected the location due to the proximity to the Temple Bar area, and the hop-on/hop-off for touring Dublin is outside.  The staff was great, and the room was comfortable.  We even used the fitness room and it was very nice.",4,2019,02,21
228,"Great location, extremely comfortable","I stayed here on short one night stay. 
The hotel is in an excellent location, well serviced by public transport.
Reception staff are very friendly, rooms are very comfortable and the breakfast has a great variety to offer.",4,2019,02,19
228,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel is in a great location. The Airlink stops not too far from the hotel, and the Hop On Hop Off buses pick you up right outside the hotel. The staff is very friendly. We had a king size bed, nice room size too. Plenty of USB ports. ",5,2019,02,18
228,Decent Hotel ,Stayed here in January for one night. Check in was fast and the girl was friendly we got a late check out with no issues. Room was a standard room shower was good also had a bath but didn’t use. View out our window was just to a wall of the building beside us. The breakfast was good and we’ll replenished. Can’t comment on the price as we were upgraded here by another hotel but we were very happy with hotel. ,4,2019,02,16
228,Beds hard and noisy rooms,"Hotel is OK if you get a good price, but the beds are hard and the doors slam shut and the noise from people talking in the halls travels into the rooms.  Rooms that overlook the river are nice for a short stay, and main attractions you can walk to.",2,2019,02,15
228,Don’t bother,"Stayed here for 3 nights last weekend in a basic room at £170 per night that was sold as a river view room.
Specifically requested nearly 4 months prior a high floor on booking.com. We ended up on floor 1 outside the bus stop and taxi area so noisy and not a high floor. We had to keep the windows open as our room was so hot. Add to that the windows kept slamming shut as they had no retainers just a piece of cable that was useless.
The showers were terrible, were small and had no pressure. We thought it was our shower but the two other couples who were with us had the same issue.
If you want to order room service for eg fish and chips is €18.50 plus you will then be charged a further €6 for them to bring it to your room.
Overall not the best. Every morning we had to set out our own 6 seater table to accommodate our party as the maximum tables were for 4. On a number of occasions they ran out of breakfast items with my wife and friends waiting about ten mins for some hash browns. I would not stay here again and I’d advise anyone to look at other options.",2,2019,02,14
228,Chilly experience,"This hotel is in a great location on the banks of the river with the city tour bus and the airport link stopping right outside.
Hotel Very clean and we had room 430 with a lovely view over the river.
Unfortunately on the night of arrival the room was very cold but blamed ourselves for not operating the air conditioning properly however we complained to reception in the morning and they advised they would look at it.
We arrived back in the evening to 2 plug in heaters - both switched of so room still freezing. Got one to work but other did not even switch on so reception arrived with a replacement so eventually the room warmed up.
We advised reception in the morning about the problems but the foreign receptionist did not even offer an apology . Poor show Hilton!!!",3,2019,02,10
228,The last night of our tour,"We stayed here on the last night of our tour.  It was a short night because we had to get up extremely early to go to the airport.  We did not stay in our room for any lengthy time.  We got a room as far down the hallways from the elevator as it is possible to get, which wasn't a happy surprise for me.  The room was very comfortable and well accommodated. I was very happy to find a step-in shower. The bed was comfortable. We did eat lunch in the hotel restaurant. It was not memorable, but it worked at the time. We were given a small sack breakfast prior to leaving for the airport. It was also not memorable, but it helped get our day started. The hotel is in sight of the Samuel Beckett Bridge which is really beautiful. We walked around the block to the back of the hotel to catch the light rail to the Temple Bar area. We took a taxi back and it was not expensive.",4,2019,02,10
228,"Excellent Location, Facilities and Service","A long weekend for the  opening 6 Nations game and a really good choice hotel for lots of reasons. Normally know what to expect from the Hilton brand and this place delivered well. Location is great being just on the North side of the Liffey in what a appears to be a smart regenerated  area but only 15-20 mins amble into the city centre and or Temple Bar etc. Excellent reception/bar/breakfast restaurant staff.....very efficient. Bar food good (handy very late at night) and breakfast choice/quality excellent. Room spotless and comfortable. Take a high room if poss looking out across the river. 618 had a great view with the snow capped hills in the background. Loved the really big walk in shower.....so much better than a shower over a bath !

Room a little pricey but of course thats supply and demand for Ireland v England (or any other major rugby match) encounters at the Aviva (25min walk)

Difficult to find fault and would certainly book again.

Tip.....if travelling to/from the airport the 747 bus stop is right outside the hotel and runs several times an hour. 11 euros return as opposed to circa 60 euros + and is virtually just as quick as long as you dont mind sharing a double decker bus with others! We enjoyed the views from the top deck !",5,2019,02,06
228,A Tale of Two Rooms,"This is a modern hotel situated adjacent to the Liffey and a pleasant walk of about 10 minutes to Connolly Street. We went as part of a party and were pleased to find our rooms ready on arrival at 10.45am and an accelerated check in process - a relief since we were last off the coach!

Service was excellent and the breakfast (well stocked) and bar staff were friendly and attentive. Bar snacks were served promptly and well presented.

We had two rooms and I would recommend that you ask for a corner room such as 413 - which has a shower but no bath. This was on the front and had a double aspect overlooking the river which made our companion's room look rather dismal. I would have liked an occasional chair or two in the room to sit and read the paper for example.",5,2019,02,04
228,Home for a weekend of Rugby,"We were in a Hotel full of thorough bread Rugby fans..
The  Staff were great and coped so well with a very full hotel and they were always attentive the rooms were fully serviced and clean as was the whole hotel....the bar staff were good before and after the game....and we had had a few by then but they looked after us all...
Breakfast before the game with big burly men filling up.to cope with the amount of beer they knew would be consumed but they kept the breakfast coming ....
And the same the morning after the GREAT WIN...
Thank you people you were just great...",4,2019,02,03
228,"Excellent service and rooms, highly recommend",Excellent experience from check in to check out. Gorgeous river view. Nice rooms and very friendly staff. Bed was super comfy. Breakfast had a great range and was really good quality. Highly recommend this hotel.  Will be back!,5,2019,02,03
228,One night stay ,"Myself and a friend stayed here for one night in order to see a concert in the 3 arena. The hotel is within walking distance of the three arena and near a Luas stop, to allow ease of access to the city centre. Our room was lovely, comfortable and no noise disturbed us for the night. We enjoyed a really nice dinner in the hotel restaurant too. Staff were very friendly right the way through from check in to check out. ",4,2019,01,27
228,Great stay in Dublin!,"Enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Dublin Custom House Hilton Garden Inn. Staff was friendly and quick to help in any way they could. Room was comfortable and clean, and the location was excellent. Can't wait to be back!",5,2019,01,22
228,Lovely Central Hotel,"We stayed here for 5 nights in early January.  The staff were extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  Breakfast buffet in the morning was nice.  We had dinner in the restaurant twice and enjoyed the food and the prompt service.

Our room overlooked the Liffy River and was quite comfortable, if a bit small.  Housekeeping did a great job for our entire stay.

There are two busses that take you express to the airport for 7 euro.  We used them on the way in, but just took a cab on the way out.  We took the regular busses throughout the town, but you have to walk a bit to catch them.  We discovered that the tram/overground train stops right behind this hotel, and seemed a bit easier to use for the immediate area around the hotel.  Found a nice sushi restaurant right behind the hotel as well.

Very conveniently located and lovely staff.  Also, this hotel has a laundry room, which was very useful, as we had been traveling for quite a few days prior to our stop in Dublin.",5,2019,01,19
228,Lovely updated hotel,"Highly recommend. Good transport links. Lovely views. Quick check in, let us check in really early too which was welcomed. Would go back, after our first disaster visit this made up for it and would always stay here visiting Dublin. Just wish there was more food options outside of hotel. ",5,2019,01,16
228,Over night trip,Me and my 3 friends stayed in the hilton for the night.. the room was nice clean plenty of space for all 4 of us.. no hair dryer in room but other than that we couldn't fault it.. good location its about 10 min walk from all the bars and shops.. we didn't eat or drink in hotel so cant comment on the food.. we would stay here again ,4,2019,01,14
228,A pleasant stay,"A lovely hotel with a great view to the river! Clean with big rooms. There is also a cafeteria, a bar and a restaurant in the hotel. The breakfast was very very good. Highly recommended for a pleasant stay in Dublin!",5,2019,01,13
228,Holiday,"The hotel was great, very helpful. It’s in a great spot in Dublin so it’s easy to get around. The bartender Stuart took care of us the whole trip and made the hotel worth wile. He added a great and genuine aspect to the hotel.  Highly recommmend! Check out the bar!",5,2019,01,10
228,A few days in Dublin,"Wonderful location and great stay in every regard, we would stay there again, in fact we booked again for our final  night after a driving tour of Ring of Kerryt!~ there were 2 couples traveling and had a great stay",5,2019,01,10
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House,This Hilton garden inn in Dublin is very close to the custom house and also to some attractions in the area. Everything in Dublin is walking distance and this hotel sits close to the Samuel Beckett bridge and the custom house. Our room is very clean and really nice. The breakfast is also very good.,5,2019,01,08
228,Great Location on River Liffey,"This hotel is spot on. Rooms are a good size with fantastic showers. Staff v friendly and helpful. Choose a room with a river view. You won't be disappointed. Discounted parking available. The bar is open until 1am. A much needed bonus was the guest self service laundry,  handy when you're on the go everyday. ",5,2019,01,08
228,Absolutely fabulous!! ,"Visited this hotel with my husband and another couple for the weekend to celebrate my friends 50th birthday in Dublin. Location is fab, 20 mins from the airport!! Right on the river Liffey a short walk from O’Connell Bridge!! 
Check in was very easy and our room was lovely!!! 
Modern, clean and spacious, as was the bathroom. 
 Breakfast was hot and delicious each morning with lots of choice, including fresh waffles and omelettes. 
The bar area is comfortable with a nice ambience!! 
We ate in the restaurant one night and the food was amazing!! Tiger prawn starter and mushroom risotto were sooo good!! 
The staff in the bar and restaurant are absolutely lovely, so friendly and helpful!! 
I will definitely return!! ",5,2019,01,08
228,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in this wonderful hotel for one night, as we were going to a show in the Bord Gais Theater. It was close to the theater, had fantastic staff and was excellent value. It was clean and spacious and even though we were on the road side of the hotel, we heard no street noise and slept well. It also had a lovely atmosphere and had a great breakfast, plenty of choice and had fresh omelette s and waffles on the menu too. Will he staying here again for definite.",5,2019,01,06
228,Great location and service,Highly recommend this hotel. It is a great location for all the major activities in Dublin — all within walking distance. Service is great and price is very reasonable. Right next door to the EPIC museum and just down the road from the Customs House.,5,2019,01,06
228,Very modern and well-located,"We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn over Christmas. You can easily arrive from/depart to the airport via the bus. While not in the middle of everything, if you do not mind walking 10-15 minutes, you will be. 

The breakfast buffet is superb. The gym, while small, is modern. It was nice to have a mini-fridge in the room for beverages. The rooms are a bit on the small side, though.",5,2019,01,06
228,Lovely stay,"We stayed here from 1st Jan to 5th Jan.
This was our first visit to Dublin, we weren’t disappointed.
The hotel is on the 757/747 bus route from the airport, bought a leap visitors card €19 for 3 days, €7 each way to, from airport. Took about 20 minutes.
Warm welcome from check in staff, lovely family room, room 314 overlooking the city and river. Never heard any road noise been only three floors up thought we might.
Room was clean and spacious enough for the three of us. Only slight complaint was that the room got a little chilli in the early hours, but the duvet was warm enough.
Breakfast was lovely, so much choice and all items of good quality. Served by very friendly staff.
All areas of city are very walkable from here with maybe the Guinness store house been the only one where I would recommend taking the tram too, tram stop 3 min walk from hotel and included on the leap card.
Overall our first trip to Dublin was fabulous, I don’t know why they don’t sell themselves more on a Christmas destination as the shops,light displays and city wide decorations were stunning. We will be back and we will be staying at this wonderful hotel.
",5,2019,01,06
228,Nice place to stay,"Good hotel, friendly service. Fine location by the river. It’s easy to walk from there to all city centre locations and it’s right next door to the modern immigration / emigration museum, EPIC. 

Room and beds were comfortable with efficient Wi-fi. Nice breakfast and the bar is better value than many city centre pubs - good for a nightcap!

The regular and quick 747 and 757 buses from the airport pass the hotel, which is useful. However, these buses are busy and can be full for the return journey to DUB. So leave time. ",5,2019,01,05
228,very clean and good location,checkin via honors app was comfortable but just limited tov1st and 2nd floor.checkout was very efficient and comfortable.coffee in morning should be possible not just when taking full breakfast.staff was friendly but not always offering solutions for customer needs,4,2019,01,03
228,Family Visit,"Very nice hotel, in a good location.  

Our 2 Queen family room was very spacious with a fantastic layout. 

Restaurant had a very good breakfast and great late night pizza, only wish it was offered at dinner time. 

Excellent staff. 

Only issue was mini fridge never got cold. ",4,2019,01,03
228,Concert trip,"Posting for my mum Sybil who stayed in December: I loved everything about this property, staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, both on arrival and checking out, I also asked a few questions online and was answered very promptly and accordingly,  room was spacious and bright and extremely clean, the hotel was easy access from Heuston station. Bar staff were very friendly and the food was divine both at breakfast and dinner. I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2019,01,02
228,Theatre trip,"Lovely hotel and brilliant central location for shopping and theatre breaks.  Very clean. Located beside the emigration centre, across from theatre, custom house and literally round the corner from the bus and train stations. ",5,2018,12,29
228,Excellent!,"This was my second stay and it was great both times! Comfortable beds and accommodations. Thank you! I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone. The staff was very friendly and helpful, also!",5,2018,12,28
228,"Location, Location, Location","The mostly good with a bit not so good:
 
First: the title says it all!-- incredibly well located- a bridge across from Dublin center--a corner up from the Connolly train station (which we took to Belfast), the DART, which we took to Howth (rhymes with growth), and the tram and the bus. The farthest touristy place is the Guinness Storehouse- you will want to take a tram or bus there as it is a very hefty walk. It is a few blocks from the shopping mecca of O'Connell Street, near the Abby theater, etc.

Suggestion and issue: Buy a visitor Leap Pass from the airport and hop on Bus #747-- the stop is directly in front of the hotel- IGNORE directions on the website- they are wrong. Buy the Leap Pass at Spar at the airport- for one or more days- it gives you unlimited rides on the DART, bus or tram- simply swipe the card on the pad as you enter. BTW, for the DART, you need to press a button to open the door of the train and again when you want to leave at your stop. We used the DART to go up north to Howth- a lovely place to walk along the water- beautiful views and you can climb the cliffs if you have energy.

Accommodations: what you would expect for the Hilton brand- we are gold members and like the Hilton for this reason- clean, comfortable, (good nibbles at night at the desk)- ample breakfast (if you Honors folks choose not to take the points). 
My issue: NO American TV station- they have Al Jazeera, a Russian station and UK stations NOT ONE American station- we arrived on the  night our government shut down and wanted some news-- not to be had - how can an American chain not have one American station (forgive my little rant)?

On to the good: Great restaurant I believe the name is Oly-- we were too tired one night to go out to a pub- surprisingly good meal and reasonably priced. 

I will be reviewing amazing pubs and sights during our visit to Dublin-- what a wonderful city to visit -- on our first morning we met Neill who will soon be starting his own touring company - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly-- we got incredible heads-ups on places to see and eat- also, one of the highlights of our trip was the train ride home from Belfast- for one full hour we got 4 riders to compete with each other for what they thought were the best pubs and restaurants-- so much fun- and we went with the final consensus: Le Bon Crubeen (around the corner from the hotel-- more on that later)!!",4,2018,12,27
228,Best Hotel ever,Highly recommend this hotel! All staff in the hotel went above and beyond to help us. No mater what we needed they were there. Beds welcoming/shower hot/they will call for a cab/give directions/make recommendations. Fantastic food and great Guinness beer!,5,2018,12,26
228,Good experience but also not so good,"We were here for an extended weekend stay. The Hotel in itself is very good with good amenities, good clean rooms, comfortable beds, great shower with good water pressure, hot water etc, and a good location. However we are not so sure about the security at the hotel as it is a big negative point that the hotel left the door to our room open for over half a day with the latch sticking out for everybody to walk in when we were out in town for the day. So that when we returned from the Theater late in the day we first had to worry if there was a burglar in our room and thereafter spend time to go through all our belongings to check if anything was missing. I called down to the reception immediately to inform them and ask if they had left the door open for some reason. And they only told that they would check around with maintenance if anyone had been working on the room (although we thought this would be odd as everything was working fine since we arrived so it would be a poor excuse). There was no further follow up from the hotel after the incident. Nobody checking with us whether we were missing anything from our room or even to apologize in any form. Of course this makes us question the security at the hotel and my wife had to live with the fact that all our belongings can have been seached by some stranger (we will never know).  Maybe it isn't a big deal for the hotel that the customers don't feel secure - news flash: it is a big deal to the customers. Besides this the hotel is in walking distance from most of the central sights and is located just by the river. Unfortunately since the above incident happened and since there was no follow up from the hotel staff I cannot give a better rating than 3stars although I really wanted to give five stars which it would have been without the incident and perhaps four or five if the staff had made any effort to follow up on the incident. All in all a very good hotel with a customer service and security that could be better.",3,2018,12,23
228,A lovely stay..,"We were in town to see Les Miserables in the Bord Gais theatre. As my husband is a Hilton Honours Diamond Member we usually use our points to stay in town every couple of months. We had honeymooned in this hotel when it was still a Jurys Inn and within weeks of it becoming a Hilton Garden inn we had visited. Nearly 2 years on all I can say is Wow. The place has gone from strength to strength. Lovely warm foyer with decent bar/cafe area incorporating Costa Coffee. The staff were all so friendly and check in was efficient and warm. We stayed in room 434 which had a view over the Liffey. The room was spacious, comfortable and with tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge it had all we needed. I especially liked the Facecloths in the bathroom. The breakfast was very good with lots of choice and an omelette station. The hotel doesn't have it's own carpark but there is a multi-storey around the corner and you can avail of a discount although at €18 a night it's still quite pricey. 
Overall we had a great stay and will definitely return. ",4,2018,12,23
228,Stop over 2 Spain,"Nice breakfast, a little east of the city center, hard beds, but nice ... probably will not stay here again. Nice staff & not far from O'Connell train statio, but a little off the central area & strange showers.",3,2018,12,19
228,Excellent Stay As Usual,Stayed here last Saturday night. Extremely comfortable room. Fantastic shower and the toiletries of Shampoo & Conditioner were very welcoming. Quietest hotel room we ever stayed in even though it was road facing. Bar food very nice and breakfast is exceptional. Variety of breakfast items is out of this world. Really appreciated the mini shop in the reception area for items that I had forgotten to pack. Thank you for a really lovely stay.,5,2018,12,19
228,Great Experience,"Booked this hotel to do some Christmas shopping in Dublin, was very pleased with the whole experience with the hotel, great and helpful staff, the room was brilliant even included a mini fridge , very much enjoyed the restaurant and the staff were super friendly.",5,2018,12,18
228,⭐️ an extra star...,"Visited here with my wife last weekend of the final night of her surprise birthday trip for her birthday to see Josh Groban concert in 3arena. 

Check in: quick, painless and very professional/kind staff

Our room: with a view over the Liffey and the Jeanie Johnston boat, although facing the main road, the traffic was impossible to hear.

Location: about 15 mins from 3 arena and very quick access through port tunnel from airport. O Connell street about a 15 min one walk also. 

Restaurant: we ate dinner and breakfast here. One of the best steaks I have ever had. Restaurant and bar staff were incredibly kind. (kudos to Ricchi 👍👍). Wife had some cocktails (cucumber gin that she said were out of this world). Breakfast was also very nice, omelette and waffle station! Great idea.

Extra star for: my wife lost her hat on check out - we called the hotel to check. They called back after another person had handed it in. They even posted it to Cork for us. (Thanks April and Mary!)

Recommend to stay here for sure - good location, great experience!",5,2018,12,18
228,First trip to Ireland,"Nice view of the river, the lights were beautiful. Great nights sleep. Very helpful staff. Gave options for getting to multiple stores.Convenient parking.Very convenient location to public transportation.",5,2018,12,17
228,One Night in Dublin!,"The hotel itself was nice and the employees were friendly at reception. We came in early and asked if we could drop our bags off and they actually set us up in a room!!! 

It's also in a great location - close to the Temple Bar District and there is a bus stop right outside to take you to the airport.

I don't like writing bad reviews.... but there is a bar/restaurant located on the main floor. My friend and I decided to have a drink there before going out to the Temple Bar District. I went up to the bar and ordered 2 drinks. I sat back down and about 20 minutes later (yes I waited that long), I went back up to the bar and said that I think my drinks were forgotten about. No problem they said, they'd bring our drinks right out to us. So I go back and sit down..... we waited another 10/15 minutes. Finally my friend goes up and talks to a waitress and we get our 2 drinks - plus he had ordered a shot of espresso - which she said she'd bring right over to our table. The espresso never came and nobody asked for payment. I could have walked right out of there without paying but that's not my style. When I went to pay, I had to tell them what I ordered. I was extremely displeased with the customer service, especially when it wasn't even that busy. It should not take 3 times to get 2 drinks served.",3,2018,12,17
228,No room ready,"We booked this hotel for a break away to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We arrived on Saturday at 3pm soaked through with the torrential rain and were looking forward to getting to our room to change out of our wet clothes. We were informed at reception there were no rooms ready and to wait in reception until they made one up.
After 20 minutes my husband approached reception and eventually were given a room.
Our stay after that went smoothly. Nice rooms, good breakfast and pretty close to the 3arena, where we went to a concert.
I have rated this hotel as a 3 as although it was a lovely hotel our first impression was not a good one.",3,2018,12,17
228,Brilliant stay,"3 of us stayed here in a twin room, we arrived at the hotel nice and early and managed to get lucky getting a river view room. We stayed in room 513 it was large spacious and very clean. W what a mini fridge too. The view was stunning and we were very happy with the modern style bathroom. The room has good heating and a big tv, great for qhen we got in from the cold december days. The staff at reception were friendly and helpful ordering our taxis and dealing with any querries. I would definitely recommend staying here. The bus from airport dropped us right outside and we were only about 10 min walk from shops and 15 minute walk from temple bar. The emigration museum next door is part of a shopping centre that does good coffee and cheaper breakfasts and there is a spar just round the back of the hotel where you can pick up any drink or stuff you may need. ",5,2018,12,17
228,Friends get away,"On getting here the staff was really friendly and helpful in advising us where to go and what to see. They gave us a good room with a view over the water they even let us check in early. 
On getting to our room which was a great size for 3 adults sharing. 
We got reception to order us a taxi into the town even though we are only a short walk away from all the restaurants and bars. 
The beds are comfortable but the pillows are somewhat to desire, they are a bit thin and not firm or padded out. 
Overall was a great stay would stay again just need to bring my own pillow. ",4,2018,12,16
228,"Great place to stay in Dublin, would recommend","Stayed here in December 2018 for two nights over a weekend. Was given a complimentary room upgrade on arrival thanks to being a Gold Hilton Honors member as well as complimentary breakfast and free water. Room was lovely on the top (7th) floor with a view over the river. Plenty of room to move around with a massive bathroom and big bed. Not a bad location, little bit of a walk to the city centre or Temple Bar. Breakfast buffet was great with lots of options. Also utilised the laundry facilities which were good. Would return.",5,2018,12,15
228,Lovely hotel,We had lovely time in Dublin Ireland  excellent area good hotel excellent management room very good  every where tidy staff very friendly  polite  god break fast I don’t have any complaints about this hotel recommend ,4,2018,12,15
228,Decent hotel ,"This is a decent hotel. Rooms are comfortable and clean. I could hear the person in the room next to me snoring which was annoying... It's a busy hotel and they serve good coffee down in reception. Location is OK, its very good for 3 arena and the Bord Gais Energy Theatre.. It's about a 20 minute walk to St Stephens Green. There is handy parking at the side of the hotel. The area is safe and quiet. ",4,2018,12,09
228,Great place to stay,"We like Hilton as you know what you are getting for your money and this one didn't disappoint.
You can get the airlink bus from the airport for 12eu return and it stops close to the hotel. The 747/757 but I cannot tell you which one as on the day we traveled there was some route changes.
We were able to check in when we arrived at 11am which was perfect.
The room had a very comfortable double, mini fridge and safe, armchair, hard chair and large wardrobe.  The shower worked powerfully and great hot water.  

The lobby area has some soft seating and a few shelves of snack items to buy then leads into the bar/restaurant. 

We only had breakfast one day and that was  continental for 10eu. I don't recommend it as next door is CHQ with Insomnia and other cafes that were cheaper dependng on what you want. The problem was the tea they were using was not that nice and it's made with hot water that's not really fresh, you know the water machines. I prefer a pot of tea, but that's personal choice. The food choice was excellent, fruit, cereals, toast, bagels, small pastries, 2 kinds of cheese, cold meat, 3 types of juice etc. The toast would have been better if they were either using a better machine or bought it to you as it just came out looking the same as when the bread went in. They were trying to fix it but as toast is key that's why didn't go back again. We could see the full breakfast, again with a good choice and eggs cooked to order. There is a discount if you pre-book the cooked option the day before of a euro.

We used the bar several times with great and friendly service but I'm not convinced on there hot drink and cake deal for 7eu which we did but i'm sure it was cheaper to buy separately.

We were able to store our luggage upon check out. They had a great city map and it was really only a 15min walk along the river and you are in Temple Bar. We walked to Guiness apx 40mins I guess. There is a tram stop a 2 minute walk from the hotel called Georges Dock too.  Location was brilliant, quiet in the evening. If you come out of the hotel and go left there was the Irish version of Pizza Express, if you went right to CHQ there is Urban Brewing and Tapas - both were good.

We did struggle communication wise as none of the staff appear to have English as there first language, particularly at breakfast but we got there in the end. We did have an issue with the bedding being feather to which I am allergic but got it changed, so again good customer service. I do find Hilton let themselves down here as being an Honors member the profile you set up should let you state things like this and then you never have to remember to add it to each individual booking.  

We would definitely choose this hotel in this location again.",4,2018,12,08
228,Excellent,"Excellent  stay for 2 nights. Room amazing as newly decorated, location great. 20 mins walk to 3arena, 20 mins to temple bar. Staff polite. Shop in foyer- water 1 euro - cheaper than shops. Airport bus right outside.",5,2018,12,03
228,Business ,"Lovely comfortable hotel ideally based near convention center. Friendly staff, nice food, just a tad slow serving. Room was clean and quiet despite overlooking the street. Overall very happy with my four nights here",4,2018,12,03
228,Good hotel for short stay in Dublin.,"This is a great choice for a Dublin city break, and we stayed there for 2 nights at the end of August.

The hotel, whilst a standard Hilton Garden Inn, is a well designed and well run hotel with good facilities and is in a good location on the banks of the River Liffey.

Our bedroom was clean and well equipped, and hotel restaurant and bar are comfortably furnished. Breakfast in the hotel was really excellent with a wide choice of hot and cold food served buffet style. Service in the bar was good.

The hotel is within easy walking distance of the city centre and its many bars and restaurants, and is only a short distance from the ferry terminal.

Overall a good hotel for our Dulbin break.",4,2018,12,03
228,"Honest employees, great place","We were there on a very busy weekend, Nov. 8th and 9th. We had a corner room with two double sized beds. It was cheaper than a king bed and was fine for us.

The shower could have been cleaner and this was the only issue we had.

Black out shades worked great, even though it' s on a busy street, we slept well and didn't hear street noise.

We had the unfortunate experience of leaving our passports in the safe and heading onto Belfast. Once in Belfast we realized our error and called the hotel. I spoke with April at the front desk and she said she would look into it for us. Five or ten long minutes ended with her finding our passports and letting us know that they would be in the office for us upon our return. The next day we returned, found April, and got back our passports and the cash that was in the passport holder. We were so pleased and happy. Honesty and great customer service.

I would stay here again in a heart beat.",5,2018,11,29
228,Well located for Connolly station,"This is a typical garden Inn Hotel, reasonably fresh with great rooms, many of which have river views

we travelled by Train from Belfast, it is a very short walk through the IFSC to the hotel. there are lots of busy restaurants down the side of the quay, the emigration museum is right beside the hotel and the airport bus stops right outside.

Great place to stay if you need an overnight before a flight as the bus goes through the docklands tunnel and drops right at the airport door.

Staff are friendly, there is a reasonable bar food menu and we were upgraded to a river view deluxe room which was very comfortable",4,2018,11,28
228,"Very Good Hotel, No Complaints","I booked a 4 night stay at this Garden Inn. The hotel is clean, comfortable, and the staff are helpful. The rooms are modern and spacious and the location is very good, right on the River Liffey with an abundance of public transportation and airport shuttle stops nearby. If you're looking to go to Dublin on a budget, this is the place to do it. 5 Stars.",5,2018,11,28
228,Good hotel,"We stayed last Saturday night. Check in was fast and friendly. Our room in the sixth floor appeared to be newly done up was large bright and spotless.

Thr only spoiler in thr trip was when trying to having a quiet drink in the bar after the Irish American Rubgy game it was spoiled by a highly drunk Lady who screamed, roared and shouted. At one point screaming at staff asking how to say and I quote ""how to sh*t the f*** up"" in their native languages. I was shocked that she was continued to be served and was not asked to leave/return to her room.

The bar staff themselves were lovely and clearly were annoyed by her as were many guests who left the bar area due to her. 

I would have expected that she would not have been served as a matter of hotel policy.

The hotel's lack of action in this matter has left a bad taste in our mouth and is leaving us considering other hotels in the area for upcoming events in three arena and Bord Gais theatre.

As two buses arrived as we were checking out we did not raise this with the pleasant gentleman who checked us out.",4,2018,11,28
228,"Excellent stay, all around",This hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff went above and beyond to be helpful and the restaurant good was excellent. The location was convenient to the convention center as well as for shopping and sightseeing.  ,5,2018,11,22
228,Nice Hotel in Dublin,"This place is a nice hotel that is fairly centrally located in Dublin. I't not a far walk from Temple Bar and there is plenty of food options near by, The bar area was very lively and the breakfast buffet was very good. The room's were a bit small but comfortable. I thought the price was a bit high but there was a marathon that weekend so I suspect that drove some of the rates up.",4,2018,11,21
228,Weekend break,"Without doubt the best Hilton Garden Inn I’ve stayed in. Large rooms, great breakfast and service. Stayed on a weekend rugby visit, a great river view and quiet room. Within easy walking distance of all the main attractions.",5,2018,11,18
228,Great location ,"Very welcoming at reception - very knowledgable and helpful to the traveller.
Rooms nice and large, well kept and very clean.   Bathroom was well stock and towels nice and fluffy.
Couple of touches I think would make it a 5 star - couple of biscuits with the tea and coffee and a more powerful shower.",4,2018,11,16
228,Convenient Location & Great Value for Price,"The location of the hotel was great, just outside of the bustling city center but close enough to easily walk places. Room was clean and staff friendly & helpful. Hotel does not provide a parking area, but there is a public garage attached to the hotel. Hotel validates parking with a 50% reduction in the parking rate - we forgot to do this when we checked out, don't forget!",4,2018,11,16
228,Nice hotel Nice Location,"Clean and neat.  Nice bar and breakfast area.   Centrally located near City Centre for Pubs,local culture, Museums, 3Arena and more.    Right next to epic museum too.   Hotel staff is friendly.   Rooms are good size for Europe.",4,2018,11,13
228,Central to City Center and 3 Arena,"If you are going to a concert at 3 Arena, this is a FABULOUS location. Very easy walk. I also found it to be a good central location for exploring the city. A short, maybe 15 minute walk, to the city center and a very easy walk to the Connolly train/LUAS station. Close to a variety of food and shopping options with O'Connell street a short walk away. I chose a river view room and couldn't hear any street noise when I shut the double-paned windows. Would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,11,12
228,TRUE REVIEW OF HILTON GARDENS,"Recently returned from this hotel after 3 night stay.

The staff were good,the rooms were very clean and modern. The bar and restaurant were also very good.
The location is a 20 min walk to the centre but there are quite a few bars/restuarants around.
The airport bus picks up and drops off right outside.",4,2018,11,12
228,Will be back,"Fab hotel, amazing breakfast... nice location....bed was very hard ive a bad back it wasnt good for it also room service was only ok but there are loads of lovely restaurants very close by we were just in a hurry to go to a show. But i will def stay here again of not just for those waffles at breakfast....",5,2018,11,06
228,Hotel ,"Hi 
I stayed in the Hotel for 2 concert in Dublin 
The staff were very good the one thing I found was the price of dinner was a bit expensive my wife is a diabetes and the porches were small 
I find this need to be luck at ",4,2018,11,05
228,great location,"Our first day in Dublin, and we stayed at this hotel.  The location is wonderful, and it is a short walk to temple bar district.  Located on the river, and close to everything and on the hop on hop off bus route.  Parking is located around the corner and only 18 euro per night.  The room was very nice, and clean.  It was large enough for my family of 2 adults and 3 children.  The breakfast was huge and very good.  The only reason I gave it a 4 was that we tried to check in at noon after a long flight from the states.  I had emailed ahead of time, and they were gracious enough to allow my 3 children to stay in our room.  However, I had requested early check in, but it was not ready and I was told it would be 3pm at the earliest.  We waited in the lobby, and watched many others check in without any problems and go up to our room.  The front desk did try to get a room cleaned for us quickly, but I wondered why we couldn't have been given one of the other rooms that were ready.  Anyhow, we will be going back and did enjoy the hotel.",4,2018,11,03
228,Good hotel in great location,"The hotel is in the city centre and is within walking distance of many attractions and bus/rail stations. The rooms were clean and comfortable.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The cost was a little higher than other hotels further away from the city centre, but the convenient location and lower transportation costs were worth the value.  Because we arrived well before check-in time the hotel checked our baggage in a secure room.",5,2018,11,02
228,All around solid hotel in Dublin,"I have been staying here for years and finally decided to write a review.
The staff is very accommodating and go out of the way to try to help in every way.
Rooms are very nice and always clean( river view is a must)
Nice restaurant on site along with workout room and business area.
Location is excellent and in the middle of Dublin. 
Plus within a block are nice restaurants and grocery stores.
Highly recommend and worth a stay.",5,2018,11,02
228,Really Good Stay,"Stayed here for a gig in the 3Arena which is only a 15-20 minute walk away. The rooms are of a good size, comfortable and clean. The bathroom is wet-room style and the room had a large TV, safe and team/coffee making facilities. The staff throughout the hotel were really nice and friendly. The bar is really nice and comfortable with plenty of room. Breakfast in the morning was buffet style with something for everyone's tastes. There was also a hot counter serving freshly made omelettes made to your liking which was great.I definitely would stay here again if I was attending a gig in the 3Arena however its just a bit too far outside of the city centre for my liking.In saying that there are always taxi's outside the front door.",4,2018,11,02
228,Great Hotel in Dublin,"Hotel is in a good location, within walking distance to the Temple Bar area and O'Connoll St, next to the EPIC museum. The Air Link bus and DoDublin buses stop right in front of the hotel.  We were traveling as a family group of 5 adults with 3 rooms, and it was a great experience. Clean rooms, great breakfast. We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel one night. Staff was friendly and very helpful.",5,2018,10,31
228,"Great location, felt very safe as a lone traveller","Stayed here for one night on business, my flight was ridiculously delayed so I didn’t arrive at the hotel until 1am but the reception staff we very welcoming and check in was quick and efficient.  I felt very safe as a lone female traveller.  Only a 20 minute taxi ride (€30)  Room really comfy, clean crisp white sheets and I had a room overlooking the river which was great.  Breakfast was delicious the next morning, lots of selection hot and cold. and freshly cooked.  Also a Costa coffee on site.  I liked the late checkout (12pm) too.  15 minute walk over the foot bridge and you’re in the centre of town, great location I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,10,31
228,Exellent Hotel/Beware Car Parking Charges,"Stayed here during Dublin Marathon. Hotel is excellent in many aspects. Location is very central to main city, it is very modern and spotless. The rooms are first class and the breakfast was superb. However be warned if using own car. We arrived early on the Sunday approx. 7.20a.m. and left the following morning just after 10a.m. and were shocked when leaving car park to be charged 33 euro.  I went back to hotel to complain and after some intervention between Hotel and Car park people they gave me 5 euro back. This took the taste of a great stay. I will be more careful if going to Dublin again with car to either agree parking charges or stay at a hotel with their own carpark.",4,2018,10,31
228,Nice place to stay,"The hotel is in a great location.  20 minutes from the airport and a 15 minute walk to Grafton street.  They are also on one of the one-off stops.  Which makes it very easy to use this type of transportation.  The hop on-off bus is a great way to get to many places.

This hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly.",4,2018,10,28
228,Great stay,"Great stay central location,friendly staff..will store your luggage if you arrive early. Great breakfast with a large selection. Central location with many sights a short walk from hotel.rooms were clean ",5,2018,10,28
228,Comfortable & quiet.,"This hotel has been ‘revamped’ since our last visit and we enjoyed our brief stay. Convenient for the Three Arena and Connelly Street Station we stayed while going to the ELO concert.  The rooms were very clean, modern, had all of the usual necessities, wi-fi and was comfortable all with minimal external noise (from the busy road outside) and no noise from the hallways and other rooms.  The bar is typically expensive (for a Dublin hotel) but comfortable. Unfortunately we did not avail of the restaurant, gym and other facilities. Would definitely visit again as long as the hotel remains competitively priced.",4,2018,10,26
228,"Nice property, good food","Great property for my business trip. I was rather busy and had to order room service for three nights and it was quite good. Good location, decent gym, good dining options; not much more you can really ask for!",4,2018,10,26
228,busy hotel ...lots of large groups.,All ok but just too busy with lots of big groups. Very noisy and guests arriving back late after a night out .... all fine if that is what you are after but not if you are looking for a quiet place to relax and have a good nights sleep!,4,2018,10,25
228,Totally satisfied,"We found there everything we are usually looking for when booking accommodation: clean, quiet and comfortable room, excellent breakfast with lot of options, good restaurant. This newly renovated hotel is in a real good location with bus stop in front of the building, including Airlink and Hop On Pop Off. We recommend.",5,2018,10,24
228,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel, very secure, staff extremely helpful & accommodating. Rooms extremely clean and triple glazed windows block out the noise of the busy street brilliantly. Upgraded us and gave us late checkout for free which was very nice.",5,2018,10,21
228,good view of city across bridges,"is ok, very close to Connolly station n easy access to city center across numerous bridges. can be cold n windy s right in front of river. nice view , can be noisy wit wind at night hitting shutters. breakfast was decent , this is an expensive city

s",4,2018,10,21
228,Excellent with only minor flaws,"A newly refurbished hotel conveniently located at the Customs Quay Airlink bus stop. Nicely decorated rooms of average size, nice Crabtree& Evelyn amenities on rather small bathroom. Quiet room but this depends on circumstances as either windows nor doors are soundproof. Very good breakfast. All in all a good deal for Dublin. Happy to go back next time.",4,2018,10,20
228,Not a happy camper,"I was incredibly excited about this trip to Dublin and I set high expectations but, was sadly disappointed. Rooms were small and if your neighbors are noisy, expect to hear it. Speaking of hearing it, if it's windy outside the whistle from the windows will definitely keep you up.  I had the breakfast included with my stay and even that was abysmal, disorderly and disorganized to say the least. Example, I asked for cold water for my table and was told to go ask someone in my section, but I thought ""you work here, why can't you get it?"" It was repeated, go ask someone over there. I was shocked and speechless. Not becoming of a hotel with the name Hilton. The only thing this place had for me was the location other than that not a happy experience.",3,2018,10,17
228,Football visit,"Stayed here a few times now, when visiting to watch the footy 
So it must be an ok place 
Walking distance to Aviva stadium and to the central bar area - so always happy here 

Typical Hilton - friendly staff on reception 
Good clean rooms 

Will stay here in the future again ",4,2018,10,17
228,"Short Stay, but very Enjoyable!","After a week of traveling around Ireland, we spent our last night in Dublin, ready to fly home the next day.  Having traveled a great deal in the states on business, I was very familiar with Hilton Garden Inns. So, I booked one night in Dublin for our family.

The hotel is located in downtown Ireland, in a great location. The hotel itself is either new, or recently remodeled, and is beautiful. The open areas, such as the lobby and restaurants, were very nice. And, our room was extremely nice, modern, and clean!

We had rented a car, so it was a bit of a challenge finding a place to park. But, the hotel has an agreement with a parking garage just around the corner. So, we were able to leave the car there over night. In the morning, we wanted to leave early to get back to the airport. When we walked around to the parking garage to get our car, the place was locked up. Initially, we panic'd. But, when we spoke to the front desk, they quickly escorted us into the back door of the garage, with a key of course, and assisted us with getting our car out in a timely manner.

It was a very short stay, but we we truly enjoyed the Hilton Garden Inn, and would recommend it to everyone traveling in Dublin.",5,2018,10,16
228,Consistency,"My experiences over the years has been that Hilton properties consistently deliver clean rooms and this one also was in the city center. Within walking distance of Temple Bar and Connelly Street, there is plenty of shop nearby as well.",4,2018,10,15
228,Great location for a weekend break ,"Lovely clean hotel - nothing over the top - in a good location with great views from some rooms. Very few criticisms of this hotel except the price which is eye watering for this standard and does not include breakfast despite being silver Hilton honours members. There is parking at the back of the hotel in the ifsc car park for another 18euros per 24 hours. 
Shame about the price but would stay again when we’ve saved up!
You could at least include coffee and croissant in the morning😎
",4,2018,10,14
228,Lovely hotel with nice service,"Stayed for four days with my wife and it was lovely. The location is good, very close by O'Connell Street. The room was nice and the breakfast had it all. And the staff where both friendly and professional. Recommended.",4,2018,10,12
228,Great Stay!,"Our stay here was lovely.  The hotel was very nice, the staff was very pleasant, and above all, the bed was absolutely amazing.  This hotel was a nice 10-15 minute walk from Temple Bar/O'Connell Street, so it was nice to be a more quite part of town, but still in total walking distance to the hot spots in Dublin. Would highly recommend.",5,2018,10,09
228,"Location, Location, and",very clean.  excellent service.  blankets are too thick and too warm and the only option unless you separate cover from quilt.  internet is not secure.  traditional irish breakfast was fantastic.  Location is excellent since it's only a few blocks from the main downtown Temple Bar/Trinity College etc.,4,2018,10,08
228,Wonderful Surprise,"What a wonderful, delightful surprise to find the HGI at the Custom House. Excellent location. The Do-Dublin Bus tour stop right outside was an added surprise. Views of the Liffey River right outside - another wonderful surprise. Short walk down to O’Connell St and all major points in the city. Staff and crew were all top notch. When in Dublin again, we’ll pop in for another surprise",5,2018,10,08
228,Lovely hotel on the river,"Cannot fault Hilton Garden Inn. Lovely hotel, great staff, minutes to the city centre. Bar and restaurants excellent and comfortable. River view room, and bathroom very clean and comfortable. Buses and taxis right outside and parking is steps away. Highly recommend.",5,2018,10,08
228,its alright,"i have tried other hotels around the area as i go there fore business. however, i thought the Hilton would be of a better quality not sure it was the case. the hotel is okay it looks and feels a bit old .. to be fair i ll stay at another hotel next time .. but for the price i expected more. the rooms were smaller. the breakfast was not great ... but okay for one night.",4,2018,10,06
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin ,"We stayed for 5 days. They did not have a room with two single rooms but immediately upgraded us to a de luxe room at no extra cost.
We stayed in the newly upgraded section  .
A huge and tasty reakfast is included.
The bus stop is on their doorstep. 
I will definitely recommend this hotel.",4,2018,10,06
228,Everything right where you need it!,"We stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn for 3 nights in April.  The hotel was under construction but the only way you would have know was a few signs.  Nice, newly renovated rooms with good size beds.  The entire staff was friendly and made us feel at home.  Ollie's Bar is my new favorite steak restaurant in Dublin, the pizza, burgers, and blackened salmon are all equally as delicious.",5,2018,10,05
228,Location is great,From check in the front desk was very helpful.  Room is smaller but we had a River view which is worth it overlooking the River Liffey.  It's location is excellent and the Hop on H op Off Red bus is almost right out the door.  Walking distance to Temple Bar and Hapenny bridge and a lot of other sights.  Not a lot of good restaurants near tho.  A convenience store is on the street behind the hotel.  The Famine walk statues are near and the last famine ship is docked right in front.  Beds were comfortable and AC worked fine and noise level was low.  The front desk spoke English well.,4,2018,10,03
228,"Large rooms, quiet riverbank area, close to where the music and fun happens 😀","I enjoyed my stay, because I appreciate a clean, spacious, quiet room and a full breakfast, close to the city center. Absolutely perfect. The staff has been nice and helpful all through my stay at the hotel.",5,2018,10,02
228,Nice stay,"Our tour group enjoyed our stay here. Aside from the clean rooms and comfortable beds, we really enjoyed the made to order omelets and waffles at the breakfast buffet each morning.  The front desk provided us with Dublin maps which proved to be very helpful in navigating our way around the city.  The electric fan in our room was an added convenience which we appreciated having.",5,2018,10,02
228,Nice hotel!,We flew into Dublin and stayed here for 2 nights. It was a very nice hotel and accommodated 4 of us easily. The breakfast was included and was fantastic! Walk to everything was fairly close but takes about 10 minutes to get close to most of the action. I would highly recommend staying here if you are in Dublin.,5,2018,10,02
228,Outrageously poor value for money,"This hotel is clearly not worthy to be part of the Hilton group. I paid 299 Euros per night and they dont even have an operating air conditioning. The rooms are small, more than simple and everything looks run down and shabby. Staff not exactly friendly. 
For this price you get a super room in a 4 or even 5 star hotel, but the Garden Inn Custom House  is certainly not worth that. For what you get there, you'd expect to pay maybe 79€ elsewhere. I will not be back. For sure.",1,2018,10,02
228,Fab hotel,Hotel was lovely and staff friendly and helpful. Ideal for events in the 3arena! Walking distance to Stephens green and most amenities. Would defo recommend this hotel and also the restaurant especially for coeliacs.,5,2018,10,02
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House sure to please.,"We had a great 2 night stay here in August. Easy to navigate from the Irish ferry port to the hotel. Hotel subsidies car parking next to the hotel. Modern bright and airy room. Great breakfast selection hot and cold choices. Laundry room (very clean and modern washers and dryers) was a bonus. Easy walk into the city centre or a block to the closest Luas light rail stop. Restaurants and bars close by, right on the River Liffey.",5,2018,09,27
228,Comfortable room in the heart of the city,"We stayed here overnight.  The hotel is right on the River Liffey.  We chose it for the downtown location so we could be close to shopping for clothes and souvenirs.  Despite the central location, our sleep was completely peaceful. The room was a tad on the cozy side which is to be expected for a hotel in the city center.  The room was completely clean and comfortable and well designed to be easy on the eyes (and not sterile).  In the evening we ate at the in-house restaurant, Oly's.  My fish and chips was fine -- the service was a pleasure due to such friendly staff.",4,2018,09,25
228,Excellent stay in Dublin,"Lovely stay in Dublin. The hotel is located near to the transport links such as the tram. The staff were very helpful at the front desk, with great local knowledge and tips. The buffet style breakfast was very nice and a had a good variety. We would stay again next we are in Dublin",5,2018,09,25
228,Average Dublin Hotel / Good Location / Average Parking,"I stayed at this hotel in September 2018 for 2 days and travel over 150 days annually for both business and vacation (70% domestic US; 30% international).  The hotel is a typical Garden Inn hotel so don't get fooled by comments from other travelers. One gets a standard room for this type of hotel; breakfast; and a decent location to walk around the city. The hotel is not ""excellent"" as some would indicate - it's average, but then the cost is average as well.
The positives: (1) Good location to explore Dublin (about 1/2 mile from good shopping; bars and historical places)  (2) There are restaurants within 500 ft of the hotel (Urban Brewing downstairs is good) 
The negatives: (1)  Parking - the hotel has space in front to drop off bags for 4 cars max at one time and this is normally full. There is NO valet!  The option then is to drive around the corner and use the parking garage. *Note: there is no access to the hotel from the garage thus one has to walk with their bags etc. If it is raining be prepared to get soaked. Things to know: There is a back entrance from the hotel to the parking garage but this is security access only and I'm not sure why  Also, the parking garage closes are night and doesn't open until 6:30 AM; however, the hotel does have the key to allow for after-hours access. (2) Hotel Staff  - Overall friendly but did encounter a couple of staff who didn't seem to appreciate serving guests.  
The hotel did meet my needs for this trip, but I won't be staying at the property again and cannot recommend.",3,2018,09,24
228,Love the breakfast,"Nice hotel with modern amenities.  Good location for walking around and seeing the sights.  Shower good and bed good.  We only stayed here for 1 night upon arrival in Dublin from the USA.  If I could make 1 suggestion, it would be to add a magnified make-up mirror.  My only difficulty was figuring out how to approach the hotel (one way street) and find parking.  There was no valet when I was there and the area where you pull up in front of the hotel is very small.  Their parking garage is around the corner from the hotel, but you can’t access the hotel from the inside so you’ll need to drag your suitcase around the corner.  We were staying there with a Hilton status member and all got free breakfast which was A+!",5,2018,09,23
228,"Great breakfast, Quiet rooms","We booked here with Hilton miles for a quick overnight stay. Rooms are typically small but very nice and super quiet. Small step-in shower that didn’t drain well so you had to shower fast or it flooded the room. 
Breakfast for me and the family was free due to Diamond status, impressive spread with plenty of options, probably saved us about 40€ all together. 
Not quite in city center but close enough for this walking family. ",4,2018,09,23
228,Best hotel ever!,"My partner and I stayed at The Hilton Garden Inn during our visit to Dublin recently as a present for my 40th birthday. Our stay here was lovely. A smart, luxurious hotel with kind and helpful staff on reception. Breakfast is very nice with a selection of traditional or continental types too. Anybody thinking of visiting Dublin I would not recommend anywhere else but this excellent hotel. You will not be disappointed!",5,2018,09,23
228,Great location,"Great accommodations, very clean and very very comfortable. Friendly staff!  Very good breakfast. Amazing location!!! I went to most of the places, like pubs and restaurants, walking.  It was a short stay, but a very pleasant one!",5,2018,09,22
228,Great stay,Hotel convenient to many places especially by the LUAS right behind the hotel. Really great breakfasts. Staff very helpful. They had a laundry on site which was very convenient. EPIC Center and Emmigration museum right next door. Airport bus drops and picks up right in front of hotel. I forget the bus number but it couldn't be easier or cheaper coming from and going to airport.,5,2018,09,21
228,The other end of Dublin riverside ,"I haven’t stayed in the Quayside area in Dublin before but due to attending a conference at Croke Park it seemed more convenient. As a Hilton Honours member I chose this hotel which also had the best price and value deal.
Hotel is spotlessly clean 
Rooms are modern classic and everything you need to work, works.
Bar / restaurant is nice with a lovely Irish Breakfast and the bar serves a well poured pint of Guinness.
Nearby are a number of other restaurants and bars and a walk along the banks of the LIffey is always good.
Recommend this place for this end of town.
",5,2018,09,19
228,Good value - good location,Great location - easy to reach with public transport (green airport bus) from Dublin Airport - HopOn-HopOff bus stops at the hotel - walkable to Temple Bar district - great river-view room - staff friendly - good breakfast - and internet works.  Very small fitness room.  Good HiltonHonors points value as well.,5,2018,09,18
228,Fantastic hotel with great staff in a brilliant location,"I stayed in this hotel over the weekend and had a great time. The location is fantastic and the overall standard is very high. The rooms and public areas were extremely well kept and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. We ate in the restaurant and had drinks in the bar the next night and on both evenings, everyone we dealt with was friendly and bent over backwards to make us feel welcome and get anything we needed.",5,2018,09,17
228,Good location,"Great location on the banks of the river. It is near enough most attractions to be able to walk to them. Nice spacious clean rooms. The hotel looks as if it has recently been refurbished. Good quality breakfast was included . Staff were helpful and very pleasant. 
The airport bus stops right outside the hotel.",5,2018,09,17
228,Great location; comfortable accommodations with wonderful amenities!,"Recently renovated hotel.  Location is excellent; was able to purchase a 7-day Leap Card providing Airlink between airport and hotel, then unlimited travel on Luas (light rail behind hotel), Dublin Bus and Dart (train).  Hotel fresh and accommodating.  Friendly staff, excellent buffet breakfast.  Room a little small but perfect with safe, small fridge and nice bathroom.  ",5,2018,09,16
228,"Good hotel, good location","Good hotel, good location. Airport bus drops off at hotel. Quick walk to public transportation. Reasonable walk to Pubs, restaurants, sites. We selected a room with a view of the river, with the Samuel Beckett bridge (in the shape of an Irish harp) and an old three-master ship. ",5,2018,09,13
228,Basic clean hotel. But felt it was a little over-priced.,"Booked last minute in August so maybe I had to overpay. Clean single room. Not very big, but comfortable. No complaints. About a 10 minute walk east from O'Connell Street. Riverfront location with bus stop right out front for the express bus to and from the airport. Guest laundry room available. ",4,2018,09,13
228,Ireland 2018,Great breakfast and close to city center.  Rooms are fine by EU standard.  Was a good place to unwind after a day of sightseeing.  Parking was a bit of an inconvenience.  The room we had faced the alley and rubbishy bins.  Ok with the cool weather but might get a bit rank in hotter months.  ,3,2018,09,13
228,Great Hotel,"Stayed at the Hilton Dublin recently. From the outside it does not look fancy but the reception area was neat and the staff were always friendly and helpful. Our room was always neat and cosy and everything worked. It was silent as well and overlooked the river. Location was great as it was within working distance to the Luas, the busses and taxis stop right outside the hotel (including tours) and the Tara Street train station is close by as well. Walking distance to the city centre, and the Temple Bar area. Dominic at the front desk was especially helpful. Breakfast was included but could perhaps be improved with more variety. The high price may also put some people off. About half an hour from the airport",4,2018,09,10
228,Dublin stay,We only had two nights in Dublin and the Hilton gave us everything we needed.  My only complaint is our twin bed room was rather tight.  But breakfast was good and the bar and restaurant were great.  All the staff was extremely helpful!!,5,2018,09,09
228,Gorgeous ,"Hotel is modern, comfortable, so so clean with all mod cons. Rooms are fresh & inviting. Beds extremely comfortable. Staff are were very helpful but a lot of trainees which needed more guidance I felt. Breakfast was lovely, all needs catered too. Location just a short walk from Red Luas Line which is very handy. All in all, very impressed & would definitely go back",5,2018,09,09
228,John,I chose this property because I am familiar with the brand and it was not too expensive.  I think it was a little more affordable because it was a decent 15 minute walk to the Temple Bar area which was fine as I am younger and in decent shape.,4,2018,09,05
228,Hiltonish,"We stayed a family of 4 for 3 nights. The hotel is very neat and clean. Check-in and out where very efficient.   The room was big enough for all of us. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is a 10-15 minutes walk to where all the action is - ""Temple Bar"" area. We got a room with the view of the river which was very nice. The Wi-Fi worked good. The airport shuttle bus is just outside the hotel which makes it a good location. Also the hop on Hop off busses run next to it. There is Car Park close to the hotel, but you need to pay for it. Good Value for money. If you book, book it with breakfast!",4,2018,09,03
228,Simplicity is the key 🗝 ,"Perfect hotel for the city break, family gathering or business, everything is on walking distance! 
Room on 5th floor had beautiful river view and huuuge comfortable bed, would move in there tomorrow if I could! :) light in the wardrobe is nice touch, and the little grooming and hygiene kits one call away for people with memory of a goldfish when it comes to packing up the toothpaste, like myself! 

Very very friendly staff, especially breakfast chef who was obviously busy with preparing eggs by order, and yet he was polite, smiling all the time, very relaxing atmosphere overall.. And I have to mention Rich, very accommodating server who happily shared with me that the biggest tip for them is guests satisfaction and wish to come back to the restaurant - that's brilliant state of mind, Rich, but take their money as well! 🙃 :) 

Pictures on the walls together with mirrors in the restaurant is what I like personally, decorations are very simple but effective. 

This is that kind of hotel where you would go if you want to escape from everyday life and treat yourself with peace, silence, King bed and beautiful view, and if you want to have some noise and fun - it's 15 min walk away.

All in all.. Less is more! 😊 ",5,2018,09,03
228,Excellent,"Great location, clean, decent size room for Ireland, and very clean bathroom. Only stayed here for 1 night but was very impressed. Also staff is extremely helpful to tourist visiting the area. I will return to this hotel if I am in the area again. ",5,2018,09,03
228,Good times,"Nice hotel.  Air-conditioning - finally !!!!
Convenient for the airport xpress bus, and the Hop On-Hop Off bus and a couple of museums.  About 7 Euro cab ride to Temple Bar area across the river.

Rooms were good, ours had no view to speak of though.  Breakfast was not cheap, but worth it.  Excellent selection of foods at the buffet.  My only complaint about the breakfast is that I saw 3 coffee stations, but none were decaf coffee. I won't drink instant.  

Stayed for dinner one night (too tired to venture out after touring fabulous Dublin).
The poached pear and blue cheese salad (as a main) had almost no blue cheese.  Had to ask for more cheese ... but the pears were amazing.
The beef cheeks were really tasty, the mash pots were good.  But the sauce was way too salty.

Unfortunately, I was less than impressed with the service.  It was very hard to get anyone's attention.",5,2018,09,03
228,Perfect!,This hotel was a delight.   It is centrally located in Dublin downtown.   After hiking the Wicklow Way ... we so appreciated the self serve laundry.   The reception staff were great... the breakfast is additional but well worth the cost.   This will definitely be our “go to” Dublin hotel.,5,2018,09,02
228,Good hotel,"The hotel is good. The location is also good although not too many things to do. But there are many buses and other places walking distance. Room are quite good, space is enough and clean. Breakfast is nice and you can find almost everything in term of food.",3,2018,09,02
228,Decent hotel for conference centre and not too far from town ,"Stayed here for 2 nights for conference at convention centre. Key features for me were:

Good service on reception and dining/bar area 
Rooms were nice and clean and modern
Room service was very good
Location was great for conference at convention centre and although is a bit of a walk to city centre it’s not too bad (hotel is also on the airport bus route)
Hotel is also close to some nice bars/restaurants round the corner or on other side of river
Breakfast was good; lots of choice and food was well prepared 
Some renovation work was taking place but it didn’t really affect our stay via noise etc",4,2018,09,01
228,Vacation,"We enjoyed our stay, the staff is very friendly. We only ate the breakfast, but the buffet was good and easy to walk to tourist locations from hotel. Parking was easy to get in and out of. Extras like snacks and drinks are on site. ",5,2018,09,01
228,Within walking disance of Connelly station,"A quick one night business stay at this hotel. I like the location as it’s within walking distance of Connelly Station and also is in a great spot for a before breakfast dander and also if you’re attending a concert in the nearby arena. Room is the usual style for this brand and had everything I needed. Lower floors at the front especially those above the front door can be noisy. Plenty of choice for breakfast, not too busy, great omelette station and waffles for those with a sweet tooth. As is normal for Dublin, it cost more than you would ideally like to pay.",4,2018,08,29
228,Perfect location,"What a great location in Dublin. The top destinations are a short walk or tram ride away. The breakfast in the hotel was exceptional. Great selection of fresh baking, eggs, fruit etc. Top notch. The staff were very friendly and checkin was quick and easy. The cruise port is a short distance away and the Airport Express bus stops out front. The bar was a quaint little hotel bar and was reasonably priced.",5,2018,08,27
228,"New hotel, reasonable rates and excellent location","Booked the family suite for a family of four for our younger daughter's graduation celebration.  Couldn't be happier with the suite -- hotel management gave us the corner suite overlooking river Liffey and Tall Ship Jeanie Johnston!  Beds are comfortable, bathroom HUGE and very good quality, fresh and tasty food in the hotel restaurant Ollie's.  Hotel is close (10-15 min walk) to tourist spots, but far enough from the maddening crowds -- an oasis after a hectic day of sightseeing in beautiful Dublin!
Hints:  Airport buses 747 and 757 stop right in front of the hotel.  M&S Simply Food is around the corner for quick snacks, drinks and microwave dinners.",5,2018,08,27
228,Near red line tram and walkable to restaurants ,"While not in the center of tourist activity, it's a 4 min walk to mayor Square or Georges dock red line tram. Also both the 747 and 757 airport express bus drops off and picks up nearby (€7 from airport).  A number of good restaurants nearby including urban brewery, and a good sushi place in mayors Square (mushashi).

Breakfast was very good (could be busy on weekends as they seem to get some tour bus business).

USB charging bedside. Super. And maybe all hotels do this now but drapes had off setting rails to avoid gap in drapes. Excellent. The tub is super tall and narrow (so if you are mobility challenged beware). But they have some of the best towels I've seen at a hotel in years. And I stay at a lot of hotels.

All in all a great hotel choice that I'd gladly come back to. ",5,2018,08,26
228,Great room ,"After a shaky start with a multitude of admin issues, this turned into a great place. In the interest of disclosure, I am a Hilton Honors member so use them in many places.

Was eventually moved to a King room overlooking the Liffey - lovely room . Thanks 

Whilst it may not be in the centre of town , the transport nearby is fabulous. Tram stop 3 minutes walk away and bus stop to airport is right outside! 

Any problems and they eventually work it out which is why I love Hilton,

The breakfast is outstanding,

Would I go back ?  Absolutely ",4,2018,08,26
228,Hilton garden inn,"The hotel is easy to get to, though don't drive to it during rush hour. The parking garage behind the hotel is a great asset for longer term discounted parking. The hotel will validate your ticket for a discount (we paid €49 for 3 days, which is great). Easy walking to bus and tram stops, plus great restaurants with outdoor dining.",5,2018,08,25
228,Nice Location,"Stayed here one night during a trip to the UK and Ireland. The location is good, not great. A bit of a walk to the main areas, but not so far it is difficult. The price was decent for that part of the city. Otherwise, your standard Hilton.",4,2018,08,23
228,"Close to financial district, far from most tourist attractions","The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House is a nice hotel, with modern furniture, adequate WiFi, and a pleasant breakfast.  It is next store to the new EPIC museum but is otherwise about 1 kilometer or more from the main tourist activities",4,2018,08,23
228,Excellent hotel with great services,"This hotel was exactly what I expected from staying at a Hilton hotel. From the start to finish, everything was perfect. The receptionist was professional and efficient. She made checking-in a pleasant experience. The lobby was nice and comfortable. 

The room was spotlessly clean and quiet and had a really comfortable bed (not all Hilton hotels have comfortable beds these days). The air-conditioning worked well and was quiet. Bathroom was also good.

The breakfast was one of the best Hilton breakfasts we've had recently. The whole setting was cosy and comfortable. Everything tasted nice and fresh. 

The location was good. Right in the middle of the new trendy areas in Dublin. It was clean and safe. Plenty of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Local buses to touristy places in Dublin stopped just outside the hotel but we could easily walk to everywhere. Taxi to the airport took only 20 minutes and costs 20 euros. 

This was the best hotel we stayed in Dublin. Next time we are in Dublin, we will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,08,22
228,Marvelous location and a nice property,I stayed here for two nights as part of a business trip.    These were my best evenings in Dublin.  Nicely maintained property.  Very quiet even though the area was bustling.  Very tasty breakfast with lots of choices.   Close to transit & shops & restaurants & such.   This will be my go to property when I return to Dublin,5,2018,08,21
228,Great stay,"Two bed queen room large for Europe standards. Very clean and well appointed.  Loved the layout. The beds were across room from each other rather than next to each other. Gave more privacy. 

Located along water front easy distance to Croke Park and train station.

Loved the room and would stay here again, however even though breakfast was included, I would probably pass on hot breakfast. Even cold breakfast the milk was warm. Seems the staff can’t keep up with demand and things are undercooked, not there or warm (milk)",5,2018,08,20
228,Enjoyable stay and excellent service,We stayed here for three nights.  The staff are very friendly and nothing is any trouble.   Our room was lovely it overlooked the Liffey.  There is a good sized bathroom with bath and shower.  A fridge and safe is also provided in the room.  Car parking is round the corner in a multi-storey and you pay at a reduced rate.  The breakfast was delicious and great choice from hot to cold.  You can also get waffles etc made fresh to order.  There is something for everyone.  We also ate in the restaurant and there is a good variety.  Once again the staff were superb.  It is within walking distance to the city centre.  It is also a 15 minute taxi drive to RDS.  Very enjoyable stay would love to go back.,4,2018,08,15
228,Good but overpriced,"Nice hotel, staff were nice too but very overpriced! We ordered room service too but it wasn’t great, the pizza I ordered wasn’t cooked thoroughly. It’s an ok place to stay as it’s central to all close places ",4,2018,08,14
228,Beautiful room with a fabulous view,"My family and I stayed for 3 nights in this hotel, and from the receptionist at the desk, to the ladies who clean the rooms, we have nothing but good things to say.
They are all very friendly and accommodating staff. 

We got upgraded to a beautiful corner room, which was perfect for the 4 of us. A very comfortable room, and a beautiful bathroom, with a bath and separate shower. 

We didnt see any building works inside, just a bit of scaffolding to one side of the building, which did not make any difference to the building itself. 

Breakfast was lovely, especially the waffles, and staff here were also very pleasant and accommodating. 

Would definitely book here again, such a lovely weekend had by all.

The location on the Customs House Quay is very convenient to the Luas line, and the conference centre.
You can be in Dublin City Centre in 15 minutes for shopping or sight seeing.",5,2018,08,13
228,Bed was like a brick. ,"The hotel was very nice and on the river. No easy access to parking deck due to construction. Lobby and rooms were nice. Staff very kind. The beds, however, were hard as rock. Like laying on bricks. I’ve never experienced a bed so hard in all my travels. Be aware. ",2,2018,08,12
228,"Great stay, comfortable and clean hotel!","Great stay at this Hilton Garden Inn located on the quays, only a few minutes' walk from the city centre, and conveniently connected to the airport by the 757 bus.  My room on the third floor facing the rear of the hotel was comfortable, well-sized, and very clean.  Water power in the shower was great, also a good refreshment tray and decent iron (things I always appreciate in a hotel!).  Staff were friendly and efficient, given the size and number of guests staying.  Breakfast was also good - great selection - but tables from previous guests could have been cleared more quickly.  Enjoyable stay!",4,2018,08,12
228,Lovely hotel in a great location.,"This Hilton is well located to visit central Dublin with Trinity College within walking distance, and an airport bus stop right outside. We had views over the river, in a recently refurbished room with a lovely bathroom too. We were able to leave bags on arrival and on departure so we could explore without suitcases. There’s also a Costa coffee in the lobby. We didn’t eat there as felt it was a bit expensive and preferred to find local cafes and restaurants. The stay itself was quite expensive but booked through Expedia with flights too made it very straightforward.",4,2018,08,12
228,This hotel is not for HH Diamonds members,"After a business visit to Dublin, I was a bit surprised about the lack of recognition of HH Diamond members at this hotel.

Pro
The room was new like the rest of the hotel.
Double windows in room. Remember to close them else the noise from the road is loud, especially around 6am.
The room service food was fine.

Con
No room upgrades or other advantages, except for a bottle of water at checkin.
It can be difficult to get a taxi in the morning as the reception is busy and sometimes less taxis are around. I learned to use the mytaxi app, that is probably best option.
The internet was often difficult to get on. It's free, so anyone can access.
The hotel was filled with people, so breakfast at 8am is a bit stressful. Probably it will be better out of the holiday season.",3,2018,08,12
228,Lovely food but a long wait ..................,"Went here for post theatre meal and to avoid the rush hour traffic . There seemed to be several different dining areas but we were shown into the small dining area to the left of the long bar . There were about 5 tables here . We were a party of 7 and we just wanted some good food , not a huge meal . Most main courses started off at 14.95 with vegetables and salads extra. There was a 2 course option for 21..95 .
The waiter was very nice and gave us plenty of time to check the menu . He brought a jug of iced water to the table and refilled this several times during our time there which was just as well as we waited 55 minutes for our food . There was nothing complicated in the order , just regular burgers , one fish dish and some lamb with couscous. The people at the neighbouring table were having starters as we arrived and there seemed to be a long wait for their mains as well . Now the food ( when it finally arrived ) was very tasty , the hand cut chips were thick and crunchy , the burger bun was a nice sweet one , and the coleslaw was creamy . My friends lamb dish seemed on the small side but she said that it was tasty . 
Our waiter seemed to be serving all the tables in our small area and I think he could have done with some help . Yes he was very efficient and pleasant but it was a long time to wait . I noticed a large group of  diners in the foyer as well and I was hoping that our  waiter wasn't looking after them as well . In short , the food was tasty but the service was really slow . Perhaps an extra chef is needed . It is a great location for theatre goers but we were glad that we weren't rushing to a show afterwards because we definitely would have been late !",3,2018,08,11
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House,This is an excellent property to visit Dublin in the central city area.  The staff is great at supporting your visit and the hotel property is nice.  I would recommend it to others who would like to walk to many attractions in Dublin.,5,2018,08,11
228,"Nice Hotel, convenient location.","We stayed here after a long haul flight with connections.  We were tired!  Access from the airport was easy with the express bus stopping at the door.  We were able to get a good night’s sleep in our quiet, air conditioned room and be ready to go in the morning.

Pluses: Friendly staff, clean rooms, red line is close or easy walk to most sights.

Minuses:  many frontline employees were all trainees, any meal besides breakfast at the restaurant.

I would stay here again.",4,2018,08,08
228,Fantastic place to Stay In Dublin,"This Hilton is located in the financial district of Dublin, its new, fresh, in a great location and close to everything. This hotel has a great staff, fantastic rooms, and a wonderful restaurant for breakfast. This is the place to stay for shows at the 3A arena, just a short walk down the street. Parking is close by and affordable. Location is close to all the site you want to see while in Dublin all within walking distance. Just a great place. Sure expensive a bit but worth it.",5,2018,08,08
228,"Great location, nice hotel","We travel quite a lot and this hotel did not disappoint us.  It’s a bit pricy but has a great proximity location to many city highlights while being outside of the tourist zone.  It’s located next to the Irish Emigration Museum which is worth a visit. 

Breakfast is nice and reasonably priced.  
",5,2018,08,07
228,"Lovely Hotel, disappointing restaurant","My husband and I stayed here for one night on August 2nd. The hotel itself was lovely, nice reception and the room was comfortable and more importantly very clean. Unfortunately our nice stay was overshadowed by a disappointing visit to the hotel's restaurant - Oly Restaurant - we had booked here as we weren't in the mood for venturing out and about. We really regret this decision. We were at the restaurant at 9pm exactly and it took about 10mins for someone to take our order. Our main course came at 9.30pm and I must admit the food was lovely. We were probably finished eating our main course at about 9.45pm and we were looking forward to our dessert. A male staff member came and took our plates and we thought he was going to bring us the dessert menu. When he didn't come back to us we stopped a female staff member and asked her for the menu. This was about 10pm. She went off for about 5mins and when she came back she informed us that the kitchen closed at 10pm and the chef was gone home. We were disappointed as we felt they had had plenty of time to take our order and in any event they should have informed us the kitchen was closing. What made matters totally worse was that plates of hot food, burgers and chips, continued to be brought to other tables up to 20mins past 10pm so there must have been staff still in the kitchen. Also one would presume that desserts are already plated up and stored in refrigerators so whoever was preparing the hot food could have prepared our desserts. We also felt the female staff member was not a bit nice when we showed our disappointment. My husband wanted to call a manager but I didn't want to spoil our night so we took the remainder of our wine and sat in the hotel reception. When my husband went to the bar later on he got talking to a very friendly barman and they discussed the earlier situation. The barman kindly gave us a round of drinks on the house. He also arranged for the night manager to come over to us to apologise on behalf of the hotel. When we were just about to go to bed the barman brought another free round of drinks and a bottle of prosecco over to us. We thought this was very generous and we appreciated the gesture very much. However it did not make up for the failing's of the restaurant. When I see a restaurant's closing time I would always presume the closing time was to stop new customers from entering the restaurant NOT to stop serving the existing customers who have already eaten one or more courses. All in all I would recommend staying in the hotel but I would definitely recommend dining elsewhere.",3,2018,08,07
228,Bad value,"Hard to criticise this hotel except to say that for €180 for 1 double room without breakfast I would expect more.

It’s very expensive for what you get, welcome to rip off Dublin City and this hotel epitomises that sentiment.

The rooms are very compact, large bed is very comfy, toilet is compact. Everything is there, tea/coffee, iron, hair dryer, big TV, spotless clean.

Nevertheless, it’s claustrophobic, the minute we settled in, we wanted to leave it.

Same can be said for the rest of the hotel, restaurant and bar is not cheap. Service is efficient and insincere.

But I suppose we are in Dublin City so best option once you arrive here is to check in and leave and enjoy all beautiful Dublin has to offer.

We won’t be returning, this hotel is only good for sleeping in and at €180 for the pleasure, it ain’t worth it.

Shop around...., much better out there.",3,2018,08,06
228,Great Hotel,Uniformly great hotel with a self laundry which we used. Good location to Conventiom Centre. Right outside is hop on hop off bus stop or airport bus. Includes small room refrigerator which I found useful. Nice lunch which I used once. ,5,2018,08,06
228,Excellent Value,"My wife and I were in Dublin for 8 days on vacation. The hotel was perfectly situated. It is a convenient walk to Trinity College, Temple Bar area, Dublin Castle as well as Christ Church. If you use Paddy Wagon Tours as we did then you are only a five minute walk from their pick up point.

Checking in I had made an error in picking my room choice. After seeing the room the folks at the front desk, Samantha and the gentleman in charge (sorry for not getting his name) were most accommodating in finding us another room at the original rate with a river view. Kudos to them.  The rooms were nice, beds comfortable and the bathroom fine. We ate several meals in the restaurant and except for one occasion the service was good and the food ok.

Overall based on location, service and costs this hotel was perfect for us.",5,2018,08,05
228,Great stay,"Very pleasant 4 night stay - staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Quick cab ride to Temple Bar, walking distance for most, and close to O’Connell. Airport bus stop right there. Breakfast buffet was awesome.",4,2018,08,05
228,River-view location,"Stayed here w my daughter for a night out meeting up w family in Centre City.  We were okay for the walk to say, Stephen's Green, abt a mile away. The beds were super comfy, and the towels were home-sized!  Loved the view from our room, out onto the river.",5,2018,08,05
228,Great hotel for family vacation to Dublin,Great location.  Easy access by car but short walk to everything.  Parking garage next door was very easy too.  Large rooms - the two queen room was as big as any hotel room in the US.  Also very quite.  Bar was nice as well.,5,2018,08,04
228,Great location and above average hotel,"This hotel is in a great location being next to the river and less than a 1/2 mile from trinity college.  We walked easily to the temple bar area, Christ’s church and Dublin castle without problem.  It is also next to the Irish Emigration museum and the bus stops for the green, red and yellow hop off hop on buses.  The main pros:
Clean and modern hotel
Air conditioned 
Nice buffet breakfast
Near restaurants
Near O’Oconnell street (about 1/2 mile)
It has a small workout room
Great location
Friendly staff

Cons:
No major issues 
Restaurant is nice but limited menu
Somewhat expensive but cheaper than most 
Bed could use a pillow top since it was somewhat hard",4,2018,08,01
228,Lovely staff,We called in for lunch - and from the second we walked into Olly's bar until we left the staff were excellent.The staff were pleasant and friendly. The food came fast and it was delicious. A main course for €10 Inc chips or soup - it's very inexpensive. A lovely foyer and a carpark a very short walk away. ,4,2018,08,01
228,Great Staff,"Really enjoyed my stay - good location, room with a nice view of the river. Staff all very accommodating and friendly. There was a great selection for breakfast also. Would definitely recommend to others.",4,2018,08,01
228,Good Location,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our trip to Ireland. Located on the river, near the Custom House in Dublin ; location was great for walking to the EPIC Irish museum, and a lot of other Dublin attractions. Rooms were clean, and the staff were very helpful.",4,2018,07,31
228,Wonderful Stay,"We spent two nights at this hotel.  The rooms were clean and well-appointed and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Custom House is a short walk to various points of interest, not least the Temple Bar district.  Highly recommended!",5,2018,07,31
228,Great Location,"Hilton Garden Inn is a great location for seeing the sights of Dublin.  A block away is the new Epic Immigration Museum.  Definitely worth a visit.  Just down the street is The Custom House.  Across the river is Trinity College.   Good staff, clean, well kept rooms, good breakfast.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2018,07,28
228,Good quality and clean,"We stayed here for 2 nights in July and would highly recommend this hotel. The queen room was a good size with a decent bed and mattress and both the room and bathroom were very clean.

There was some building work going on outside our 1st floor room while we were there, we were out for most of the day so it did not impact our sleep but did start quite early in the morning (builders arrived around 8am to start) It wasn't anything too major and looks like it will be finished soon.

Breakfast was excellent and was well stocked despite the hotel being very busy, staff were attentive and constantly refreshing items.

This is a great hotel which benefits from a location within walking distance to many attractions and the bus/train station, we would definitely stay here again",5,2018,07,27
228,Vacation ,We had a room with two queen beds! The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was large and very nice.  We ate at Olys the wings were great!  Good pizza and good drinks.  Breakfast was the best with an omelette station. It was very easy to walk to the sites,5,2018,07,27
228,"Stunning views, modern, beautiful room.","We had a fantastic room location on a corner with views overlooking the River Liffey, and the Samuel Beckett Bridge. The room, and the hotel, has obviously been recently (tastefully) remodelled and it's modern, stylish and functional with USB chargers and mini lights on the bed. Our room had a separate living room, with a couch and flat screen. It was quiet (new windows) the blinds provided black-out room darkening, so it was really a tremendous place to get some quality zzzzs. The breakfast buffet is really excellent and fresh, and amenities like the laundry were very helpful. Location is great, near a train station and pretty easy walking distance to Grafton street and many other attractions. In fact it's right next door to EPIC, the Irish immigration museum, as well as the Customs House. Great hotel!",5,2018,07,26
228,Great Stay,"Super clean room, very quite. Staff friendly for the most part (not over the top but good enough). Hotels in a great location within steps of the Jeanie Johnstone (sp?) tall ship, Famine memorial, EPIC emigration museum, and 5-10 minute walk away from Connolly St. 15 minute walk from Temple Bar.
Would gladly stay again.  ",5,2018,07,24
228,Grand hotel in the Docklands area,Great location in the Docklands area next to the new Epic Emigration museum and nearby restaurants.  Very good restaurant and bar in the hotel and excellent full breakfast is served with traditional Irish offerings and omelette and waffle station.  ,5,2018,07,24
228,Great location!,"Upon arriving, although the desk associate was not up to Hilton standards, the room was perfect.
Breakfast was amazing and never felt rushed to hurry up and eat. Lots of choices, whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or not, although take away fresh fruit went quickly.
Some construction at the entrance made it a bit noisy but even when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were directly next door at EPIC, there was no problem entering and exiting.",5,2018,07,24
228,Concert stay over,"Great nights stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.  Room was very clean and very comfortable with everything we needed for our one night stay including very much needed Air Con!  Ideal location only a short walk to O'Connell Street and a tram stop just around the corner giving easy access all over the city.  Room rate was a bit on the pricey side but about what you would expect for Dublin and we did book at the last minute.  Reception, bar and house-keeping staff all very pleasant and friendly.  We also availed of the conveniently located car park with discounted overnight rate for hotel guests.",5,2018,07,23
228,One night stay ,"We stayed in this hotel for one night after coming from Galway and flying out of Dublin the next day.  I will preface by saying I have Hilton status so I like to stay in them when I can.  It was worth it because it was a good location - mile or so walk to temple bar area and other points of interest.  Since it’s on the river, the walk is nice up either side with restaurants and shops.  We enjoyed the free breakfast buffet for gold status — much more than a garden inn in the US.  It’s more like a buffet you’d get at a full service Marriott or Hilton for $30.  I wish there was free parking or even pay valet — the garage was behind and it was $20 for one night but it wouldn’t keep us from staying again.  I recommend!  ",5,2018,07,22
228,Convenient location,"When I go to a foreign country, normally i like to stay at a traditional hotel for the area, but for the first night of a two week vacation,I wanted comfort and location. We got both here. The staff welcomed us and allowed us to get in our room immediately we could take a power nap. The beds are so comfortable! We have a nice tub and shower, refrigerator, and safe in our room. They have breakfast in the lobby area, so that was a bonus as a diamond member. I woukd come back again.",5,2018,07,21
228,Beautiful Place,"Staying at the Hilton was our last night in Ireland. We returned to Dublin the night before our flight. We traveled throughout the entire country and found this to be just what we needed the night before our long travels home. It was clean, a good location and had a great breakfast. Definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone",5,2018,07,21
228,Hilton Garden Inn Custom House Dublin,"It was a very convenient and comfortable place to stay, we enjoyed it. A little bit pricey, would have been great if breakfast would have been included. The laundry room was a great benefit and very convenient. ",5,2018,07,21
228,Hotel had a few issues but Oly’s bartenders awesome ,"Stuart and his crew were very welcoming and gave great service at the end of the day! Excellent.

The rooms on the other hand had some issues. First one was Crazy Hot! And the fan was broken. Moved to another one and there was water dripping in two places I believe the AC so wet spots on the carpet my entire 10 day stay.

Upon check out found someone had been allowed to charge several hundred euros of charges on my room. Told them at the desk I never authorized any of that. They did get them removed by the time I arrived back in the states but quite surprised to have something like that happen.

Location is good, again restaurant and bar very good.",3,2018,07,21
228,"Nice staff, building noise is incredible","Staff are friendly and the food is nice, when it's available. Was there for three nights. One night they practically ran out of food. No hot food available at 9.30, not even pizza. The noise in the room during the day is absolutely ridiculous. Not only can you not make a phone call, the noise was genuinely unbearable. If I was paying for this myself, I would have asked for a refund.",2,2018,07,21
228,Comfortable stay!,"After our Ireland tour we came to Dublin to explore this beautiful city and stayed at Hilton during our stay!
They have very comfortable rooms with huge beds! Food wise also it’s very good we had our dinner here and it was fabulous!
Be it the burger, risotto or the chicken pasta everything was perfect to the core!
One good thing about this place is it’s very near city centre so you walk around the area and yes catch up the yellow bus for great sighting via hop on and hop off",5,2018,07,21
228,Hilton failed to impress,We visited this property July 9th and 10th in 2018.  Location is good but overall the impression was poor.  There was construction on the front door so you could not off load in front.  Parking is around the corner and they did not make plans to accommodate guests with luggage.  Front desk was efficient but not very warm and greeting.  I have attained Diamond status for over 20 years until I retired.  I am presently Gold and frankly I did not get any feeling that it mattered.  The bartender was extremely pleasant and accommodating.  I will not go back to this location.,2,2018,07,20
228,Fabulous stay,We had 2 rooms for the 5 of us. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. Staff were very kind. Would stay again if we get the chance. Breakfast was fabulous!!! And with being Hilton gold status. Ours was free each morning and that was a very nice bonus. ,5,2018,07,20
228,"Great Location, Good Restaurant and Bar",I stayed at this hotel because of the close proximity to the convention center - it's only a short 5 minute walk. Lots of coffee and food shops nearby. Very close to Temple Bar and other shopping areas too. I was told the hotel recently finished some renovations - A/C in all the rooms now - it worked great in my room. The room was clean and comfortable and staff was very helpful in answering any questions or printing my outbound airline boarding passes. The only slightly negative comments could be that the bed was a little stiff and the shower could be a little hotter - minor issues overall. Would stay here again.,5,2018,07,19
228,Good location,This spot was right next to the EPIC museum and a five minute walk to bars and downtown. The room was fine.The wi-fi was a bit spotty which can be an issue when traveling. Having a mini fridge was a nice feature. Staff was very accommodating. ,4,2018,07,17
228,"Good hotel, nice breakfast, good location","Rooms are fine, location great for meetings in IFSC but also easy to get in to town centre for the evening. Breakfast generally good, but omellete station is top notch. Gym is basic, but does the job.",4,2018,07,16
228,Dublin,"Very nice hotel, in front of river, right on the quay, everything seems new at this hotel.  
Nice view of the mountains and river, our room is quite large, No 434. Although our first room was smaller, we asked if we could be moved next to our sons room, and they were very pleased to do so.
Sorry for the quality of the photos, but taken though the windows, this is the scenery from our room.",5,2018,07,16
228,Very impressive duty manager (Declan ),"Booked two rooms for family weekend in Dublin (July 13 th and 14 th ).The manager on duty for the weekend (Declan ) could not have been more helpful and accommodating to my husband when we were booking into the hotel as there was a small issue to be clarified with regard to our booking and Declan made every attempt to sort it out for us .Our rooms next door to each other on the 7 th floor were very stylish and comfortable with excellent views of Dublin .The staff in the restaurant and bar were very friendly and chatty .The breakfast was of a very high standard .The overall atmosphere in the hotel was very welcoming .The hotel is very well located ,I would recommend it .",5,2018,07,15
228,So-So,Stayed here twice on my visit to Dublin as part of a group tour.  Construction going on which I wasn't affected by but others in my group were.  There was a mix up as far as them having no record of my personal reservation but at this point not sure where the blame lies.  Hotel itself is nothing fancy.. Nothing special but nothing disgusting.  Continental breakfast and dinner wasn't bad... Location again is so-so. Not in the center of things but not far if you need a taxi.  Highlight was Prince Harry and Megan visited nearby during our stay so I got to experience that event quite by accident.,3,2018,07,15
228,Great stay in Dublin,"First of all, the staff is wonderful. Very helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable and well-maintained with a lovely view of the river. The location was on the north side of the Liffey, thus a bit quieter, but within a 10 minute walk of Grafton St. Buses and hop-ons available out front. For a hotel, the breakfasts are excellent. Extensive choices for either continental or full buffet.",5,2018,07,14
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin,"The stay at the HGI in Dublin, Ireland was fantastic. The rooms were very nice and clean, the breakfast was delicious and there were many options for vegetarians. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Close walking distance to many Dublin activities, the train, and river. ",5,2018,07,14
228,My 1st Review Ever,"Just to preface. I have been a Diamond HH member for close to 20 years. I dont say that to brag, but to let you know that I travel often and this is not my first time in a hotel. I have saved points for several years to take my family on this vacation. So imagine my surprise that they hotel would only cover part of my stay with points and the rest I had to pay in cash. I spent time ever day dealing with this, only to be told in the end that there is mithing anythimg can do. How is that possible? Multi billon dollar company cant figure out how to get something like this done. The hotel says it is HH fault and HH says it is the hotels fault. All I know is I am out the cash. 
PS bartender was awesome! ",1,2018,07,14
228,Thank heaven for AC,The hotel was close to downtown without the noise. Great views of the river Liffey. Staff was courteous and available. Rooms were clean and comfortable. I’d stay here again. Easy to remember the location with bridge names over the river and Jeanie Johnston tallship. Getting a taxi was easy.,4,2018,07,11
228,Don't forget anything in your room!!! They DON'T return it back!!!,"I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin for one week, had a really huge suitcase so after so many days I left one pair of brand new shoes under the bed.
My mistake, I know, but when you're in a hurry, things happen!
I called them 7 times about it and of course, never found anything....
Well, they were brand new, it explains a lot...
Really disappointing service so, never again in Hilton!!",3,2018,07,11
228,Great Location in Dublin,"We were upgraded to a fantastic room because of some work still going on at the hotel while we were there.
This hotel is brilliant for location and is a 20 minutes bus ride from the airport and the bus stops almost outside the hotel!   Staff really helpful and friendly and I will be going back.",5,2018,07,11
228,Great quailty Hilton in centre of Dublin,"Great hotel in the centre of Dublin ,very good location very near to all the shops and restaurants.
Rooms a good size and good quality ,had rooms overlooking the liffey   but with secondary glazing it was nice and quiet .
The hotels own restaraunt  food was a good quality ,with good service",5,2018,07,10
228,Great hotel in a great location.,"Great location overlooking the river. From here we were able easily walk to Trinity College, George’s Street Arcade, St. Patrick’s Cathedral and great restaurants. There is a very nice walking path along the river. Our room was newly remodeled, very comfortable, plenty of room for two people and had lots of plugs and USB ports. During our stay they were still completing the building facade, but it did not disrupt our stay or view. Everyone was very courteous, and breakfast was wonderful with plenty of options. No parking on site, but there is a public parking structure right around the corner and the hotel offers a discount. I’m a loyal Hilton Honors member, and this hotel did not disappoint. ",5,2018,07,08
228,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed one night here and was very happy with my stay. It's a great hotel, good food with clean and well finished and maintained rooms. I can really recommend this hotel if you wish to have a comfortable stay in the city.",4,2018,07,08
228,Lovely hotel on the river and wonderful location.,"Stayed here for three nights prior to a cruise. This is a great location, very close to so many attractions.  We were able to walk everywhere , O'Connell street for shopping and to visit the post office and museum commemorating the 1916 uprising, temple bar area, the immigration museum is right next door, and there is a stop for the hop on hop off tour bus right outside the hotel also. The hotel is undergoing renovations and updates, we were assigned. A room without air conditioning, which would have been fine since it was still cool outside, however having to open windows made it all too noisy so we did change rooms after one night and that was not a problem. The bar/restaurant in the hotel was also nice. We had been out all day, arriving back at the hotel about 9:30 and decided to have a quick bite since we had not had dinner. The service was efficient and the burgers delicious. Onsite laundry room is available for guests also. This was a lovely place and would definitely stay here again ",4,2018,07,08
228,Concert city centre Dublin stay,"My wife and I had the wonderful weekend stay in the heart of the capital city this weekend. What a truly great location, fantastic service and a clean, comfortable and relaxing room. An amazing liffey view from the 7th floor. Our Michael Buble concert in Croke Park was an easy walk away, so it is a perfect location to stay for matches and concerts. Right beside business IFSC quarter with lots of footfall and all customers on the restaurants and bar were relaxed and happy. 
Food was brilliant. We had pulled pork sandwiches when we arrived at lunch, a midnight pizza after the concert and the buffet style breakfast was absolutely unbeatable. Service at breakfast was handled so wonderfully, particular mention for the lady who met us to seat us with smile and great attitude. We watched her greet everyone with the same happy and friendly manner. Great stay!",5,2018,07,08
228,Great hotel!,"We stayed here for six nights at the end of June. Accommodations were clean and comfortable.  We had air conditioning, comfortable beds and black out curtains which made sleeping ideal. Staff was always friendly and helpful.  Check in was easy- arrived early and one of our three rooms was ready for us at 11am after a long trip during the night from the U.S. The location was perfect! We didn’t rent a car. We walked, took the dart or the tram which are both around the corner. There is a mini mall next door in Epic where you can get a quick bite to eat. Being gold members, we did get breakfast which was very good - fresh and filling!  It’s right next to River Liffey and we all had pretty views from our rooms.  I highly recommend this hotel in Dublin and I would stay here again.
",5,2018,07,07
228,"Family room was great, nice, clean hotel","Family room was more than adequate for our family.  Stayed one night using points, and we received a very nice room with a view of the river.  Easy walking distance to O’Connell Street for shopping and Temple Bar.  The Immigration museum is right next door to the hotel.  Sorry we didn’t have time to visit.  Perfect spot and a bit less pricey than other Hilton properties that are closer to Temple Bar, if you don’t mind walking 10-15 minutes.  Would stay here again with the family. Also, hotel has coin operated laundry if you need it! ",4,2018,07,06
228,Not for coffee takeaway,"I work nearby and today I stopped for a coffee. I asked for a small size cup (which I got), but they made me pay for the medium size. It's not a big deal but what I found annoying is the wait.. I had a note of 50 euro only and they didn't have the change, so they had to go and break the note at reception. The guy came back nearly after 10 minutes of wait and I arrived late in work.
I went almost everyday in the Hilton in Charlemont for 10 years as I was working beside and they were very well organised and fast. Maybe the staff in the Hilton Garden needs more training and support as the morning is a busy time.",2,2018,07,05
228,Convenient & Riverside,"My vivacious young bride and I enjoyed a two-night weekend here.
The location is very convenient to the Luas Line (tram), Connolly Railway Station and Busaras (the main Bus Depot). It is on the Airport Shuttle bus route as well as the Hop-on Hop-off tourist bus routes. It is walking distance to the 3 Arena, O'Connell St., and Grafton St.
It is located on the river near the International Financial Services Centre, Customs House and the Conference Centre.
Discounted parking is available in a multi-story just 10s of metres behind the hotel.
Our room was comfortable with a large shower. All well appointed. We had a river view which was a bonus.
All the staff were friendly and helpful. The bar was pleasant (not always the case in hotels). We didn;t have breakfast so I cannot comment on thta but we did have dinner one of the nights and it was excellent.
The hotel provides good quality free WiFi throughout.
I thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,07,05
228,First time to Dublin,"Fantastic hotel in an ideal location, rooms were spacious, clean & we had a riverside view. Breakfast was lovely,there was a large selection available & constantly re stocked if needed. All Staff were pleasant & helpful throughout our stay. Would highly recommend this hotel & would happily stay again. Dublin was a beautiful city too! X",5,2018,07,04
228,City Break base,"Great base for a city break in Dublin. Bus stops immediately outside make it easy (and cheap) to get to and from the airport. Service at reception was efficient and polite and room was clean and good size.
We didn't use pblic transport while we were there as we found Temple Bar and City Centre to be within managable walking distance from the hotel.",4,2018,07,04
228,nice location with easy access to City Center,"easy walking distance to City Center (10-15 minutes).  plenty of dining options within a 5-10 minute walk as well.  family room had more than enough space for us, and the front desk was very helpful while we waited for our luggage to arrive.  breakfast buffet had plenty of choices and was well run (even with several large groups present).  coin operated laundry facility onsite as well.",5,2018,07,03
228,Perfect Location,"Located in a great location downtown Ireland, we visited here for 3 nights in June. The hotel has wonderful service, along with a great breakfast buffet. The staff was extremely polite and the room design very pleasant. The front desk staff assisted us each morning with directions on how to get to our attractions, as well as, what bus to take to those outlying areas we wanted to visit (the Botanical Gardens). 

Because of the location we were able to walk to almost all of the attractions we had mapped out. Every night we walked along the river--so romantic. 

The only negative was that upon check-in we were not recognized as Diamond members and not offered complimentary breakfast the next morning. I didn't question this when we checked in because we had been flying all day and were exhausted. When I mentioned this the next day, they apologized but were unable to remove the charge for breakfast the first morning. Not sure why but we didn't complain since we were on vacation.",4,2018,07,03
228,Excellent hotel close to central Dublin,"Magnificent hotel in the financial area and close the river Liffey and the central Dublin. 
Nice and spacious rooms, a magnificent and lively lounge/reception/restaurant area. 
Easy check-in/check-out facility. ",5,2018,07,03
228,Great stay,"Super nice hotel and staff.  Convenient location.  Was able to walk most everywhere we wanted to go. Sightseeing, eating, shopping were all nearby. Staff was very helpful and eager to help.  Water, soda, snacks all available on site. ",5,2018,07,02
228,Good location ,"This is a nice hotel with the good amenities you would expect from a Hilton - such as its breakfast (€13 If booked at reception or €14 at the reception - kids are free).  The airport bus and hop on/ hop off bus tours stop right at the door.

I shared a room with my 7&9 year old kids and it was a bit of a squeeze - basically a twin room and the beds were a tad too firm, but perhaps I’m being picky because I expect a bit more from Hilton.  Overall, the hotel was an excellent base for a long weekend visiting Dublin,  the staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were nice and clean.",4,2018,07,01
228,Great place to stay in Dublin,"This hotel was a great place to stay in Dublin. The hotel facilities are beautiful and clean, the service is great, and the location at Custom House Quay is perfect. The express bus to the airport stops out front, it is a quick and easy walk to Dublin Connolly train station, it’s across from the river and next to the CHQ building. The CHQ building is a redone historical building filled with breakfast/lunch restaurants, a couple of dinner/bars and one of the best
museums-EPIC-The Irish Emmigration Museum. Don’t miss that. Otherwuse, the hotel is a 20 minute walk to many other tourist attractions, such as Trinity College and O’Connell Street.",5,2018,07,01
228,Perfect for our stay,"Area is quiet and Nice close to the river. 
People working here is so polite and Nice. Room was very Ok. Good view to the river. Everything you need in the room, and it was very clean. I Really recomend this hotel. We enjoyed our stay here very much. 
Thank you!",5,2018,06,30
228,Great position,"I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend , the hotel was great for visiting the city of Dublin it’s position next to the river Liffey made it easy to find at the end of a busy day sight seeing . The Costa coffee house was perfectly placed in the foyer . The hotel staff were extremely helpful allowing us to have our room early so we could freshen up after our flight",5,2018,06,30
228,Very pleasant and lovely hotel,"Newly renovated rooms are pristine clean. We were concerned about notice re construction but construction well hidden to not disturb guests.  Good news is it is almost finished.  Desk staff very nice and helpful.  Breakfast choices excellent. Location great. Enjoyed and would absolutely recommend.
",5,2018,06,29
228,Very functional ,"Decent size, comfortable room and contemporary design. On the one hand, it’s a little out of the way and not right next to the main tourist attractions such as Trinity College and Temple Bar. However, it was only about a 15-20 minute walk to these sights, walking along the river and immediately next door to Epic, the very interactive Irish emigration museum. Also immediately outside the door is a bus stop for just about everything - city buses, airport bus, the various Hop-On-Hop-Off buses.",4,2018,06,27
228,potatoes,"the food was very nice the potatoes were lovely. Everything including service, staff and general tidiness was perfect; the most wonderful thing however was the dining experience with some incredible potatoes.",5,2018,06,27
228,"Good size room, very comfortable, air-con, quiet room and an excellent night’s sleep","I stayed here one night on business. I found the Hotel to be very good. For the price you pay, I think this is one of the better hotels at this price point, in this call in Dublin. I have stayed at a few hotels in Dublin on business, and this is the best so far. I will defiantly use them again next time I am in the City.

It is very close to the city centre, just a short 10min walk, also the Dublin Bus Route passes the hotel on route to the airport which is excellent.

Food was OK, Breakfast was good. However this is where I withdrew a start and rated Very Good instead of Excellent.  I understand peak time is busy, however there were empty tables and a long queue. There needs to be more staff on, as we were waiting whilst the staff member took payments, discussed with customers whether they paid, and all the other activities in checking guest details, and showing them to the table. Two members of staff at breakfast would have made a great difference and prevented the frustration of waiting in line when the breakfast was there, tables were available, and I had paid as part of the room.

Other than that this would have received an excellent from me. Good size room, very comfortable, air-con, quiet room and an excellent night’s sleep",4,2018,06,26
228,Just ok,"The location and room were nice. It would have been nice to have help with our bags. 
The gentleman who seated us for breakfast, overcharged for a young child. He seemed very distracted, although it wasn’t very busy. 
The front staff did correct the price. ",3,2018,06,25
228,Excellent Experience JUST North of the Liffey,"Stayed at this property on a recent trip to Dublin.  It is located JUST North of the River Liffey, but it is still very central to all of the locations you might be interested in walking to in order to see the sights.  We walked to Trinity College, Temple Bar, Christ Church Cathedral, St. Stephen's Green, and St. Patrick's Cathedral with no problem.  We did end up using a hop-on-hop-off bus as well, which got us to Guinness Storehouse a bit farther away.  Breakfast was nice (we had the full breakfast, but continental options were plentiful.)  Room was well appointed, very clean, and obviously newly renovated.  If you are looking for a nice family-friendly hotel that is not right in the thick of the noise of Temple Bar, this is a terrific option.  Parking was convenient in a garage around the corner from the property.  ",5,2018,06,24
228,Room with a river view,A room overlooking the Liffey river. What more could u ask for.  The rooms are good size for Europe and the air conditioning is great. If you have ever stayed in Europe you know how bad the air conditioning can be in hotels. The food is good in the restaurant. They have a breakfast buffet with made to order omelets that are great. It’s a brisk 10 min walk to temple bar area and many great restaurants.,5,2018,06,24
228,Another excellent stay," A fourth visit to this excellent hotel, great location not to close or too far from from the sights and sounds of Temple Bar, O’Connell Street etc.

Mary and the staff are excellent and nothing is too much for them. Great hearty breakfast that sets you up for the day.",5,2018,06,24
228,excellent hotel,"This hotel is about 5-7 minutes farther from the typical tourist attractions than I would have liked however it excelled in other areas.  The front desk crew was extremely helpful with all of our needs.  I have never given much importance to this aspect of a hotel stay but in this instance it made a huge difference.  They gave directions, called taxis, etc., etc.  The hotel is located on the River Liffey and next door to the Emigrant Museum.  Oddly enough this makes your walking back from your day of sightseeing easier  because you basically can't get lost when you have those two landmarks to guide you.  The rooms are recently renovated and are comparable to any other Hilton Hotel's quality and room size.  The only downside I can mention is that the food isn't great.  It's not awful, just not real good.  Other than that I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,06,23
228,Convenient location and wonderful experience,"We ended our 10 day trip at this location.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a lot closer to the City Center than what I thought when I booked the hotel. The Temple Bar District and other attractions were within walking distance and the staff were extremely helpful with directions. The Airport bus drops off and picks up right in front of the hotel so it made it very convenient. One other upside...it had air conditioning. This was our 4th hotel on the trip and the ONLY one with air conditioning. Ireland was having some unseasonably warm weather during our stay! The only thing that wasn't the greatest here was the food in the restaurant. Our first meal there was okay, but the second one wasn't all that great and we chose to eat somewhere else for our other meals. Maybe the chef was having a bad day so I chose to still give the hotel a 5 as I was very pleased overall with the rest of my experience.",5,2018,06,21
228,Great hotel,"I stayed here for 4 nights with my husband and his brother (room with 2 queen beds). We had a nice view to the water. The beds are really comfortable, I've never slept so good in a hotel room. The room and the bathroom are very clean. Apparently the walls are very thick, we didn't hear anything from outside or the next rooms. We didn't eat breakfast here, but dinner was very good at Oly's Bar & Restaurant. The menu has symbols for people with allergies. I'm a coeliac and didn't have any problems finding something gluten free to eat. We were at the bar once, I would also recommend it. Staff in the hotel is friendly and helpful. The hotel is right in the middle of the city. We only took the bus once, to get to the botanic garden. Everything else can be reached by foot. I would definitely come back here.",5,2018,06,20
228,Great Place,"Spent 3 nights there, 1 at beginning of our trip and 2 at end. Close to airport and cruise docks. Bus stop in front of hotel and easy walking to downtown attractions. Great Breakfast, very helpful people at front desk, Bar is nice too. 
Rooms are very nice.",5,2018,06,19
228,Stuck in the snow,"Prices for food and drinks a bit steep. 

Not sure rooms are the biggest but very comfortable. 

Food good if pricey. 

Parking a joke. You have to ask for the place to be opened up and faff around. 

Plenty of reception staff. ",4,2018,06,18
228,Good Choice For Those Training Into Connolly Station,"After beginning our vacation in Belfast and training to Dublin's Connolly Station, it was nice to have a place to crash only a few blocks away.  The weather was nice and we casually strolled from station to hotel in about ten minutes.

The hotel has hop on-hop off tour bus stops directly in front (we used the green Go Dublin bus), which is super convenient.  At one point, we asked them to call us a cab and that got there in about five minutes.  By the way, the cab driver does not, in fact, always come in and call your room number, so wait out front, not in the lobby as the staff might suggest, especially if you're in a rush.

There are outdoor bars/restaurants with a kind of youthful, noisy vibe right around the corner and we also found a quieter pub/restaurant just beyond those that we liked for dinner.  Other than that, you're a little farther off the beaten path than something closer to, say, Temple Bar or Trinity College, but nothing that a quick bus or cab fare can't cure.

The hotel is nice and clean.  Some rooms, including ours, look out on the river, which was really nice.  Ask for one of those.  We were up about 5 or 6 floors, so traffic noise wasn't a problem.  If you pay a little extra, you get a discount on breakfast and it's ample --- the typical Irish spread of meats, cheeses and various fruits and veggies.  

The Airlink bus to the airport picks up out front, too, but we did notice our Airlink bus (which we ended up boarding earlier in the route) zooming right past some people waiting at this hotel, so I'm not sure what was up with that.  We were pretty crowded, so our driver may have just decided he had too many people.  That would be a problem for Hilton guests, however, if all the drivers felt that way! 

Busy hotel, but nice with staff that seems interested in helping, even when the front desk is a little busy.",5,2018,06,18
228,Good location,"There was renovation going on when we visited. We didn’t hear anything when in our room. 

The room was okay. The staff were friendly. 

I am a diamond member. We received two bottles of water because of that. 

The breakfast was crowded: the tour groups.  The omelette cook was very quick. 

The trinity college is within walking distance. About 15 minutes. 

There is a bus station and a train station nearby. We went to Belfast by bus. Very convenient.",4,2018,06,16
228,Friendly staff and hotel located with easy access to all transportation,"I chose the Hilton Garden Inn due to location and participation in their frequent stay program.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it is only a 5 minute walk to the Red Line Luas which can be used to get anywhere. They recently extended the Green line so that it connects with the Red Line at McConnell Street.  Amenities were good but the breakfast area can become pretty busy.  I walked next door to a mall where one could buy scones, oatmeal, coffee, hot sandwiches, etc. and the prices are reasonable.  I took several side trips and found the Red Line was convenient.  Only negative is that the only ""switch"" outlet for my 110 electrical equipment was in the bathroom.  Luckily I brought a converted that I used 2 years ago in Lisbon.",5,2018,06,15
228,Comfy clean and modern,"Lovely welcoming reception area, polite staff. Rooms are clean and bright and complimentary toiletries together with tea and coffee making facilities. Beds are comfortable with plug sockets accessible to charge iPads etc. Towels are big and fluffy which is rare in hotels they are usually awful but this is not the case here. Bar and restaurant in hotel only one rose wine, would be better with more choice! Would definitely return",4,2018,06,13
228,Nice room; Nice location ,"Hotel contained two double beds for our family room. The mini-fridge was a nice addition. Air conditioned rooms. The location was great. We walked to all of the Dublin locations we wanted to visit including the Guinness factory, St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the Book of Kells at Trinity. ",4,2018,06,13
228,Perfect Stay,"I chose this property because of its location to the cruise port and also easy walk to city center and being Hilton honors member I had some points I could use. We were very pleased with our stay here our room was extremely quiet, clean well appointed. The front desk staff was extremely helpful.  We had family members arriving the next day and we were able to secure them a room early.  I chose a quiet room facing the back...not the river. 
Close by are restaurants, M&S Simply food, FRESH market, EPIC Museum, Famine Memorial .Very short scenic walk to O’Connell St. 
Also Airlink express bus 757 Stops right in front of the hotel and it cost seven euros from the airport.",5,2018,06,12
228,Very Nice Stay ,"Myself and my Fiance stayed here for 2 nights on the 3rd and 4th of June and we wasn't disappointed at all.

The hotel is located close to Temple bar and also has a bus stop for the airport link bus and hop on and off buses which is ideal for guests who don't want to walk or can't walk round Dublin.

The hotel was undergoing an extension and I have seen some reviews regarding the noise etc but we never had any issues what so ever and the building work doesn't start till after 9 so it's not a problem at all.

The hotel itself is really nice throughout and the rooms are spacious and comfy with everything you need, the staff are all friendly and polite as well as being very helpful.
The breakfast is really good with everything you need to start the day off, from cooked breakfast to cereal and fruits.

Overall our stay at this hotel was really nice and we would stay again, we had no complaints about anything and we both agreed that the hotel was very comfy and very clean which you always expect from an Hilton chain.

Thank you for a lovely stay. ",5,2018,06,11
228,Excellent,The Hilton Garden Inn is within walking to everything in DUBLIN. We enjoyed staying there and I would come back again. The staff were very helpful. They went out of there way to help us with tickets and showed us their laundry facility.,5,2018,06,10
228,A great location,"We stay for 2 nights in Dublin at this hotel. It is on the north side of the canal, making it easier and quicker to get to the airport and tour pick up locations. It is a short walk to Trinity College and the tourist areas.
It is on a main street, yet quiet.

Breakfast was good with an omelette station, but crowded with tourists.

We did not have a car at this point in our trip.

Room was just redone and very attractive and large. There were the usual and expected US high end travel hotel facilities.",5,2018,06,10
228,Great popular stay in Dublin,"Stayed 2 nights and found this hotel a real gem. We stayed at 2 other Garden Inns in the past month (NYC, London) and this was hands down way superior. It has just been completely renovated with new everything, has an efficient staff, 
and also an excellent restaurant that should have reviews of its own. It is located on the Liffey about 4 blocks from O’Connell St. The airport 747 bus drops off and picks up right in front of the hotel, so you can travel there for 6 euros instead of a 30 work cab. Fantastic breakfast included (at least for Hilton gold members).",5,2018,06,08
228,excellent,"we were staying here 3 nights prior to a cruise. Arriving about 10 AM after an overseas flight, the front desk was able to get us our room right away. In fact the front desk staff was very knowledgeable and helpful throughout the stay. They were able to make us dinner reservations in restaurants that told us they were booked and arranged cabs to the port at the conclusion of a road race that closed down the main street. The location of the hotel was ideal for sightseeing. i highly recommend the property",5,2018,06,07
228,Good standard and good breakfast,"A large hotel with good standard. Good room size and nice bathroom with tub. Breakfast was very good, incl fresh made omelets and waffles. 15 min walking distance to the centre (trinity, temple bar), so not ideal if you have trouble walking. But area is quiet and nice. Recommended. ",4,2018,06,07
228,2 Night Stay in Dublin,Nice hotel with a very pleasant and nice front desk.  The hotel is within walking distance to Temple Bar area and also to Trinity College.  The Airlink bus stop from the airport is also directly across the street.  Rooms were clean and no noise issues during our stay.  Would stay here again if in Dublin.,4,2018,06,06
228,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful experience at the Hilton Garden Inn. I had a fabulous room which was on the 7th floor facing the river. No noise issues during my stay as construction appears to be winding down.
Staff was very accommodating and helpful during my stay.
Main area of town easy access about 10-15 min- easy walk.
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay

",5,2018,06,05
228,"New, Modern, and Convenient","We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and appreciated the river view upgrade (HH member), buffet breakfast with decent coffee at clean, modern atmosphere.  It was an easy walk to Temple Bar, Grafton Street, Guinness Brewery and St. Pat's Cathedral and back to hotel.  Okay, maybe it wasn't easy, but we walked an average of 15 miles per day could eat a Rolling Donut and a lot of fried foods with little guilt every day of our trip. The front lobby staff were very helpful and professional.  Our room was cleaned daily, the modern conveniences made our stay very comfortable.  
The only discomfort was walking back to the hotel later in the evening and having to pass by the homeless (but harmless) element that hangs out at the original custom house building.  I would stay here again.",5,2018,06,04
228,Beautiful Hotel,"Great customer service, Comfortable, Spacious, Clean rooms,  The hotel is beautiful with great amenities. Close to everything great location, The staff with very accommodating and courteous. I highly recommend.",5,2018,06,04
228,Convenient hotel for those who are driving,"We stayed here for two nights in late May 2018 and chose this hotel for the city location but also because we had a rental car and needed a nearby car park. We were able to park around the corner (would have been able to go directly from the car park to the hotel except for some construction), and the hotel arranged for half-price parking ($18 per day instead of $36). The location was great for walking to downtown attractions including Trinity College and the Temple Bar area. We had a quick breakfast at the coffee bar in the lobby each morning and had some beer and cocktails in the hotel bar each evening. The front desk and bar staff were efficient and pleasant, and the room was clean and met our needs. We would recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to be close to bars, restaurants, shopping and attractions but who also needs parking.",4,2018,06,04
228,Great location ,"We spent 4 days at this hotel and was impressed with the location. As a diamond member, we were able to upgrade to a nicer room and get free breakfast. The hotel staff were friendly enough and there is a kiosk in the main lobby for you to buy tickets for all kinds of activities around Dublin and even day trips. The hotel was fairly busy when we were there and it costs 7 euros for 1 load of laundry. The location was great and walking distance to many pubs, and restaurants. 
",4,2018,06,04
228,Great hotel - fantastic location,This hotel was everything you would expect from a Hilton Garden Inn.  The rooms were clean and the service was fantastic.  We ate in the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner during our entire stay and could not have been more pleased.  The location was perfect - close to everything we wanted to do.  The hotel does have some construction going on but it in no way affected our stay.  Need a place to stay in Dublin?  You will not be disappointed with the HGI Custom House.,5,2018,06,03
228,Good location but under renovation,"This hotel is in a good location on the river for a walking city like Dublin.  It is close the EPIC (a must go) and the Jeanie Johnston coffin style ship.   The building was under construction and the noise at time was so loud all we could do was laugh it was so obnoxious.  The front desk apologized but no offer to change or comp anything.  The onsite restaurant, bakery and coffee shop were really nice to have onsite.  We appreciated baggage storage.",4,2018,05,31
228,Close to the Convention Centre,"This hotel is a good choice if you need to be close to the Convention Centre. The rooms are very small and the bathroom barely has enough room to put all of your toiletries out. But, everything was nice and clean. The only real bummer was the fact that this hotel did not have air-conditioning. I walked in and thought the heater was on, bur realized fast that the room was just stuffy because there is no AC. Opening the window was not an option, as the noise from the street is pretty loud. 
The staff though is super nice and I liked that it had a small restaurant and breakfast option. I travel a lot for business, so I'm not overly spoiled. For business this hotel suited me just fine.
One more thing, the hotel is conveniently located near the city centre, so you can walk pretty much everywhere.",3,2018,05,31
228,Excellent stay at Hilton Garden Inn - Custom House - Dublin,"Family vacation  - 6 people over two rooms.  Both rooms with two Queen beds,which was not easy to find in Dublin.  Hotel is new with all the amenities - USB wall jacks, a/c, etc.  Location is excellent - short walk to historic sites, but also very convenient to new docklands area which we liked a lot. Adjacent to new Emigration museum which blew us away - by all means go see it - you will be glad you did. Tip - if you want a light breakfast, get the cold buffet at the HGI for E9.50 vs the full E14 breakfast; that said, fresh made omelettes for a few euro extra is also a good deal.
This hotel overall seems an excellent value in an expensive city, great location, great service - very glad we stayed here.",5,2018,05,29
228,Awesome breakfast ,"Stayed overnight, highly recommend. Modern and comfortable bed. Awesome breakfast and close to amenities. One set back was A/C not working as they’re installing and upgrading, weather unusually hot. Supposedly the A/C is nearing completion.
",5,2018,05,29
228,Good Hotel. ,"Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn over the Bank Holiday. I arrived at about 11:30 and optimistically asked if the room was ready to be told that it was. I had room 334 overlooking the Liffey. 

Check in/out was fast and efficient. I could even pay in Sterling so I did not need to pay a non sterling transaction fee. 

All the staff that I met were all so friendly and helpful. Special mention should be made for Stuart in the bar. Message to management look after him he is good. 

I ate in the restaurant a few times the first time I ate there they brought a jug of iced water. I told them that I did not need it, particularly as there are notices in the bathrooms about saving water. The next time they remembered. I cannot comment on breakfast as I did not have breakfast in the restaurant. The food was delicious. 

Will think of coming back to this Hotel. 

",5,2018,05,29
228,Convenient to All,"This hotel is clean and modern.  Our room was comfortable although the bed could have been a bit softer for me.  The hotel is by no means a luxury property but everything works and the staff is friendly.  The breakfast buffet is really good and provides a good start for the day.  The hotel is no more than a 10 or 15 minute walk to the tourist city center.  It also is right on the airport bus line which makes it real easy and quick to get to and from the airport.  The bar in the hotel is also comfortable if you don't feel like going out in the evening.  Depending on your room, you can get a nice view of the river and city - especially from a higher floor.

Right now the hotel is being expanded and there are some construction impacts - e.g., some scaffolding blocked part of our view.  However, the hotel is managing the project well and it didn't really impact our stay in any significant way.",4,2018,05,28
228,Good overnight pre cruise,"The Hilton Garden Inn Custom House in Dublin is standard chain hotel but that is not a criticism.  Our room was clean,  comfortable and quiet.   The front desk staff were polite helpful and efficient as were the restaurant staff.  Our meals were, as you should expect, fairly standard fare but perfectly acceptable.

We used the hotel for a pre cruise overnight and selected it based primarily on its location near the port and it turned out to be an excellent choice.",4,2018,05,28
228,"Nice HGI, good location","I've stayed at a lot of HGI's in the states, and this is very similar or even better. The hotel is newly renovated and feels like new. Friendly staff and a very good breakfast, which we got complimentary thanks to Hilton Gold status. The location is a bit out of the way, but still easily walkable from Temple Bar, Trinity College, O'Connell street, etc. ",5,2018,05,28
228,Nice Hotel,"We Stayed here two nights.  The rooms are nice and the Staff was great.  It's located right on the river.  The room was kind of hot and stuffy when we arrived, no Air Conditioning.  They brought up a Portable Chiller and that kept it nice.  The parking is Close by, but as an American, it's tight.  The Breakfast Buffet was great, omelettes to Order.  Most of the Cities Attractions are a little walk, but the Hop on Hop off bus stops right out front.",4,2018,05,27
228,Fine Hotel,"Just stayed here for 2 nights to start our vacation.  Had no problems with the hotel.  Our king room on the 7th floor faced the river.  We had no noise issues at all with hotel construction.  Breakfast in the morning was fresh and plentiful.  I could see though, there not being enough space for all guest at busiest eating time.  We didn’t experience that, and totally enjoyed our stay.  As others have stated, excellent location.",4,2018,05,27
228,Great place to stay!,"We stayed here for one night before flying home. Our room was very large compared to other hotels in Dublin and the king bed was very comfortable. We arrived early as we had just finished a cruise and the staff was very accommodating to get us in earlier than 3pm check in. It's convenient to walk to most places, including The Temple District or there is also a bus stop on the corner. Highly recommend!",5,2018,05,26
228,Good hotel in great location,We stayed the one night prior to joining a tour group the next day. We had a room on the first floor at the back of the hotel with a view of the hotel’s renovation works which was a little disappointing as a Hilton Honours member. The room however was modern and comfortable an we had a good night’s sleep. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is well located along the river and next door to The Epic emigration museum. Great for walking. Wifi worked very well.,4,2018,05,26
228,A great place to stay when visiting Dublin!,"My wife, son, and I just spent a week in Ireland to celebrate his graduation from college. We flew overnight on Norwegian Air arriving in Dublin on the morning of May 4. I chose this hotel because we stayed here about 10 years ago when it was a Jurys Inn and we loved the location. I was surprised to find that it is now a Hilton Garden Inn, but it was a pleasant surprise. When it was a Jurys, the hotel was a three star tourist hotel, clean and comfortable, but nothing special. It is now about twice the original size and has been upgraded with bigger rooms, better furniture, central air conditioning, and all the amenities that American travelers look for in a hotel. It is now a four star hotel and is very comfortable.

The staff assigned us a room by about 11:30 and we used the hotel as our base for visiting Dublin. Trinity College, Temple Bar, the shopping district, and the GPO are all within walking distance of the hotel.

The EPIC emigration museum is right next door, as are two great restaurants, Ely Bar & Grill and Urban Brewing, both have great food and drinks and a terrific nightlife on the weekend evenings.   

We never had a problem getting a taxi at the hotel. The tram is one block behind the hotel and Connolly Station is about a 7 minute walk. The DART train can be boarded at Connolly Station. If you are heading to the Guinness Brewery, the tram stops about three blocks from it. The fare is 2.10 euros, while a taxi will cost you 30 euros.

The breakfast buffet was excellent. I think it was about 36 euros for the three of us, and is open until 10 AM, so you can head out on a full stomach!

The front desk staff was attentive and would answer any questions we asked. Bottled water is available in the lobby for one euro a bottle, so stock up before heading out for the day. 

Renovations were still ongoing during our three night stay, but did not interfere with our stay. They should be finishing soon.

Overall, we had a great stay and would return. The hotel is comfortable and modern and the location can't be beat. It is a great place to stay while visiting Dublin.",5,2018,05,25
228,A great find in a great area,"I""d stay here again: clean, great views of the river, wonderful staff, warm greetings, reasonable food choices, and wonderful location just across from a bridge.  I'm so glad we found this Hilton!  The staff stored our bags until we could check in and also gave us a view of the river when we asked.",5,2018,05,25
228,"Comfortable, Dependable and Nice Service","I'd like to give the hotel a 4.5 rating as it is a very good hotel with only one deficiency -- the restaurant.  We stayed there twice in the last 3 weeks -- the first time for just one night when we arrived in Dublin to meet our cruise ship the next day, and then again for 5 nights after our return.  The staff is extremely helpful, including storing 2 of our bags while we did a road trip around Ireland.  The new renovations are making this a much more comfortable hotel -- specifically adding central air conditioning in the rooms. For travelers like ourselves who were on a 3 week trip, their self service laundry with 2 washers and 2 driers were much appreciated.  The hotel is located right across from the Jeannie Johnston Famine Ship, is on the ""blue line"" of the Red Hop-On, Hop-Off bus and taxis are easy to come by.

Just on the restaurant -- breakfast is great so no issues there but one night we had dinner there.  Just skip it.  Pricey and really slow to get food.  Waiter tried really hard but just was our one bad meal in all of our travels.",4,2018,05,24
228,Great Hotel – Great Location,"The hotel is around a 10/15 minute walk away from Temple Bar area along the river.
Our room had a nice fresh modern décor and a very comfy bed; personally we would have preferred a shower cubicle instead of having to climb into a bath to use the shower.  The buffet breakfast was very good quality and there was lots of choice. The hotel is adding an extension/new rooms however the noise did not bother us as it started after we got up and had finished by 6pm.  All in all, a lovely hotel in a great location.",5,2018,05,23
228,Concert Visit,"Stayed overnight for a concert. Very central hotel. Just around the corner from the mayor square luas stop. Only 2 stops away from the 3arena. Also only a 15-20 min walk.
Lovely bar and breakfast was very good. Short walk to O'Connell and Henry Street. Room was lovely and spacious. Very friendly staff. Great location.",5,2018,05,23
228,Exceptionally Well Run,"This is an exceptionally well run hotel that plays well above the Hilton Garden Inn weight class. Clean throughout.  Every member of the staff is professional, pleasant and welcoming.   The breakfast offers a wide-ranging selection and provides fresh, made to order meals.

",5,2018,05,22
228,Great property!!,"Check in was easy. We arrived early in the morning(9am) Of course our room wasn’t ready. They said they would get to it as soon as possible since we had picked the room out already on internet check in. Room was ready at 12.. couple hours before check in. The hotel was sold out as well.Alityle walk from Temple Bar area, but was a nice walk along the river. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. Would stay here again ",5,2018,05,21
228,Terrible hotel,"I stayed one night at the Hilton Garden Inn and it is one of the worst hotel I have experienced in recent times. The service is appalling, the rooms are incredibly noisy (you hear everything next door and from the corridor) and the breakfast is a crowded and disorderly experience. The rates are also stupidly high. One word to summarise it. Avoid!",1,2018,05,18
228,Breakfast mayhem,"Hotels in busy areas - such as the financial area in Dublin - are always noisy and a bit manic. 

However. 

The Hilton has recently added 85 bedrooms and with the influx of guests they have not yet figured out how to manage the number. 

At check-in a guest was at the counter for 20 minutes before I was received. There were two other staff in the back room doing something more important than checking in guests.

At breakfast it was so busy that even though I was guided to a table, when I returned after getting a machine-coffee the table was inhabited by someone else. 

At the egg station, you are assigned a number and you wait at the counter. If you don’t, as happened to me, people are so fed up with waiting that they take eggs that they didn’t order. 

In all, it’s a basic hotel with small rooms, overpriced (£260 a night for me) with Premier-Inn level breakfasts and customer service. 

If you’re here for leisure, all the well know pubs and entertainment are 2km away.

If you want a view of the river, go to the high floors but don’t open a window as it’s on the main road. 

Pretty poor for that amount of money. ",2,2018,05,18
228,Convenient and Mostly Refurbished,"Stayed at the HGI in early May, over a weekend. As mentioned in other reviews, there is construction on the hotel - but mostly on the outside of the hotel and behind. I stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms, which was clean, quiet and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was good, with an omelet station. I used the newly renovated exercise room - which was small, but had two new treadmills and a few other machines.  Overall, the hotel is what you would expect with a HGI. 

As far as transportation, I used the Airport Express (Airlink), which was somewhat confusing at the airport. The automated machine at the airport was out of one-way tickets and three day passes - and there was no one at the ticket stand. In the end, I was able to buy a ticket on board, since I had the 7 euros needed for the trip. As mentioned in other reviews, the bus stop both to and from the airport for both Bus 747 and 757 are just in front of the hotel, and you just need to know the stop (North Wall Quay). I believe it is the 5th stop for both buses, and takes less than 20 mins.  I was never able to find a place to by a LEAP card, which would have helped with in-town buses. However, just behind the Hotel is the Tram Stop (LUAS) which was easy to use when I wanted to go somewhere more than 5 or 6 blocks away like the Jameson Distillery (right off of the Luas stop). 

Staff at the hotel were great. During check-in, the internet was down so they were not able to process my check-in. In stead, they were able to let me into my previously assigned room, and then had me check in later. This allowed me to drop off my bag, change, and go get dinner. Check in was quick after returning. As a HHonors gold, I got breakfast included and a couple of bottles of water.  Overall, I really enjoyed Dublin and the HGI worked out well for exploring the city and getting to and from the airport quickly.",5,2018,05,17
228,Good hotel good location slight inconvenience due to construction,"Good location. Could stop the car for few min to unload the luggage and get it safely tugged into store room. Very convenient being close to centre of city. Room allocated was on top floor newly added. Good decor in room, nothing to complain.
Breakfast was well stocked. It is more of self service since the crowds were large due to easter weekend. Tables were not cleared, we needed to keep the used crockery in some place to get more food.",4,2018,05,17
228,"Nice room, excellent location and view of the Liffey. Rates a bit high.",This property is presently remodeling. The remodeled rooms are quite nice and most rooms look over the Liffey River. I travel to Dublin frequently and find the hotel rates have become quite expensive in recent years and the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House is no exception.,4,2018,05,14
228,"Great, - lovely hotel, lovely rooms,  friendly staff, Great Breakfadt selection, central","First time here and really impressed.
Stewart in the bar could not have been more helpful and really friendly.
All staff I can across good and friendly.
Buffer breakfast selection very good.
Lovely refurbished rooms.
Central location.",5,2018,05,14
228,Great Stay,"I really enjoyed this hotel. The location as great. The staff was pleasant. The construction didn't really affect our stay at all. Our room was very modern and clean. 

We did try to ask the front desk about places to eat and they wouldn't give us any recommendations. They would just point to a general area. I have stayed at other hotels in which they had a list and description of local restaurants. I think that would be nice to have on hand. All the areas they kept sending us to were more shopping areas and it was hard to find an eatery. 

Overall I would stay here again.",5,2018,05,09
228,Not an ideal state,"I have never written a review while staying at the hotel. But I think travellers thinking of staying here needed to be warned. The hotel’s location is great for the conference. The Airlink bus from the airport has a stop really close by. Shopping is within walking distance. Being next to the river allows for a nice run. The check in staff were pleasant and helpful. BUT it’s under renovation and in my room, the Aircon is not working! In a Hilton chain? They placed a fan and a heater in the room. Which is really fine for now as the weather is cool. But opening the windows means the noise from the traffic and renovation work comes right through. Not quite acceptable if you ask me. ",3,2018,05,08
228,Great base to visit the sites,"Great base for both the nightlife and the tourist attractions, most within a 20-30 min walk, but the tram is available round the corner. The Rooms are cleaned daily and the staff are very helpful. The locality of the hotel is excellent to access the Local night life, not too touristy and far enough away from the Temple Bar area, so you can get a good nights sleep.",4,2018,05,08
228,As you would expect,"The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House was as you would expect. Clean and comfortable. Staff were pleasant and breakfast good. We ordered room service which was delivered quickly and was delicious.
Location is great. Airport shuttle stopped at door. Easy walk to Trinity College, Grafton Street and Temple Bar. We would highly recommend the EPIC Emigration Museum, which is right next door.
Only slight issue with our stay was the loss of wifi one evening. Current renovations didn’t impact us at all other than the visible external scaffolding and spotting a painter at work in the foyer one morning.
We would recommend this accommodation for a Dublin stay.",4,2018,05,08
228,Great quiet location,"We had a newly renovated and large room at the back of the hotel. Not much of a view, but super quiet. We constantly accidentally slept in because of that. The hotel has several busses that stop right in front, but is easy walking distance to Temple Bar, Trinity College and other tourist attractions. It is located in a business district with many great restaurant options, too. Staff could not be friendlier or more helpful!",5,2018,05,05
228,Busy business and tourist hotel,"Well located steps from Luas and with views on to the Liffey.
Busy during the week with business travelers, and on the weekend with package tourists.
They do a good job in keeping the place functional. Restaurant exceeds expectations fpr the type of hotel it is, but service can get a bit behind.
Small lobby for the volume.
Presently undergoing an upgrade, so competitive pricing while work in progress.",4,2018,05,03
228,"Small fitness center, construction currently going on","This place has a great location and is new and pleasant. I don't know how long the construction is going on, scaffolding covers the front as they expand the hotel. There is a very small fitness center which is good in a pinch, clean rooms and a decent breakfast.  Friendly staff-- only thing is that for the room price I wish they offered more than just instant coffee in the rooms.",4,2018,05,02
228,Hilton Garden Inn,"Stayed here from April 15-22.  The room was clean but extremely hot.  No air conditioning and the windows only open slightly.  We had to keep the portable fan on us all night in order to get any sleep.  Construction also started earlier than they said it would.  If you are looking for an Irish experience, this is not the place.  I don't think there is one Irish employee in this hotel.  Most importantly, BEWARE OF THE BATH TUB.  You'll notice the tub is not flat on the bottom, thereby becoming hazardous when soap and shampoo are added.  On the morning of April 20th I fell in the shower hitting my face on the granite vanity.  When I went to speak to the staff about the hazard, with a bag of ice on my cheek,  I was told ""sorry.""  They then called and had a bath mat placed in the shower.  I believe they are negligent by not having a bathmat in every tub.  I immediately thought of elderly people showering in that tub...so dangerous. I thought my cheek bone was broken.  My neck, back and both knees are still bothering me.  I am disappointed that all they had to say was ""sorry.""",1,2018,05,02
228,Comfortable,"We had a newly remodeled room that was clean and functional. A plus here is the majority of the rooms have a view of the river. Just slightly away from the town center. If you can walk it is an easy and interesting walk into Temple Bar and there are two grocery stores on the street with the tram behind the hotel    The Hop On/Off bus stops here as well as the airport bus.  Easy taxi access to/from airport through the ""tunnel” (€25/€30). A very good breakfast and a nice bar.",4,2018,05,01
228,Lovely Hotel ,"We went for a 3 night weekend break. Room was lovely— brand new fittings—was like were the first people to use it. Staff all fantastic, efficient and friendly. Can not fault the hotel itself for location— Airport Express bus stops right in front of the Lobby, best transfer ever— excellent value for money & location— 10- 15 minutes walk from Temple Bar. Tram stop 5 minutes walk.
Only strange thing was having fish and chips in Ollys Restaurant which was the most bizarre fish and chips ever eaten with soggy bhaji type batter with traces of turmeric leaking out— think the chef that night was a bit confused. Not unpleasant in itself but not what was expecting.
Other reviewers have made comment about the building work. Yes they are improving the hotel but we had no disturbance at all and feel they are managing the process very well. 
Would definitely return to this hotel and loved Dublin and the warm and welcoming Irish people who were unfailing friendly, helpful and courteous.",5,2018,04,29
228,""" Great location and great staff""","We can not say enough about this hotel.  We were very pleased with how convenient it was to travel to and from the Dublin Airport by bus from this hotel. The location is central to any type of public transportation. The stop for the express bus to Belfast is a 5 minute walk away.  
The hotel staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating. The restaurant/kitchen staff was able to provide dinner minutes before closing. To two hungry and tired travelers, that meal was the best ever!! We would not hesitate to spend our next vacation as guests of this hotel.",5,2018,04,28
228,Poor value for money,"This is a completely soulless hotel which mainly seems to serve visitors to the conference centre 3 minutes along the road.

I experienced many little niggles that combined to make me really disappointed in this hotel given the high price charged.

1. No phone in the 'workspace' in the bedroom
2. The wire shelf in the shower allows the shampoo / shower gel to fall between the gaps into the bath
3. No mini-bar in the room
4. Reception was used as a communal lounge for a group who'd ordered a pizza delivery
5. Checking in took for ever - ok, so I asked to shorten my stay by one day....why does it take 5 mins of furious keyboard bashing and mouse clicking to perform this simple task and give me a key ?
6. 14 Euros for a very mediocre breakfast
7. The room was uncomfortably hot - they say they are putting in air conditioning but it's not there yet.
8. The only lights in the bathroom are flourescent tubes - horribly harsh when you wake up in the middle of the night.

But the biggest disappointment is the shower - just a dribble from a fixed shower head which drives me nuts.

All in all, the hotel completely failed its promise of 'eating well and sleeping deeply' - I did neither and won't be back.",2,2018,04,25
228,The staff makes all the difference. Especially Mary.,"I'm very happy to jot down a few thoughts about my family's stay at this hotel. Generally speaking, while this location may share the Hilton brand, it should be noted that this staff, led by fearless Mary, can take on any challenge and succeed. I have first hand knowledge proving it.

First, the obligatory review. Yes, the hotel is under construction, pretty much everywhere. The team has found ways to minimize the affect and if you aren’t looking for signs of construction than you won’t notice much.

The food is very good, especially the breakfast buffet. All the items are fresh, they have an omelet station and it’s all very tasty.

The rooms are quality and some are larger than others, even at the same price - keep that in mind. 

Parking is rough but they do validate.

Now on to the good stuff. The staff is beyond compare. 5 star. It feels like they are all a concierge. We had lost an item in the hotel and Mary et.al turned over every rock for 2 days until they found it. Had they not, it would’ve ruined our trip and they knew it. 

They went way beyond the call of duty for me and my family and that is the main reason HGI will be my hotel of choice for Dublin going forward.

Thank you Mary and team.

228,Overnight Stay,"Very nice hotel that is currently under renovations. Room was spacious, bright and clean. Our room overlooked the river- would be beautiful in summer minus the scaffolding. Had both breakfast and dinner here. Dining area was quite small - raised area at the back of the bar, not very well sign posted. Food was very nice but just a bit slow. Buffet breakfast had all you could imagine. Room was prepaid by my sister but on waiting for our bus i checked my online banking app and the hotel had charged the room to me - no authority to do this as my card wasn’t used for a preauthorisation. Reception manager was quick in fixing the problem and the money was back in my account the next day. Would i stay again? Yes",4,2018,04,22
228,Comfort and Quality at very competitive prices for Central Dublin.,"The room was very spacious, and we had a nice view of the river. The Hotel is very clean, there is always staff around, the breakfast was excellent and the young waitress was very attentive, in fact there was no need for us to ask for more milk, as she used to serve it straight away . The omelettes are very tasty too, all ingredients are fresh.     I would say that this is probably the best location to stay, as it is only 5 minutes walking distance to the busy center of Dublin, but there is no noise from the street at night.
I will suggest Hilton Garden Inn to friends and family, and i would i would stay there again for sure.
Thank you.",5,2018,04,20
228,Perfect hotel location in Dublin,"I stayed here at the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House for a few nights.  This was a perfect location.  
1) Airline Express bus stop is just right outside the door.
2) Next door is EPIC Ireland.  You can walk there for a visit or grab a bite to eat when it's raining outside
3) Hotel is undergone some renovations so my room was new.  I didn't hear any construction noise as some reviewers said.
4) Lots of outlets in the room.  Loved the builtin  USB charging ports
5) Friendly staff
6) Room size was big

I highly recommend this hotel if you're planning on staying in Dublin.",4,2018,04,19
228,Good service & room size,"The room size is refreshingly larger than many hotels in the same category. Service is prompt. Good value for price. Location is excellent with Temple Bar and half penny bridge nearby. 

Night view from room is also excellent",5,2018,04,19
228,Fantastic Hotel,"I have just returned from a 2 night stay with my Mum in this hotel. I was a little apprehensive about staying, due to the refurbishment and building work that is taking place on site. But I did not need to worry, as it did not interfere with our stay.
The hotel is very well appointed. Rooms were a nice size with really comfortable beds, lovely quality pillows,  safety deposit box & mini fridge. 
We ate in the restaurant both evenings as we thoroughly enjoyed the food.The manager of the restaurant could perhaps be more friendly but we mainly dealt with the waiters who were all very mannerly, polite and very efficient at their job. Staff on the front desk were also very mannerly and we were never left waiting. The Luas stop is right behind the hotel and links you straight to the city centre , train station and 3 Arena.  We would definitely stay here again, I just hope when the refurbishment is complete that the accommodation prices do not increase.",5,2018,04,18
228,Good value & good location,"This Garden Inn is just at the end of being updated, so it’s all fresh and comfortable. Location is great. Rates are (by Dublin standards anyway) not unreasonable. Best of all, their staff really are great- helpful, and really try to make you welcome.",5,2018,04,17
228,Not bad considering...,"We stopped for one night stay between flights. The choice was mostly done on price and easiness to get to hotel and back from the airport using Airlink express. From their website we knew hotel is undergoing extension but figured as we will be there only at night, construction noise will not be such distraction.
Hotel pitches above its weight in terms of facilities, I would have expected such lobby and the rooms at full service Hilton. Everything looks new and works (mostly - we had problem with shower flow that management was unable to fix, so they offered to either move us or give a free breakfast. As we stayed one night only we chose breakfast).

One should note that the hotel is not exactly in the city centre in its usual understanding - O'Connell/College green, it's about 15 minutes walking distance.

Breakfast was quite reasonable with a lot of choice and signature Garden Inn waffle makers. Internet was free and reasonably fast. 

Overall a very good option, if price is right. Management however can improve some aspects of service to make it even better experience, such as:
- I have asked for the quiet room which person doing the check in completely ignored as she promptly put us in the room facing elevator lobby soI had to go down to get us moved somewhere else (another option was to listen to going up and going down announcements fro under our room door for entire night). If that person should have listened, it would have saved me a trip downstairs). The person doing the check in was also in training and seem to have difficulties navigating her ways around. That would be fine but she spoke English with such an accent I was barely understanding what she is talking about.
- Coffee at the breakfast is ridiculous. They have installed expensive bean to cup coffee machines, but then gutted them to only produce ""Americano"". Is it that hard to have it produce espresso and cappuccino as well?",4,2018,04,16
228,Under Construction!!,while they are making great strides the hotel is under major construction on the outside and on certain floors internally.  The parking to the Hotel is terrible you have to park in the garage way behind the hotel and walk around to the front.,3,2018,04,16
228,Ticked all of the box's for us.,"The express bus from the airport drops you at this hotel and only costs 7 euro. The hotel itself is a 5 minute stroll from the city centre. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable, the staff are helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very good. Our room overlooked the river which helped to relax and enjoy.

I cannot think of anything negative about this hotel, and for short break its quite reasonably priced given the location.",4,2018,04,16
228,Made us feel welcome,"The hotel is very easy to get to from the airport, take bus 757 get off at Custom House stop, €7. We arrived at the hotel at 10:30 am, looking as tired as we felt. The front desk was amazing, got us into a room, offered us water, and answered every question.  We had dinner at  the house restaurant Oly's and it was excellent, we received breakfast every morning, and it is big and filling. 
We had an early morning tour, and they provided us a to go breakfast, which was perfect.
This hotel is in the financial district, but very walkable, it is across the street from the Jenne Johnson, which is a fun tour. Beds are comfortable, room clean. We enjoyed our stay, and will recommend ",5,2018,04,15
228,So convenient,"This was right on a bus line, including an express bus to the airport.  Loved the breakfast and the quiet neighborhood.  Right next door to the immigration museum and close to some nice restaurants.  Need more counter space in the bathroom.",5,2018,04,14
228,Great Downtown Hotel!,"We stayed in 3 Hilton Properties while in Dublin and this by far was our favorite.  Unfortunately we couldn't stay at this property for more than one night due to the family room only being available for the one night.  We arrived early and after 30 minutes our room was ready.  Room was modern, fresh, and very clean.  It appears that our room might have been one of the new remodeled rooms.  Our view was obstructed by construction equipment and it is a bit disappointing that we were charged for a river view when you can't really view the river.  Our maid was really nice and helped us find the extra towels (in the wardrobe instead of the bathroom).  The beds were a bit firm for our liking but most European beds seem to be similar.  The elevator was tiny but wait time was minimal.  Ice is only available on ground floor.  Breakfast was busy but had many choices and was good.  This hotel is very convenient to local luas, train, and bus transportation.  The hotel was very quiet for a downtown location.",5,2018,04,13
228,Nice hotel,"I travel to Dublin a good amount for work and I find hotels in general are very hit and miss in the area, more miss on my last few visits!

I was pleasantly surprised to find the HGI to actually be a very nice hotel.

Clean, modern with a comfy bed and working facilities it made a nice change to my norm.

I recommend and would definitely stay again.

",4,2018,04,13
228,HGI Dublin Custom House - Great Location,This was our last stop of a week long visit and 3rd hotel for the week.  Although it had a good mix of western amenities (we were from the US) it still had that warm and inviting Irish feel.  The hotel was in great shape and very conveniently located.  Food and bar were awesome.  Loved it and would highly recommend to either business or family travel.,5,2018,04,11
228,Generic city hotel,"Booked 10 months in advance , to be given wrong room type on arrival ! Changed second night , but didn’t think we needed any refund on departure ! I most certainly did . Rooms of a reasonable standard if rather small . Breakfast extortionate , ate much better at a fraction of the price at a local cafe . Parking more expensive than quoted on booking . Pizza when we arrived late very good . No chance of a relaxing morning with hammering directly above",3,2018,04,11
228,Birthday night ,"Stayed for just 1 night but it was perfect. Got into the centre easily by foot. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was recently refurbished, very nice and clean. Plenty of room for 4 of us in the room. Would stay here again. ",4,2018,04,09
228,"Great, updated property","This is an amazing property which is finalizing updates.  While not in the middle of everything, it is a short walk away.  The updated rooms are nice and spacious with upgraded technology.   Internet worked well. Restaurant service was slow, but food was good. ",5,2018,04,07
228,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for 1 night with the family. Hotel interior is a vast improvement from its Jurys Inn days and it now looks very well and clean. The hotel is doing building works at the moment but we did not find that this impacted our stay any bit. I was well impressed that the room was set up with a fold out bed for one of the kids even though we had not specifically requested it. It was excellent thinking on the hotels part. WE had a corner room so it was very spacious and its a tip to ask for a corner room if you need that little bit extra space. The room was excellent and clean. I did find the noise from the street a bit distracting at night but we still all slept well.
THe bar is nice but its the breakfast that we found to be fab. Excellent value for money with a huge choice of all sorts and all excellent quality. Well worth paying for it.
The location is great for the 3Arena, Bord Gais and the luas stop at the back of the hotel gets you into town quickly. Parking is behind the hotel in a separate car park but you get a discounted rate of €18 per day by staying in the hotel.
Will definitely be staying here again",4,2018,04,07
228,Please tell people you are a building site!,"Stayed 22-23/03/2018. I wish we knew hotel is a building site, obviously they failed to pre-warn us hence this bad review! Very noisy during the day and builders not sticking to allowed noise/work times: 7pm is not an acceptable time to stop making noise/work on air conditioning as EVERYTHING can be heard through air conditioning in every room. Staff slightly disregarding complaints too. Second complaint is about sketchy wifi. Apart from that location is good and breakfast excellent.",2,2018,04,02
228,"Great hotel, perfect location, clean, friendly and comfortable ","I read other reviews just before travelling with some commenting negatively on building works at the hotel, initially I felt disappointed reading these, however after visiting the hotel the works internally are so subtle and well accommodated by all the staff and contractors that they go unnoticed. The staff are friendly, check in was simple and the room was pristine and modern, we stayed for two nights as we were watching Sam Smith at the 3arena everything is within walking distance. There’s an empty mini fridge in the room and drinks and snacks to buy within the hotel, there’s also two shops behind the hotel for beers and wine etc, OLY’S bar is well priced and possibly the cheapest pint of Guinness I purchased whilst in Dublin, I would highly recommend the hotel, and look forward to visiting again.",5,2018,03,31
228,Over priced chaotic mess,I stayed here on Thursday night while i was in Dublin. I used enjoy staying at Jurys going to concerts when i was younger but to say i was dissapointed with my stay would be an understatement we didnt get a lot of sleep and left nearly more tired then when we arrived. We arrived just after lunch to a reception area in complete chaos trying to check in alone was an ordeal. Thankfully i pre paid so all we had to do was collect the keys. About a week before we came as i chose to drive up i contacted the hotel chat support through their website to ask about the car park. The person i ended up speaking to was clueless and unhelpful telling me how long it would take me to drive to dublin from cork which i already know and was not what i asked. Coming from someone who worked with customer service in the same industry for a long time the team could certinly do with some training. We checked into the room and there was 1 double bed and 1 single. The room was relatively clean but a little tight for space considering it was a twin room. The bath especially was quite tight considering neither myself or my sister would be of large size but would like to enjoy a shower without having water go all over the floor. We ordered some room service around 3.30 for a bite of lunch. We got a pizza to share and a portion of chips. The food itself was tasty im currently training to be a chef so i do have high expectations of the food that i eat so my compliments to the chef. But nearly a 40 minute wait was taking the piss a little. The construction noises were also very irritating up until 6pm while trying to relax. Overall we were both quite dissapointed with most aspects of our stay at hilton garden inn. I dont see us returning in the future. ,2,2018,03,31
228,Comfortable and clean ,"I had to take a star away due to the fact of construction work going on. I rang down and asked to be moved to the other side of the hotel. That was no problem and I was also upgraded. I felt my issue was felt with fast and without hassle. Staff are friendly and access to the rooms are secure by card only to access the elevator. So close to Connolly train station and luas line is directly 2mins walk from the front door. Ideal for concerts, games and night outs. Will defo return again. Hopefully construction will be finished lol. ",4,2018,03,29
228,"Good location, clean.","This was our first time in Ireland and we arrived at 6:30am. The hotel check in was not until 3pm and I was prepared ahead of time to wait. I was not prepared for how exhausted I would be though! The front desk staff was kind enough to let us check in 5 hours early after sitting like zombies in their lounge for 3+ hours! Our room was clean and comfortable. It overlooked a construction area but not once were we disturbed by noise. The onsite restaurant is very good for dinner. There aren't many places to eat in the immediate vicinity after 7pm, which is why I gave it a 4. This hotel is on the bus/shuttle line so that was very convenient. There are also taxis onsite if you need one. I was satisfied with our 4 night stay.",4,2018,03,29
228,"Lovely spacious room, Very Clean & Modern","First time staying in this hotel, and would definitely return! Lovely spacious room, with large comfy bed, very modern! Bathroom very clean and large shower! Staff were lovely & friendly! Both myself & my partner enjoyed our stay here! Only 10 min walk to temple bar ",5,2018,03,29
228,Too pricey for all the drawbacks ,"Contraction. Okay. I get that.  One would think the rates charged would reflect that.  Nope.  

Best part was the gym.  Staff was friendly. But that was it. Breakfast was free to most.  We had to pay.  But only once as we figured out fast why it was free.  Not very good. ",2,2018,03,28
228,Great location ,This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. There are few things wrong but they are things that will be fixed once all the construction is done. But if you are planning a trip to Dublin do not let the construction hold you back. With this hotel you are in walking distance from everything. ,4,2018,03,27
228,Ireland Wedding,"We had a family trip to Ireland for a nephew's wedding. I booked the Hilton Garden Inn  because I trusted the name. Turns out it is a recent opening and was converted from  Jurys Inn.
We paid the extra money for the breakfast. That was a disappointment The buffet was not restocked very much and clearly needed to be with the crowd that was there. At one point there was no food on the line and I ended up with toast and butter because the jam jar was also empty. And don't worry about the Hilton reward program it really doesn't matter unless you travel every month all year and are Gold or above.  I am silver and got no benefit for it.
The staff were very polite and professional and seemed to all be in training!
We got to use the laundry facility and the washer broke mid cycle and the staff were very attentive to the problem-they even comped the 2 cycles on the dryer and the rewash of the load. We were very appreciative. It is 3.50 euro per cycle and detergent is provided.
The rooms were a very nice size with 2 queen beds and a table sitting chair refrigerator and coffee service a nice size closet and plenty of room to move around. We booked 2 rooms and each had a safe,hair dryer and ironing board.
The beds were so comfortable not so much the pillows they were very small and  to soft. 
The rooms were very quiet and didn't hear any of the hallway noises one usually hears in a hotel.
The hotel is already expanding with a building project underway to add 2 floors to the current building.
It is located in a very convenient location across from the river and the Custom House-a short taxi ride to anywhere you want to go.
I would recommend Hilton Garden Inn Custom House to any traveler to Dublin.",4,2018,03,27
228,noise,"As other people say in the reviews, the noise is a pain. I told the reception staff on both mornings of our stay that you can't have a notice in rooms which says there may be noise between 9am-6 30pm and then I'm woken by a drill at 8 09am and the next morning a hammer at 8 42am. Either change the times in the notice or you tell the builders to not do anything til 9am",3,2018,03,26
228,Great place,Was a great place to stay with family lovely bright spacious room very clean all staff were lovely treated me and my family well as have two children with autism and they were welcomed. Will be back again soon. ,5,2018,03,26
228,Fab Hotel ,"Stayed here one night as part of a large group, while we attended a gig at the nearby 3 arena. It is a very handy walking distance to the venue. 
The Hilton has made a wonderful job at taking over this hotel. The decor of the bedrooms are beautiful and very comfortable. The breakfast next morning was one of the best I’ve ever received at a hotel, especially for the made to order omelet and the waffle maker. 
Hats off to the staff here who are so kind and accommodating. 
Yes, there was some construction works ongoing during our stay which did start early, but I wouldn’t be put off by this. I would certainly consider booking in again next time we travel east for a gig. 
I really enjoyed my stay here. Thanks to all at the Hilton Custom House. 
",5,2018,03,25
228,"If you can stand the noise, the hotel itself is nice","Unfortunately we were placed on the 4th floor, where the noise above the room started promptly at 8:15 am and did not stop until late afternoon to early evening.  It was irritating and exhausting.

The location was great especially if you were going to/from the airport.  12 Euro round trip on the bus which came every 10 to 15 minutes.  Drops you off directly across the street, and you can catch it right out front.  So very convenient.

The hotel is itself is nice.  Beautiful lobby and restaurant and great staff both at the front desk and restaurant.  There is a nice gym, and a washer and dryer directly across the hall from the gym.  

Connolly Station is just a stone's throw from the hotel which was very convenient.

I did tell the front desk person that it was not worth the revenue to book anyone in that room until construction was over.  He was apologetic, but even with that, I doubt if I will return. 

I have always enjoyed and been treated well at Hilton properties, but this one was a disappointment, especially since I always request a quiet room.",2,2018,03,23
228,Great view of the River!!,"Loved our room, it was the nicest hotel we had during our entire trip. The rooms were clean, modern, and had an amazing view of the river. Its also within walking distance to a great sushi place. J2 Sushi.",5,2018,03,19
228,Great location,"Glad we chose this hotel. Nice room, ongoing construction was NOT a problem. Good breakfast. Airport bus and hop on hop off bus stops right outside. Newly refurbished bath/shower was a little awkward: huge step up, use the grab bars getting in and out.",5,2018,03,18
228,Our first time in Belfast,"The staff was wonderful and very helpful. They had suggestions on what to do, where to go and helped us on every level. The hotel location was great and many things were in walking distance. We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2018,03,18
228,Good location but rather disappointing,"Great location, by the river, with a city bike rental point across the street and the airport bus stop right in front of the hotel.
Walkable distance to the center.

However, I was disappointed by the hotel itself. Bathroom not well cleaned (the pink stains in the bathtub shows the lack of cleaning over weeks!!)
A piece of paper in the room claimed it was now fitted with air conditioning. Maybe, but there was no thermostat to set the temperature -> was cold every night.

Long and narrow corridor to reach the room, with this outdated and ugly wall to wall carpeting I thought only existed in American hotels from the 70s. I certainly hope they'll replace all that once they're done renovating the hotel!!

It was a busy weekend in Dublin, so the stay was definitely overpriced. I've been to better hotels in Dublin in the past, at a lower rate.

Final note, staff was friendly. Thank you to all of them.",3,2018,03,15
228,Perfect,"This hotel is nearby the citycentre. Shuttlebus from the Airport stops in front of the hotel. Staff is very good; polite and very helpfull. Facilities are good.
The bar has very comfortable seats in which you can relax after a long day of shopping. Breakfast is really outrageous. Yummy!!!!
The rooms are very comfortable and clean. 
I certainly will return to this hotel when I am in Dublin. ",5,2018,03,14
228,Amazing 3 stars hotel,"If you take into consideration this is a 3 stars hotel you'll be amazed. If you of course think about Hilton, you shouldn't expect any luxury hotel. Nevertheless the location is perfect (4th stop from Airlink Bus from the airport) and the Hotel is really nice.",5,2018,03,14
228,Could do better,"Recently stayed for 3 nights at the Dublin Hilton Garden Inn Custom House.  A mid sized hotel that Hilton has purchased and is in the process of renovating plus adding more rooms. Rooms are large, well layed out and very clean...no issue there. The problems are generally related to their renovation.  These included noise at night despite the Management claiming work concluded each evening at 6:30pm...not true.  Both myself and a colleague in the next room were disturbed with pipe clanking each evening after 11:30pm. Next, they turn the heat off in the daytime and its not always consistant after that. It was cold in Dublin and so was the room.  I placed 2 service calls, their building engineer responded cheerfully but advised the heat was off due to the works underway.  This made the room uncomfortable. I think they could do a better job that this for their guests.",3,2018,03,13
228,Great hotel ,"First of all yes the hotel is undergoing refurbishment. But I didn’t really notice as I went out all day and evening on the Saturday(I must have gone before work started) So works did not affect me in the slightest. 

My room was massive and clean with a really large comfy bed. I have a lively river view. I also think that my room has good sound proofing as I did not hear any outside noise. 

Staff were friendly and helpful with every need met in the quickest possible time.

I only had breakfast on one morning of my stay(I left before 4 am to catch a flight on Sunday). I have to say it was the best Hilton breakfast to date. I wish all the Hilton’s   served the same quality sausages. Also the food was fresh and well stocked, so there for nice and hot. Coffee was really nice. I would have liked croissants. But that’s not a complaint

All in all I am very happy with my stay and have rebooked for early December.  I am looking forward to my return visit. I will also be excited to see the new refurbished area 

Thank you  Hilton for a great stay!!

228,Rugby Ireland v Scotland ,Just back from a grand weekend in Dublin. Staying at the Hilton Garden Inn With my friend for the Rughby. We could not have wished for a better Hotel for our weekend. It's was fine and easy to get to from the Airport by traveling with City Link coaches It took us Wright to the door step of our hotel 12euros return. When on arriving at the Hotel the Lady at the desk was very helpful and chatty and made our arrival more pleasant.The rooms were spotless The Breakfast & Evening meal was very good as all the staff Morning and night. I would certainly recommend this Hotel to my Family and Friends. And to use this one again. Well done to everyone  there 👍🍾,5,2018,03,12
228,DO NOT STAY - BEWARE,"We stayed 3/8 - two rooms.  You have drag your bags up the street from the parking.  No inside walkway!  NO AC.  The front desk people are almost all ""trainees"" and some hardly speak at all.  Noise and dust everywhere.  This is not the construction - it is the lack of being a good hotel in general.  No one was happy there.  No tour bus information from the front desk, etc.  Horrible experience.  I can't believe this is even in the Hilton chain!!!",1,2018,03,12
228,Fine for a night,"Stayed for a night when passing through Dublin. Its about 10-15 min walk to Temple Bar along the river. The hotel is large and undergoing construction currently, but this wasn't really an issue. Room clean and quiet, check-in smooth although the room was not ready on arrival (albeit we were early). Breakfast buffet was large and good quality, although slow in refilling items when they'd gone. Decent base for Dublin, albeit a little out the way",4,2018,03,12
228,No ability to control temperature of the room,"The hotel itself is quite nice.  The staff are pleasant.  However, there's no ability to control the temperature of the room.  This is one of those times where my American roots are showing.  I've never been in a hotel with heating and air conditioning with no thermostat to control the temperature in the room.  The room itself was quite warm and used the window in an attempt to cool it though the effectiveness was limited.  Getting in and out of the shower with mobility issues may be difficult.  It's a tall step up into the tub.  

The hotel is very well located making it easy to talk to everything.  There's plenty of foot traffic, even late in the evening so you never feel isolated.  The AirLink Express stops right outside the hotel making it very easy to get to the airport. ",3,2018,03,08
228,New Year's Eve stay,"We stayed in the hotel on two occasions and we loved it both times! The second time was on New Year's Eve and it was amazing. All the staff is super friendly, especially Teodora at the reception ( I hope I got the name right, sorry!). Everything in the city center is within walking distance, no need for a car. Breakfast selection great and really tasty. Looking forward to our next stay!",5,2018,03,06
228,Excellent Hotel and Location,"We arrived at the hotel at 9am and was expecting not to get into our room until 3pm, but we checked in and our room was ready and we got the key so this was a massive plus for us. 
The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. 
We had bed and breakfast to which we could not fault, there was such a choice in the food there was a chef cooking fresh omelettes, you had pastries, fruit and yoghurts, eggs,bacon, sausages
, beans, there will be something for everyone. 
We also ate Dinner in the hotel and it was lovely would recommend if you didn’t want to go out. 
The room was clean and tidy as was the hotel. 
Is in a brilliant location and is worth a try. 
 ",5,2018,03,05
228,Weekend stay,"Unfortunately the worst snow and red alert hit Ireland the day before our visit. Our flight made it to Dublin however we arrived a day after the national lock down. 

The hotel is currently undergoing renovation so the exterior is under scaffolding but that did not bother us, just wanting to be inside and warm. 

We arrived at the hotel at 9am to see a snow clad Dublin centre. Thankfully at check in we were given keys straight away to our room which was a god send as I honestly do not know how we would have held on to the usual 3pm check in time. 

The hotel was clean, immaculate, nicely presented and modern looking. I know works are being done but there was absolutely no disruption to getting around the hotel. 

Our room was on the 2nd floor to the rear of the building. Our view was of some streer behind us -deserted owing to the heavy snowfall. 

Room was clean and presentable with a very clean and modern bathroom. Beds were decent and comfortable. There was a tv with several Irish and UK channels, a desk, electronic safe and a mini fridge which you can use. There was free wifi throughout the hotel for guests. 

No complaints about the room at all. 

We ate in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast. Breakfast was a buffet selection. Nice choice of hot and cold foods. Some of the nicest sausages and I am not a big sausage eater normally but these were nice. Also the scones were delicious,tasting homemade. 

All of the staff were helpful and polite everywhere. 

Dinner was nice to in Oly's Restaurant. A decent dinner menu with different choices. Prices not terrible, more what you expect in a city. 

I liked this hotel and would stay here again on a visit to Dublin.",4,2018,03,05
228,"Good stay, good location","Stay here with friends for a weekend and have to say it was genuinely enjoyable. Staff were all friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and tidy and the location was great. 
There was some refurbishment going on but were told about it prior to staying and to be honest, didn’t even notice it. There’s a good hotel bar and the couldn’t really fault the breakfasts, pretty much what you’d expect. So thumbs up from me and would definitely return again! ",4,2018,03,05
228,Rugby Weekend ,"Advised in advance of ongoing upgrade works but in truth there was little disruption or noise whilst we were there.
Rooms very clean with all the usual facilities, tea coffee making , ironing, hair dryer and T.
Bathroom had bath and  shower over.
Clean and tidy with a very good shower. Plenty of hot water.
Great bed and no one in our party of 14 had complaints about a not getting a good nights sleep.
Only had breakfast on one day as we were out most days.
Good choice of both continental and full breakfasts, and the food was of good quality.
The bar and lounge areas were nice and tidy and had a very good selection of drinks.
Nice Gym with a good supply of equipment and it’s open 24/7.
Check in and out very easy with friendly polite staff.
Hotel is about 15 minutes walk from the main shopping areas, there is a bus stop just outside and taxis.
On the  bus route from the airport.
All in all except for the Rugby score a great weekend.

",5,2018,03,04
228,Unexpected stay,"Recently had to spend the night here due to the snow. Was pleasantly surprised by the place. Great location in the IFSC, so near the city. The place felt brand new and they're adding a couple of floors to the building (expect to see scaffolding). 

The room itself was perfect, although small. Bed was very comfortable, nice Samsung TV, fridge and safe. Shower was excellent and the toiletries and towels provided were of good quality. One small complaint was that the toilet paper was cheap quality, you would expect better from a Hilton. 

Enjoyed a nice chicken curry for dinner in the restaurant and a great cooked buffet breakfast. They have a nice bar that's open until 130am. Would certainly recommend this place. ",5,2018,03,04
228,good location for shopping taxi from airport 7 euros each,"helpful staff  at check in, room very tidy ,and  quiet at night comfy bed.breakfast  plentiful.and everything hot.public transport  bus stops 10 yards from entrance  to hotel.there are three lifts.so there is hardly any queuing",5,2018,03,03
228,Poor Service levels,"Hotel itself is nice, food was lovely. The staff overall excellent except for the bar and restaurant staff, very slow and forgetful. 

Couple of times we asked order a drink or coffee, the staff member took the order and disappeared without handing it off to someone else.

",2,2018,03,03
228,Would recommend for a city stay,"The hotel is very well positioned in the centre of the city, alongside the canal that runs through it. Walking distance to all bars & restaurants with a long walking distance to the Aviva Stadium and Guinness Storehouse.
The rooms are satisfactory and the restaurant/bar area is a very good size. Excellent selection for breakfast however we did not experience the restaurant.

It is difficult to comment on the value as we booked it as a package deal.",4,2018,02,28
228,Dublin visit,"This hotel has very nice rooms!  Their on site restaurant was very good. We were given a river view room, however, the scaffolding / construction blocked most of our view. The staff here could smile a little bit more and maybe provide better info on local restaurants. This hotel was not as close to night life and shopping as I would have liked, but again the rooms were nice. ",3,2018,02,27
228,Great location ,"Right across from the water and tall ship and just down from the EPIC museum- also a stop for the “do dublin” sight seeing bus and airlink. 
Comfortable and clean rooms, friendly staff - only “negative” is breakfast isn’t included and (from my experience) you can’t just get a coffee during “breakfast.” Food at the restaurant was delicious and the fitness center was clean. ",4,2018,02,25
228,Oh I do Like To Be Beside the Quayside.,"It drew my attention because it is on the River Liffey. Staying near to water with a view is soothing to me, and I thought I would not mind it being a little out of the way for us (generally preferred).

Harbourmaster Bar and Restaurant was my favorite discovery in the vicinity.  There was a Christmas market just a few steps away that appeared to be just getting started.  It is a couple of miles away from most of the touristy things we did.  Not bad if you don't want to be right in the center of it all. Summertime must attract loads of visitors to that area.  It was a bit too cold to cycle around the river as I had hoped to, or linger near the water.  A cold wind pushed us back.  

The first words from reception when we arrived around 8am was that we were early.
That was not what I wanted to hear after booking online and making a point that we would like an early check-in...Also rang to confirm our booking – again requested early check-in and in total I had 3 encounters with the hotel before we arrived and during each I mentioned the request. 

Fair enough, if they do not have rooms available but our faces sank being jet-lagged and needing sleep. I was surprised to hear her say they had a room available and she would put us on the first floor to avoid some of the construction noise.  Was a bit confused as to the reason for pointing out that we were early.  Since I booked in August for a December stay and selected the options for a high floor with river view and early check-in – I was not thrilled with the lower tier offer but managed to get the keys to the fourth floor.

Transportation (The Airlink) from the airport is convenient and stops close to the hotel, but we weren't aware that it did not start until 7am on Sundays.  We had already purchased Hop on Hop Off tickets* that included Airlink travel.  Our plane arrived early (5:00am). After lingering at the airport to wait for the transport to wake up and collect us- we were losing the battle to try to stay awake and really needed a quiet space.

*Btw...the Hop on Hop Off did not have 3 routes as listed.  The driver was enjoyable but not sure I would recommend it.  Our understanding was they cut 2 of the routes (ones we wanted to take) – we did not finish the whole tour so perhaps we missed out on the best parts.

The hotel construction was not taking place on Sunday, our first day there, but did wake us up Monday and was loud enough to motivate us to get out.  That wasn't a bad thing for us as we were only visiting for 2 days and did not intend to spend it at the hotel.  Renovation noise was coming from the lower and ground floor leaving us confused about the recommendation to sleep on the first level.

The room had an adequate view and is a fair enough size for us. Bed was comfortable and we would have loved to have spent many hours in it to have caught up.  Construction did not bother us for the amount of time we were visiting, but would imagine it is not ideal for someone that needed quiet time there while they're building. 

I could not get enough hot water for a decent bath or shower.   The bath had some dark spots in it that may have been from a drip or some kind of cleaning fluid left behind. It occurred to me that may have been why reception tried to steer us to a room already updated. There was no air conditioning. Although it was December it gets stuffy.  Changing out the stale air should be a requirement of all hotels.  Hopefully, it is in the finished accommodations. We opened the window and were woken up by a motorbike parade. Had a laugh about it because we did want to get up and out.

Reckon the refurbishing has been a challenge for the associates that are there daily.  The Reception crew were attentive, gave us helpful information, and were very likeable.  

Our breakfast was good and we enjoyed drinks in the pub.  Servers were nice enough but not as amiable as front desk.

The rate was better than the Hilton down the way, but I think it should include breakfast and an evening cocktail or starter.  In my opinion all hotels (especially one booking during restoration) should do that...offer better price points.  We would spend more at their location if they included enticements.

Would book here again during a different season.  It would be interesting to see the completion of the renovation...  Provided they installed a/c.;-)  Reckon the rooms are muggy in summer without airflow.  If we stay in December again for only a couple of nights, I will book a different location because of it being too cold near the river and our being fatigued.",4,2018,02,21
228,Very enjoyable,"Great hotel with lovely staff, good food and more important, modern and clean rooms. Love staying here and do so frequently. Just on the outskirts of the huddle and bustle of the city centre but very accessible to a wide range of restaurants. Would recommend.",4,2018,02,19
228,"Perfect location, great luxury","We had booked another hotel that was terrible, we moved here for 4 great nights.  It had everything we needed.  Nice bar, great breakfast, well equipped rooms.  We actually met several of the staff at a bar and told them our plight, the, manager after leaving the bar went back to the hotel and booked a room for us!  A level of service that was unbelievable.",4,2018,02,19
228,Construction site & disorganized room service ,"Tried to order room service and was told I didn’t have credit (even though I wasn’t asked for my card details on check in).
1st hotel I have stayed in that didn’t allow me to buy food from room service!
Thanks

",1,2018,02,18
228,Very impressed ,"Hotel is brilliant, it was explained on arrival the renovation work is on going and there could be some noise during the day, but as it happened this was minimal.
The rooms were spotless and contemporary, and the bed was one of the most comfortable we have ever slept in st any hotel.
The staff were polite and very helpful.
The bus stop to and from the airport is directly outside the hotel so couldn't be more convenient. There is also a tram behind the hotel which takes you directly into the city centre or to walk it takes aprox 15 mins.
The meals in the restaurant are second to none. Would highly recommend this hotel for a break in Dublin. Very impressed.
",5,2018,02,18
228,A lovely family stay,"Having stayed in Dublin many times before I noticed the prices had risen quite a bit, however this one consistently came out lowest.  Let me first dispel the building work situation.  They have placed warning after warning about it on their website and still people moan when they get there.  They kept to their word about the times it was active and we found absolutely no problems whatsoever apart from the scaffolding on the outside.  You are out most of the day anyway so why should it matter?  
Anyway onto the main bit.  To echo previous reviews, great rooms, super clean and tidy, great food and the bar prices aren't much higher than outside (a rarity).  Staff lovely and on the last day my son was very poorly with a bug.  As our flight was later in the day we spoke with staff and they gave us a complimentary room for a few hours so he could get some sleep.  We couldn't have been more grateful and a big thumbs up for the ladies on the desk.  
With regards to distance it is about 10 minutes walk to O'Connell Street and is just about far enough away for a bit of peace and quiet biut close enough if you want the action.  This will certainly be our home next time we visit later in the year.  Thank you",5,2018,02,18
228,A perfect weekend with Family,A perfect hotel for a visit to Dublin with a pleasant view over the River.Although there was work taking place in the hotel where they were installing new air conditioning this did not distract from the excellent service and hospitality that made for a perfect weekend!,5,2018,02,16
228,Construction in progress.,"Great hotel, nice staff and horrid noise from 9:00-21:00.  Scaffolding surrounds the building and it sounds like they are excavating through solid rock.  This is NOT the place to stay if you want peace and quiet.",1,2018,02,16
228,Great location,"Stayed here recently for a concert in the 3 Arena. it is located about half way between the arena and O'Connell street (about 10 min walk either way). Ideal if you are attending a concert or just for shopping. Staff were lovely and very helpful, rooms were spotlessly clean, nice bar and coffee doc. Food looked lovely although we didn't eat there. the restaurant was very busy. Would definitely stay here again",5,2018,02,15
228,Luxurious ,"Lovely hotel and room.Stayed as attending concert at 3 arena. Room has iron, air con and fridge. Comfy beds . Only downside was there is construction work going on and drilling started at 8am which was very noisy and woke us. ",4,2018,02,13
228,"Spacious, Comfortable, Construction is going on","This hotel is within walking distance of almost everything.  It's a little further out from Temple bar...you have to walk a few more blocks to get places but it's really not bad.  It's right next door to EPIC- which has some great quick meal places attached.
The hotel is larger than other Hiltons in Dublin...rooms, hallways, workout center, and restaurant all have plenty of space.  The facilities themselves are great.  
I didn't know until about three weeks before my trip that there was going to be construction. (The warning popped up in January. I had made reservations in Oct/Nov)   So I was worried that the construction would be loud but all the other Hilton rates had gone up so I couldn't move my reservation.
This is the thing--the construction is for real...every day there was work being done on elevators, in hallways, outside the building.  Noise starts about 8:30 am. It didn't bother us, though.  The only thing that happened that was inconvenient was an electric panel caused a false fire alarm to go off in the early morning one of the nights of our stay.  It took the staff a while to get an engineer down to stop it.  Obviously, there was nothing the staff could have done to help it but they did send out a letter of apology the next morning.
The breakfast is great, food in restaurant is great (although a bit expensive), the staff is very polite and attentive.
I would recommend the hotel and I will definitely stay there again.",4,2018,02,12
228,NO HOT WATER,"we stayed for one night in October /17 and hotel was fine till I took my shower and hot water was a issue then my wife had no hot water it was 10pm and I phoned reception and they would look in to it. Awoke at 5 am as we had a flight out early ,my wife went to see and still no hot water. We packed up and went to desk to catch transport to airport and front desk stated they did not now of any problem. next customer same problem . I heard back from hotel and they offered me a deal next time I came to Dublin tried to use deal ,guess what got a better deal at another hotel from trivago",2,2018,02,10
228,Came away smiling - they couldn't do more for us!,"Excellent example of how a hotel should be run.  Our first floor room was comfortable, clean and provided for all our needs. The hotel is in a good location across the river from the main centre but within easy walking distance and with ample directly available links for buses and taxis - getting about is not a problem The Hilton breakfast is well worth having and it will set you up for your days sightseeing. Staff are friendly and most helpful. I would not hesitate to stay in the Hilton Garden Hotel on my next visit to Dublin.",5,2018,02,08
228,"Good location, decent room.","Our stay at the Hilton was brief but enjoyable. Standard Hilton room fitted with everything you could need. The location is about a ten minute walk to Temple Bar, meaning perfect for all surrounding attractions. The airport bus also stops right outside in both directions making it ideal. Unfortunately, our trip was a little tainted by the ongoing construction work which we wasn't notified about, in addition to an alarm that was set off at 5am. However, the staff couldn't have been anymore apologetic and these things happen.",4,2018,02,06
228,Excellent ,"Everything I expected and more, I'm planning to get across for a few days in a couple of months socially and will definitely be staying with you again. Slap bang in a fantastic location with bars and restaurants surrounding the hotel. The room itself was large and comfortable with excellent views if the river and city. Thoroughly recommend ",5,2018,02,05
228,A pleasant stay,"Stayed for one night while in Dublin with my wife, there was some work going on around the hotel but it didn't impact the stay in any way.

The check in was swift and very friendly, the room was not huge but comfortable enough and very clean.

Breakfast was very nice with a good selection.

I would have no hesitation staying again.",4,2018,02,05
228,Not the best stay,"This hotel is under going major renovations, and on the whole that is fine. Rooms comfy and beds great. My problem was clanking pipes when the heating came on before 6am each morning. Went on for about 15 minutes and was enough to wake me up - too early. Debated trying to move room but was super busy and was too much trouble by time I found out the first morning. Suspect radiators need bleeding or pipes are aging. ",3,2018,02,04
228,Adaquate hotel,"Adaquate hotel but currently under construction. Parking poor and difficult to find. Location poor - 20 minutes walk to most areas of interest and the one way system adds 10 minutes to a taxi trip.
Room cramped with a king size bed but bathroom was spacious.
Airport bus stop outside hotel is very convienient. Staff are helpfull.",3,2018,02,01
228,probably lovely when the building is finished,"stayed here for 2 nights jan 2018, there was no indication when I booked the hotel in October 2017 that there would be building work taking place. we arrived at around 11am was told there were renovations taking place and there could be noise up to 6pm, what they failed to tell us was it was in the room next to ours. we had a walk around then decided as we had been up since 3am to go and have a rest before going out for the evening, the noise was intolerable my husband went and asked for a different room which they gave us on the other side of the hotel this was still noisy but not as bad. I don't know why they would put people in a room right next to one being renovated when there were others available, the noise went on till 6pm then started again at 9am Saturday morning. if I had been told prior to booking I wouldn't have booked it. The rooms were clean the bar lovely but sadly couldn't see beyond the noise. its quite a walk to the main streets and bars about 20 mins most bars are the other side of the river.",1,2018,01,31
228,"Currently being upgraded, well located and good staff","Spent 20 minutes looking for a/c control as room was very hot - could see a/c grills etc - when going out saw notice advising that a/c was being installed along with extension - went back in and found radiator behind dresser, turned to full - look forward to a/c next time?
Nice rooms, great location by the train station and nice views over the river

Breakfast gets a big thumbs up as they have an egg station - fresh perfectly cooked eggs and a chef ensuring the buffet is always topped up

Would probably give it 5 stars when work complete",4,2018,01,30
228,Recommended ,"So we have just returned from 2 rememberable night in Dublin. The hotel was recommended by family who had stayed in Nov 2018. It was a lovely hotel (work is currently still being undertaken), everything was clean and comfortable. We stayed in room 125 which was right on main road but didn’t hear any traffic. The only thing I did hear early hours both mornings was what sounded like pipes rattling (like the heating was kicking in). I would 100% recommend breakfast very very good. It was about 15-20 mins walk away to temple bar, leisurely stroll along the river. ",4,2018,01,29
228,Lovely hotel,"We stayed here in Jan 18, with friends. This hotel is in an ideal location close to where you want to be! The hotel rooms are clean,spacious and come with everything you need.  We booked bed and breakfast.  Breakfast was amazing .. full English, omletes to your taste,waffles , fruit, cereals. Would reccomend this hotel.",5,2018,01,27
228,Great Location ,"The property is located on a great location, walking distance from the mayor street and have a bus stop right there in case you take the hop on / off deal. Staff is super friendly and the rooms are great. ",5,2018,01,27
228,Great stay,"First visit to Dublin, found this hotel ideal. Room was large, clean and comfortable with a good shower and lovely big thick towels. River view was a bonus! Wonderful buffet breakfast on both mornings. Staff were friendly and helpful and we were not inconvenienced at all by the renovations. 
Airport bus stop is right outside and there is also a stop for the hop on hop off bus tour. We walked everywhere else we wanted to go to, but there seemed to be plenty of buses for anyone who doesn't  want to walk.",5,2018,01,27
228,Very nice,I am just getting around to reviewing but we stayed back in September. We arrived very early in the morning after an overnight flight. We checked in and went to our rooms which were nice but pretty small. I got up just a couple hours later and inquired about a local clinic as my daughter wasn’t feeling well. The front desk was more than helpful and called to make an appointment for her. The clinic was a very short walk away. We were only at the hotel two days but it was nice while it was not in the center of the action it was just a short walk. We ate breakfast at the hotel which was the typical breakfast we found all around Ireland and we also had dinner in the hotel restaurant and it was very good. We did not spend much time at all in Dublin but I hope to return and would definitely stay here again ,5,2018,01,27
228,Perfect location!,Top quality hotel close to public transportation. The construction was no problem for us. It was quite easy to get to the hotel using the Airlink bus. It stop directly in front of the hotel for a low price.,5,2018,01,24
228,Fantastic Hotel and great staff,"Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for a short trip to Dublin, it's a bit of a walk into the city, however we enjoyed the stroll along the river.

The hotel was very clean & tidy as you would expect and we had a reasonably sized room, we didn't spend too much time in the hotel, however the time we spent we enjoyed.

The staff here were great here, I missed breakfast on my last day and they arranged some food for me before we set off on our way home, which I really appreciated.

If your looking for a good quality reasonably priced hotel in Dublin then this is a gem...",5,2018,01,22
228,DO NOT STAY HERE!!!,"Place is a horrible construction zone. It should be closed until they are done with renovations. No pickup or drop off lanes, Construction workers everywhere. Dusty. Noisy. Completely lacking of security. Maybe when they are done in April 2019.",1,2018,01,22
228,Pleasant stay again at the Hilton Garden Inn,"Do have to say have stayed at this hotel before during the early part of the summer in 2017, renovation work was being carried out then and was a little surprised to find it was still on going. Air con still not working in the rooms with little control of the heating so the rooms can get rather warm. Rooms themselves were comfortable, clean and staff were very friendly and helpful. My only concern was the fact I phoned this hotel twice once to try and get a gift receipt. I was informed someone would get back to me within the day, this was in November and I'm still waiting. Made a further call 3 days before going to the hotel to ensure I had the room required. Was unable to get the hotel and was diverted to another within the group, details were taken and was informed someone would call me back in 10 minutes guess what I'm still waiting for that call. Thankfully I got everything sorted on arrival. But Hiltons customer services could do with a review and don't make promises you have no intention of keeping!",4,2018,01,21
228,So much more than just a 3 star hotel,"After an awful stay at the doubletree kensington in London, i tried the garden inn in Dublin and i was pleasantly surprised.

Check in was smooth and got a room on the first floor. It was refurbished and perfect size. The construction didn’t bother us at all.

Breakfast buffet was better than many 4 stars i’ve been too.

The airport bus stops in front of the hotel and you’re 10minutes walking to central Dublin.

This hotel is a great deal and i would say it’s even a 4 star!",5,2018,01,19
228,Great hotel! ,"Had a lovely stay at the Hilton. Friendly reception and bar staff. 
Having building work during our stay, which I was worried about but they didn't start work until late and didn't bother my friend and I. 
We had a brand new room which was fabulous! We had 2 double beds, big bathroom, lots of storage space in the room & tea making facilities. Perfect! 
The room was lovely. Clean, comfortable and perfect! 
Good location. 10 minute walk to the town centre and to temple bar area. 
Would definitely stay again! 

*If your staying for new year.. right next door (about 4 minute walk - to the end of the road basically) the custom house put on a massive event. We didn't manage to get tickets as too late but it look incredible! ",5,2018,01,17
228,Nice hotel ,The hotel was lovely. The staff have been helpful. The food in the restaurant is good. The beds are comfortable and offer all the amenities. It’s a good location too. I recommend it and would stay there again. ,5,2018,01,16
228,Helpful and Kind Beyond Words,"We arrived at the Hilton Garden Inn minus our stowed luggage (stay away from Aer Lingus!) and a forgotten piece of hand luggage left on the shuttle from the airport.  And then I got caught in a drenching downpour with no change of clothes.  Our disaster was eased only by the kindness of Sole and two others on the front desk.  It's a very long story, but they insured that we had as much help as they could give along with a large dose of human kindness and caring words...and even a hug.  The hotel is in a great location (e.g. could walk to Trinity College), was undergoing renovation, but still very clean and very comfortable.  I would easily stay there again.  Restaurant was just great for dinner and breakfast.",5,2018,01,16
228,great,"great hotel, great location, great staff, great breakfast, great value for money. we were travelling as a party of 8 friends and they let us check in early and the staff were friendly and the lunch was excellent and the breakfast",5,2018,01,16
228,Massive Construction Ongoing,"Check ongoing  building works here.  Massive development ongoing extension stsrting early morning with cranes, lifts, hammering etc.

No problem if i had been made fully aware of the issue before arriving 
as i would simply have booked elsewhere!",3,2018,01,15
228,Decent overall - wait for construction to be finished before booking!,"Good location for sightseeing in Dublin - walkable to city centre and right off bus lines (super convenient to/from DUB airport)  Currently under construction, which was scheduled to be completed in DEC 2017 - the noise and mess from that are very disruptive - and work starts EARLY in the morning.   Staff and management really good overall - just a few unfriendly staff at check-in.  Rooms are well-appointed, but small by US standards (though on par for Europe).  Comfy beds, relatively quiet (apart from construction) slightly odd bathroom configuration makes it feel smaller than it is.  Restaurant priced about 150% of surrounding market rates.",4,2018,01,08
228,Another Great Hilton,"Stayed here for four nights in late Nov 2017.  Reservation was made on hotel website without any difficulties, and we were warned the building was undergoing renovations.  We arrived early and left our suitcases for a few hours.  Later in the day - around 1300, our room was ready - very nice, clean, and facing south toward the river.  Everything worked fine, WI-FI and television reception was good.  Construction was getting a little loud - more than we expected.  Discussed with the management who agreed the noise directly above our room was excessive - and they treated us to dinner at the restaurant as a compensation.  More than adequate for the minor inconvenience  - the noise stopped at 1700.  The location of this hotel is great - the 757 airport shuttle bus stops directly in front of the hotel (south-side) while the streetcar/light-rail stops directly behind the hotel on the north side.  The old town area (Temple Bar) is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Breakfast was delicious, and the Guinness at the bar was as fresh as I hoped.  All of the staff I met were friendly, knowledgeable and conversant.  I highly recommend this facility to others",5,2018,01,07
228,Disappointing stay,"If you want to spend any time in your room or sleep past 8am please avoid this place until construction is complete. We feel a bit cheated having booked and paid the €170 (family room b&b)in full 3 weeks before our stay and there wasnt a single mention of disruptive heavy construction at the hotel!3 days before our stay I received a confirmation email that mentioned the work!I understand that the addition of 85 new rooms and the modernisation of the existing rooms is necessary and from what we could see,done to a really high standard. But it is unfair to charge full price and not tell the customer that they will be sleeping on a building site! The hotel is superbly located to the city and will be beautiful when complete,our own family bedroom was fantastically decorated,modern and spacious but unfortunately like a sauna due to air conditioning not working properly despite s note in the room saying it was newly fitted!!The food at Oly's was tasty and reasonably priced but not much options for kids other. Costa coffee onsite is a great addition but unfortunately I dont think I have ever been served by such a ruder person who dighed and rolled her eyes at me when I ordered two large coffees after dinner. Charging €2 for a tiny jug of tsp water and a splash of cordial for the kids at dinner is also a bit extreme! Beware of the hidden costs...€18 to park the car overnight in a separate car park behind the hotel. My final negative comment relates to breakfast. The kids were further disappointed to find there were no pancakes, i did ask the idle omlette chef who said no and apologised, the waffle station was also out of order which was a real let down especially for the kids. The hot food was poorly replenished and ran out of hash browns and this was only 8:30! Not 4 star by any means. We did leave very disappointed but I do want to finish on a positive note. The Hilton is currently doing some serious renovation work and it will be superb I have no doubt but I would ssy to avoid until works are complete. The location is fantastic and only a short walk to O'Connell street and other areas of the city. The refurbished family rooms are a great layout,spacious, super clean and really modern with a lovely bathroom too and modern Samsung TV too. The staff at reception are friendly and efficient too. In its current state I would not recommend this hotel for a family stay, for this kind of money book a hotel that is not a building site.",2,2018,01,06
228,"Smashing staff, clean, bright hotel","The hotel doesn't look pretty on the outside, not like many in Dublin, but the staff is friendly, warm and helpful. Service is top notch. The rooms are average hotel rooms, but clean, and new.  The restaurant is what you would expect at the hotel. The fitness room is well maintained, the laundry room is too, and convenient. An easy 20-30 minute walk to all major tourist attractions, and the walks are easy. A Tesco Express is twelve minutes away,  right at the edge of Temple Bar. Grafton street another five. You are right on the river Liffy, and their are two cinemas within a 20 minute walk. We were there for six nights during Christmas 2017 with a 13 and a 10 year old. The service and location are excellent. The facility, overall, above average.",4,2018,01,02
228,The Scaffolding view was incredible!,"I’m tough on my reviews yet a supporter of Hilton brand. In this regard the Dublin Hilton Garden Inn is centrally located if you want to be in town. However, the building is covered in scaffolding and I’m not sure that was disclosed. Spending time negotiating on a view is a waste since you’ll get a nice thick wood scaffolding view right out your window unless you want to bend down to see the water. We moved to a different room and were lucky enough not to have it.  Check in was average at best since it appeared the lady there was overwhelmed with two people waiting. It’s a typical European hotel with tiny rooms but is very clean and presentable. A good business stop over for sure but not the purpose of our trip. ",3,2018,01,01
228,great family hotel,Excellent location close to city center. Airport stops right n front hotel. Excellent restaurant/bar on site. The hotel was undergoing renovations but did not bother us. Staff was friendly and very accommodating.,4,2017,12,31
228,"Modern, comfy luxurious","The renovations are so new they were still going on when we stayed. Everything you’d expect from a Hilton. Nice sized room, shower that made sense to an American, lots of outlets, conveniently placed.
Had dinner in the attached restaurant (fish and chips) and thought it was very good. Service was a bit slow, but it was a Friday evening and the adjoining bar was very busy.",4,2017,12,29
228,Great Location,"Great location for getting around Dublin. Steps from EPIC Museum (highly recommend). Easy walking distance to 3Arena. Great staff, clean rooms. Downside is ongoing construction which hotel does make every effort to be non-disruptive to guests. ",5,2017,12,25
228,Loud,"It’s fine and clean. Suitable for a quick overnight. Very loud. All night. Especially loud when people shower...banging noise. And staff isn’t super nice. It would be fine for a cheap hotel, except this place isn’t cheap. I expect more from the Hilton brand. FYI: No water in room. Be prepared. No slippers or robes either. We asked for a toothbrush and they told us where we could buy them...with a condescending look. ",2,2017,12,24
228,Disappointing ,"Stayed here for 2 nights on Christmas week. The room rate was good value and the room itself was clean, modern and comfortable. Myself and my partner were attending a concert in the 3 arena. We went to the hotel restaurant for food before the gig. We made sure to leave ourselves plenty of time to enjoy dinner before leaving for the concert. We ordered 2 burgers and over 50minutes later there was no sign of dinner. We Had a word with the manager Gosia who was pleasant and offered us pizza after the gig to compensate. We decided to cancel the food order as we didn’t have time, nor did we avail of the pizza as we were feeling annoyed over the whole situation. We had to rush to the gig and get a hot dog on the way- annoying when we had booked the hotel and went for a meal here with the view of having a relaxing evening. The second night we went for a drink in the bar my partner ordered brandy and they had none... Subsequently I went to order a mulled wine as advertised at the bar and the Barman informed me they had none. No further explanation was given as to why. 
A disappointing trip which we were really looking forward to- rarely would complain but waiting an hour for 2 meals when the place wasn’t that busy seems a bit ridiculous. Won’t be rushing back! ",3,2017,12,23
228,FANTASTIC BAR MANAGER,"HI, I meant to do this last week, but stayed in the hotel on 16Dec as we were going to a show in the 3 arena, and we came across a fantastic barman called Stuart I believe, who may be the Bar Manager. This guy could not do enough for us and our friends and in all the years staying in hotels all over, he stood out by a mile. Would definitely stay again, he is a credit to your hotel, well done Stuart, it felt like our local! Great hotel, fantastic service from check in to check out! Happy Christmas all! Regards Darach Boylan",5,2017,12,23
228,"Good price for the city, a bit on the edge of the action","I traveled to Ireland for Champions Weekend and found this reasonably priced Hilton property.  It is not within walking distance of some of the very popular sites, but the Luas is only a block away and I used this quite easily.  In fact, the Luas will take you to Hueston Station for longer train rides (which I also used).  The property was under major renovation when I was there in September 2017 (I believe the facade and also air conditioning installation).  I had a bit of a problem with the lobby business center, the equipment was very outdated.  I did utilize room service and the food was delicious and arrived quickly. Taxis are very easy to grab so you should have no issue getting anywhere you wish to in the city.  I also was easily transported back to the airport.",4,2017,12,23
228,A Decent Stay,"We only stayed in the hotel for one night to enjoy a night out in Dublin but found the overall experience more than adequate.  The front of house staff at both check in and check out were extremely efficient and pleasant and explained about the building works currently ongoing and were also most helpful in ordering taxis.  I also had occasion to telephone the hotel the day before with a query and was delighted to be dealt with by an exceptionally well informed and friendly gentleman which also makes a good first impression of the level of service offered by the staff.  

The room itself was absolutely fine although a bit poky given that there were two beds in it which would not have been my preference but that was all the availability on the given day.  The most important aspects of cleanliness and comfort were well met.  The room had a small tray with tea and coffee making facilities (a couple of biscuits on the tray wouldn't have gone astray!) and the TV and hairdryer were both great.  The construction work was not intrusive and in the main the hotel was lovely and quiet.  We had a drink in the bar and as you would expect prices were eye wateringly high (not unusual) but we did not have the time to avail of the breakfast the following morning although we were told that there is a small price reduction if you book the breakfast the night before.  For a Friday in the run up to Christmas I have to say the room rate was pretty acceptable and overall it was a good choice of hotel in a really handy location.",4,2017,12,20
228,"Clean, comfortable, good staff and fairly quiet","The HGI is located on the canal and near the train and bus stops.  If you happen to be facing the canal you will slightly hear the train when it passes, if you opt for the back section of the hotel its very quiet.

Its a full service hotel including banquet services and meeting rooms, has a a workout area and restaurant, so for business you have everything you need to start and end your day.

Its close enough to shopping to walk, is near a few pubs and restaurants and is well serviced by taxis which always seem to be at the ready.

The staff was very pleasant and well informed.  

I don't give out 5's unless there is that ""something extra"".  There was nothing wrong with the HGI,in fact all good..""good"".  A good hotel at a fair price, nothing ""WOW"".  So its a very strong 4.",4,2017,12,18
228,A conference made confortable,"The accomodation was a significant part of the conference success: to keep participants working (internet connection, PCs and printers at the lobby, and room for discussion); a walking distance from Trinity college; a walking distance from shopping and pubs/restaurants. But prices are too high in Ireland.",5,2017,12,18
228,Festive Trip to Dublin,Hotel was very good staff very helpful and we had a great time. Good location and everything you need there in the hotel. Only negative was the hotel just need to be clear with accessible room availability as we requested back in April but were not given an accessible room on our visit in December.,4,2017,12,18
228,friendly welcome to dublin,the hotel was undergoing refurbishments but despite the building work the stay was faultless and the staff were very friendly. The porridge  and brown bread at breakfast were real surprises. The bar staff were polite and keen to be of service which made staying in for dinner a good option,5,2017,12,18
228,"Good Hotel, As expected","Stayed here for one evening while in Dublin.  Hotel staff were friendly and check in/out very smooth. Room felt cosy'ish - but was clean and well appointed.  10/10 for the power sockets with built in USB by the desk and bed.  

Breakfast the following morning was well set up and no issues in getting a table etc.

Would recommend and go back again.",4,2017,12,17
228,For a good nights sleep,"Located in an area far enough away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to all the main attractions including Temple Bar. Reasonably priced and good rooms. Bed was extremely comfortable. 
The room was well equipped including safe, iron and ironing board. Fridge also provided.

Construction work was being undertaken but nothing happening on the day I stayed. The hotel made the point of advising of this activity and apologising for any inconvenience.

Check in was excellent and we were given access to our rooms at 11am. Not a guarantee this would be the norm!!

Friendly staff, happy to help. Overall a good place to stay. 
",4,2017,12,10
228,FEELING COLD,"Having stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions when it was Jury's, I would not consider staying again in December unless they increased the heating.  It would be nice to have more heating in the room.  The corridors on the evening were very cold",4,2017,12,07
228,Business trip ,"A great hotel at a good location a short distance away from city centre. Nice clean rooms. Excellent for business or pleasure stay. The room got all you need. Quite and pleasant stay. Well recommended. 
",4,2017,12,05
228,Great hotel,A great hotel that will be much better when the building works are complete. Good location a 10 minute walk to temple bar area.The breakfast is very good with a great selection of both hot and cold food. Just a slight shame that there is building work going on.,4,2017,12,04
228,Lovely hotel central location ,"We stayed at this hotel this weekend as a trip with friends. Lovely clean and big hotel 

We stayed in a room in 1st floor and it was large and spotless clean.  In the room there are USB ports which is ideal! Some toiletries in the bathroom too.  The shower was great super powerful and the bed comfortable 

The lobby was large and lots of seating. We had coffee from the on site Costa. There’s also a mini shop area with water, snacks and toiletries also ice cream. 

Only downside is the hotel is under construction just now so full of scaffolding but we weren’t disrupted. 

The airport transfer bus stops directly outside the hotel which was handy ",4,2017,12,04
228,"Generally OK, But Intrusive Refurb","The hotel is being refurbished and extended at the moment. According to information left in the room, work commences at 09:00 daily. Sadly it commenced around 07:30 the morning I was there, which I think was unacceptable.

I mentioned this at Reception when I was checking out and was immediately offered ""breakfast on us"" which wasn't particularly helpful as I was on my way to a meeting. It also suggested that this wasn't the first time someone had complained. I have no problem with a refurb but 07:30 is too early for most guests.

Otherwise the hotel was fine - the room was very nice, presumably because of the refurb. I'd stay again, but not until the refurb is finished.",3,2017,12,01
228,Great for a business trip,"Had the pleasure to stay here one night on a business trip.
Good location, being close to the water and city center.
Lots of options for food and drinks near by.
Hotel was under renovation but not something that was noticed in a bigger way.
Room was OK in size and standard.
Very thin doors and noise from corridor was easily heard and disturbing.
Nice breakfast with good selection.",4,2017,11,28
228,"Hilton Garden Inn, Custom Dublin","Our stay was for a total of 10 nights.  During that time, we couldn't have asked for better treatment.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  There was a great variety of breakfast options.  The rooms were clean with comfortable beds.  Great bar service.  Would highly recommend.",5,2017,11,28
228,Great Option in Dublin right on the River Liffey,"Everything at the hotel was done professionally and with friendliness.  The staff pays attention to details.  The breakfast is great, and the bar area is fun and inviting (in addition to having a great staff).  It's a reaasonable walk to many of the things to do in Dublin, and there are many options for dining and drinks nearby.",5,2017,11,28
228,Do not stay here until building work done!,"We stayed two night at this hotel and were not prepared for the enormous noise issues due to building work. The hotel website said ""minimal"" disruption between 9am - 6.30pm. Instead we were abruptly woken up at 8am both days (trying to have a lie in as on holiday with no kids) with incessant drilling vibrating our room. It was so loud we couldn't even have a conversation in the room. 
The hotel staff were very sorry and said the builders didn't always stick to the rules but frankly this hotel should not be open while such loud and disruptive work goes on.It is unfair to charge people to stay in such disturbance. Numerous people complained and were given free breakfast tokens but this didn't make up for endless noise before we left and again when we got back to our room. 
Positives - very comfy bed. Lovely river view. Very clean. Friendly staff. 
It was a longer walk to city centre than expected - a good 20 minutes. 
Really unhappy I picked a hotel which was far from peaceful for my rare break away. ",1,2017,11,27
228,Don’t Expect Romance,"My new husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. To be fair, the hotel is nice. It is currently under a lot of construction, so there is scaffolding and paint buckets everywhere. I had previously read reviews about the remodeling, so I was prepared for that. 

We were also pleasantly surprised that we could check in early after a very long flight from Orlando. 

What I wasn’t pleasantly surprised about is the fact that I can hear EVERYTHING said or done by my neighbors in the next room. We spent the first two nights of our stay listening to a screaming child, which really doesn’t set the tone for a romantic getaway. I’m currently listening to two women discuss their plans for the day while blow drying their hair. You can hear full blown conversations. If the hotel is spending money on a remodel, they should really invest in some better insulation.

The food at Oly’s at the hotel is okay. Get the Caesar salad because it is probably the best thing on the menu. They have a pretty decent beer selection too. 

The hotel is also an easy walking distance for most of the important sight-seeing spots. You might want to find transportation for the Guinness Storehouse if you aren’t a big walker. It was a bit of a hike. 

If I were to do the trip over, I would pick somewhere else. The crying child was a big turn-off. ",3,2017,11,27
228,Dinner in The Hilton Garden Inn.,"I was here for a group event and we had dinner afterward. The hotel is comfortable, the staff are friendly and helpful and the location is convenient. The room we had for our business meeting was a bit cluttered with large tables and it was difficult to move around. The dinner was budget priced three course. I had soup to start and it was nothing better than ok. For my main course I choose the slow cooked steak. It came in gravy and sitting on mashed potatoes. The steak was stringy and not very appetising. I was expecting vegetables to follow, but they never came. It seems that this was all there was. The dessert was a very nice pecan pie.  The overall experience of the dinner was not good and the service was slow.",3,2017,11,26
228,Great location & Hotel,"Staff very helpful and friendly, hotel and rooms spotless, Breakfast was excellent great choice of food from cooked food to continental to waffle station and freshly cooked omelets to you choice. When staff were asked to replenish food it was completed quickly and without any fuss. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,11,21
228,Enjoyable stay in a refurbished room,"Stayed 3 nights here in a king river view room. As a diamond member I was upgraded to this room from a twin room. The room had been updated with air conditioning. Bathroom is on the small size with a combination tub/shower. Included in the room as a small refrigerator. 

It was convenient to the O’Connell area and just a few blocks to the Grafton Street and Temple Bar area. The hop on bus stopped right in front of the hotel.

Breakfast included made to order eggs and a large variety of items on the buffet. Breads are so good in Ireland I wish they was more types offered. The brown soda bread was very good as well as the house made croissants and pastries. 

One area for improvement is to either add a concierge or train the front desk staff so they are more familiar with areas surrounding Dublin. An example is the day trip I planned to Kilkenny. I was Trying to find a local trip to Kilkenny but all the trips included Wicklow. I ask at the desk for help and they were not aware of any tours just going there.  Then when I asked for help with local transportation to get there they were not very familiar with how to do this. ",4,2017,11,19
228,One night near the very centre of Dublin,"Stayed one night in one one of the bigger rooms. As usual with Hilton the hotel is well maintained with modern lobby and rooms. Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. Only thing that was a little annoying was the car park which is round the corner. No big issue but the hotel is under renovation, so the pavement was filled scaffolding (which was neatly covered by the way). Within walking distance from Temple Bar area. Breakfast was very much on the the better side. Will choose again next time in Dublin.  ",4,2017,11,19
228,Excellent hotel with a fantastic location,"Stayed for about 4 nights in the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House, and found it very comfortable. Rooms are spacious with big double beds. Location is spot on, about 10 mns walking distance to O'Connell Street and about 20 mns walking distance to Grafton Street. Good hot shower provided. The fastest check in i have ever experienced ! Also reception staff were very helpful. Breakfast was delicious and i could not get over their hash browns. Had a truly fantastic stay in this Hilton property!",5,2017,11,17
228,Stay nov 2017,"Hotel is well located, rooms are clean and the service very good.  There is however a lot of noise form neighbouring rooms.  They were working on the airco and so the room was warm, there was no opportunity to open the window.",4,2017,11,17
228,Too expensive,€224 for a room for one night without breakfast is too expensive. This apparently was the cheapest room available when we booked a few months ago. We stayed here when it was Jurys and were very happy but there have been changes.  The reception staff were polite but not particularly welcoming or friendly.  The room was very nice however.  We would not stay here again.,2,2017,11,16
228,Good location,"In a good location and nicely furnished. The room was great, decent shower and comfy bed. I was disappointed to find no hot chocolate on the tea tray as I do love a hot chocolate before bed! 
Had dinner in Oly's and the food was okay, not a lot of choice, I wish I had been less tired so I could venture out but it sufficed. The breakfast was delicious and there was lots of choice, including hot chocolate! :) 
Only other small issue was the building work, there was a note in the room saying the majority of the noise would be between 9am-6:30pm but I was woken up by loud drilling and banging around 8am but I had to be up anyway so it was a different kind of alarm clock. If you're looking to lay in, perhaps request a lower floor.
I would stay here again though, staff were friendly and welcoming!",4,2017,11,16
228,"Nice Stay, Efficient Hotel","I could not get into Jury's Inn for the full Dublin stay, so opted for Hilton Garden Inn on the river for one night. Very close to the tram line from Heuston Station, so an easy walk with a roll-on and hand luggage.  And although slightly to the east of the center of the city, it was but maybe a five to ten minute walk to the tourist areas.  And next door to the new immigration museum (which is quite impressive).

Public spaces and room were quite nice.  Modern.  Comfy in a 3-star, corporate sort of way.  Quiet.  Super efficient check in.  Friendly front desk staff.  I forget the rate I paid -- maybe USD150 a night -- but seemed worth the price.      

Full Irish breakfast was very good.  Filling, which is good for a day of on-your-feet sight seeing.  

 I give the hotel  five stars.  Exactly what I would expect in this class of hotel.  And, one of my criteria for quality, no surprises, no hidden fees and charges, no hassles.",5,2017,11,15
228,Great location and service,"We stayed here for 2 nights on a weekend. At check-in the staff were friendly and helpful.  Our room was a good size with a queen bed. There was an easy chair and desk, fridge, iron & board, hairdryer and bath as well as a shower in the bathroom.  It was furnished in a contemporary style and quiet and there was a safe for your valuables. There was a good choice at breakfast but we did not eat there at any other time during our stay. Car parking is available. Building work was going on but we did not find it intrusive. It is situated right on the quayside making it very accessible for most of the city centre attractions.",5,2017,11,14
228,"Except for the construction, it would have been great.","We got in at 9 in the morning. The desk held our bags for us and suggested the tram that runs right behind the hotel to get us around town. We came back later and checked in hoping for a few winks as a crying child had kept us awake all night on the plane. The construction involved core drilling so sleep was not easily had. The room was great with all sorts of modern amenities with USB ports everywhere. The restaurant, Oly's, has a really good solid brunch, not with exotic foods, but with fresh waffles or omelettes, etc. We did have a dessert one evening and that was fancy and good.",4,2017,11,14
228,Perfect for a 3 night break,"Friendly staff, clean, comfortable room and well maintained, pleasant public areas. It's also in a great location overlooking the river on the north side and in easy walking distance (10-15 min) to attractions such as Temple Bar, Grafton Street etc. The Airlink bus stops right outside the hotel (route 757; route 747 stops around the corner in Common Street) and it's a quick 20 min journey to/ from the airport. The hop on/ off bus stops right outside the hotel; we purchased a combo Airlink and hop on/ off ticket for €27 each which included the return airport trip and 48 hours on the (green) hop on and off service.
We were allocated one of the refurbished rooms on the 2nd floor, with air conditioning/ climate control installed and although as others have said, there is work going on and scaffolding outside, we weren't really disturbed by any noise, other than an adjacent room having some work done, when we popped back for an afternoon rest. Our room was on the corner of the hotel on the Common Street side of the hotel, well away from the work compound, where the builders were situated. We had a side view looking down the river, nice! Our room rate included breakfast (€14 euros otherwise) which was very good. Self-serve, buffet style, with an excellent and wide range of hot and cold foods. It was a great way to start the day. Our room had two doubles (one for our teenager), nice private bathroom with bath and shower and some good quality toiletries - nice touch.
We also ate in the hotel restaurant one night (Olly's) as after a busy day in Dublin we decided we couldn't walk another step. The food was very good and the service brilliant, attentive, friendly but not too much in your face. It was €74 including a bottle of wine for main courses and a shared starter for 3 people, so not outrageous, price-wise. Bar staff were also friendly and provided good service, but the prices as you might expect for a city location, weren't cheap e.g. pint of Guinness €5.45.
We enjoyed our stay here and would happily return and can recommend to others.",5,2017,11,06
228,"Friendly, Helpful Staff; Pleasant Hotel Even During Remodeling","I would recommend this hotel to first time visitors to Dublin.  It is located on the north side of the river with an airport bus (Airlink 747) stop right outside the door.  Had we known this, we would have taken the bus instead a cab and saved some money.  There is a pedestrian bridge not far from the hotel that gets you over the river.  With a few minutes of pleasant walking, you can be on the campus of Trinity College and visit the Book of Kells.  O'Connell Street (the best place to pick up the Hop On and Hop Off bus in that part of town) is a nice walk from the hotel.  The staff was wonderful!  We arrived, about 9 AM and stored our luggage with them so that we could see as much of Dublin as possible that day.  I asked for a quiet room.  We were put in the back of the hotel.  It was not noisy except for some doors opening and closing between 11:30 and 1:00AM. The room was clean and comfortable.  The restaurant, in the lobby, provided an adequate dinner for two weary tourists.  We did not have the buffet breakfast the next morning, but got scones and coffee from the restaurant.  We were there only one night.",5,2017,11,05
228,Family short stay,Lovely hotel. Refurbished rooms are very contemporary and clean. The breakfast experience was wonderful- lots of different foods on offer and the children ate complimentary. We also had a lovely dinner in the hotel. Parking was easy and the hotel was child friendly.,5,2017,11,04
228,2017 Dublin Marathon Convenientally located hotel. Hotel," My fellow runners this hotel was located blocks from the start and finish line of the race. DART train a 5 min walk away to attend the EXPO. This place treated my wife and I like family all 5 days of our stay. ",4,2017,11,02
228,3 night  city break,"Booked the hotel as we wanted it to be central which it is 5 mins walk to the heart of Dublin. 
The room was good size, clean and well appointed. The TV reception not good at times. 
Be aware if driving a good car park is very local but is £12 for 24 hours
Great view over the river. 
Breakfast was lovely, loads of choice and nothing too much trouble. 
",4,2017,11,02
228,Great place to end Ireland trip!,I had just completed 6 nites at 4 hotels in other parts of the country on a group tour. I had 2 extra nites to stay in the city. I had a lovely view of the River Liffey from my room. This hotel was walkable from the Luas rail and other transport. An express bus to the airport stops right outside for 7euro. Front desk staff was helpful directing me to the right bus to meet family in Stillorgan. Bed was very comfortable and everything seemed very new including large towels and washcloths. There was very complete fitness center and business center. There is a pedestrian bridge to the city center right outside the hotel. Keep in mind that construction on the hotel did start at about 8:15am even on a Saturday but will be even better on my next visit!,5,2017,11,01
228,Great value and Great place,"I stayed for 4 nights in Hilton Garden Inn in Dublin. The location is perfect, Dublin is already a small city but when you stay in a hotel in the city center like Hilton Garden Inn you find yourself close to everything (Everywhere is almost 10-20 minutes walking).
The hotel is great, very clean, breakfast is so good with a lot of varieties. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is clean and big. I did not like that they kept no bottles of water in the room or the mini bar, so every time you need water you have to go to the reception and buy bottles of water and snacks from there, it saves you money but most hotels keep water in the rooms for free. Also room service is a bit expensive, They charge 5 euros for any order to your room. The administration of the hotel was very kind to me, I wanted to extend one night and the rates have come up but they were nice enough to keep my original rates which was around 35 euros less. Also the staff is very helpful and friendly.

I would recommend Hilton Garden Inn for anyone visiting Dublin and wants to go around the city.",4,2017,10,31
228,Great Hotel (but be Aware of the Current Construction),"I am mixed about how to write this review.  In general, this was a great hotel – excellent location (for me), clean and decently sized rooms, tremendously friendly & helpful staff, etc, etc.  The hotel restaurant was adequate, bar/lounge was fine and room service was quick & good.  The price was right – I might even say a bargain for the quality and room size. In most ways, it is the quality I come to expect with the ‘Hilton’ name attached.   In a normal hotel review, my only complaint would be that the shower’s water pressure was just a little too little!
However, as a TA contributor, I feel compelled to add one thing.  I would suggest avoiding this property until they have completed their renovations.  The rooms have no HVAC and the heat is via radiator (and I believe updating this is part of the work being done as well as adding some rooms to the property).  The hotel does adequately advise on its website that there may be issues with noise during work hours, and they generally kept to these hours.  Unfortunately, there is also a significant amount of construction being done to neighboring properties.  They do not limit their work to the hotel’s posted hours (and I am well aware that the hotel has no control of this).  But, since there currently is no HVAC, the only way to cool your room is via opened window (note that there was a much-appreciated fan in my room), this exterior noise at times a huge nuisance. Normally, I’d have considered myself lucky to be in Dublin during a warm spell in October. But due to this, my window was opened most of the time -- so from 6:30 to sometimes as late as 19:30 I had to endure the clamor from the local construction. Maybe it was worse for me as I am fairly sure my room was on the backside of the hotel on the 4th floor (the upper floor didn’t help much with nose reduction).
In conclusion, consider this property as it is a nice place at a reasonable price.  However, be especially aware of the progress of their renovations when making the choice to stay there.",4,2017,10,29
228,Excellent Hotel ,"I stayed at this hotel with my husband on Friday October 27th as we were attending a concert in the 3 Arena.

The hotel is in the middle of renovations, however, the building work takes place during the day and the hotel staff are managing the process excellently so we had absolutely no problems in this regard.

Our room was lovely, clean and comfortable. Every member of staff we met from housekeeping to management was extremely polite and welcoming.

We had lunch in the bar after checking in. We had a lovely menu to choose from and what was presented exceeded our expectations in both taste and value.

Breakfast the next morning was one of the nicest that I have had in a hotel in a long time. A great spread of food for all tastes. My husband particularly liked the pancake station.

I must give a special mention to the gentleman working in the bar late into the night on Friday night/Saturday night. He couldn't do half enough for us after we arrived back to the hotel and I am particularly grateful for the pot of tea :-)

Well done to all and we look forward to returning again in the near future. ",5,2017,10,28
228,Location was really good,"We stayed here recently for a 2 day stop over in Dublin.  The airport express bus stops right in front of the hotel so it is very easily accessible to and from the airport.  The area in the evening was quiet so not much street noise to disturb your sleep.  The Emigration museum  is almost right next door and the hotel is walking distance to all things Dublin.  The city is great for walking with lots to see that wandering our way to the Guinness Storehouse was easy and easy enough. So location would be a 10 out of 10

They were renovating the building during our time so the air conditioning/heating system was not controllable.  Some guests were cold so the heat was turned on while our room was very hot, not to the point that it was uncomfortable but perhaps slightly annoying.  Dublin was having an unseasonably warm fall.  Other than that, hotel staff were great.  We would recommend this hotel and would stay here again if the opportunity presents itself.",4,2017,10,28
228,Lovely hotel in a brilliant location,"We stayed her for the night this week as a family and booked a twin bedded room for the three of us. We arrived early morning after our flight and although our room wasn't ready, we were allowed to leave our luggage and go exploring Dublin. After checking in, we found out that our room had been changed (from one at the back of the hotel, to one at the side of the hotel with a view of the Liffey). We had one of the newly refurbished rooms and it was very smart. The room did seem a little small due to there being two double beds in it, however for one night it was perfect. The beds were very comfy and we all had a fantastic sleep, that was after a pint of Guinness in the bar.

We were all impressed with the breakfast, with our 12 year old loving the waffle maker. There was lots to choose from and the homemade scones were lovely. 

I would recommend this hotel as the location is brilliant. Although in the business district, it feels close enough to the centre of Dublin, without there being all the noise. It is perfectly located on the 747/757 bus route from the airport.",5,2017,10,27
228,Great location,"The hotel is right on the canal in the downtown area, walkable to the main tourist areas. It has all the amenities of a standard Garden Inn, which is great. Room was reasonably large for a European room. The downside was that they were doing construction at the hotel, and that woke me up when I really needed the sleep. The manager more than made up for it with a room discount and covering my taxi to the airport, which was much more than what I would have expected. Highly recommended.",5,2017,10,25
228,Standard soulless fayre ,"Stayed for one night over the weekend whilst at a concert in Dublin.  Was overpriced considering the room rate didn’t include breakfast. Hotel itself is clean and easy on the eye, the refurb not helping but thankfully no-one was working over the weekend.  Rooms comfy and generally ok, nothing special. An overpriced hotel geared towards the business-folk in town, not ideal for a weekend visit in my opinion.
",3,2017,10,25
228,Great place to stay,We had a lovely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. They very kindly let us into our room very early which was great. All the staff were helpful and friendly. The room was large and the bed and pillows are very comfortable. Although there is building work going on at the moment it did not impinge on our stay there. The food is really good too.,4,2017,10,24
228,Midst of remodelling and noisy,"I stayed here for 3 nights. When I arrived the noise was very loud. Front desk was very polite and efficient however and my room was ready. They did warn me it would be noisy. Luckily though my room was far enough away from the noise I was able to nap that day and sleep each night. There is no air conditioning though (or heat that I could find) but fortunately it was nice enough in the room. I understand that is one of the improvement to come.
Only one elevator was working but they were fairly fast so it wasn't much of an inconvenience. The Oly bar has a great breakfast and of course, bar for later. Overall very pleasant stay despite the construction",4,2017,10,23
228,"great hotel and location, noise is a problem 8am - 6pm","Hotel and staff were great. The staff are very accommodating and courteous. The room was well specified. The AC was not adjustable, it was too hot when we came in on the first day. They are adding two floors and building starts at 8am and stops at 6pm. Not a problem if you are out all day like I was, but if you bring a family member as I did then it makes for an unpleasant stay for them.",3,2017,10,22
228,Being remodeled to improve,"Since we were coming into Ireland and going to our first destination before staying in Dublin, we wanted on leaving to be located close the the Irish Ferry terminal. Even though it is in downtown Dublin, it was in a very nice area. The room was very nice with plenty of room. We had access to wi-fi and many good restaurants in the area. They have a very nice business center if you need to use a computer. We used our ipad while in the room but I also needed to have access to a computer for my WoW word postings. It worked very well for what we needed.",5,2017,10,21
228,Wonderful breakfast,"This will be a fantastic hotel when the repairs are all done. Very clean, great breakfast. Wonderful front desk service. The rooms and bathrooms are small but again, clean and comfortable. They had my room ready early and let us check in. We walked from Connolly station. There are buses stopping right out front.",4,2017,10,19
228,"Bland, chain hotel, lacks character","Seems like staff are operating on auto-pilot. Same old routine day in, day out for them. Feel sorry for them! Room clean, but breakfast at €14 a head to help yourself etc is a bit pricey. Overall a good location but at the end of the day it's a chain hotel with a chain atmosphere.",3,2017,10,19
228,Enjoyed our stay,"The room had everything we needed, the breakfast was to a good standard and staff were polite. We asked to change our room for one at the back of the building and higher up and they were able to sort this out with us no hassle.",5,2017,10,19
228,Overpriced,"We stayed here last New Years Eve - yes I know NYE is an expensive time of year but I've priced it on other occasions and it wasn't dramatically different.We basically just used it as somewhere to lay our heads for a few hours and it met those needs. Nothing special, nothing different. As far as I'm concerned some budget hotels have nicer rooms than this and it's at the top end of the pricing scale.",3,2017,10,17
228,Very friendly staff,"Hotel staff particularly in the Restaurant treated us very well
Restaurant Manager Agnes /Sushil / Prakash Ram / Chilar and Priscilla made it happened.
They were very kind friendly and pleasent which made our stay very enjoyable,
We will definitely come back because of them.",4,2017,10,17
228,Good Hotel With an Unfortunate Arrival Experience,"I visited this hotel a year ago shortly after it opened and was very impressed.  However this visit left me very disappointed with a bad arrival experience.  We arrived by car, to find the unloading zone at the front of the hotel occupied by cars so we drove around to the hotel car park in the next block.  Unfortunately, construction is blocking the connection from the car park to the hotel so we had to schlepp our luggage out several blocks on the public sidewalk through large crowds of tourists. The front desk staff apologized for the construction, and the full-of-cars arrival area, ""sorry, nothing we can do about that.""   2 hours after checking in we went out for a walk and noticed the very same cars, parked in the same ""unloading only"" spaces.  You would think that with the car park walkway difficulties the staff would take extra care to keep the arrival zone clear of squatting cars, but no, the staff seemed not to care.

The rest of the stay went well and the lobby, room and staff were all efficient and helpful.  But alas, the arrival experience was so poor that it overshadowed our brief stay.  

What could the staff have done to improve?  First, add a warning about the parking difficulties to the already-present construction warning, and Second, enforce the ""no parking, Loading/Unloading Only"" so arriving guests have a hope of finding a spot to unload luggage.

No sure we will chance a return visit until all construction is complete.",3,2017,10,15
228,Hotel will get better but poor 13 to 15 October ,"Got to the hotel Friday 19:00 checkin was ok and warns of work been done on the Hotel, didn’t warn on Booking.com but anyway up to the the room 437 which was nice but was very warm. Window open and fan on as I had read aircon been installed in the hotel. Strange as aircon unit in the wall had dirt on so you would say not new.
Popped out came back at 22:30 to the room still baking hot.  Spoke to receptionist who told me “ i should have complained in the afternoon and they could of done something “ i also pointed out I arrived late. So with the hot air been moves around a hot room didn’t sleep well.
Breakfast at 7am was brilliant and to be honest the best bit of the trip.
After breakfast spoke to staff who requested i pack my bags so they could move rooms my choice was walk to the train station for the 08:04 private train or miss the train packing my bag. So a cool machine arranged for the room.
Arrived back Saturday 21:30 and offered a free drink but as up at 4am for a flight declined the drink. Car arranged by hotel to airport.
Went to the room found room baking hot with cool air machine turned off. Once machine on and sometimes after midnight the room finally cool to sleep i got an amazing 4 hours before alarm.

Hotel did offer to pay back one night as i did not move rooms but to move rooms would of meant missing the day trip i had travelled for.

So on hind sight great Breakfast and great at ordering a Taxi but as a hotel for sleeping in then for me no thanks.
For staff to point out on the first night it was my fault the room was to hot because i hadn’t reported it sooner was unexpected as I hadn’t arrived at 14:00 but arrived late in the day.
Since getting home have seen policy is to refund the trip if not satisfied guaranteed well  i didnt get both nights as it was my fault i was out from 07:30 to 21:30 Saturday. 

So if you want to stay remember building work until 2018 which i wasnt warn about in advance but big signs in the lobby.
So thats ok second the breakfast is great so £300 for a good breakfast with no sleep

All the best for the work been completed in late 2017 until then please check with hotel and learn from my mistake

228,"Slightly dated, but well located","The hotel is undergoing extensive renovations, so some of my concerns may soon disappear.  The property is older, so it doesn't have all the conveniences that I would expect of a Hilton.  Most importantly, our room didn't have air conditioning.  this wasn't a huge problem in September, but could be at other times of the year.  Air conditioning also offers some white house, which would have come in handy during our stay.  The room did have a  fan and the window opened enough to get some fresh air.

Our room was on the smaller side. It was fine for two people who were out of the room most of the time, but could have gotten close otherwise.

The staff were very friendly and helpful with baggage storage.

If you are leaving for the airport during morning rush hour, reserve a cab in advance.",4,2017,10,13
228,Good location - Great staff!,"We arrived a day early for our Ireland tour and stayed here for one night.
The hotel is under construction as they are adding a number of rooms to the upper
floor. We had some noise during the day from 9AM to 5PM but wasn't a problem.

The front desk staff was very helpful. We arrived at 8AM after an overnight flight from
the US. Of course a room wasn't ready but they put our luggage in a holding area so
that we were free to explore Dublin. When we returned in the afternoon, the room
was ready.

The room was very nice and had been reconditioned.

The location on the River Liffey was convenient to the city.

Would stay here again when in Dublin.",4,2017,10,13
228,Pleasurable experience,Costly but probably typical of a city hotel. The room was an excellent size but unfortunately had only one easy chair for 3 people. Apologies were given for the renovation work. Would definitely stay here again,5,2017,10,11
228,Overall good except shower drainage.,"Nice clean room.  Good WiFi.  Comfortable beds.  Easy check-in and check-out.  Friendly helpful staff.  Our one complaint...the shower wouldn't drain.  Ended up standing in water and having to be careful it didn't splash over onto the floor.  Took a few minutes for the water to drain after the shower stopped.  I reported it after our first showers, but it happened again our second day.",4,2017,10,10
228,Disappointing & inflexible,"I was perhaps a little misled by the photos. Really pretty dated hotel. The staff were really lovely to be fair but my room was not up to much. Most annoying was that I had booked for two nights and have then 24 hours notice I only needed one night which they said was fine. But when I checked the charge on my card afterwards they had not only charged me for two nights but also at a rate higher than was agreed when I booked. So all in all a hotel best avoided IMO, even though staff and location excellent",2,2017,10,10
228,Leisure trip,"The hotel is in a convinient location for vacation. Walking distance to many places of interest. O'Connell street is a short walk, and has many shops, pubs and restaurants. The hotel is right in the river, so you have access to many if the bridges, where Trinity College, restaurants are located ",5,2017,10,10
228,Enjoyable stay,My wife and I had a very enjoyable stay in this hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. The whole hotel was very clean. The location was ideal. We walked to the 3 arena and the following day walked to O'Connell Street.,5,2017,10,10
228,Great Experience,"Great staff, friendly, clean hotel in a very convenient spot.  Will stay again.  I have stayed at several hotels over the years and this Hilton ranks at the top for the value.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone to stay at.",5,2017,10,10
228,Great hotel and location is perfect.,"10/15 min walk to temple bar and Grafton Street areas. 10 minute walk to 3Arena.
Rooms spacious and clean. Breakfast was very nice - plenty of choice from full English, continental, waffle maker, pastry’s etc.
Hotel was undergoing works at time of our stay but we were not affected in the slightest. 
All staff were very helpful and polite. ",5,2017,10,10
228,DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THIS...,"Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in, bar none! To be fair, the staff tried to rectify things in many ways (free breakfast 2 days out of the 3 day stay we had), but frankly they were inept and extremely poor at communicating with us.

For starters, the hotel was undergoing renovations to add air conditioning to the rooms. Great! Except that we had a major stench coming from our bathroom, which was hidden from us because the heat was turned off in our room at check-in. Once we turned on the heat, the stench was God-awful! We informed management, who then sent the cleaning staff up to check it out... But our room was spotless! We called the desk again, and the manager on duty (Dechlan) came up to see for himself. Once he experienced the issue firsthand, Dechlan moved us to another room... However, this room was smaller than we paid for!! 

Also, we needed to print out boarding passes for the “Hop On, Hop Off” tour as well as our return flight home. Their business center’s computer needs major updating, as both my wife and I couldn’t sign on to our emails to print, as their CPU didn’t have Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, Safari or Mozilla Firefox... And the staff wouldn’t update their outdated technology!! They ultimately did print our passes by having us email them to the staff, but in my wife’s case it took 40 minutes for Jan (another manager) to receive the email. We’ve never had issues like this in all of our 20 years of travel ANYWHERE!! 

The restaurant in the hotel, Oly’s, is great for breakfast. Cleaning staff is very good! As for the front desk staff and Management? Awful, absolutely awfull!!! And on our way out, we asked them to call us a ride to the airport that took a credit card, and they refused! BRUTAL!",1,2017,10,03
228,Conference in Dubling,This hotel was in the perfect location for work and fun.  The staff is friendly and courteous.   The hotel is newly renovated with great rooms and wonderfully cool air conditioning.  You are within walking distance of the Dublin Conference Center as well as all the city tourist areas.  I would stay here again and again.,5,2017,10,03
228,Good hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights and despite the renovations had no issues. The room was decently sized, comfortable and quite modern. The hotel is well located for transport options and for walking to the sights of Dublin. Staff were very helpful and the breakfast was very good. The only small negative is the lack of space in the bathroom to store items during a stay and the shower curtain (I personally hate them). It is either outside the bath leading to the floor flooding or it is in the bath and wrapping around you as you shower, which is very unpleasant. This was more than offset by the fact that the hotel has a guest laundry - great idea, only wish more hotels offered this.",4,2017,10,02
228,Great hotel and stadd,"Stayed here or 5 nights and front desk staff were amazing.  Vlasta and Alex went beyond customer service.  They made us feel at home, and even though hotel was under construction with addition of floors, It had no effect on us whatsoever. Location was amazing as was Oly's bar & restaurant food and staff.",5,2017,10,02
228,"Will be great, once the renovations are complete","Hotel room was very nice and the location was great!  The hotel is in the middle of renovations so you can see a lot of that outside and in.  We weren't personally bothered by noise, but we arrived late and left early.  The one annoyance for us was the lack of dining for late/early. The bar was open when we arrived, but the kitchen had closed.  When we left in the morning breakfast was not yet served.  Airport bus is right outside the doors, the bus depot is just a few blocks over, and the city is within walking range.  We'd definitely stay again!",4,2017,10,01
228,Excellent Place to Stay in Dublin,"Located just a few blocks from the city center of Dublin--easy and cheap cab ride to Temple Area.  Hotel was being renovated but that did not bother us at all.  Staff was very accommodating, the rooms were spacious and comfortable and very clean, and the breakfast was first class.  We were very pleased and would go out of our way to stay here again.",5,2017,10,01
228,Building work,Building work going on . The banging and shouting Starts super early . The rooms are hot as there is no air conditioning atm. Don't know when it will be finished .it will probs be nice then .the location is very good ,2,2017,10,01
228,Excellent choice...,"I stayed here for 4 night and we had the family room. It was very spacious and an excellent choice. I really like the hotel. The staff was phenomenal. The front desk agents were all very friendly especially Alex, Monica and Tedossa ( I think I spelled that correct) and the guys were very nice on the night crew as well. Alex was very helpful to me and helped me with what almost was an emergency. The price was very reasonable. The Orly restaurant inside has very good food and the waitress or restaurant agent Csilla omg was absolutely wonderful. She was the reason that I ate at the restaurant literally every day whether it was breakfast or lunch or a late dinner snack. Csilla had the most wonderful sense of humor and was super funny. She made my stay worthwhile. The only con with this hotel is they are under construction adding more rooms and adding air conditioner to all the rooms ( imagine a hotel w/o AC)but I can’t believe or understand why they allow the construction workers start working before 9am. It’s such a disturbance because at 6am the workers start hammering and drilling and it’s very disturbing if you are trying to sleep in. They need to put a clause in their contract where they can’t wrk b4 9:00am. I was tired and sleepy and all I heard was drills. Also I don’t know if it was because of the construction but later at night I would smell a little cigarette smoke coming out the vents. I reported it cause I thought someone was smoking in a non smoking room but they checked and said they didn’t find anyone smoking. Last if u rent a car parking is a little high to me 18euros per day and that’s with the discount (the hotel validates your tckts for the discount. Other than those things I would stay here again because it’s right in the thick of things and a lot of attraction within walking distances. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It’s very clean as well. ",4,2017,09,29
228,Great location be aware of the construction work,"Good location to get around Dublin, lack of air conditioning and noise because of the ongoing work at the hotel. Once work is completed would be a very good choice to utilise when visiting Dublin. Good staff",4,2017,09,28
228,Stag do ,"Really rated this hotel, rooms spacious and clean, staff really helpful at anytime day or night. 

It has a fantastic location on the river only about a 10min walk from temple bar which is a awesome place full of bars. 

The food at the hotel was also very good, although I was rather drunk when I ate it. 

Would definitely stay again ",4,2017,09,27
228,Genealogy visit to Ireland/dublin,"Used this Hilton as a hub for genealogy research in Dublin.  Good walking access to trinity college and the national library of Ireland.  Also walkable to the temple bar area and o'connell street.  It's still under restoration but we heard no construction noise.  Our room did not have AC - but Windows and a fan made it manageable.  The staff were cordial and helpful.  The breakfast was great, the restaurant was good, and the Guiness was cheaper than at temple bar area.  We would stay there again and it will only be better when the construction is done.",4,2017,09,27
228,"Great breakfast, and good location on river!","It's pretty basic and functional, but that's exactly what we needed!   The hotel has a very positive energy, with great Dublin photos decorating the rooms.   It is a super convenient location for tourist adventures, and attending concerts at the 3Arena.   And, the breakfast is really something special for a non-fancy hotel.   Even though construction work was underway, and the room was directly above a road busy with busses, we loved every minute of staying here. ",5,2017,09,26
228,Dublin conference visit,"A well situated hotel with comfortable rooms and friendly service. A little pricey for the lone traveller, but nevertheless centrally located beside the river Liffey and just a couple of blocks from the convention centre. Enjoyed the breakfasts.",4,2017,09,26
228,Construction noise,"We were awakened very early every morning during our stay by construction noise, including the weekend. It is not accurately stated on the hotel website that construction will occur only from 10 a.m till 6 p.m.",1,2017,09,25
228,Attending Concert in 3 Arena,"Myself and my husband stayed here as we were attending a concert in the 3 Arena and the hotel is within walking distance. The reception staff were friendly, efficient, helpful and very knowledgeable on local transport and the local area. We ate in the restaurant which is very comfortable and our food was served promptly and was fresh and very tasty. Our room was comfortable but was a bit overcrowded with 2 double beds. Although, it worked fine for 2 adults but it would be very cramped if you had a child staying in the room too. It was spotlessly clean and well equipped. The bathroom was immaculately clean and there were plenty towels provided. As the hotel is undergoing complete renovations the air conditioning was not working but a fan was provided and the room temperature was comfortable. Other than the air-conditioning the renovations did not impact on our stay. All in all this hotel provided everything we needed, close to 3Arena, no parking complications, a comfortable room, good food and a nice bar for a quiet drink.",5,2017,09,25
228,Great hotel and location,This hotel is a great location.  It's not easy to find rooms with two queen beds but their family room was perfect. We also had the best dinner of our entire trip in the restaurant. It was really spectacular food.,5,2017,09,25
228,Trip to Dublin Theatre,My wife and I chose this hotel because of close proximity to theatre. The quality of food both dinner and breakfast was excellent although we thought the breakfast staff were not very attentive and took a long time to clear used plates etc. And had to asked twice to refill the butter tray. The room was clean and modern but being at the back of hotel was very dark.,4,2017,09,24
228,Girls break,Fantastic! Rooms reasonable size and gave us adjoining rooms. Staff couldnt do enough for you. Well done to all. Ate in the reastaurant on the 1st night. 2 course meal for 20 euros but worth every single penny. Slow cooked beef steak with pepper sauce highly recommended.breakfast excellent and you can even have a go at making your own waffles. WONDERFUL. ,4,2017,09,24
228,Excellent base for Dublin visit,Stayed here for a 3 day visit to Dublin.  Within walking distance of main shopping / Book of Kells / University etc and hop on / hop off tour busses all stop nearby.   Strongly recommend this hotel - worked perfectly for us. ,4,2017,09,23
228,5*,"Lovely spacious room, tea and coffee topped up daily and fresh towels, no issues regarding construction work currently ongoing, close enough to city centre and 3arena , Irish breakfast was delicious, would definitely stay here again!! ",5,2017,09,23
228,Lovely!,"One of the nicest Hilton’s I’ve stayed in yet!! Really friendly staff, check in was easy and lovely big rooms!! After a busy day in Dublin, coming back to our hotel room was lovely. We booked 3 rooms and we were all next to each other which was great. A lot of comments being made about the building work but that didn’t affect us that much. We checked in on a Friday and checked out on the following Monday, and work started around 9am Monday morning which is completely reasonable!! Will stay here again on my next trip to the lovely city!",5,2017,09,21
228,Under Renovation but not an issue,"The staff at this hotel were extremely helpful and friendly! Even the housekeeping staff made. Point of stopping their work to greet a guest when they saw them. 

The hotel was clear they were under renovations when we booked so we were worried, but were pleasantly surprised.

The location is a short 10-13 min walk to temple bar area, but nothing to extreme. 

The rooms on the front side can be somewhat noisy during rush hour traffic times.",3,2017,09,20
228,GreatDublin visit,"Great stay in Dublin
This was a new area for us in Dublin which was fun to explore. It was convenient to museums and a easy walk tithe Temple Bar and Graftion Street areas. We used air link for airport transportation, which was very convenient.",4,2017,09,20
228,Front Desk Staff were Lovely,The front office desk were very efficient and lovely especially after arriving to the hotel very late and very tired after a long drive to Dublin.  The location is a little outside the town so need  to take taxis or the luas behind the hotel.  The hotel having construction currently so the parking garage access to the hotel VERY INCONVENIENT. We met friends and family in the bar and restaurant and had a meal and drinks it was very good and the service was good.  The breakfast was good especially the omelets.,4,2017,09,20
228,Quality staff and hotel,"Took the bus from the airport to the hotel, just a short distance away. You get your bus ticket just outside the terminal,14 euros. Paid with a credit card. The Hilton staff was so helpful. Ask a question and the staff gets answers. The room had every convenience. They have a computer and printer in the lobby. The buffet breakfast was fabulous. We walked from the hotel to most of the sights. We stayed there two nights.",5,2017,09,18
228,Modern hotel on the river,"We stayed here for a long weekend and found the hotel to be bright, modern with plenty of friendly staff. Situated on the river and a 10minute or so walk to O'Connell street it is well situated for a Dublin weekend. Buses, trams and the Dart are all within walking distance and plenty of taxis which pull up outside the hotel make it easy to get round if you dont fancy walking. Breakfast in the hotel is extra to room rate and not the best but also not the worst we've ever had. Overall a tad expensive for what you get but probably paying this rate for the busy destination that Dublin has become",3,2017,09,18
228,Good Location -Great Stay,"We stayed two nights, and we were very happy with our choice.  The hotel is located on the airline 747 and 757 line. It drops you off a short walk from the hotel.  We found the staff super friendly and helpful.  There were 3 of us in the room with two beds, and it felt roomy enough for us.  The bathroom was large and functional.  Due to our Gold Hhonors status, we were given two complimentary breakfasts and paid 13 Euro for the third.  It was well worth it.  The food was plentiful, hot, and tasty.  We found the hotel easy walking distance to the main sights in Dublin. The ongoing construction was no problem whatsoever.   Dublin is an easy walking city.  We'd definitely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House again.",4,2017,09,17
228,Dublin 4 day trip,"My family stayed at the Garden Inn in early  September 2017 while it was being remodeled. Conveniently located next to the EPIC Museum and light and commuter rail, it gave us an opportunity to explore the city without being too close to the tourist center. Taxi service to and from the hotel was excellent, and we happened to stumble upon a Game of Thrones Tour that departed from this location which made it even easier to enjoy the sights.

The hotel has many restaurants and amenities near by, in an area that is not overrun by tourists or foot traffic. The lobby bar has an excellent variety of drinks and fare, and is open until later than some local places. If you miss the restaurant or bar hours, they have a small store right in front of the reception desks that has water and snacks, as well as toiletries, for a reasonable fee.

The hotel has a nice gym, laundry room, small business center and lots of good space to congregate. The rooms are spacious and clean, well worth the price.

Enjoy!",5,2017,09,17
228,Hot and noisy,The room was awful really really hot with no air conditioning and as the room overlooked the main road if you tried to sleep with the window open the noise levels were unbearable. It wasn't even a warm day so dread to think how much more uncomfortable it would have been in the summer. We got barely any sleep.,1,2017,09,16
228,Great now it has air con ,"I laid in bed as had a late start thinking this is the best room I've stayed in (and I've stayed in a lot) 

Lovely comfy bed - ✅ 

Room temp perfect (quiet air con) - ✅ 

Very quiet even though on floor 1 above reception by the lift -  ✅ 

What more do you want? 

One criticism is the water pressure. Hot was fine but was red hot, cold was a little lacking. They were having the hotel renovated when we were there so maybe they will sort this. 

Bar was ok, friendly bar staff

Fish and chips looked nice but didn't have it myself. 

€1 for a bottle of water, not bad. Other snacks available too. 

At the time of writing the hotel was having air con installed, so I would definitely ask for that as my first room was 24 degree! 

Would stay again  ",5,2017,09,15
228,"likely to be nice when all the construction is done, but NOT NOW","I have seen that some people have rated this hotel high and some, like me, quite low.  To be clear, the rating I am giving is because I do not think the hotel should stay in operation whilst there is a MAJOR construction going on.  The hotel is not being honest in suggesting that the construction is kept within specific hours.  Inside each room is a card that says 10-6--that is not honest and not true.  The construction began at 7 a.m. this morning and please do not be fooled by anyone to say it is only on the high floors or front part or there is a quieter part.  The way the hotel is built the material for the construction is at the ground level in the back so lower floors (ostensibly quieter) hear the moving of equipment, the upper floors get the noise of banging as does the front part.  So if you do not care about this and are early risers, then fine.  The hotel otherwise, is quite nice but I did not appreciate being told less than truths by the front desk staff.  I will contact the management about this but for the moment, my strong suggestion is that even if cheap, avoid this hotel until the construction is finished.

The hotel is located on the river, just over from the Southside of Dublin.  About a 10 minute or so walk to Temple Bar.  The IFC is nearby that has several fast food places in it but bars and other places to go out are about a 10-15 minute walk.  There is a pleasant lobby and nice looking bar area (we did not use).  The rooms are well equipped--safe, iron/board and good size beds/bathrooms.  The updates from the former Jury's are quite nice.  So again, later, when all is done, this will be fine.",1,2017,09,12
228,"Hilton Garden Inn - Dublin, Ireland",Excellent hotel in a great location.  Good value for the money.  Friendly staff will assist on getting Gael tour or tours to castles and sites.  Hop-on/Hop-off bus stop is right in front of hotel.  Hotel location is good for walking to many sites and pubs.  On main street and on the river.  Restaurant food was good for lunch dinner.,5,2017,09,11
228,I will bump up to 4 when the air con is installed ,"Stayed here a couple of times when in town on business.  Nice Hilton, friendly staff.  Good location for the docks, the 3arena, bord gais theatre etc all within walking distance.   Air con is currently being installed, this is desperately needed.  There is scaffolding around the hotel due to this and extension work. The work is undertaken during the day so it didn't effect my stay. 

",3,2017,09,10
228,Business trip,I stayed there for business in September. The hotel is undergoing refurbishment and it is operating as normal. However it should not. The rates at far too high for a room with no air condition or heating of any kind. It was noisy humid and at 900 EUR for 4 nights am absolute diagrace. And I am a HH member!!!,1,2017,09,09
228,Lack of Air Conditioning,"Fortunately, they did have a fan in the room for air flow but it would get very warm in the room.  We were facing toward the river so it was the busy side of the hotel and we couldn't leave the window open all night due to the noise.  We weren't in the room enough for it to matter but we do like to be cooler when we sleep.  This would not be a big problem most of the year as I suspect we had warmer than normal temperatures outside.  The breakfast bar was great and had many selections.  This hotel was close to many tourist destinations but not so close that it was party central.  The staff were friendly and they had a nice kiosk to buy hop on hop off bus tickets and other tourist attraction tickets.  We went on two different day tours with two different companies and the tours left from OConnell Street which was about a 15 minute walk.  The hotel was very comfortable and I would stay here again even if it did not have air conditioning.",4,2017,09,08
228,Nice hotel,"I stayed here for 2 nights to see a concert in Bord Gáis. Really convenient location. 5-10 minute walk to venue and busáras. Room was lovely, clean and comfortable. Nice bathroom. Tea and coffee making facilities in room and Costa to purchase in lobby. Fridge in room. View not so good. Looking at car park wall. But I suppose they can't all overlook the river and we weren't there to look out if the window. We didn't eat in hotel but ate in a few places just round the corner; both breakfast and dinner. 
If walking back to hotel at night stick to main road. We had no issues but I'm familiar with Dublin and some areas between O'Connell Street and hotel not just so good. Not saying to scare. I'd stay in this hotel again.",4,2017,09,07
228,"Quality hotel, but visiting this city is too expensive","This is an upscale luxury hotel located in the business district of Dublin, about 15 minutes' walking distance from the centre of town. All the nice things that the other reviewers have said about this hotel are true. 

In particular, I'd like to mention the strong wifi and the very comfortable large bed. In truth, our room was really nice. We had everything we needed.

The breakfast was expansive, varied and delicious.  

I'll just point out the one thing that bothered me: I didn't like walking to and from the city centre every day. It's ridiculous for me to even mention this, however, because it is not that far at all. The tram goes towards the centre leaves from a stop behind the hotel, only a 100 metres away or so. It's our own fault that we didn't feel like taking it (since the walk along the river was so nice). We were in a good location to explore the arguably more authentic north side of the city. And being right on the Liffey was glorious.

The museum is right beside the EPIC museum and the business district, so if that is a big part of your trip, the location is excellent for that.

I don't intend this review to degenerate into a rant about the ridiculously high prices of quality hotel rooms in Dublin. Even though we apparently got a good rate for this nice hotel, it was still just too much. Dublin is an OK town, but it isn't worth these high prices. We'll skip Dublin next time.

The bus stop for bus 757 stops right in front of this hotel. So please find the right bus at the airport and take it. It doesn't make sense to come here any other way.

Recommendation: thumbs up.",4,2017,09,06
228,Lovely Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel while attending a concert at the 3 arena. It was a very nice hotel, clean and the staff were very helpful. We had to leave very early the next morning due to work commitments therefore missing out on our already paid breakfast. But they were very accommodating to our situation and gave us take away breakfasts. 
 
The guy that was on the night reception was more than helpful. I'm sorry though I can't remember his name. 
We will definitely be back again.",5,2017,09,06
228,Fantastic Hotel,"The hotel was very clean, staff super friendly and we had absolutely no problems while we were staying. The air conditions was no big deal, felt comfortable for the entire stay.  Scaffolding was up but no work occurred until after 0900. The only downside was you are about .6 miles from the action n the south side of the river. Not a problem if you can walk a little. It was why it was less to stay on the north side. Grabbed a cab one night after a pub crawl and it was under 10 euro from temple bar. It's also right on the 747 bus line from the airport.

Here is how you get a five in my mind. I messed up and booked a day earlier than I should have, totally my fault. The hotel was kind enough to allow us to use that first day fee for the restaurant. When we checked out we did not use any of the money. Without my asking or complaining ( it was my error after all) the woman who checked us out at the front desk talked to the manage and they refunded our full amount.
",5,2017,09,05
228,3arena event,"I stayed here for 1 night as i was attending an event in the 3 arena and this hotel is only a 10 to 15 mins walk away. Hotel was a bit pricey for an overnight stay, but the hotel roo. Itself was lovely and clean, with a comfy bed. Staff are friendly and public areas are well presented. I didn't have breakfast so can't comment on that.",4,2017,09,03
228,Short break,"Great hotel, very clean and lovely staff, will be perfect once air conditioning is completed - we would definitely recommend and would visit again.
There is some street noise with windows open but in a busy city you would expect this - with windows closed not a problem.
",5,2017,09,03
228,Poor value for money,"Dublin certainly is expensive in terms of accommodation, but there still is the question of value for money and that's where the HGI falls short.

We had booked it on the basis of the Hilton brand, and great experiences with HGI hotels in other places. So we were disappointed to find that the Dublin hotel does not deliver on the brand promise.
Rooms are very small with extremely thin walls, so be prepared to hear your neighbors sneeze and chit-chat. And we had newly refurbished rooms including air conditioning.
You can clearly see how they've taken what was close to a Motel 6, slapped a Hilton logo on it and tripled the rates.

Breakfast, which was included in our rate, proved to be another disappointment. It's along the lines of what you'd get for free e.g. at a Hampton Inn - low quality, in a cramped environment, and poorly maintained (at least one of 2 coffee dispensers was usually out of service). Certainly not worth the €14 they ask for it separately.

The hotel location is pretty good, a bit outside of the main hustle but in easy walking distance (about 10 min) to most places in the center. In view of the above we'd nonetheless definitely use a different place if we were to return to Dublin.",3,2017,09,03
228,Great stay,"Hotel is undergoing big expansion upwards. Very comfortable bedrooms. Food is excellent. Location is good on the quay near Dublin port, on edge of financial district. 
Parking not available so need to use multi storey car park behind it, at discount. ",4,2017,09,03
228,"Nice place, but some disappointments","Great hotel and within walking distance to anything in Dublin you want to see. Being a HH member, I was quite disappointed that there was no air conditioning in the hotel, although they were working on installing it while we were there. $250USD for a hotel with no air conditioning is pretty frustrating. Staff were very kind and accommodating.",3,2017,09,01
228,No air-conditioning,The website mentions that renovations re. adding 85 rooms are ongoing but it did not mention that this meant there was no air-conditioning in the hotel. Placing a small. 12 inch fan in a room is no substitute for air-conditioning and one would have thought that a rate reduction was in order as the room was very hot at night and the windows could not open very far. The food in the restaurant at dinner was not the best so we only ate there one night.,3,2017,08,31
228,"Well located, very clean and welcoming","We stayed 2 nights as we were going to a friends wedding nearby in the Merrion Hotel.
The property is undergoing a major renovation and is adding 85 rooms by adding an additional floor.
Our room on the 3 floor was very clean. The bathroom was very large as was the bed (it seemed like a king or superking very comfortable) unfortunately the room wasn't very big so it was difficult to get changed etc. It just seems like there is too much furniture for the room.
The TV was massive and it obscured some of the mirror and there was also a picture in the same area. It was just too cluttered.
I have attached some pictures for you to see.
The renovation work is not too loud and didn't affect out stay. I would stay here again as its so well located in the city and the staff are friendly. The rooms and public areas are well lit, clean and tidy. A very nice place.
",4,2017,08,29
228,Get treated as a King,"During my stay at the Dublin Hilton Garden Inn, the service I received from the entire staff was simply flawless. Every single time I encountered a hotel employee whether it was at the front desk, restaurant, lobby, leaving my room, my presence was acknowledge with a smile and a greeting. Every single request we had, and for some reason in this trip we ended up having many, your staff went above and beyond to meet it without a complain. We went to Ireland to learn about its history and visit many of the medieval castles.....but the level of service we received at this hotel has raised up the bar on what we should expect going forward. We were treated as Kings by your entire staff! Not only will I stay in this hotel the next time I visit Dublin, but I will also HIGHLY recommend it to my work associates and friends. Thank you.",5,2017,08,29
228,Good clean modern hotel,"Conveniently located on North Wall Quay. Has everything one would expect of a Hilton. Is being refurbished for air conditioning, but no inconvenience to the inside. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good and varied.",4,2017,08,29
228,"Modern, Tidy, Polite staff - not much view","I stayed for one night for a work trip and was very happy with the cleanliness, of the hotel and the room.  The staff were polite and chatty on reception and the bar stocked what you need.  Great location to walk in and out of the town.  Breakfast is standard buffet and tasty enough.  My room had zero view onto another building so at the back of the building but didn't bother me for one night.",4,2017,08,29
228,Relaxing hotel.,"The hotel - though having renovations ongoing - is a good hotel to stay. Welcoming staff, well equipped rooms with comfortable beds and a lot of handy services at hand, e.g. a business center to print museum tickets and boarding passes. Bus stops for the sightseeing buses and airport links in front of the hotel. The hotel is next to the EPIC Museum of Irish emigration which is with a visit. But, before you move somewhere on the day: kick off with an excellent breakfast from the very generous and tasty buffet.",4,2017,08,28
228,Good location - housekeeping is horrible,"The good: The location of the hotel is convenient - about a 10-15 minute walk from both the center of the city and also Croke Park. It's right around the corner from a tram stop which makes it easier to get to farther spots like Guinness. 

There is a restaurant on the ground floor (we didn't eat there) and also a coffee shop. The hotel is also next to the Custom House Quay, a little shopping center with a few coffee shops. Right in front of the hotel 3 different hop-on, hop-off tour buses stop. 

We had read a number of reviews that said there was no A/C in some rooms, so as a Hilton Honors member I contacted Hilton and specifically requested a room with A/C. While they said it was not a guarantee, they said it would be noted on our reservation, and we did end up with a room with A/C. 

The room we had was one that had been recently renovated. We also read about renovations currently going on at the hotel, and there was a note in the room that stated they would occur from 10am-6pm M-F. Since we were out during those times, any noise from renovations did not affect us and it was quiet enough. Windows were double-paned. But if there was no A/C in your room and you had to leave the windows open I could see where it might be noisy to sleep as the hotel is next to the road. 

The bad: The main problem we had was with housekeeping, which was just abysmal. We stayed 4 nights - so needed housekeeping 3 days. The first day we came back to the room at 4:30pm after touring around. The room hadn't been cleaned - at 4:30! We were tired and wanted to rest and clean up before dinner so we just found the housekeeper down the hall and just asked for extra toiletries. 

The second day, the room was barely cleaned. We had gotten an extra blanket and it came in a plastic zippered blanket bag, which the housekeeper left on the floor. The glasses in the bathroom were still dirty and not replaced. We had used one of the paper glass top covers as a coaster and it was left on the nightstand and not thrown out. We didn't want to be ""those people"" and complain so we didn't say anything.

However the 3rd day was even worse. The same issues remained - plastic bag on the floor, dirty cups, paper coaster not thrown out, and to top it off, the extra blanket was just balled up on top of the bed. The pillows were still mushed like they had been when we woke up. All they did it seems was give us new toiletries and empty the garbage cans.  

Even though we were checking out the next day, at that point we had to say something - even though we wouldn't benefit management had to know because it was unacceptable. The manager called me back right away, was apologetic, and offered to pay our cab fare to the airport the next day. I appreciate that it was handled promptly, but the housekeeping service was unacceptable. I don't think I've ever stayed anywhere they didn't even make the bed.",3,2017,08,27
228,Incompetent and No Aircon,We were guaranteed a front facing room if we hung about for 3 hrs.  We did some exploring and came back to find ourselves put in a dingy back room.  Worse: there was no aircon in most of the hotel because of so-called renovations. Our room was boiling hot and the window opened no more than a few centimeters.   Onto a building site.  Don't bother to stay at this hotel.  There are much better options available.  ,1,2017,08,26
228,Good location but too expensive.,I have been surprised by the rates applied by the hotel since they are on the economy side. The room is clearly a 3 stars. They were installing the air conditioning when we've been there but the outside temperature was around 20 degrees C during the day therefore cannot say that we really need it.,3,2017,08,24
228,"Good location, NO air-conditioning, Terrible Parking","Amenities were standard to most Hilton Garden Inns, except for the fact that there was no air-conditioning! The rooms were clean, but small. Leave your car at home because the parking situation is a nightmare.",3,2017,08,21
228,Fantastic Views Along the River Liffey,"Located along the northern bank the river Liffey and just outside the hustle and bustle of the Temple Bar District this hotel is easily accessible for the bus tours, cab service and train station (just 600 meters away)",5,2017,08,20
228,A good base to explore,"Hotel in good location just out of the temple bar district 
Good sized rooms with all you need for a weekend stay ,spotlessly clean and decent bathroom 
Bar area not very atmospheric but reasonably priced and nice selection of bar food 
Reception staff polite and extremely helpful ,the only downside was there is refurbishment work going on and could have done with more of a lay in Saturday after a late arrival on Friday 
Would defiantly use again when we return ",4,2017,08,20
228,"Great Location, great front desk, good room, and Laundry!","I was pleasantly surprised by the convenience of this hotel.  We were in Dublin for three days, and found the hotel easily from the Airlink bus. (we'd bought the 3 day Freedom Pass at the airport, from a vendor called ""Excess Baggage"" to the right of the baggage claim hall).  We arrived at the hotel before their check-in.  The front desk clerk arranged to have our bags stored and texted us when our room was ready.

While many of Dublin's tourist attractions are across the river, we found it was easy to use the bus to reach some of the further away tourist attractions like Kilmainham Gaol and Guinness. There is a bus stop outside the hotel, but many of the tourist sites west of the hotel can be reached directly by buses leaving from the Custom's House area. 

In addition, attractions like the Temple Bar area or Trinity College are a relatively easy walk. There is a nice pedestrian bridge across the river in front of the hotel, but we also found walking along the north-side of the river to reach the many other bridges was quite pleasant.  FYI, if you are looking for great coffee and bagels, Seven Wonders is a short walk to the east of the hotel along the river.

Our room was clean and nice, albeit a little small.  During the day, we could hear the renovations taking place on the floor above us.  However, we appreciated having two reasonably sized, comfortable beds and slept well.  In addition, we were mid-way through an extended trip and made good use of the relatively new, coin operated washing machines and separate dryers that actually worked well. The front desk was very helpful in making change for the machines.  I don't remember the exact cost, but it was reasonable.

After we checked out, my son realized he'd left some shoes in the hotel.  We had an early morning flight and had moved to the Hilton by the airport (or so they said).  The front desk at the Hilton Garden Inn was able to locate his shoes and we made the trip back in to pick them up.  I'm generally not one who interacts a lot with the front desk, but these folks were very helpful, especially Soledad.

All in all, I would stay here again without hesitation.",4,2017,08,18
228,Another Great Garden Inn,"Although we were staying with a friend in Wicklow, Ireland, our host had booked us on an all-day tour to Blarney Castle, Cork, and the Rock of Cashel. The tour began at 8:00 am in Dublin, so we stayed overnight at the Garden Inn to save time. When we arrived, Vlasta efficiently checked us in and answered all our questions about parking, breakfast, and engaging a taxi to the tour bus the next morning. A breakfast in a bag awaited us and the taxi was prompt. Our luggage was stowed for our return. As for the overnight, the rooms were well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. Two items were particularly helpful: a tiny flexible bedside lamp on each side of the bed (see photo) and a very quiet flush of the toilet. I’ve stayed in hotels where I’ve heard the toilet flush from other rooms all hours of the night and day. It seems like a small detail, but the toilets were barely audible, and fast. There was a radiator in the room with no thermostat, but there was an electric fan which was adequate. See photo to show how the window opens for air. It was a quick stay, but very enjoyable. And yes, I kissed the Blarney Stone!",4,2017,08,15
228,Great location,"Excellent service and friendly staff in a great location close
To the 747 airport bus and walking distance to the main
Part of town. They had a nice 
Gym to work out . The site seeing
Bus stops at the hotel door.
",5,2017,08,14
228,Very nice ,"This is an excellent property in the financial district of Dublin. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The rooms are being updated.(Work started between 0830-0900am during the week) Didn't catch us off guard we were warned ahead of time. 

   The room was very nicely appointed. Plentiful USB outlets in the room. Private bathroom was modern and efficient. 

   As for location for touring,  several hop on hop off tour buses have a stop right out front of the hotel. With access to all the major tourist sites. The airport bus 747/757 have a stop on the way in and out from/to the airport. Walking to The Temple Bar area and Trinity College are about half mile along and near the River Liffey. 

I would stay here and recommend it. ",5,2017,08,12
228,Near the Liffey and city center!,"Great place to stay when you visit Dublin. Nice, very clean and comfortable rooms. 
Friendly staff and delicous breakfast. Not only the sweet breakfast is great, they offer healthy breakfast options as well! Loved it!",5,2017,08,12
228,Hilton Dublin by the Liffey ,"Loved the customer service at the Hilton
No matter what we needed they provided 
Top notch hotel for an extended stay both business and vacation. 
Both the dining area was always ready to provide dinner or lunch with excellent choices in foods 
Breakfast was a pleasure as well with a wide selection of foods 
With an eager chef to serve up whatever egg omelet you desire 
The rooms were plentiful as well as the bathrooms well kept freshly made daily ",5,2017,08,11
228,"Great location, clean and comfortable ","Hotel very clean and comfortable, we had a river view room and there was not much noise from the road. Breakfast was very good with a good choice. Hotel location was only a short walk away from the city centre, so a great location. The only annoying thing about the hotel is the music that they play in reception, it did get really annoying after sitting there for a while. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,2017,08,10
228,Great location and Staff is 5*****,"Right on the river in a bit quieter part of town.   There is a Airlink Bus stop right at hotel so makes getting in from Airport a breeze.    Also very convenient to Train Station if you are arriving or departing via train (as we did).   OK, the are doing some remodeling and upgrading to the hotel that I believe will be finished in Dec of 2017.   So just be aware if you are traveling between now and then that there might be a bit of construction but they were respectful of guests and did not begin work at first light.   There is a great bar, with a great bar menu (they even fixed us a pizza that was not listed for my picky eaters)   Good Coffee and breakfast bar and full restaurant.    Situated right on the river and a quick 10-15 walk to most activities (Trinity College, Temple Bar)    Folks, Dublin is a major city there is noise around at night (Cars....ect) but was the same you would find any big city.    Here is why this hotel ranks high in our opinion...the Staff and management.   Top notch.  Friendly, Helpful.    Stored our bags for us twice, gave great advice and directions, answered questions and tried to help the confused Americans figure out the power converters.    I actually blew a fuse on the floor once!!!   They were right up to fix it.     When the construction ends this year, this will be a top notch Dublin hotel.    Would stay there again in an second.",4,2017,08,09
228,As expected,"This hotel was very good from start to finish. My only comment would be that it is not the most convenient location unless you are on business. Still, it is in walking distance (lengthy) from everywhere. Nice staff, clean rooms....very good experience.",5,2017,08,09
228,Close to the Irish Ferries,"We chose to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn for one night because we were taking the Irish Ferry in the morning and this hotel was rather close to the port. We booked two rooms; one a family suite and the other was two double beds. Both rooms were clean and well appointed. The family suite was spacious and comfortable for four people. This hotel does not have air conditioning at this time. For our visit, that wasn't a problem but if it was any warmer that could've been uncomfortable. They are installing AC. The hotel is doing construction and while loud in the afternoon, it was quiet by evening. Overall, this hotel met our needs for our visit.",4,2017,08,09
228,Fabulous! Would stay again!,"Super easy to get to from the airport – bus 747 or 757 – stops right outside the hotel.  Fantastic lobby area, bar and restaurant.  Snacks and essentials available to buy in reception.  Complimentary cakes every day.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  City map available.  
Rooms were spacious, the single beds huge and very comfortable.  Not much noise at all and we slept well.  Great Wifi and TV.  Bathroom was spacious and had complimentary toiletries and plenty of towels.  My only complaint was the shower wasn’t very powerful so it took a long time to rinse my long hair.  There was a safe, iron, tea and coffee making facilities, mini-bar.  Lots of wardrobe space and a full length mirror.  We also had river views which were lovely! A high standard of cleanliness. 
It’s a good 10mins walk to the Temple Bar area, but it’s a pretty walk along the river.  We walked everywhere from the hotel – the Guinness Storehouse being a 40mins walk.  Most places of interest were roughly 15-30mins walk away.  We didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment on that aspect.  The hotel has excellent public transport links and the Hop On and Off bus stops right outside the hotel.
We loved this hotel and would stay here again!  I’d recommend for adults rather than children.",5,2017,08,08
228,Great choice.,"This was perfect from the start. Reception staff welcoming, polite and helpful (as were all the staff we came in contact with - kudos to the breakfast staff who were a delight and very hard working.) Breakfast buffet was repeatedly supplied with fresh, perfectly cooked food and noting the huge number of guests passing through did a far better job than other places we had stayed at on our vacation.
It was surprising - as well as a good sign - that the General Manager Ms. Murtagh was actually at the desk checking people in, helping out her staff and not in some back office. 
Room spotless and well supplied.
Despite the work going on to convert this from the old Jury's Inn (like other properties around Europe) and add a floor, which seems to have become protracted, we would not have known if it were not for the scaffolding outside.
Centrally located, we will definitely stay here again when we fly back to Ireland. 
Thanks Ms. Murtagh!",5,2017,08,07
228,"Hilton Inn Custom House in Dublin, Ireland","the rooms aren't air conditioned. They have 1 fan in the room.  Rooms are very small. We had 2 Adults, and one child. There is a  refrigerator, hair dryer and internet.  Restaurant is excellent. Staff is excellent. We also used the washer/dryer ourselves. Good to be able to do laundry!",3,2017,08,06
228,"Great hotel, poor restaurant service.","Staff in the hotel did an excellent job.  However, service in the restaurant was quite disappointing.  It seems like the wait staff are attentive to your first drink order and food order, but after that, their rarely check on you and it can be quite an effort to have your finished plates cleared, order dessert or get and pay your bill.",4,2017,08,04
228,"Central, good standard","Hotel is of good standard, and situated close to city center. Would recommend staying if you are looking for an overall good hotel. We had a room facing the back which was very quiet. Parking is good and close in the next door multi storey car park.
If you are looking for something exciting this hotel is perhaps on the boring side of things.",4,2017,08,02
228,"Well-located, clean, modern city hotel","My husband and I stayed for 2 nights on a weekend in July.  We weren't impacted by the construction on weekdays.  The hotel was an easy 25 Euro taxi ride from the airport.  We arrived mid-morning, and they far exceeded my expectations by allowing us to check in to our room at that time-huge bonus points!  The room was spacious, modern and totally clean.  The bathroom was also modern with a large shower/tub.  There is A/C, which turned out to be more useful than I thought in Ireland, given the cool weather.  But they were our best nights of sleep because it was cool!

There is not a concierge, but everyone at the front desk was helpful with directions and recommendations.  It was an easy walk to the City Center and most attractions, yet away from the bustle of the city.  Each morning, we needed a cab, and ordered one the night before, which worked out perfectly.  The cabbie even asks your room number to be sure it's your cab.

The restaurant was phenomenal for dinner (didn't eat breakfast here) and there is a small shop with any extras you'll need, or there are grocery stores nearby.  The safe was big enough for a laptop.  I would stay again, though hopefully could get a better price (we were there U2 weekend).",5,2017,08,01
228,Hilton Garden Inn - Dublin,"Clean, comfortable, with all the amenities - wonderful full Irish breakfast, inviting lobby area, bar and dining available. Staff go above and beyond to help - would stay again! Close to the Quay, walking distance to downtown Dublin, bus routes, LUAS, and many amenities. Highly recommend!",5,2017,08,01
228,Fantastic Location!!!,"Right on the RIver Liffey, the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House has marvellous views of the river and Dublin. The rooms are spacious and decently appointed. With an airport bus stop right at the front door, this hotel is convenient. In the Docklands area, it is close to a number of attractions and either a Luas (Light Rapid Transit) ride or short walk from downtown Dublin and many attractions. Lovely on-site restaurant/bar/coffee shop. Well appointed fitness room. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,31
228,Good Size Family Room,"Our family room had two beds in it that slept four. The room was ample sized and comfortable. The bathroom was nice but small. Our first room did not have AC but we were moved to a room with AC when we inquired. The breakfast was acceptable. Location is pretty good to reach major sites. Thought it was a little pricey but was happy to have a clean, comfortable bed to sleep in when first arriving in Dublin.",4,2017,07,31
228,Great place for families!,"We took our extended family on a trip to Ireland, and booked this hotel primarily because they offered family rooms for those of us with children in tow.  In addition, it's a nice location, near, but not in the middle of most tourist sights.  From the time we arrived at 8 am hoping for early access to our rooms, the hotel staff exceeded our expectations.  They worked hard to get us in as soon as they could, were very helpful and accommodating about needed services (extra blankets, pillows, etc) and suggestions for tourist options.  

Rooms were clean and spacious.  The restaurant offered a very nice full buffet breakfast at a very reasonable price (ours was included in our rate).  Three hop-on-hop-off bus lines stopped in front of the hotel.  

All in all, a very nice stop, with special thanks to the wonderful staff!",4,2017,07,31
228,Great family room ,"We had a nice family  room well recommended if you travel with children. Quiet room and comfy beds. 
Nice bar down at the ground floor. Parkinson behind the building. Great service at the reception. Happy to stay here again.",4,2017,07,31
228,Disappointing experience,"I would not rush back to this hotel. My room was presented as an upgrade, due to status, when it was in fact the type of room I had booked. Location is ok but the building work made room slightly noisy in the morning. It's around 20 mins walk from city centre, so quite well located, but I think there are likely better priced options closer to the centre.",3,2017,07,30
228,Great family hotel,"I booked this hotel mostly based on price and location. We were in Dublin for the U2 concert and visiting the city for the first time so I wanted something affordable yet centrally located so we could get where we needed to go without spending too much on taxis. The hotel was great. 

There are four of us--two tall teen boys in tow--and i wanted to be sure we weren't stacked on top of each other. I'd read reviews of the family room in this hotel and hoped it would live up to our expectations.  It did and then some!  Upon arrival, we were told it would be another hour before a room was ready--fine since it was well before scheduled check in.  

I'll pause the review here and note to first time overseas travelers from the US that flights arrive in the morning, but the hotels aren't always able to accommodate you until their scheduled checkin no matter how high priority you have in a rewards program. Getting angry at the hotel staff for this does no good and just adds to the reputation Americans have of being arrogant travelers. We saw this again upon arrival at this hotel--Americans angry that no room is available at 11 am. Checkin is clearly noted as 3 pm.   If your flight arrives at 6 am and you want to be in your hotel at 7 am you need to book it for the night prior.  If you cannot do that, then don't schedule a flight that arrives at 6 am.  Most hotels will store your bags for you while you explore, but admittedly that's a hard thing to do when you're jet-lagged.  Plan ahead.  

Now, back to the review--we left our bags and walked an easy 2 blocks to a pub for lunch and back again to have our room ready for us.  The family room consists of two queen beds and a single bathroom. But unlike US hotels, the queen beds were not side by side.  The room is an L-shape with one of the beds in an alcove on its own. There is plenty of nightstand and desk space in the room, a fridge and microwave, a safe, a large wardrobe and, unlike most European hotels, a large bathroom with a tub/shower combo.  We found plenty of outlets to charge our phones including in-wall USB which meant we didn't have to share the adapter.  The beds were super comfortable and the towels were good quality as well.  Unlike most European hotels, this one even included facecloths in the bath. For families like ours which two older teen boys or even for four adults traveling together this is a good set up because it doesn't feel quite so cramped.  

The hotel was undergoing construction to add A/C but they clearly stated that on the website and I didn't find it disruptive as the work was limited to daylight hours. 

I wouldn't characterize this hotel as charming and the neighborhood is not quaint--it's a main thoroughfare by the river, but it was reliably comfortable.  

Location was excellent for what we were doing--touring Dublin and seeing U2 at Croke Park. We could walk to Croke Park, and we certainly weren't alone in doing so. Joined by 20-30 thousand of our new friends, it was a safe and easy walk.  

The double-decker bus stops at the hotel--both green and yellow. We liked yellow.  Across the street from the hotel are the Dublin city-bikes which we used every day we were there.  For 5 euro you buy a 3-day pass and from there the cost of the bikes is minimal. I think for the entire time we were there, our family of four charge was a whopping 21 Euro!  We used the bikes to get to St. Stephen's Green and the Little Museum of Dublin (both awesome) and to ride up and down the Liffey.  

The food at the hotel restaurant was as good as anywhere else we ate in Dublin and the portions generous. 

The hotel staff was incredibly friendly.  

Ride time in a taxi from the airport = 20 minutes max. 

Ride time in the 747 Airlink from the airport = 30 minutes. 

To note:  we had a family of four so it was actually cheaper for us to take a taxi than to purchase the Airline tickets.  

All in all, I'd recommend this hotel to anyone traveling with a family who wants a reliable, practical place to stay in Dublin and isn't looking for a traditional Irish hotel or a specific neighborhood.  As it was the weekend, this area was not populated because it's near the financial district.  We shared the hotel mostly with other Americans who had traveled to see U2.",4,2017,07,29
228,Custom Weekend,"Was here because of U2 at Croke Park. Hotel perfectly situated. Side of the Liffey, stones throw from the stadium and O'Connell and Temple Bar. Train Station Hueston 10 minutes away, 747/747 bus from airport 12€ return stops outside, Taxi's constant order from reception but recommend the bus to transfer to airport if they run to your schedule.

The hotel is under renovation at the moment but although external scaffolding no real intrusion while staying. Conference room, gym, bar, restaurant etc all good . Costa Coffee inside as well. Staff courteous, quick to give information and happy to help with most of the things you need. In the foyer there is a machine to buy tickets for most of the attractions in Dublin.

Rooms spacious, mini bar on request, safe deposit box, hairdryer. Bed comfortable, shower large well equipped. 

Would stay again when in town.",4,2017,07,28
228,"Work in progress, but still a reasonably good experience","Just a single night in a twin room, river view. Room was newly refreshed, and a comfortable size. For sure the building work needs to be taken into consideration, particularly if you have arrived off a transatlantic flight and want some rest! As previously mention there is no aircon yet, this made it a little uncomfortable during the night.

Typically, the best part of this stay was the breakfast - certainly in line with or in some cases better than a normal Hilton breakfast which is hard to beat!

Would recommend it daf..",4,2017,07,27
228,Lovely weekend stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Beautifully clean room, with great view over the river. There was  fab choice at breakfast, really freindly and efficient staff on reception,in the restaurant and housekeeping. Yes there is renovation work going on but apart from the scaffolding you wouldn't know. The hotel is handy for the airport bus that stops right outside. Would definitely stay here again",5,2017,07,25
228,Good hotel,"Great location great staff really helpfull just a shame price went up due to concert apart from that as always great stay
Breakfast was good lots to chose from and rooms are very comfortable this was my 15 stay here over the years and I will return",5,2017,07,25
228,Amazing location and great people,"I arrived and immediately felt welcome by a friendly and customer focus lady in reception Soledad is her Name,, highly recommended hotel , personal service exceded my expectations. Soledad made my time at Hilton EXcetional and felt every time special.",5,2017,07,25
228,Over charging and poor service,"We booked this hotel although the price was hiked up as U2 were playing that night but we normally receive a good experience. As a regular Hilton user i was disappointed to find the price to be hiked so highly having paid around £125 a night in Orlando, Manchester and Leeds recently but this Hilton charged £299 per night. We contacted the hotel before confirming the booking and explained we had to be somewhere by 2pm could we check in earlier than the 3pm stated on line or we would have to book else where and we was told that they would do their best and it should not of be a problem. On arrival one member of staff could not of been more difficult, the First Lady was trying her best and was going to speak to house services but then a lady interrupted and took over and pointy blank said check in is at 3pm and nothing more could be done, it was only after complaining hard that they agreed to try and took our telephone number saying they would ring us when the room was ready and that they arranged a cleaner to go straight to our assigned room and repair it. After two hours we had received no phone call so rang the hotel and again the second lady who took our call was rude and and snapped that check in was not until 3pm, I reminded her that she had stated she had sent a cleaner to the room to prepaid it 2hrs previously. We got a call then 5mins later to say it was ready. 

Also our booking was removed from my name as a Hilton rewards member and changed to my wife's name removing the Hilton rewards number although she was only listed as a guest. Again the lady was adamant that this was my doing and not their mistake even when presented with an email of my confirmation from six months ago. 

Other things I found poor was the completely ridiculous costs of breakfast compared to other Hilton hotels, also as a Hilton member we have sometimes recieved nice little touches such as a free drink voucher or my kids have received warm cookies on arrival but this hotel offered nothing. Lastly no room service after 12am although we were allowed the use of a phone to order food to be deliver which we had to wait in reception to arrive. 

Also both the sink and toilet had hairs on them and a stripe of tooth paste was across the bathroom door but maybe that was my fault for rushing them to prepaid the room for us.",2,2017,07,25
228,Great Choice ,"I booked a room here recently for my parents to visit dublin. When booking I realised it was expensive but worth every penny. 
The hotel itself is clean, bright, in a great location and with a nice view of the river. 
I went to the hotel myself a couple of hours before my parents checked to ask if I could have them leave a bottle of prosecco in their room for them. The staff did this no problem and after just chatting to them and telling them the room was for my mama birthday they upgraded their room to a room with a view of the river at no extra cost. They also had the prosecco on ice with glasses in their room for when my parents arrived. Any staff member that I or my parents spoke to that weekend was incredibly friendly, chatty and polite. Really super! 
",5,2017,07,24
228,Quality Convenience and Good location for  onward travel.,The hotel is not a long drive to the cruise port and is within walking distance to the city. A bus stop is tight outside the front door so it is in an excellent position. The main dining room is huge so you are always guaranteed a seat. A smaller area of the main dining room is set aside in the evening for light dining and the food was magnificent.  Not a quaint hotel stay but it has wonderful staff and great service.,5,2017,07,23
228,Great Hotel for family vacation.,"Location, locaion location! very close to downtown and everywhere is within pretty much walking distance (10 minute walk to the Spire, 3 minute walk to George's Dock Luas station if you want to get to the west side of the downtown with ease) Airlink bus 747, 757 at the door step, it took only 20 minutes to the airport. The staff is above and beyond the standard, they are exceptional. Hotel appears very new, clean and well kept. Hilton Gold/Diamond gets free breakfast in Olys restaurant on the ground floor, which has very good selection of Irish breakfast and omelet bar, waffle machine. It has guest laundry facility within the property (EUR 6 for washing and drying, complimentary laundry detergent there), so you don't have to wander around the city and sit for hours for laundry.  I will recommend this hotel to friends or family who will visit Dublin in the near future. High recommended.",5,2017,07,23
228,Friendly accomodations in the Middle of Dublin,The staff at this hotel are the best. They are consistently working to make sure that your stay is enjoyable. The rooms are new and well appointed. The location is overlooking the River Liffy blocks from the Custom House. A comfortable hotel in the center of all activities in Dublin.,5,2017,07,22
228,Building site,Very high building noise starting on 8 am during work days. No air conditioner. No advice about this until arriving at hotel. Good breakfast (except fruit juices which taste very sour). Awful experience overall.,2,2017,07,19
228,One night stay,"Close to bus terminal 1 block away so very convenient. 15min from airport and 4 blocks away from O'connell  street  where there are many places to eat or shop.
Very good checkin and check out rooms very clean laundry machine a plus too. Only bad thing was room was a bit hot no air conditioning under repairs so a small fan was provided.  I would recommend this place and would come back myself.",4,2017,07,18
228,Great night sleep ,"After doing on line check in on arrival on a hot day I had a room with no air con. Not feeling very well I asked the front desk if they could change room. The lady apologised and moved me room.  

The room was very clean and ideal. The building work didn't impact as it is during day time. 

Location for work is great. This is much better hotel than the sister doubletree hotel by miles and in a better location 

Breakfast. I was surprised as normally breakfasts in garden inns are not great. This was very good. ",5,2017,07,18
228,Great stay in Dublin,Located close to all Dublin offers and staff make for a great stay. Enjoyed walking into Temple bar for the entertainment and to CBD for history and shopping. Walk across river to docks area filled with history and cafe scene exciting ,5,2017,07,17
228,Great Hotel in a Gereat Location,"This was an easy hotel to get to from the Airport. Although there is some construction going on it did not impact on our stay.  There is a parking building behind the hotel, which is great if you have a rental car.  We had to book two rooms as they did not have rooms according to their website that would fit families of 5 so I was a bit surprised to find that one of our rooms would have accommodated the whole family with a fold away bed.  Their rooms however were clean and modern with air conditioning. The breakfast was good as well. Friendly helpful staff and a guest laundry with a reasonable price per load was fantastic!",4,2017,07,14
228,Dublin adventure,"The hotel was a little difficult to get to because of construction, but once there we were glad to see our room was ready early. It was clean and modern. The hotel is being renovated, so there was some noise in the early afternoon. The staff was helpful with directions and suggestions for dining. We had late night dessert and breakfast in he restaurant and both were delicious.",5,2017,07,12
228,A MOST accommodating staff!,"The only negative I can share is that the hotel is undergoing a major renovation, BUT the end results will be central air conditioning in every room. SO a little bit of bad news is more than balanced by some great news post-renovation. Now onto the great stuff.

We arrived at this property at 6:45 AM after a long red-eye flight from the US East Coast. We were a party of 7 and had 3 rooms booked. I had asked our travel agent to request one room be ready for us to stash our luggage and for the kids to crash and we were ecstatic that one room was available for us. The front desk staff could not have been more friendly or accommodating to my family.

Rooms were not luxurious but we were not looking for luxurious. We were looking for a great location at a great price at a hotel which received great reviews and the Hilton Garden Inn nailed it on every front.

Breakfast was superb and since we had a Bed and Breakfast package we enjoyed a full hot breakfast each morning. Fresh omelets, fruit and pastries, yogurts, cereal, juices, etc. Really good breakfast!

Location is a 10 minutes from Temple Bar area if you choose to go to this tourist trap. 5 minutes from lots of great restaurants and pubs. Terrific central location.

I really appreciate our wonderful stay at your fine property. Keep up the great work!",5,2017,07,10
228,"Great Hotel, good location, AC issue during construction","This Hilton property met expectations during our trip to Dublin, Ireland.  This hotel is under construction, and not all rooms have air conditioning.  We tried a room without AC during the 1st night, however we were too hot and needed AC.  We spoke to the front deck, and some rooms were available on the first floor with AC.  We were able to switch.  Otherwise, its a great location, within a 10 minute walk to the hot Temple bar area, and 5 minute walk to the public transportation.",4,2017,07,10
228,Perfect location for a weekend away,"3 of us stayed here when we were away for a girls weekend.  It is very handy for the airport bus as the stop was just across the road (and just outside for going back).  The rooms were basic but what we expected, we really picked it for the location to the city centre.  I cant comment on the food in the place as we tended to eat out when we were there.  The staff were very friendly though and had no issue with storing our luggage as our flight wasnt till late on the Sunday night.",4,2017,07,10
228,Ok,"For the price, it was pretty routine.  Staff were nice.  I checked in digitally and they didn't know who I was when I arrived.  No AC - working on it though.  I would stay there again, but not for 220 euros.   Checkout was great - very helpful - opened the parking garage for us so I could get to the airport on time.",3,2017,07,09
228,Going to a concert and needed somewhere close by,"We previously stayed at this hotel when it was Jurys & enjoyed our stay but the rooms have changed unfortunately not for the better, the bed is much smaller and not the comfiest, also we could hear people next door. The bathroom is tiny and the lighting awful. The hotel is also still undergoing renovations which they do have signs in place about, this didn't disrupt our stay and they did have a fan in the room as the a/c is not working. 

The restaurant is still lovely and food is great along with breakfast. I don't know if we will stay again as we didn't get the best sleep. ",2,2017,07,09
228,Taken care of with a feeling of luxury,"From the first step in through the doors we were taken care of and got to feel important for our entire stay. 

Stepping into a beautiful lobby and being greeted within seconds from our entry.

The personnel were very nice and proactive; always asking if they could do us a service before we got the chance to ask of the same service ourself. Extremely courteous and always with a smile.

The room was spacious, had a nice tub and was kept extremely tidy from our check in to our check out. Big plus for a high quality hair-dryer and the fact that there was also a fridge. 

The complimentary wifi was fast and we did not experience any trouble with it. There were 30+ channels on the TV for our minibreaks during the day. In the middle of the day there was some noise from the renovation; but absolutely nothing that bothered us.

The bed was firm and very welcoming after a day of long walks through the beautiful city. The hotel is placed in the financial district and a close walk to both temple bar (~10min) and the very center of town (~15min to O'Connell Street lower). If one wants to take the LUAS tram, there are two stations just a couple of minutes away. The airport buses as well as the hop-on hop-off tourist buses also stop pretty much outside the door.

The breakfast buffet is good! Belgian waffles, omelette/scrambled eggs station, bread, bagels, some pastry and some fresh fruit as well as a full irish.

We were extremely happy with our stay and would definately go here again!",5,2017,07,09
228,Ok ,Location was convenient to Temple Bar and Trinity. Rooms were hot-no air conditioning. Food at restaurant was OK. Nothing special really but fine. We would definitely  choose another hotel for a future visit. ,3,2017,07,08
228,"Ice, coffee, hop-on bus","We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at the beginning of June. The location is great, especially if you like riding Hop-on buses. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfy, The best part of the hotel was the ice machine and cups that are available by the front desk. There is also coffee. We did eat in the hotels restaurant one night. It was just average. I would stay at this hotel again.",4,2017,07,07
228,AMAZING,"First off, I really enjoyed staying at the Hilton Custom House. This was my friend and I's final stop of our trip and the Hilton was a more luxurious than our previous stays. The bar/restaurant on the main floor is great for lunch or breakfast (definitely recommend the breakfast) and the location was easy for catching a taxi or walking to the sights. The only complain is the parking. You park the car in a structure right next to the hotel and you pay when you move the car. The hotel gives a discount on parking but it still ended up being a bit overkill with the charges. I wouldn't let this detract from the fact that this hotel is VERY nice...",5,2017,07,07
228,Noisy hotel,Booked in from July  3rd to 7th. Lovely room but::  Notice in rooms advising about refurbishments going on and state no noise between 10 am and 6pm. Well 2 mornings  awakened by drilling at 8-30 am and most mornings machines been started about 7-30 am. Could not have window open for the noise.  Pity they couldn't have told us about this before we booked ,2,2017,07,06
228,Very Chic,"Stayed just one night to attend a concert in the 02 Arena. This hotel is a great base for this, and a good location for exploring Dublin.
Had a beautiful family room with two double beds at the top of the hotel.
Not much interaction with the staff, had a few drinks in the bar, which was very pleasant.
Very enjoyable sleep in a very large bed and room, huge bathroom (strangely very empty- bit of wasted space?)
Wonderful view over Dublin City and to the Wicklow Mountains from our top floor room.
Breakfast was fine, help yourself buffet. Again, no real interaction with staff
The look of the hotel is just gorgeous. There is a business centre where you can use the computer and the printer, which was helpful for us. 
If you can get it for a good price, I would most certainly recommend",4,2017,07,04
228,Great location for a Dublin visit,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights before touring the rest of Ireland, and we'd definitely stay again. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. They gave us maps, which they circled with the destinations we wanted to visit, and they pointed out the best ways to get around, best places for certain types entertainment, and suggested additional spots to visit. Everything was within walking distance, for the most part, including 3Arena, Kilmainham Jail, and the Guinness and Jameson tours. The room was quite comfortable, also. Lovely stay and lovely staff. ",5,2017,07,03
228,"Bright green light in room, all night.","Dirty sheets (resolved well), bright emergency light illuminating entire room all night (not resolved at all - no attempt made by staff after they visited room.) Price was steep for basic business class hotel. I routinely get much more for less in other places in NA or the EU.",2,2017,07,03
228,Very poor meal in Olys restaurant,"Visited Olys restaurant yesterday after a match in Croke Park - very very disappointing. We waited 35 minutes food and my husbands chicken meal was so small I had to cook for him when we arrived home. We visited this restaurant last year and had a very good 2 course meal at a reasonable price. Alas, rip off Dublin is back! Would not go there again.",1,2017,07,03
228,Nice renovated room,"The hotel was undergoing major renovations but the work was carried out between 10am and 6pm so it didn't affect me. The hotel is located in the financial area about 10-15min walk along the Liffey River to O'Connell St or the Temple Bar area. You can take the Airlink 747 bus from the airport and it stops a few hundred metres from the hotel. 
My room on the first floor had been renovated and was excellent. Good size with large TV, fridge, safe and modern bathroom. Wi-Fi had good speed. 
I would've given it a 'excellent' rating except my room faced the major road along the river which has heavy traffic. Hence if you're a light sleeper I'd request a room on another side.",4,2017,07,02
228,"Poor customer service, small rooms","Staff made two errors in providing service, one could have meant we did not make our flight on time since they called us one hour later than we requested for our wake up call. Rooms are very small, my husband ran into the wall with mirror a few times.",3,2017,07,02
228,Lunch on Dublins Custo House Quay,"After a visit to Epic Ireland museum a group of us went next door to the Hilton Garden Inn ( formerly Jurys Inn )where we a very enjoyable 4 course lunch which we booked in advance . We were very well looked after by JP and friendly helpful staff . We were seated in a lovely comfortable location just off the main foyer . The food was excellent ,not a big meal but more than adequate for lunch and very modestly priced . Contact the restaurant manager Sushil should you wish to bring a group and you can be sure you will be welcomed by all .",4,2017,07,01
228,Hotel,"The Hilton Garden Customs House in Dublin, Ireland was a fabulous place to stay.  Right on the river Liffey it was close to the heart of Dublin.  The electric train was within walking distance. The hop-on/hop-off busses were just outside the door.  The included breakfast was great, staff went out of their way to help.",5,2017,07,01
228,Super stuffy rooms,They are installing A/C in this hotel. Do yourself a favor and wait until it is installed until you stay here. Even though it was relatively mild outside the room was uncomfortably stuffy and you couldn't leave the windows open because of the excessive road noise. Not a pleasant way to spend your vacation. ,3,2017,06,30
228,Excellent hotel in a great location,"Arrived at 8:00 in the morning and didn't expect a room at that time.  Not only did we get a a room, we got one on the second floor that had the AC renovation completed.  The room is a normal North American size room that is very well appointed.  The bed was very comfortable.  The room included a safe, iron, ironing board and the bath towels were of a very good quality.  Our room included a hot breakfast buffet that was excellent.  The hotel has a bar and restaurant which is nice.  Staff were helpful and very courteous.  Location is central and there is a bus stop right outside the front door.  Our stay was great and we would stay again if in Dublin.",5,2017,06,29
228,simply the best,"stayed here for Phil Collins gig and ate in Ollie's bar/rezzy too, the rooms were clean warm and well serviced maintained, right by the river so ask for a front facing room you see all of dublin city then, would recommend and stay again.",5,2017,06,29
228,Modern Hilton that offers all you'd expect,Spent two nights here in a standard room which was perfectly acceptable as I didn't spend long in it. Although the hotel is pretty modern (I'd say less than 10 years old) it's currently being extended to add 80 bedrooms and at the same time air con is being added to all of the rooms which will obviously be of benefit when it's hot (it wasn't!). Bed comfortable and linen and pillows all decent. Wifi as good as any Hilton I've stayed in recently. Typical Hilton breakfast buffet with no surprises and food kept warmer than many buffets I've had to suffer. Reception staff efficient if not overly friendly. No complaints. Second time I've stayed there and would do so again,4,2017,06,29
228,Good value,"Being located near the Custom House, it's slightly outside of the tourist area. It took about 15 mins' walk to Trinity College, then 20 mins to Temple Bar area. The pedestrian ways are well planned, so it was no problem for us. The airport bus #747 stops almost in front of the hotel, and it took less than 30 mins to get to the hotel. 

Rooms were well-equipped with double windows, so we really had a good night sleep. The complimentary wifi (for HHonour members) had a strong signal, and we benefited a lot from it. As advertised in its website, the Hotel is undergoing a major expansion/renovation, henceforth the building was completely scaffolded. We only spent one night, and we were already gone when the work started at 10 am on Saturday.   

For the price, we got a good deal through the Hilton's website - better than rates that other companies advertised.  ",4,2017,06,27
228,Fantastic weekend break.,"What can I say, Hilton is the way to run a hotel. Fantastic room, staff were so friendly, food incredible. Would recommend this hotel to anyone, very central to all the town and within easy walking distance to most attractions. Also has great views over the river. Fantastic stay and I will be back.",5,2017,06,26
228,Excellent value for money and very helpful staff,"Although the hotel is adding an extra floor on the top and is covered in scaffolding this did not disturb on our stay on the first floor, where new air-conditioning had already been installed. The rooms are well-appointed and the beds very comfortable. Breakfast choices and quality are excellent. The staff are most helpful. Overall good value for money. although the hotel is not in the heart of Dublin it is in walking distance of the centre of Dublin and the airport bus stops right outside.",5,2017,06,25
228,perfect location,"Stayed for one night only but I was very impressed with the hotel. Check in was complete in a matter of seconds, rooms were spotless clean, large bathroom and very comfortable bed. Large flat screen tv with lots of channels available. Tea and coffeee maker in your room. I did eat in the bar/ restaurant and the traditional fish and chips I had were excellent.
The hotel is only 2 minute walk to the LUAS red line station Mayors square. Lots of bars, places to eat and supermarkets very close by also. Hotel offers free high speed Wi-Fi.
Highly recommended.",5,2017,06,25
228,Lovely place to stay,"눇In Dublin for the one Friday night , hotel and parking were easy to find via the tunnel. Great location , Patricia on reception was very helpful and gave us an early check-in ( we needed to change clothes as we were attending Graduation at TCD ). The room was spotless and the generously sized beds very comfortable. All the staff we met were polite and friendly. We weren't troubled by building noise at all. Would happily stay again.",5,2017,06,25
228,Lovely hotel,"Had a lovely 2night stay in the hilton last weekend. Our room wasnt ready when we checked in so we got two complimentary drinks in the bar which was a lovely gesture.We ate in the restaurant on our first night.,food was delicious. The rooms are clean and modern. The hotel is in a great location,its 5minute walk from the bus station,We attended a concert in the aviva,which is about a 20minute walk,and its close to temple bar area. ",5,2017,06,24
228,Great Value,"Located in a Nice clean part of the city.  Renovated guest rooms were great.  Nice views of the river.  Great Breakfast, friendly restaurant and front desk staff.  Dont hesitate to recommend to friends or family.",5,2017,06,24
228,"does not reach the standard, tiny bathroom","In Dublin, I stayed in three different hotels, this one, the Hilton Inn Garden , and the Amberley GuestHouse ( this latter being a trap, to be avoided at all costs). I rank the Clayton Burlington first for its location and service. The Hilton In  was disappointing as it does not reach the Hilton standard , especially the bathroom was tiny with a plastic curtain, this kind one only find in low cost hotels. The quay/street is noisy, cannot sleep the window ajar.The breakfast buffet is really good with special omelettes. Reception Staff could be a little familiar, but it is the Irish style, still friendly.",2,2017,06,24
228,Group holiday in Dublin Ireland,excellent location for restaurants museums and shopping. Great staff and excellent breakfast buffet. Beautiful hotel is adding a/c for added comfort. Tour buses and Hop On Hop Off bus stops here. Great deli and coffee shops near,5,2017,06,23
228,Wait until renovations,Stayed 4 nights. Room very stuffy. Awoken every morning by workman. Whilst is was a lovely hotel I wouldn't return until all the renovations have been carried. I know they state that on their website but I don't think their prices reflect it. Breakfast was good value and the staff were excellent. Very central and handy for 3Areana. Its was just the renovations that left me disappointed.,3,2017,06,23
228,Good two night stay,"Stay in May with two teenagers, who were attending a concert. I was a bit troubled with the amount of work that was being done to the hotel but work didn't start till after 10 am (well until they had their breakfast at 10, with the customers which didn't look good) wasn't impressed with that as your paying €14 for breakfast and eating with the workmen. The breakfast was good with plenty to choose from and have omelette's freshly made. The room was comfortable, with a fridge, iron slow close doors but no aircon which it needed but did have a fan which we used. 
All in all was a good stay not fantastic but good.",4,2017,06,23
228,Not recommended,The hotel is undergoing renovation which is an endurance test for their patrons. There is no air conditioning so you have to open a window for air and we were right over the busy street with noise and fumes. There was one day where the hotel had no water at all and on our last day there was no hot water as we were trying to shower and leave for an early flight; just not good enough. The friendly and helpful staff are the only redeeming feature of this hotel who handled our concerns with compassion and compensation but until this renovation is completed I cannot recommend it to others.,2,2017,06,19
228,Robbie Concert weekend !!,"Absolutely brilliant hotel ..... Arrived here on a Friday at  lunchtime we where prepared to leave our cases at reception couldn't believe our rooms where ALL ready !! 
Food was excellent and every member of staff from the reception to the room attendants to the bar staff  etc where very friendly and helpful !! Was a great weekend .",5,2017,06,18
228,Will Never Stay Again - CONSTRUCTION WORKS & LOUD DRILLING ONGOING!!,"Absolute disgrace – I called the hotel twice before my stay, once the day before to confirm my booking and card details – and on the morning of my stay to confirm the location of the nearby car park. They failed to tell me during any of these phone calls that there was substantial construction works ongoing both around the full perimeter and within the hotel itself. The air conditioning was also switched off due to these works.
My wife and I were rudely awoken at 6AM!! By extremely load drilling which was constant with no let-up at all – it was an absolute disgrace and I would niot have stayed there if I knew what I was in for – thank god it was just the 1 night!! The staff were also extremely  rude and just had an attitude of ‘you should just get on with it’. I was fuming – it was the 1st night away for my wife and I since we had our baby 5 months ago and were were hoping for a badly needed sleep in!.

I will never ever stay in this hotel again and I highly recommend that ANYONE WHO HAS BOOKED THIS HOTEL OVER THE NEXT 3-4 MONTHS SHOULD DEFINITELY CANCEL AND REBOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE DUE TJO THE DISGRACEFUL DISRUPTION & DISOMFORT CAUSED BY THE CONSTRUCTION WORKS!",1,2017,06,17
228,Fantastic stay,"We visited and stayed 2 nights in June for our 12th yr wedding anniversary. 

When we arrived our room was ready. We have a lovely comfortable room, a lovely touch from the hotel was that they left us a lovely card and chocolates in our room, wishing us a happy anniversary 

Breakfast was really tasty, lots of different choices on offer. 

Staff were very helpful throughout our stay. 

I would highly recommend this hotel ",5,2017,06,13
228,Great hotel near the centre of Dublin,Lovely clean hotel with a really comfortable bed and blackout curtains meant I slept really well. Nice quote location but easy walking distance to Temple Bar area. Some nice cafes really close and the bus to the airport stops right outside the hotel!,4,2017,06,13
228,Excellent facility,"My family traveling with us to a total of 12, enjoyed our stay at this facility overall.  The service, staff, meals were well above normal into excellent.  The wi-fi was excellent with no breaks along with the meals as exceptional.  We believe you will have a great experience and will confirm our experience too.",5,2017,06,13
228,Hilton is always great,The hotel and staff are nice.  The front desk people were kind and welcoming. The restaurant staff and bartenders were fun. They were all very helpful with anything we needed.  We walked and took the bus all over the city.  They need Airconditioning but that will be finished shortly.  I would stay here again.  ,5,2017,06,12
228,Hilton - always fabulous hotel,"Just back from two days staying here and it was fabulous.. the location is great for public transport links and walking distance from the 3arena.. airlink bus stop is outside. 
Breakfast is buffet style with loads of delicious choice.. full Irish, continental with the most delicious coffee., 
We attended a concert and too late to have food but given a takeaway menu snd pizza delivered to hotel.. excellent customer service!!! Would recommend anyone traveling to Dublin to stay at this great hotel 

",5,2017,06,12
228,Handy for the Point,"We stayed here for one night to attend a concert at the Point. Very handy, only a 10 or 15 minute walk. It's overlooking the Liffey, but away from the hustle & bustle...which is nice.

The hotel is clean & bright. The staff were really pleasant at reception. Our room didn't have much of a view (a courtyard with work being done) but that's not what we were there for! However it was really clean, spacious and comfy! Very comfy bed.

Breakfast was included and was very nice. The only small downfall I thought was that there was only coffee from machines, rather than the usual hotel breakfast fresh filter coffee. Machine coffee is just not the same!

A very nice place to stay that won't break the budget.",4,2017,06,12
228,Convenient for 3 Arena and IFSC ,"Located along the quays makes it a perfect base if attending a show in 3 Arena, Convention Centre Dublin or the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. There are several car parks nearby with one beside the hotel. The luas runs on a street at the rear of hotel. Rooms are comfortable with a safe, tea/coffee facilities, alarm clock and usb cables are a nice touch. Access to the lift and stairs requires a room key, thereby providing extra security. Lots of building work underway presently, it didn't impact on our stay. ",4,2017,06,11
228,One night stay,This is a great hotel. Would definitely recommend it to family and friends. It's in a great place. Breakfast was great. Even though it's in a busy place and we had a room to the front it was really quiet. ,5,2017,06,11
228,Good location and great staff!,"First visit to Ireland and this was a great hotel. Central location and easy walking distance to all the action and transportation interchange. I arrived and there was an issue with my booking - room was not available for the first night I arrived (unfortunately). I was advised that I had a reservation at a nearby hotel and could check in the next day, and the hotel paid for a taxi to the new hotel and my return to the Hilton - I didn't have to organise anything which was great after 24+ hours travelling from Australia. The manager (female, unfortunately I can't remember her name!) was very apologetic and upon my return the next day she offered me complementary breakfast for the remainder of my stay (4 nights) and another meal in the restaurant. I felt welll taken care of and al the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would stay again in a heart beat and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to all!",5,2017,06,11
228,Great hotel near central Dublin highlights,"Recently took a large group of college students to Dublin, and this was an ideal location. Quick access to all of central Dublin, including Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, and Trinity College. Despite being on a main road the hotel is very quiet inside. Rooms are neat and tidy, elevators large enough to accommodate crowds. The front desk staff are quite helpful. Very good cooked full Irish breakfast with a to-order omelet station. There was construction noise, but not until after 8 a.m. and not after 6 p.m.",5,2017,06,11
228,Nice Hotel in Dublin,"Located just outside of the city center, this hotel was worth the value.  The front desk staff is exceptional and happy to help with the simplest questions and great suggestions. We had a family room for 3 people and the room was a nice size. We did not feel crowded. I would definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2017,06,11
228,Pros and Cons,"I stayed here two nights while on an organized tour. 
Pros - location is on the river and very walkable to the city center where all the action is. I am a slow walker and it probable took 20 minutes to get to the Trinity College area. Although there is a lot of traffic and construction Dublin is an easy city to navigate 

There is a Luas station, Georges Dock, right behind the hotel. 2.00 will take you where you want to go along the route. Ticket machines are easy.

The hotel is under construction but I did not hear any noise at all from it.

Front desk staff and cleaning staff are friendly and helpful. Our rooms were ready early - much appreciated after the long flight 

Breakfast is very goof. Omelettes made to order and a variety to choose from

The reception area is bright and comfortable; the elevators are fast. I liked that you have to use your key card to access the elevator

Room with king bed was a decent size 

Water and other snacks are available for purchase

Shower pressure is excellent

WIFI is good

Cons - This is in a business section so no real stores/shops right in the immediate area

Mattress was hard as a rock

Room was very warm and I couldn't figure out the fan (?) operation although there is a fan in the closet.

My toilet ran continuously even though I told the front desk three times it was not fixed 

Walls are thin I could hear the neighbors alarm go off",3,2017,06,11
228,"There's some construction, but very nice overall","There was construction going on, but it hardly bothered me because I was out of the room at the time of the noise touring the city. The rooms are standard Garden Inn...nothing special, but clean. The front desk was extremely helpful. Location is a bit away from the tourist attractions, which may be a plus. I enjoyed my visit.",4,2017,06,10
228,Perfect Hotel & Location ,"Great hotel in a great location , a little off the beaten track which is just what we needed. 10 min walk to Temple Bar and main shopping area. The breakfast Buffet was outstanding and set us up for the day ",5,2017,06,08
228,"Good location, great staff, will be better when remodelling finished","I was looking for a last minute booking in Dublin and this was just over the river from the office so a perfect location.

I'm not sure it was worth the full price but the staff were great and friendly, the entire place very clean and the rooms pretty good. Very clean inside.

The is a large renovation project going on and it is a bit noisy in the day but then again on a business trip that wasn't a problem for me. But overnight it was perfectly quiet.

Can't fault them for that.. and I can't really fault them on the fact I had to pay full price but every hotel in Dublin was the same.

If I can book in advance and get a better rate I will be back for sure.. and to be fair for convenience I might be back anyway whatever the price.",4,2017,06,08
228,Great service,"Hotel employees were lovely - very, very helpful and thoughtful. Enabled us to check-in early (important after a long international flight) and arranged to put our two rooms near each other, without us needing to request. Room is a very nice size in comparison to other large metropolitan European cities.",4,2017,06,08
228,Disruptive construction. It is disgraceful Hilton charges full prices during highly annoying construction.,Very disruptive stay. Construction highly intrusive. Very noisy. Water quality and pressure terrible. Do not stay here. It is disgraceful Hilton charges these prices during intrusive construction. Shame,1,2017,06,06
228,Great location,"We had a short stay in June 2017.
The staff were courteous and attentive, very professional.
The room was clean and spacious.
We were overlooking the river Liffey.
There was a TV with freeview. A hairdryer, Iron & ironing board. USB charging points.
The breakfast was buffet style with full English, continental, fruit, waffle maker, tea, coffee & juices.
There was some renovation work being carried out,but apart from the scaffolding outside you didn't notice.
The hotel is situated on the in the centre of the city on the river Liffey.
There is a bus stop outside the hotel.",5,2017,06,06
228,Nice Hotel,"Hotel is situated right on the river Liffey and is about 20 minutes walk to Temple Bar. 

The room was quite hot at night but there is work ongoing to install air con. Was woken up at lot in the night by other people's doors slamming shut!

Decent breakfast, plenty of options and they had both white and black pudding! The Mrs was made up with the waffle maker!

The bus to the airport stops right outside the hotel and cost 7€ per journey.

Staff friendly and polite.",4,2017,06,05
228,Renovations are Annoying,"The hotel is well situated and things will be better when the renovations are complete but it was noisy and awkward during my stay. Otherwise, I don't like that every room in the hotel has 2 beds. When on one's own, the second bed takes up a lot of room and provides no value in return. the restaurant is indifferent with a breakfast not worth the price, but there is a good coffee stand at the end of bar for a continental breakfast. 
The staff are helpful and positive but it was not a great hotel experience.",3,2017,06,04
228,Easy walk to financial centre or tourist attractions,"Wonderful breakfast, quiet rooms, and a guest laundry, which is VERY hard to find in Dublin. The front desk staff were extremely helpful . Being right by the river, there are pleasant walking or running opportunities.",5,2017,06,04
228,Noisy rooms,"I have nothing bad to say about the hotel itself. The staff was really friendly. The rooms were nice and clean, but my biggest issue was the noise. There was some type of construction or remodeling going on, so there were always construction noise. Make sure when you book the hotel to ask, if they have finished remodeling. I would never stay there, if I knew they were remodeling.",1,2017,06,03
228,Never again,This is a building site.  Definitely unsuitable for anyone elderly.  We were not warned that there would be drilling and banging at various times.  We were not warned that access from the car park next door had been blocked off meaning a long walk with bags.  We were not warned until we got to our room that water would be turned off in the afternoons and one evening we were unable to use the bathroom or even wash hands before going out.  Staff were as helpful as anyone could be but they should not be subjected to this experience either.  Negotiated fair charge before leaving.,1,2017,06,03
228,Nothing less than the perfection expected with the Hilton name,"With a bus stop right in front of the hotel we were able to take the 747 buss to/from the airport.  While it is a few blocks walk to the more touristy areas of Dublin the location is good and the area is quiet.  The rooms were immaculate.  The air conditioning was really good, you could store food in the room if you wanted.  Plenty of outlets for charging numerous electronic devices and ample closet and drawer space.  The bathroom was a bit small by US standards but very well organized and ultra modern.  We stayed on the 1st floor (2nd floor in the USA) which allowed us to use the stairs as well as the elevators.  There is a restaurant on site and I highly recommend the breakfast buffet, great Irish Breakfast with lots of extras.  We ate lunch there as well one day, the seafood chowder was amazing.  Will use this place again on my next visit.",5,2017,05,31
228,"Nice, but there is a huge question mark ","A nice hotel with friendly and efficient staff.
The breakfast is excellent, my dinner on the other hand; not that impressive. 
There is a question of cleaning even though the hotel seems very tidy. When going to bed I soon realized that someone had urinated in it. A shower later and with efficient help from the hotel staff I had a new room. I was compensated later with dinner and drinks. When bad things happened the staff handled it professionally.

Although, it leave on question unanswered does it not?
Do they really change sheets between guests? Or do they just stretch them and hope for the best?",2,2017,05,29
228,Good Dublin Hotel,"The staff here is excellent and the rooms are clean and updated. The food from the canteen is a bit spendy. The location of this hotel is good. The Dublin Airport 747/757 has a stop right out front. The area is quiet, so plan your meals. If you want good Dublin Pub food you have to do some hiking.",5,2017,05,29
228,Not at Hilton's standard yet,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights on a vacation. The hotel does not have air conditioning and despite opening the window and using the desk fan they provided in the room, it was still very hot (having a default desk fan in the room was a bad signal). The street out front is quite busy and occasionally (because you have to open the window) you get the exhaust from passing buses coming into your room and the chatter of passerby can wake you up at night. The hotel is under construction as they are adding rooms and air conditioning, so hopefully these problems will go away with time. However, I would have expected Hilton to complete the construction after they bought the property but before opening it as a Garden Inn. Overall, the hotel was tastefully decorated with modern elements. The guest rooms were a standard size and reasonably furnished. The bed was very firm, which resulted in poor sleep most nights. Overall, if I had to do it again, I would go elsewhere.",2,2017,05,28
228,Overpriced,"I should start this with the fact that I knew there was going to be construction while we were there.  That being said, I feel like the hotel could have done more to keep us away from the construction area (adjacent to the room we stayed in).  Most of the noise didn't get going until 10 AM, but forget that post-lunch/pint of Guinness nap.  

At over $200 per night, not worth it.  ",3,2017,05,27
228,Great hotel and location,"Perfect location on River Liffey, great spot for easy walking to hotspots in the city.  Staff were all very helpful and the buffet full Irish breakfast was just like it had been made to order.  Definitely would stay here again!",5,2017,05,27
228,Overnight stay,When I arrived outside the hotel I realised this hotel was jury's inn when stayed here 7 years ago. The first impression was good the room was modern as this hotel was refurbished recently. I used the gym which had few equipments to use to keep up the fitness while away from home. I was very impressed with the business facilities where you can access internet and print out any documents. All staff at the hotel were very friendly. ,5,2017,05,26
228,"Great value, nice staff","I stayed here during a conference. The location is ideal. Right by the Liffey River, walking distance to everything fun. Bus line just outside the door. Trains close by. The hotel is clean, nicely updated, and comfortable. This isn't an overly fancy hotel, but it certainly is nice and very functional. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2017,05,26
228,Few nights in Dublin,"Excellent location and Very helpful staff. Breakfast was very good with a variety of food to choose. Complimentary internet was slightly shakey, but I'm just being picky. Very close to the waterfront, and many restaurants. If i am visiting again i will certainly stay here again.",5,2017,05,25
228,A very enjoyable stay at a well located hotel undergoing renovation.,"The hotel is located in a desirable area of Dublin near many of the newly constructed buildings around the waterfront and is close to the theater where concerts are held.  If $$$ is not a factor, then the Marker Hotel nearby is the place to stay.  But if your thoughtful about spending $ (yours or your company's), then this Hilton is a much better place for you.  Comfortable, clean, wonderful staff, and reasonable price makes staying at this Hilton property an intelligent decision.",4,2017,05,24
228,Weekend away,"This hotel was lovely. The room was clean and comfortable. We booked a twin room bjt there weren't any available. This wasn't really an issue though and the bed was really comfortable. 
We didn't have breakfast included so we paid for it on the morning. It was 14 euros. On reflection we wouldn't have done this as there seemed to be plenty of places to eat breakfast which were much better value.
The hotel is under renovation but this did not impact on our stay at all.
Overall this was a lovely hotel, good location and I would stay here again.",4,2017,05,24
228,Hilton 5 stars!!!!!,"Excellent location and Very helpful staff. Breakfast was very good with a variety of food to choose. Complimentary internet was excellent. Our stay was a very good one. If asked, I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,05,24
228,Bank holiday Visit,"Arrived with sister and niece. We had pre checked into the room via the app. On arrival there was a offer for breakfast which we availed off. Hotel is in a great location 5 mins walk from Connolly station. bar area downstairs isn't massive. Feels a bit like sitting in lobby. But the restaurant area looks nice. We didn't eat here in the evenings. 
Room was brilliant. two beds. Not full doubles I don't think. But still the size of the room we had was great. Couldn't fault it. Even had a fridge in the room which is great for kids drinks etc. The windows are double glazed so even being on a busy road on the night of a concert we didn't hear anything. 
Breakfast was great as well. Handmade waffles, fresh omelets . Pached eggs at request. I couldn't fault it. 

One downside is that there is no entry to the car park from hotel. but this is very minor. nothing major that I can fault.",5,2017,05,23
228,Almost perfect!,"As a group, we booked three rooms. The check in was efficient and although we were early and knew our rooms would not be ready the staff did their very best to get us in as soon as possible. The one thing we wanted was a quiet room. The room was very comfortable and we would definitely recommend and stay here again. However, out of the three rooms we have the noisiest. there seemed to be a problem with the bathroom room pipes above us and every time the person above used the bathroom the noise in our room was awful - especially at 4am!!!
The rest of the stay was great though and we would try it again. The restaurant was also very good.  One other small point... and all three couples commented on it.. the young man on the reception desk was anything but clean!",4,2017,05,23
228,Great hotel - friendly and great location,We enjoyed our stay here. The front desk (especially Vlasta and Patricia) are friendly and helpful. Rooms are nice and clean. Food in the dining room - excellent. We had breakfast every day. The hotel is in a great location to everything.,5,2017,05,22
228,Way too noisy ,"The hotel is currently under construction and one part of the hotel has more going on than the other, unfortunately for us we were in room 312 and we were right next to the extension being built. There was a notice in our room saying there might be noise between 10am and 6pm. It started at 8:30am. There was no relaxing lie in for us. It was so loud. I felt so irritated and could not wait to check out. We stayed only one night but would not have stayed any more than that. I understand it's a business and the hotel needs to make money but putting people in rooms right next to that kind of noise is disgraceful and we had no prior warning. We did complain and received an email apologising and a discounted rate the next time we book with them but that's not much good as I would not stay again.

Staff were very nice and apologetic. I felt sorry for them as I would say they are sick of hearing the complaints and it's not their fault to be fair to them. 

Breakfast is very good and other than the awful drilling, hammering and jack hammering the hotel is very nice, clean and comfortable and good location for 3arena and walking distance into town. ",2,2017,05,19
228,Just The Facts,"Pros- 1 American outlet and 2 USB outlets in my room.
          Convenient for the Game of Thrones Tour (and the reason we stayed there)
          Large offering for breakfast
          Good size room
          Restaurant staff very friendly        

Cons- Car park was a nightmare to use
           NO AC! 
           Windows opened to loud traffic & bus exhaust. 
           Exterior scaffolding knocked on our wall all night
           Previous 3 led to sleepless nights
           Dinner in restaurant was expensive and tasteless",3,2017,05,19
228,Barely noticed that builders are on site,"The hotel is being extended, as the management were at pains to apologise for in advance. But no work is done outside hours, and apart from the scaffolding on the outside, I was barely aware that the hotel was being worked on. Room was comfortable, well appointed, clean, and quiet; breakfast and service good. What more could I have wanted, passing through the city?",4,2017,05,19
228,Hilton should be ashamed of themselves!,"Extremely disappointed to discover that Hilton is more interested in revenue than their customer satisfaction.  It should be illegal for hotels to stay open when they are under such major construction.  The hotel staff were just lovely people and couldn't have been more apologetic.  Unfortunately, that didn't make up for the fact that we had to listen to a jack hammer DIRECTLY over our room between 9 am - 6 pm, that there was no climate control in the rooms or that the water was turned off between 12p -5 pm one day.  I'm disgusted with the Hilton brand and am done with being an honors member.  This is not a brand I will support in the future.",2,2017,05,17
228,"Really handy for shopping, shows and 3 Arena",Stayed here when going to a concert in 3 Arena which is close-by. There is some construction work going on at the moment but we were well warned about it before we went but to be honest  if it wasn't for  the scaffolding outside the building we wouldn't have noticed. Lovely rooms and a great welcome. Nice bar and restaurant and don't miss the Waffle bar and Omelette station at Breakfast! There was also a small fridge in the room and a safe which we found really handy. Big Comfortable beds and a large TV top it all off. There is paid parking at the rear at a reduced rate of €18.00 per day so factor that in if comparing costs. 10 minute walk to Temple Bar and O'Connell Street. Would recommend and would happily stay again.,5,2017,05,17
228,Under construction,"I was disappointed in this hotel. I thought that it would be a lot nicer for the price. It's under construction and I'm on the back side of the hotel so my view is that of storage pods and dumpsters. My bed is very uncomfortable. I'm glad that I'll only be here two nights. The toilet runs and after while I can get it to stop and then in the middle of the night it starts to run again. To be fair, they do have a sign that says they want you to be happy and just let them know if your not pleased. So it's probably my fault that I haven't asked them to change my room.",3,2017,05,14
228,Reasonably priced and good room,"Found this hotel reasonably priced compared to some Dublin City Hotels. Rooms had everything we needed and were clean and comfortable. Didn't eat in Hotel. Check in and check out friendly and efficient. Location bit further to City than used to, but 10 / 15 minutes had us in Temple Bar area.",4,2017,05,10
228,Under Construction - But not nice,"We stayed here for business/Pleasure for a few days and overall, the location is close to everything but not congested. The hotel rooms are nice but they are in middle of a large renovation on the AC and in adding additional rooms. Our stay was nice overall and the staff was very friendly. It was a lot cheaper to stay here than to stay just a few blocks close to temple bar district. For how close it still is (10 minute walk), it's not worth the extra money to stay near temple bar or dublin college.",4,2017,05,10
228,Great Location,"Traveled to Dublin on St. Patrick's Day weekend. Great location to the major places in Dublin and close to the airport bus shuttle stop.

Nice rooms and has everything you need. The breakfast was delicious.

Would stay again if I'm back in Dublin again.",4,2017,05,07
228,Excellent choice,"Stayed here with my family for a concert at the 3 Arena and it was a great choice. Excellent location, convenient parking, clean and modern rooms and public areas. The breakfast choice and quality was superb and all staff were professional and friendly. 

Highly recommended. ",5,2017,05,07
228,Great Hotel and Great Location ,The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House even during renovation (hotel is adding air conditioning units in all rooms). The hotel is easy to get to from the airport by bus the stop is in front of the hotel. The room was very nice and comfortable even with an extra roll away bed in the room. The lobby is bright and inviting the staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast downstairs was really good with the normal food items we all expect to see with a few Irish dishes to round out your options. We easily navigated the city from this location. This is a hotel I plan on visiting again in the future...,4,2017,05,07
228,HOTEL UNDER EXTREME RENOVATION,Hotel covered in scaffolding as under huge renovations and the noise is relentless throughout he hotel.  Changed rooms but to no avail the noise was everywhere.  I would not stay here again at this hotel until they have completed the renovations which is at the end of 2017.  In my opinion hotel should have been closed whilst such extreme renovations are taking place.,2,2017,05,06
228,Best hotel to stay in,If you are going to a concert in the 3arena stay in this hotel as it is in walking distance of about 5 mins O'Connell street and 15 mins to the 3arena and the hotel has a great staff and the rooms are fantastic ,5,2017,05,04
228,Kinda Pricey but Very Comfortable,"I stayed at the Hilton Inn over the weekend with my partner and we were willing to splash out a little for a good hotel in a good location, and the Hilton Inn delivered on both fronts (nice room and super comfy bed and a 10 minute walk to the Temple Bar District).
It was a little cheaper than normal due to the construction work being done on the hotel but as we were gone for most of the day it didn't affect us at all (construction is done between 9-6ish from memory), except slightly obscuring our view of the river.
Breakfast wasn't included in the price but we ended up paying €12 for it the night before and it was well worth doing.
For the reduced price this is a hotel definitely worth considering.",4,2017,05,03
228,hearty greeting,The staffs are very kind and I feel personal touch everywhere. The room was clean and comfortable. Even no air conditioned. Very convenient to visit Convention Center and good walking distance to the town. Restaurant is also very nice. Comfortable and not so expensive.,5,2017,05,03
228,Dublin Weekend,Great hotel to stay in close enough to walk into Dublin centre.  Room was clean and spacious.  Hotel looked like new.  We were warned that work was being carried out in advance of our stay but to be honest apart from the scaffolding around the outside you wouldn't know didn't affect us at all.  Very impressed with breakfast and had a meal in the restaurant which was gorgeous.,5,2017,05,02
228,Could be better.,Stayed here many times when the hotel was owned by Jurys and have to say I was a bit disappointed. Room rates are much more expensive. Bags of laundry left in corridor. Expensive parking next door €18 overnight used to be €10-€12. ,3,2017,05,01
228,Plesent stay in Hilton Garden Inn in Dublin,"About the fact that Dublin is characterized by friendly atmosphere and kindness for outsiders I knew from friends' stories. However, personal experience from the moment I arrived in the city exceeded my expectations. Did not find out otherwise when staying at the hotel. First of all patience and assistance in accommodation was very nice. Always staying in the Hilton Garden Inn area, I felt discreet to cover the help, in rare ways not like the aggressive desire to help as in other hotels.",5,2017,04,29
228,"Good location, in the heart of city centre","Usually when I travel, I try and stay at Hilton brand hotels. Loyalty to one brand has proven to be a good thing. The Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Customs House is a nice hotel. Built inside an old building, the hotel is clean and nicely remodeled. The room I was in featured a nice view of the river. Although not all rooms have river views. The staff was friendly and the location was great. I took a taxi from the airport, (about 20 min ride with traffic) and explored the city center on foot. Overall an excellent place to make your temporary home in Dublin. 
",5,2017,04,28
228,"Good location, comfortable and on bus route from airport","Great location, comfortable hotel, currently undergoing renovations but these were not intrusive. Excellent service in the bar and at the front desk. Good range of choices at breakfast, with well prepared hot food",4,2017,04,27
228,Nice clean and peaceful,"better stay experience, helpful staff. bathrooms are clean and very well. Bed and breakfast is the best one. Just that you will not find beer bottle openers in the room, you need to walk-down to bar for opening one. I stayed 27 nights, all good. I will recommend this hotel",4,2017,04,27
228,Good hotel ,"Good hotel, had a good breakfast and good seating options to get some work done with a drink at the lobby/ bar. If you have business in the dock area its a good location with plenty of dinner options nearby. Rooms are okay and they are well insulated from the streetnoise. One downer for me was a group of restaurant customers one night that where way to rauwdy clearly over the drinking limit. To be far the staff did offer apologies afterward. If you like a morning stroll there's a nice short boulevard just across the street. Overall good experience ill be back.",3,2017,04,27
228,Great Hotel in Dublin.,"The Hilton was a luxurious stay for us. The beds were comfy, the rooms were clean and the staff were friendly. The restaurant in the lobby of the hotel serves amazing food and would recommend to anyone staying close by.

The hotel also boasted the convenience of a laundry, so we could wash our clothes as to be fully prepared for our next destinations.

The wi-fi in this hotel was the quickest we encountered in all our hotels.",5,2017,04,24
228,"Good hotel, good location","A bit small in terms of room size.  However, it was very inexpensive and a short walk from the action of downtown Dublin.  Check in was efficient and helpful.  If you arena n a budget this is a very good option!",4,2017,04,23
228,Very Noisy ,"Stayed here a few weeks back for a concert in Dublin.. lovely hotel efficient check in and room was very nice. However, if you want any kind of a lie in I would NOT recommend this hotel.. was awakened early in the morning by a loud horrible noise (the hotel is undergoing renovations) outside my window .. was not made aware of this on check in and I was put in a room that was right next to where they were working. Men were outside my window drilling and hammering into the walls all day. I couldn't even hear myself think or hear the tv it was so loud! From 9am on... told the receptionist but nothing was done about it.. disappointing for an expensive stay I expected more. ",2,2017,04,23
228,No air conditioning ,"We are having a mini road trip this weekend and have travelled in to Dublin tonight for two nights. We had a choice of many hotels and chose the Hilton because it is a great brand even though it was at a higher rate of other similar hotels... 
Although a very pleasant hotel, very professional and friendly staff I am very disappointed that the hotel looks like a building site from the outside and absolutely no air conditioning in the rooms. The rooms are very stuffy and we are not able to open the window as it is so noisy outside due to the main road.  
Not getting a great night sleep and not what we need to be refreshed for a day of exploring tomorrow. 
Very disappointed.... 

",3,2017,04,22
228,American style hotel in Dublin,"Even under construction, it was a great hotel.  Going back again in a week.  It will be like going home, knowing that we will have a comfortable room in a great location.  Would recommend the Hilton Garden to anyone traveling to Dublin",5,2017,04,22
228,"No complaints, a pleasant one night stay","I picked this hotel for it’s location as I travelled to Dublin by bus to attend a show in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. It took me less than 5 minutes to walk from Busaras to the hotel. First impressions were good with a modern & spacious foyer area. Check in was quick, friendly & informative & in no time, I was in the lift up to my non smoking room facing the river. A good sized, spotlessly clean & comfortable room with carpet floor & all the things required for a pleasant one night stay. Very comfortable double bed, work desk & chair, tv, armchair, safe, tea/coffee, iron & ironing board, full length mirror, fridge, smoke alarm. Temperature in the room at night was on the warm side but I wouldn’t go as far as to call it being like a sauna. Plenty of natural light & very good black out curtains, no noise issues whatsoever & so, sleep quality was excellent. The free wifi was very good, fast & consistent. 
My bathroom was ok, size wise.  Fully tiled with bath, fixed head shower with plenty of hot water but not the greatest pressure, hairdryer, shaving socket, good quality toiletries & plenty of towels.	
I didn’t eat in the hotel in the evening but did have breakfast there. I went down at 08.00 & it was busy but I did manage to get a table almost instantly. Buffet style with a very good selection including full fry, cereals,  toast, waffles, croissants, pastries, yoghurts, ham slices, cheese, omelettes, boiled eggs, fruit, fruit juices, tea & coffee. Complimentary national daily newspapers were available.
There were vending machines with snacks & drinks. I cannot comment on the gym/fitness room as I did not use it.
All staff that I encountered were friendly, helpful & attentive.
Location wise, the hotel was excellent. As already mentioned, just a few minutes walk from Busaras, 10 to 15 minutes walk to both Bord Gais Energy Theatre & 3Arena, Convention Centre is nearby & O Connell Street is an easy straight stroll following the river. The Jeanie Johnston famine ship museum is moored right outside of the hotel & there is a Luas light rail/tram stop at the back of the hotel.",5,2017,04,21
228,Great service throughout,"I stayed here for 4 nights on business in March and had a very good stay. All of the staff that I dealt with throughout my stay were polite, professional and friendly which really makes all the difference when you are away on your own I find.

The room was clean, everything worked and I got a good nights sleep every night. When I stayed the hotel was clad in scaffolding and there was major works on-going as the hotel installs air conditioning and additional rooms. FINE! Now hats off to Hilton for making that very clear on their web site. They said that there might be noise during work hours and I was in the office for 8-30am and not back home until 6pm or 7pm this was fine and I never heard a peep. But I really do appreciate them making you aware of it. I stayed twice at Le Meridien Monte Carlo and there's nothing quite like arriving with your wife and kids for a winter break (having chosen a hotel with an indoor pool) only to be told that the swimming pool is shut and major works are ongoing throughout. 

This was how things like that should be communicated - nice and transparent! :-)

Just to point at that when I stayed there was no air con. They have fitted the control units but it's not obviously plumbed in yet. They have however kindly put a fan in the wardrobe which was very helpful indeed and kept me cool enough in the room to sleep well each night.

So staff very good, room very good.....lets move on to the facilities. Well with only 4 days in Dublin I have to say I was lazy and did not seek out any gym facilities. Instead I got my exercise by strolling down to the bar each evening and exercising the right arm with some pints. I am delighted to say that this is an incredibly well stocked bar for anyone who likes beer, cider, stouts, ales, etc. I cannot under estimate what a great range of drinks were on offer.

Bar prices in the hotel for a frequenter of London and Kent pubs was a bit steep at approx. €6-50 / £6 a pint but having gone to a local pub to catch up with a friend I was surprised that the pub was dearer than the hotel! So I guess not so bad after all.

Onto the food! The first night I had a burger and fries room service with beer. After a late evening flight into Dublin I really appreciated the receptionist contacting the kitchen to ask them to stick around so I could get some room service. That was a nice touch. The fact that they did room service beer by the pint instead of a tiny little bottle was even better as I was spitting feathers by the time I got off of the plane!

Most evenings I had a two course deal and whilst my firm were footing the bill I need to be mindful of costs and I felt that the food was tasty, nicely presented and good value. There was some handy TV's playing Moto GP bike racing which was perfect for me to gawp at whilst I was having dinner and messaging the family back home.

Each day my room was cleaned to clinical perfection.

Check out was silky smooth.

I would recommend this hotel and will probably be staying there again in Q4.

Thanks for reading my review, I hope you have found it helpful.

Thanks Hilton Garden Inn staff :-)",4,2017,04,19
228,"Good, modern hotel, under construction","Overall, the hotel was clean, updated, and in a decent location in the city.  The flaws are that it was under construction so noises started before 8AM, the parking lot was hard to access during the construction, the drop-off area was cluttered with taxis so guests can't actually drop-off and the bathroom cleaning during the stay seemed like a rush job.  I wouldn't mind staying again but for the price I may look for other options before I do.",4,2017,04,19
228,Great Location To See Dublin,"Right on the river, short walk to Trinity, Dublin Castle, etc.  LUAS right behind the hotel to easy exploring further out.  Clean rooms, helpful staff.   There is construction currently going on, but they kept it to mid-day hours so our sleep was never disturbed.   And we could still enjoy the view of the river from our room.",4,2017,04,18
228,"Clean, with friendly staff and a great location","This Hilton Garden puts you in a great location to see Dublin.  Situated on the north side of the River Liffey with quick access to a footbridge and the south side of the river.  Most major sites are walking distance from the hotel and the Hop on/Hop off buses stop directly in front of the hotel.  As for the hotel, it is a Hilton Garden - clean and reliable accommodations as you would expect anywhere.",4,2017,04,16
228,Lovely building site. ,"We arrived at the hotel, and the front is covered with scaffolding. It's ugly, and we weren't warned about it. 

Once inside, it's a very nice hotel, the staff were helpful and polite, the facilities were good and the food delicious (and reasonably priced). 

Our view was awful, I know some rooms overlook the river so was hopeful to have one of those, very disappointed. There were posters in the lift apologising for a building work, but for the price paid for the room, I expect a bit more. Once the building work is over, I'm sure it'll be splendid. ",3,2017,04,15
228,Lovely ,Stayed here to go to a concert at the 3arena. Gorgeous hotel very quiet at night excellent staff. My only small complaint was the noise from builders. We had a long journey and wanted a nap when we arrived that was out of the question with the noise right outside the window. Patience here is the key the hotel is under a lot of construction at the minute so it's a little inconvenient although the hotel are doing everything they can to keep disruption to a minimum ,4,2017,04,14
228,Stay for the customer service alone,"The biggest highlight at the hotel was the customer service. All of the staff at the front desk and the restaurant were fantastic, but I have to give particular praise to Vlasta (tall, light brown hair, glasses, beautiful, I'm guessing Slavic(?) from her accent). Our flight arrived in the morning and we knew we might not be able to check-in to the hotel early, but figured we'd drop our luggage off at the least and hope for the best. Vlasta could obviously see the desperation in our eyes for a shower and quick nap after traveling for ~17 hours and no sleep, so she saw to it that our room was ready within 30 minutes. We could not be more grateful! She was incredibly kind and friendly--we really felt taken care of. Later, she helped us with directions around the city and finding our way to the train. The restaurant team was also great. We stopped in there for a snack while we were waiting, and although it was in-between service times (between breakfast and lunch), they let us know they'd make us sandwiches or something--they'd talk to the chef to make sure we could get something to eat. Everyone was just very friendly and helpful.

We stayed for one night in a king room (no river view). The room and bathroom were small, but not tiny--didn't feel cramped, but not a ton of extra space for going through/reorganizing luggage on the floor. The room was exceptionally clean, very comfortable, and nicely decorated. The bed was also very comfortable and we slept well.

The location is excellent--10-15 minute walk to Trinity College/Temple Bar and the main ""highlights"" of Dublin. The light rail is on the block behind the hotel if you're headed to further off places and the public parking garage is right behind the hotel. 

The breakfast offerings were great--typical continental breakfast items, plus full Irish breakfast items, a made-to-order omelet bar, and self-made waffles. Yum!

In some reviews people are complaining about the construction. The hotel makes it very clear on their website that there is construction happening and what times it will occur. It was not a nuisance as we were fully informed and expecting it (and most of the time it was happening we were not in the hotel anyway). The only minor inconvenience is that the back access from the parking garage to the hotel is closed, so you have to walk around on the sidewalk--not a problem, but there were still signs up making it appear like it was an option.

If I find myself needing to stay in a hotel in the heart of Dublin again, I will most definitely stay here, and hope that Vlasta is still there to make the stay exceptional! But with a river view next time!",4,2017,04,13
228,Concert Visit,"I brought my two teenage sons to this hotel in order to accommodate an overnight for a concert we were going to at the 3 Arena. I must say they've done it up beautifully. All the Hilton perks are evident and more importantly, it made concert attendance a cinch because we were able to walk to the arena and back without a bother. It is a straight shot down the quay at about a 10 minute walk. Lovely hotel, clean rooms, good food, and all the usual Hilton amenities.",5,2017,04,12
228,Great if you want to stay at a building site,"Dublin' s first Bob the Builder themed hotel. 

Given a room on the first floor, no need to set an alarm, as soon as 10am comes the drill in the room next door crank up. 

There is a nice note saying the building works will improve the hotel and add bedrooms. 

Check if building works are continuing before booking. if they are avoid.",1,2017,04,12
228,Family holiday off to a great start,"Our family of 4 (2 x adults & 2 x children) stayed in Sept 2016 only for two nights as Dublin was the starting place for our Europe holiday. We stayed in a two queen bed family room which was very spacious with plenty of room for everyone. Location was great, especially with the hop-on/off bus stop located right outside (great for us tourists who had never been to Dublin before). Right on the river, we were able to walk to restaurants etc. There is a communal laundry (which I believe has had more machines added to it since we left) and small shop on the ground floor. Overall the service and comfort was great and we would stay again.",4,2017,04,11
228,Great Dublin Hotel,"The Hilton Garden Inn in Dublin was fantastic.  Great location, easy to get to everything by foot.  It is family friendly, wonderful breakfast and bar area.  So cool to be on the River Liffey.  We recommend it!",5,2017,04,10
228,Decent stay,"I was generally happy with my stay but could not give 5 stars.  The room was comfortable and clean and the front desk staff were great with local recommendations for a bite to eat or a pint.  The breakfast was very good and enjoyable.  The thing that was troublesome was the shower.  The water pressure was so bad I could barely rinse off.  I hate that feeling.  The two most important things to me in a hotel room are the comfort of the bed and the ability to take a nice hot shower.  I had to take off a star for that, but everything else was pretty good, despite the fact that renovations were ongoing.  In addition, to adding rooms, I believe they are installing air conditioning, which will be a big improvement.",4,2017,04,10
228,Good experience ,From the check in mary Marty  even with renovations going on Hilton garden custom house gives  an excellent service from the clean bright great view from our room  comfy bed fab pillows to Ritchie that serviced  us a great meal  good choice to the breakfast team hot food topped up regularly presentation of all breakfast  top class  and very friendly helpful staff and we're busy but still very professional would highly recommend Hilton garden custom house  hope to be back soon Alice declan,5,2017,04,09
228,Way overpriced,"€201 for a double room in a hotel that was under construction. We were not informed of this when booking was made.
This had us awake from 06:30 in the morning with the drilling and banging. Cleaners were also hoovering from 08:00. There is much better value to be had.
",2,2017,04,09
228,Very disappointed,"My sisters and I had booked into this hotel with Booking.com on 2/3 March 2017  - we were going to Carmen and it was near by.  Unfortunately, we had a family crisis and had to cancel...which I did on Tuesday 21st February by telephoning the hotel receptionist. I also emailed Booking.com to this effect.
The full amount was taken from my account by the hotel and Booking.com say my email was'nt ""picked up"" !!
These are the facts ... customer care ??

228,An IDEAL Location to Stay in Dublin!!!,"We stayed here five nights over St. Patrick's Day and do not have one complaint!  

Rooms were very clean and modern.  Location was perfect and right near the convention center if that is your destination.

Sightseeing buses, city buses, as well as the bus to the airport are right outside the hotel.  The Liffey River cruise boat is right down the street. The hotel's location enabled us to walk to the Must Sees of Dublin.  The price tends to be much lower than other Hilton brand hotels, which is something I can't explain but won't complain.  They are adding two floors/more rooms so obviously I'm not the only tourist who sees the multiple values in staying at this hotel.

The front desk staff including Patricia, and Mary, the acting manager, were hands on and determined to make guest stays run smoothly.   I will NEVER forget Sharon Conroy who holds many roles at that hotel including being a Front Desk agent.  I was in contact with her a few times over the months prior to our arrival.  Her kindness, dedication and level of professionalism are unlike any other I have encountered during my various stays at Hilton hotels.  Sharon, just like the hotel, is a real gem!",5,2017,04,06
228,Good,Very happy. Would stay again. Love to stay in july but date it is full up. As was so happy with stay. Am a single parent with 2 special needs children and wad very happy with stay as well. The noise was work being down was the only thing thar upset children. ,5,2017,04,05
228,Dublin stay,"Had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Dublin,staff was knowledgable and friendly.rooms were very nice and modern, clean and everything we needed was available.breakfast and dinner were very good also and I would recommend the resturant . There was a good prices special available and the quality of food was excellent. Location is great and bus to and from airport is available right outside the door,easy access to all,and I will certainly return
",5,2017,04,04
228,Good hotel,Nice place. The hotel was under construction but never effected us. It was a mile walk of temple bar. And a half mile from Trinity Collage. Rooms were great a little larger for Europe. Good food in hotel restaurant. Nice staff.,5,2017,04,04
228,Great stay - shame about your rude check in staff!,"I would have given this hotel 4 out of 5 because the rooms are decorated and furbished to a high standard as are all the public areas and the hotel is in a great location. 
However the check-in staff really let down this hotel and gave us a very negative experience on arrival. We had booked 2 rooms through booking.com, the receptionist could only find 1 room on their system, even after showing the print out confirmation from booking.com she was adamant I had only booked 1 room and told me it was my fault. I told her that this was not my fault and the error had occured between booking.com and themselves. She was very rude and very unhelpful. After a while a different receptionist advised me that the 2nd room was booked it was just booked with the wrong spelling - apparently again this was my fault even though all details were correct on my booking.com confirmation! 
At long last we were able to check in - to my dismay as I get out the shower a woman just walks into my room - apparently she had been given the same room as me and her key card worked on my door - this is very bad customer service, i would have hated to be a lone female in my room and a man just walks in after I come out the shower!! Overall the check in staff need to trained to provide better customer service. 
All that aside the hotel itself is great and worth a stay.",3,2017,04,04
228,Refurb,"Ok hotel near city but still close to ferry terminal. Hotel is currently being rebranded, refurbished and extended.. This gives some minor disruptions but on the whole ok.  Food is not 4* in my opinion.. little bit ""Pub Grub"" fair..  Wine list is not very extensive. A couple standing at Bar the chap was swearing quite frequently .. He was not challenged by bar staff.",3,2017,04,03
228,Check out others,"This is an ok hotel, location is in business district so most things are quite a far walk - bus in front creates noise, under construction, no AC.  The biggest issue was the general lack of hospitality in this hotel.",3,2017,04,03
228,"Not bad, Not great-could be better.","I booked using Citi ThankYou points and although I'm a Honors Diamond member, I knew chances of getting a room upgrade is slim. Sure enough I arrived and got a standard room which had ""accessibility"" features (all my body parts are in working order). I'm not sure if all rooms have this feature but given I'm a minority (Asian), I wasn't sure if this was an insult or they clearly didn't have a better room in the middle of a not so busy week (needless to say, I'm sure management will reply here to assure the latter). And if indeed this is their standard room, it is smaller than other Garden Inn properties I've stayed around the world. Despite the size, it was clean and functional with no frills views. Only complaint is that the shower head pressure was very low and yes, I've checked the settings. The bathtub was clearly designed for disabled persons.   The lobby is a good size, service reps were friendly and efficient, and breakfast was not bad but the coffee needs improvement. I use hotel fitness centers often and this one is ok yet a bit small-access is not ideal since you would need to walk past the lobby from room elevators so coming back sweaty can be embarrassing when the lobby is crowded with people. At time of this review, be aware of the noisy renovation work going on during business hours. Overall, this was an okay stay-not bad, almost as good, not great. 3.5/5 stars. A suggestion would be a free shuttle service to the Temple bar area or such.",3,2017,04,01
228,A Hilton by any other name,"Hilton hotels didn't get where they are by being quirky or innovative. Another Hilton, another town, and perhaps there doesn't seem much to say, but this one benefits from its helpful, cheerful staff, a good location and an ongoing uplift by adding extra rooms and refreshing the decor. Much needed is the air-con: Tantalisingly, the controls were there, but the system has not yet been commissioned so our corner room on the first floor was oppressively hot and we could not open the window because the handle had been deactivated (besides which, it would have been very noisy). The other oddity was the wifi, although we could connect on two devices, internet availability was totally unpredictable and intermittent. Reception offered us the option of talking to a telephone helpdesk but said they had not had any other complaints, which is odd as our iPhones worked perfectly well everywhere else. Otherwise, the hotel facilities were excellent, breakfast was everything you could want and we always felt we were in good hands.",3,2017,04,01
228,Excellent,"Excellent location, very friendly and helpful staff, definitely stay at this hotel again when I visit Dublin in the near future.
Restaurant and bar area very nice, plenty of seating areas and reasonably priced.",5,2017,04,01
228,Great staff and Location,"Construction was almost complete on the hotel but there was some noise during the business day and covered in scaffold. The rooms are well equipped and quite spacious. The location was great for all means of transportation and the on-off tour bus stops right outside the hotel. Even though on the main road, traffic noise wasn't a problem. Hotel security is good. We added breakfast to our room cost and it was well worth it for our daily start.  The entire staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and one staff member even brought chocolate to my daughter.",5,2017,03,31
228,"Great Stay, Location and Staff","Hotel is currently under construction. Adding another floor I think so it's noisy at times and covered in scaffold. The rooms are well equipped and quite spacious. Didn't eat in the hotel as Dublin has some amazing places, for any meal during anytime of day. Location is great, near the train and bus station, also the airport bus stops right outside as do the sight seeing tour buses. Even though on the main road, traffic noise wasn't a problem. Hotel security is good. Room service was very good. Rooms were rather warm during the night and no visible AC unit to be found to adjust. Definitely worth a stay if heading to Dublin.",4,2017,03,29
228,Good value and nice location,"Excellent breakfast spread, good lunch time menu (10 options, 10 minutes and 10 Euros) although this is not available at weekends - the menu is limited then.  Room clean and whilst the Hotel was full didn't hear any guest 'travel' in corridors/doors.  Currently there is refurbishment going on so only weekends without external work noise - don't be put off, refresh has to happen!  Gym (i didn't use), downstairs pantry to fill up your room fridge, good bar and costa coffee bar - well used by the city workers.",4,2017,03,29
228,Good Location,"We booked this hotel from the 16th to the 19th March on behalf of ourselves, our son and his partner and our other son so that we could all celebrate our eldest son's 30th birthday and St. Patrick's Day in Dublin. We were a bit dismayed as it got closer to our stay to learn that there was work going on at the hotel but we were reassured by hotel management that work would not disturb our stay, and that turned out to be the case. The hotel is well located, a short walk from O'Connell Street and the Temple Bar Quarter. If you cross the Liffey using the nearest foot bridge the road on the other side leads directly up to Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green (about 20 minutes walk) All the rooms we booked were comfortable and although at the front of the hotel we weren't disturbed by road noise, or noise of any kind. The staff were at all times friendly and helpful and even put a box of chocolates and a birthday card in our son's room on the 17th, which I thought was a nice touch. We opted for inclusive breakfast with our rooms and I have to say it was one of my better decisions! The breakfasts were all you could possibly want from continental to full-Irish and became a highlight of our three-day stay. Other than the breakfasts we didn't eat in the hotel but plenty of others were, especially on Saturday the 18th. Instead, we went out to dinner and on two occasions ate at McGettigans Cook House and Bar at the North Star Hotel in Amiens Road at the back of the hotel. Getting to the hotel from the Airport couldn't have been easier as the 747 airport bus stops by the hotel, both coming and going. On the 19th we went out to the airport to collect our rental car for the next leg of the journey and drove back to the hotel to collect our bags. I'm aware that some people have said how warm the rooms could be and my wife and I found this to be the case but the hotel have reassured me that as part of the refurbishment, air conditioning would be installed in guest rooms and in fairness it was March when trying to balance heating with the vagaries of the weather must be a nightmare. So, the bottom line, would I stay here again if going to Dublin? Definitely! Would I recommend the hotel to friends and family? Again, definitely!",5,2017,03,27
228,Short stay in Dublin,We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. It was convenient for the main tourist areas of Dublin. Receptionists were really helpful and efficient and the room was lovely. Only downside was the building works and scaffolding around  the outside of the hotel. As we were out all day any noise made by the builders did not bother us.,5,2017,03,26
228,Great spot,"Great spot for exploring the city
Especially if you watching footy or rugby at the local stadiums 
20 min taxi €25 from airport
20 min walk to stadiums
15 min walk to temple bar and 1 hour stagger back 
Hotel great 
Bar opens very very late ",4,2017,03,25
228,Nice,"Located in finance area but just convenient enough for main sights, hop on hop off buses outside, restaurants nearby, walking distance from temple bar approx 20 minutes. Weekend lunch menu restrictive but weekdays good value. Hotel currently been regduvenated but doesn't affect guests",4,2017,03,25
228,Could not fault.,"Bit late to the party but I stayed here in January for 1 night with my friend for a girls night. 

I had never been to Dublin before and arrived at the airport around 9.30am. I called the hotel explaining of our early arrival and asked if we could check in early or drop our bags in.

When we arrived at 10.30am we were greeted by a lovely lady who explained the other receptionist had already checked us in and provided us with or room key. 

a beautiful room with a river view, this just goes to show how much they go above and beyond I am fully aware they did not have to do that.

My stay was delightful, the interior was gorgeous.

Would reccomend highly.",5,2017,03,24
228,Really nice hotel,"Very happy with my stay at Hilton Garden Inn, lovely comfortable room with very comfy bed. The bathroom is modern and has shower and bath option which I really like. All staff from reception to restaurant helpful and friendly. Perfect for business or holiday in Dublin, Luas stop very convenient. Will stay here again 😊",5,2017,03,23
228,Expensive but good,A high class hotel that delivers on service and facilities. The drinks are quite expensive but the hotel is well placed and the service is good. I would use this hotel again if the price is right. Overall a good visit,4,2017,03,22
228,Great Location and Value,The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of the Temple Bar area. Just far enough away to not have all the noise. Great views from the walking bridges at Custom Quay and we were easily able to walk to Trinity College. Guiness and St. Patrick's Cathedral are a little too far in the cooler weather but overall enjoyed the hotel's cleanliness and location. The staff were personable and the family room suited the needs of our visit. I would certainly stay here on future visits.,4,2017,03,22
228,St Patrick's weekend,Fantastic hotel with extremely friendly and attentive staff. Very comfy beds & excellent choice of food at breakfast buffet. Central location and a nice 10 minute walk to centre of Dublin. Only negative was bedroom quite warm but I understand air con is being fitted to all rooms. ,5,2017,03,21
228,Excellent stay and value for money,"Stayed here on 12th March and was very impressed.. great location, lovely clean rooms and excellent breakfast.. definitely would recommend this hotel to friends and family.. stayed here before when it was a jury's inn... a much superior hotel now..",5,2017,03,20
228,Clean and Tidy Hotel,"I stayed here whilst on a business trip and enjoyed my stay. The hotel itself is currently being refurbished but I did not come into contact with any of the construction work whilst there. The hotel is clean and tidy, the staff are friendly and accommodating.",5,2017,03,20
228,A Standard Hilton Garden Inn,"Well located along the new docks, in the refurbished part of the city of Dublin, but still very close to the center.
No trouble with this hotel which is well maintained and clean.
Very positive point, the rooms on the street despite traffic have perfect sound proofing!
Good breakfast at a reasonable price.
Only negative point: the decoration is really out dated ",4,2017,03,18
228,Clean Spacious Rooms and great location,"The hotel is clean and the rooms are average for this type of hotel but they are all very clean. The walls are quite thin between the rooms. You can hear a lot!

We stayed here for one night as we were going to a gig in the Three Area. It is a great location just off the centre of the city and walking distance to the arena. 

The breakfast was a plus and I would recommend it. Good choice of hot and cold buffet breakfast. The only negative is the price of the drinks at the bar. Very expensive considering you can walk 5 minutes and have 20 cheaper options. The car park next door is handy too",4,2017,03,16
228,No air conditioning in rooms,"I'm writing this review from my room in the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House, and it pains me to do this, but I have to give this hotel a poor rating based solely on the lack of air conditioning in the rooms. Even with temperatures outside at 51 F, our room is uncomfortably warm, and we have to keep our window open with a fan on, even during the night. This would not be so bad, except that the hotel is situated on a very busy street, with lots of construction happening all around, which means that by 6am, our room is flooded with light and filled with the roar of traffic and hammering.

I expect better from the Hilton brand. It's not acceptable for a hotel chain of this stature to open a property without adequate in-room climate control. A hotel room should be a comfortable refuge, not a place one can't wait to leave. It's a shame, because the rest of the hotel is very nice, and the staff is warm and friendly.",2,2017,03,16
228,good,"The hotel and rooms has a cosy - moden feel. Location perfect. It ś pitty the reconstruction plastering just now...   The price wasn´t adapted...   Personal - receptionists and the cooks were professional, heartly.",3,2017,03,16
228,Business trips,"I stay here quite a lot on business. 

The rooms are spotless and the reception staff are approachable and friendly. 

Location is excellent, close to CHQ and the Convention Centre. Luas is about a 3 minute walk away and there is a bus stop right out front for going to the airport. 

Gym is 24hr and there is a business centre that offers free printing. 

Morning breakfast is plentiful and fresh.",5,2017,03,15
228,Not bad but there are better hotels for the price,"As some of my colleagues were staying in this hotel as well, I decided to give it a try. Not long ago this was the Jury's Inn and I suppose that place wasn't in the same league as most Hilton hotels and I'm afraid not much has changed. It started with the reception, usually one of the better aspects of any Hilton, giving me the feeling of being in a Holiday Inn. The rooms are smallish but sufficient, it's the absence of an airco that was a real surprise. It was cold at night! The breakfast is again more Holiday Inn style with little choice and toasters that don't work properly. Most hotels in Dublin will serve a cup of tea or coffee but not here. What's good? The location, the wifi and the beds, and the latter is certainly important. However, at this price you're way better off at The Morrison, a Hilton sister hotel that's stylish and where the service is superb or even The Davenport if you prefer more a classic style. That's where I'll stay next time!",3,2017,03,15
228,Perfect location,"We came here in February as a family of 6, 4 of us had been to Dublin before but 2 were completely new. The location of the hotel was perfect a short walk and you were at temple bar but you were far enough away to have a great night sleep with no back ground noise. Unfortunately for us they were having building work done which was very noisy in the mornings but nothing we couldn't get over. The hotel was very clean and tidy, spacious rooms and a lovely lobby. Highly recommend.",4,2017,03,14
228,C2C Weekend,"Fantastic hotel. Check-in is 3pm, having an early flight, we planned to drop our luggage with hotel to return later, however to our great & much appreciated surprise our room was available. We checked in & were told we were more than welcome to enjoy breakfast & add to our bill, which we did & this too was fantastic, we ate breakfast & lunch Sunday & Monday of our stay in the hotel & we were not disappointed, food was delicious, hot, great choice & tasty. Rooms are light, bright & well equipped. Great location. Don't hesitate to book. *****",5,2017,03,13
228,Dreadfully cold and poorly cooked breakfasts,"The first attempt to get a cooked breakfast involed selecting items from the hot plates. So far so good. Most things looked OK. I placed my delection on a warm plate. At the table.....the musrooms were simply cold, not tepid just cold. The hash brown was tepid and greasy. The black and white pudding pieces were most but quite cold. The eggs were 'old' hard and ... guess what .....tepid.
I asked for a manager and explained what was on my plate and asked her for a hot breakfast. Almost 15 minutes later she returned with what she described as a very hot plate. I thanked her, looked a the eggs which were significanly uncooked with the whites being raw/transparent. So the second effort to get a hot breakfast had also failed.
She took that plate away and returned to the kitchen. About 10 minutes later she came back with an even hotter plate from being under a lamp, or similar. The eggs were just seriously overcooked. It felt like a message from the kitchen!
I tried each of the items. The bacon was heading for dry and overheated card board, the puddings similarly dried out, the sausages hot, the mushrooms had vanished, a tomato had appeared. By which stage both my tea and toast had grown cold.
I picked at the pieces. The supervisor came back and I advised her that no temperature checks had been carried out on the food in the hot plates in the 3/4 hour I had been sitting in front of it.
""We do checks of a mininum of one every hour"" .... minimum indeed. So both tepid and unsavoury as well as unhealthy.
Three efforts to get a reasonable and hot breakfast here failed.
I write this today because this also happened 2 weeks ago. I thought them they were just having a bad day. Now I'm pretty sure they have bad kitchen practices.
I won't be trying breakfast here a third time.",2,2017,03,13
228,Birthday Celebrations,"We originally booked the Riverhouse Hotel in Temple Bar and I am so relieved we changed last minute to the Hilton (our friends remained in the Riverhouse and it sounded shocking).  The Hilton was clean, modern and had extremely friendly staff.  The only draw back was the scaffolding outside our room, we could hear the workmen around 8am every morning even on Saturday, but we understand that renovations have to be carried out.  They workmen were quiet it was only the clanking of the work boots on the scaffold we could hear.  I would choose to stay again but would request a room in the middle of the hotel, we were in a corner room at the edge of the hotel, whilst renovations are undertaken.  Room was immaculate and plenty of shower gels, shampoo etc provided daily along with coffee, tea etc.  A hairdryer is supplied in the room so great for light travellers.  Not to far a walk to the centre, bus stop right outside the hotel for those who aren't keen on walking and always plenty of taxi's outside.  Loved our stay here.",4,2017,03,13
228,Super stay,"Wonderful hotel, very helpful staff, room clean and very spacious. We arrived early but our room wasn't quite ready so our cases were kept safe while we explored Dublin. When we did get our room there was a lovely card and box of chocolates as it was our wedding anniversary which i thought was a lovely touch. Amazing breakfast with everyone catered for, full Irish, cereals, waffle station, egg station, cold meats, cheeses, fruit. Would recommend to anyone and will certainly be returning whenever i go back to Dublin.",5,2017,03,12
228,FANTASTIC HOTEL! EVERYTHING YOU NEED!,"We stayed here in march 2017 for my boyfriends birthday. we have previously stayed in a Hilton in England around a year ago. The Hilton in Dublin is way above the standard we received in England. I can not recommend this hotel enough! The staff were amazing and helped us with everything! they help us plan our visit to different tourist attractions around the city, bus routes, places eat, nightlife etc.
The hotel is beautifully presented to the highest standards. Our room was on the second floor away from the building work going on at the front of the hotel so didn't effort our stay at all. we never once heard any of the building work. The room was a perfect size for the 2 of us, spotlessness cleaned. i work as quality control in a hotel in England so finding it so perfectly cleaned and maintenance to such a high standard was GREAT!

THIS HOTEL IS THE BEST IVE STAYED IN BY FAR!
if your looking for a lovely city break and a hotel that close to the town center and all the bars and restaurants this is PERFECT for you!

I would like to say a massive thank you too all the staff as they made us feel at home and very welcome in the city of dublin.",5,2017,03,11
228,Great Stay in a Beautiful City,"We stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn over the Summer in 2016 and it was absolutely amazing.  The Hotel is situated in the heart of Dublin right next to the River Liffey.  The views were amazing and the fact that the River Liffey swim happened while we were there was incredible.  Also with in view of the hotel is the Famine memorial.  
The hotel is within walking distance to everything.  We walked to the convention center which was having a Comic-con while we were there.  We walked to Trinity College which was incredible. We walked to all the pubs and eateries you could ever want or need.  We walked to movies and entertainment.  Everything was close.  Probably the best thing though was the fact that the tour bus stopped right outside our down.
As for the hotel, we couldn't have been happier with it.  The rooms were spacious and well cared for.  Everything outside the rooms was spotless and well maintained. The hotel has all the amenities that you could ask for.  Weight room/exercise room, business center and laundry.  The only thing missing was a pool but I am not sure how necessary that is in Dublin.  One big drawback was the lack of Air Conditioning in the rooms which you may not think was necessary in Ireland but there were nights that the rooms were hot.  The hotel did provide fans but Air Conditioning would be much better.  The hotel Manager said they had plans to add that in the upcoming year so it should be air conditioned by the summer of 2017. Speaking of management, they were fantastic.  I had email conversations with the hotel leading up to my stay to verify that our rooms were connected and that we had transportation to the hotel and Patrick, the manager, was so great and accommodating.  He responded promptly to every email.  Made sure all our needs were met and then even greeted us when we arrived.  He was really spectacular!  Thank you Patrick!  His staff were great too.  Everyone was so nice and professional.  The Hotel is top notch and the breakfast was amazing.  All the food tasted great and the staff was jovial and kept things beautiful and moving fast.  We couldn't have been happier with our stay and will probably never stay anywhere else in Dublin.
Thank you Patrick & Mary and the rest of the Staff at the Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House!",5,2017,03,10
228,Amazing! ,"I cannot fault this hotel. From the moment we walked through the door until the moment we left it was simply perfect. Although the hotel is undergoing renovations and construction, that didn't alter our view and experience here. The breakfast was well stocked with everything you could want! (Don't be put off by the look of the scrambled eggs, they taste lovely). The rooms were spotlessly clean, spacious and very welcoming. We stayed for 3 nights and found that we had plenty of room for that time. 
Hotel has a small gym, laundry service, business center and room service. Restaurant food really good but not a great deal of choice!
Everyone around the hotel were fantastic, particularly the bar staff who were lovely and chatty! 
The hotel is set on the river side and takes about a 15-20 minute walk to the Temple Bar area, but there is the Blue service 'citysightseening' bus stop just down the riverside. As you walk out of the hotel, take a left. The area is pretty safe with plenty of people always walking around. If you can walk or take a bus, do it. Taxis are pretty expensive! 
All round a perfect trip, thank you. I wish there were more Hilton Garden Inns in the UK. It has been a very perfect stay! ",5,2017,03,09
228,Great Hotel,"Great service, modern rooms (hotel recently refurbished), great location, Really clean and food is great for breakfast. I always stay here when I'm in Dublin. Car parking is just around the corner and costs around €15 for 24 hours, this is cheap for Dublin. ",5,2017,03,08
228,Friendly Hilton on the water front,"The Hilton Garden Inn is well placed with easy walking access to the restaurants and bars and in the other direction to the conference centre. The bar is welcoming snd there is a small restaurant at the rear. The food is reasonably priced and of good standard, with enough variety on the menu.
The rooms are recently refurbished and reception and staff are friendly and helpful too. I will definitely use this hotel again on my next trips to Dublin.",4,2017,03,08
228,Great stay,"Visited here 4th march for 2 nights.The staff could not have been more helpful from arriving till our departure.The room was more than adequate comfy bed,fridge and safe and spotlessly clean.The breakfast was superb with everything excellently cooked and plentiful.  only 10 mins walk to temple bar area.Also we had box of chocolates and an anniversary card waiting in our room which was a lovely touch. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying again on our next visit to Dublin ",5,2017,03,08
228,"Helpful staff, good location","The current renovations were not intrusive so had negligible impact. I had a great view over the Liffey and the short (10-12 min) walk to the north side of the city helped work off some of the excellent breakfast!  There is much to see and do on the south side so would highly recommend the HGI for price, quality and location.",5,2017,03,06
228,Great Stay... Very Comfortable...,This would initially put you off nowadays due to the ongoing renovations. But it is like new inside. My wife and I enjoyed the comfort of the bed and pillows and cleanliness of the room. We stayed at the 4th floor so we don't have an issue on noise. This was a perfect hotel to stay for us since we were there to watch Carmen Opera at the Bord Gais Theatre. I would say that it is a great experience and we would come back here again. Luas station is also close at its back and the view of the river is great from our room.,4,2017,03,06
228,Lovely Hotel overlooking the river,"I stayed here for 2 nights for my nieces hen party.  I shared with 2 other girls.  The rooms had been sold for 3 people, but there were 2 double beds hence, 2 ladies had to share!  it wasn't ideal but it was manageable.  We stayed here on a room only basis, so I can't comment on the food in the hotel.  The room was very clean & comfortable & we overlooked the river.  It was very modernly furnished with 2 double beds, TV, hairdryer & tea & coffee making facilities.  My only comment was that there wasn't enough 2 bags for 3 ladies!  The shower was very nice too and offered complimentary toiletries.  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful & gave us advise on how to get to places.  The hotel is within walking distance of the city centre.  If I went to Dublin again I would definatley stay here again.",4,2017,03,06
228,Hilton,Hotel was great except terrible noise from builders starting work at 7am (Sunday) having broken their contract conditions so not totally the hotels fault. Matter resolved satisfactorily however. All staff lovely! ,4,2017,03,06
228,Best in the area,"From Dublin Airport we have arrived with Airlink Express Bus no 747 to Dublin Convention Center stop and from there a very short walk to hotel.On our way back to airport this bus stops just in front of the hotel door . Nice reception and very helpful staff , since the check in time was 3 pm. they have located our luggages to locker room . They are gave us details and city map . Our room was overlooked the river Liffey , very good view. Hotel is centrally located , however there were not much restaurants around it , you need to walk towards O’Connell street where there are nice bar for drink and meal.On the opposite side there is only on eItalian Restaurant , but expensive and serves only one type beer.The breakfast was in the room rate , it was perfect on many different choises. Gym is nice too.",5,2017,03,05
228,Great Hotel,Great hotel across from the river. Centrally located. The bus stop is right outside the door. The front desk staff was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to tours and things to do in Dublin and the surrounding areas. I would most definitely stay here again.,5,2017,03,04
228,Nice hotel good location ,"Stayed for 3 nights whilst visiting to see Russell Howard at vicar street. It is located in the financial district so is a little way away from the main pub/shopping area but easily walkable. The area near the hotel has a reasonable amount of food places but you will want to head into town for waterholes.
The hotel itself is very smart and clean with helpful staff. Every evening there were complimentary little cakes offered at reception which was a nice touch. We had a queen room which was spacious and comfortable. Even though our room faced the river and was on a busy main road the glazing blocked out most of the sound. The curtains did a good job of excluding most of the sunlight.
The 747 Dublin bus stops outside the hotel to and from the airport, and at 10 euro pp return is good value.
Lastly, there is a lot of work being done with scaffolding outside most of the front of the hotel. This did not impact on our stay at any point.
I can't comment on the restaurant or bar as didn't use either.
We would stay again.",5,2017,03,03
228,Shame ...,"Arrived this evening to find a cleaning cloth in the floor - I know that these things happen but not a great start.

There is scaffolding all around the building at present and no direct access to the car park but hopefully all this will be resolved for the future.

Rooms nicely refurbished but still it is essentially Jury's Inn with anew name.",3,2017,03,03
228,3 night stay through Tripadviser,"A lovely hotel in a very good location,our room overlooked the river Liffey,great service, food and cleanliness,the only very small ""gripe"" we had was that there were no biscuits to go with the tea making facilities,a nice shortbread would have been nice.Scaffolding at front of Hotel but does not cause a problem
Thank you for a very pleasant stay in your lovely City",5,2017,03,03
228,Great Hotel and Location,"We stayed here for one night in Feb 2017 for a hen party.  the staff were very friendly and helpful.  situated close to bars/restaurants - either a short taxi or walk away.  The breakfast was absolutely fantastic.  it had everything; from making your own waffles, all the fry items you could want and a great variety of cereal and juices. Will definitely be back here.",5,2017,03,02
228,One Night Stop Over for Business,"Check in was perfect. The receptionist said a twin room was allocated to me but asked if I would prefer a room with a double bed. Yes I did. 

The room had everything I wanted except the heating was on full blast. I ended up keeping the window open for most of the evening.

I had a lot of work to do that evening and found the Wi-fi to be excellent. Had a quick meal in the restaurant. Just OK but I was not expecting fine dining. The speed of service was good.

Had breakfast the following morning also - excellent.choices.",4,2017,03,02
228,Fantastic,"We stopped here in January, fabulous hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were fantastic. Very clean and the beds were super comfy! 
Would highly recommend, good location for central Dublin.",5,2017,03,01
228,"Good Stay, But","The Hilton Garden Inn is nicely situated along the Liffey River, a short walk away from city center. The staff is very welcoming and accommodating. Our room and bathroom were clean and comfortable; however, after we checked in we found that the cooling and fan systems were not working throughout the entire hotel due to ongoing renovation. A room fan was provided, and after we opened the windows, the room began to cool down. To stay cool enough, we needed to sleep with our window open, which made a noisy night.",4,2017,03,01
228,"Overheated, noisy, and a building site","On arrival, was told that the hotel was currently a building site and noisy due to refurbishment. This became obvious when scaffolding was erected outside during the stay.  Room was far too hot, and noisy. No A/C, and staff could not control room temperature, so the only solution was to open the windows. This made the room EXTREMELY noisy, as on the first floor overlooking the street - loads of traffic noise and drunkards outside. A colleague on the other side of the building suffered similarly being above the bins. Windows banged open and shut during the night, making sleep very difficult.  Water pressure in shower extremely disappointing.  The one time I ate in the evening I was brought the wrong sort of chips, which to be fair were replaced swiftly by the right sort of chips; however these were undercooked so inedible. Waiter was kind enough to offer a complimentary glass of wine after this, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place.  In general staff were friendly but couldn't actually do anything about the problems.  This hotel should have been shut during its refurbishment, and is by a long chalk the worst Hilton branded hotel I've ever stayed in. Do not stay here, at least until the refurbishment is complete.",2,2017,02,25
228,Building Site,"This hotel is excellent but it is a building site for the next 1 year with lits of builders and workmen working between the hours of 10 am till 6 pm daily. But this hotel is only 10 minutes away from Temple Bar and the main shopping streets on foot. Bus stops outside this hotel direct to Airport, only taken 15 minutes .
A excellent clean hotel and modern. Excellent breakfast with everyone catered for ",5,2017,02,24
228,Fantastic hotel in great location!,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during February for a long weekend. It's location on the river is lovely, just a little further out of the main area but everywhere was in walkable distance. Rooms are of a high standard and bathrooms too. The breakfast...well i could write an essay on this! Everything you could ever want and more, including an egg station and waffle makers, it was fantastic. We had a fabulous stay at the hotel, until the last morning when we went down for breakfast. Unfortunately we were sat next to the builders who were working on the hotel and the language they used was eye opening to say the least. I never knew you could use that may 'F' words in one sentence! I would highly recommend  this  hotel if you are going to Dublin, just give the builders a wide birth at breakfast!",5,2017,02,21
228,"Clean, good-sized rooms, great breakfast","We enjoyed our stay here with our family, no regrets. The room (#244, 2 queens) was generously sized. We upgraded our reservation to include breakfast and their breakfast offerings were wonderful, suited everyone in the family. It's a short walk to O'Connell Street and then you're right in the hub of things like Trinity College, Grafton Street, etc. We used & appreciated the workout room, business center, dining room. Our room had TWELVE places to plug in a USB cord which was awesome since we came from USA and only had a couple of outlet converters. Everyone's phone was quickly charged!",5,2017,02,21
228,Business Stay in Hilton Grtden Inn,"Attended the Dublin Tech Summit in Dublin last week and stayed in the Hilton Grtden Inn. Staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Rooms were spotless with lovely fluffy towels and crisp white clean bed linen. Chilled and relaxed on my time there.",5,2017,02,20
228,Modern hotel in convenient location,"I was in Dublin to attend a conference at the Dublin convention center only a short walk away. The location was ideal for the conference and also a 10 minute walk away from temple bar and the city center. The rooms are modern and comfortable. Breakfast is also nice with plenty of options. There is a fitness room, although quite basic and a laundry room. Finally, a snack bar in the lobby is convenient for some snacks if you need any. Staff were helpful on check-in but didn't deal with them much after that. Overall, would definitely recommend a stay here.",5,2017,02,19
228,Billy connolly,"Stayed here for billy connolly concert on friday night. Hotel is well maintained and well staffed. Room was perfect, no street noise Id like to mention the breakfast manager cant remember his name, we didnt fancy a big breakfast, he noticed and made sure we got coffee. He read our minds.
Great job.
Cant wait to return.
Darren",5,2017,02,19
228,Nice comfortable hotel .,"This hotel is so convenient for a city break or in our case for going to a show in the 3 Arena which is just a 15min walk.
It's clean and comfortable and I was very impressed with the quality of the bar food and the friendly staff.  
The bedroom windows have an extra sheet of glass on top of the double glazing which means you cannot hear the traffic from the street below.  A face cloth was provided in the bathroom which so many hotels don't have anymore which really irks me,  No extractor fan though ?   Overall , enjoyed my stay and I would stay again.",4,2017,02,19
228,Great hotel definitely worth a stay!,"We stayed for 2 nights with family at Hilton Garden Inn over mid-term. We booked two adjoining rooms with 2 adults  and 3 children.  Accommodation was excellent, clean, spacious and well equipped with all we could need. Free wifi, powerful shower and hairdryer, tea and coffee facilities, iron and ironing board.  The staff were excellent at reception and in the breakfast room and bar, they took the time to converse with our 6 year old and could not have been more helpful.  The hotel is situated in a fantastic spot close to many restaurants and central to local attractions by a short walk, just in front of the hotel is the quay which was beautiful to walk down at night with all the stunning bridges and building lights. The hotel is very impressive with attractive foyer and reception area, Oly's bar had some great lunchtime food deals with lovely atmosphere and welcoming ambiance.  Breakfasts were a good range of cooked and continental style breakfasts which really set our 3 hungry children up for the day exploring Dublin. All in all a brilliant visit in a superb hotel of great value. Looking forward to a return visit, maybe on our own next time!  We've visited the Zoo, local parks, Trinity College and GPO.  Next time Temple Bar and Guinness Brewery are on our list! ",5,2017,02,18
228,A great hotel on the Liffey,"Great hotel.  Very comfortable, with great views of river.  Always feel welcome and a great night's sleep. Good choice of meal and the bar is vibrant.  Very handy for getting into town from the airport or from Connolly Station.  Lives up to the Hilton Brand.",5,2017,02,16
228,long weekend without kids :),"First time visit in Dublin and our choice was to book a hotel by the rive. Hilton garden inn was a good choice. Room with river view, 5th floor recommended. Kind staff and helpful service at the frontdesk. Roomservice at all hours. Clean room and clean environment in all. Short walking to many restaurant & temple bar area. Taxi also available outside the door at all times. Bus/ Tourbus stop on the right side of hotel door.",3,2017,02,15
228,amazing staff,"we stopped at the hilton overnight on sunday 12th feb- we arrived in the morning of an early flight and wanted to leave our luggage in a safe room , the lady behind the desk went one better and found us a room already prepared so we checked in. the room was spacious with tv, fridge, safe, walk in shower with a comfy bed. the hotel is about 25 minutes walk from temple bar and the dublin airport bus stops directly outside, dont waste your money on taxis.we did the guiness storehouse a great day out, the shopping is also good. we had a meal in the hotel which was pricey but all restraunts in dublin are similarly priced.",5,2017,02,14
228,Improved selection,"A work in the vicinity of this hotel and have had occasion to have lunch there a number of times because of the proximity rather than quality or choice of fare.  I have to say though that much to my delight I had lunch there last week and the menu has changed, with a much broader selection with a range that will present a couple of choices to suit your taste/diet.  I had a really nicely prepared wrap, which not only looked appetising but was very tasty. My friend ordered a BLT which while very tasty was not your standard BLT in that it was not a sandwich - rather a role.  Nonetheless we both really enjoyed our lunch and the selection.  All in all a really nice lunch plate for EU10 (including fries).",4,2017,02,13
228,Hard to fault !,"Stayed here for three nights with friends. Arrived mid morning to be greeted by friendly, helpful reception staff who checked us in early. Our room was very modern, spotless with everything we needed for our stay. Large bathroom and exceptionally comfortable bed! Hotel bar area was warm and comfortable, friendly staff and reasonable prices. Now the best bit - breakfast ! Self service, but with endless choice and all top quality! Also a chef on hand to cook omelletes etc. This really set us up for the day.
Location of hotel is good with a view of the Liffey from rooms at the front. We were warned that some building work was taking place at the rear of the hotel but the noise was kept to an absolute minimum - not easy on a construction site!  Our room was at the back overlooking this but it did not affect us at all. 
Bus stop for the airport is right outside the hotel with railway station 5 minutes away. Main shopping district is 10 minute walk but beware the roadworks! ( new tram system)
Really couldn't fault this hotel and would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,02,13
228,Great!,"Stayed here for a few nights with a friend. On arrival we were offered a free upgrade. The room was a good size and comfortable. The location is really good with small cafes and restaurants near, by and a 15 minute walk to the center. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Really good for the price we paid.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.",5,2017,02,12
228," Brilliant",No complaints. This is a lovely hotel and the staff are so friendly and helpful. It's about 15 minutes walk along the river to the main city centre area. Only issue at the moment is the works going on and scaffolding/noise but can't really fault them for that. Would stay here again. ,5,2017,02,12
228,Wonderful,"Just returned from a two night stay with my boyfriend, honestly didn't expect too much as the hotel didn't cost me a lot of money to stay at... well wasn't i surprised, beautiful hotel in a fantastic spot and we even got a free upgrade! Free wifi throughout the hotel and a yummy breakfast to enjoy each morning. Two happy humans that will be returning on our next visit.",5,2017,02,08
228,Lovely hotel but..,"Had a great stay here while in Dublin. Good location and service was wonderful. And the breakfast! Oh so good! I did have a few complaints though. They did mention there was construction going on, fair enough, but I did not know that coming back to my room at noon for a little lie down (headache) would be a horrible decision. It sounded like 10 drills were about to come straight through my wall! Not very impressed. Also the wifi kept kicking me off. If you're going to have wifi, make it good.",4,2017,02,07
228,"Great Location, Lovely Hotel","Stayed here for 1 night and I can't complain in anyway.
Great Location, 10 min walk into centre. Bus stop for airport/ bus tour just right out side the door (when you arrive the airport bus drops you up the side of the hotel 3 min walk) 
Room clean, spacious had everything you needed (Toiletries, safe, fridge, hair dryer etc).  Breakfast excellent so much to choose from.
Nice bar to come back to for a night cap.
Would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,02,06
228,"Not bad , great location",The highlight of my stay was the quality and friendliness of the staff. The rooms are a bit tired and the shower a bit under powered. I personally didn't find the bed very comfortable but everything was clean,3,2017,02,05
228,Good base right by the river,"We stopped for 4 nights and found the staff very friendly and helpful. We arrived in the morning and the staff on reception got us booked in and stored our bags until the afternoon when the room was ready. 
We took the breakfast option and this was great value for money, buffet style with plenty options hot or cold. 
Our room was facing the river so you had a good view across to the south side of town. 
Right outside the hotel we found that there is a bus stop for the airport (No 747) this made it easy for when we left for the airport.
 We will use this hotel on our next visit.",5,2017,02,05
228,Convienient for business,"I stayed 3 nights during a sales kick off at the Dublin convention center. It is just a 10 minute walk from the venue and several restaurants are around. For downtown you need either to grab a taxi or walk for 30 minutes.
The hotel room was spacey enough, bath tub/shower, desk and a 2 queen size beds. Breakfast was better than average but I regret the limited choice in fruits and lack of fresh juice.
Check in check out were quick with warm staff",4,2017,02,04
228,Expectional Rooms,"We stayed here the first weekend in January, we could find no faults with the cleanliness and the facilities of this hotel, it has more than what we expected.  The hotel was a short walking distance to the centre of Dublin and had a tram stop around the corner and bus stops right in front, making it very accessible.  The reception staff were amazing we checked in early due to our flight landing at around 7:30 so got to the hotel roughly 8:30am, and our room was already ready this was such a lovely bonus we were not expecting and really made our first day as we could have a little rest before heading in to Dublin after the flight.  The breakfast was buffet and plenty to choose from, you could also have things like omelettes made to order.  the only downside to the hotel which was why it did not get 5 star was the bar staff, we seemed to be waiting ages every time we went to the bar the get a drink or to pay for the drinks etc that we had consumed, as well with the breakfast it took them ages to seat us despite seeing us being stood there, just seemed some of the serving staff couldn't be bothered, they were polite though just took ages!.  This was the only downside and would not put us off staying again as overall this hotel is great for the location and the amenities would definitely stay again and would recommend people to stay here.",4,2017,02,04
228,Nice hotel & close to everything,"Plus: the hotel is centric and walking distance to everything (max 1/2 hour), it's near downtown, near universities, near restaurants and near work hubs
The hotel is clean, causy and they serve nice breakfast .
Minus: rooms are not air conditioned   ",4,2017,02,04
228,"Dublin, Ireland. What if the Irish diaspora had already left before you got there?","Dublin, Ireland. What if the Irish diaspora had already left before you got there?

How would this affect your choice of hotel in Dublin? Well, for starters your need for a clean, well appointed, and economical place to stay, remains the same. More importantly though, given the circumstance, it is important to get yourself booked into a facility that knows and understands the effort required of the hospitality industry. You would then be interested in Hilton Garden Inn, Dublin Custom House. 

The hotel is in a slightly remote area of the city, in the North Dock area. Once thought impossible, this area from Sheriff St Lower and Upper, back to the River Liffey has undergone a series of sporadic new constructions, and your hotel sits here. New. Clean.

So if you were to take an amicable stroll from your hotel back toward the city, along the flat Custom House Quay Road that tags along-side the Liffy, go on down passed O’Connel Bridge to say Halfpenny Bridge, well then, you make your way back in time. As an aside, this is the first sign of a population gone missing. One starts reminiscing of another age, moving into folksong morbid and finally so grief stricken, as to slip into ‘the demented geographer’s dream’ (DGD), until now an undocumented condition. A most conspicuous affect of this disordered-spectrum, is the listing of places, of town names and perhaps a river or stream or hill or two. Alas the severely affected individual unwittingly excises people from mention because really, they are just too difficult to colour in, let alone describe.

On your exploration of Quay Road you find yourself dawdling behind a family group that has just arrived from Spain. In your halting understanding of the Catalonian accent, you can just make out their conversation for a place to eat. You too are similarly hungry and pop into the Asian restaurant run by a family from the Philippines. No interest is shown in the new customer, so you make your way to sit down, but the table is dirty and the menu is covered in sauce stains. Best if you don’t bother (apparently no one else in the establishment is either) and so you return to the front door to continue your survey of likely Dublin eateries.

Very reluctantly you make your way back towards Hilton Garden Inn. There must be somewhere else. Will hope triumph over fact. Not likely. There is the inevitable family restaurant. It’s furniture looks drab and dirty. More disappointingly, the proprietors are universally disinterested in the customers, with an attitude of, another replacement customer will be along soon enough. Several such episodes of that nonsense meant you are all too soon back at the starting point. 

At least, at 1 Custom House Quay Road, North Dock, Dublin, you can find a cheerful face, and a clean & well-appointed place to eat. The food was quite palatable, and most interestingly, just a hint of the Irish accent in the efficient lass who cheerfully converses with the customers. 

I wish you happy travels, through the very very green countryside, as you might journey via train down to Cork. Perhaps then, on to Killarney, with an anti-clockwise tour of the ‘Ring of Kerry’, and then a wee drive up to Limerick. Finally some adventurous back roads and tall lushes green roadside hedges will escort you all the way back to Cork. You get the point, it is all so DGD. 

Where have all the Irish folk gone? Sad. Now that is what you feel, a common enough symptom of experiencing DGD. Ireland is so beautiful, but you feel so let down. You naturally wander if all those folk that left did find somewhere nicer? I hope so.

Should then this travel advisory be sent to all the gorgeous Irish folk who are currently somewhere else? Perhaps the title might be, ‘come home, a tourist has arrived’. Until they get back, I suggest your first best stop off in Dublin, is at the Hilton Garden Inn, Dublin Custom House.",4,2017,02,03
228,Dublin... the return,"Very clean, comfortable room, nice view of the river, professional staff and a good location.  Access to tour buses or the bus to the airport right outside. An easy walk to Temple Bar area or some of the other newer areas of Dublin.  A very good hotel brand for consistent caring service.",5,2017,02,01
228,Nice hotel ,"Have stayed here a number of times when it was Jury's I found it slightly disappointing. booking in was fast and we were allocated our room. Room was at the rear of the hotel 5th floor. Room was ok no amazing view. Facilities were good no complaints. There having an extension built but I didn't hear any noise tbh. Breakfast was below par we were in the restaurant at 7 most mornings and the food was warm not hot. Bit of a let down if I'm honest. You could opt for omelettes and pancakes and these were cooked for you. Overall, was an ok stay. Tip : it's a good 20 min walk to temple bar buts it's served well by all the buses . Enjoy the scenery and walk. ",3,2017,01,30
228,Louise hen weekend,Lovely hotel. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff were always happy to help.  Excellant location on the river. Short walk to the Temple Bar area and shopping. Also close to some excellant local bars.,5,2017,01,29
228,An excellent hotel experience,"This hotel is very centrally located in the midst of all that is Dublin City Center. The hotel is well staffed and maintained.  Very courteous and helpful.  Breakfast was amazing with a full buffet of assorted breads and pastries, fruits, yogurts, omelette station, juices, etc. Front Desk staff was always ready to assist with any request.  Highly recommend.",5,2017,01,29
228,Hilton Garden Inn Dublin,"Great hotel for my stay in Dublin, centrally located with an easy walk to many of Dublin's attractions. Front desk staff very helpful recommending local restaurants and/or pubs. Best atmosphere for me was The Church, yes it's a 300yr old church that has been converted into a pub (main floor) and restaurant (gallery) with fabulous entertainment Sunday thru Wednesday.",4,2017,01,28
228,"Great Location, good facilities","Great twin room overlooking the Liffey, great morning view of the city. Room temperature, was a bit uncomfortable so slept with the window open. Would definitely stay again so handy to the Point Depot for concerts. Parking is subsidised and only pad €15 for the full night. Refrigerator in the room and everything you would need for a great stay in Dublin.",4,2017,01,27
228,Quiet and comfortable ,The Hilton Garden Inn Customs House was very quiet even though my room door was 20 feet from three elevators. The view of the river was great. It is less than 1 km from lots of fun places to visit and also includes a hop on/ hop off bus stop near the front door and a light rail station a block away. ,5,2017,01,27
228,Hilton Garden... good value,"Good hotel in good location. Friendly staff and rooms good size and clean. My second time staying here in a couple of weeks and bar/restaurant staff in particular are friendly and outgoing.  Only downside, renovations due to start !!",4,2017,01,26
228,Average,"I stayed her several nights last week. Par for the course for a Hilton Garden Inn but as other have noted, the temperature controls don't provide many options so prepare to sleep with the window open. Food and drinks were pretty good but bar & restaurant staff were consistently uninterested in providing acceptable service.",3,2017,01,24
228,Better choices available,"Stayed for one night recently and probably won't again. The location is good for the Bord Gais and 3Arena and a short walk to the city centre. Parking is available just around the corner but there is no direct access to the hotel, you have to go out onto the street. Check in was fine and lunch in the bar was good value. The room was a decent size but there is no Air Con so became quite stuffy. Toiletries and shower were ok. The staff on the evening shift seemed to be of the opinion that residents were a nuisance and were quite surly I thought. The bar staff were slow and disinterested and one refused to serve a drink to a lady at the bar, deeming her to have had enough already. I can certainly say that the lady in question was not drunk, or even close to it, in my opinion. I thought that the barlady was quite rude in general. Breakfast was average and not worth paying for with so many cafes in the area offering better choice and value. The carpark is €18 for 24 hours which is steep. All in all, there is better value to be had in Dublin.",3,2017,01,23
228,Lovely!,"Lovely hotel and staff cannot do enough to help you! Best breakfast served!!
Dublin a lovely city and the hotel is well situated to walk into the bars and shops, early check in was a bonus, so friendly and helpful staff would definitely go again!",5,2017,01,22
228,"Nicely renovated, great location","Stayed at this hotel in January. We were assigned to a nice twin corner room overlooking the river. Room was spacious. Breakfast and bar were nice, gym was modern. Staff professional and friendly. Only point of improvement would be to change the mattresses; they were not that comfortable.",5,2017,01,21
228,Good place to stay,"The Hilton Garden Inn Customs House is a clean, modern hotel in Dublin. Just located next to the financial center and 20 mn by walk from the center. For a business trip it is very convenient location.",4,2017,01,20
228,Great Stay,"I was traveling on business to Dublin. Stayed at Hilton Garden Inn as it's very close to my client office.

Being a HHonors member, was upgraded to a King Room with River view for free which was impressive.
 
Summary:
1. Good front desk - does the job quick
2. Rooms are cleaned everyday
3. Decent Breakfast. Good variety.
4. Large bed with all required amenities in the room
5. Good Wi-Fi connectivity and speed
6. Hotel is at a 20 mins drive from the airport (depending on traffic, can be slightly more)
7. Fitness Centre
 
Only sad part is there is no microwave in the room, unlike most of hotels in the US including Hilton.

At a walkable distance from the City Centre where all the action is.
 
Overall, highly recommended for business travelers, family as well as friends traveling",5,2017,01,18
228,Comfortable Hotel Close to Downtown and Business,This is a great location that isn't directly in the heart of downtown Dublin. Located on the Liffey River with a foot bridge across the street that is a short walk to attractions and downtown Dublin. I'll stay here again!,5,2017,01,17
228,Dublin Weekend Break,Room was ready on arrival early in the morning. Fast and friendly check in. Very clean and only a short walk to the centre. Airlink bus stop right outside hotel for trip back to the airport. Nice large bar area with a good selection of drinks at reasonable prices. Highly recommend staying here.,5,2017,01,17
228,Thanks HGI Customs House,"Cannot recommend this hotel enough. Patrick the GM and his team are terrific. Staff had arranged a Birthday Card and Chocolates on arrival for my sons 21st Birthday. We were upgraded to a River View and the rooms, bar, facilities and breakfast were excellent. I really cannot find a single fault. Fantastic location that is just far enough from the city center and tourist spots to be quiet and relaxing, however only a 10-15 minute easy walk to everything you will need to see and do in Dublin. I would 100% recommend this hotel to all, singles, couples and family. Thanks again guys, great stay !",5,2017,01,17
228,Great Location,Overall a great location for any stay in Dublin. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are comfortable and clean though could do with better heating control. Had to ring reception to ask for the heating to be turned on. Breakfast was one of the best we have had in hotel here. Would definitely stay again,5,2017,01,17
228,Great base for the city,"stayed here just after new year, hotel was clean and welcoming. we were given a complimentary upgrade with river view. all the staff were warm and welcoming especially the evening bar staff. breakfast is good with live egg cooking station.",5,2017,01,16
228,"Clean, decent location next to River Liffey","Stayed here several nights in Dec. 2016. Easy access to Dublin Airport, near bus line. A 20-minute walk to shopping areas. Starbucks nearby. Needs larger counter area next to sink in bathroom. Our room was small but adequate. Food in restaurant was good. ",3,2017,01,12
228,Great location and new rooms!,This hotel is in a great location on the river and only 10 minutes walking from the middle of the city (Ha´Penny Bridge and/or O´Connell Street). The location is also right next to a bus-stop and very close to Trinity College. The rooms are new and clean and similar to most other Hilton Garden Inn´s and all of the employees we interacted with were friendly and helpful. This is a great hotel if you´re looking to stay very close to the center but not right in it.,5,2017,01,11
228,ireland,Fantastic staff didnt use as much of the hotel as id liked ! Stayed for two nights on fifth floor always helpful and on hand to help at any time. We stayed first weekend in january.  It was just what we expected of hilton first class!,4,2017,01,10
228,HGI Custom House delivered,"Our stay was really enjoyable largely due to the caring and attentive staff at this hotel. This is a HGI property, no mistake, same amenities, but it is clean and well located if you are ok being a short walk from downtown. The service from the staff, from front desk to housekeeping and restaurants really was far above any HGI I have stayed at and really enhanced our stay in Dublin. I would definitely recommend this property.",5,2017,01,09
228,For our anniversary ,"We are currently still here in Dublin, we came Friday night for 2 nights for our anniversary! I cannot fault the hotel one bit, it is spotlessly clean, the decor is modern and the staff cannot do enough for you especially the young guy on reception who is extremely helpful! We didn't arrive while late on Friday night as our flight was delayed but on arrival we was told they had upgraded our room for us to a king room with a river view which was really nice, the room was modern, clean and the bed is big and comfy! We didn't eat at the hotel so I couldn't tell you about the food but  everything else is spot on! Overall we have had a brilliant time here in Dublin at the Hilton hotel and would definitely recommend it to friends and family! If you are thinking of coming to Dublin i would definitely tell you to stay here! If we come back to Dublin again anytime I would stay here again! ",5,2017,01,08
228,"Convenient, Clean, and Friendly","We stayed at the Garden Inn for 5 nights on holiday for nye.   The Garden Inn was a perfect place to stay.  The rooms are very comfortable, modern and clean.  We had a great view of the Liffey River.  The front desk staff were super friendly and accommodating.  We really appreciated the early check in and late check out. Thank you!  Breakfast in the restaurant was delicious- there was an omelette station and lots of other options.   It was about a 10 to 15 minute walk to most sites, which was not bad at all.  The bus to the airport stops right outside and the red line tram is just a block away.  It was a great stay!",5,2017,01,08
228,Very pleasant stay.,"Very pleasant and helpful staff throughout the hotel.
We were in a very nice room, (526), which overlooked the River Liffey.

Good range of food in the bar area.

Standard buffet style breakfast, with a very good additional service, in the form of a Chef waiting to make you an omelette or waffle to order.   I liked that.

Hotel is about 10-15 walk from O'Connell street, and about the same from Grafton Street.

Car parking is just around the corner in a private multi floor car park, which runs at 18 Euros each 24 hrs, provided you validate your ticket at hotel reception.

The Bord Gas theatre is approximately 10-12 minutes walk away from the hotel.

The 3 arena, and the Point are approximately 15-20 minutes walk from the hotel.

All in all, a perfectly situated hotel, to access all the benefits Dublin has to offer, with excellent all round service through out.

Looking forward to a return visit.",5,2017,01,08
228,"Clean, friendly and a good location ","Stayed solo in the Hilton Garden Inn this past weekend and had a great experience. The hotel is very clean, with helpful and friendly staff. I checked in with ease and was surprised by my room being of better quality than the Jury's which was the previous hotel here.

Room was great, spotlessly clean. Shower excellent and nice towels etc. 

The location of this hotel is excellent if you are arriving in Dublin from Busaras. It's a lovely walks along the liffey and about 7mins to the O'Connell St bridge. From there you're in the city centre. As a solo female traveller attending a gig over in the opposite end of the city, I took a taxi to and from my location. Happy to report that there's a taxi rank outside the hotel and my return cab was just over €10 and that was stuck in nighttime traffic.

Would absolutely stay again and thanks to the very friendly front of house staff which were so welcoming and friendly. ",5,2017,01,08
228,Friendly and welcoming hotel ,"We stayed for a long weekend at the start of January for our wedding anniversary and couldn't fault the service. We called ahead to say that it was a special trip and upon arrival we had our room upgraded to a king size room, overlooking the Liffey and we also had a card & chocolates from the staff left for us in the room. 

The beds are comfy and rooms decorated to a modern standard with everything you would want from a modern hotel. 

The only reason for a 4 star review is location, it is in the financial district which means a 15 min walk to the sights on the south side. Also, there isn't a lot of choice of restaurants or bars near the hotel. 

We have loved our stay here and would look to book here again in future. ",4,2017,01,07
228,Brilliant,"New, clean and exceptionally well thought out. Love it. Location is superb, staff extremely helpful and the rooms very comfortable. Free wifi is ok but a little slow - it's free though so can't complain too much. Overall, good value for money. ",5,2017,01,06
228,Weekend away,"Lovely room! Really big and comfortable bed. The only slightly negative feedback I would give is that the shower & tiles looked a bit old compared to the rest of the room, although they were clean! Polite and very friendly staff. We arrived at the hotel many hours before check in time as we had an early morning flight (I think we arrived at approx. 9am!). The staff were very polite and allowed us to check into our room hours before we should have arrived as a room was empty, they didn't make us feel this was an inconvenience at all. I traveled with my partner and the hotel was perfect for us - we wanted to be reasonably close to everything but not quite in Temple Bar! The location is good. The breakfast was tasty and a good variety of food was available. Another plus is that the hotel has a Costa! If in Dublin again I would happily return. ",4,2017,01,06
228,Right on the Liffey ,"We stayed for 2 nights over the new year at the Hilton garden inn and took a bit of a risk on this hotel as it is situated in the docklands area a little bit out of town. 

We need not have worried about the location of the hotel which was right on the Liffey and within 15 minutes walk of the temple bar and shopping areas. 

We booked the hotel online using a corporate code and decided to go for a river facing room as we were there for new year. I emailed ahead to ask for a quiet room on a high floor which was no problem at all. 

Our room was on floor 4 with a beautiful river view and right on the end of a corridor so was nice and quiet. The hotel was absolutely immaculate and check in and out was easy and without any problems. 

Our room was very clean and cosy with all of the usual Hilton added extras you would expect and we had a bath and shower in our room. 

The hotel isn't the most central but is well within walking distance of the usual city attractions and being that little bit out makes it nice and quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the city and also near to the 3 arena (walking distance) 

I would have absolutely no problems staying at the Hilton again",5,2017,01,06
228,Quiet Location on the River,This was a nice hotel across from the main section of Dublin center city but within easy walking distance and one block behind the hotel was the convenient tram line and a 3 minute walk to a DART station.  They are a bit stingy with towels and soap but upon request we got what we needed.  The breakfast was more than sufficient each day.  The workout room is a bit sparse.  The family room was a good size but the king room was on the small side.,4,2017,01,05
228,Friendly service and excellent breakfast buffet,"Overall, our stay was a good one. The location is very good, right by the Liffey and about 10-15 minutes to O'Connell street and the main shopping areas. The hotel is what you would come to expect from the Hilton Garden Inn chain. I have stayed in better HGI and worse. The rooms are somewhat small compared to US versions but are comfy with new furnishings as far as I can tell. The only issue we had during our stay was during the first night the pipes filling the radiator were very loud and woke us 4-5 times during the night. Maintenance came by the next day and we were told this was normal, especially for this room as it was a corner room (516). We took up the offer to move next door for the next three nights and interestingly there was no noise at all from the pipes. As we were on a high floor, we did not experience any noise from the road. The breakfast buffet is excellent, especially if you like a hot breakfast. The staff were very friendly and the fitness centre, although small, was good enough for a decent workout. Compared to the other Hilton chain hotels, this one is great value, especially for the location. Will likely return.",4,2017,01,05
228,Girls night away,"I had booked this hotel via promotion before it changed from a Jury's Inn to Hilton Garden. They honored my booking at the same price with no issues. We arrived earlier than the advised check in time but the staff at reception checked us in early as there was a room available which was great as we could drop our bags and head out. Hotel was neat and tidy, its in a good location but then again i know Dublin City quite well. Its close to the main train and bus stations. The breakfast was very enjoyable, i particularly liked the make your own waffle section. I would stay here again.",5,2017,01,05
228,Good hotel in a great location,"Overall a nice experience, with good tidy rooms and a great location right by the water. The rooms are spacious, the service is top class. The hotel restaurant is not very good as the dinner we had seemed like a microwave dish, but no worries, plenty of good restaurants nearby.",4,2017,01,05
228,Christmas Shopping,"Room was excellent. Location is good, about 10 minute and you are on O'Connell at his statue. Parking was a little sketchy, not clearly marked. Breakfast was good, but not a real variety. Need a little change every day to add variety.",5,2017,01,05
228,Good Location,Stayed at this hotel with our kids and grandkids. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to Trinity College. The hop on hop off bus stop is 50 yards away. The value of this hotel is reasonable. They have a good breakfast buffet. The lounge at night was good also. This hotel has no AC.,5,2017,01,04
228,Value for money,"Hotel is well located in the heart of the city, with all attractions within walking distance, and just beside the IFSC and the National convention Centre. O' Connell street is less than 5 minutes walk. Car parking is at a discount rate of €18 per day, and is to the rear of the hotel, but not part of the hotel, as it is a private car park. The rooms are well light, clean, and of good size. The beds are large and comfortable. Climate control is not available in rooms, but windows can be opened. A very decent breakfast is available with a good choice. A small gym room is on site, near the reception area. No pool facilities. Overall it was very good value and a place I would recommend to anyone to stay in.",4,2017,01,03
228,Check status of a/c before booking,"We stayed here for 5 nights in December 2016 while I was at a meeting at the conference center, two blocks down the road.  We booked with meeting rates and got a good rate that included breakfast.  I recommend the hotel with one rather big concern:  the room was overly, at times uncomfortably warm.  When we asked how to make the room cooler we were told to turn the radiator down, or even off except that it was already off when we checked in.  You can crack the window, and it was 40degrees outside, but it is a very small crack and not enough air can come in to compensate for the overheating.  We must not be the only ones to complain because there was a small portable room fan in the closet.  We used it and it allowed us to sleep comfortably.  Without it, we would have been uncomfortable.

On the positive side:  everything else.  We took a taxi from the airport, about 30€.  We could have taken transit, and an airport shuttle stops directly in front but decided to take a cab as we were close to 24 hours without sleep and preferred not to have to fuss with luggage or extra walking.  Location of the hotel is perfect if you are going to the conference center and pretty good even if you are not.  The hop-on hop-off also stops directly in front of the hotel and the historic part of the city is a reasonably short walk.  Staff was exceptional:  knowledgeable, courteous and helpful.  Breakfast was reasonably good.  I have had much more elaborate European hotel breakfasts but this one had all the basics in a generous way.  There was a typical bowl of scrambled eggs warming under a light but they also had a station where you could get a fresh omelet or eggs prepared by order.  There was also a buffet with sausage, Irish bacon, tomatoes, beans, shrooms and a small selection of cold cuts, cheeses and fruit.  Yogurt, several breads and baked sweets completed the spread.  The hotel has recently been remodeled and it feels pretty fresh.  The towels are as large and fluffy as any I have used in any hotel.  Also, the shower is a full tub with a full shower curtain on a bowed out rod.  There is a small fridge in the room.  I enjoy having self service ice machines in hotels in the US and miss that in Europe however, this hotel has a machine for guests to use in the lobby.  It was especially useful as our room was so warm.
 
We spent our first week of two in this hotel.  We were on to Stockholm from here and getting our laundry done was a worry because we learned on TA that there is only one coin laundromat in all of Stockholm and it is nowhere near the hotel we were planning to say at.  Much to my surprise and delight, in the elevator there is a directory of what is located on various floors and it listed a “guest laundry” on the lobby level!  There is a laundry room located across the hall from the gym.  It has one washer and one dryer each with a 30 minute cycle.  You buy tokens from the front desk, 3€ for the washer and 3€ for the dryer, laundry detergent included.  So we were able to depart Dublin with clean clothes and not have to search for laundry facilities, or hand wash in the sink, or pay 10€ to have one pair of jeans laundered in the next hotel.

So checking out, I asked the staff how they managed to have guests in the summer without air-conditioning.  They said that the warm rooms have only been a problem since the big remodel and that they were in the process of air-conditioning the whole building.  So if I return to Dublin, I would certainly consider staying at this property but only if I checked with them and found that the AC was installed and working.",4,2017,01,02
228,"Modern hotel, but cold bathrooms and no AC","Staff are very friendly at the hotel. The room we stayed in was recently modernised and in very good shape. Unfortunately it didn't have AC (which I'd use to keep the room from getting stuffy), so we had to keep the window open a bit to let some fresh air in. Unfortunately the better rooms (river view) are also facing the road outside, so keep in the window open during the night doesn't really work well (but when the window is closed you don't hear a thing from the road).

The bathroom was quite cold and there was no way of heating it up. Service at the restaurant was fairly slow, and used plates were cleared away only after 10 minutes or so.

Overall this is a good hotel in a good location, definitely if you can get a good rate, but it's nothing to write home about.",3,2017,01,02
228,Great stay!,Stayed at this hotel on new years eve and we really enjoyed it. The hotel itself is modern and clean with spacious rooms and bathrooms. The bar/restaurant area shows live sports and is a great place to relax! The parking facilities at the hotel are really convenient and are at a great price for an overnight stay! The hotel is located on the River Liffey and is about a 15 minute walk to shopping and restaurants such as Grafton St and O'Connell St. Will definately return to this hotel if we decide on another trip to Dublin. ,5,2017,01,01
228,Great refurbushment,"Having stayed at this hotel many times when it was a Jury Inn I was interested to see what it looked like as a Hilton Garden.
The hotel has been renovated to an extremely high standard and caters very well to the modern traveller. The location is great and close to the 3 Arena and dockland district. The is a selection of good pubs and restaurants in the area too.

Parking is expensive but should be expected given its location. Also avoid the hotel breakfast, it is very expensive and there is plenty of breakfast options within a stroll of the hotel itself.",4,2017,01,01
228,Good value hotel,"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. Very friendly staff, very clean common areas, good restaurant which serves all meals, food of good quality. Hotel is removed from City Centre but because weather was good the 10 minute walk was not a problem.  Room and bathroom small and just basic. They do not have concierge.  As we needed two rooms, I chose this hotel becausse of reasonable price. ",3,2017,01,01
228,Great stay at a top class hotel,"We had a fabulous overnight stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. Lovely staff, room was great. And I must say the breakfast was absolutely top class the best we have ever had at any hotel. Very convenient for a show at bord gais theatre or 3 arena ",5,2016,12,30
228,Great hotel in the Garden Inn Collection,"Booked the hotel last minute before Christmas. I'm impressed with the refurbished look of the hotel. Rooms are simple but stylish. I'm always a fan of the Hilton toiletries. Not many of my TV channels worked, and connection to the wifi was not clear, but as I was only there for a night I wasn't much bothered. A lady from Italy checked me in and was welcoming and able to give me a king room when I only booked a twin. Much appreciated. Thank You. ",4,2016,12,29
228,Pleasant Stay,"I've spent more than 15 days in this hotel in the past one month, as I travel to Dublin frequently for work.   This hotel has a lot of positive points. There is a tram station 5 minutes from the hotel (walk straight out from the back doors). It's minutes away from a lot of the major offices in the area. The shopping areas in and around Jervais is also around 15 minutes away, with plenty of restaurants, and not to mention Temple Bar across the river. It would have been nice to have a good convenience store near the hotel, the nearest one is about a 10 minute walk away.    The hotel itself is very comfortable. It has nice and clean rooms. The ones on the side of the river have a pretty view from the windows. The full irish breakfast is also great, and I love the no nonsense internet service provided at this hotel.. reliable and fast. I also like the bar/cafe.   I'll be making sure I continue staying here in my future trips to Dublin.",5,2016,12,28
228,Lovely hotel and accommodating staff,"Stay here fairly frequently, always a pleasure. Great location, plenty of amenities near by, a 10 min walk to temple bar if you're a tourist. Breakfast and the bar are very good and the staff always very pleasant. Standard of rooms always very good. Will stay here again.",5,2016,12,25
228,Great hotel great location,Typical high level of service for a Hilton within great loacation to city center. Easy access to and from the airport. Great value for all the amendities and location. The restaurant was convenient on my travel days.,5,2016,12,24
228,Weekend away with the ladies,"The hotel was very clean and the staff very friendly and welcoming also very accommodating, we had breakfast and it was very nice lots to choose from,  good location, I would definitely stay there again if I went back to Dublin
",5,2016,12,21
228,Friendly staff and clean room,"The location of the hotel was excellent for me as I was attending a conference at CCD.  Also, if you go out to the rear door of the hotel, you'll get to the red line Luas station.  It is also very walkable to the busiest area of the town. The room was spotless, the staff members were friendly, and the breakfast was good.  I put the sign on the door and didn't let them clean for two days.  Then, I found extra towels and bath products hanging at my door when I returned.  They are very courteous and helpful in every way.  I recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit Dublin.",5,2016,12,20
228,Smack in the middle of everything,"A great place to stay if you want to get the typical first Dublin experience. Pretty much everything is within walking distance, Temple Bar, Guinness museum, even Phoenix Park if you fancy walking half an hour along the river.
The castle is just a block away as well as St Patrick's cathedral. Standard rooms to a decent price.",4,2016,12,19
228,A good shopping weekend,The Hilton is a great hotel in a great location and the staff are friendly and helpful. The breakfast is a great experience. The rooms are comfortable and well presented and there is a relaxed feeling in the hotel where you can sit back and watch the world go by.,5,2016,12,19
228,Great Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on Saturday 17th December.  We arrived at 10.30 am and although check in wasn’t until 3.00 pm, our room was ready for us which was a nice surprise.  Our room was a standard double, it was very spacious, spotlessly clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The hotel staff were all very friendly and very welcoming.  We didn’t eat in the restaurant so can’t comment on the food, but we had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar which had a lovely relaxed atmosphere.

The location of the hotel is excellent, it was just a 5 minute walk from Dublin Connolly station.  It has a nice quiet and calm vibe away from all the hustle and bustle, however a 20 minute walk takes you right into the centre of Dublin.

One thing we did notice, although it didn't cause a problem for us, was that the room was very warm, whilst you don't want a cold room, especially in December, we did find the heat a little overpowering, I would be concerned in summer time, although maybe the heating is reduced / turned up in accordance with the time of year and weather.

We would recommend this hotel and we will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,12,19
228,Great Hotel and a good vibe,"Checked in quickly and sat in the bar, there was live music and a great vibe. The food is very good, especially for a Hilton. The rooms were modern and clean. It's nothing special but its clean and practical.",4,2016,12,18
228,"Great Location, Central,","Very nice Hilton property, but it has a heating problem - the hotel is roasting. The rooms are comfortable, though the bathrooms are very small - I found it hard to get into the bath without hitting my feet on the basin. There are shower attachments, but the bath is very high to get into. Not that friendly - a walk in shower would be so much better. Breakfast was great.",4,2016,12,17
228,All good,Our stay was very satisfying. We were attending the Andre Rieu concert in the 3arena and it's a nice 20 minute walk along the river Liffey to the venue. Which was good after a great dinner. A welcome drink in the bar after a leisurely stroll back to the hotel. ,5,2016,12,14
228,Rubbish," I would not even let my dogs  stay at this hotel.

The bathroom was filthy, dirty flannels, with hairs in the bath and on the towels

 Please do not stay at this hotel, it is rubbish, I ordered taxi never turned up, and when I asked except cards they didn't

",1,2016,12,14
228,New and Modern!,This hotel is very modern and new. My room had a nice view of the River Liffey. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean and large. Best part is the close proximity to Grafton Street shopping and Temple Bar. Less than a 15 minute walk which is needed after a few pints of Guinness. ,5,2016,12,14
228,"Well-situated for convention centre, easy walking to key sites downtown","It's just a few blocks' walk to the Convention Centre if you have business there, but a bit longer - 20-30 minutes easy walking along the Liffey River to get to Temple Bar, O'Connell Street, and other sites. Staff were friendly, restaurant for breakfast was very good (omelettes to order, hashbrowns, grilled tomatoes, beans, sausages, breads, fruit, yogurt...). There's a microwave and coffee station in the lobby (no microwave in rooms like in the US). Room itself was standard, with refrigerator and outlets with USB charger built in so no need for a converter. Bath had a small tub/shower combo and good towels. I'd definitely stay here again.",5,2016,12,12
228,Got what we expected,Great location of visiting the city for a weekend. Clean and comfortable with friendly helpful staff. Taxi rank right outside so if we didn't feel like another walk it was no hassle. By the river so nice for the walk in to town.,4,2016,12,12
228,Gig in 3 arena.,"We stayed here last Saturday week, we were going to a gig in the 3 arena. For this it was a perfect location. Room was really clean  with what seems to be new furniture, tastefully decorated.  The bathroom was fully equipped with all toiletries (there was conditioner, which loads of hotels never have!!). We had a snack in the bar, food and drinks are expensive and parking was an extra €18. For convenience it's fantastic. Just not sure it was worth €169 for room only!   ",4,2016,12,11
228,central and nice staff,Former Jury’s Inn: I was under the impression this was a 4 star when i booked it but its only a 3 star which is fair enough. Good location and staff was really nice gave me also the requested room on top floor with river view. The room is large and quiet just matress plus pillow weren’t comfortable. Loved that they had iron and iron board already in the room. All what you need just all standard. Was disappointed with the breakfast as the quality of it wasn’t really good. The bread was try didn’t enjoy it. Not sure if i would choose this hotel again as the price was too high for this quality,2,2016,12,09
228,Perfect location and great service,"I have stayed in Dublin before, but this was my first at the Hilton Garden Inn.  It was conveniently located to the convention center, public transportation and an easy walk to Temple Bar area.  This hotel was completely on par with all other Hilton properties I've stayed at and have no complaints.  The beds were comfortable, even though I had a street side Quay facing room, the rooms were quiet when the windows were closed.  The bathrooms were clean and the overall room was comfortable.",5,2016,12,09
228,Great,"Christmas shopping Reception needs training on attitude but all other staff remarkable , especially the waffle chef on Sunday morning, rooms spotless, location brilliant for shopping, transport ideal location ",5,2016,12,05
228,Great hotel as expected.,"Really quiet and fully practical.spent 4 nights there.sleeping was outstanding (which matters for me in biz trips), gym was 24/7, breakfast was quite good (minus the coffee served.lack of options and poor quality)",4,2016,12,03
228,big step up,"Big step up from Jury experience. 
breakfast was very good 
rooms require another renovation to match downstairs
car park expensive at 18 euro
room price was 89 euro under Jury , now 160 which would be fine if parking was included",4,2016,12,01
228,IRE V NZ!,"The hotel has a great location. Its within walking distance to the Aviva stadium. Parking is convenient, right at the back door of the hotel 16 Euro for the night.
The room was spacious and well kitted out for our stay.
We also used the restaurant in the evening for a meal when we came back from the match and the food/service was great.
I would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,12,01
228,Very good business hotel,"Stayed at Hilton Garden Inn for one night. The overall experience was very good.

I booked online and pre-paid including breakfast. The cost was less than half some other similarly located hotels.

Staff were friendly. The rooms were fresh, cool, dark, quiet and very good for sleeping. Queen room was large and with a large bathroom. 

Buffet breakfast was good quality and lots of choice of hot and cold food.

Only downside was speed of service in the restaurant when I wanted a quick lunch. However, the soup and bread were very good.

Wifi complimentary and good quality.

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,11,30
228,Perfect for business,"Stayed here for 2 nights last week for a business trip. Perfectly located for a business trip to IFSC area. I stayed here once before when it was Jury's and said I wouldn't return again as I really was not impressed. Thankfully it's now a HGI and so much better than before! Rooms have been revamped to a high standard, spacious and good internet supplied. Great breakfast too, thanks HGI, I'll be visiting again! ",5,2016,11,29
228,Not returning,"This is the second time myself and friends stayed in this hotel. We had the same issues in the summer when we were hours waiting on three bedrooms to be ready bare in mind checkin is at 3pm we were there at 3.15pm and not one room was ready. We only returned because in the summer we were compensated with a free breakfast and we thought we would give them a second chance.
This happened again when we were waiting for our rooms to be ready. We eventually got into one room an hour later to be told that the other two rooms will not be ready. This hotel is not cheap so its not unreasonable to expect your room you  paid for to be ready. The fact that this was the second time to happen wasn't acceptable. The staff didn't seem to see understand how inconvenient this was to a group of seven women who only had one night to explore dublin. Eventually after one of us expressed we wouldn't be returning we were offered a late checkout. 
Definitely not giving the hotel a third chance.",2,2016,11,27
228,Perfectly fine for a Dublin visit ,Stayed here for a weekend to see the rugby and the hotel is ideally placed for walking into Temple Bar and the rugby also.  Small rooms - and not what you would expect from a Hilton - but the breakfast was good enough.  One issue was that there was no concierge service which was unusual and unhelpful.  ,4,2016,11,27
228,Central and convienient,Stayed for one night on B&B basis as it seemed close enough to the O3 Arena where we were attending the Rod Stewart concert. The reception process was effortless and we were into our room within a few minutes of our arrival. One unusual observation at reception is they do not accept visa-debit as a charge card apparently you need to have a credit card for this. However as we had prepaid it was not necessary but it should be noted if you intend to charge for additional service on your room card .  They have a key-less room entry smart card which must also be used to operate the lifts. The Red LUAS line which goes directly to the O3 or into the city center can be accessed through the rear of the hotel (George's Dock). It's just a short walk from the back entrance gates and so convenient. All in all a very relaxed stay an a fully stocked breakfast buffet. Bit pricey but then again it's Dublin and good value can be had if booked well in advance....,5,2016,11,24
228,Good business hotel,"If you are in town on business or are looking for the hotel close to CCD or IFSC, then Hilton Garden Inn is your choice. Proximity of Dublin attractions such as 3Arena and Temple Bar and easy access from Airport (airlink bus route 747 literally stops in front of the door) is another advantage.",4,2016,11,22
228,Cog1,Service very poor and drinks prices extremely expensive. Celtic tiger prices are back here again for sure.location is good. Rooms were clean and tidy. I doubt if I will be staying here again. Have stayed several times but not as good as it was.,2,2016,11,22
228,Would stay again,Close to 3 arena. Luas line close by. Extremely friendly staff. Room was beautiful with fantastic views of the Liffey. Food wasn't great wouldn't recommend restaurant but every other element was lovely and I would stage again.,5,2016,11,21
228,Ok for one night stay,"If staying any longer,3adults in one room is not very comfortable. Double bed way too small, single bed was fine, we got very little sleep. Rooms were roasting on 4th floor. We left window open all night even though it was minus degrees outside. ",3,2016,11,21
228,Business in Dublin,"Clean, efficient, friendly staff.   Staff always helpful, gave local map pointed out sites and provided walking directions.  

Nice restaurant but food menu could improve, was a bit bland.  Had fish and chips.  

Had business shirts laundered.  Came back clean but wrinkled and not pressed properly ",5,2016,11,20
228,Modern and good location. Awful restaurant!,"Rooms were nice and modern.. everything you need in standard room.. comfy bed, iron, hair dryer, kettle, TV, safe, fridge etc. Nice modern foyer. I have to say however.. the restaurant was AWFUL! I'm not one to complain, and never have in my life, but the service was a joke. My mum ordered a bacardi while we waiting on food.. I ordered a vodka. Out came a bacardi and a gin. The waiter was gone by the time we realised and we waited for about 15 mins with no one coming near us so I decided I would just drink the gin instead. We waited 55 mins before asking a waitress if our food would be any longer. Straight away our starter came out.. I think they forgot about us until we asked! Mum had a chicken caeser salad which was literally a plate with a few leaves, croutons and awful fatty bacon. No chicken to be seen. It was cold and like something a 2 year old would throw on a plate. Mum asked why there was no chicken in the ""chicken"" salad. The waiter who had such poor English didn't understand what she meant. So mum gave up and just asked him to take it back. I said they also got our drink order wrong previously. So he apologised and came down the the ""correct"" drink.. another gin! I stated it was a vodka I had ordered.. again he didn't understand! So I gave up. Then.. i was still eating my soup for starter (which wasn't great) and a waitress came with our main!! I said I was still eating my starter and she just stared at me and continued to put the plate down even though there was no space and I was still eating my soup.. the main was cold by the time i started to eat it. I could go on.. but you get the idea. It was awful. Breakfast which was 14 euro each also wasn't great... don't get a fry.. fatty bacon, undercooked sausages, cold eggs and beans. The selection of everything else was quite good though. I probably sound like a fussy person but I'm really not. It was so disappointing! So maybe stay here but DON'T go near the restaurant.",2,2016,11,20
228,More than welcoming and in a terrific location,"I liked the looks of the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House when I walked past it in July so I decided to give it a try on my next trip to Dublin. My impression is very positive. HGI Custom House has the typical amenities of HGIs everywhere. That includes standard rooms (no suites), cheerful if familiar décor; comfortable beds and linens; plenty of towels and soaps; a writing desk with a good desk chair (a must for me); and a pleasant and diverse cooked breakfast. What made this property stand out were the service and the location. The front desk staff led by Sharon were accommodating and detail-oriented both on the phone and in person. I was able to confirm a room for 180 Euro at the front of the hotel on a high floor in hopes that the room would both be quiet and have a nice view. Both were true. The staff also went out of their way to do all the little things that make for a pleasant stay: print a boarding pass; provide late checkout; ask if I wanted to be billed in Euro or in dollars (not asking is a major annoyance at other hotels and businesses in Dublin); and answer questions about local restaurants. The HGI’s location is very convenient to the train station and the Airlink bus to Dublin Airport. The airport was less than 20 minutes away by taxi on a Friday afternoon provided you pay 10 Euro for the airport tunnel. The location is also very convenient for walking around Dublin. There were appealing pubs, coffee shops and sandwich shops nearby and passable restaurants. Though not in the historic center, the hotel compensated by having a beautiful view of the harp-shaped Samuel Beckett Bridge over the Liffey designed by Calatrava. The only potential issues I saw were that it took a couple of minutes to get the hot water up to the fourth floor and that some noise might be heard from other rooms on days when the hotel is full. These do not deter me and I will very likely be back.",5,2016,11,20
228,New fresh and nice,"Newly refurbished hotel. Fresh modern interior. The rooms are of descent size for being in Europe. The bathroom a bit on the smaller side. 

Nice staff at the front desk. Professional, friendly and courteous.

They have a full fledge bar on the premises. Great breakfast. 

Great location.",4,2016,11,20
228,Excellent ,"My husband & I stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is spotless & the staff were very helpful & friendly. 
This was our first stay at a Hilton but definitely not our last. Many thanks to s great team 
Great location away from the hustle & bustle of the city centre 
",5,2016,11,19
228,Newly Refurbished Gem Hotel,"We stayed in this newly refurbished Hilton property Friday and Saturday night and liked it very much.  Previously a Drury Inn, it was completely rennovated in June, 2016, and joined Hilton as a Garden Inn.  It is very modern, sleek and shiny inside, with a great reception area and inviting and warm dining area and bar.  The staff were all very friendly, professional and authentic.  The buffet breakfast service had a wide range of choices, decidely (for me, at least) the best breakfast of any HGI I've visited.  The bar was not the usual cheesy-and-limited lobby bar, this was a full fleged bar, with 10 beers on tap and equipped to prepare any drink concoction imaginable.  Rooms are on the small side but in line with European standards.  Rooms were well lit and sparkling clean, with high threadcount linens.  Towels were absorbent and soft extra large bath sheets.  Why only 4 stars:  The temperature of the room was exceedingly warm and control in the room is non-existent, handled by an old-fashioned radiator.  It was 10C outside and we were boiling hot in the room.  We opened the windows to get some fresh air and alas, it didn't help, because we had booked a room with a river view and the loud sounds of traffic and very large crowds of young people walking in front of the hotel soon made us close up the windows.
Parking tip:  If you arrive with your own car, use the parking garage along the street adjacent to the hotel.  Enter the hotel from the ground level door that says ""This way to Drury Inn"".  The Hilton Garden Inn will validate your parking ticket reducing the price by half to 18 Euros.  Don't forget to pay at the ""Pay Station"" on the ground floor before you return to your car to exit.

Location tip:  It is a 20 minute walk to Temple Bar across the river, nice views along the way (river, city), if it's nice weather.  But if it is cold, windy or rainy we would take a taxi.",4,2016,11,19
228,"Hilton Garden Inn , Dublin",Good location on the Quay halfway between O Connell Street and Dublin Port . Parking is in private multi-story carpark at rear of Hotel - with Hotel stay you get 50% reduction. Hotel has nice décor and decent bar. Internet is free,4,2016,11,15
228,Perfect for the 3 arena,"Travelled down from Belfast and stayed on Saturday night past in order to attend a concert in the 3 arena. Very handy for this as it's on the same side of the road about 15/20 minutes walk. Milano Restaurant and Eddie Rocket's just down from the hotel if you fancy some food outside of the hotel as inside is a little pricey but that is just standard with Dublin. 

Hotel is lovely and modern, 'Pantry' area opposite reception with fridge stocked with cold drinks, hot drink machine and snacks available for purchase. We stayed in a double room on the 2nd floor overlooking the river. Mini fridge is in the room and room service available. We didn't go for breakfast so can't comment on this. Modern bathroom with shower over the bath. Double bed very comfortable. 

On the Sunday we walked into Dublin for shopping - O'Connell Street and Grafton Street are about a 15/20 minute walk from the hotel in the other direction from the arena so it was handy for everything we needed. There is a multi story car park behind the hotel - Drive in and get a ticket, reception in the hotel will validate it when you check out. Overnight 24 hour rate is 18 euro. 

Would definitely stay here again and have recommended to family & friends.",5,2016,11,15
228,Dublin break,"We had a lovely stay at the Hilton Garden Hotel, very easy to find from the airport, it's a good location for Dublin centre, it was a great break. The staff were very helpful, friendly and a very quiet relaxing hotel. ",5,2016,11,14
228,"Clean, comfortable and great location","I have enjoyed staying at this hotel twice now, and always found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The rooms are a good size, especially if you are a business traveller. The food and is good and my room service dinner was delivered quickly.
The rooms do not have mini-bars, though there is tea and coffee facilities. But in the foyer is a series of fridges and cabinets that contain snacks, drinks and personal items that you may need. 
But by some standards, it could be considered expensive when you consider no mini-bar and no concierge service.",4,2016,11,14
228,Nice place to stay,"Nothing extra ordinary but very nice.
Good rooms and reasonable prices.
Relatively close to Temple bar (10m walk).
Very clean rooms and friendly staff as would expect from Hilton.
Nice location by a river.",4,2016,11,12
228,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Highly Recommend","Having stayed at this hotel last weekend with my 8 friends I would highly recommend it. Hotel is lovely, staff really helpful, rooms are clean and well presented. The location is great, over looking the River, walking distance to many places as well as on the tram line. Breakfast is amazing. Felt very welcome by the staff. Great value for money, we had three rooms with three adults in each room. Will definitely stay again.",5,2016,11,09
228,Nice hotel in good location,"Stayed here on business. Rooms were spacious and clean, and the bed was comfy. Didnt eat here so unable to comment on the food. Not a bad location on the quays, and price was very reasonable for a city centre hotel.",4,2016,11,08
228,Comfort and Convenience,This is a very convenient hotel position right on the water front and just 15 min walk to the shopping and bar region. The hotel is very clean and modern in the furniture. The Breakfast was included in the rate and they offered a full buffet that include make your own waffle bar.,5,2016,11,06
228,Great hotel,Former Jury's Custom House hotel. Completely redone with great ammenities. Workout room was great as was the full buffet breakfast. Only downside was lack of air con but not a big deal in Dublin as you can open the window and turn on the fan. Good location a bit outside the tourist zone so quiet but easily reachable via bus (bus stop right outside front door). Airlink from airport also drops off right outside!,5,2016,11,04
228,Excellent Dublin Trip,"Stayed at the Hilton Garden Court Customs House. The stay was excellent, friendly staff. Great buffet breakfast with a large choice which they kept filling up.
Wifi was free and works really well.
Thoroughly recomended",5,2016,11,02
228,Mrs,All about getting more money. Breakfast 14 euro!!!!!!!!! Explained by reception that all was prepaid and breakfast included. Then to demand 28 euro in restaurant. And then as for another 20 euro on leaving.   How embrassing in a crowded area.,1,2016,11,02
228,Great hotel in great location,"I stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn with my family last weekend as I was attending a concert in the 3 Arena on Saturday night.
For our purposes at least, we found that the hotel was ideally located as we had travelled to Dublin by train to Connolly station and the hotel was only a few minutes walk from there.
The 3 Arena is also not far from the hotel, so it was the ideal choice for us.
The hotel itself was lovely and fresh and the rooms were very well finished and beds were very comfortable. 
We did not have dinner there, but breakfast was great and there was a large array of foods to choose from.
All staff were very welcoming and professional, and the whole hotel was very neat and tidy.
We all enjoyed our short stay at the hotel, but we did agree that we would stay there again if / when the need arises.",5,2016,11,01
228,"Good Location, Great Service","Stayed a few days for our honeymoon and it was definitely a good experience. The room was large, clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The b-fast wasn't included and we had to pay it on the day we took our Game of Thrones tour (the bus departs from here), and it was a bit pricey for what it included.

Even so, Temple Bar is about 15-20 min walking time and my favorite Celtic Pub is about 10 min away. There's also a metro stop towards the back of the hotel. This train is super convenient and takes you around town - we found the Guinness Storehouse fairly easily. The staff is super nice and will provide a map and info.

Overall, a great experience and a reasonable price. We would probably stay here again.",4,2016,11,01
228,Excellent location and immaculate hotel,"This hotel is ideally located for the centre of Dublin. On the main bus route of the 747 bus to and from the airport for ten euros return. Ten minutes easy walk into Dublin centre. The hotel was immaculate on every respect. A million pound refurb programme has taken place and it shows. The breakfast was the best part, make sure you try the waffles they are to die for. On my wife's words the best breakfast she has ever had in any hotel, and we have stayed at plenty. Well done Hilton Garden Inn a superb hotel!",5,2016,11,01
228,Great stay,"Clean, well located,very friendly staff, delicious breakfast that hotel went out of their way to start early to accommodate all the marathon runners that we're staying, free wifi and the car and restaurant was really nice",5,2016,11,01
228,Nice and quiet hotel at a central location,"Great location just one block from the custom house but away from the most noisy part of town, great view of the river and within walking distance of all the major attractions, there are many restaurants right next door to the hotel in a small shopping mall, be aware that the breakfast buffet is open from 7 AM so if you are leaving early for a tour you will miss it.",4,2016,11,01
228,Staff friendly hotel,"Great location - easy access to many different areas of the city.  Extremely friendly staff - can't do enough for you.  Room nice and bright, warm and clean.  Nice breakfast - with good variety.    Would stay again and recommend to friends.",5,2016,11,01
228,"Nice, good service and excel location.","Previously a Jurys Inn hotel, it had turned to Hilton´s but nothing much else has changed. Fair and clean. Very nice service and restaurant. Breakfast also suitable. For work travel do not need more than affered.",4,2016,11,01
228,Great stay you get what you pay got,"Stayed recently we arrived at 930am and we were able to check in which was great
The hotel has been recently refurbished and is of a very high standard 
The beds were very comfy and great new bathroom
It's about a 15 minute walk into the temple bar area along the river 
Hotel is a great choice, good location, thought it was expensive but we stayed on a bank holiday Halloween weekend so to be expected 
",5,2016,10,31
228,Great location,"The location is perfect for walking around the city. If you walk at a good pace you can be in the temple bar region in 10 minutes. A more leisurely pace will take 20 minutes. 

Hotel is modern and clean. The only complaints are regarding the room temperature. It is very warm. I understand AC is getting installed next year which should fix this problem. ",4,2016,10,31
228,Concert Break,"Stayed in hotel for two nights for Status Quo concert at Three Arena.  Staff very welcoming on arrival and access to room immediate.  Room overlooking river was clean, bright, cheerful and modern. Corridors and public ares well maintained, bright and cheerful. Location close to concert venue and to main shopping areas.  Parking at adjoining public car park was expensive even at discounted rates for residents. Free Wifi connection  worked well in room.  Had evening meal and breakfast in Olys restaurant and the food was of good quality for both meals.  All staff members that we encountered were very pleasant and willing to give assistance.  The hotel was quite busy with concert attendees and Dublin Marathon participants, but there was generally at calm and peaceful atmosphere.  Would certainly use this venue again!",5,2016,10,30
228,Long weekend ,"Stayed here as a family of 4, very nice hotel. Facilities were excellent staff were very friendly and very helpful, with the Luas tram right around the corner, bus stop right outside ideal when visiting Dublin.",5,2016,10,30
228,Good spot for ferry catching,"If you want to catch the ferry the next day and leave your car in the parkade overnight while you wander the streets this is the ideal spot.
This must be a relatively new hotel as everything is in fine condition. The staff were friendly and ready to serve.
We booked a room for three and ended up near the back of the hotel. Unfortunately, there was an adjoining room where we could here a man snoring half the night. Did not seem the hotel was swamped so I am not sure why we were placed side by side.
Anyway, this certainly was a very nice place to stay on the fringe of the action.",4,2016,10,28
228,Nice clean hotel with all amieneties,"Ideally positioned with a bus stop right outside for easy access to the airport. 15 mins walk to the temple bar and city centre. 
Easy hastle free check in and the lobby area is very smart.
We had a twin room which comprised of two double beds (very comfortable)
The room included a free safe, a large flat screen tv, fridge and tea making facilities.
The room was spotlessly clean and all the fitings and fixtures appeared new. (It looks as if the hotel has recently been refurbished)
The only thing I can find to fault with the hotel would be the noise from the road outside which means you cannot have  the windows open if you want peace and quiet. 
The hotel also boasts a small restaurant and bar area, a gym and coffee shop.
I can heartily recommend this hotel",5,2016,10,28
228,All Basic Needs are Met,"Stayed here for two weeks in September on work trip. 

Rooms are comfortable with good level of hygiene. In-room dining available with additional surcharge for delivery, so you might as well just dine in the restaurant. Bar is available. Hotel is located in IFSC, makes it convenient for many who have meeting is this area. About 15minutes walk to Henry Street. Take a nice walk by River Liffey to enjoy the beautiful view of Dublin. If you're here during October, Octoberfest is just next door.

Facilities available: Business Centre (complimentary), Gym, Self service laundry, restaurant with bar.",4,2016,10,27
228,Great stay,"Very convenient by Airlink 747.  Was able to check-in early with the very helpful front desk lady.  Steps from Luas station still within Central Zone 1.  Slightly far to walk from Temple Bar IMO, maybe 25 minutes leisurely.  Quiet with window closed.  We were staying in Oct so weather was somewhat cool.  Decent sized room.  Got a Hilton Flash Sale deal so was excellent value.

One point off mainly because water pressure and temperature in bathroom was not ideal.  Be careful if you need to leave for the airport from this hotel if by bus 747.  This is almost the last stop outbound and the bus would have been packed by then.",4,2016,10,26
228,Comfort,"Very easy check in ,modern clean facility, friendly staff, room was quite spacious and very comfortable bed , slept like a baby great comfort.Breakfast was a surprise with much to choose from. Location central to lots of attractions.LOTS  to do and weather was sunny and cool.Over looking River Liffey.
Three minute walk to tram station.",5,2016,10,25
228,Horrible customer service.,Horrible customer service. Front desk lady was rude and not expect this kind of customer service. I'm Hilton Honors Diamond member ... still I got very bad service.  I been staid so-many hiton hotel at different places. This is worst hotel....  Don't recommend this hotel at all. Need to change front desk staff....,1,2016,10,25
228,Comfort for a conference,"I attended a conference at the conference centre, which is extremely convenient to walk to from the hotel. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable, and do have windows with double window which block out noise if necessary or can be opened if necessary. Breakfast is excellent and even on weekends has an 7am starting time which is better if one is going to a conference early. The hotel is also situated fairly close to the city centre with a 20minute walk along the river.",4,2016,10,25
228,Girls birthday weekend,"Stayed here with friends for a birthday weekend in October.  Lovely hotel, staff were very helpful and accommodating changing our rooms so we could be next door to one another. Breakfast was delicious all you can eat €14 continental €9. Great Base for town centre, 5-10mins taxi from temple bar.  Would stay here again and recommend it to anyone!",5,2016,10,24
228,Excellent hotel in Dublin!,"Stayed 3 nights before our coach tour began.  Travelled with a friend from work and it was a super great room - huge with each of us having a large double bed in an ""L-shaped"" room, so beds far apart. 

One of the best breakfasts we had.. terrific selection.  We booked when it had not yet had the ""Hilton"" branding - so paid extra at the time of booking (10 Euro) for the breakfast, so not sure now whether it comes with the room or not.

Very, very close to Tram (used it to go further afield to Guinness Storehouse) and the Dart (used to go to Malahide to join tour).  

Very clean - loved it was right on the Liffey - easy to find... just find the river and walk, so never got lost in the city.  About a 15 minute walk to the historical area (so about a km and a half or so).   

It was too hot in the room BUT got two fans (one for each of the beds since so far apart in this large room) - so all was good.  

Only bad thing: no heat in the hair drier.  Bring your own. 

Great service at front desk and at breakfast.  Would absolutely stay there again.",5,2016,10,24
228,Wry comfortable and close to CCD,"Stayed here for business conference at Convention Centre Dublin. An easier walk. Breakfast ha do lots of choices, and excellent food for buffet style. Rooms clean and very quiet. Amenities in the room adequate. I would stay here again if back for a conference or holidaying. ",4,2016,10,24
228,Modern hotel in Dublin IFC,This former Jury's Inn has become a Hilton Garden Inn.  It is a very nice place to stay and convenient to the center of Dublin (O'Connell St.) and the IFC. Trinity College and Temple Bar are also within walking distance.  The Luas tram is behind the hotel.,5,2016,10,22
228,"Lovely hotel, well located","Stayed here while touring Dublin for a couple of days.  The hotel has been recently renovated and the rooms are tastefully decorated and well appointed.  Hilton recently purchased the property and is still working on bringing it to standard, so as of now there is no pool or air conditioning.  All rooms are provided with portable fans though.  The lady at the front desk (Vesta, Vezla?) was super helpful during our stay as well.  Breakfast was delightful with many choices.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2016,10,19
228,"Nice location, nicely renovated","We spent two nights at the hotel after dropping off our rental car at the airport at the end of a 9 day trip through Ireland.  The hotel was nicely renovated, and the rooms and common areas were nicely done.  Our room overlooking the river was clean and efficient with a comfortable bed.  The location was close to all the places we wanted to go, from the theaters, to Trinity College, to St. Stephens Green and Temple Bar areas.",5,2016,10,18
228,Great hotel in the middle of Dublin,"The Hilton Garden Inn looks like it went through a recent renovation and feels like a brand new hotel. It is well-decorated with helpful staff and clean, well-equipped rooms. I would stay here again if given the chance. I did not get the breakfast rate, but tried it one morning for the $14 USD fee. It is a buffet with full Irish breakfast items plus continental options and an omelette bar. The taste and quality is very good with several options and the staff are friendly and helpful.",4,2016,10,18
228,Birthday Weekend,"Dublin was a friendly, lively place to visit.  It lived up to everything that I imagined Dublin to be.  Temple Bar area was brilliant but The Celt (traditional Irish bar) was even better.  Definitely will return to Dublin.",4,2016,10,18
228,HGI Dublin great stay,Great staff comfortable location at a nice location on the Liffey in the Docklands. Proximity to the Customs House and new museum made the location good and a short walk to most attractions in Dublin.,5,2016,10,18
228,Great base for my stag do,"My best man looked at a lot of hotel options whilst planning my stag do to Dublin and this is the one he settled on. Location was the main reason but the price was also great, although we did book early so i dont know how much it increases the closer to your date. 
Location wise it was ideal. About 25min transfer from the airport, ideal to get on the beers quicker, and then about a 15min walk into the temple bar area for all the pubs and clubs. Its close to a lot of attractions too, we went karting and to the Guinness brewery, both of which were under 20mins by taxi. 
Inside, the hotel was very smart, particularly for the price. We thought we might have been at the wrong spot before check in. The rooms were very clean and airy whilst also plenty big enough for 2 adults with two double beds. The bar is open until 1.30am and although we were a stag do we werent rowdy and it was a nice area to chat and organise the nights out whilst having a couple of beers. Breakfast wasnt included in our room price just to allow the older people in the group the option of going out to get something. Personally i had the hotel breakfast both morning and loved it. Continental option, full fry up option and theres even an omelette station which i visited more than once! 

All the staff were very friendly and helpful, i really want to praise them from reception to cleaners and all the bar and restaurant staff.

My fiancee wants to see Dublin and i will 100% look at this hotel for a city break. Dont be put off by us being a stag do, the groups that were there were all into their 30's at least and not once were anyone, including us, ever disruptive to any other guests. This place would be great for all travelling types.",5,2016,10,18
228,Still filled with Nostalgia,"Hilton Garden Inn is conveniently located in the city center. It is very easy to get around Dublin from this beautiful Hotel. All Buses, including the city tour buses make a stop right outside the Hotel.
The rooms are elegantly designed to suit holiday cum business needs. Very empathetic room service staff who ensure the room is always very clean and fresh.
My stay at Hilton Garden Inn was remarkable, and should I return to Dublin, God willing, I will put up in the same hotel. I give the staff 7 star for service delivery..",5,2016,10,18
228,Nice hotel with water view,Great few nights in this hotel. It was right on Canal so great water view. Try to get corner room view is spectacular. The hop on hop off bus also comes right to the hotel so that's nice perk. Awesome Staff and breakfast is added bonus. Would definitely come back!,5,2016,10,17
228,"Very good hotel, friendly staff and very good location","Its a very nice hotel in a very good location close to the financial center IFSC, with a lot of restaurant around and at 5 mn by walk from Temple Bar.
Staff are very friendly and warmly welcome you.
Gabriella in the restaurant is always smiling which makes you very comfortable !",4,2016,10,17
228,My Hilton stay at Custom House in Dublin,"Had a lovely time, thank you for a convenient, comfortable, clean and safe experience. So easy to get to and from the airport and train station. And so many wonderful places located within walking distance ",5,2016,10,17
228,Visit to Dublin,"We have stayed in the hotel when it was a Jury's hotel because of its location to the centre of Dublin, which is just a 15 walk oblong the Liffy. The airport bus 747 stops just outside the hotel so is convenient for the airport too. Staff very pleasant and helpful, would stay again went visiting Dublin.",5,2016,10,16
228,Great Location in Dublin,"I stayed here for 3 nights during a pre tour and 2 additional nights on the post tour.  This hotel was a Jurys Inn and is presently being renovated up to the Hilton family standards.  I was traveling solo and the room was of ample size, although a little on the small size for two people, but workable.  Room was clean and fresh with a nice bathroom.  Coffee & tea, refrigerator and regular amenities  The hotel has a gym, business center and self service laundry room (which was very nice).  This hotel is located a few streets from the convention center and on the Liffey River.  The airport bus stops right in front as well as the Green Hop On Hop Off tour bus.  The staff were attentive and friendly.  A BIG thank you to Patrica at the front desk who was extra special.  There currently is no A/C in the rooms, but seldom needed in Ireland.  Fans in the room and an open window is all you need.  It is my understanding that they are renovating starting in Nov 16 where the top floor will be removed, rooms added and re-roofed with central air added.",4,2016,10,14
228,"Great stay, great room with great view, great staff. Just great.","The hotel is very well located close to the city center and attractions, such as Trinity College, Dublin's Castle, Temple Bar, etc. 
I got a room with a stunning view of the river. The staff has been very attentive and professional. All positive.",5,2016,10,14
228,Relaxing,As I have stayed at many Hiltons I always know what is to be expected from this established chain. I found it to be much the same however what I found here was the friendly staff. They made our stay so much more special and as such I would stay in this hotel again. Thank you,4,2016,10,14
228,Crackin',Nice central location - friendly helpful staff - food and drink excellent value for money - ease of access - bus stop nearby - lots of quirky pubs nearby - would definitely stay again when next in Dublin,4,2016,10,13
228,Review,"Very happy with everything, I have stayed in this hotel before many times and it's been excellent on every occasion, I'm very pleased with all levels of the hotel and have no complaints, having the car park is a massive bonus ",5,2016,10,13
228,The Restaurant is always worth a visit,"I'm lucky enough to live quite close to this hotel and when the opportunity arises to sample lunch/dinner then we are happy to do so!

Lunch usually runs from 12-4 and then dinner from 4. The dinner menu is always full of interesting choices and the ingredients are fresh and hand prepared daily. The prices are also quite reasonably and the portion sizes are quite generous.

Our selection consisted of Pan Seared Sea Trout and it was prepared to perfection, moist fish and crispy skin, what more can you ask for? The Green Pea and Shrimp Risotto was very light and in plentiful supply. The only thing I would say is, depending on your personal preference you may or may not want parmesan added. 

The Fish & Chips were delicate with a light and crispy batter, the chips you could tell were hand prepared and the Tartar Sauce had a nice bit of kick to it. Dessert consisted of what was supposed to be White Chocolate Brownies but what appeared on the plate was a regular Chocolate Brownie, not a problem as it was moist and full of flavour. 

My dining partner ordered a white chocolate cheesecake which was so sweet she had to change it, I know white chocolate can be sweet but that was way too sweet.. Thankfully the brownie was more than satisfying and the Raspberry Gelato that came with it was a real palate cleanser.",4,2016,10,10
228,Great hotel in a great location - when the price is right,"I stayed here earlier this year and the price was reasonable. Parking was easy, wifi was free and the room and comfort level were excellent. I've not been able to get the hotel for similar price since so I tend to pass it by. ",4,2016,10,09
228,Very Good Hotel in a Great Location,"Stayed for two nights and liked every minute. There is no air conditioning (yet?) but there was a small fan available in the room.  One strange quirk was the availability of ice... you had to get it in the lobby area and only in a Styrofoam cup quantity; no ice buckets available. The availability of a guest coin-operated laundry was a real plus after being on the road for 8 days. Unfortunately they only have one each washer and dryer (note to management: there is room for more!)  Unlike most other Irish hotels we visited during our stay in Ireland, this hotel had washcloths available in the bathroom.",4,2016,10,07
228,Top notch hotel a little on the pricy side,"The room was definitely more than we would have liked to pay for one night, but accommodation is expensive in Dublin and we definitely got what we paid for. Super comfy beds, large TV, clean shower and bathroom, pretty decent free wifi, plus a great view of the Liffey.",5,2016,10,07
228,"Great location, mix of quiet but easy access",Great location if you want something quieter than the hustle and bustle of Temple Bar and don't mind a super short walk to get to the touristy areas. We really enjoyed the location and had great view of the mountains and the Liffey. Took us no more than 6 minutes to walk to temple bar and once we saw how busy temple bar was at all hours we definitely appreciate out hotel not being there even more.  ,5,2016,10,06
228,Very unprofessional service and not a good night's sleep,"We had selected a room for three people (a couple and one single person). Unfortunately the bed for two people was not a standard size, or at least it felt like a lot smaller. It had only one duvet for two people, as well. When I called the reception and asked for an extra, they delivered us a BLANKET. (The Indian looking guy that came up totthe room had very poor English skills.) There was some noise coming out of the windows that were facing the road in front of river Liffey, so I did not get a good night's sleep. We had to pay extra for the breakfast, but that was of good quality at least. When I tried to give feedback in the Morning, the receptionist got my e-mail address and said that they would get back to me. They never did. One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had.",1,2016,10,06
228,Great hotel in excellent location.,"We have stayed at this hotel 5 times when it was a Jurys Inn. Let me just say that Hilton has done a fantastic refurbishing of this hotel! The rooms are spotless, the beds have been updated, fluffy pillows and duvets are so comfy. We brought German friends here for 5 nights, their first trip to Ireland, and they were very well pleased with the amenities and location (5 min walk to Trinity College, the National Museums, and Stephens Green). Hotel restaurant and the breakfast have also been positively upgraded. Wonderful visit!",5,2016,10,05
228,Lovely staff.,"Great location. Friendly helpful staff. I was very disappointed on arrival to find there is no room service for breakfast.. So we didn't have any breakfast before leaving next morning. If I had known I would not have booked this hotel..

228,A Good hotel,"The room was a decent size (Queen room), fresh towels were provided every day if wanted. Large TV, coffee and tea making facility. Shower was ok but felt like it needed modernizing...shower curtain appeared quite old. Bed was comfortable and room was nice and warm. Wifi was good.  ",4,2016,10,04
228,Excellent stay at The Custom House,The location was perfect. A 5 minutes walk to the train station.  The buses left right from the hotel. We arrived at 9 am after an overnight flight and the staff was able to get us into a room within the hour instead of 3pm which was such a nice surprise. The staff was vertu nice and helpful.  Overall our stay here couldn't have been better!,5,2016,10,04
228,Fantastic 1 night break!,"Could not recommend this hotel enough. Fantastic service at reception (thank you Marty), beautiful hotel, breakfast delicious and all staff so helpful. About a 10 minute walk out of the Temple Bar centre which was perfect to 'get out' of the nightlife. Would highly recommend.",5,2016,10,04
228,What I needed,This hotel was exactly what I needed. A place near the conference center with free wifi access and breakfest. All of this was perfect. The bed was clean. My room was near the road but it didn't disturbed me. Maybe because of all the beer I drank before. It helped to sleep a lot !,5,2016,10,02
228,Way over priced,"Rooms are comfortable and clean. Hotel location is good for the 3 arena. The hotel is way over priced though. My sister and I stayed here for 1 night and paid 90 euro each just for the bed. Breakfast was an extra 15 euro each and parking was an extra 18 euro. Altogether that is 230 euro for 1 night.  As I said previously, way over priced ",2,2016,10,01
228,What a treat,"After a week and a half traveling around, it was quite nice returning to this place for the last few days in Dublin. 

Large room and comfortable bed. 

Very friendly and helpful staff. 

Breakfast is super and so much better than most places except maybe the Gresham. 

Highly recommend this place even if a bit away from the hot spot destinations. They are a short cab ride away. 

Lovely views of the river mate this place even nicer.",5,2016,09,30
228,Visit to Ireland,"Had a great time in Dublin, to be able to return to The Hilton was very pleasing.  Staff are polite and friendly, and extremely helpful.  Breakfast was more than we needed. Everything was clean and good.",5,2016,09,29
228,Comfortable & Efficient,Stayed here while attending concert. Perfect location. Rooms very comfortable and modern. Arrived late and got booked in and room service in minutes. Bit pricey but I suppose it is city-centre Dublin. Careful about the name though - I always knew it by previous name of Jurys Custom House Hotel and its still referred to as this on numerous on-line web sites. Hotel said they emailed but not so. Only for asking Taxi driver we would still be walking around looking for it.,4,2016,09,29
228,Great place to stay,"Lovely hotel. Lovely staff. Lovely rooms. Can't fault it. 

Stayed here when it was Jury's Inn & hoped it would be the same & they didn't disappoint. We had a room with breakfast included, I can't think of anything that you would want that wasn't available on the breakfast (which is self service) the staff are very attentive with keeping everything topped up & fresh.

The rooms are very tidy and again lacked nothing. The bed was made & towels tidied each day, & the coffee, tea & milk were refilled too.

One thing I like is that you need to use your room key to access the lifts & stairs, which makes the hotel feel more secure.

One slight downside which the hotel couldn't avoid was the noise from the revellers on their way home from the Oktoberfest which was going on a few doors down from the hotel during our stay. One way to minimise this would be to request a room at the top of the hotel.

All in all a great stay at a great location. Close enough to walk to the main attractions of Dublin, but a nice distance away too",4,2016,09,27
228,Great location excellent value very comfortable bed,Arrived at 1:15am from Athens smooth check in but got to room card did not work! Husband had to go back down and get it fixed. Room was a corner room which was lovely as we had great views over the river and you can open the windows which is wonderful. A card and chocolates were waiting for us which was sweet but found out later (after we had eaten them!) they weren't for us but for our newly wed son and wife who had flown in early from the wedding in Santorini. (note to staff check). Breakfast was really good and the chef cooked poached eggs on request perfectly - very friendly staff. There is a self service laundry and dryer on ground floor wheck guests can access which was very handy. (lost a star for mess ups),4,2016,09,26
228,Not the best in the Family,"Chose this hotel for my business trip on its location and being an Hilton Honors member. The hotel is fairly new and I believe taken over form a Jurys Inn. Easy taxi ride to the hotel from the airport and a speedy checkin experience even though I arrived late evening. The room was fresh and of an average size. The bathroom size was average but the real problem was the shower pressure. This was nearly non exsistant and it was a struggle to get washed. I am not sure if this was a one off but I was on the fourth floor and it was hopeless. The other issue which I noticed was no air con. I had a corner room which I could see getting very hot on a sunny day and all that you had in the room was a desk fan. The windows did not open either. Good service in the bar area and very accommodating. Breakfast was of a good qulaity and plentiful all be it the dinning area was a strange layout, tables all over the place and of all sizes. Not sure if I would return, especially when warm.",3,2016,09,26
228,Excellent value and lication,"I choose this hotel based on its location, price and being a Hilton honors member. I was extremely happy I did.  It was easy walking distance to the tourist area and right next door to Dublin's Octoberfest.  The hotel looks very new inside and out, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The price was excellent considering the location and I felt the value was outstanding. This will definitely be my go to hotel in Dublin.",5,2016,09,24
228,Usual Hilton standard ,"Excellent location, comfortable rooms, friendly staff - what more could you want in a hotel. This Hilton delivers them all. After staying in small guest houses and hotels during our tour of Ireland it was good to have a few days in an anonymous hotel!",4,2016,09,24
228,"Friendly, but too noisy","First time staying at this hotel (I usually stay at the Conrad, but it was sold out).  Room not air conditioned so tried to sleep with the window open.   But the road noise was intolerable, especially the metal plate in the road that vehicles were constantly hitting.  Rooms were quite expensive this past week due to a local event.  Way over-priced.",2,2016,09,24
228,"Nice hotel, helpful staff","Stayed here for a week whilst working in Dublin. It's a clean hotel with spacious rooms. There is a good selection for breakfast and in the evenings there are complimentary cakes at reception. Also bottles of water and sweets, crisps, etc available to purchase to save going to find a shop. Wifi was decent and worked well in the room. The only pitfall for me was the restaurant is expensive, food is nice but it's very expensive for what it is.",5,2016,09,22
228,Reunion Trip to Dublin,Stayed here on Friday for central location near everything. Hotel was great rooms were spotless and breakfast was amazing... Could not fault...could walk to anywhere and central bus station just 10 mins walk away😊,5,2016,09,21
228,Below Hilton Standard,Checked in for 2 nights with family. Room was very small for a family with triple bed.Shaving mirror was two low and ended up with back pain after shaving. Reception staff Marty was very helpful and hospitable also bar maid was really friendly and professional.Check in and out was very easy.Front Office Manager had forgotten my special request which I made  during the booking..I expected more as a Brand loving  customer.,3,2016,09,21
228,Not a place I could recommend,"We had a 2 night stay in late August 2016 and with the weather being very warm, we found the room to be very hot without anyway of being able to alleviate the heat in the room except the small desk fan, which was very noisy and we could not even open the window (the small amount possible) as we were positioned above a bus stop. The bath was very dangerous very high with little leg room for showering.
On the plus side, the hotel contained a guest laundry and the reception staff were very helpful when we asked for a replacement fan, which they said was not possible but we were then offered a different room, which we accepted as it had a quite fan and away from the bus stop.",3,2016,09,20
228,"Immaculate and friendly, but shower presssure needs some attention.","Great hotel, immaculate with really friendly staff. Check-in and out was effortless.

We had a room on the top floor, there was no water pressure in our shower, which was hugely disappointing.

As Hotel as only just rebranded, Taxi drivers, which we used a lot given location, all struggled to know where it was. It's useful to know it's previous and also closeness to the customs house.

",4,2016,09,20
228,Hilton Garden Inn,"It's a Hilton. On the river. Just east, as in five-ten minute walk of temple bar and central Dublin. Beds, room, service, breakfast buffet are all great. Only downside is the ceilings are low in the top level and no aircon in those rooms or level. So you need to open a window and use a fan. That is the only downside.",5,2016,09,18
228,Decent location,Just checked out yesterday for my last night in Ireland. It's on the River Liffey.  Good lunch and breakfast. The hop on/off bus stops right in front of hotel. Rooms were clean and comfortable but tub was narrow...felt my feet were slanted when taking a shower. Some construction going on next door that we could hear through the rear window.,4,2016,09,18
228,Thoughtful renovation,"My husband and I recently spent over a week at the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House and really liked the hotel.  Check-in was easy with a friendly and helpful clerk; check-out was similar.  In fact, one of the very nicest aspects of this hotel was the consistently friendly, polite, and helpful staff.

We learned that the hotel was recently renovated, and it looks like the renovation was done with a lot of thought to traveler needs.  Our king-bed room was attractive and of adequate size, especially for a city-center hotel.  Furnishings included a desk unit with refrigerator, safe, and (only) two drawers; comfortable desk chair; easy chair; and side table.  There were night stands on each side of the bed (a big plus!) and each had electrical outlets and USB ports; there were also outlets and ports at the desk.  The only glitch to the thoughtful planning for management of all the devices of today’s world was that the alarm clock on one nightstand had a plug so large that it blocked the USB ports, though with some unplugging, replugging and jiggling, I could plug in both the clock and a charger. The room lighting was excellent, and the drapes blocked the early morning sun effectively.  Wifi was available throughout the hotel and worked well.  The bathroom had a tub/shower unit with adequate (not terrific) water pressure and plenty of hot water.  Counter space at the sink was limited, but the two glass shelves above provided a little more room.  The sink was deep with a stopper that worked properly, which made hand washing of clothes easier.  Our room was clean when we arrived and was cleaned well each day.

The one major problem with the hotel was the lack of air-conditioning.  The room had a plug-in fan, which helped.  Opening the window helped as well, but at night, street noise made it necessary to close the window (and the windows blocked street noise very well; another plus!).   This was a real drawback to staying at this hotel in the summer.

Breakfast was included in our room rate and/or because of our Hilton Gold status.  It is served buffet style with a made-to-order omelet station as well.  The omelets were good and service was pretty quick.  The buffet includes the makings of a full Irish breakfast; it also has cereals, yogurts (but not always plain), fruits, cold meats and cheeses, breads, pastries, and a waffle-making device.  The several small dining areas could be very crowded and staff had to work hard to keep the buffet stocked and the tables cleared.  The coffee machines seemed to be broken often, probably because groggy breakfast eaters impatiently pushed the button multiple times, expecting the large machines to do more than make a simple cup of coffee (but that was all they did or at least all they were programmed to do).

The hotel has a coin-operated washer and dryer.  Tokens (€3 per machine) are available from the reception desk; detergent is provided at no additional charge.  This was a very handy feature except that the dryer did not dry our clothes very well.

We liked the location of the hotel, on the north side of the River Liffey.  It took us about 15 minutes to walk to the city center (Trinity College area) across the river.  The LUAS tram runs behind the hotel with a stop about a block away; it was useful for getting to some outlying areas of the city.  There are convenience stores and some restaurants in the general vicinity of the hotel.

We really liked this hotel and fault it mainly for the lack of air-conditioning.  It’s difficult to understand why such a thoughtfully designed 2016 renovation would not include this feature.  Still, on balance, we had a very nice stay.",4,2016,09,17
228,beautifull,had the time of our lives when we stayed at this hotel.was my daughters bday and they went the extra mile for accomadation was so clean and comfy.we will be staying here again for sure.its not far from the main town taxi 10 euro,5,2016,09,15
228,We enjoyed our stay!,Just a bit expensive. Other than that it was a really good place to stay. Staff was helpful in every question we had and also very willing to please. Breakfast was awesome. It had every thing you would wish for. Hot items were hot and cold items were cold.,5,2016,09,15
228,Nice hotel,"Good location with friendly service, the rooms were decent and comfy but very much a business hotel. Lovely  breakfast with fresh waffles. 

Wish they had some more healthy snacks in the reception  but that's just my opinion! 

Love Dublin and the people and this hotel was no expectation!",4,2016,09,14
228,Big help at a bad time,"While I was on vacation in Ireland I broke my ankle badly. The staff was wonderful - they got me a wheelchair to use during my stay, moved us to an accessible room, and were kind in every way. The room was very nice. Some people have complained about lack of AC, but that is the case in Ireland generally, as it is rarely needed.
I will be going back to this hotel when I return.",5,2016,09,14
228,Great Staff & Location,Always stay here when travelling on business. Staff are exceptional and standard of hotel is very high. Great location for business and for leisure. Breakfast selections are very good and quality of the good is high. Highly recommended.,5,2016,09,14
228,"Terrific location, nicely-appointed","Within walking distance of the centre-city sights. Spacious lobby with restaurant; business center; fitness room. Very comfortable. Car Park immediately behind hotel with discounted rate for hotel guests. Thought rooms are small, would definitely stay again.",4,2016,09,13
228,Nice place in busy city,"Stayed 2 nights.  Hotel very recently refurbished.   Clean and parking nearby.   Breakfast was included in our stay and was full breakfast.   No air conditioning,  there was a fan in the room but not a ceiling fan.   The room was comfortable with the window ajar.",4,2016,09,13
228,No Points for Stay,"I was not awarded any points for my stay supposedly due to the fare class booked via 3rd party, which is simply not true, nor will Hilton resolve this to my satisfaction. This was not indicated at any time before or during my stay.",1,2016,09,13
228,Great rooms,This hotel looks like it was recently redone and it is lovely.  We had a family room with 2 full size beds and a lot of space for the kids to move (for a hotel room!).  The breakfast was expensive but very good.  Would return!,5,2016,09,13
228,Not what I expected based on other stays at Hilton properties.,"The room was fine but not what we anticipated.  There was no air conditioning and our room overlooked the garbage collection area.  Trust me, hotel staff were throwing glass etc away well after 9:00 p.m.    The real issue for us was that no one told us we had to pay for parking. A supposedly 50 percent discount was still an additional 15.40 on top of the 219.00 we spent on the room.   I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  There are other hotels that a less expensive with the same issues.  As a last comment, when we checked out we asked if there was a lift
To the parking garage and was told no but it was only four steps (through the garbage collection area) to the garage.  Well we have been traveling for three weeks so we don't have over night bags.  ",3,2016,09,12
228,daughters bday,"we was well looked after and they went out to make her bday special,thank you,we will be back soon.rooms where spotless breakfast was buffet exspensive but nice/cheaper to book your meals on line as it works out cheaper",5,2016,09,12
228,Pleasant hotel,"My only reason for not rating the hotel higher was the lack of air conditioning in the guest rooms. The weather was warmer than usual when we visited. The river view from our room was beautiful. There was about a ten minute walk to the Temple Bar area. The Epic Ireland exhibit was right next door to the hotel and the replica ship, Jeanie Johnson, was docked in front of the hotel. ",4,2016,09,11
228,"No A/C, no problem!","As Floridians we were a little concerned with all the reviews that the hotel did not have A/C. We live our life by the “aircon” and to think about staying in a hotel that didn’t have it was more than concerning!

…I am so glad we didn’t worry! Once we checked in we were immediately re-assured as soon as we swiped our card to open the door that the room we had, although the outside temp averaged in the high 60s, never felt hot or even warm. There was a great breeze that cooled our 6th floor room facing the Liffey. We loved keeping the window open at night and hearing the sounds of the city. At one point it even got too cold and we had to shut the window.

This hotel was in a great location to where we could easily get to the Dublin Bus system (Airlink right out front to easily get to and from the airport), the red Luas line, and a quick walk to the Temple Bar. Due to this we wore out our 3 day Leap visitor card.

Also, although the hotel is a recent Hilton conversion and I was skeptical, every aspect of our stay exemplified the Hilton brand. I am a bit of Hilton snob as I spend the majority of my professional life in their hotels and this hotel did not disappoint! From check-in, to breakfast, the hotel recognized my Hhonors loyalty to the T! I could list many veteran Hhonors Hotels in the US who miss simple things, yet this hotel hit each and every benefit.

So that being said I guess we have to talk about the cons. The only one I have is the fridge in the room is not very cold. We bought a couple bottles of water at the local Tesco and they were just luke-warm after sitting overnight in the fridge. So that’s it, the worst of my problems is with cold water…",5,2016,09,10
228,Nice other than rooms were too hot due to no a/c,"I stayed at the hotel for one night whilst in Dublin on a business trip.  The hotel is very conveniently located in central Dublin.  I had a room on the fifth floor which was very well appointed other than for the fact that there was no air conditioning do the room was rather hot, although the hotel did supply a fan so at least I could get the air to circulate a bit.  Breakfast was a buffet with a good selection of hot food, but sadly no salmon or other fish.  If there was air conditioning I would stay there next time I am in Dublin, but as there is not I will look elsewhere.",3,2016,09,10
228,Dublin Trip,"Very nice hotel, great breakfast, very gd location rooms hot, service was very good great views of river make sure you get river view but noisy street bridge right next to hotel esy walking distance to Trinity and Temple Bar Very nice hotel",4,2016,09,10
228,Perfect!,"Loved this spot! Location was ideal, breakfast was INCREDIBLE, staff was so helpful! We dropped off our rental car at Hertz City Centre and then walked back to the hotel, past all the sights, along the River..great restaurant around the corner (Ely Bar & Brasserie), and the train station is not even a 5min walk. The beds are so comfy; the shower is wonderful; it was warm, but there's a fan so who cares.

Highly recommend!",4,2016,09,10
228,Perfect hotel right in city centre,"We had a wonderful nights stay at the Hilton Garden Inn, located right on the River Liffey.

Pros:
- best breakfast so far!!!
- clean modern accommodations 
- free wifi that actually works
- location, location, location
- walking distance from train station 

Semi Cons:
- parking is a bit inconvenient when navigating heavy luggage however the hotel provides a 50% discount

- the coffee at breakfast was from an automated machine instead of a fresh cup that tasted bitter ... Luckily there are a ton of coffee shops right next door

In summary:
I would 100% stay here exclusively if ever visiting Dublin again - highly highly recommend !!!",5,2016,09,10
228,Very comfortable hotel,The hotel seems to have been updated not too long ago.  The breakfast had a very nice spread.  It was a great place to do a quick load of laundry on our 2 week trip.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.,4,2016,09,10
228,"Good, though beware lack of a/c","This property was formerly Jury's but became a Hilton in June 2016. The whole property has been nicely refurbished and is very clean and comfortable. We were upgraded to a king double on the front, south facing and overlooking the Liffey river, which was kind of nice. However it was unusually hot for Dublin during our stay and we noticed the lack of any temperature control in the room. They provide a desk fan, which helped, but having the window open all night was not really an option due to the quite heavy traffic along the quay to and from the docks. The hotel is a 20-minute walk to the city centre, but there is a tram stop just behind it that will take you to O'Connell St. Also the airport bus stops right outside (coming from the airport it sets down on the other side of the road, about 200m away. Staff were very good. The first night we ate in Olly's, the hotel restaurant, which was OK, but nothing specialand a bit burger-orientated.",4,2016,09,09
228,Good for a business trip,"Good hotel this, clean tidy perfect for business. In the heart of the commercial centre but not far away from the main bars and restaurants of the city centre.

There on a one night business trip couldn't fault it, decent buffet breakfast great choice.

Unfortunately Dublin gets more and more expensive everytime I visit.",4,2016,09,09
228,expensive but good location.,"Expensive for a fairly basic room and facing onto the traffic. As the room was warm, it was disappointing that there was no airconditioning and could not leave the window open due to the traffic noise. Although a fan was provided this was not adequate as it did not reduce the temperature compromised a good nights sleep. Good transport links very close to the hotel. Overall a disappointing nights stay due to this",3,2016,09,08
228,Dublin trip,Lovely night in Dublin staying at the holiday inn ex Jutys where we have stayed before which was excellent then but even better now we will be definitely be returning and will be highly recommending you to our friends,5,2016,09,07
228,4 days city break,"The hotel is a little off centre, but only short walks to moist of the tourist attractions. We were early arriving at the hotel 0900 hours, but our room was available which was nice. We did not have any air conditioning in the room, a fan was supplied which was sufficient. Cannot fault the staff of the breakfast.. However, my wife is a vegetarian, and there were NO main meals at the  hotel. Later we did find out that they woulod do a pizza.",5,2016,09,06
228,Very expensive and no air conditioning,"The hotel was clean and newly renovated in a convenient location.  However on a weekend that was not particularly hot, the room was very hot and had no air conditioning.  We could only open the window a sliver. The breakfast was expensive at 13 Euros and not included in the room. All in all I would look for a better value in Dublin.",3,2016,09,06
228,Split Group - Very disappointed,"Having booked 7 rooms for 3 nights at this hotel, 5 months in advance, I was very disappointed when we arrived at around 10pm to be told that 3 of the rooms had been given to another larger group and some of our group would have to travel to another hotel for the first night. We were given a free breakfast the first night, a taxi between the hotels and 6 free drinks between 10 of us. The hotel had double booked the rooms and we had to split our group which ruined the start of our trip. The staff were very friendly but we felt that being moved to another hotel was unacceptable.",2,2016,09,06
228,Never again. ,"First thing I want to say is the staff was awesome! Met some really great people and they did all they could do to make the 7 days manageable. 
With that said will never stay there again! For what you get its way too expensive. The room was so hot had to request another fan and leave the window open the entire time. The menu is very limited to European folks and not worth the money. The shower leaked and the room is really small. Had to walk .5 mile to eat or drink anything worth while and every time we got a cab, almost got killed. The cabs have to make a U turn in front of hotel or go .5 mile out of the way to get downtown. 

Thanks to the staff! Hope things get better. 

Pics are view from the room. ",2,2016,09,05
228,If you have no other choice,First of all I am not a big fan of this chain of hotels where you feel a number and not a guest. Anyway I had not many options as my favorite hotel was fully booked so I opted this one based on rating. First of all the rooms are small but clean. There is no A/C so at night it was so hot I couldnt sleep properly. They put a small fan but it didnt really work. I wanted to order something from the menu in my room and I called room service. It was 10PM and they said they serve only pizzas at this time... i just wanted a tea and dessert... after 5 min on the phone they said they couldnt. I went downstairs in the restaurant to order the same and they told me they could deliver to me... not sure if all this makes sense. Irish ppl are so nice and will always make everything to please you I have to say. Anyway on the second day I came back to my room after long day of meetings and the room was left with my rubbish from previous day... the breakfast buffet is so basic with poor quality products I prefered to skip it on second day. City center from hotel about 10/15 min walk.,2,2016,09,04
228,Very good value for Dublin,"Hotels in Dublin are often pricey, so I tried this as an alternative to others I'd stayed at in the area previously.

Given it was a short business trip (2 nights) I didn't make use of many of the facilities, so can't comment on the small gym or breakfast. The bar was just OK (Dublin prices!) with a small drinks selection, so I used the Spencer's bar up the road where I'd stayed before.

Decent WiFi, free business centre, even a guest laundry means you have all you need on site, plus nearby coffee shops if you don't want to pay the breakfast supplement.

The room was comfortable, plenty of space and storage. Lack of air con didn't bother me, instead I shifted the large fan to the floor to give more desk space. Room was lacking a bit of light, sadly.

Only area I'd say needs improvement is housekeeping training. One bottle of shower gel is a bit stingy especially when there is an on-site gym, but it wasn't even replenished on day 2 so I had to call reception, who sent another (1) bottle. I worked from the room before a late checkout and had the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, but this didn't stop staff knocking repeatedly and trying to enter even before noon. How hard is it to understand ""do not disturb?!""

Overall a surprisingly good hotel in terms of facilities and value for the location, and I would be happy to stay again and recommend it.",4,2016,09,04
228,New Year Trip,"Was here for New Year 2016 and a surprise trip for my husband's 50th birthday. Hotel was Jurys Inn at that time.

Lovely hotel, great position, quiet at night (away from the Temple Bar area) and excellent facilities.

Would definitely book again :)",5,2016,09,01
228,Lovely base for exploring,"Parking is nearby in a public car park about 2 minutes walk away.  The hotel is on the waterfront and a highly visible landmark when walking along the river.  There is a bus stop just outside for one of the city bus tours and it is easy to walk to the Grand canal (15 minutes) or trinity College (20 minutes).  It is lovely to walk up and down the riverfront here, it is well lit and seems safe and quiet.
Inside, the hotel has good wifi and is very quiet, even with a German coach party singing ""Molly Malone"" in the bar :P We watched sunset from the ferry before departing for an early morning arrival in Pembroke.
The room was a good size, had modern decor and plenty of work and storage space as well as sufficient plug sockets.  The beds were great and very comfortable.  There is  a good gym downstairs with a mix of machines and is open 24 hours a day. Staff were all helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was particularly good with a nice mix of options.",5,2016,09,01
228,"Delightful, fantastic value, super clean, attentive service all around!!","We booked the Hilton Garden Inn when we were frantically checking out early from a B&B which turned out to be a terrible disappointment and disaster!!!  As we were considering our potential,options we thought the Hilton would be a good choice since my previous stays at a Hilton have been consistently good service and cleanliness.
From the moment we checked in we felt much more relaxed and were assured by the staff who helped us.  Our room was clean,,comfortable,,and convenient!! Hilton Garden Inn is right on the Liffey River, near most of Dublin's main attractions.  Can't say enough about the desk staff gentleman ( Mark) who helped us with directions,,suggestions, and had a wonderful sense of humor.  Those 2 days spent at the Hilton most certainly were a great choice!!! We would highly recommend the Hilton Garden Inn when staying in Dublin.  We did not want to risk another accommodations disaster and the Hilton is known for consistent service, cleanliness, and location!!",5,2016,08,31
228,"Great location, really friendly staff","Quick stay overnight in Dublin. Staff were extremely polite and friendly,from reception to cleaners and made us feel welcome from start to end. Room was modern clean and comfortable and location is great: just a 10 minute walk to O'Connell St, 15 to Grafton St with all transport easily accessible close by and plenty of restaurants/cafes in area. Well exceeds the standard of similarly priced hotels in Dublin. Will stay there again when next in Dublin.",5,2016,08,30
228,Very well located,Everything about the hotel was great!! Except for the fact that it didn't have air conditioning . It was very hot when we were there. The service and cleanliness were wonderful. All the staff were polite and friendly. The location made getting around very easy and we were close to all the things we wanted to see,4,2016,08,29
228,Nice hotel and good location,"My partner and I stayed for 1 night for Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House Hotel. You are located about 10 minutes walk to the main shopping areas (O’Connell St) and 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar. There is also a hop off/on bus stop right outside the hotel.

After walking all day, we tried to have a drink at the bar before heading up to the room, however were left disappointed after trying to enjoy a red wine, but they didn’t stock Merlot and were out of stock of Cabernet Sauvignon. I then tried to have a beer and that was not available. We finally got a beer and white wine and quench our thirst.

The room was very modern, spacious and comfortable although a little warm and the front desk staff very helpful and full of suggestions of sites to see. We didn't try the breakfast as there are so many places to try locally.",4,2016,08,28
228,Really nice place to stay,"We stayed here as we were attending a conference at the concention centre which was a few min walk away. Our room was lovely and clean, serviced daily and friendly staff. Lovely breakfast with a large choice of food. Highly recommended. Bus stop right out the front or a 10-15 min walk  to main shopping streets. ",4,2016,08,28
228,Excellent stay ,"We stayed in a twin room, it was immaculately clean with modern decor. Staff were really on the ball and courteous. Very handy for visiting 3arena. About a 15 minute walk from Temple Bar, 10 mins walk from Connolly station. Didn't eat in the hotel in the end but the menus looked decent with a range of veggie options too.",5,2016,08,27
228,Ok,"My stay wAs as expected, I stayed there before, the bedrooms are very clean, sheets and towels are fresh. The staff in all areas are friendly but overall I think the hotel lacks an atmosphere  - no ambiance ",3,2016,08,26
228,Typically Satisfying,"I don't usually leave reviews and often do find something negative but, Hilton hotels typically ail to let me down which is why I am a Hilton honours member. Clean rooms, very comfortab beds and linens, all decor was modern and good wifi and television. Food is always very good. Thin walls is common in any hotel so that's' not specific to this hotel sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you are not, overall 9/10",5,2016,08,26
228,Very clean and comfortable hotel in a great location from which to explore Dublin,"We stayed for 2 nights on a short city break.  I was there with my two teenage daughters and this hotel was a great choice.  The room we were allocated was spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  The beds were also very comfortable with great quality bedding.  The staff were very helpful with directions when asked for assistance.  The location is great, it is about a 10 minute walk from O' Connell Street and a perfect base to explore Dublin from.  The free wi-fi was very good and certainly kept the kids happy.",5,2016,08,25
228,Very Comfortable Hotel in Excellent location,"Within short level walking distance of the city centre and of buses, trams and trains (the airport bus stops outside),this hotel is a good choice for both tourists and business people.The hotel is comfortable and well-appointed, and has a pleasant bar and good restaurant. A problem for some guests might be the lack of air-conditioning and the need to leave windows open at night, with the risk of traffic noise.",4,2016,08,24
228,Great hotel,"This hotel is beautiful,  we paid for the buffet breakfast to which was well worth it. There's a busy road in front of hotel but when windows are closed you can't hear anything. Couldn't say there was anything we were unhappy with , would definitely recommend an go back again ",5,2016,08,24
228,"Great location, great vibe","The Hilton Garden Hotel is in a great location, the staff are very friendly and the hotel has a really nice vibe, particularly in the lobby, cafe and Olly's bar areas.  One thing which needs sorting out is the terrible water pressure of the shower.  Other than that I would highly recommend the hotel.",4,2016,08,24
228,I miss the bed,This hotel is situated so close to the city centre we didn't know ourselves when we got there. Staff are friendly and helpful. I loved the bed though. So comfy. Also the sound proof glass on the windows were amazing.,5,2016,08,24
228,"Smart, Central, Comfortable, Great Breakfast Buffet","I was in Dublin for a couple of nights on business. This Hotel was just perfect. Ideally located just a short walk from Connolly Rail and Bus Station. A 10 minute walk to the main shopping areas and 15 minutes walk to Temple Bar. The room was very modern, spacious and comfortable. I couldn't fault it. It had everything. The breakfast buffet in the morning was well presented and very tasty. I didn't spend any time at the bar but it looked fine for a few pre or post dinner drinks. The staff I encountered were all friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2016,08,23
228,Very clean and comfortable,"This hotel was part of a City Break deal. On the banks of the Liffey, this hotel was clean & comfortable. No AC so a bit stuffy at night. We had a river view room and didn't find it too noisy for sleeping - even with the window open. The airport bus 747 stops outside the hotel. So, with the 72 hrs Freedom Pass, it was a breeze getting to & from the airport.

Breakfast was very nice with lots to choose from. The staff were very helpful.

A 5 min walk to O'Connell Street takes you to the Purple Route  Hop On Hop Off bus which, in turn, takes you to Temple Bar area.

4 stars from me. It would have been 5 but no AC.",4,2016,08,23
228,Best Hotel if you want to go around Dublin,Location was very convenient for people working near IFSC and people who want to explore Dublin can benefit from the convenience of nearby bus/luas/dart station. It is situated near the River liffey which is good fOr an afternoon stroll. Facilities of the hotel is the same for most hotel chain although I commend how helpful the staff are.,4,2016,08,23
228,Nice hotel,Every time we travel to Dublin we stay there the rooms are very clean the bed and very comfortable great views of the river great food nice bar staff very helpful the hotel is very near the city center ,5,2016,08,23
228,Business trip,"Really good location for all attractions overlooking the river. Staff were very welcoming and looked after us. Must try the breakfast with plenty of options and very tasty. Overall, a very nice experience",4,2016,08,22
228,Love the new look hotel,"I value honest feedback that helps hotels ensure the quality of service they promote. The Hilton Garden , in my view, scores a ten out of ten. It was excellent, so much so all I could pick to improve is provide a shower cap and the room was a bit too warm! The comfort, location, & staff are super!",5,2016,08,22
228,Great stay,"Situated on the River Liffey in the old harbor district. Pedestrian bridge crosses the river in front of the hotel, and George's Dock light rail station (red line) is just outside the rear entrance providing good access to all major attractions and hot spots. White collar area by day. Quiet at night. Streets  were never empty and I felt safe walking the area late at night. 
Stayed two nights in a 5th floor king room with river view. Woke up to the sounds of the city waking. Room was clean and comfortable. Plenty of storage and counter space. Fans supplied in place of a/c (typical in Ireland). Windows open and room temperature was never too warm. 
Front desk staff is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and polite. I stay in hotels 60 - 365 days a year and this is the best staff I have encountered. A large lobby with plenty of space to relax and regroup for your next excursion. 
I didn't try the restaurant although it was popular at breakfast and dinner times.
This is the old Jurrys Inn (still identified as such in several map apps) and although Hiltons website says there is construction, I did not see any. The place looks new inside. ",5,2016,08,20
228,Refreshing First Visit,"I know this hotel for many years staying a few times a year when it was part of the JURYS Inns group. Now under the Hilton brand the hotel has acquired a refreshing new ambiance. Well located with attentive staff, new bright rooms and a new menu, I will be looking forward to my next stay. ",5,2016,08,20
228,Disappointing but staff want to please,Facilities are generic chain hotel but room we were in (504) was too hot despite cool weather .  Fans to circulate hot air does not cool it down . Room next door was at least 5 degree cooler . Restaurant gluten free menu consisted of swapping out bread for gf bread. Few options and staff knew little about rules. Offering contaminated chips and questionable burger. Bar had one ale that had run out but about 7 lagers on tap. Chain hotel should do better than that at that price. ,3,2016,08,20
228,New hotel,Stayed here for the first time since change of brand. Rooms wouldn't be the most spacious but very clean and modern. Found the bed and pillows extremely comfortable. Fitness centre is just above average but the rest of the hotel and my experience was very good. Will stay again and recommend it to people,5,2016,08,19
228,Superb hotel near central Dublin,"Maybe it's because I had the misfortune to stay at a terrible hotel last week, so any decent standard of service would have impressed, but overall, I was genuinely delighted with this hotel. Recently refurbed (along with a brand change from Jury's to Hilton Garden Inn), this hotel had everything and more you expect from a quality, moderately priced hotel. 
It was just a one night stay and I didn't eat here but the room was well equipped and the bed was sumptuously comfy. All interactions with the staff from front desk, bar staff and housekeeping were professional, gracious and good humoured. 

There are good restaurant options within a 5 - 10 minute walk and the city centre is a 15 minute stroll. There is a car park close by that I made use of but only use if you don't need your car after 10pm - it closes overnight.
I will definitely stay here again on a future visit to Dublin. ",5,2016,08,19
228,"Great staff, good location","Our 4 day stay in Dublin got off to a great start thanks to the red haired Irish lass behind the desk at the Hilton Garden Inn Custom House.  She gave us some great tips on where to go, what to see and how to save money.  I had booked a view of the River Liffey in our online reservation and she set us up in a corner suite to boot.

The hotel is only a few blocks walk into the centre of town, 10 to 15 minute walk from the Temple Bar area and next to one of the two pedestrian bridges.

Our only regret was that the hotel did not have air conditioning and just one window that would open about 3 inches.",4,2016,08,18
228,Affordable lodging in Dublin,"The rooms are small, but then again, you don't spend much time in your room do you?  The aesthetic was very nice and fitting with the Hilton brand and the bathroom items are Peter Thomas Roth which was real plus!

The only issue that I had with the hotel was that our room faced street side and although the hotel is considered to be in the financial district, there was a ton of loud noise outside which kept us up throughout the night.  It sounded like partiers up and down the street.  Not sure if there is a pub nearby, but I was surprised that I could hear the noise through the closed window.

Overall, I would stay here again.",4,2016,08,18
228,Amazing hotel and the staff we're friendly,Amazing  hotel I'd highly recommend it to anyone the staff were friendly and helpful couldn't ask for anymore the breakfast had everything you would need and it was no problem to get anything if they had run out ,5,2016,08,17
228,Good first impression,"Visited recently and my first impressions are good with just some teething problems to sort out.

The room overlooked the river and, as per previous posts, the lack of AC makes it a slightly sweaty experience.  They apologised for it on arrival and the fan in the room does help, a little.  Apart from that the room was comfortable and clean, and the bathroom was up to standard.

Breakfast was just delightful!  Such a great spread with lots of different options and all very tasty and fresh.  Its a self-select table arrangement which doesn't' really work as we had to inspect 3 before we found 1 with the proper set of cutlery/crockery and was clean.  Even at that some of the cutlery could have done with a proper wash.

And as a HH member there was no water in the room but it was delivered once I pointed this out.

Overall, great location and this place is off to a good start!",4,2016,08,17
228,Wedding  Anniversary,"We stayed here for a couple of nights,we found  the reception  staff very helpful  and friendly. Our room was wonderful overlooking  the Liffey.When we arrived  we asked for any recommendations  for our anniversary  meal which they gave us a few and marked  them on a map.When we got up to our room when it was ready as we had arrived  after an early flight  there was a card and chocolates  for us. The hotel was lovely  comfy and clean. The  breakfast was great  with plenty of choice.For me it made our stay an anniversary  to remember. Thanks ",5,2016,08,17
228,Don't visit during summer,"I spent three nights at this hotel, and I don't think I'll be coming back. 
I chose this hotel because it was very close to the 3 Arena where I was attending a show and because it was a Hilton Garden Inn. 

The hotel does not have air condition! This was one of the weeks during the summer where Dublin saw 20 degrees which means the 5th floor of the hotel felt more like a humid sauna than a hotel room. A desk fan was provided in each room, but it did little to improve the situation. We were forced to sleep with the window open. 
This would have been fine had it not been for a very loud woman engaging in reproductive activities at 3am one of the nights. This type of behaviour you can't really blame the hotel for, but because of the heat, the window had to be left open.

The check in lady did not provide any information about the breakfast times during check in and I forgot to ask. I would have appreciated if she would have let us know the times, and he fact that it gets crazy busy between 8 and 9. There was no seats for us about 8:30, so we had to stand there with our breakfast plates desperately looking for someone to leave their spot. Not, very comfortable and although I expected busy, nothing had prepared me for this chaos.

Why does the doors have to SLAM when they close? If you're sleeping in, or like to go to bed early, you'll probably be woken up by the neighbouring rooms when they enter/leave their room. 

The housekeeping, when they had visited were great, but you'd expect them to show up sometime between the crazy busy breakfast and 5pm, but they had not. Same story the next day... 

What other Hilton brand hotels lack AC? This hotel does not meet the Hilton Garden Inn Standard I was expecting and I've now learned the hard way to always call the hotels first, even Hilton's, to get this confirmed.

Couple of tips when visiting this hotel: 
1. Book a room off the street, the neighbouring road is very busy and noisy so you'll have a hard time sleeping with your window open. 

2. Get a room at the end of the hallway. You'll have less doors near you that SLAM.

3. Sleep in, no need to worry if housekeeping would like to clean your room. They won't get to you until around dinner time.

4. Arrive early for breakfast. You don't want to stand their like an idiot with your plate in the hand looking for a seat.  

Good things:
Beds were comfy, internet worked without any hassle and lobby area and business centre were nice. The staff were kind and sympathetic to the heat, but as they cant control the weather or magically make the hotel air Conditioned there was not much they could do. ",2,2016,08,16
228,Great hotel with easy access to Centre ,"Stayed for 2 nights with my friend on a mini break to Dublin. Fantastic hotel within a 10 minute walk to Temple Bar area. Rooms were very spacious, clean and equipped with tea making facilities, iron and board, hairdryer and TV. Bus stops right outside the hotel so very easy to get around. Would defiantly recommend. ",5,2016,08,15
228,Best value Hotel I have stayed in Dublin,Had not stated here before but would definitely stay again. A very well located hotel great rooms and self service breakfast.  Staff very helpful. The hotel has all mod cons and great wifi overall I found it great value for central Dublin. ,5,2016,08,14
228,Great overnight stay ," Couldn't fault this hotel, great location, lovely rooms and staff! We stayed for the close proximity to the Bord Gais Theatre, but it's also a short walk to Connolly Station and O'Connell Street. Will definitely stay again in our next trip to Dublin!

Thank you! ",5,2016,08,13
228,Lovely hotel,"Beds were very comfortable,we had a room for 3 adults and the room was very roomy,very clean, and the room maids were extremely helpful and polite. Room was a little on the warm side and the shower was a little weak but there was a bath which was nice",4,2016,08,11
228,Mean,Sad to see this mean type of hotel in Dublin Ireland Coach Driver collecting 43 Persons refused a cup of tea during delay. #RSA So much for Irish hospitality and Road Safety. It's becoming dangerous due to lack of parking and foreign coaches and hotel owners allow break Irish laws.,1,2016,08,11
228,Great experience,"Very conveniently located, good value, clean and comfortable room. The hotel was very clean as well and the service is really good. The staff are friendly and helpful. This hotel was only a few blocks from the convention and short walk to the city center.",5,2016,08,10
228,No aircon in the rooms,"We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights with my partner and family members. The hotel is a bit of a walk from the centre, but fairly close to everything. The facilities are ok e.g. the gym. Our room was quite small and really warm and stuffy. There is no aircon in the rooms and even though the outdoor temperature was only 17 degrees, the room somehow was too warm. We tried to keep the window open but it didn't  really help and the street is really noisy so interferes with sleep. They have a fan in the rooms but it doesn't seem to make much difference. For this reason I would not stay in the hotel again.",3,2016,08,09
228,The rooms overheat,We stayed for 2 uncomfortable nights at this hotel and had two rooms for a group of four. The rooms are not air conditioned and the Window openings are restricted to a very small opening making it difficult to cool or ventilate the room. With the window open there is a lot of noise from the busy road along the quay. We asked reception if anything could be done about the heat but they could only offer us a portable fan. I would not recommend staying in this hotel. ,2,2016,08,09
228,Lovely stay!,"Visited Dublin in June with my two friends who were over from America. Hotel is lovely, well presented and modern. It is situated right on the river so you get nice views depending on the room you get given. It's situated about 10 minutes walk from all the bars. Would recommend this to anyone, business or leisure!",5,2016,08,08
228,Overnight stop pre-ferry,"We stopped in Dublin after relaxing and eventful holiday in Sligo before getting the early morning Ferry home. We occupied two rooms at the end of the corridor and both were excellent, clean and well decorated. Bathroom/shower room were sparkling. Large TV and internet used by us all before comfortable nights sleep. Sadly no time for Breakfast. Used car park behind hotel at reasonable cost for Dublin. Would definitely stay here again for position and comfort.",4,2016,08,08
228,Great hotel in Dublin Custom House area for business or leisure,"I stayed 2 nights at the Hilton Gardon Inn Dublin Custom House Hotel (it was then called Jurys Inn, about to be rebranded to the Hilton) for business. It was a very good experience - in terms of facilities, friendliness of the staff, food and location. You are close to everything important in Dublin, whether visiting on business or pleasure. The breakfast buffet was great, and the restaurant serves tasty a la carte food. A well maintained property, this hotel is good value for money at the Custom House area.",4,2016,08,07
228,Beautiful hotel with a great location!,"Had a wonderful 4 night stay, the hotel is lovely and location is great.  Everything was super clean and modern.  The staff are very helpful. The only negative to our stay was the room was too warm.  No air conditioning yet, but Hilton will be installing by the end of 2017.   We would definitely stay here again, even without the AC.  ",5,2016,08,07
228,1ST CLASS STAY,"Had 3 rooms booked this week & the hotel is spotless as is the rooms

The staff are so helpful even though we had a slight problem with a over charge.

The rooms (320) was quite big with 2 double beds & bath shower ,large tv
and plenty of wardrobe space

Teat / facilities as well

The breakfast staff a chef's were very good as was the huge selection

Could not get in next week so we are off to The Spencer next door",5,2016,08,06
228,"Great location, surprisingly quiet!","This hotel is a 15 minute walk or 15 minute cab ride to pretty much everything I wanted to do in Dublin. Although my room faced the street, it was surprisingly quiet - the extra inner window made a great sound barrier. I highly recommend this location!",5,2016,08,05
228,Love this hotel,"Stayed here while attending a show at the bird gains energy theatre. Had problems with our booking as the agency we booked through had not informed the hotel of our arrival. Hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating, sorted the problem out very quickly. Rooms were spotless, breakfast was the best I've had . Can't recommend highly enough. Keep up the good work.",5,2016,08,05
228,Excellent stay,Stayed recently for my birthday and found staff extremely friendly we didn't like the view from our room which staff were happy to change. Snacks a bit pricy and it's a hassle having to que at check in to pay for them but overall very nice stay and so close to the city ,5,2016,08,04
228,"Good location, only 10 minutes walk to Temple Bar area.",Hotel was nice. We arrived early for check in and asked if we could leave our cases but as they had a room ready we could check in right away. We had a room overlooking The Liffey. Room was spacious and beds were a good size and very comfortable. Only negative was no air conditioning. The three nights we stayed were very muggy and we had to leave window open and as it seems to be a main road there was a lot of traffic noise. Staff were curtious and always said hello. Buffet breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice to suit everyone. The hotel was only 10 minutes walk from the main area in Dublin. It was a bit pricey but seem to be inline with Dublin prices. Would definitely recommend it.,4,2016,08,04
228,Anniversary weekend,"A weekend away to celebrate our wedding anniversary, stayed Friday to Tuesday.  Original booking made with a Jury's but received email advising of rebrand.  Slight concern initially but need not have worried, an excellent hotel with staff who have been trained well in customer service.  Any queries dealt with efficiently and with a smile.
Room spotless, bed very comfortable.  Our room was at the front overlooking the river, and the road. Windows had very effective double glazing to reduce the noise from the road so we were able to have a very restful sleep.  Rooms do not have air conditioning, we were advised of this on arrival and given the option of a room at the rear but chose view over the river, fans were available if needed.
Within reasonable walk of City Centre, tram station at the rear of hotel.  Selection of eateries in area close to hotel but much more choice in the city.  Bus from airport  (747) has bus stop right outside the hotel, return ticket only 10 euros, runs every 10 mins.",4,2016,08,03
228,Not so great,"No A/C and they have problems with the fire alarm going off all the time. I would skip this hotel all together, Also don't try to get on the AirlInk 747, always runs full, since is the last stop before heading to the Airport.",3,2016,08,03
228,Great location and facilities but rooms do need air conditioning  ,"We stayed here for a couple of nights and the hotel is located in a terrific location.
You can walk everywhere in Dublin easily including the Temple Bar area.
Beds were comfy and the room had everything but air conditioning  which was a problem with the warm weather we had in Dublin. The windows did open but did not help cool the room and the traffic noise outside with the window open made it difficult to sleep.
Hopefully now as a Hilton hotel the aircon problem may be addressed.
Staff were great and the lobby bar was a great place to chill with friends.",4,2016,08,01
228,great,"handy location for work and for centre of town. Food was excellent - good breakfast buffet and evening meals . clean room, comfy bed, helpful staff. The room was quite warm but a fan was provided. You should be aware that the hotel was recently taken over from Jurys as some of the taxi drivers were not aware of this. Staff were friendly and efficient",5,2016,07,31
228,Great time,"lovely food, excellent breakfast buffet and my favourite evening meals ( steak, seafood chowder and caser salads) . Room was great - comfy bed, all the required amenities, clean, efficient. couldn't complain about anything. The staff were extremely helpful. The hotel was conveniently situated for my training course and also for the centre of town",5,2016,07,31
228,Great Location friendly staff,"Stayed here for a concert in June, ideal location just a shirt walk from the 3Arena, staff were very friendly and accommodating, would definitely recommend to anybody wanting to stay close to the City. A little pricey but hey, that's Dublin nowadays.",4,2016,07,29
228,Not mid-town but very close,"Booking the Garden Inn was a matter of convenience. It's not located in the ""noise"" of the city but everything popular is within walking distance.
We had a family type room with 2 queens. It's a very spacious room but does not include an aircon. I suppose most rooms do not have one. Looking at Ireland's climate it's probably not needed and you get a fan but we considered the room to be rather warm and opening the window a tad did not change much.
The bathroom is large enough but does not include a loo brush.
Breakfast is Irish and continental. Cereals are of the sugar enriched type from a certain brand :( B&Bs do better).
As with any larger hotel, in order to avoid the big rush, try to show up somewhat later if you can.
They have a short-cut access to the nearby covered public car park which you access from the side with your car.",4,2016,07,29
228,"Comfortable, central and very reasonable","Booked this via Expedia as Jury's Hotel but by the time we arrived, it had turned into the Hilton Garden Inn. It was on offer at an exceptionally good price £32 per night - I guess it was an introductory offer. Overlooking the LIffey, walking distance to the city centre and on the bus route to the airport. Smart public rooms, good, hearty breakfast and clean, comfortable rooms with - thank the Lord - fluffy pillows, soft towels, windows that actually open and a hairdryer not glued to the bathroom wall.  I suspect it will never be as cheap again, but a very good find on this occasion.",4,2016,07,28
228,Good location,"Wasn't quite sure what to expect, as Hilton had just recently taken over the property from Jury's, but was pleasantly surprised. Staff was great, the hotel restaurant was better than expected, and we were a short stumble from Temple Bar.",4,2016,07,26
228,Great location,"Situated amongst it all, you are never too far from the hustle and bustle of Dublin.
Lovely room, décor was modern and sleek, staff were delightful and helpful.
The one problem i had was the parking, on the hotel website they said they had parking, when i arrived i was informed it was a private car park and not the hotels and there is a day charge, which I didn't mind paying, i just would have rather been informed prior to my visit, as I did not budget the day parking into my spending money. Other than that would highly recommended this hotel..",4,2016,07,26
228,Everything good except the heat! ,"To cut a long story short, the rooms so not have air conditioning and even though it wasn't exactly hot during my visit (20oC), I was on the 5th floor and it was like a sauna in my room! Very difficult to sleep at night and the only thing they had was a fan. Everything else was exactly as expected from a Hilton, except for the none air conditioned rooms. ",3,2016,07,25
228,Trip North,"The hotel is in a nice location, easy access to tour buses and the bus from the airport dropped me off on the corner.  Very friendly staff, enjoyed the buffet breakfast (14 euros ) ate one night dinner in the dining area which is off of the bar, drinks at the bar was lovely as they have a lot of beers on tap.  Room was very clean and comfortable. No air conditioning in the building (it is Ireland after all). The first day was quite warm and they had a fan in the room for me and I opened the windows.  Ask for a higher floor and face the back if you do not like street noise ( my room was on the first floor facing the street) Front desk staff very accommodating with suggestions of sites and booking a taxi for my early morning departure to the airport. Overall a nice stay.",4,2016,07,25
228,Excellent,Stayed here with our 9 yr old sone. Hotel was really nice and the breakfast was buffet style was a really good selection and always fresh. The vending machines were really handy for our son to get some late snacks.,4,2016,07,25
228,Many positives...   Great location for Airlink Bus pick up and near by drop off for Airport and Hop-On/Hop Off,"Enjoyed the river view of the hotel.  Even though the hotel is on a busy street, it has double windows which greatly reduces the noise from the road to virtually nothing...as in being quiet and holding your breath with no other noise on in the room or hallway.  Note:  no A/C in the rooms, which was common in a lot places we visited.   They have  fans and we asked for a second one to help keep us cool.   Stayed in the hotel for week and felt it was a decent value.  Great breakfast available.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Only a 10 minute walk away from Temple Bar area and Trinity University.  Would stay there again.      ",5,2016,07,25
228,Dublin Holiday,Great location and very friendly and helpful staff.  Rooms were clean and Breakfast was very good.  Bus stops outside hotel that takes you to the airport along with Stops for the Hop on Hop off Bus to tour the city.,4,2016,07,25
228,"Good location,staff helpful","Good position with short walk to everything.nice rooms, but with no air-con and only a fan it was not good at night,walls were a little thin as I could hear the person in the next room snoring. Staff very helpful.",4,2016,07,24
228,It will get five stars when they have an AC in the room!! ,"This hotel is supposed to get FIVE stars but I deducted one star because of NO AC...

Checked in on 7/21 and stayed here for three nights, I enjoyed the hotel very much. The only thing surprising and upsetting is no AC in the room. I mean every room is not equipped with AC. Thus, the room is very stuffy and hot the moment I walked in.  The Window only can open a little bit and small fans only can help a little bit. For Hilton series hotels, I was like ""you must be kidding me"" and immediately reflected the problem to Hilton. I was mad that Hilton didn't disclose this information on the Hilton.com otherwise, I will try to stay in somewhere else. 

The Hilton staff and manager did their best to accommodate me. I really appreciated all your efforts and they really care about your needs, especially the short lady who checked me in and the manager, Patrick. You guys are great!!

The hotel is very nice, bright, clean and morgen.  Internet is fast and works well. Breakfast is good . 

Will I come back to this hotel? My answer will be YES ( but only in the winter or they have AC in each room)

228,A must stay if you're in Dublin!,An overnight stay in Dublin saw us book this brilliant hotel. Easily the best value hotel we've stayed in on our 3 week European honeymoon. The service here is perfect. The food is great. The room is well presented. The bed was very comfy with quality linen and beautiful pillows. An excellent quality Samsung flat screen tv topped it off. Impeccably clean room and bathroom. Upon mentioning it was our honeymoon we were secretly left with a chilled bottle of wine with some lovely chocolates in our room while we made ourselves comfortable in their bar. Wonderful touch and it really topped off our great experience here. The buffet breakfast is probably the best we've had too. Huge range of quality food with eggs made to order if you wish. We wish we were staying for a further night or two. Thanks for enhancing our trip to Dublin! ,5,2016,07,24
228,Ok for a short stay,"We did 2 nights bed only The room was clean, bed realy compfortable .Tea coffee kettle tray.good choice of toiletries .tv.ironing board .no hairdryer . Quiet for a good nights sleep,staff helpful and friendly .no air con just a fan in the room 
A well equipt gym there's a coffee shop and resturant",4,2016,07,24
228,room with a view,"We stayed here for one night. Room with a 'view' looking over the River Liffey. This is a new hotel rebranded from Jurys. The hotel is so spacious on the ground floor. Staff very helpful and friendly. Rooms have an electronic key pad for entrance to your room and also for use in the lifts. We had a lunch here which was very good. Also breakfast was great. So much choice. We stayed in HGI in Aberdeen recently and this hotel would put their breakfast to shame. The hotel is so handy to transport links and also to shopping. Only problem is no AC and we stayed on the hottest night of the year. Needless to say I didn't get much sleep. A fan is provided but does not cool the room down. If you open window then you have traffic noise. I was told at reception they are hoping to expand next year and propose to do the air-conditioning then. Plenty of shops/restaurants on the streets at the back of the hotel including a M&S food store. Also serve Costa Coffee if you like this brand.

I would recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,24
228,Respect,"""Respect"" is an odd tittle for a hotel review, but you'll see why shortly. I stayed here for three nights in July 2016. Let's get the big problem out in the open:

 ==> This Hilton Property is NOT Air Conditioned <==

When I travel and use a brand with three star hotels I always check to see if a property has air conditioning. But when I stay in a US brand - Hilton or Marriott - I never check because they simply do; this one simply does not. Dublin gets hot at times in the summer, and hotel rooms get very hot and stuffy. Add to that the property is on a relatively main road - so opening the windows inundates you with noise and insects. This was a huge disappointment. Now the respect part - I contacted Hilton Honors about the issue, who contacted the management team, and they honored the Satisfaction Guaranteed or You Don't Pay guarantee. I greatly respect a brand that honors it's promise.

This is a refurbished Jury Inn and I'm not sure it's truly up to Hilton standards. Further this is not an inexpensive hotel; I'm not sure it's a good value at all.
WiFi: Good but not great and there is no enhanced high speed option. 
Location: OK but you're a 15 minute walk from the City Centre in a city that isn't that big. 
Housekeeping:Poor. The first day I was there housekeeping dropped a dirty wash rag on the floor and never picked it up for the next two days. They never vacuumed under the desk (if they vacuumed at all) and they removed dirty towels but never replaced them.
Staff: Excellent and sympathetic. I was not the first to complain about the lack of air conditioning.

I was speaking by chance to a woman who worked for Hilton during a city tour of Berlin, and she too agreed - you shouldn't have to check to see whether a Hilton property has air conditioning. Someone dropped the ball here big time. Would I stay here again - unlikely and definitely never during the summer months.",3,2016,07,22
228,"Good hotel, avoid the restaurant","Hilton Garden Inn is well located for City Centre and also Connolly Train Station (trains to Belfast).
Nice feel as you enter at reception and reception staff are pleasant. 
Rooms are well equipped with Tea making facilities and wifi. 
Overall a good hotel in a nice location.
Would avoid the restaurant for evening meal. I stayed for two nights. First night went to the restaurant and service was slow, staff here didn't seem interested. Second night went again and sat down,  after 10 minutes of no acknowledgement I asked for a menu, 5 minutes later and no sign of the menu I walked out. Disappointing in an otherwise good stay.",3,2016,07,21
228,Not a nice hotel,"Prices are expensive but thought we would go with the Hilton brand because I know, or thought i knew, that all Hilton hotels are good.  How wrong was I.   The location was great.  The staff were all very friendly and professional but what a dud of a hotel.  To start there is NO air-conditioning in the hotel AT ALL!!  It was a warm summers day and the room was boiling with a window that only open a few inches.  There was 1 fan in the room and we needed to ask for another one.  We had a family room that was a great size but as it was on the back side of the hotel and with windows open was loud due to deliveries.  There actually seems to be more noise coming from inside the hotel vs. outside.  Seems all of the doors slam shut but when they do they shake the walls...even doors 4-5 rooms down.  Our room 443 is terrible!!  The housekeeping closet is next door and when they start working at whatever time in the morning the door was slammed so hard it felt as if someone had slammed into the bed and woke us with a shock.  And happened over and over again.   A small detail...for a family room, only one tiny bottle of shampoo and one tiny bottle of shower gel is a bit stingy.  Also, the sink was slow to drain.   So breakfast, food good but service was terrible.  They do not reset the table.  You are made to seat yourself but there were never any clean tables.  They clear the plates but do not reset them.  So you go around picking napkins and cutlery from other tables.  Disgraceful!  There are no service lifts so staff need to use the customer lifts.  When trying to get down for breakfast we had to wait as the maid was using the lift.  Wifi was not that great either.  We ended up paying for faster connection.  So all in all our hotel stay was terrible.  As they say ""you can't polish a turd"".  Hilton you have failed your customers miserably with this one.",1,2016,07,21
228,no air conditioned in the room,"I had a a terrible night with no air condition and about 33 degrees in my room. I was there for 2 night and when I asked to change room in the morning after my first might, the receptionnist refused. FYI I am a silver member and I was there for business . I had to go to another hotel! ",2,2016,07,21
228,Great location and good refurbishment,"I syayed here on business and things couldn't have been better. Great views over the river, trains and trams a short walk away, and the staff just perfect. Restaurant menu fine for short stays but there are daily specials too.",5,2016,07,20
228,Sweaty and Small ,"The double was tiny, and due to the fact that there was no air conditioning my family and I were roasting in the sauna of a room, the window was only able to be opened a crack and the 13 inch fan did nothing but blow hot air around. Room service was unbelievably expensive and wasn't that great I might add. Although the service was friendly overall I'd have to say, the wifi worked well, and the room was clean. Personally I think the stay was way overpriced in the end. ",2,2016,07,19
228,"Average, not worth the extra money","While the location is convenient, the rooms are average and there is no air conditioning. This may not be a problem most months, but we visited in July and were shocked to find just a small electric fan oscillating in the room. Upon further discovery, no air conditioning. We broiled both nights. The room was clean, and the bathroom was nice though. Overall this hotel is very overpriced, and just average. ",3,2016,07,19
228,Hen Party Weekend,"I stayed here with friends as part of a Hen Party Weekend Friday - Sunday. We had a lovely room on the second floor with great views over The River Liffey. The Beds were comfortable, the room clean and the bathroom well equipped with toiletries, there were no shortages of towels or toilet roll, and tea and coffee supplies were also in the room.

Breakfast was a real treat with a vast selection of fruit, cereal yoghurt, breakfast pastries, continental cheese and hams and the fabulous Irish Breakfast. Eggs could be cooked anyway you liked at the ""Egg Station"" along with omelettes and Waffles, As much Nutella, Marshmallows' and syrup as you liked. All the food was fresh and hot.

Saturday evening we chose to dine at the hotel restaurant, Oly's. Being a group of 9 they reserved a lovely long table for us and had Prosecco waiting for us on arrival. We all chose from the set evening menu, 2 course for 24.95 Euro, very reasonable. The food was of a very high standard, hot, delicious and pleasing to the eye.

On the day of departure we had a few hours to kill between vacating the rooms and being picked up for the airport transfer, the staff were more than happy to store our luggage away for us so we didn't have to carry it around whilst we wandered through Dublin.

Another little extra was the internet, although free wifi is available to use throughout the hotel, the staff were kind enough to let us use the computer and print our boarding passes for the flight home at no extra cost.

All in all I cant recommend this hotel highly enough, The location is great, we had a great stay, nothing was too much trouble, the staff were all so friendly and would love to go back again one day.",5,2016,07,18
228,Good business hotel,"The Hilton Garden Inn is very conveniently located a 5-10 minute walk from the main railway station and a similar distance to the congress centre, but not knowing where I was going I took a taxi - and just as well I did, as the hotel had changed from a Jurys Inn (that I had been booked into!) only a couple of weeks previously. This is a perfect business hotel - all you would expect - modern, clean, efficiently run. Only stayed one night, and had to miss breakfast due to the congress I was attending, so can't comment on that.",4,2016,07,18
228,Excellent!,"Excellent stay, would stay again! One of the best breakfast we have had! Staff were very helpful and friendly, ideal location for the city centre, with a bus route right outside, 20 minutes walk to Temple Bar or €8 in a cab. Hopefully see you again soon! ",5,2016,07,17
228,A good hotel in a good location,"The Hilton Garden Inn was a good choice for us. Centrally located and reasonably priced for our one night stay in Dublin.

The family room was nice and big, so we had plenty of space.

The room was a bit stuffy and didn't seem to be air-conditioned (so it got a bit smelly and was a bit too warm at one point). Other than that it was good.

Breakfast was included and we enjoyed this.

Parking (a separate business to the hotel) was convenient and well priced.",4,2016,07,16
228,Not Jury's Inn,Don't let the signs in the car park confuse - it used to be a Jury's Inn hotel hence the signs still say that.  Beware no air conditioning in July 2016.  Book ahead to get the cheap car parking.  Bus tour info was good.,3,2016,07,16
228,Excellent location to main city Centre,"Recently visited for a conference. Excellent location and well connected to airports. Get a but to and from airport just outside the hotel. 5 mins walk to the conference centre. 
Good rooms, restaurant and bar. 
Hotels in Dublin are quite pricey.... certainly the ones around the conference centre were more costly than even perhaps London",4,2016,07,16
228,Couldn't have asked for better!,"Myself and my boyfriend had planned a packed day in Dublin and decided to drop our bags off at the hotel. We arrived at 11 to find our room was ready early which had the day off to a great start. It was close to temple bar and as we had stayed for a concert in croke park it was not far from there either. Breakfast next day was of very high standard - the make your own waffles are a lovely extra touch!!
There has been previous complaints about the heat but the fan in the room controlled this and we had the best sleep ever.
Will definately return 😊😊",5,2016,07,15
228,Perfect Hotel,The location of this hotel makes it ideal for touring the area.  It is an easy walk to the Temple Bar Area.  We bought a 72 hour bus pass to get around (includes hop on hop off and airport transport).  Bus stop was right outside the hotel.  Our room was on the top floor with a nice view of the river.   Hotel had just changed to the Hilton Family so everything had been updated and was new.,5,2016,07,14
228,Unexpected ,"Had this hotel booked for myself , was taken over and looks like everything has been refurbished , rooms are spotless and lovely , receptionist was very nice and showed an interest in what we were down for , easy to drop off our luggage , in centre of town , cabs sitting outside and parking around the corner ",5,2016,07,14
228,Good breakfast but otherwise mediocre ,"I made the mistake firstly of booking through laterooms who charged more than the Hilton without breakfast! The room was so hot and smelt. The hotel provided a second fan for the room.  The beds were supposed to be queen size but were smaller than our bed at home. On the positive though is the location, just 10 minutes walk from the city centre and the breakfast was fantastic. With a little work such as air conditioning, new bed (that is comfortable) and effective cleaning this would be worth the money. However when I brought these things to the receptionists attention I was treated very well. Once the hotel is fitted with air conditioning then I will be happy to stay again ",3,2016,07,13
228,Places to Stay in Dublin,"It was a clean hotel, nothing exceptional for the amount of money per night. Rooms were fairly small. The rate was different each night depending on the time of week. A little to steep most nights for what you receive.",3,2016,07,13
228,Comfortable hotel in a good location (but no A/C in the rooms!),"Modern place, very helpful personnel, good location - 10-15 minute walk to Temple bar, yet, this is a much calmer district. Also one can walk along the river, nice, when it's sunny. Good breakfast. Comfortable bed. Wifi in the room was stable. 

However, there is no air conditioner in the room, which really surprised me for a Hilton Garden hotel. Even at +20C during the sunny day it was not too hot, but hot. I can't imagine, what happens if it gets warmer in summer.

Just work out the solution with the A/C and don't double the price of the stay for that, and you'll be great!",4,2016,07,11
228,Nothing special,"I spotted this new Hilton when I was planning a one night trip to Dublin and decided to try it out. It was up on €200 per night, so my expectations were set pretty high. The hotel is on the river front, near the Sean O'Casey bridge. I soon worked out that this used to be the Jury's Inn and some taxi drivers knew it by that name, not the Hilton. According to the papers it has has a makeover and it certainly looked nice in the reception/bar area. The check in was speedy and I was soon up in my room. The room was clean and modern, apart from the bathroom which was clean, but the sink and toilet were of a style that gave the impression of a less expensive establishment. Cheap and cheerful springs to mind, so I am guessing something that didn't get refurbished. The other thing that really lets the place down and will be tough to resolve is no air con. While I admit I have no air con at home, I have lots of windows that I can open at each end of the house to get a breeze flowing, you can't do that in a hotel room. Plus the one window you can open, only tilts a few inches which is lucky because by 4am the seagulls outside were singing. There was a fan, which helped, but it felt too warm in the room and it wasn't a particularly hot day. Everything else was OK, but this was not worth the money. When asked if I enjoyed my stay, I did say that I was hot and they deducted €30 from the bill, so that made it slightly more palatable. As the Burlington doesn't have air con in every room, I've booked the Morrison for my next trip in August. ",3,2016,07,09
228,Great Stay,"We stayed in room 529 first week of July.  Staff was hospitable.  Rooms were a bit compact, but in general comfortable.  If staying, pl choose a room facing the water as other views aren't nice. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,09
228,"Impressed, but with some reservations","The desk staff is five star; friendly, helpful and good problem solvers.
The restaurant staff is five star, great service - the breakfasts were the best we encountered in 2 weeks in Ireland.
The room is four star: too much bedding.
The bath is three star: nice looking but not very practical - no counter space, and the tub is small, deep and slippery -  do not recommend this place for seniors.
Location is mixed: very good for business but not great for tourists.
I paid for two rooms for three nights (six room nights) and they say I don't get Hilton Honors points because I made the reservation before it became a Hilton Garden Inn? Now that is just bad manners. I wonder what the bus groups get?
Car park is OK. Lobby and bar are good but they play very loud music in the lobby at times and the TVs in the lobby either don't work or are too loud.",4,2016,07,08
228,"Great Location, friendly staff, clean","This property has just been converted from a Jury Inn to a Hilton property.  It is located conveniently on the busline and is within easy walking distance of museums and the old town.  From the airport you can take the airlink bus (10 euro round trip) that will drop you off directly in front of the hotel (note:  it's still called the Jury Inn on the bus map).  Our room faced directly on to Quay Street, which is quite busy, but luckily the windows were sound tight and we didn't hear much noise.  There is no air conditioning, but in Dublin you really don't need any . . . . .).  The hop on hop off buses (yellow and green) both stop in front of the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel.  The area is in a little bit of a food desert.  There is a Bento oriental across the street, a burger place, and an Italian pizza - pasta place a couple blocks away.  Not much for early morning breakfast options if you need to head out early to catch a day tour -- our tours left close to O'Connell Street so we ended up going to (cringe) McDonalds as it was the only thing we could find open at 0730 in the morning.  You could probably find something closer to the nightlife, but this suited us fine.",4,2016,07,08
228,Mr Kirk,You could say we stayed in a construction site the weekend of Bruce Springstins concerts. We were an inconvenience to the staff who were over whelmed with change of name and up grade works but they still took 360.00 euros for our overnight stay.,1,2016,07,08
228,Great location - and bus to airport stops in front of the hotel!,"Reading the reviews, some complained it was ""far"" from city center, but I actually appreciated it wasn't in the heart of the hustle and bustle (read noise!) as it was Pride weekend and the streets were littered with drunk people ALL.DAY. 

It's a short .5M/10 minute walk to city center for the hop on/off buses and 10-15 min walk to Temple Bar. 

The hotel switched from Jury Inn to Hilton Garden Inn 3 weeks before our stay and the bedding, toiletries, and amenities were up to Hilton standards/perfect. Good solid blinds to keep the sun out too as it sets around 1030PM and rises before 5AM.

The biggest plus for us was that we used the bus to go to Monaghan and the airport and the stop was literally in front of the hotel. With the unpredictable weather/rain, that was clutch.",4,2016,07,07
228,Perfect hotel for 3Arena and a short walk to O'Connell Street,"Stayed here for Don Henley Concert at 3Arena
The staff are amazing,so friendly,
Nothing too much trouble...
Food excellent, 
Breakfast, absolutely gorgeous.
Only thing missing is a beer garden!!!
Highly recommend......",4,2016,07,03
228,"Good for families, clean, comfy","Wish it was closer to the city center, but it's only a short 1/2 mile walk. Good for families and has restaurant with breakfast buffet downstairs. Easy parking behind hotel. Not a great location if you want to walk down to a pub late night... It's In the business district. Stay in Temple Bar if looking for that. But for me was great with kids and easy parking to go on day trips from Dublin. Be sure to get your parking ticket validated!",4,2016,07,02
228,Only Adequate,"Great location, smart appearance, clean and rooms well appointed with one major exception... a method of keep the room at a comfortable temperature. 

To let you understand, Dublin during our four day stay in July, the average temperature was 15°C, the room on the 4th floor was absolutely stifling, obviously a known issue, as an electric fan was already provided to blow the warm air around. The window only opened slightly from the top, which had the only bonus of letting the traffic noise in. 

The staff were all very pleasant, polite and helpful.

It might also be wise to take with you a paper confirmation of your booking and board basis, as each of the four mornings, the provision of evidence was required to demonstrate that breakfast was included in the booking. As a final point on this, on checking out, a bill had been made for the payment of breakfasts.

Only one other slight gripe, on the Saturday, the room was not made until 17:40, having been vacated since 09:00.",3,2016,07,02
228,Nice hotel,"The room was of good size with all required amenities. The room did get too hot, though, unless you opened the windrow and out the fan in it. The buffet breakfast was excellent with made to order omelettes and waffle irons along with a variety of hot and cold items. Laundry facilities on site which was great, but only 1 washer and 1 dryer so you have to wait awhile to get use of it. The location was a bit farther than we wanted from town and required a 15 minute walk, but overall this hotel was very good. ",4,2016,07,02
228,Fabulous hotel in great location,"Lovely friendly welcome , rooms very clean and spacious , bathrooms modern and clean.  Full breakfast menu and the waffles were delicious . The location of hotel is close enough to city centre and great views over the River Liffey . All staff we came in contact with were polite and friendly . Beds really comfy . Throughly enjoyed our stay .",5,2016,07,01
228,Great Hotel,"We finished our Cosmos Tour here. What a delight when we arrived. Modern and the room was great with all requirements, large TV etc. Breakfast was one of the best we came across. Staff were good and efficient.100% recommend.",5,2016,06,30
228,a great stay,This hotel was a great find amazing room excellat service by all staff we only are breakfast there but this catered for every need the location is brilliant in the quiter zone but good bars in walking distance and the hop on hop bus stop is outside and this is an excellent way to see the city if you are lucky enough to get on a live commentary bus the drivers are fantastic giving you great information about the sites of Dublin .also the hotel is on the airport bus route so this is also useful ,5,2016,06,30
228,Nice hotel nearby historical center,"We had a very nice stay at the Garden Inn. Reception staff all great. Special thanks to Patricia for helping us out with check-in and tourist information.
We had a room facing the rear of the hotel by choice as we wanted a quiet room.
The rooms are spacious for European standards. Nice bathroom. Fridge in the room.",5,2016,06,29
228,Unfriendly staff in the bar and resturants,"Unfriendly staff in the bar and resturants. They could not make a correct order on food or drinks. No Air Conditioning in the rooms. Just a small fan, that did not help the cooling of the rooms but made a lot of noise when trying to sleep.",2,2016,06,28
228,"Good location, top hotel for groups or couples","Price quality is top, hotel has recently been refurbished and rooms were very clean and modern. Location is good, prob 10min walk from Temple Bar but you are close to the financial center, on the river (nice walk dep on weather), quickly in and out of town. We spend 3 days there and walked everywhere from the hotel.
Service was good, all friendly and professional and accommodated last minute changes. Breakfast is decent...coffee is not good though...but you have a Costa Coffee (chargeable) bar as an alternative inside.",4,2016,06,28
228,Business Trip to Meet Customers,"When we booked the hotel it was called the Jury inn, Customs House, when we arrived it had been re-branded the Hilton Garden Inn.  We'd paid for an Executive room but I'm not sure what exactly we got for our money over and above the standard room.  However............

The bed was enormous and sooooooo comfortable. Several times, I woke up and had to search for the missus to make sure she hadn't gone missing in the night, that's how big the bed seemed.  

The room was of a high standard, I especially liked the USB charging facilities in the power sockets (must get me some of those for the house!).  The bathroom was large, well equipped and unlike a lot of places had a really nice shower.  

In room tea/coffee making facilities were provided with a good selection of beverages and biscuits each day plus a complimentary newspaper.  Wifi was free and very fast which again is extremely useful

The only downside was no A/C but they did provide a fan and the windows opened, so not so bad.

There is a large bar and dining area on the ground floor although we only had breakfast there. Ireland were playing France on the Saturday night so it was a little noisy for us, but they were a friendly bunch and obviously having a great time.  

Breakfast seemed to cover all bases and if it didn't they'd make you something to order.  The food was very fresh, tasty and not over cooked unlike a lot of hotel breakfasts.

The hotel is located between the International Conference Centre and The International Financial Service Centre, so basically right in the middle of the business district.  That said it's a 10-15min walk to the centre and O'Connell Street and the famous Post Office, centre of the Easter Uprising.

Getting there is easy, there is a bus service (747) from terminal 1 or 2, Dublin Airport that drops you almost outside the hotel.  The trip back is even easier, the stop is right outside the hotel. It takes about 30mins and costs €6 one way, €10 return (valid for 3 or 4 months I believe)",4,2016,06,27
228,Good quality comfortable and modern hotel in very convenient location ,"Good quality comfortable and modern hotel in very convenient location. Was the Jurys Inn originally, now recently renamed the Hilton. Clean and comfortable rooms, good showers, very good cooked breakfast, easy access to airport as well as the city center. Would recommend. ",4,2016,06,27
228,a FAQ hotel,"Nothing to complain about the global appeal of the hotel, but:
- the room was quite small, very little space  avaiable.
- no AC  in the rooms -  a chinese fan on the desk, that's it, to reduce the room temperature-  the Windows could open just a bit - for security reason I assume, but surely not enough to gran a proper ventilation.
- no complimentary water in the room .But of course was for sale on the main floor, but only sparkling.
- asked an unbrella  for a walk, they say only for sale as many have been given and not returned. SO I had to buy one for 2 €  that got broken after 2 hours.
-  30 minutes in the bar waiting to  receive our food order, and  what received  was a wrong one (and not in the rush hour of the restaurant).

...and all above for 170 € a night, sorry, it is too much for me to give a positive judgment.",2,2016,06,27
228,24 Hours in Dublin,Originally booked this hotel before the rebrand/refurbishment (when it was Jury's Inn and they were doing a special) so had no idea what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised by the result. Hotel was spotless and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. It's a short walk from the centre of town (no more than 10 minutes) but it's quite a long walk to the Aviva stadium (30 minutes plus) - we were there to see Rihanna - so get a taxi if you can!,5,2016,06,27
228,concert trip,Was is in Dublin for a concert had a great stay staff very helpful only thing is I thought 200 euro for a Tuesday night was a bit expensive hotel is in a great location will probably return later this year,5,2016,06,25
228,Rebranded Jurys is a great new Hilton,Great hotel with excellent service . About a 15-20 minute walk from main sights of Dublin so keep that in mind. Clean and spacious rooms and good breakfast in the morning. Very friendly staff from front desk to valets,5,2016,06,25
228,great location for concerts,for concert goes this hotel is ideally located. just a short walk to the 3 Arena. Good bar food menu for a quick bite before the show. Accommodation is quite expensive but the rooms are really lovely.,5,2016,06,24
228,Another generic hotel - adequate but nothing memorable or remarkable.,"I spent 4 nights here staying for a conference at the Dublin Convention Centre. It was easy to get to on the airport-bus (10Euro open return). The hotel is clean and smartly presented. My room was made available later than expected which was a bit of a nuisance. The room was a very generic queen bed room. Facilities were all functional but minimalistic. A small bathroom. 

I do occasionally use room-service. This hotel provides a very basic lunch/dinner room service, at an additional 5Euro fee. Remarkably, there is no breakfast room service - only the full breakfast buffet served in the hotel restaurant downstairs. I don't think I've ever been to a commercial chain hotel that doesn't do breakfast room service. Even the service they provide ends at 10pm. Again I found this remarkable - all of the times I've relied on room service have been out of usual business hours, when all other places are shut. I would have thought that was the entire point of hotels having room service - to cater for travellers who frequently land at obscure times and are often just tired and hungry. Bizarre. 

The room did have wifi and it ran perfectly well. I managed to get a good night's sleep each night and wasn't disturbed by street noise.

Ameneties - I have come to expect good hotels to just have a decent repertoire of toiletries, both in-room complementary ones and those available for purchase.. I've come to expect the really good ones to give more substantial stuff away free. This Hilton however - I was given a tiny bar of soap and perhaps 10mLs of shower gel, neither of which were replenished during the stay until I asked. I was given a shampoo and conditioner that were empty. A kettle and a couple of tea and coffee sachets - nothing fancy. Gone seem to be the days where hotels would renew your toiletries daily or provide you with a selection of teas and hot chocolates and fresh milk in the fridge! I did go downstairs in search of toothpaste. I was offered a 2mL packet of toothpaste, exactly the sort you receive on aeroplanes, for 2 Euros! Needless to say I went to the local Tesco instead. 

Overall a really bog-standard stay. A stark reminder that not all Hilton's are equal. The brand Hilton I feel has diluted itself down to include even this basic service. Soon I feel I will come to expect nothing more than four walls and a roof over my head when I book under the name of Hilton...",2,2016,06,24
228,Excellent hotel,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted with with very friendly staff and a lovely spacious and very clean reception..

It was about a 10 minute walk from Connolly train station and about a 20 minute walk into city centre which was quite close!   
At the time we were there the hotel had recently changed ownership from ""jury's inn"" to Hilton Garden Inn so was getting a bit of a revamp but it didn't deter in any services whatsoever. Our room was front view and I think was one of the rooms that had undergone a revamp and was beautiful and comfortable. Free wifi was also good!

The breakfast selection was outstanding and very tasty!

Highly recommended this hotel!",5,2016,06,24
228,Does the job,"Good location, comfortable bed and spacious room. Breakfast could be better as the designed areas are close to the main entrance so there was a constant flow of people walking by where I was. Also the choice of food was a little basic & could be improved.",3,2016,06,23
228,"Nice room, good food but stuffy rooms","The hotel is by the river, among banks and finance companies and is about 10 minutes walk from O'Connell st and the main shopping district. It is well served by all forms of transport- a short walk to trains, trams and airport  bus routes just outside.

This hotel would get 4 points if there was air conditioning, The first night I couldn't sleep because it was too hot without the window open and the fan on full.There was road noise until very late.I noticed that the bar and restaurant areas were also very hot with no fans or windows. I hate to think what it would be like in a  rare Dublin heatwave. 
That said it is a nice hotel, though staff comments suggest that there are some teething problems with the switch from Jury's Inn to the Hilton brand.
Ask for a river view room, the view is lovely at all times of day.  The room was bright and clean.
Breakfast was very good, fresh and tasty.",3,2016,06,22
228,Disappointing stay,"We booked the hotel when it was Jury Inn in 2015 via booking.com for 5 adults. 1 twin room & 1 triple room. 

On arrival to what is now the Hilton Garden Inn we were informed by the receptionist that the triple room was only booked for 1 person, why would you book a triple room for 1 person ?? Clearly this was not the case and After much debate with the reception staff they agreed not to charge us for the 2 people but we were told we would have to pay for 2 additional breakfasts if we required. As you can imagine this was not a great start to what was meant to be a weekend away in Dublin. 

When we got to our triple room it was clear that it was not a triple room, as it was the same size and layout as the twin room. The room was not designed for 3 adults, there were only 2 beds none of which were a standard double, 2 glasses, 2 cups etc. So not only were we asked to pay for 2 more guests which we believed had been paid for,  we didn't actual receive the room we had booked. The stay was uncomfortable the room was far to small and hot, we had to leave the window open and fan on which was noisey and lead to lack of sleep. 

The cleanliness of the room is much to be desired, as we found an eye makeup box behind the bedroom curtain which belonged to a previous guest. 

On the morning of our departure 3 of our friends had breakfast in the dinning room, which had been paid for and myself and a friend join them as we waited for our taxi to the airport. Myself and a friend did not have breakfast we were merely talking to our friends but to my amazement the hotel charged my credit card with 2 breakfasts that we never received and also failed to inform me that they had taken the money from my account without my acknowledgement. 

We were all disappointed with our stay at the Hilton, we felt that they wanted to gain more money from us to what was originally agreed when we booked the hotel in 2015. We would not recommend the hotel.",1,2016,06,22
228,Very modern and clean,"Good place to stay...central location and walking distance to Connelly station.  Friendly staff.  Clean, well kept.  Room is warm though, was looking for a thermostat before I realized there was no AC.  The name of this hotel recently changed and no one sent me a notification (booked through Expedia).  Would have been helpful to know I was looking for a Hilton and Jury's. ",4,2016,06,20
228,Not Quite a Hilton,"We spent 4 days staying at this Hotel, it is stop 3 on the Airlink Express to and from Airport, it is however a 10-20 minute walk from the south side attractions...ideal for walking dinner off not so ideal when your feet ache after long days touring.

Reception ...lounge and bar areas are very nice, we found breakfast to be of good selection and quality, in truth the bar prices for alcohol matched that of Temple Bar, staff were pleasant. 

Now to the rooms we were on the second floor facing the river, we thought the room spacious and clean and tastefully decorated.

There were two negatives to our room (213) firstly it was an adjoining room - simply put we could hear the occupants of next door snoring loudly, talking moving about etc. as they were late night party people this did effect our sleep for two of the nights.

The biggest minus for me was the lack of air conditioning - this had to be balanced by opening the window which resulted in traffic - pedestrian noise from the main road below.

Price wise as regular Hilton guests we found the price a little expensive compared to UK costs. 

In short we will be returning to Dublin but will probably not return to this accommodation, however if you don't mind the extra cost, walk to and from and noise you will be fine.

6/10.",3,2016,06,19
228,Amazing for concerts at 3arena,"Booked 2 nights here to go to a concert at the 3arena. If you're looking for a place to stay whilst at a concert this is definitely you're place as it's on the same road and just a 10/15 minute walk down. It's right on the river so amazing views and is just a 10 minute walk down the road to the city centre. Transport from the airport is extremely simple, just jump on the 747 and it drops you off outside the hotel and there's a stop outside the door to take you back - amazing! Check in was very straight forward and although i booked a room with one bed they offered a room with an extra bed for no extra charge. The room was immaculate and had everything you need, a fridge, safe, fan, hair dryer, plenty of towels, very comfy pillows, large flat screen TV, little shampoos etc. The bathroom was very modern and all the drawers and cupboard doors were anti-slam and the room had 2 large mirrors. We ate at the restaurant the first night and payed around 17 euros for a meal which is great value considering I couldn't fault the standard. I'd recommend the prawn linguine! 
The hotel was fairly quiet and peaceful which i wasn't expecting after reading previous reviews and i had no problem sleeping, beds very comfortable. I had seen a lot of reviews saying there is no A/C so it was too hot however i didn't find this to be a factor that affected my stay as the small fan provided did provide some help and i think the rest of the hotel makes up for having a bit of heat. 
Although my overall stay was great, there were a few things that could be improved which is mainly down to the management/staff side. The first night we went to the restaurant it was not clear where to sit or where to order so we asked a member of staff where to sit and she replied ""anywhere you like"" after sitting down the same member of staff came and told us we weren't allowed to sit where we had chosen which was a bit confusing? because everywhere else was full of loud groups at the bar which is the last place you want to sit and eat a meal. When we finally realised we had to order food at the bar me and my friend wanted to order together and after giving her one item she had already tilled it through and charged me, after my friend gave her meal order the same staff member tilled that through without asking if we had finished so we ended up having to order 4 items separate. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay however the staff and instructions on what to do at the bar/restaurant need to be more clear however I would stay again and recommend it.",4,2016,06,17
228,Hotel by the Liffey,"Stayed during a weekend trip for 3 nights. We arrived late - 2 AM and felt welcome just the same. Our room had riverview with sight to the Calatrava harpbridge and the famineboat. The bed and pillow were extremely confortable. We missed the AC, since the weather was very moist. The breakfast was very good.The location was good, with most attractions in walkingdistance.",4,2016,06,17
228,Great standard,"Clean modern hotel with comfy beds and decent breakfast. The view from the window was crap, but we had chosen cheap rooms so we had ourselves to blame. 
There is something liberating with these 00s hotels that all look the same. You won't get annoyed with anything, the experience is smooth, like the surface of the cashier where you check in. 
And when you leave, you hardly remember that you were there. ",4,2016,06,17
228,New name...even better than before,"Stayed here for 2 nights this week. Our second visit, but first since the hotel changed over to Hilton & we hoped that it would be as good as before. It was even better. Updated & upgraded public areas were great. Everywhere very clean, airy and bright. Great choice and quality for breakfast. 
Our bedroom was great too. Very clean and fresh with crisp white bed linen. Tea/coffee making stuff in room. Bathroom compact and pleasant. Lovely fluffy white towels. Only gripe is that room was too hot making sleep elusive. Although we were told that air conditioning is being installed. 
We will go back again for another visit.",4,2016,06,16
228,Pleasant stay,I stay in Dublin quite a lot and this was under a different name until a week ago. Anyway it looks like it has had a light make over. Reception staff helpful and pleasant. I arrived last due to a flight delay. Unfortunately the room service and Restaurant finish at 10.00. no 24 hr room service. The have a sandwich machine in reception. Not anywhere close enough to eat quickly by walking. Breakfast was good. Large choice. Room was clean and comfortable but quite hot. I was on the 3rd floor and having the window open was a little noisy. Overall a good stay and would use again. Free wifi was good.,4,2016,06,16
228,Good location!,"Good hotel, would have given a higher rating if the rooms were equipped with air conditioning. The room stayed warm not withstanding lack of heating and open window. Staff very helpful and friend;ly, free wifi and breakfast excellent",3,2016,06,15
228,"New name, service and location still great",Stayed here as part of a group but was still given great service. The rooms are spacious and light and kept to a high standard. Central to O'Connel St and the ferry wharf for England. Breakfast is of good quality with the biggest scones ever. Staff are only to willing to help you get around. Good hotel for a Dublin stay.,5,2016,06,14
228,"Promises, promises","Booked this months ago, in the interim period the hotel changed hands.  Received a lovely email stating don't worry, no changes to your booking!  So I arrive at the checking in time, to be told rather coldly, the checking in time has changed come back in an hour.

It would have been easy enough to make a very small effort to let people know, having arrived some hours previously guests could have easily have just stayed out an extra hour rather than wasting sitting on a park bench.

Not a good first impression, and a hotel chain trading on their partner's reputation obviously, as you would think it would not be beyond Hilton's wit to make guests comfortable during the delay your organisation has caused them.

Telling people to go away because you are not ready, when they have arrived at the checking in time scheduled when they booked is pretty poor planning indeed, and please stop giving people the 'you can check in at 2pm but we do not guarantee a room will be available for you' line as that is not checking into a hotel is it?",1,2016,06,12
228,Nice but so hot,"All this hotel needs to make it perfect is Air con! Which it is getting in September 16 so if your visiting after that I'd say book! Quite location close to city but not in the noise of temple bar! Nice rooms, lovely gym, good breakfast and nice bar! 
The only trouble was it is too hot to sleep in June! We did have a desk fan and one open window but still very warm! It's just moved from jury's inn to Hilton and as a HHonors member I expected more but know once a AC is in it will be perfect!

I would say breakfast was lush! 

Although due to switch in records from jury's inn to Hilton we were refused one breakfast on final day despite have 2 per room on previous 2 days! Did make me feel uncomfortable arguing to get my breakfast and the lady ringing reception to check we weren't 'stealing' coffee and a bagel! But we sorted it !",4,2016,06,12
228,Good Quality but no air conditioning,"This is a fantastic venue if you are going to an event at the 3 arena . It's a 10 minute walk . Hotel has just been rebranded from Jury's Inn . Every part of the hotel is well appointed and stylish . The rooms are large and comfortable .Staff are friendly . Breakfast is great but expensive if you don't have it in your booking deal . The area is being regenerated with some very good restaurants and pubs springing up .The wifi is fast and free .The only downside is that there is no air conditioning , well at leat not in our room and the heat was oppresive . A small fan was provided and the window opeened wide but it was still impossible to sleep . We did receive a discount when we checked out because of this . receptionist reckons that aircon will be fitted as part of the upgrade .",4,2016,06,12
228,Hey it's warm in Ireland!,"So now that everyone knows hotels in Ireland don't do air conditioning we can move on! The breakfast here is sooooo much better than any of the Drurys associated hotels. There's an omelet station. And fresh fruit. Yay. There are fans in the closet which is the best you can do. Added plus, got a king size bed in the room, also a rarity in Ireland and prob all of Europe. Staff quite helpful. ",5,2016,06,11
228,Worthy stay,"A decent option to stay especially for solo travelers. Comfortable rooms, excellence hospitality, helpful staff makes it all a worthy stay. Irish breakfast has options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.",5,2016,06,10
228,"Great location to city centre, main concert arenas","Great hotel, friendly professional staff and spotlessly clean. I dislike having to pay for parking, but then that is just me and not specific to this hotel! They serve food in the bar until midnight which is just fantastic when you come back tired and hungry after a concert. It was delicious too. The renovations were poorly managed at times but the staff acted quickly and efficiently. I have stayed before and would stay again. ",5,2016,06,10
228,Great hotel,"Stayed here for one night, room had been recently redecorated. Great job done, beautiful colours and wall art. Bed was comfy, shower was fab! Beautiful breakfast for inky €10.50! Def worth it! Would def recommend and would stay here again.",4,2016,06,10
228,perfect!,"Perfect location to be passed quickly in the center but not in the chaos of the bustling Dublin night worldly life. bus stop to and from the airport outside the hotel. clean, spacious, great breakfast. Board!",5,2016,06,10
228,overnight stay,Comfortable room with mini fridge which was very useful during summer weather. Bed and bathroom clean and well presented. Breakfast had a good range to choose from and very tasty. Access using luas tram to city center is temporally replaced by bus service during upgrade works.,4,2016,06,10
228,Good enough..,The room was clean and tidy enough but no water or biscuits provided which may be a bit picky! The room was ridiculously hot and the bed was rock solid. Not the best considering its recent change from a Jury's Inn. ,3,2016,06,09
228,My first taste of Dublin,"After a little confusion, we wrongly thought the hotel was in the old Custom House which was dark and locked up on our arrival, we found the Hilton.  We had been allocated a large corner room on the third floor with Windows giving us wonderful views of the river.  It was a warm summer evening and a magical sight.  The hotel suited us well, we could walk to all the sights we wanted to see, the breakfast was excellent, the beds comfortable and the staff, without exception were friendly and helpful.  Only snag - the road is noisy and an inspection cover n the road needed to be fixed to prevent very noisy clanking but we wouldn't have missed the view so were prepared to put up with the noise!",5,2016,06,09
228,Hot,"Couldn't really fault our stay. Only reason not 5star review was that it was so hot at night. No water provided in room or biscuits, Picky I know. Other than that it was fabulous. Breakfast was stunning and couldn't be faulted and believe you me between us we ate a huge selection. ",4,2016,06,07
228,Springsteen weekend,"Arrival could have been improved by direct reference in reservation information to the convenience of the adjacent car park. We stayed on the weekend of transition of branding. Smell of fresh paint was to be expected, but . Lots happening in Dublin that weekend so prices were very highgenerally work was not disruptive. Rooms weld decorated and furnished. Staff very friendly and helpful ",4,2016,06,07
228,New hotel ,"We also booked as Jury and arrived to find we were at the Hilton, which made finding reception from the car park interesting.  We had a family room on the sixth floor and it was a fantastic room, two large doubles and acres of room, lovely big bathroom.  The view was impressive and the hotel is within a lovely easy walk to main areas of  Dublin.  However far too warm in room as Windows only opened slightly.  There was a fan in the cupboard which we missed.  Updated with air con would make this a jewel. Breakfast faultless. ",4,2016,06,07
228,Hotel is a construction site - hammering and noise all over - no sleep,Our stay was terrible and way overpriced for the accommodations.  The hotel is under renovations and hammering and jackhammers started at 6:30am.  The rate of 440 Euro for one night's stay was due to Bruce Springsteen concert in town.  The beds are like rocks and the noise made it impossible to get any sleep.  The staff was friendly but everything was under construction and workmen were all over the hotel banging and drilling away.  Not a restful stay at all.,1,2016,06,07
228,Good experience - Jury's to Hilton Garden Inn,"I reserved this when it was called Jury's Custom House Inn but as of June 1, 2016 (the day we checked in) it is now a Hilton Garden Inn.  It appears to have been completely refurbished with a nice, modern look and feel.  The staff was a bit unsure of some things on their first day, but there were no major problems. The room was comfortable and nicely decorated, and very clean.  The one disadvantage that we experienced is that the guest rooms appear to have no air conditioning and on our visit the skies were clear with temperatures around 70 F.  The sun made our room very warm (hot, actually), and the window barely opened.  The buffet breakfast was excellent, with a ""full Irish"" breakfast as well as baked goods, scrambled eggs, cereal, made to order omelets, juices, etc.  The free internet worked fine.",4,2016,06,05
228,Great ,"We stayed two night. There is no construction or renovation going on now the 3 hotel looks great new carpet in the hall way. The rooms are large and clean the only diwn dide is no airconitioning and it was warm when we where there you opened the windows and the street noise was very bad. The breakfast was 1st rate best breakfast in 20 days while on tour.
Location is ok but a bit far if you can't wslk to far. ",5,2016,06,04
228,The best of times at the worst of times,"While I was staying at the Jury's Inn it became a Hilton hotel.  There were tradesmen working through day and night to get things done with the minimal disruption. The staff, although they must've been thoroughly fed up with it all, were pleasant and really tried to give the best of service.  I understand there were problems with the computer change over, but I paid on arrival before the change over so I was not very affected.  
So this was not the best time to be at the hotel, but the way it was all handled was the best the staff could've done under the circumstance. I hope to return when the hotel has settled in a bit, I'm sure it will be great.  The bed was comfy and I could even get real air through the window. This is not a cheap hotel, but for me it was good value.",4,2016,06,04
228,Excellent staff,"We stayed at the Jury Inn during the renovations in late May. We had a medical emergency while there, and I couldn't have been more impressed with the kindness and helpfulness of the staff, in particular Marta, Declan, and the Saturday day manager (whose name we did not catch).",4,2016,06,04
228,Really good,"I had the ""privilege"" of being the first diamond Hhonors member to visit the hotel, 2 days after it became part of the Hilton group. 

The location is great for central Dublin. Csilla in the bar was wonderful, irreverent and funny and a joy.

The beds are comfortable, cleanliness is perfect. Yes, Garden Inn is close to the bottom of the Hilton family group, but this is a good to great hotel. 

Why 4 not 5 stars? It's June, weather in Dublin is as hot as it gets (23C) and there's no air conditioning. The building is refurbished but 20 years old, so... no AC. Still, great hotel. ",4,2016,06,03
228,Okay but noisy,"This was our hotel for our last night's stay in Ireland. Very convenient to the airport and close to some restaurants right around the corner including a nice little market. The hotel has just transitioned to a Hilton property so there is still some work being done. Overall though it does look in good shape. There is a parking garage right around the corner that connects to the hotel. I think it's about 9 euros a day. Be aware though that garage closes at 10 pm so if you are out and about just be aware.  This hotel is also the meeting place for the Games of Thrones tour, which we went on and had a great time. The hotel has all the Hilton uniqueness you would expect. I tend to favor them over Marriott these days. Our rooms were nice but hot. There is no AC in the hotel. I know it's Ireland and why would you need it but the room was very stuffy and the window could only be cracked ever so slightly. Bathroom was okay with nice toiletries and soft towels. Overall I gave it an above average rating. I think it's a decent hotel for in and out of Dublin but not a weeklong tourist stay. ",3,2016,06,03
228,Derren Brown dublin,"Me and my partner stayed here for a one night stay end of may, I mean the room was nice in a great location but the staffs communication skills were poor!  I don't mind a bit of building work during my stay as long as i am warned about it, its one of those everyday things. Again with communication the fire alarm went off atleast 6 times in one day we had no warning and no apology.

Apart from that its a bed to sleep in in a good location.",3,2016,06,03
228,Under construction ,"Stayed during the transition from the jury's inn to the Hilton.  The construction started early in the morning and ran well into the late evening 8/9pm. The room was large, clean and comfortable.  Nice perk to have costa coffee in the lobby. I did not use the restaurant. It looked as though they were installing a fitness center.  The hotel is a nice location with an easy walk in any direction.   ",4,2016,06,02
228,THINK CAREFULLY,"We booked into Jurys Inn Hotel among a load of building work that was going on!! To be informed that the chain had been taken over by Hilton.  The room was noisy, cold. The only good thing about this hotel was the breakfast in the morning which was plentiful. ",3,2016,06,02
228,Unfriendly and unhelpful staff,"Hotel undergoing change over so many builders around at the time. Reception staff very unfriendly and unhelpful. Room very clean, hotel as a whole very clean. Housekeeping stuff very friendly. Value for more poor ",2,2016,06,02
228,"Good location, with a catch.....","When I booked this hotel it was called Jurys Inn. When I get there I see that the sign outside has been changed to Hilton! You can imagine my bafflement, together with the taxi driver who knew nothing about this. No reference to this fact was made at the time of booking. No email was sent to me prior to my trip to warn me about these changes!
Checked in the 29/05 roughly at 23:00, the following morning a letter is put under my door to say that there would be ""essential work taking place"" in my room! Wonderful customer service, only 6 hours prior I was given the room and no mention was made to this. So I get to the reception, and I am offered free drinks or I can get another room for free. I choose to get a new room; but surprise surprise no rooms are available! How strange!
Next day, new letter under the door! This time I am asked to settle my bill before 31/05 if I want a Jurys Inn invoice, otherwise after the 01/06 I would get two invoices. So, again, the customer has to adapt to their issues. Got to the reception, settled the bill, after some gimmick with the system.
Personnell is nice, apologetic, so it can only be management's fault. They have obviously put their financial results ahead of customer satisfaction! It would have cost them very little to put, I don't know, a fruit basket in the room with Management Team's apologies for the inconvenience. Do you think after this experience I'll get a Hilton fidelity card? Sure!
They did not think even once to close the hotel for a few days while renovation work is carried out, therefore be prepared to share corridors and the bar with workers going about their tasks (painting, redecorating, replacement of their IT system, etc.)
Also, be adviced that rooms have no air conditioning system, at all. You are given an hoscillating fan, that's it. We are still in the 19th century. It was rather hot during my stay and even with the window open I could not cope too well.
My recommendation : stay away! There are plenty of other choices around that location.",3,2016,06,02
228,Excellent breakfast service,"The food has been very good, with a great variety. We had a very good service from all the waiters at breakfast. Lekhnath, Armando, Sergio and Usmita have been very attentive throughout and it has been a super pleasant experience.",5,2024,09,29
228,"Tended by Sergio, a great Pro.","Sergio attended us at the Hotel bar, everything was easy, he helped us with the language and made us some great lattes adjusting to the Spanish type we requested.
He's a great Pro. Our experience has been totally satisfactory. We will recommend this hotel to our friends and family in Spain.",5,2024,09,20
228,Pretty good but without dental-kit in a 4*hotel.,"The hotel itself is pretty good in both equipment and location. They gave me room 201, on one side. The only thing that does not convince me is the use of carpets throughout the hotel but widespread in northern Europe. 
They have a shop with very reasonable prices to belong to the hotel. 

Unfortunately, on the second day I requested a dental kit and the reception not only didn’t have it but “kindly” indicated that I could go buy it from the supermarket. Unfortunate detail and service in a 4* hotel where the night costs 200€. Huge mistake to be able to rate it better.",3,2024,08,31
228,Hilton a good choice!!,"The service of the excellent restaurant, Pamela very friendly, was Spanish and gave us the time to explain and guide us from places to visit. Christian and Francis also very gentle, the food delicious. The first day they left us fewer towels, but later it was solved. All very well 😊",4,2024,08,01
228,Good service,"Excellent service! Pamela was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a salad cesar, the tomato soup was very delicious. We had an Italian wine that was very good too. I definitely recommend the hotel restaurant hilton garden",5,2024,07,17
228,Pleasant stay in Dublin,"The hotel breakfast is truly wonderful. It is very complete and you can taste the authentic Irish Breakfast. I recommend coming very hungry and with plenty of time to enjoy it.
Many thanks to Javier for his attention, and to Agnes for that wonderful hot chocolate 😉",5,2024,06,10
228,Review,"We like the breakfast, the room and the attention. Thank you Constanza for the care. Neat and everything very clean. The abundant breakfast. The attentive staff. We had a good time at this hotel, I hope it continues like this. It has a very good location, quite central.",5,2024,06,08
228,A room with a view in a quiet area of Dublin,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, the chain says it all, although we had some inconveniences that were all rectifiable. Firstly, I would like to say that the hotel is well located, about 15 minutes from the city centre. The rooms are large and spacious. The reception staff are lovely, especially Valentina, who helped us with everything we needed and did a lot for us, also very attentive Juan.
The wifi works wonderfully both in the rooms and in the hall. This hotel has parking. The complete and varied breakfast buffet.
The only inconvenience we had was that for 2 days we found the room uncleaned, we were surprised but they immediately cleaned it, thinking that it was cleaned every other day, but they didn't tell us that it was their mistake.
It is a good option to choose this hotel if you stay in Dublin and are not in the hustle and bustle of the center.",4,2024,04,30
228,The best arrival in Ireland,"We arrived late from the airport, and very hungry. Everything was closed in the area, and we found that the hotel bar and restaurant were open. Pamela, Marcos and the entire F&B team took great care of us. My wife had a Caesar, my daughter had Fish & Chips and I had a pepperoni pizza with a good Guiness on tap. Everyone is super friendly and has the best vibes. This is how nice it is to arrive in Ireland. Thank you Hilton Garden Inn for welcoming us like this, the best arrival in Ireland",5,2024,04,29
228,Excellent atention,"Pamela and Marcos took great care of us, very cordial and attentive.
The food is perfect and the recommendations are excellent.",5,2024,04,24
228,Excellent attention,"Excellent service, especially in the Restaurant. The attention of Pamela and Francisco was formidable and kind. In addition, the food we ordered, soup of the day, onion rings and cod, the best I have ever tasted. At the hotel everyone has been friendly and fast, when we arrived at check-in and then for any need. The comfortable and heated rooms. As an improvement option it would be to renew the televisions.",5,2024,04,24
228,Excellent hotel in Dublin,"Excellent hotel in the center of Dublin.
Competitive price compared to the Dublin average.
Comfortable, soundproofed and clean rooms.
Large bathroom.
Very rich breakfast and large and comfortable breakfast environment.
We used the restaurant service several times and enjoyed it very much.",5,2024,04,03
228,Easter holidays,"Attention of ten from the guys in the cafeteria and bar service. We went every day and Pamela and Christian took great care of us. I recommend it, they are very friendly and help resolve any questions you may have. Very clean and cozy place",5,2024,03,28
228,Ambiguous impression for € 208/double room/night,"Good location on the River Liffey right next to the EPIC. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to O'Connell Street, and 20 minutes to Temple Bar. There is a direct connection to the airport with the Dublin Express (stops at North Wall Quay, George's Quay, Custom House Quay). 
We had three queen-size double rooms, all on the first floor. 1 room with a view of the Liffey, adequately protected from traffic noise thanks to double windows. 2 rooms at the back, with a view of a wall. The spring mattress is already showing its age, the springs rub against each other and squeak, especially at the edge. Bathroom with a bathtub and a correspondingly high entrance. No hand shower, permanently installed shower, curtain. Overall no longer up to date. Otherwise the room is sufficiently large, almost every socket also has a USB port, so you don't need a GB adapter. When you arrive, there were two small bottles of water in the room. I would have expected them to be refilled daily. Hotel information only available via QR code on the TV. Housekeeping is OK.
Very friendly and quick check-in and check-out. Early check-in was no problem at 1 p.m. Decent breakfast buffet, service mostly attentive. A chef is responsible for the egg dishes as well as replenishing the hot dishes. That's why the omelette station is not manned all the time.
There was some confusion at the bar. According to the hotel information, this is actually open until 1:30 a.m. Due to the lack of visual separation from the restaurant, tables are also used there in the evening depending on how busy it is. At 10 p.m. we were asked to change tables because the table was to be set there - ok. In the bar area, the bill was brought at 11:30 p.m. without being asked, the ""big"" light was turned on at the same time and the carpet was vacuumed - pure eviction. We were now supposed to move to the lobby, which is completely unacceptable. The (early?) end of the day was at the expense of the guests (and sales).",3,2024,03,16
228,"Good hotel, to repeat.","Good hotel, very close to the center. I don't give it a 5 rating because of the beds, they are too hard and the pillows are too soft. The solution is a viscoelastic topper and firmer pillows.
Gym, guest laundry, minibar, tea, coffee and ironing service in the room. Clean room, daily change of towels, good insulation, you can't hear the adjoining rooms.
Great attention and attitude from their workers, a plus in attention and details for Juan at the reception and Javier and Alejandra in the buffet and restaurant. Thank you very much to the three of you. We had dinner at the restaurant two nights and I have to highlight the Seafood chowder, delicious. Good breakfast.
Without a doubt, I would repeat.",4,2024,02,18
228,Magnificent attention from all the staff.,"I traveled with my family to Dublin for four days and the experience was wonderful. At the reception, Demi treated us very kindly, and in the restaurant we really enjoyed Fumz and Tugce, without forgetting Neida's omelettes. Many thanks to the whole team. Good views · Quiet · Good price
Very comfortable bed, good cleaning, change of clothes when necessary. Good soundproofing. The decoration is good, it invites you to BE in the hotel. Magnificent views. I have a disability and need an accessible bathroom, I have not had any problems with the shower, which is the most complicated for me. Magnificent welcome details. The only thing I have missed has been a TV channel in Spanish 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️. Otherwise it has been great to stay in this hotel.
Located close to the center, with the possibility of walking in a short time or by bus, very good location.
We have eaten at the hotel on several occasions. The breakfasts are magnificent, highly recommended, very varied buffet. The food was great as was the dinner.",5,2024,01,07
228,Great stay and best service,"I had dinner with my family in the Hotel restaurant, where Pamela and Alexandra were very attentive to us. Thanks to the fact that they spoke Spanish we felt at home. Congratulations to all the staff.",5,2024,01,07
228,Great stay at the Hilton Garden INN,"Great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn.
My experience has been a 10 from check-in to check-out. Spacious, comfortable and very clean rooms. The whole family traveled for Christmas and the treatment at reception by Gabriel and Faiza was wonderful.
And the Oly's restaurant exceeded our expectations, where we felt very comfortable thanks to Alejandro, Cristian and Francisco.
If I return to Dublin, I will not hesitate to stay here again.",5,2024,01,07
228,The magnificent breakfast chef Neida,"Neida as a breakfast chef in the hotel restaurant, develops magnificently together with her staff of collaborators. The attention is meticulous with all guests, always very intelligent and with a contagious smile. Apart from the fact that she cooks deliciously. I highly recommend. Wishing you success.",5,2023,12,27
228,Good choice,"We stayed over the December long weekend and the experience was fantastic.
The hotel is well located, very close to all places of interest, and has all the amenities we could need.
The breakfast buffet was very complete and pleasant, everything was delicious and very clean. My kids loved that there were waffles to make on the spot.
The staff is super attentive and friendly, from first to last. Traveling with two small children, we were given a very spacious room for our comfort. I have to highlight Álex, Sergio and Fran, three Spanish guys who were part of the staff: polite, efficient and friendly.
The beds are very comfortable, the bathroom is perfectly equipped: amenities, hairdryer, daily change of towels…
I would repeat and recommend it to all my friends.",5,2023,12,11
228,Hilton Hotel deal,"Great and well located hotel, perfect facilities and very comfortable rooms, great breakfast service.

228,Possibly there will not be two without three,"I went last year to this hotel with my partner and this year I returned with my family because this hotel has everything, gym, laundry, good food and excellent service. This year we have also been able to count on a great extra service: Javier. Very friendly and with the language issue it has saved us many potholes, in addition to excellent service. If I return to Dublin again, this will be my hotel.",5,2023,08,17
228,Javier's professional and charming treatment,"Javier took great care of us. He gave us a very good table with a strategic location near the juices (which we greatly appreciated) and he treated us wonderfully. He quickly realized that we were Spanish and the truth is, it helped a lot. Excellent work Javier!",5,2023,08,17
228,Visit to the Hilton Garden Dublin,"The hotel is well located, but the rate is a little high for what the hotel offers, the bathroom is a little small, the rooms are clean and spacious with tasteful decoration, the breakfast is very good and we were served by Javier who was very friendly with us and gave us several recommendations.",4,2023,08,12
228,Visit to return,"Zara at the reception was very friendly and helpful and in the restaurant all the very friendly guys especially Marcos, Héctor and Faviola made me feel at home and made my visit a great experience personally the chicken wings are spectacular",5,2023,08,05
228,No vuelvo,"La limpieza deja mucho que desear.
Vamos, no limpian la habitación.
El trato en la recepción (en general) deja mucho que desear. 
El personal del bar sin embargo es muy atento.
Ahora bien, después de esta experiencia y otras dos en Berlín,  no vuelvo a poner un pie en un Hilton en mi vida.",3,2023,04,09

228,Excelente opción,"Excelente hotel, con la garantía que da una cadena como es el Hilton. El desayuno buffet es bueno, nada exótico. Las habitaciones están excelentes, limpias, buen tamaño.  El hotel cuenta con autoservicio de lavado y secado de ropa, lo cuál nos quedó perfecto para limpiar un poco de ropa al final de nuestro viaje. La ubicación es muy buena, queda justo frente al rio, a 8 min a pie del Trinity College, 16 min de Gaffon St.",5,2023,02,08
228,Estancia en Hilton,"Una estancia muy agradable, habitaciones acogedoras y el servicio de desayuno muy recomendable, todo muy rico y variado.

228,Hotel di buon livello,"Le camere sono spaziose, la colazione è buona. Una sera abbiamo cenato al ristorante, la Irish Ribeye Steak è ottima e non è particolarmente costosa rispetto ai prezzi di Dublino.
La pulizia del bagno potrebbe essere migliore",4,2023,01,13
228,TOLLE LAGE…ABER…,"zuerst zum positiven:

-tolle Lage (ca gute 10 Minuten zum Stadtteil Temple Bar)
-sehr freundlicher Empfang beim Check in und gute Beratung bzgl Fragen zu Dublin
-Zimmer zum Fluss vollkommen in Ordnung und Twinbett mit sehr guten Matratzen 
-Personal sehr freundlich 
-alles sehr sauber

Negativ:

-Badezimmer nicht auf neuesten Stand ( OK 4⭐️)
-was mich aber leider nur 3⭐️geben lässt:
Wir waren von 4/1-7/1 in Zimmer 526 und haben leider unseren Handyplug vergessen…schrieben daraufhin eine freundliche email ( mit der Bitte um Bestätigung) uns diesen zurückzulegen, sodass wir diesen am 9/1 abholen können…bis heute haben wir keine Antwort und ich denke das ist einem Hotel der Hiltongruppe unwürdig! schade…
-2 Wasser in der Minibar gratis ist nett, aber dass man erst die komplette Befüllung ordern muss, erschließt sich mir nicht…das sollte in so einem Hause Standard sein…

Trotzdem würde ich das HILTON GARDEN INN für einen Dublinaufenthalt empfehlen…",3,2023,01,09
228,"Beste Lage, tolles Frühstück - einfach ideal!","Das Hotel ist super. Unbedingt mit Frühstück buchen, denn das ist besser als viele Angebote in der Umgebung. Frisches Omelette, Waffeln, Früchte, glutenfreies Brot... und natürlich alles, was man sonst so kennt. Preis-Leistung ist hier unschlagbar. Die Lage ist top. Airportexpress hält knappe 3 Minuten Fußweg entfernt. In 10 Minuten ist man in Temple bar und im Umkreis ist alles was man braucht. Essen, Trinken, Einkaufen... 
Die Zimmer sind ruhig, der TV hat viele gute Kanäle, eine festgelegte Maximallautstärke, was nervige Nachbarn erspart ;)  und bei Bedarf gibt es Roomservice. Da viele Geschäftsreisende hier sind, ist es ein entspanntes Publikum.
Wir haben über das Reisebüro (Siamar) um ein Zimmer weiter weg vom Fahrstuhl mit Blick auf den Liffey gebeten und das Wunsch-Zimmer auch bekommen - perfekt! Sogar Late-Check-Out war kein Problem...
Und wenn was stört: einfach an der Rezeption bescheid geben, die helfen sehr gern.",5,2022,11,19
228,Great customer service,"Lizette and Francisco very nice hospitable great customer service for being my first time in Ireland so far it’s been great also I have to include Alex chef did an awesome omelet spicy as well like i like it great job guys keep up the good work and thank you again. 

Lizette, y Francisco muy agradable, hospitalario, gran servicio al cliente por ser mi primera vez en Irlanda hasta ahora, ha sido genial, también tengo que incluir al chef Alex, hizo una tortilla picante increíble, así como me gusta, gran trabajo, chicos, sigan con el buen trabajo y gracias de nuevo.",5,2022,10,29
228,Perfektes Hotel für einen Dublin-Besuch,"Das Hotel liegt etwas abseits der Kneipen-Straßen aber sehr zentral im Bezirk Dublin 1. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten kann man in 15 bis 20 Minuten zu Fuß erreichen. Das Hotel liegt direkt am Fluss und mit etwas Glück hat man ein schönes Zimmer mit Blick den Fluss hinauf (Zi. 505 oder 705). Die Zimmer sind ausreichend gross aber nicht riesig und haben eine sehr gut und fein einstellbare Klimaanlage. Es gibt einen kleinen Kühlschrank und einen großen Fernseher. Die Betten sind (Twin Beds) etwas schmal, im Familienzimmer (1 Twin Bed, ein grosses Doppelbett) aber sehr schön gross. Das Personal ist sehr nett, sowohl beim Check-In, beim Frühstück und an der Bar. Das Frühstück ist für Irland herausragend und braucht sich auch im internationalen Vergleich nicht zu verstecken. Besonders lecker ist das frisch nach eigenen Wünschen zubereitete Omelette.",5,2022,08,28
228,Excelente hotel .. limpio y la atención muy buena Excelente,"Llevamos un día de estadía en Hilton graden hotel y nuestra experiencia ha sido Excelente ..  las habitaciones muy cómodas tienes todas las cosas q necesitamos, secadora de pelo guardarropa y el desayuno es muy variado .. 1000 puntos lo recomiendo 100%",5,2022,08,11
228,Ottimo hotel a Dublino,Hotel pulito e allegro. Sono stato al 7 piano in una camera nuova con vista sul fiume molto luminosa. Letto comodo e box doccia doppio molto moderno. Stanza molto silenziosa complimenti per l’insonorizzazione. Colazione buona ma buffet non rifornito costantemente.,5,2022,06,16
228,Un ottimo Garden Inn,"Non è la prima volta che vengo in questo hotel ed è un'ottima possibilità per alloggiare in un Hilton vicino a Temple Bar (ci si va tranquillamente a piedi).
Camera non enorme ma con tutti i comfort. Bagno grande ma con una ventola rumorosissima che per fortuna chiudendo la porta del bagno non si sente e la notte si dorme benissimo.
Ottima la scelta che c'è a colazione, io ho approfittato delle macchine per farmi degli ottimi waffle sul momento.
Ci tornerò presto",4,2022,05,28
228,"Carmelo, muy buen camarero","Carmelo, nos atendió con mucha profesionalidad a la vez que agradable. Nos hizo la estancia muy agradable, viva carmelito! El hotel también fue muy bonito, y las camas muy cómodas, muy buena ubicación.",5,2022,02,28
228,Recomendable,"Bien situado. Personal de restaurante magnífico. Hemos tenido la suerte de encontrarnos varios españoles trabajando en  él, lo cual facilita las cosas por su amabilidad y ganas de agradar. Destacar a ese andaluz , enamorado de la Feria de Sevilla (Carmelo)",5,2022,02,23
228,Hotel centrico y confortable,"Bonito hotel, muy centrico a 10 minutos andando del centro. Con vistas al rio. Habitaciones muy confortables. El desayuno variado y la atención del personal muy buena. Hay camareros españoles y destacar a Carmelo por su simpatia y su profesionalidad. Sin ninguna duda volveriamos a este hotel. Recomendado 100%",5,2022,02,21
228,Nonostante covid,"Nonostante il periodo covid, la struttura ha mantenuto un'atmosfera festiva. Le camere sono ampie e la posizione molto buona. Molto attenti anche alla disinfestazione.  Pochi minuti dal centro dei divertimenti. Personale molto gentile.",5,2022,01,06
228,Decepcionante,"Una pena, bonito lugar con buena ubicación a partir de aquí un personal desorganizado con medidas covid sin sentido haran que recordeis esta estancia…para lo malo claro. Cuatro mesas para cenar colapsan a siete trabajadores que no saben lo que hacen.",2,2021,12,06
228,Ya no es lo que era,"El hotel está bien situado , las habitaciones con vistas son más pequeñas que la interiores , las camas están bien son cómodas y grandes . El servicio de limpieza es cada 2 dias si estáis más de 2 pensar que las toallas que las cambian cada 3 dias. El servicio del hotel va desbordado y cometen equivocaciones continuas piensan en cobrar antes que en servir. Pedimos en el restaurante para 6 personas no me traen mi plato , lo reclamo , pasados mas de 20 min les digo que ya no lo truhan mi familia ya está en la cama. Me dicen que me la llevan a la votación que es gratis por el error me niego a llevármela . Sorpresa me la cobran . Lo corrigen nuevamente . Vamos que me fui sin cenar tras 1 hora y media.
Es la segunda vez que me alojo por periodos no inferiores a 5 dias y creo que la relación de calidad precio ya no es correcta. Está fuera de mercado con la calidad que se espera de un Hilton",4,2021,12,05
228,Buen trato y servicio,"Muy buena atención y servicio en general y en específico a Carmelo que siempre estuvo pendiente de nuestra comodidad en todo momento. Muchas gracias, Totalmente recomendado y con una muy Buena localización.

El único inconveniente que tuvimos fue que no teníamos escobilla en el baño.

Un saludo.",5,2021,12,01
228,Hotel hilton garden inn,"Estuvimos con mi marido dos dias, y realmente un hotel espectacular, limpio, impecable y cómodo. El desayuno buenísimo y la atención del personal excelente!!!

228,5 Giorni a Dublino,Hotel molto curato con camere comode. Colazione abbondante e personale gentile e disponibile. Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Situato proprio sul fiume Liffey molto panoramico e comodo per visitare Dublino. Consigliato.Unica pecca la pulizia della camera avveniva solo su richiesta e comunque dovevano passare almeno due giorni.,5,2021,11,07
228,Sehr gute Lage - gerne wieder,"Das Hotel liegt sehr günstig am Fluss nahe des Custom House. Die Innenstadt und die Sehenswürdigkeiten sind daher leicht zu Fuß erreichbar. Das Hotel bietet ausreichend große und gut ausgestattete, saubere Zimmer. Leider hört man in den Zimmern mit der schönen Sicht auf dem Fluss ziemlich deutlich die Straße, was in der Nacht auch mal störend sein kann. Das Hotel bietet morgens ein reichhaltiges englisches Frühstück an. Im Hotelrestaurant kann man angenehm und recht gut essen und im Hotelshop kann man jederzeit Snacks und Getränke erwerben. Das Hotelpersonal war immer sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.",4,2021,10,25
228,"Gute Lage, perfekt für eine entspannten Stadtaufenthalt.","- tolle Lage (Nähe zum Stadtzentrum, trotzdem ruhig)
- schöner Ausblick vom Zimmer 

- gleiches Frühstück jeden Tag 
- schlechter Kaffee, es sei denn man erfragt sich einen frischen vom Service.
- Zimmer wurde aufgrund von Corona Licht jeden Tag gereinigt ",4,2021,10,22
228,Bien pero falla la limpieza,"La cadena Hilton, por lo visto, ha decidido no limpiar las habitaciones diariamente durante tu estancia. En el momento de la reserva no te avisan, y una vez en el hotel, si lo solicitas, te dicen que se tiene que hacer con 5 días de antelación. En definitiva, nos quedamos 4 noches y ni limpiaron nuestra habitación, ni nos cambiarían las toallas, ni nos repusieron los artículos de aseo. ",3,2021,10,12
228,Un bellissimo hotel con un paio di problemi,"Ottimo hotel, con camere molto ampie e con una colazione splendida per varietà e qualità. Allora perché solo 4 stelle? Per due problemi: il primo la location, dato che la struttura risulta abbastanza vicina al temple bar (circa 20 minuti a piedi), ma in una zona non bellissima, che la sera soprattutto si riempie di gente non molto raccomandabile, e non è un piacere rientrare in hotel.
Il secondo invece la pulizia delle camere, che viene effettuata ogni 5 giorni, e si vuole biancheria pulita, carta igienica e roba simile dobbiamo richiederla alla reception. Alle mie rimostranze mi hanno giustificato la cosa come un emergenza dovuta al Covid, per ridurre i contatti tra staff e clienti, ma al di là che non sono molto d’accordo, questa situazione l’ho trovata un po’ antipatica, e poco consona ad un hotel 4 stelle",4,2021,10,10
228,Super Stadthotel in bester Lage,"Das Hotel ist direkt am Fluss. Sehr schönes, kompetentes und herzliches Willkommen durch Frau Amy am Check In. Sie hat sich sehr um unser Wohl bemüht, alles gut erklärt und alle Wünsche erfüllt (ruhiges Zimmer, zwei Betten). Wir waren jeweils vor und nach unserer Irlandrundreise hier. Beim zweiten Mal hat uns Frau Mariana bedient. Genau so gut. Zimmer sauber, großzügig. Betten bequem. Man fühlt sich so richtig wohl. Frühstück: Gute Auswahl an warmen und kalten Speisen. Alles frisch. Hier ist Frau Agnes besonders hervorzuheben. Sie empfängt und betreut die Gäste mit einer großen Herzlichkeit und Kompetenz. Herzlichen Glückwunsch an die Manager zu den genannten und herausragenden Mitarbeiterinnen! Wir waren rundum zufrieden.",5,2021,10,04
228,Bastante malo,No alojamos 7 días y ya el primer día no nos limpian la habitación cuando pregunto me dicen que por el Covid limpian cada 5 días !!!!! No nos lo dijeron en la reserva ni en el check-in . Al dia siguiente pedí que limpiaran y lo hicieron . Se tiene que reservar para desayunar cuando hemos pagado la estancia con desayuno incluido y cada día tengo problemas porque dicen que está lleno y pretenden que nos levantemos antes cuando estamos de vacaciones . Si pido para desayunar a las 10:00 h me dicen que no cuando el desayuno es de 7:00- 10:30h,2,2021,08,17
228,Il nostro fantastico soggiorno a Dublino,"Tutto benissimo come sempre nelle catene Hilton dove spesso noi facciamo visita essendo Hilton Honors. Locale in una posizione strategica tutto sommato comodo anche per il parcheggio dal momento che si trovano vari posti non proprio di fronte l'hotel ma comunque sempre a meno di 10 minuti a piedi. La camera era spaziosa confortevole grande il giusto con tutti i vari gadget e le comodità tra cui le prese USB per i propri device. Caffè e tea in camera. Bagno con vasca. Pulito e profumato.
La colazione è ottima grazie alla supervisione della bravissima Agnès, Food Manager e del sio staff (elogio alla bravissima cameriera Hanna che corre e pulisce tutto).
Il ristorante Oly adiacente (dove si fa la colazione) è anche ottimo per cenare). Prezzo dell'hotel giusto per ciò che è offerto. ",5,2021,08,09

228,Excelente servicio y ubicación!!Volveremos!!,"Siendo la segunda oportunidad en Dublín este hotel nos pareció excelente!! Si bien esta a unos 10’ de la zona céntrica y de Temple Bar se puede llegar caminando perfectamente! Ubicado frente  al río Liffey las vistas son excelentes! Cercano a Talbot Street donde se encuentran tiendas, supermercado y Pubs tradicionales. Las comodidades y el trato del personal para destacar!! Lo súper recomiendo!!",5,2020,04,27

228,Tranquillo,"Pulito e tranquillo, forse un po' distaccato e non frendly. Posizione tranquilla, non centrale ma vicinissima a Epic. Pochi bar e ristoranti nei paraggi, la sera un Po desolante la zona. Ideale per riposo. Colazione decisamente variata, di qualità, non si può avere di più!",5,2020,02,11
228,Gutes Hotel in angenehmer Lage,"Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, die Zimmer sind top und meist mit sehr schöner Aussicht. Zu Fuß ist alles zu erreichen. Der AirLink Bus hält direkt vor der Tür (12€/Return). 
Einzig das große Frühstück für 16€ finde ich ein wenig zu teuer, auch wenn die Qualität sehr gut ist. 
Ansonsten gerne wieder. ",5,2020,01,29
228,Hotel con buena ubicación,"Fuimos a pasar unos días a Dublin y nos hospedamos en este hotel por su ubicación céntrica y con buena comunicación para ir al aeropuerto con parada enfrente.
Nos dieron una habitación familiar con camas de matrimonio de 135cm que son muy comodas.  La habitación tenia vistas en el rió. El baño era correcto para el tipo de habitación, con su plato de ducha y su grifería con efecto lluvia.
El desayuno era buffet libre y estaba compuesto por la típica comida inglesa, una zona de bollería, fruta, si querías te hacían tortillas o huevos fritos al momento. 
Todo el personal del hotel fue muy amable y nos atendieron con un trato muy bueno.",5,2020,01,27
228,Hotel bien situado,"Durante mi visita a Dublín, me he alojado en este hotel y no me arrepiento de mi elección. La situación es ideal, junto al río, cerca del centro (15 minutos andando) y cerca del tranvía (a 3 minutos a pie). Además el bus al aeropuerto para en el mismo hotel, lo cual ahorra mucho tiempo.
Las habitaciones muy limpias, con decoración simple pero muy cómodas.
El desayuno es bastante variado, y aunque se echa de menos algún zumo natural, el resto está muy bien.
En general por los precios que tiene Dublín en los alojamientos, que suelen ser caros, en este caso tienen buena relación calidad-precio. Si volviese me alojaría de nuevo aquí.",4,2020,01,19
228,Gran atención,"Hotel muy bien ubicado, con una estupenda vista.  Muy buena calidad de sus almuerzos y la atención del staff del hotel es maravillosa.  Justo frente al hotel pasa el Airlink 457/447 que lleva al aeropuerto y también los recorridos de DoDublin.  Muy recomendable",5,2020,01,12
228,Mini vacanza,"La permanenza in questo hotel è stata piacevolissima. La camera, nonostante, fosse lato strada era silenziosa, quindi si riposava bene.
La colazione ottima per il salato, ma peccava un po’ per quanto riguarda il dolce, comunque nell’insieme era buona. Lo consiglio vivamente!",5,2020,01,09
228,Natale 2019,"Ottimo hotel
Vicinissimo al centro anche a ristoranti farmacie e vari negozi
Stanze pulite giornalmente con cambio asciugamani e prodotti cortesia 
Colazione per noi italiani un po piu scarsetta ma nel complesso tutto buono",5,2019,12,28
228,Prima volta a Dublino.. perfetto,"Prima volta a Dublino, splendida città, perfettamente servita (anche se un po cara). Hotel grande dalle camere confortevoli ed ultra silenziose, spaziose, arredi nuovi, pulizia Buona. Situato lungo la sponda del fiume Liffey con tanto di Veliero/museo JEANIE JOHNSTON ormeggiato di fronte. Comodo per il trasferimento da/per Aeroporto con fermata pullman 747/757 difronte l'hotel. Dista a circa 10 Min a piedi dal centro città  (trinity college/ castello dublino/ The spire/ha'penny bridge/The Temple bar/ e tante altre...) accanto l hotel trovate EPIC centro culturale multietnico, e relativa fermata George's dock (Luas station) che in mezz'ora di tram siete alla Guinness Storehouse  (fermata Fatima e 5 Min a piedi), oppure potete visitare il carcere di Kilmainham Goal davvero suggestivo. Prima esperienza dopo tre anni di tentativi, da rifare sicuramente.",4,2019,12,10
228,Sehr guter Aufenthalt,"Sehr gutes Hotel mit guter Lage, fussläufig zur Innenstadt; sehr gutes, komfortables, ruhiges Zimmer mit Blick auf den Fluss; bequeme Betten; ausreichend Kleiderbügel; nettes Personal; Bushaltestelle direkt vor der Tür",4,2019,12,03
228,Muy buen hotel,"Hotel muy bien situado, a unos 15 minutos del centro, con instalaciones modernas y habitaciones espaciosas y con mucha luz. El personal muy amable. No contraté desayuno pues me pareció caro. Repetiría sin dudarlo.
 ",4,2019,10,19
228,Schöner Weekend Trip,"Das Hotel hat sich wirklich gelohnt. Frühstückbuffet war gut und auch der Preis, für welche die es nicht im Hotelzimmer inbegriffen haben. Der Busanschluss ist  Top gleich vor dem Hotel und die Tramhaltestelle ist nur 100m entfernt.",4,2019,10,16
228,Gutes Hotel,"Wir haben 4 Nächte im Hilton Garden Inn verbracht. Die Lage ist gut, wenn man ein paar Minuten Fussmarsch ins Zentrum in Kauf nehmen kann. Für uns war das kein Problem. Unser Zimmer lag im 5. Stock mit Blick auf den Fluss. Klar hört man die Strasse, aber wir konnten dennoch mit geöffnetem Fenster schlafen. Das Zimmer war nur durch eine Zwischentür vom Nachbarzimmer getrennt, wenn dort der Fernseher lief, konnte man das hören. Das Zimmer wurde jeden Tag gut gereinigt, da gab es nichts zu beanstanden. Am letzten Morgen haben wir noch das Frühstück probiert, für 16 Euro p. P. gibt es eine gute Auswahl, vielfältiges Buffet, frische Waffeln.... Nur der Kaffee hat uns nicht so gut geschmeckt. Alles in allem, ein gutes Hotel, welches wir weiterempfehlen würden. ",4,2019,10,12
228,Apuesta segura,Hotel muy bien ubicado a un agradable paseo del centro. O es muy nuevo o han renovado instalaciones muy recientemente. Muy buena atención del personal en todos los equipos con los que interactuamos. Pudimos cenar y nos dimos un homenaje en un ambiente muy relajado (incluso con el hotel lleno como nos dijeron). Realmente buenisima opción cenar en el hotel tranquilos antes de salir a la aventura. Desayuno espectacular!!!,5,2019,10,08
228,Buon hotel a poca distanza dal centro,"Sono stato in questo hotel 5 notti e mi sono trovato molto bene. La posizione non è male trovandosi a una distanza percorribile a piedi per arrivare nella zona viva di Dublino.
L'hotel è semplice ma ben curato, sin dall'ingresso che nelle altre zone comuni.
La mia camera al terzo piane prevede due letti da una piazza e mezza. La stanza è molto silenziosa e si dorme veramente bene (le tende permettono di fare buio completo). Buona scelta di cuscini di consistenza diversa.
Il bagno è relativamente spazioso e presenta una vasca con soffione doccia che funziona bene come il resto dei sanitari.
Internet gratuito è una scheggia. Unica noia il doversi loggare ogni 24 ore.
La colazione presenta un buffet molto abbondante che soddisfa sia chi cerca il dolce che chi cerca il salato.
La palestra è molto piccola ma attrezzata e per correre o fare un po' di pesi va bene (se non ci sono altre persone ad occuparla).
Non è un hotel da WOW ma onestamente non ho trovato il minimo problema ed il prezzo non è eccessivo.",4,2019,10,06
228,"Gute Lage, Schlechter Service","Modernes Stadthotel, guten Betten und Bäder. Leider war das Servicespersonal komplett überfordert (oder unterbesetzt?), sodass unser Zimmer in den drei Tagen unseres Aufenthalts nicht gereinigt wurde. Beim Frühstück lange Warteschlangen (obwohl genügend Tische frei waren, diese aber aufgrund Personalmangel nicht abgeräumt wurden) und Chaos am Frühstücksbuffet.
",3,2019,10,02
228,Ubicación,"Muy buena ubicación, deberían mejorar la relación precio/ servicio ( incluir el desayuno dentro de la tarifa)
Está cerca de la parada de bus q te acercan a todos lados (aeropuerto y estación de tren). Calidad en la atención ",4,2019,09,22
228,Pésima atención y calidad humana,"Lo único bueno a destacar es la ubicación pero dado a que Dublín es una ciudad que se puede recorrer fácilmente caminando no lo recomiendo para nada. Hace un mes tuve un accidente y el seguro me cubrió una noche en este hotel, llegué al mismo en silla de ruedas y notoriamente cansada porq era mi primer día fuera del sanatorio. No fueron capaces de decirme buenas noches ni mucho menos : señorita ahora estamos con usted ( No era mi intención ser atendida antes que nadie ) allí me dejaron esperando y una vez atendida no se ofrecieron a ayudarme con todo mi equipaje en fin, una ordinariez tras otra la cual sin duda marcó mi estadía en el hotel y lo quiero dejar plasmado aquí. Gracias a Dios a la noche siguiente me fui a otro hotel en el cual fui tratada de maravilla y en el cual da gusto estar. Si tienen la oportunidad de elegir no vayan a un Hilton! Hay opciones mejores, en todo aspecto.",1,2019,09,22
228,Estancia muy agradable.,"Está bastante cerca del centro. El personal es encantador y resuelve cualquier dificultad inmediatamente y sin perder la sonrisa. El desayuno es muy bueno, con mucha variedad y calidad de los productos. Lo único que nos pareció un poco caro y con una carta escasa fue el restaurante.",4,2019,08,24
228,Gentlemen`s Trip,"Wir hatten für drei Nächte ein ruhiges Twin Zimmer in einer höheren Etage bestellt und dem wurde nachgekommen (5. Stock, nicht zur Straßenseite). Somit konnten wir mit gekippten Fenster schlafen und es war trotzdem ruhig. Aus den anderen Zimmern haben wir ebenfalls nichts gehört. Das Zimmer ist ausreichend geräumig und gut ausgestattet. Es war top sauber! Die Betten nicht ganz so traumhaft wie die originalen Serenity Beds, aber nicht unbequem. Die Lage aus unserer Sicht perfekt (ca. 10 Minuten Fussmarsch in die Innenstadt). Taxi vom Flughafen 55 EUR inkl. Tip. Das Frühstücksbuffet präsentiert sich vergleichsweise gut sortiert und bietet somit einen guten Start in den Tag. Das Hotel war scheinbar vollständig ausgelastet (Semi Finals G.F.), so dass es frühmorgens im Frühstücksbereich schon etwas hektisch und beengt zuging, man fand aber immer einen Platz und der Nachschub am Buffet ließ nie lange auf sich warten. Das gesamte Personal agierte freundlich und engagiert. Insgesamt empfehlenswert und preislich für Dublin angemessen.",4,2019,08,12
228,"Habitación pequeña, baño grande","El hotel está bien ubicado en la zona financiera de Dublín. Si quieres ir al centro, tampoco está lejos, son unos 15 minutos andando.
La habitación está preparada para viajeros de negocio, incluso cada habitación tiene una plancha con su tabla. Lo malo es que es pequeña para el precio que tiene. El baño por el contrario es enorme. La cama también es grande y cómoda.
El desayuno es de buffet y bastante completo. Incluso tiene una máquina para hacerte tus propios gofres! (Lo cual es peligroso para la dieta :P).",4,2019,07,11
228,Cómodo y acogedor,"Aunque no está en el corazón de Dublín, la localización está muy bien. En 10-15 minutos estás en el centro y lo bueno es que puedes disfrutar de un bonito paseo por el río tras un día de turismo (Dublín es una ciudad pequeña, perfecta para un fin de semana). El desayuno fue genial, muy completo y delicioso. Y la habitación cómoda y limpia.",5,2019,07,10
228,Vacanza a Dublino,"Per terminare la vacanza in Irlanda, abbiamo trascorso gli ultimi due giorni a Dublino. Era già stata metà di viaggio nel 2015, ma ci tenevamo a ritornare e rivivere la sua particolare atmosfera. Oltre ai monumenti ricchi di storia, la zona di Temple Bar è forse unica nel suo genere.",4,2019,06,21
228,Excelente. Nada para criticar,"Muy buen hotel. Ubicado al lado del museo de la emigracion, frente al rio. La xona es muy tranquila y segura. La calidad del descanso es excelente como lo son las instalaciones; limpio, moderno y muy agradable. El desayuno...excelente con productos de buena calidad y variado. No tengo nada para criticar. Solo observar q si tienes problemas de movilidad o te gusta alojarte en pleno centro de la ciudad este no es tu hotel ya q esta a unos 10-15 minutos de caminata de temple bar. Para nosotros no fue ningun problema; dublin es una ciudad pequeña y se puede recorrer a pie. El airlink 757 y 747 q te lleva al aeropuerto para en la puerta del hotel. Lo recomiendo.",5,2019,06,15
228,Caro per un 3 stelle. Ma ottimo,"Devo dire che dopo aver letto qualche recensione negativa ero molto preoccupato.  Ma ho trovato un albergo molto pulito e senza alcuna sbavatura a parte il prezzo altino, ma coerente con la.media dei costi della vita a Dublino. 
Sono rimasto 5 notti e la prima colazione é sempre stata assolutamente fantastica.
Anche i dolci erano presenti nella giusta quantità. Otttimo",5,2019,06,13
228,Excelente ,"Fui con mi Sra. Excelente hotel. Nuevo, limpio, bien atendido. Lo mejor, el desayuno, EXCELENTE.!! Queda muy bien para ir y volver al aeropuerto con el AIR Link 747 y 757.
Esta a 10 min caminando del centro. Frente al río. Zona silenciosa y tranquila. Realmente si vuelvo a Dublin volvería a alojarme aca",4,2019,06,06
228,Kurztrip Dublin,"Wunderschöner Kurzausflug, ideales Hotel für Sightseeing Dublin, tolle Zimmer mit Ausblick, etwas überteuert, klasse Service und prima Frühstücksbüffet, ideale Anbindung zur Innenstadt, Hafen und Flughafen mit Bushaltestelle vorm Haus , Busstop auch für Hop on- Hop off 
Gerne wieder 👍",4,2019,06,05
228,Muy buena ubicacion,"Fente al río Liffey, permite llegar caminando hacia Fleet Street donde se encuentran los famosos bares de la ciudad. También a pie se puede llegar rapidamente a  Trinity College y disfrutar de su maravillosa biblioteca con el libro de Kells.
Hotel con limpieza excelente, camas cómodas, desayuno muy completo. 
En cuanto a precio- calidad, lo note algo caro.",5,2019,06,01
228,Klasse Hotel,"Das Hotel ist für den Preis super. Der Service ist top das Personal sehr nett, die Zimmer sind sauber und das Frühstück ist lecker.
Obwohl sich das Hotel zur Zeit meines Besuches im Umbau fand, wurde der Aufenthalt nicht negativ beeinträchtigt. Die Lage eignet sich super für einen Städtetrip.",5,2019,05,25
228,"Betten etwas klein, sonst ok!","Die Lage war, auch wenn an einer stärker befahrenen Strasse, sehr gut. Das Zentrum und damit die wichtigsten Attraktionen können zu Fuß erreicht werden. Direkt daneben liegt das EPIC-Museum. 
Wir hatten ein Doppelzimmer, dafür waren die Betten aber recht klein!",4,2019,05,10
228,Schönes Hotel,"Sehr schönes Hotel.
Die Lage ist zum Sightseeing zu Fuss nicht optimal.
Das Personal ist überaus hilfreich und freundlich!
Die Zimmerausstattung war überdurchschnittlich gut für diesen Preis.
Das Frühstück bietet für jeden Geschmack etwas.",4,2019,05,05
228,Super Unterkunft.,"Ich kann diese Unterkunft nur empfehlen. Die Lage ist super, die Ausstattung ist super. Das Frühstück bietet alles was man benötigt und ist frisch. Die Mitarbeiter sind sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Ein Parkhaus ist direkt um die Ecke.
Einziger „Minuspunkt“ ist allerdings der doch relativ hohe Preis. ",5,2019,05,02
228,Recomendado!,"Nos quedamos en este hotel hace tres días ,dos noches. Habitaciones confortables, espaciosas con un buen baño. Desayuno muy completo. La atención correcta y muy buena ubicación. Totalmente recomendable para estadía o una noche en Dublin.",4,2019,04,30
228,Un hotel cómodo y confortable,"Un hotel cómodo y confortable con un personal atento. Ubicado a quince minutos del centro de Dublín. Las habitaciones son correctas, con tetera, plancha y secador de pelo. Cerca de las paradas de autobús y del museo de la inmigración",4,2019,04,21
228,Sehr schöner Wochenendaufenthalt,"Wir waren mit einem befreundeten Paar für ein Wochenende in Dublin und haben den Aufenthalt im Hilton Garden Inn Dublin sehr genossen. Das Hotel kann ich weiterempfehlen. Saubere, helle Zimmer mit schönem Blick auf die Skyline. Schallisolierte Fenster, so dass man vom Straßenlärm fast nichts mitbekommt. Sehr gutes Frühstück.",4,2019,04,15
228,Sotto le aspettative ,"L’hotel è in una buona posizione, lo staff è cordiale e anche il livello di pulizia era buono. Però considerata cifra pagata e il nome dell’hotel l’aspettativa era più alta. Il bagno è old stile, e gli arredi migliorabili. ",2,2019,02,17
228,Genial,"Todo fantástico ! Muy cerca del centro !! Perfecto !! Justo frente al río con unas buenas vistas . Muy cerca de centro de la ciudad y a mano de todo. Volvería a repetir en este hotel seguro !!!! Muy limpio , e insonorizado , lo único que a la tele le faltaba el canal de televisión española internacional ",5,2019,01,07
228,Rundum zufrieden!,"Für mich hat dieses Hotel definitiv mehr als 3 Sterne verdient.

Die vier Tage, die ich beruflich in Dublin war bot mir das Hilton mit einem klasse Zimmer, einem tollen Frühstück und einem ausreichenden Gym für abendliche, sportliche Aktivitäten alles was ich brauchte. Gerne wieder!",5,2018,12,14
228,"Top Lage, Preis/Leistung stimmt","Wir waren kürzlich für eine Woche in Dublin im Hilton.
Check Inn war sehr freundlich, der Kontaktbersuch über Facebook vorab mit Wunsch nach Zimmer mit Doppelbett war wohl nicht so erfolgreich (Dame an der Rezeption wusste nichts davon) gab dann aber gleich ungefragt ein kleines Upgrade dafür. Top gelöst!
Das Perosnal generell sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit! Sauberkeit war ok, Frühstück in der 3Sterne-Klasse hervorragend. Irish, Brot Wurst Käse (kleine Auswahl aber gut), Omlette Station! Und Waffeln zum selber backen. 
Highlight ist die LAGE!!
Airlink(747 und 757) sowie Hop on und Hop off halten direkt am Hotel, Straßenbahn ist 5Min zu Fuß und eigentlich sind Temple Bar und City Center ebenfalls zu Fuß zu erreichen.
Top: WLAN funktioniert und das in guter Qualität (Empfang top, Geschwindigkeit sogar für Netflix und Co ausreichend gut, kostenfrei).
Einzig das Restaurant Olys konnte uns leider nicht überzeugen, da empfehle ich eher auswärts zu essen. 
Wer die Stadt erkunden will, ein gutes Zimmer ohne chichi in guter Lage sucht ist hier richtig!",4,2018,11,25
228,Tolles Businesshotel am Liffey,"Ein modernes Garden Inn, sauber, schick, mit gutem wlan, dirket am neuen Emigration Museum und am Liffey-Fluss. Gutes Frühstück, nur der Fitnessraum könnte etwas unfangreicher ausfallen.

Flughafenbus hält vor der Tür.

Gern wieder!",4,2018,11,07
228,Excellent Location and helpful staff,"Top location und alle Dublin Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuss erreichbar.  Sehr sauber, neu, schnelles internet, bequeme Betten und sehr hilfreiches Personal an der Rezeption das sich immer Zeit nimmt.  Das Restaurant ist gar nicht mal schlecht und immer gut besucht,  am Frühstücksbuffet ist allerdings schon manchmal zu viel los.  Ich komme gerne wieder wenn ich in Dublin bin.",5,2018,11,04
228,Excelente atención,"Las habitacion amplia,  camas muy comodas. A pesar de estar frente a una calle muy concurrida no se escuchan los ruidos y es muy tranquilo. El barrio y alrededores son muy seguros para salir de noche.
El personal de recepción muy atentos.",5,2018,10,15
228,Lo mejor para estar en Dublin.,"A pasos de todos lados, sobre todo del museo de la Migración. excelente desayuno y el bar. Muy buena cenas. Hay que pedir habitaciones en pisos altos ya que se escuchan los ruidos de la calle. Algunos empleados tienen mala cara y nadie habla español. lo mejor la recepcionista brasilera.",5,2018,09,29
228,Deludente,"Premesso che la camera era spaziosa e pulita, sono rimasta profondamente delusa da questa esperienza all'Hilton. Mi aspettavo molto da questa catena di fama internazionale. Soprattutto mi aspettavo un servizio all'altezza dei 190€ per notte. 
Iniziamo con l'aspetto peggiore, la vista dalla camera: un pezzo di muro dell'edificio accanto e robe accatastate per terra, bidoni/cassoni della spazzatura, compreso uno di quelli da compattatore.
Passiamo alla camera: appena sopra la porta di accesso, nel soffitto, c'è un buco, protetto da una specie di rete, per l'ispezione negli impianti con all'interno una sorta di centralina con luce verde: questa luce nella notte illumina la camera, ci si può spostare tranquillamente senza accendere la luce. Molto fastidioso!
In camera c'è un tavolino: peccato che ci sia solo una sedia per la scrivania (e una poltrona); mettere un'altra sedia?
Il letto ha in dotazione due cuscini: peccato che siano identici (perfino nelle guesthouse abbiamo trovato la scelta dei cuscini); per 190€/notte me lo aspetto!!!
Il bagno è sprovvisto di ""stufetta"": farsi la doccia era abbastanza freddo; come sopra, nelle guesthouse c'era la possibilità di scaldare il bagno, sempre per la cifra pagata, e ricordo che siamo all'HIlton, non si può installare qualcosa per riscaldare l'ambiente?
Il bagno manca completamente di piccoli 'accessori' assolutamente non necessari e che, sono certa, se li avessi richiesti sarebbero stati forniti, ma a mio parere una catena di questo tenore li deve mettere a disposizione, mi riferisco a: cotton fioc, cuffia per la doccia, specchietto ""ingranditore"", contenitore porta spazzolini.",1,2018,09,21
228,Estandar de la marca,"Es un hotel que aunque no tiene la mejor ubicacion esta relativamente cerca a todo lo que busca un turista en esta ciudad encantadora.
Con el estandard de la marca en cuanto a instalaciones no se caracteriza por una buena atencion especialmente en la recepcion. 
Los hoteles deberian tener al menos en la recepcion personal de la ciudad o al menos del pais capaces de dar una bienvenida a lo ¨Local¨.Nos atendió una recepcionista de un pais balcanico con una actitud muy diferente a los locales que conocimos despues.
El restaurante merece un comentario aparte:
Pedimos dos sandwiches de carne.Nos trajeron un pan viejo y duro y dos minusculas tiras de algo parecido a carne de vaca,Reclamamos por la mala calidad y nos reemplazaron el pan por un pan igual de viejo pero sin tostar.No lo pudimos comer.
La mesera ( española) avergonzada nos manifesto que igual debian cobrarlos porque lo habiamos probado.",2,2018,09,02
228,schlecht klimatisierte Zimmer,"aufgrund der Tatsache, dass es sich um vollklimatisierte Zimmer handelt und keine Möglichkeit besteht, Frischluft ins Zimmer zuzuführen, ist das Raumklima bei Tag und insbesonders bei Nacht mit zunehmender Dauer unangenehm. Zusätzlich ist die Qualität des Frühstückpersonals stark verbesserungswürdig - in Summe enttäuschend!",2,2018,07,30
228,Gutes Stadthotel,"Am Anfang einer Irlandrundreise haben wir 2 Nächte in diesem Hotel verbracht. 

Zimmer okay, Personal sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. 
Das Frühstück war wirklich sehr gut.
Auch die Bar am Abend ist zu empfehlen. Dort gab es einen der besten Hamburger der Reise und Personal wieder sehr freundlich. 
Es gibt eine Parkgarage um die Ecke, für die man nur die Hälfte des Tagessatzes zahlen muss (€18), wenn man im Hilton nächtigt.

Alles in Gehweite. 
Es gibt auch etliche sehr nette Lokale gleich um das Hotel herum. 2x um die Ecke ist man schon bei der Straßenbahnstation. 

Alles in Allem ein Hilton Garden Inn, wie man es erwarten würde, inklusive absoluter Stadtnähe und freundlichem Person + gutem Frühstück und netter Bar. ",5,2018,07,26
228,Top Lage - alles zu Fuß erreichbar,"Zum Zeitpunkt unseres Aufenthaltes wurde gerade umgebaut. Da wir aber für einen Städtetrip keinen langen Zimmer-Aufenthalt geplant hatten, störte dies uns nicht. Dir Arbeiten begannen morgens um 8 Uhr, da waren wir bereits im Bad oder am Weg zum Frühstück. Das Buffet hat gesundes, deftiges aber auch süßes geboten. Besonders toll: Frische Omeletts und Waffeln.
Die Zimmer waren sauber, Duschgel bitte selber mitbringen, das Personal sehr freundlich. Direkt vor dem Hotel gibt es eine Hop-On-Hop-Off Haltestelle. Man konnte auch alles zu Fuß erledigen. Es sind 12 Minuten zum Zentrum (O'Connell Monument).",4,2018,06,04
228,Hilton...non ci siamo!!!,"Sono cliente Hilton da anni e penso che questo sia l'hotel più brutto che abbia visitato! La camera nostra tripla era piccolissima con un bagno piccolo difficilmente vivibile in 3 persone tanto che abbiamo chiesto un terzo letto e avrebbero provato anche a metterlo dentro ma non so proprio come sarebbero riusciti a farlo! reception parlante soltanto la lingua inglese che per un 4 stelle in Europa non è sicuramente degno delle stelle che ha ricevuto! La colazione costa €14 al giorno a persona e per il prezzo che costa potrebbe sicuramente dare di più quasi inesistenti i dolci solo piccoli croissant e niente altro ottimo invece  il salato!
Di positivo ha la posizione che quella per il quale oltre al nome Hilton abbiamo scelto questo albergo a 15 minuti dal centro con la fermata degli autobus proprio davanti all'hotel. In merito a questo particolare vi consiglio di arrivare col taxi o perlomeno di prenderlo per rientrare in Italia in quanto gli autobus se pieni non si fermano alla fermata e noi avremmo rischiato di perdere l'aereo Se non avessimo rinunciato al nostro biglietto di rientro dell'autobus e prendere il taxi al semplice costo di €20! Dublino comunque è una splendida città e fa dimenticare anche questi particolari anche se per €950 per tre notti in tre persone uno si aspetta un servizio migliore soprattutto come cliente Hilton",3,2018,05,27
228,Tranquillo e vicino al centro,"Abbiamo soggiornato due notti arrivando con bus da Galway (fermata O' Connell bridge) e abbiamo fatto una buona scelta, in quanto l'hotel è molto silenzioso, lontano dal caos delle serate di temple bar, e quindi assicura un buon riposo. Camera grande, pulita con bollitore caffe e the, cassaforte e frigo bar. Appena fuori dal centro ma raggiungibile a piedi in un quarto d'ora di piacevole passeggiata. Non abbiamo fatto la colazione ma abbiamo cenato una sera. Buona cucina in ambiente tranquillo con personale gentile. Area computer e stampante al piano terra e palestra.
Fermata bus aeroporto davanti all'hotel.
L'unica pecca è stata che ci hanno rifatto la camera (bagno e asciugamani compresi) ma non il letto.... poco importa però non ci era mai capitato,
Comunque hotel consigliato.",4,2018,05,09
228,Ottima colazione e belle camere,"L’Hotel è un un’ottima posizione. Dista poco dall’aeroporto ed è ben collegato. La camera è spaziosa e l’arredamento ben curato. In camera c’era il phon, di quelli buoni, non da viaggio e persino l’asse e il ferro da stiro. Il personale è cortese e disponibile. Nella Hall ci sono distributori automatici; c’è un punto vendita per i biglietti delle attrazioni. La colazione è ricca: si può fare l’Irish Breakfast, preparare un waffel oppure mangiare una omelette preparata al momento.  Il settore dei dolci lascia un po’ a desiderare. La colazione costa 14 euro a persona: un prezzo alto, ma dopo questa colaZione si cena direttamente. L’hotel dovrebbe migliorare  la dotazione dei saponi nelle camere e del kit per la cura del corpo e arricchire la colazione dato che si fa pagare non poco. Inoltre spesso i prodotti a colazione finivano senza che venissero sostituiti.",4,2018,05,01
228,Hotel muy recomendable y bien situado,"Pasamos un fin de semana en pareja en este hotel. La situación es fantástica. Fuimos andando a todas nuestras visitas y cenas. El precio para la situación fue muy razonable. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y cómodas con internet gratuito que funciona muy bien. La nuestra estaba recién reformada. Limpias y con un baño correcto. El desayuno estaba muy bien, con variedad y calidad. En general pasamos un fin se semana estupendo. Lo único a tener en cuenta es que están reformando y tiene andamios por toda la fachada así que en cualquier momento puede pasar alguien por delante de tu ventana. Espero que acaben pronto las obras.",5,2018,04,25
228,"BUENA SITUACION, MUY CERCA DE TODO","Buen Hotel, está muy cerca de todo lo turístico de Dublín. Parada del bus del aeropuerto en la misma puerta. Amabilidad de los empleados. Limpieza. El hotel lo están reformando, nos dieron una habitación de las nuevas, todo muy bonito, camas cómodas, buenos servicios, no falta ningún detalle y encima nos ha cogido un tiempo magnifico para poder disfrutar de la ciudad.",5,2018,04,24
228,derzeit nicht zu empfehlen,"Hotel eingerüstet, tagsüber bauarbeiten, klimaanlage noch nicht funktionstüchtig, doppelzimmer gebucht: handtücher und duschgel nur für eine person bereitgestellt und letzteres ist auch nicht aufgefüllt worden",2,2018,04,23
228,Recomendable!!!!,"Habitación totalmente renovada, amplia, buena ubicacion
Muy buena conexión con el aeropuerto a través de Airbuslink
De fácil acceso andando a todos los sitios, cerca cel río 
Aunque seguían de obras no tuvimos molestias por ello",4,2018,04,12
228,"Nuevo, cómodo y perfectamente ubicado","Totalmente renovado. Habitaciones casi a estrenar. Modernas y amplias habitaciones. Súper bien situado, parada del bus al aeropuerto en la misma puerta. Personal correctisimo. Muy recomendable. Nada q ver con los típicos hoteles europeos",4,2018,04,12
228,Empfehlenswertes Hotel für Kurztrip,"Wir sind 4 Mädels die ein Wochenende in Dublin verbracht haben. 
Der Shuttlebus Airlink hält direkt vor der Tür.  Wir hatten ein Zimmer zu viert mit 2 Queen Betten. Wir fanden es vollkommen ausreichend. 
Die Betten sind bequem, das Badezimmer hatte eine Wanne keine Dusche. 
Was wir besonders erwähnenswert finden, ist das es für Handys direkt neben den Betten USB Buchsen gibt.
Also man kann auch ohne Reisestecker hinfahren, wenn man Geräte hat, die per USB geladen werden können. Das Personal ist freundlich und hilfsbereit. 
Bis nach Templebar sind es ca 15 Gehminuten. 
Wir waren zufrieden und können das Hotel weiterempfehlen. ",5,2018,04,07
228,"Hotel in buona posizione, pulito , consigliato","La struttura veramente ottima, pulizia quasi perfetta (teiera e quadri in camera erano un po'impolverati) personale gentile. La struttura è in ristrutturazione per aggiungere ad ogni camera un condizionatore, ma attualmente troverete dei termosifoni elettrici che riscaldano tantissimo.
Colazione un po'costosa 14€ a persona, ma davvero molto molto ricca. Forse consiglierei alla struttura di aggiungere qualcosa in più di dolce come torte ad esempio e cappuccini che mancano completamente, per noi italiani, ma nel complesso molto buona, c'è davvero tantissimo dal salato, ai waffle fai da te. 
La posizione è buona, attaccato al Museo EPIC ed a dieci minuti a piedi dalla zona Temple Bar. ",4,2018,04,03
228,Non all’altezza ,Mi dispiace ma non proprio all’altezza del nome che porta... struttura in ristrutturazione con poca cura nei dettagli e soprattutto uno sgradevole odore che risaliva dal bagno... per non parlare del prezzo esagerato (ma che ci può anche stare durante San Patrizio) che non comprendeva nemmeno la colazione. Deluso,2,2018,03,17
228,Tolles Hotel auch wenn zur Zeit gebaut wird.,"Das einzige was ich indirekt „negativ“ fand ist das zur Zeit dort das Hotel erweitert/gebaut wird. Das ganze Gebäude ist von Baugerüsten umgeben und innen sind teilweise hier und da kleine Baustellen zu sehen. Eigentlich nicht schlimm denn man hat zumindest von unserem Zimmer nichts gehört, dennoch haette man das erwähnen können,denn wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Ausblick auf den Liffey gebucht und es war ein halbes Gerüst davor.

Naja nun zu den positiven Dingen, sonst waren die Mitarbeiter, freundlich, hilfsbereit und zuvorkommend. Das Frühstück gibt auch alles her was man so zum Frühstücken haben möchte; Toast, Croissants, verschiedene Säfte, Tee, Kaffee, Kakao, Milch etc. , englisches Frühstück, Eier wie man sie gerne hätte, Obst, Gemüse usw. Lohnt sich definitiv! Man kommt von dort zu Fuß ca.10-15 min in die Stadt, ansonsten auch gute Anbindungen mit dem Bus! 
Die Einrichtung selbst ist sauber und nicht heruntergekommen! Es hat einen Fitnessraum und was super ist; zwei Pc‘s mit Internet und Druckeranschluß umsonst für die Gäste!! Wifi ist auch kostenlos im ganzen Hotel.
CostaCoffee ist auch vorhanden.
Es ist für den Preis auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen ☺️",4,2018,03,17
228,In ottima posizione per visitare Dublino.,"Ho soggiornato 3 notti in questo Hotel con la mia famiglia. Si trova sul fiume Liffey, vicinissimo al museo EPIC in posizione tranquilla. Con una piacevole passeggiata di 15 minuti lungo il fiume si arriva in Temple Bar oppure in O'Connel Street.

La camera da 3 non era spaziosissima a dire il vero, comunque confortevole; pulita e con letti comodi.
La colazione ottima, a buffet, con ampia scelta tra dolce e salato. Dall'Irish breakfast ai waffel preparati al momento passando per salumi e formaggi, pane fresco da tostare a piacimento, brioches, marmellate, yogurt e frutta. Imperdibile per cominciare bene la giornata! 

Plus: Fermata della navetta da/per aeroporto di Dublino sul marciapiede davanti all'Hotel. Tram Luas a 200 metri. Davvero comodo. Personale alla reception disponibile e gentile (abbiamo fatto il check-in a mezzanotte). Servizio di deposito bagagli. 

Unica critica: insufficienti i prodotti da bagno, la saponetta per tre giorni è rimasta la stessa. Non grave ovviamente, però da migliorare.

",4,2018,02,20
228,Pessimo!!,"Assolutamente un Hilton non all’altezza del proprio nome. Ho prenotato una family (siamo in tre) ma è grande quanto una doppia per cui impossibile muoversi in tre, è calda da morire, nonostante abbia chiuso il termosifone e aperto la finestra, e sporca. Stasera ho dovuto chiamare la concierge per chiedere la pulizia del bagno!! Il personale è carino ed è l’unica nota positiva. Credo che esistano alternative migliori a questo prezzo...",1,2018,02,15
228,Muy buen lugar,"El hotel es bastante acogedor, las habitaciones cómodas y todo muy limpio. La atención del personal es muy buena, particularmente tuve un problema con mi muela y las chicas de recepción me ayudaron para contactar dentistas, seguro, etc. Está bastante bien ubicado, a unas pocas cuadras se encuentra la zona The Temple y resto de atracciones. Es una caminata muy linda al lado del río Liffey, imposible perderse caminar hacia el Convention Centre al atardecer/nochecita: las luces en el río son espectaculares!",4,2018,02,07
228,Ein guter Ausgangspunkt für eine Städtetour,"Das Hilton Garden Inn Dublin Custom House ist ein guter Ausgangspunkt für eine Städtetour. Es ist verkehrsgünstig gelegen und nicht weit vom Temple Bar District entfernt (15 - 20 Minuten Fußweg). Eine Bushaltestelle ist direkt vor der Tür. Das Hotel ist relativ neu (wird gerade um 89 weitere Zimmer erweitert), ist sehr sauber und hat einen freundlichen Service. Wir kommen gerne für die nächste Wochenendreise wieder.",5,2018,01,29
228,Perfektes Hotel durch zentrale Verkehrslage,"Das Hilton Garden Inn Custom House in Dublin eignet sich durch seine zentrale Verkehrslage ausgezeichnet für Touristen. Mit den Airlink Bussen der Linien 747 und 757 gelangt man direkt vom Flughafen innerhalb von weniger als 30 Minuten vor die Haustür des Hotels. Ebenso einfach gestaltet sich dann natürlich auch die Abreise. Die Busse verkehren in beiden Richtungen in Intervallen von maximal 30 Minuten, oft auch kürzer. Dies macht eine Planung wirklich sehr unkompliziert. An der selben Haltestelle direkt vor dem Hotel bleiben auch zahlreiche andere Buslinien stehen, die einen an die unterschiedlichsten Ecken der Stadt bringen. In Gehdistanz von etwa 5 Minuten befindet sich hinter dem Hotel außerdem eine der Linien des LUAS (rote Linie), mit welcher man ebenfalls problemlos Dublin erkunden kann.

Die Hotelangestellten waren alle sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Gepäckaufbewahrung am Abreisetag nach dem Check-Out  möglich (und dann bequem mit den Airlink Bussen zum Flughafen). Das Frühstücksbuffet ist täglich von 07:00 bis 10:00 Uhr geöffnet; man sollte vor dem Betreten am Empfang seine Zimmernummer bekannt geben. Das Buffet umfasst sowohl kalte als auch warme Speisen, die Auswahl ist für ein 4-Sterne-Haus nicht luxuriös, aber dennoch vielseitig. Omelettes werden auf Wunsch frisch zubereitet (ohne Aufpreis) und schmecken einfach fantastisch.

Die Größe unseres Doppelzimmers war für unseren 4-tägigen Aufenthalt vollkommen ausreichend. Wir hatten über BA-Holidays ein Zimmer mit King-Size-Bed gebucht, da wir keine Einzelmatratzen mögen. Das Zimmer war modern eingerichtet und in angenehmen Farbtönen gehalten. Zur Ausstattung gehörten auch ein Zimmersafe sowie ein Wasserkocher mit Tee, Kaffee, Milch und Zucker. Diese Produkte sowie auch diverse Hygieneprodukte im Badezimmer wurden täglich bereit gestellt. Unser Badezimmer verfügte über eine Wanne mit einem vernünftig breiten und langen (und sauberen!) Duschvorhang, somit gab es nach dem Duschen nicht die übliche, lästige Überschwemmung im Bad. Klimaanlage (die auch als Heizung funktionierte) und WiFi funktionierten ebenfalls einwandfrei. Positiv war außerdem, dass das Hotel unseren Wunsch nach einem ruhigen Zimmer, den wir bereits kurz nach der Buchung geäußert hatten, berücksichtigte und unser Fenster daher auf eine Seitenstraße zeigte. Die Zimmer, die sich an der Frontseite des Hotels befinden, bieten wahrscheinlich einen netten Ausblick auf die Liffey, allerdings ist die Straße auch recht stark befahren. Von den Umbauarbeiten, die gerade im und am Hotel stattfinden, haben wir an keinem der 4 Tage etwas mitbekommen, allerdings fiel unser Aufenthalt auch auf ein Wochenende und einen Feiertag.
Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt im Hilton Garden Inn Custom House sehr genossen, würden jederzeit wieder buchen und können das Hotel ohne Einschränkungen weiterempfehlen.

Tipps: Mit der Visitor Leap Card, die man direkt am Flughafen in dem kleinen Supermarkt/Tabakgeschäft kaufen kann, fährt man völlig unkompliziert und flexibel mit Dublins öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln. Die Leap Card gilt auch bis relativ weit ins  Umland (ohne Aufpreis bis ans Ende der DART-Linien). Die Visitor Leap Card kann außerdem auch gleich für die Fahrt mit den Airlink Bussen 747 und 757 verwendet werden. Bei Bedarf bucht man einfach weiteres Guthaben auf (ebenfalls im Supermarkt oder in Trafiken möglich).",5,2018,01,18
228,"Excelente ubicación, habitaciones y servicio salvo...","El hotel esta siendo renovado. hay carteles por toda la instalación que explica que podría haber ruidos. Nunca senti ruidos, me toco la Habitación #120 con una excelente vista, la cama muy comoda y moderna, tienen muchos puertos USB para cargar diferentes dispositivos, reloj despertador, lo único malo es que siendo GOLD tengo el desayuno incluido y cuando fui al restaurante me dijo que no lo tenía que debia abonarlo, nisiquiera busco ni consulto si podría ser un error me dio una explicación poco creible que era que el desayuno lo tenía desde el segundo día de alojamiento, tiene una cafetería costa para pedir y abonar lo que consumes, como no le crei su comentario busque datos de la reserva donde aparecía que sí tenía incluido el desayuno, le dije al sr. recepcionista del restaurante y me dijo que sí lo tenía, la poca amabilidad y el poco interés por resolver la situación me ha caido muy mal, el hotel me ha llamado después para pedirme disculpas y que no volverá a ocurrir, pero el mal momento me lo hicieron pasar ese día.",4,2017,12,26

Excelentes vistas sobre el rio.",5,2017,12,12
228,Ich hätte mehr erwartet. Wird gerade umgebaut,"Das Hotel ist von der Lage her sehr gut. Man kann vieles zu Fuss erreichen zum Beispiel den Temple Bar district. Die Zimmer sind relativ klein. Großes bequemes Bett. Frühstück war ok, hätte ich aber nicht nochmal gebucht.
Jetzt das nicht so tolle :-)
Dusche geht mir mit 1.85 cm gerade bis zu den Schultern. Duschkopf wackelt an der Wand. Shampoo wurde nicht aufgefüllt, ich stand abends ohne Shampoo in der Dusche (Cent artikel) Die Abdrücke meiner Zahnbürste wurden auch im laufe mehrerer Tage nicht weggewischt. Boden im Bad wurde trotz fusseln weder gesaugt, noch gewischt. Schade weil gerade Sauberkeit kein Sterne Problem sein sollte.
Zudem kam Von früh bis spät Baulärm und Staub dazu, sowie der rege Verkehr vor dem Hotel.",3,2017,11,27
228,Eccellente esperienza al centro di Dublino!,"ottima soluzione nel centro di Dublino, personale super disponibile, anche italiano, camera moderna, letto comodissimo, pulizia top, bagno con doccia molto confortevole. colazione da 5 stelle, iper abbondante sia salata che dolce. il bar della reception con una ottima scelta di birre alla spina a tutte le ore ed a prezzi convenientissimi. Accanto ai letti oltre alla tipica presa della corrente c'è anche un attacco per cavo USB... quindi non è servito l'adattatore per caricare il telefono. Unica pecca la mancanza del frigobar in camera e della totale assenza di un armadio, se si alloggia per più di tre giorni problematico non disfare le valige. la scelta dei canali televisivi è limitata al digitale terrestre per cui canali internazionali pochi, peccato....",4,2017,11,08
228,Gutes Mittelklassehotel,"Das Hotel ist gut gelegen, das Temple Bar-Viertel ist problemlos zu Fuss erreichbar.

Die Zimmer sind nicht besonders gross aber ausreichend. Die Sauberkeit ist OK, könnte allerdings etwas besser sein. Gerade die Zimmer die auf die Flussseite rausgehen sind wegen des Verkehrslärms nicht gerade ruhig.

Aufgrund der Lage ist das Hotel sicher zu empfehlen, auch wenn es nicht zu 100% das erfüllt, was man von einem Hilton erwartet.",3,2017,11,01
228,Ottimo soggiorno ,"Siamo stati in hotel per una vacanza; il bus navetta dell'aeroporto ferma accanto all'albergo che si trova praticamente in centro città. 
La stanza è ben pulita e arredata con gusto. 
L'albergo offre diversi servizi tra cui SpA, WiFi gratuito e bar dove poter sostare se non si vuole uscire. 
Il personale è molto disponibile ed attento.
Pagato il giusto per le comodità sopra indicate.
I locali sono completamente accessibili.
Lo consiglio.",5,2017,11,01
228,Ubicación conveniente y calidad,"Calidad esperable de un Hilton a un precio algo inferior. El lugar está siempre limpio y aseado y se cuidan los detalles, desde reponer y recolocar los sobre de té y café hasta el diseño de la cortina del baño.",4,2017,09,08
228,.......,"Prenotato con colazione inclusa 250 euro a notte, a colazione chiedo un espresso : lo pago 2,50 euro . 
Pulizia camera : il piumone lo tirano su e il bagno

Viele Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuss erreichbar, zudem halten verschiedene Busse (u.a. auch der Airport Link) direkt vor der Haustüre. Die Zimmer sind komfortabel eingerichtet, die Speisen im Restaurant schmecken gut. Infolge Umbauarbeiten war der Aufenthalt leider wenig erholsam, da diese auch in die Nacht andauerten. Die Preise sind v.a. in diesem Zusammenhang zu hoch.",3,2017,08,10
228,Andoni excelente guia,"Hemos hecho el Free Tour con Sandemans, y nos ha encantado. Hemos tenido la suerte de que nuestro guía fuera Andoni. Muy profesional, y a la vez muy entretenido, contandonos multitud de anécdotas de la ciudad y de los dublineses.

228,Ottima soluzione per un soggiorno confortevole.,"Ho scelto questo hotel dopo aver cercato su un famoso sito di prenotazioni. Poi Mi sono associato al programma Hilton honors, ed ho pagato ancora meno. Detto questo passiamo alla recensione. Non è certamente una soluzione a buon mercato in assoluto, ma sono soldi ben spesi . Ottima posizione vicino al cuore della città. Ottima colazione varia e ricca. La stanza comoda e rinnovata di recente , pulita ,con dei letti molto buoni.",4,2017,08,04
228,Zwei Nächte,"Freundliches und hilfsbereites Personal. Da es mir nicht gut ging, bekam ich nach einigem Hin und Her doch abends den von mir gewünschten Porridge, davor sogar noch 2 Scheiben Brot mit Butter. Wir mussten das sehr schöne Zimmer leider tauschen, da es ein Zimmer mit Tür zum NachbarZimmer hatte und wir jedes Wort verstehen konnten,  was dort gesprochen wurde. Auch das sehr laute Klappen der Türen störte uns sehr. Das Zimmer zum Fluß war durch die Sonneneinstrahlung sehr heiß. Bei geöffneten Fenster der Lärm nicht lange zu ertragen. Im neuen Zimmer zur Rückseite war es dann viel erträglicher. Sogar bei geöffneten Fenster konnten wir schlafen. Im Hotel ist man dabei eine Klimaanlage einzubauen, bzw. ist sie schon eingebaut, doch noch nicht funktionstüchtig. Da das Hotel aufgestockt wird, auch am heutigen Montag ziemlicher Baulärm. Unverständlich, dass einem Bauarbeiten nicht bei der Buchung mitgeteilt werden. Ansonsten ist alles sehr sauber! Die Lage zur Innenstadt und zum Hafen ideal. Am Frühstücksbüffet hatten wir nichts auszusetzen. Wunderbar! Das kostenlose und einfach einzustellende WLAN  prima und funktioniert. Ein große Garage gleich um die Ecke.",3,2017,07,24
228,Posizione ottima e cortesia,"L'hotel è attualmente in ristrutturazione quindi è stato un po' rumoroso in mattinata ma per il resto tutto è stato ok. La colazione presenta una scelta molto ampia con prevalenza di cibo irlandese. La stanza ampia e confortevole. Non all'ultimo grido a livello tecnologico ma il Wi-Fi funziona benissimo.
Consigliato.",4,2017,06,28

228,Appena fuori dal caos del centro,è ubicato nella zona business di Dublino ma a poca distanza dalla DART. E' facile raggiungere a piedi le attrazioni di Dublino in aree assolutamente più caotiche. La zona intorno all'Hotel è tranquillissima e permette di rientrare anche tardi la sera con famiglia al seguito. L'aerlink 747 all'arrivo ferma un po' distante dall'hotel 500m (Talbot) ma per andare all'aereoporto la fermata è proprio davanti l'hotel. Hotel tranquillo e pulito con ampie camere e colazione a buffet sensazionale.,5,2017,05,23
228,Pulito ed accogliente,"Io e la mia famiglia abbiamo alloggiato qui per 5 notti e ci siamo trovati benissimo. Albergo pulito, personale gentile e disponibile. Bar/Ristorante fornitissimo, specialmente per la colazione.

228,Quasi eccellente,"Direi tutto perfetto, hotel strategico non molto distante dal centro ( circa 15 min a piedi ), camera con vista river comoda e letto perfetto, colazione abbondante e di qualità waffel e omolette su richiesta, e cena che ci ha sbalordito: solo 24€ per una cena di qualità ed abbondante o molto utile per un'ottima Guinness rilassandosi vedendo una partita di Rugby in tv. Quai eccellente perchè se fosse ancora più in centro non avrebbe rivali.",4,2017,05,07
228,Sehr nettes Hotel,Wir verbrachten zwei Nächte in diesem neu renovierte Hotel. Der Service war sehr aufmerksam und die Lage für einen Stadtbummel sehr gut. Das Frühstück war reichhaltig und vor allem die Waffeln haben es den Kindern angetan. Wir würden wieder kommen.,4,2017,05,07
228,Muy cómodo y bien situado,"Contratamos el alojamiento con la tarjeta de fidelización. Ésto nos permitió conseguir el mismo precio que un apartamento para una gran habitación cuádruple con dos camas de 1.50 y con desayuno incluido.
Personal muy atento.
Desayuno típico irlandés (el desayuno Inglés es pequeño comparado con éste) muy completo. Pocos dulces para nuestras costumbres, pero mucho salado y muy""potente"".
Habitación muy cómoda, amplia y limpia.
Ubicación muy buena para ir en familia ya que hay un pequeño paseo a la zona céntrica, pero estas lo suficientemente lejos para huir del jaleo turístico.",4,2017,04,23

La cama grande para 2 personas no es muy grande, es de 135 cm., la pequeña para una persona es magnifica. Todo muy limpio. Personal muy amable y servicial, algunos hablan español. Desayuno completo, servido en un comedor amplio y bien distribuido. Relación calidad-precio muy buena reservando en la pagina del hotel y registrándote como miembro. El autobús hacia el aeropuerto para en la puerta del hotel, pero ¡ojo! al ser la ultima parada puede que venga lleno, a nosotros nos pasaron 3 autobuses llenos y tuvimos que tomar apresuradamente un taxi.",4,2017,01,04
228,Great Weekend,"Camera splendida (8/10), lounge bar ottimo (8/10) servizio cortese e professionale (8/10)

Complessivamente un'ottima struttura!",4,2016,12,29
228,"Cordialità, pulizia e posizione ottima ","Cordialità alla reception, pulizia e posizione ottima la fanno da padrona! In pochi minuti a piedi si accede direttamente alla zona di Temple bar, a Grafton street ed alla cattedrale di San Patrizio. Comodo anche il parcheggio di fianco all'hotel.
Colazione a 14,00€ a persona, abbastanza varia (abbondante soprattutto la parte del salato da colazione tipica irlandese). 
Consigliato!",4,2016,12,28
228,Hotel muy lindo,"El hotel está ubicado frente al río y para llegar al centro son 10 minutos caminando. Las habitaciones y el baño son normales, muy cómodos y limpios. La gente del hotel es muy servicial, tuve un problema con mi muela y una chica de recepción se encargó de llamar al dentista y a la farmacia, y me imprimió un mapa con los consultorios cerca. El desayuno es muy completo y variado.",4,2016,11,19
228,molto bello e curato,"Sono stato qui a fine agosto in viaggio di nozze e quindi premetto che non ho idea del costo della stanza essendo un viaggio organizzato dall’agenzia. Hotel situato vicinissimo ai punti strategici di Dublino. Il palazzo da fuori sembra una fabbrica ma dentro si apre una bellissima hall con tutti i confort possibili.  Le stanze non sono grandissime anzi forse un po' piccole e il bagno è piuttosto minuscolo e si, manca lo scopetto del wc e non è una novità all'estero. A me è capitato altre volte. In compenso la stanza è dotata di phon. Nonostante questo è sicuramente pulito. Nota negativa, i letti erano separati. Forse una svista dell'agenzia o della direzione. V'è il bollitore e tutto il necessario per farsi un tè o una tisana da soli. Wi.fi veloce stabile e inclusa in ogni stanza con televisore a led ma senza satellitare purtroppo. Le tende per oscurare la luce delle finestre sono sovrapponibili. Sembra una frivolezza ma credetemi il fatto che non filtri assolutamente luce è sicuramente piacevole e noi l'abbiamo notato ed apprezzato. Il parcheggio è alle sue spalle e non è ampissimo. Il personale alla reception cortese e disponibile. Purtroppo nessuno parlava l'italiano. Ha un ristorante al suo interno dove è possibile mangiare piatti tipici a prezzi standard con quelli trovati nei ristoranti e di ottima qualità. C'è persino la possibilità di avere la pizza (buona) oltre l'orario tipico della cucina (dopo le 22.00 e fino a notte inoltratata). Ha il servizio lavanderia e anche una lavanderia a gettone al suo interno. La colazione è ovviamente irish e c'è davvero da sbizzarrirsi in tutti i modi possibili. In definitiva, per un tre stelle è sicuramente superiore agli altri. Merita davvero.",5,2016,11,18
228,Lugar perfecto para alojarse!!,"Es un hotel que se encuentra a 15 minutos caminando de la zona de la vida nocturna, además de las calles donde pueden hacer compras y muchos restaurantes. 
La habitación muy cómoda, el baño un poco pequeño pero está bien. Tiene tabla de planchar y una buena secadora de pelo ( muy importante para nosotras las mujeres). El hotel cuenta con un cuarto de lavandería.
El lobby muy agradable y amplio, el desayuno variado y buena atención.",4,2016,11,07
228,"Céntrico, Cómodo y con gran calidad.","A pesar de ser un 3 estrellas, parece casi un 4 estrellas. Las habitaciones son amplias, luminosas, ventiladas y muy limpias. El personal muy amable y el restaurante un poco costoso pero alineado con la media de precios en Dublin. El gimnasio cumple con lo necesario para seguir la rutina diaria de entrenamiento. Una ubicación perfecta en el centro financiero bien conectado con Luas al city center o caminando unos 15 mins con la zona de Grafton. Totalmente recomendado.",5,2016,11,01
228,Angenehme Unterkunft mit Aussicht,"Nett gestaltetes Hotel mit Airportshuttleanbindung direkt vor der Tür.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und bemüht.
Das Frühstücksbuffet ist recht üppig, aber leider hauptsächlich aus convenience food bestehend.
Die Zimmer sind modern ausgestattet, sehr sauber und bieten bei Lage auf der Südseite einen großartigen Blick über Dublin, den Fluß Liffey und den Hafen.
Der abendliche Bar- und Restaurantbetrieb ist recht praktisch und gut gemacht, kann aber nicht mit dem Gesamtangebot der Pubs und Restaurants direkt in der Nähe mithalten.",3,2016,10,22

228,Guter Startpunkt für Besuch in Dublin,Das Hotel liegt sehr schön am Fluss Liffey und ist ein sehr guter Startpunkt für eine Stadtbesichtigung. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten und der Bezirk Templebar sind gut zu Fuß zu erreichen. Der Shuttelbus zum Flughafen hält direkt vor dem Hotel. Die Zimmer sind ausreichend groß und bieten alle notwendigen Annehmlichkeiten. Das Servicepersonal ist freundlich und sehr zuvorkommend. Das Frühstück ist umfangreich (irisches Frühstück und kontinentales Frühstück) und besonders die frischen Waffeln sind der Hammer.  ,4,2016,10,18
228,Mucho mas de tres estrellas,He estado por trabajo en este hotel. Cuando vi que era un hilton de tres estrellas me extrañó. Parece que lo acaba de comprar la cadena y lo ha modernizado. En breve subirá seguro de categoría. Nada que envidiar a un hotel de 4 estrellas. Las habitaciones están muy bien. El desayuno buffete muy bueno. Hotel MUY recomendable. Está a 5 minutos andando del centro (temple bar). ,5,2016,10,10

228,Buena ubicacion,"Me alojé aqui una semana. Hotel modernizado, habitacion amplia, limpia y bien provista. Desayuno de primer nivel (+ 14 euros) con todo lo que se pueda pensar. El Airlink 747 que va y viene al aeropuerto, tiene parada frente al hotel, y se ubica frente al rio Liffey, a escasos 300 metros del centro de convenciones, y unos 10 minutos de caminata a la zona colorida de temple bar.

228,Elegante pur con qualche pecca,"Non esattamente economico (150 euro) ma conveniente se si fa confronto con la (scadente) concorrenza e si considera la posizione strategica a pochi metri dall'Airport Shuttle e comodissima al cuore della città. Camere eleganti, apparentemente rifatte da poco, comode e gradevoli. Colazione a parte che non abbiamo provato. La pecca: incredibile che in un albergo frequentato da clientela business ma anche da persone magari in transito per l'aeroporto siano presenti, nel centro multimediale, solo tre computer LENTISSIMI e soprattutto NON IN GRADO DI APRIRE I PDF.. volevamo fare il check in in anticipo e stampare comodamente le nostre carte di imbarco in albergo, ma ciò non è stato possibile. Risolta questa piccola (ma fastidiosa) pecca l'albergo è sicuramente di alto livello.",4,2016,09,05
228,Ottimo hotel,"Davvero un ottimo hotel, in posizione un po' defilata (ma da cui si raggiunge agevolmente il centro in pochi minuti a piedi).

228,Passabile,"Abbastanza favorevole la posizione, ma un po' scadente nei servizi. 
Le camere sono abbastanza piccole, e la pulizia lascia un poco a desiderare.

La colazione è di tipo continentale, avrei gradito qualche dolcetto in più , ma pazienza

228,Discreto,"Note positive: la posizione (è possibile raggiungere i luoghi più interessanti a piedi in pochi minuti); la colazione (molto abbondante) ed il Wi-Fi free molto veloce e stabile.
Note negative: pulizia non eccezionale(manca persino lo scopetto per il water); camere un po' piccole e letti scomodi. Il discorso bidet lo ometto completamente perché all'estero per noi italiani è un disastro: è così quasi ovunque.

228,Dublin Zentral mit Aussicht,"Die Lage ist schöner als es auf der Karte aussieht. Blick über Dublin und River Liffy ist schon schön. Getrübt wird das nur durch die Hauptverkehrs Strasse vor dem Fenster. Lüften oder Lärm. 90% der Sehenswürdigkeiten sind mit einem angemessenen Fussmarsch erreichbar. Das Frühstück im Hotel ist ordentlich und zu einem fairen Preis, es gibt jedoch ausreichend Alternativen gleich um die Ecke. Das SevenWonders möchte ich dabei lobend erwähnen - vor allem wenn man nicht so viel frühstücken möchte. Das Zimmer hat eine ausreichende Größe wenn man ohnehin in der Stadt unterwegs ist, Wasserkocher mit Tee und Instant Kaffee, die Auswahl an Tee könnte größer sein. Das Bett ist bretthart - ich habe das genossen, meine Frau nicht so sehr.  Das Bad hat eine ausreichende Größe, die Auswahl an Pflegemitteln ist gut, es dürfte aber mehr als nur ein Duschgel für zwei Personen da stehen. Klobürsten sind in Dublin wohl verpöhnt. Ansonsten ein sauberes Zimmer, sauberes Hotel. Pantoffeln wären noch das Sahne Häuschen gewesen.",4,2016,07,13
228,Bueno pero lejos!,"El hotel es impecable, habitación y baño muy amplios y cómodos.  Muy buen placard y señal de internet. Buenísimo desayuno y variado a un precio accesible. Para en la puerta el hop on hop off y eso implica una ventaja. La cuestión es que está bastante lejos de old town y que no hay lugares buenos para ir a comer cerca del hotel.",3,2016,06,28
228,Excellent!,"Die Buchung dieses Hotels war ein Zufall und eine wunderbare Überaschung. Wir haben in keinem Hotel bisher so gut geschlafen. Der Service ist ausgezeichnet. Was man wissen sollte, ist, dass das Frühstück besser gleich mit gebucht wird, sonst ist es etwas teurer, aber dennoch jeden Cent wert. Das Hotel ist sehr zu empfehlen!",5,2016,06,21
228,Jederzeit wieder,"Wie waren über Pfingsten zwei Nächte im Hotel und hatten einen sehr angenehmen Aufenthalt. Das Personal an der Rezeption war sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Unser Zimmer war angemessen groß und sauber. Wir hatten einen Blick auf den Fluss, womit wir gar nicht gerechnet hatten. Man ist zu Fuß schnell in der Stadt und bei den Sehenswürdigkeiten. Unten im Hotel ist ein Costa Coffee, wo wir gefrühstückt haben, allerdings gibt es in der Nähe auch einige Cafes. Während unseres Aufenthalts wurde eine untere Etage des Hotels renoviert, wovon wir aber nichts mitbekommen haben. Wir würden jederzeit wieder in dem Hotel übernachten, weil es wirklich zentral für uns lag. Ein wichtiger Aspekt für die Buchung war, dass der Airlink Express zum Flughafen direkt vor dem Hotel hält. Allerdings handelt es sich bei der Haltestelle um eine der letzten Stationen, sodass die Busse zu unserer Reisezeit so überfüllt waren, dass vier der Busse, die in 10 Minuten- Abständen fahren, an uns vorbei fuhren und wir schon Angst hatten, dass wir nicht mehr mitgenommen werden und zu spät zum Flughafen kommen würden.",5,2016,06,12

Am ersten Juni wurde die Firmierung des Hotels auf Hilton geändert. Dadurch haben sich u.a. auch die Frühstückspreise geändert. Eingecheckt hatte ich am 30.05. Das Frühstück war nicht inbegriffen. Ich bin aber trotzdem im Hotel frühstücken gegangen. 
Das Frühstück unter der alten Firmierung war günstiger, das war auch der Preis der mir beim Check-In genannt wurde. Es wurde keinerlei Info darüber abgegeben, dass sich der Frühstückspreis ab dem 01.06. ändert. 
Es waren nur ein paar Euro mehr, aber von einem Hilton Hotel erwarte ich den Service, dass ich zumindest auf Preisänderungen hingewiesen werde, die in meinen Reisezeitraum fallen und mich betreffen.

Was nicht ok war ist die Tatsache, dass das Hotel einen Betrag beim Check-In auf der Kreditkarte reservieren wollte. Dieser Betrag war höher als der tatsächlich zu bezahlende. Dieser Betrag wurde mir nicht mitgeteilt. Es wurde gesagt, der Betrag meiner Buchung (Zimmerpreis) wird reserviert. Der tatsächlich zu zahlende Betrag setzte sich durch den Zimmerpreis und die Frühstücke zusammen, aber beim Check-In stand noch nicht fest, ob wir im Hotel frühstücken oder nicht. Ich finde das schon ein etwas seltsames Geschäftsgebaren einen ca. € 200,00 höheren Betrag zu reservieren, wie den, den man tatsächlich bezahlen muss.

Dann hatte ich beim Check-In nach einem Zimmer nach hinten gefragt. Dies wurde aber abgelehnt mit der Begründung, dass mein Zimmer eine viel schönere Aussicht hätte. Das stimmte auch, allerdings war es extrem laut, wegen Verkehrslärm. Mit offenem Fenster konnte man daher nicht schlafen. Mit geschlossenem Fenster wurde es extrem warm in Zimmer. Eine Klimaanlage gab es nicht.

Alles in allem war mein Aufenthalt ok, auch das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis stimmte. Das Frühstück war ok, die Betten etwas weich. Im Zimmer gab es ausser einem kleinen Kleiderschrank noch nicht einmal Kleiderhaken.
Es gab in unserem Doppelzimmer nur eine Sitzgelegenheit, sodass einer von uns immer auf dem Bett liegen musste, wenn wir mal im Hotelzimmer waren. 
Die Aussicht unseres Zimmers auf den Liffey war wirklich schön, aber diese hätte ich gerne gegen etwas mehr Ruhe eingetauscht. 
Das Hotel ist ca. 500-700 m von Temple Bar entfernt. In 10-15 Minuten ist man zu Fuss im Zentrum. Eine Bushaltestelle gibt es direkt vor dem Hotel.

Was erwähnenswert war, ist die Freundlichkeit des Personals.",3,2016,06,09
