103,Lovely hotel close to everything but also in quiet spot,Great hotel close to Paddington station and Hyde park but also in a quiet location. Clean and well managed with very approachable and friendly staff - Kazi was especially helpful and patient with our requests. We had a first floor room at the back of the hotel that overlooked other courtyards and gardens. TV and WiFi and shower  were good quality and there’s a lovely little bar and coffee shop that’s good for meetings. Deli sandwich bars close by and would recommend these rather than usual hotel breakfasts.,5,2024,10,13
103,Nightmare,Absolutely horrendous customer service. We arrived and no room available (we checked online and you could book a room in the hotel on various sites) where would you stay if the hotel was full which is what we were told. We were told to relocate to there sister hotel. When we arrived the room was a double bed in the basement for two friends. Absolutely tiny room a compact double is whatcwe were told! We had requested a twin. We had been told we could have free cancellation if we weren't satisfied to which we asked for and we're told they couldn't issue the refund. First time ever complaining but I just felt compelled to tell as many people as I could not to bother with this hotel.,1,2024,10,10
103,Rooms very small and smelly,"The rooms were tiny and smelt musty. There were some sort of insect/moth living in the carpets. 
The beds felt damp, net curtains were attached to the main black out curtain so you couldn’t open just curtain without keeping a bit of privacy.
Location is good close to the tube station and restaurants. 
Definitely won’t be staying here again.",1,2024,10,04
103,Charging multiple times,Booked direct through the website where I was charged over the internet. On arrival after confirming I had paid already and showing the balance clearing my account the service desk wouldn't allow me to check in without paying again. I have tried to contact the hotel several times to resolve but no one will reply. Room was small and basic for the price paid.,1,2024,09,30
103,Good access to Paddington station,"Positive: 
Good location for access to Paddington station
Clean room
Reasonably comfortable bed
Helpful and friendly reception staff

Not so good:
Broken window catch - meaning window could not be secured. Which would have been useful as we were in the basement. 
Breakfast was lukewarm warm and underwhelming. 

A light over and power points next to the mirror would be helpful",3,2024,09,28
103,Love Park Grand Paddington ,"A big thank you to the wonderful staff at the PFP! Great location, lovely vibe. Spacious, well-appointed room, with excellent bathroom. We looked onto leafy gardens - so quiet, birds singing: amazing for so close to the city! Special thanks to Kazi, who could not do enough for us, and all the staff who were so lovely and helpful! We loved this hotel and will definitely stay there again! ",5,2024,09,26
103,Do not stay here.,"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Expensive, small basement rooms. Damp walls and a split mattress.
No reception at the Devonshire building, so felt very unsafe. 
When we tried to tell the receptionist at check out, she didn’t care at all.",1,2024,09,25
103,"Extremely tiny single rooms, basement and ground floor rooms","I booked a single and at first they tried to put me in the basement. I complained, and the best next solution was to put me in the main floor. The room is extremely tiny, about half the size of the lowest priced cabin in a cruise ship. No good place to put the suitcase or other things. The electricity on the desk is not working. I went to the front desk and complained and so far no one has come. I just came from a long train trip and my iPad and iPhone are low on power - I am using batteries to power them. I don’t give it one star because at least the room is modern and clean.",2,2024,09,24
103,"Overpriced hotel, with poor customer service.","I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Terrible reservations team.

I spent all weekend trying to cancel a booking, and i could never get through to a reservation team member.

I phoned the front of house only to be told ring again at 8am. So i phoned again to be messed around and passed from pillar to post & every member of staff i spoke to could not help me.

My last phone call i spoke to a lady on the front desk and said ""didnt you speak to my manager?"" & then took my details, to which i had no phone call.

Upon arrival at the hotel i explained that i only wanted 1 night stay and not 3, the guy didnt give a damn and could not be less interested in helping me. I was told ""speak to reservation team"" & i told him about my troubles in cancelling/amending my booking and he was so unhelpful and not interested at all.

The hotel was ok, overpriced for what it is, but it is london and a good location. 

The bed was far too soft, in section 3 room 603 needs a new mattress, the room isnt wired up properly so the light between doors doesnt turn on and the ceiling lights are randomly turning on/off and brightness changes too.

I wasnt in the room long, i was out all day and had concerts all evening, but very annoying arriving in the dark and cant see where to hang coat/access safe etc. 

Cleaning of my room was fantastic, very clean each day so 10/10 for cleaning.

Breakfast was average - standard cooked egg/bacon/sausage/beans/mushrooms/tomato and hashbrowns or new potatos, limited choices of bread/pastries/fruits/yogurts. Think Holiday Inn but far less impressive.

The breakfast area is too small, it was chaos everyday and stations were not filled up quickly enough.",1,2024,09,20
103,Great location,"Firstly the area and location is first class so would absolutely recommend it from this perspective.

The rooms were typical London - small but comfortable.

I would definitely recommend for location and ease at which to get around London and explore",4,2024,09,07
103,Convenient London Hotel,"We had a fantastic stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court. It was reasonably priced, clean and comfortable accommodation. Check in was easy as we prepaid and our room was serviced daily. The room was a little small, but had everything we needed. Comfortable bed, rainfall shower, air conditioning and adequate room for all of our luggage. 

The location is perfect, in a quite street that is a close walk to cafe's, pubs and convenience shops. Within a 5 minute walk, the Raffles Cafe was our favourite for a full English Breakfast in the morning before enjoying the attractions of London on a hop-on, hop-off bus at the nearby bus stop, or the tube station. It is also a short walk to the beautiful Hyde Park. We also recommend a pint or wine at the nearby Pride of Paddington pub after a day of sightseeing.

We would definitely return to the Park Grand Paddington Court and recommend it for tourists.",5,2024,09,06
103,Unprofessional and Disappointing Experience,"I had a highly disappointing experience with the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel. I had booked a room well in advance, looking forward to staying at this hotel specifically for its location and amenities. However, as I was literally boarding my flight to London, I received an email informing me that I was being relocated to a different hotel due to ""urgent maintenance"" at the Park Grand Paddington Court.

This last-minute notification was extremely unprofessional and left me in a very uncomfortable situation upon arrival. To make matters worse, the alternative hotel they sent me to (Inhabit Southwick Street Hotel) was far below the standard I had expected. The room was tiny, had no windows, and lacked any proper ventilation. It was a far cry from the room I had originally booked and paid for.

The lack of prior notice, combined with the poor quality of the alternate accommodation, showed a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. I would strongly advise others to be cautious when booking with this hotel, as their communication and service were sorely lacking in my experience.",1,2024,08,14
103,An exemplary family HOTEL In London 's Paddington  location !,"We celebrated our 37th   WEDDING ANNIVERSARY  & my Birthday  at  The Park Grand Paddington  Court Hotel.  The front staff treated us like loyalty ... They helped  us  get from  place to place using Taxi or the Tube. Restaurants referrals  were in walking distance of the hotel. We loved the room accommodations & daily breakfast that meet our dietary needs! I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THE GRAND PADDINGTON COURT  HOTEL TO ALL TRAVELING  TO LONDON WHO WANT A WELL RUN HOTEL, CUSTOMER ORIENTED  & KNOWLEDGEABLE  STAFF

",5,2024,08,13
103,Disappointing,"I had an extremely disappointing experience at this hotel. 

Upon arrival, I had to wait over 30 minutes to check in due to the guest ahead of me dealing with a large group of students, which apparently caused issues with the check-in process. Shockingly, there was only one staff member handling check-ins, leading to a frustrating and chaotic experience. To make matters worse, all the seats in the lobby were taken, so I had to stand the entire time on dirty floors and students walking and talking everywhere. Due to the waiting, it left me with a sore back and shoulders from holding my luggage. Would have been ideal to have a concierge or extra staff or so.

When I finally got to my room, I was met with a strong, unpleasant smell of dampness, and the bathroom had an equally bad odor. I called reception straight away, but despite being promised a callback within five minutes, I waited for 25minutes with no response. We were running late for an event, so I just left open the windows to air out the room. To add, i had such issues with opening one of the window as it stiff and difficult to operate. Without any clear instructions, I accidentally hurt my finger while trying to force them open. We eventually left the room with the windows open and went to reception to address the issue, but the staff were busy with even more guest, and we couldn’t afford to wait any longer.

Returning later that night, I attempted to take a shower, only to find that the water was cold to lukewarm at best. Again, I tried to contact the hotel by phone and message, but received no response. Exhausted, I gave up and went to sleep, only to have my rest interrupted several times around 7am onward by loud noises from other guests’, despite having requested a quiet room.

Adding to my dissatisfaction, the room lacked a smart TV, which I had specifically requested, and instead had a generic TV. The only time the hotel bothered to contact me was to remind me about checking out, without addressing any of the issues I raised during my stay. To top it all off, the bruise on my finger from the stiff window has since turned black.

Overall, this stay was absolutely disappointing, with poor service, unaddressed issues, and a complete lack of care from the hotel staff. I will be raising a complaint in regards to this",1,2024,08,12
103,"Not a 4 star hotel, but clean roomservice. Kasi is great.","Slightly scammy hotel, where you are forced to upgrade your room if you are not a dwarf. We had booked a double room, and on the hotels website it said space for 2 adults. 
Nevertheless we found ourselves looking at a big single bed upon entering the hotel room after checking in - a so called compact double.

Then they forced us to upgrade our room for 30 pounds per night, (after negotiating it down from 50) , so we could get a bed with space for 2 normal sized adults.

The rooms are also not soundproof - to say the least  - and they are too small. 

2 positive things: 
- Clean and good roomservice
- Kasi at the reception was friendly and open , and he did his best to help us out",2,2024,08,09
103,Not again,"The room in the cellar was about 3 squaremeter of a size, the bed was wet because it was located directly underneath a window where the wet air sinked into the pillow. A strange noise of a machine in the back kept me awake during the night. One of the worst experiences. The matraces was at the end of its life and was approximately 90 cm wide. Not a friendly place at all.",1,2024,07,30
103,Kazi at the front desk is wonderful!,"Kazi at the front desk made our stay extra nice! He helped us with a nice room, with a hop-on-hop-off bus tour, and general information about the area.  The breakfast area was pleasant and well staffed.  The rooms are very small, but we knew this when we booked it. The location is wonderful in Paddington, close to Hyde Park and bus/tube lines, and restaurants.",4,2024,07,29
103,"Terrible, avoid!","Booked an afternoon tea via a buy a gift voucher. On arrival was told they don’t offer afternoon tea anymore. Queried why I wasn’t told it was cancelled and they blamed a former member of staff and have no apology. Told to wait in an outdated bar area that looked more like a travel lodge and then the manager was rude and dismissive. Looks like a budget chain hotel, with bad service, avoid!",1,2024,07,28
103,Fantastic stay,"Beds very comfortable, breakfast very nice ,room nice and cool, suitable and reasonable for a couple of nights stay within walking distance to Paddington station I really recommend staying here. Everyone member of staff seemed welcoming and friendly",5,2024,07,21
103,Locational advantage,"A comfortable stay of four nights.  The staff are exceedingly responsive to guest complaints.  As we were dissatisfied with the room allotted initially, they shifted us to a better and more spacious one.  The breakfast served is sumptuous.  The location of the hotel close to Paddington Station, Kensington Park makes it super convenient. Highly recommended.  

",4,2024,07,21
103,Excellent,"The location was perfect.Close to Hyde Park which was inportant for us, because of the concert.Paddington station, Kensington Palace,Science museum,Restaurants, shops very close as well.The hotel room was very clean, nice and spacious for us with essential amenities( TV, fridge, wifi, air conditioner)The bathroom was very clean with full amenities.Thanks for the housekeepers!!!The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Kazi.Thank you so much for Kazi the beautiful surprise to my daughter/she had birthday.
Our few days was really enjoyable.Thank you!",5,2024,07,19
103,Worst stay ever!,"This hotel has to be the worst i have ever stayed in. The rooms are dark and dismal and have the strangest smell that combined with the air conditioning hurt my throat and made me feel physically sick!
 Plug sockets didn’t work so I was unable to charge my phone.
The many odd stairs to the room are shabby and confusing as you go up 3 flights then down again to get to your room!
The photos on the website are not representative of what the rooms really look like and definitely not like any other 4* hotel I have stayed in.
 I have tried to contact the hotel but they simply hang up when I ask for the manager!! Terrible customer service!",1,2024,07,18
103,Small bed,"Staff were polite and the people on the front desk were efficient, we found the hotel to be clean and in a good location. We were pleased the room was ready for us when we checked in in the morning, but the bed was tiny. We had a Double room , which I thought would mean a double bed , but the bed was half way between a single bed and a double which was very uncomfortable and way too small for me and my wife. The reception told we should have booked a delux room",2,2024,07,18
103,Not worth the money I paid but a great location,"We stayed here for Stevie Nicks at BST Hyde Park.   Against my better judgement I booked an expensive non-refundable rate via Booking.com which was purely down to the fact this suited our needs for location (close to Hyde Park and underground access) and our busy schedule and early start the following day.   I'm therefore glad I didn't read the reviews before I stayed as I would've been extremely anxious, especially as Booking.com had fielded our reservation through to another third party provider!  Lucky for us we did have a room reserved and the staff at reception were friendly and courteous.  

But... !  The room was very small for two people and our window looked straight into someone else's room (if you watch Friends think 'Joey and his neighbour in the next apartment singing to each other out of their windows' close!) so no wonder the curtain was closed when we went into the room!   On arrival back to the room after the concert my husband made himself a coffee and the kettle overflowed (not due to being overfilled) and flooded the unit it was situated on which is a big health and safety issue.  The aircon in the room wasn't even worth having as it had no impact whatsoever but luckily our English summer is non-existent this year so it didn't matter too much but would've been nice at the same time.  

The worst thing about our stay was being kept awake for most of the night due to external generators/aircon units noise.  When we checked out I did intend to mention this to the receptionist but because we needed to leave London in a hurry I didn't have the opportunity so if you are assigned Room 120 just be aware you may not sleep!

Would I stay again? It wouldn't be first on my list but maybe I would because the location was excellent for us and the staff were friendly.   However, I really wouldn't want to be spending £200 on a hotel/room where improvements need to be made but I guess that's London prices for you?!",3,2024,07,16
103,Perfect stay and great location,"Great location, allowed us to leave our luggage before checking in, then after a hectic day we arrived , room was perfect, gratis peanuts and prisecco , and biscuits and hot chocolate for daughter, a welcome treat . Then breakfast,  bang on with relaxed feel and timings meant we can just walk in, treat it as a home. Staff perfect with everyone and everything, perfect ! Thank you park grand , wish we could/have booked or stayed longer.",5,2024,07,15
103,Worst Hotel.,"This experience was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We were promised a celebratory bottle of Prosecco in the room for a birthday celebration that was not provided despite asking twice. There is no mirrors in the room for getting ready and lighting is absolutely awful. The room was covered in damp and had a really horrible smell, along with the hallway leading up to the rooms. When asked if we could be moved, may excuses were made. The room service was absolutely shocking. Dirty tea cups were not changed and left from night before, not enough towels left in room, toilet roll not provided and when I went over to reception which is in another building and was told they were come over right away, 45 minutes later, a very miserable women pretty much rammed the toilet roll in my hand. Tea bags were rent replenished so again had to go to reception to ask for more. I am absolutely appalled at his hotel and will never be staying again. The breakfast was average for a hotel and customer service just awful. I will not be returning and I urge everyone to avoid also. Only good thing is it’s at a good location from the tube station.",1,2024,07,14
103,Proceed with caution,"I booked this hotel for an event at Hyde park four months before the arrival date. Due to some travel complications we arrived a bit later than we expected. We were told our room wasn’t available and we were going to be moved to a sister hotel 5 miles away. Obviously, unacceptable. At no point was I contacted by the hotel. 

They blamed it on unforeseen circumstances (I think they overbooked) and said there was nothing that could be done. There were no other rooms and I had to go to the other hotel. The costumer service was dismissive and arrogant. 

When I mentioned they were in fact, in breach of contract and refused to leave until I saw the manager they happened to find me a room across the road, in another building. This room was a twin room, not double. It was ok. But definitely not what I paid for. I was just tired of arguing and wanted to get to my concert. 

Bear in mind if booking here, you might get fobbed off",2,2024,07,13
103,ABSOLUTE CHAOS Go somewhere else!!!,"So I wrote a review for this SHOCKING hotel and deleted to update it. 
Pictures of the original review and response in pictures. 
This hotel emailed and promised prosecco and a great room for our anniversary. We didn't receive this, not even the deluxe room we booked but a room with single beds pushed together in a building across the road! 
Our whole weekend was ruined because of the complete chaos caused by this hotel, they completely messed up and not just for us but by the looks and sounds of it for everyone staying there at the same time as us! 
The excuse.... the staff went to hospital! I've read similar experiences since...  the excuse..  a flood taking out a whole floor!! 
This hotel needs some serious staff management and training.
We have contacted the hotel and they refused to help over the phone. They said we HAD to email..... emailed and guess what.... they haven't responded! Disgusting customer service! I suggest someone takes a look at the emails...  looks up the booking.... 4643844029 and contacts us as a matter of urgency. You can not treat people like this.  We paid for a room and service we did not receive.  Book some where else because this place is a joke.",1,2024,07,12
103,Worst experience ever. Do not recommend.,"Absolutely awful experience. My partner and I came to this hotel for an event at Hyde Park. This was a surprise for his birthday which was booked 5 weeks beforehand. We got to the hotel just before 3pm and was greeted by a large queue extending to outside the hotel. After waiting a while we could hear the frustrations from other guests as they were waiting for an extremely long time to check in. Eventually we got to the front desk, checked in and given a key only when we got to the room, someone was already in there. Understandably we was frustrated as we was now late to the event and missed the first act. We went back to the reception and the attitude from the staff was unacceptable. We told them what had happened and instead of dealing with our situation, they made us wait a further 40+ minutes whilst they continued to serve others. When we asked how much longer we needed to wait, staff would ignore us and walk away from reception for a period of time before returning and serving another customers. Within this time around 4 couples came back to reception saying they were booked into someone else’s room. Everyone was getting very frustrated, very understandably, however staff did not seem to care or respond appropriately. Communication was non-existent by reception staff only making customers more frustrated. Eventually, after around an hour waiting like fools at reception being ignored, we were told there was no double rooms available but we could go into two separate single rooms. This was not really ideal, however we had to take it due to being hours away from home and there for an event which cost a lot of money and would have been stranded if we did not take it. We looked for another hotel whilst waiting but there was none available in close proximity. Rooms were extremely small and I did not feel comfortable and did not sleep at all due to feeling worried and anxious especially after earlier events with people put into someone else’s room. On check out, we asked for a full refund which we was told we would definitely get however after nearly a week I am yet to get. Which is disgusting. I have never been in such an experience, especially for a 4* hotel. I’m extremely unhappy and it ruined a good day, especially for my partners birthday. It was humiliating and unacceptable to be treated the way we were. I get mistakes happen, however there was no accountability taken by reception staff. I am still wanting my refund and expect to have this due to not getting the service or room I paid for. Not happy at all! Do not recommend this place.",1,2024,07,10
103,Great location!,"This was a really great find! Amazing location, just a short walk from Paddington station & so easy to find, for a great price. 
First impressions were great, the reception is beautiful with very friendly staff. We were pleasantly surprised to find that we could check in early as our room was ready. 
The rooms had air con which was a blessing and the mini fridge was a bonus to store our drinks in. Although the room was on the smaller side it was perfect for what we needed. The only gripe would be that for someone a little more chunky getting in the shower cubicle was interesting, but I managed. 
Our stay on the whole was really enjoyable and we’d stay here again just for the location alone, the staff, air con etc were just an added bonus.",4,2024,07,08
103,Great Value!,"Absolute bargain & great value for money, we paid £160 for a Saturday night in peak July.

We staid over for a concert in Hyde Park. Location was perfect, only 8 minute walk. 

Room was small, but had all amenities. Bed was comfy, fridge, dressing table & the shower was very powerful. Cleanliness was on point. 

Had read some previous negative reviews, but in my opinion it’s difficult to complain about anything for the value. Far exceeded my expectations. Very good!",5,2024,07,07
103,Awful experience. Absolute chaos - ended up booking another hotel and asking for a refund after over an hours wait.,"Booked this hotel to go to an event at Hyde Park. Arrived just before 3pm thinking we could quickly run up to the room, change and head that way in half an hour max. However, there was a long queue out the door and people seemed upset. As the next hour unfolded it became clear why. 
They had overbooked the double rooms, sending some people away to other hotels, asking others to sit and wait (not sure what for - the staff seemed to be panicking with the customers that had questions and/or complaints) or trying to get couples to stay in 2 separate singe rooms. Obviously the lack of speed & clear communication frustrated everyone and some began shouting and refusing to leave the desk until they had a room they booked. Someone questioned why a member of staff was laughing as he walked away, to which he replied 'are you ok?' - disgusting attitude.
At no point did a member of staff think to communicate to customers in the queue (which got longer and longer out onto the street) what was happening. It wasn't until someone who was at the front turned to everyone else and told us what was happening. At least 2 couples were given keys to rooms that already had someone else's luggage and belongings in - when they came back to reception and shouted this, the staff had no idea what to do or say.
It took over an hour to get to the desk ourselves and in this time, my sister was able to book another hotel online; run there and check in and return to join me in the queue! 
We asked for a refund and confirmation email which seemed to confuse the staff member behind the desk. We said we did not trust his word alone (after he persistently kept saying 'I have refunded you, it is done') and asked him to send an email to us with our reference number and details, confirming the cancellation and full refund. He took my sister's email address and said 'done' - we kept checking and nothing. He became frustrated with us, raising his voice and repeating himself that 'I have refunded you - you will get an email from Booking.com'. 
In the end we said we'd go back in the morning and quickly rushed to our other hotel, unfortunately further away from Hyde Park. By the time we had got to our room, changed and walked there we had missed the first 3 hours and several artists we had been waiting months to see and paid a lot of money for!  
Would never return here and we have warned any friends and family to stay clear.",1,2024,07,05
103,"Terrible, distressing and unprofessional experience. Avoid at all costs.","I travelled from Newcastle to London on 04/07/24 for the BST event at Hyde Park, I arrived at the hotel approx 11AM after travelling since 7AM to check-in to my room which I'd had booked since the 08/03/24. I paid for the room on 30/06/24 and I had queried about an early check-in due to needing to be at Hyde Park for the BST event which began at 1PM that day. I was advised by the hotel that I would come to know on the day whether or not an early check-in could be possible, if not then I'd be able to store my bags at the hotel until I could check-in which was fine. I arrived, slightly nervous due to travelling alone and explained I was looking to check-in, possibly with an early check-in, I was sarcastically told ""let's just go through the procedure first"". I gave my ID and payment card at the desk when asked and wasn't advised of any issues. I was informed by the desk clerk that he knew from looking at the system that my room definitely wasn't ready but I could check my bag in and return later for my room key, I was advised where the restroom and bar was in the hotel area and my bag was tagged for storing. I left the hotel and attended the event, returning at approximately 11:40PM, I approached the desk to a different clerk and asked for my room key, explaining that I'd been there earlier but my room wasn't ready however my bag had been stored as previously agreed. At this point, I was exhausted, sunburnt and after being on my feet for 12 hours, all I wanted was to rest in my room before I returned to Newcastle via train the following day. I was asked to write down my name on a piece of paper, which I did, slightly confused as my ID had been taken prior that day and I'd given my email address, mobile number etc despite this being on the booking.com form initially. I was then asked, did you receive an email about your booking. I was even more confused and now concerned at this point, I showed the clerk the booking email and advised I had paid for my room. During this timeframe, other guests were being dealt with, meaning I was left standing like not only a complete fool but none the wiser as to what the delay was - apparently someone asking for a sachet of coffee for the morning was more important than me standing there waiting for my room key which should have been quite a simple process. I was met with looks of confusion and panic as the desk clerk made a call on his mobile and returned, informing me that I should have received an email explaining about a ""huge system fault"" which meant I was being transferred to another hotel which was their sister hotel. I confirmed I definitely didn't receive any email, I'd even messaged the hotel on my way from Newcastle to request early check-in seeing as the original advice was that I would come to know on the day if this was possible. I thought it would have been painstakingly obvious to make this known to me when I was at the hotel about 12 hours prior having my bag held in storage if I wasn't meant to be at that hotel? After some back and forth where I simply wanted an explanation as to what was going on given it was midnight and I was stood in a hotel lobby with drunk obnoxiously loud people trying to understand what was going on. I'm a young girl who was travelling solo, and had based my trip around the location of Hyde Park, this hotel and Paddington Station, it's clear why this would be distressing. I was given a bit of paper with the new hotel name and address on, Inhabit on Southwick Street and told that a cab would be booked yet no further details about what to do, and where to go from there, would I have to pay again, where was my bag etc. I had to ask whether or not they would be paying the cost of the cab despite this not being my fault. Other guests were interrupting the conversation and the clerk was willingly stopping to assist them which caused further delays and confusion to my situation. A group consisting of two couples who had clearly experienced the same issue arrived, understandably irate and distressed at the lack of urgency, professionalism or explanation as to how there could have been such a problem without a plan of action. They were being transferred to a different hotel than me despite their requests for me to be transferred to the same as I was on my own - I am in awe that complete strangers were more concerned for my safety and welfare than the hotel who had taken my money before my booking. I was taken to another room to retrieve my bag and asked to take a seat. I sat in the reception, not sure if the taxi had been booked or was on its way, at this point it was after midnight. About 15 minutes passed and I grew even more tired of waiting for action with no result and I approached the desk clerk again, asking what was going on. He said the taxi was booked but he couldn't give a time frame. After the couple's insistence, a manager eventually appeared full of false apologies, explaining there had been a leak which cleared an entire floor of rooms - completely contradicting what we'd been told earlier that there had been a huge system error. It was embarrassing to watch at this point and all patience was lost from everyone experiencing this complete debacle. I was advised I'd be given a complementary breakfast from the new hotel, which wasn't in any way to be compensated seeing as I would be travelling early the next day. I was eventually advised the taxi was here and they gave the driver the money upfront, I was given false apologies with a smirk from the manager who looked like he'd just come back from a night on the town and sent off in a black cab. Still, on my own after midnight in the capital city which I'm unfamiliar with. The driver was thankfully very helpful and he advised that this happens constantly with this hotel but also the hotel he was taking me to and it's their way of ensuring their rooms are fully booked and paid for, it's their way of scamming people and ensuring they aren't out of pocket. The service was absolutely disgusting and I couldn't be more disappointed my night ended this way after such an amazing day at Hyde Park. The irony is if I had tried to cancel my room so last minute then I wouldn't be entitled to my money back therefore it should be the same in principle. I arrived at the next hotel and was taken down a corridor on the ground floor to a shoebox sized room, the bathroom was tiny and the room didn't even have a curtain track which fit the window meaning the fire escape looked straight onto my bed. An absolutely awful experience and I would advise anyone to steer clear of this hotel chain. The fact you have ""what did we miss"" and transfer information on your survey section speaks VOLUMES. Avoid this hotel and their sister chains if you don't want to be messed around and have your entire day ruined by such idiocy. I took out insurance on this trip and I'm thankful I did as I'll be looking to not only pursue that but also make an official complaint as this entire ordeal was completely unacceptable.",1,2024,07,05
103,"Great hotel, fantastic location!","We visited this hotel for 3 nights during our spring break trip from the United States. We were traveling as a group of 6, and required 2 rooms, which was fine. 

When we arrived, we were given one room that was as expected and a room that had a Murphy bed, absolutely not the kind of room that was advertised.  

The front desk offered to give me a different room later in the day, and moved our luggage for us. I was grateful, but it was a disappointing start to our first hotel in London. 

Breakfast was good, but a bit overpriced for kids, who barely eat. Would be nice if breakfast were included in the rate, or discounted for kids. 

The rooms are not set up like US hotels, they are on different floors/levels, which was fun!  The heated bathroom floor was the highlight for my kids!

Great location, great service, was a memorable stay!",5,2024,07,04
103,Poor Customer Experience,Terrible customer experience. Sent me to a sister hotel that didn't serve breakfast or have an onsite gym meaning I had to go back to the original hotel for both of those things. The reason I booked that hotel was for the gym so overbooking and sending customers to an inferior hotel is completely unacceptable. Tried every email on the website to complain and heard nothing back. Won't stay again,1,2024,07,04
103,Terrible,"Worst experience ever, and I have travelled for business all my life. The room had a very strong odour. Left the room and kept a window open. Came back to sleep. Unbearable. Please save yourself. It was a bit cheaper and I should have known better.",1,2024,07,03
103,Very poorly organised!!! Terrible hotel!!!,"Went to check in at 1pm but we were advised our room wasn't ready and check in wasn't until 3pm so we left our luggage and returned at 3pm to find a huge cue out onto the road. People were shouting and arguing with the staff as none of the rooms were ready! Some people had to get relocated to other hotels. We cued for an hour only to find our room wasn't ready!!! So we left our bags and returned at 1am in the morning, they
advised us they were going to put us in a double bed room but they didn't have one when we returned so we slept in a twin room. Just poorly managed and staffed, really tarnished our overnight stay to London. Would avoid this hotel at all costs!",1,2024,07,01
103,Unfortunate experience on our last night in the UK,"We stayed one night before a flight back home after a 2 week stay in the UK. We had a great trip, with this hotel providing the only bad experience. We had booked a triple room (there were 3 of us). From the booking process and website we had expected two proper beds, but discovered that we had one large, good bed and a very small pull out couch bed in poor condition (old, peeling cushions for example). Moreover the room was made up for 2 - no sheets on the couch bed and towels for 2. Even worse, when we opened the dresser drawers, they were full of garbage - mostly empty liquor bottles. The hotel did quickly rectify the problem (leaving a bottle of prosecco and some chocolates as an apology), cleaning the room properly and providing more linens. The room was nice after the problems had been resolved, albeit quite small. I had booked a more expensive hotel room for our last night, hoping to end our trip on a high note - it did the opposite.",2,2024,06,30
103,Book somewhere else if you want to stay in this location,"When we arrived the staff told us they had moved us to another hotel, at the Barbican. Nowhere near our chosen location for our short family holiday.
The guy went through the entire check in process and only told us when we asked to book breakfast.
Really frustrating, especially after a long flight and evening arrival when all we wanted was a bite to eat, quick wander round the area and bed. They weren't helpful with giving us details about the place they wanted to send us to, just showed us an address written on a scrap of paper. 
After some negotiations they arranged for upgraded rooms and breakfast included, in recompense for the inconvenience and our increased fees for airport transfer at the end of our stay.",1,2024,06,27
103,Don’t stay here!,"I paid for a superior double room. On arrival I was told my room was t a yams I was walked to their sister hotel where I was given a grubby, dark and dingy basement toom with a single bed and tiny room. The Window was broken and couldn’t be locked. I felt unsafe. I complained but they didn’t seem to care, I was show. Two further tiny rooms both had broken old windows
No one apologised, no refund for the room I had paid for . After a long three hour journey to get there I found this upsetting and irresponsible.",1,2024,06,26
103,Disappointed,"Set off on our journey to the capital to then find an email being changed to there sister hotel Park grand Hyde park. Gave a reservations number to contact which is just an answer machine message - unable to speak with anyone. 

Hyde park hotel room small as expected bed comfy and room clean. Breakfast was adequate and priced for London hotels.  Air con worked sometimes a little noisy. Ceiling light above bed flickering advised reception said maintenance would be called to go and fix it - alas not done. 
Bath towels more like the size of hand towels so useless. 
Stairs up to room so not all bedrooms have lift access so worth noting. 
Wouldn’t stay again as prefer a little bit more luxury in the room and decent size towels and more flexibility when being moved at short notice.  Apparently  this is something the do quite often is move your booking to the sister hotel",2,2024,06,25
103,Great stay!,"Great stay!  Small rooms but only slept and showered there.  Lovely, efficient staff!  Good English breakfast .  Plenty of choices.  Convenient to tube and train.  Felt safe as a solo traveler.  Loved that everything was electronic access.  Thanks for the stay!",5,2024,06,21
103,"Nice place, shame about the face","A stay of two nights was ample. 

The pictures attached will show the general state of the room, not kept up at all and dated. 

Breakfast mainly caters for the Americans, (and a large proportion of the guests were staying there were American.
Pancakes, Waffles, Doughnuts.... There is no English mustard available!!! (as an Englishman, I find that very inconvenient!!)

It is however in a superb position for central London, for the tubes and buses and London overground.",3,2024,06,21
103,Double charged and refuses to fix it,"I reserved a two night stay and emailed a month in advance that I would have a very late check in following an international flight. When I arrived, the front desk spent 40 minutes on the phone with an unknown manager/office/something, ultimately saying it looked on their end as though my reservation had been cancelled. They refused to give me a room until I paid again. When my booking agent contacted them, they claimed I had not shown for my reservation, so *they* had cancelled it. I tried, again, to solve this with the staff in person, showing them the email I had sent the previous month. Staff said they would ""work something out,"" but did not by the time I had to check out and continue travels. They are now refusing to answer calls from my booking agent. I believe these actions are in violation of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, and would not recommend giving them your business.",1,2024,06,20
103,Great location and super hotel.,"The location was perfect for us. It was just 10 minutes walk from Hyde Park and the Paddington underground station. It was very quiet and yet had loads of lovely restaurants nearby. The breakfast room was pleasant and the choice of food was good and fresh. We were able to pay for 3 days of breakfast up front for a discount. 
The room was adequate, with a TV, Fridge, a good shower and good storage. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.

I have mentioned this, but is definately not a deal breaker, it is more for the hotel management......'The bar/lounge wasn't very inviting. I think a few comfy chairs to sit in instead of the haphazard tables might be a good idea. They had a TV in the room, but we didn't feel like sitting in there'.

We would stay again for the great location, comfortable room and polite, but approachable staff.",5,2024,06,18
103,Under whelming,"This is a busy popular hotel in a good location in Paddington. I had a basement room which was spacious and the bed was comfy. However  the air con didn’t work properly which made for a restless nights sleep, there is a strange smell in the corridors (not a horrible one but like cheap air freshener) and I found the whole place in need of some upkeep and largely under whelming. Didn’t bother with breakfast so can’t comment. Would I stay again - maybe buy wouldn’t purposely look for availability.   I won’t say this was 4 star either.",3,2024,06,18
103,Great hotel!,"Amazing, great hotel, welcoming staff.

Warm room, comfy bed, this hotel is worth every penny. Great location

Love London and will be staying again

I am getting used to this Tripadvisor now

We will all be booking again soon I promise

Now back to Manchester back to work and back to kids 😭",5,2024,06,14
103,We loved staying at the Park Grand!,"The staff was professional and friendly.  The check in team dealt very patiently with a ""difficult"" customer who arrived just before we checked in.  The hotel was one of the cleanest we have ever been in.  It is in an old building but everything has been renovated beautifully.  Our only complaint was the pigeons cooing outside our window (Lol) and the hotel and done their best to dissuade the birds from roosting.  The breakfast was very good and the servers worked quickly and efficiently.  The location was perfect, in a beautiful part of London but without the hustle and bustle you would expect in a busy city.",5,2024,06,13
103,Hotel nice staff nice,"Hotel was nice room and clean but we stayed in room 418 which had an air conditioning unit which made a humming noise all night keeping us awake very annoying , otherwise the  overall stay was pleasant enough staff are friendly, leaving luggage with them was no problem either",1,2024,06,09
103,Overload on cheap air fresheners,"We booked this hotel based on the fact it was reasonable rated on tripadvisor and close to Hyde park.
We booked a club double as we wanted to have the top room for a special weekend. When we were arrived it was clear the professional photos make the hotel look a lot better than it really is.
We arrived a little early and a room wasn’t available. Moments later he said he could “upgrade” us to a larger triple room. Given we were a couple this wasn’t really necessary but we took it. The room was 554 and that turned out to be in the building across the road in the basement. The first thing was the overwhelming air freshener smell and the cleaners were spraying it all around the basement. There were no windows that opened and the windows were backing onto air conditioning system so a bad view. The walls had wet patches so the air freshener was to cover up damp smells. My husband compared the quality of the room to what he would usually have on a stag do, which says a lot.
We went back to the lobby and said we weren’t happy with the upgrade and wanted the club room. We got moved to a club twin, whilst not ideal as we had booked a double, but was better than what we had. It actually looked like a proper hotel room for a start although I wouldn’t say it was 4*. There was a box of coffee chocolate (who eats coffee chocolate? - you could tell this was a cheap give away) and a small bottle of white wine. There were actually amenities in the bathroom such as toothbrushes etc which the triple “upgrade” didn’t have. 
The problem then came at night as this room had a light air freshener smell but I thought it would dissipate. However, over night it didn’t and I ended up waking up feeling poorly and it turned out there was a febreze air freshener under my bedside table whacked up to nearly full release. What hotel needs to rely on cheap air freshener?!? So many people cannot tolerate it and it’s not good inhaling this so much! 
We had breakfast included but I didn’t bother going because given everything it was unlikely to be good!",1,2024,06,09
103,Not 4 star hotel,"We stayed in a room with 2 twin beds. The room was big enough for just the beds. Nowhere to put your suitcases so they would be sitting in the walkway of the room and you would have to step over them. The beds were worn on the sides so you would feel like you were going to roll off. The air unit...awful. You need to put your key in the wall to turn it on. When you'd get back to the room, it took forever to cool it down. In the middle of the night, it would turn off and it would be hot and stuffy during the night and while getting ready in the morning. Hallways are tight as well.  The bar was never open on the 4 nights we were there. Camlin (his name sounds like this) was beyond friendly from the front desk and even remembered us when we checked out. Others we encountered at the desk was not friendly or helpful. 
PROS: The hotel was clean. It was a 10 minute walk from Paddington Station . 
Overall, not a comfortable hotel and we would not stay here again. Moving on in our trip and getting to a new hotel was a breath of fresh air. Giving it 3 stars was really being generous.",3,2024,06,08
103,Good location to Paddington,"Booked this hotel for location and the excellent price I had through Agoda.
We booked the double deluxe. I dread to think how small the ordinary rooms are. The room was tiny with absolutely no room on the window side of the bed.
On arrival at the hotel we were told we were in the building opposite.!
It was a basement room and I wasn’t too amused.
The room it self 556 did have a window thank goodness.
Very clean though and everything you needed also very quite.
Downside no WIFI signal whatsoever.
We wanted to use the bar in the hotel but on both occasions no bar staff and reception was extremely busy so we weren’t hanging around.
Glad we didn’t book breakfast as I like to take breakfast in the building I’m sleeping in.
Would only stay here again if I had it in the same price range that I paid. If I had the hotel price I would have been very disappointed.
The staff we met were lovely and we loved the area.",3,2024,06,08
103,Adequate  hotel.,"Adequate hotel  but  not  4  star.  Had  to  upgrade  to a  bigger  room as  the  compact  double  did,nt  cut  it. Staff were  great  . Our  stay  was  just  okay. Good  for  Paddington  area  and  Hyde  park. Would  stay  here  again . But  would  reserve  the Club double  room. 3  stars  from  me .",3,2024,06,06
103,Amazing experience,"This hotel is lovely,  the gentleman on checkin reception friday 31st may and sat 1st June was so helpful , made it a lovely stay , room was lovely , clean , mini bar good, we stayed for one night and reception was outstanding got us a taxi quick so we got to theatre on time . Location is brilliant close to paddington tube . Highly recommend",5,2024,06,02
103,Stay at park grand,"Maisum, Kazi and Ali were very good with us! We had an amazing time. If you planning to stay for a long time with your coupenbe sure to ask for a room with more space because the smallest is compact. The room service is good and fast also. The ubication is alos very good.",5,2024,05,27
103,Great stay,Stayed for 1 night in a quad room. We were met with a warm smiling welcome by reception staff and the room (406) was wonderful. We were visiting the Chelsea flower show and staff stored our luggage at no extra charge for the day. Breakfast was good and all the staff were lovely. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.,5,2024,05,25
103,Nice choice for London travellers,"Stayed here 2 nights with my school group. The hotel was clean and well-kempt and had a convenient location within walking distance to the Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations. The room was not much of note, stayed in twin bed, decent enough for a  petite student such as myself, though I reckon larger folks may want a bigger bed, and had usb ports to charge my phone. Comfy mattress, slept like a baby. Only downside was the breakfast not complimentary but this is not a chain like a holiday inn or marriott I would be accustomed to back home.",4,2024,05,23
103,London trip,"I absolutely recomend this hotel. Ali 
Shuja and Kazi Riham are great. The accommodation is great, close to Hjde Park. the rooms are neat and clean. The hotel is near to Bucking ham palace and also near to paddington station. We will come back again with our friends.",5,2024,05,19
103,Clean. Good location.,"Stayed 1 night in London at one of the street level suites across from the room, advised on check in this was a free upgrade. The room was larger as it was wheelchair friendly, everything was clean and well maintained. Stayed two 2 nights at the end of our stay in UK and ended up in a room in the basement. Again the room was clean but a little cramped. ( Not uncommon in London ) A bit of a maze to get to with very narrow hallways so may not be good for somebody who is claustrophobic. One small issue was they did not a a plug in near the mirror, which was a bit of an issue for my partner getting ready in the morning. An 8 minute walk from Paddington Station so easy to catch the London Express from airport. Bar was pretty basic in the hotel so did not use and also did not use restaurant.",3,2024,05,18
103,Very poor hotel,"This hotel was way overpriced and in addition a group of us booked this hotel to be together for the London marathon and then most were moved with 2 days notice to an alternative hotel due to double booking, ruining our experience. The rooms were small and the check in and out process lengthy. I was also charged more than I was quoted. This was a truly terrible stay",1,2024,05,13
103,Pictures from hotel do not do it justice! False advertising!,"Completely oversold room! I had a so called “deluxe” room, which was a 12sqm room located underground, with a tiny bed (75cm wide). Took over one hour to check-in due to hotel not being able to verify the currency exchange from Booking.com. Then got keys that didn’t work twice. 
Will not be staying here again!",1,2024,05,10
103,No way this is a 4 star hotel,"The location and staff are great, but this hotel is definitely not 4 star. Perhaps a 2.5. 
The main complaint I have is the room size and layout. I have stayed in many micro-hotels, and they are generally well laid out. This room was not. I dreaded going back to the room each night. Tip - spend a bit more, and get a better hotel.",2,2024,05,02
103,Good location and good value.,"This hotel is located in a pleasant neighbourhood and is surprisingly quiet. It is just a few minutes walk from Paddington station and therefore ideal if you are coming by train from Heathrow. Friendly staff. Good value for London. Our room was very small, but other than that everything was fine.",4,2024,04,20
103,Never again!,"We booked with this hotel for our first trip to London. My husband reached out about the easiest transportation from Heathrow. We received an email, THANKING US FOR OUR RESERVATION, and giving feedback. When we arrived at the hotel, we were abruptly told by the front desk staff that there was no reservation. My husband showed the email and was told that he hadn't finalized our reservation?!?! He then asked if he could fix it at the desk and was told that he would have to do it on his phone and was asked to step aside. The website was horrible and the reservation couldn't be finalized, despite three members of our party trying. The front desk staff again refused to help! We were able to book a reservation on booking.com for Park Grand Kensington, which is reviewed separately. Our recommendation would be to avoid both of these hotels.",1,2024,04,16
103,"Excellent value for money, especially for central London. 5*","Excellent stay. I stayed in a single room. The bed was very comfortable, the room was quiet and clean. With a fridge, microwave, tea + coffee, large tv and a fantastic shower. Easy and friendly check in, great facilities (restaurant, room service, gym etc). Under 10mins walk to Paddington station. Local shops, restaurants and transport options. Highly recommended and excellent value for money, especially for central London. 5*",5,2024,04,11
103,Ordinary place to stay,"I booked this place based on the reviews. My experience was substandard. It is run down and needs a refurbishment. The room I booked wasn’t the room I got until I complained. They had put me down the end of a corridor, more like a rabbit Warren with a generator right outside my window. They have a series of different places around the main site where you could end up. Thankfully after I complained, they put me something that was satisfactory for the night. The breakfast is in the lower ground and pretty ordinary. It was my only night in London and I’d paid a decent amount for this hotel & I wished I’d booked elsewhere. They were however proactive in sorting out my complaint. It is London, so I suppose this is the quality you get for a large price.",3,2024,04,10
103,Average (and a bit odd),"Not having stayed in a central London hotel for many years I was unsure what my expectations should be. This place had a good TA score (albeit thanks to a large number of glowing reports from one-time reviewers), it was relatively cheap and also handy for Paddington station, so seemed pretty ideal.

Arrival was a bit of a disappointment as our room wasn`t ready at 3.20 and we were asked to wait for 20 minutes as our accommodation needed a “final inspection”. I didn`t take up the offer of waiting in the bar (hidden behind a side door) as I couldn`t trust that we wouldn`t be forgotten about. Hanging around the Reception area appeared to do the trick as within a few minutes we were allocated a room, although this turned out to be in the Annex, a building across the road which is apparently also owned by the hotel. 

Now this became all a bit odd. The Annex was like a rabbit warren and absolutely reeked of plug-in air freshener. Our room turned out to be the furthest away from the front door in the attic at the top of a small staircase. The room was a decent size (supposedly a `Club` room), but the bathroom was the smallest I had ever seen. I wouldn`t have thought it possible to fit a shower, toilet and sink into such a tiny space, but somehow, they managed it; I guess on the assumption that their guests would be no larger than medium sized. Some of the towels were almost see-through, with the texture of a Ryvita. On the plus side we did have a view of sorts and the room was comfortable and very quiet. Housekeeping was OK, but they seemed to treat supplies of tea, coffee etc as personal possessions so reluctant did they appear to want to part with any. 

Breakfast in the main hotel (remember to take an umbrella if it`s raining) was in a cramped basement room - you`ll need to ask for the location on the first morning as they seem to like to keep it secret. Service was efficient and polite however. Food choice was satisfactory if not wide-ranging.

All-in-all it was probably worth what we paid given that it`s a London hotel, but honestly I wish I had upped the budget and stayed elsewhere (if only for the pleasure of having a human-size bathroom).",3,2024,04,08
103,Special Stay - they went the extra mile!,"We can't say enough about our visit!  We arrived and were surprised when we go to your room.  I had mentioned that it was my husband's birthday and our 11th anniversary.  We had champagne, roses, and wonderful chocolate!  We thank Petronela and all involved for making this a very special stay!",5,2024,04,06
103,Really nice hotel,"This is a really nice hotel at a reasonable price. The rooms are quite plush and really functional. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was great with lots of choices. It all felt 4 star. I booked through Adobe who were useless, but I could not fault the hotel. All in all very good!",5,2024,04,05
103,Disappointing Experience,"Location: It is at a six-minute walking distance from the Paddington underground station. The tricky part is the hotel also owns many other properties on the same lane and the other side too. You must clarify with the booking team which building are they allocating you for the booking. We were at first given the option of staying at a room in the other lane and then I insisted on the room of the booked building. So be clear with the idea of the location of the building before confirming your stay.
Room: We were given an attic room for our parents, they had upgraded the room and we were provided with complimentary wine and chocolates. It was really a warm gesture and we appreciate it howsoever, it would be advisable if they could clarify the location being an attic room without a lift for that particular building, we had to access the lift from a different building and had to climb a flight of very small stairs to reach the room. It would be perfectly fine by us and even adventures but this room is not recommended for families or elderly people. The room was spacious, the washroom was incredibly small and the heater did not work for a while.
Staff: Our booking was for two nights and on the first night I was adamant about cancelling. I had booked via third-party Agoda and their customer service could not provide me with any help. Hence, I headed down to the reception and informed him of the lack of heating in the room. He patiently understood our problem and provided us with a heater and then even secured a warm blanket for my parents. His gestures throughout our stay were very cordial and helpful, my parents were staying all alone and his hospitality made their stay comfortable. He helped my father navigate his way back to the room which was rather confusing and assisted him with every query. Truly sometimes even though a property disappoints you, it is the behaviour of the staff that reminds you of the joy of going on a vacation.
I truly wish I could find a room in the main building, however, I think finding a booking in the main building will remain a challenge for people from my nation. It is a great hotel with various branches of building, but I would not recommend anyone to stay without being properly informed of the rooms. I am thankful to the night manager for turning my otherwise disappointing experience into this incident that I can recall with a laugh later. His behavior assured me that humanity still exists.",3,2024,03,28
103,No refund 1 hour after booking for an 11-year old boy,"My 11 year old son saved his money for years to see his favorite football team play.  We found an away game and eagerly booked this hotel together for his trip, non-refundable rate as it was what he could afford. 

1 hour later we learned the the football tickets didn’t go through.  I called the hotel to ask for a refund and a nice girl said, of course we can just have the third party travel agent contact us. 

I called Expedia and explained. They said hold while we call, came back and reported “no answer” then said give us 72 hours to try to reach them.  72 hours later they reported “no answer, no refund”. 

I called the hotel, learned I need to speak with specific “reservations” people who told me “no refund” and don’t believe I called 1 hour later on the same day of booking and had no record of Expedia contacting them.  Called Expedia and they had the wrong email address. They forwarded the time stamped emails to the hotel and asked for a refund and the hotel said NO!

My son lost €500 that he saved over 2 years to see Manchester City play.  The hotel thought I was lying, they were rude and harsh and have no grace.  

Corporate greed at it’s finest.",1,2024,03,27
103,Decent hotel close to Paddington station,"Somewhat worn down hotel, but the rooms are nice and clean. But very small rooms. Double room has bed + 1 tiny work desk with small stool, instead of real chair. No other space.
Lack of warm water first day was not so pleasant, having to take a cold shower after long trip.
Grocery shops nearby for drinks and snacks.",4,2024,03,22
103,Avoid this hotel,"Unclean. Hairs in the ‘fresh bedding’. And two bugs in my room - when reporting to reception this morning it was suggested perhaps I brought them with me in my suitcase. Unprofessional and unkind. Breakfast staff rude and obtrusive. Pay £162 per night but pay an extra £5 for a cooked (but dry!) breakfast. Continental breakfast offering very poor. 

Very low standard for a 4 star hotel.",1,2024,03,21
103,Faulty Towers number 2,"Having looked on Tripadvisor and the hotel,website I was looking forwards to staying at this hotel, as I come down to London 4-6 times a year for work purposes.
The initial room was clearly a compact room and I was expecting to be in a deluxe room, or mid of the range of rooms for this establishment. Neither room reflected the standard -portrayed by the hotel, during check in the staff were busy chatting away in a language I did not understand accompanied with skyward glances, so I was obviously an inconvenience to them, or that’s how I felt.
Also during check in the process was different for different members of my group, some asked for ID, some not, those who were asked some had their ID ‘scanned’ some didn’t, some were asked for a credit card to be logged some were not.
The room itself was compact, although not as compact as the first one, the bed was comfortable and I slept really well, despite having a Red light shining brightly in the room.
Breakfast was an experience, and I was informed if I wanted a cooked breakfast it would be £5 extra, I didn’t have the funds and on principal didn’t think it was made clear enough at the point of booking that, breakfast, was continental only included in the room price, as my organisation would not have made the booking.
 Altogether it had a feeling of staying at Faulty Towers not a reputable London Hotel.",2,2024,03,21
103,Won’t stay again,"Arrived to find the hotel in chaos, they had over booked rooms and were sending people to sister hotels. I was given a room which was ok except that several huge air conditioning unit directly outside the window. The noise from these was significant.
They wouldn’t/couldn’t move me because of the over booking. Terrible night, no sleep.
Breakfast was disappointing. The cooked breakfast was cool but we were told that we could have it freshly cooked if we paid an additional £5. I would expect breakfast to be freshly cooked as a minimum standard.
Second day moved to a better room and no problems with the room. However told I could only have continental breakfast despite the booking paying for full breakfast and again informed we could have a full breakfast if we paid an additional £5 again!",2,2024,03,21
103,You have caused horrible distress. Sort this out.,"Appalling. The worst experience of my life, in and out of a hotel. 

I have never been so frightened in my life.

My friend and I arrived at nine last night to find a long queue of people ahead of us who were being sent to hotels elsewhere. 

I have Autism. And after a difficult journey back from Paris needed a safe and reliable space to decompress and sleep. 

The two reception staff did not understand us and requested our passports. They claimed they couldn’t find our booking on the system. 

Upon hearing this I fell apart. We were then told to wait. Whilst one of the desk staff sent others elsewhere, who were less than happy. The other receptionist was on their phone. 

We were then asked if we could go to the opposite hotel.

Finally we were given two basement rooms, which were tiny and freezing cold. 

Teeny minutes later my door hand buzzed and another woman entered my room and screamed. 

She had been allocated my room after I had been there for 20 minutes already. We promptly packed up our things and headed out of the hotel in complete distress. 

Upon telling the staff what had happened on our way out. We were told it was ‘drunks misbehaving’ and nothing to do with the staff.

A shocking and appalling experience, we expect FULL compensation and nothing less.

The distress you caused has made me no longer want to travel, let alone to London. You have lied to us. And given me a great feeling of mistrust towards any hotel. Let alone your own ‘chain.’",1,2024,03,20
103,"Nice position , bad room","Very small room which is unfortunately a typical London standard but the rooms located in the basement floor are very bad with small windows with zero view (wall-view).
Cleaning is not good and there was dust everyqhere.

Very good location and kind staff.",3,2024,03,04
103,London and Paris in the Fall 2023,"My brother and I were first time visitors to London in Sept-Oct 2023. We stayed at the Park Grand at Paddington for a few days, then traveled to Paris for a few days. Upon our return to London, we again went to the Park Grand to spend the last couple of days of our trip. We were very comfortable in our room pre-Paris, altho the room was very small, but that was somewhat expected. After all, you don't come to London to spend time in a hotel. However, I did ask the receptionist if, when we returned from Paris, we might be placed in any room that might be available that was larger. When we returned, we were pleasantly surprised that our room was a good deal larger. 

My commendations for the wonderful staff (Anahi, Kazi, Rhian, Petronela, Cosmin), and a very attentive housekeeping crew, for a very enjoyable stay!

103,Average hotel- noisy,"Arrived at the hotel to find they had no record of my reservation. After 10minutes showing them ID my booking confirmation and having the clerk even forward my confirmation to his main office while he was on the phone to them,  I was told to sit and wait in the lobby while they sorted it. Half hour later nothing so I had to ask again and was put through the same routine- so nobody had done anything and just forgotten about me! what on earth was going on. Was a few people there with same issue it seams. Finally given  room. I booked a deluxe- room was ok. They are small- 1 person is ok- 2 people would be a squeeze. 

Biggest complaint for me is the noise. The corridors are tiny and rooms have no sound proofing so you can hear other rooms, conversations and everything, same with the windows which you have the joy of hearing staff emptying rubbish into bins. I did complain but they wouldn’t move me.  They all appear to have adjoining doors so the sound really travels. Other reviewers I’m suspicious of and may be their friends as the hotel is not that great.

 Overall a not so pleasant stay and won’t be returning.",3,2024,02,23
103,Excellent. Well recommended!,An excellent hotel. The room had everything you could wish for. Iron safe hairdryer toiletries and most important - plenty of sockets. Well situated a short walk from Paddington Station. All the staff were pleasant and very helpful indeed,5,2024,02,17
103,"Excellent, would definitely stay again","Execllent, our host Rhian provided immaculate service, with a free room upgrade, decoration, and bottle of Prosecco for us upon arrival. The room was lovely and great value for money, with a large comfortable bed and air conditioning, the tv had easy access to external devices (using the fire stick) so we could watch our own programs. The bathroom was lovely too, with a great shower and in pristine condition.",5,2024,02,14
103,Excellent hotel and staff,"Hotel was immaculately clean.  Staff were excellent, very welcoming and helpful
Room was compact but had everything needed for a four night stay.

Will certainly use hotel again.",5,2024,02,10
103,Park grand,"This hotel was perfect for my staying in London. Hotel manager Colston and Shuja saved my life , I did mistake and did a new reservation and help me to sort out the issue promptly.

103,Tarnished experience,"Room 557 

The hotel's location, within a 10-minute walk to Paddington tube station and surrounded by various dining options, was a positive aspect. However, several disappointments marred the experience. The room remained uncomfortably cold despite the air conditioning set to 28°C, resulting in a chilly night's sleep. The presence of pubic hair in the shower tray and curdled milk pots for tea and coffee added to the list of grievances. Additionally, an unpleasant smell of cigarette smoke infiltrated the room around 7 am from staff outside.

While the room rate of just over £70 in London might justify overlooking some issues, a significant incident marred the stay. Personal belongings, including two bottles of wine placed outside the window to cool due to the lack of room fridges, were stolen. Despite confronting two staff members and suspicions pointing to them, no concrete proof could be established. The hotel's response, providing a complimentary bottle of Prosecco, was appreciated but did little to restore a sense of security, leaving a lingering feeling of discomfort and unease.",2,2024,01,19

We checked in and were given an upgrade to a club room which was really nice of them. The room was downstairs through winding corridors and was absolutely spotless and had plenty of room. Bed was nice and comfy and the towels were nice and soft. Tea  and coffee making facilities were in the room also as well as some nice toiletries. We didn’t have the breakfast because we’re not big eaters in the morning. Perfectly located for Hyde park, Paddington station and Oxford Street and we walked to most places we love a walk round London. There’s lots of places to eat around as well and plenty of pubs. Parking is available but it’s public parking . We will definitely stay here again it’s perfect!",5,2024,01,03

103,Average stay in a convenient location,"We stayed here as a family of 5. 
Very convenient location and it was easy to find. 

We had 2 rooms, one had a double bed the other a king bed and a stained broken sofa bed. Showers weren't in great condition and there were broken tiles in the shower room. 

For the money we spent, it wasn't too bad. This is a 3 star hotel...... with a fancy lighting system in the rooms. Unfortunately it doesn't cover over the lack of 4 star amenities. 

If you want a clean convenient stay, it's great. Not suitable for families.",3,2023,12,24

103,Not impressed,"The hotel did not live to our expectations of a 4-star hotel. We arrived early before the check in was open and had to leave our luggage and return back in the evening. To our surprise, there were no rooms available in the main building and we were offered a room just opposite in Devonshire building. I would say, avoid to go there, if you can. We booked a compact double room, so understood that the room would not be very spacious. But what we had was beyond belief. You cannot even fully open the bathroom door and had to squeeze in there between the bed and the door. The room was cold and uninviting. Even when you put the heat on, it remained cold. The walls in the bathroom constantly had some condensate on leaking towards the floor. The shelf under the basin was full of water because of either a leakage or condensate. The telephone was not working and we went to the reception to complain. The supervisor was called in but regretfully they could not rectify the situation for this night but promised to relocate us for our second night. They did it next day and I have to say the room in the main building was better, although still small with a huge bed you can hardly walk around. The bathroom was ok and the only downside here was the lack of working sockets for charging the devices. The staff was polite. But the hotel management had to work on the rooms in Devonshire building to make them more habitable.",3,2023,12,08
103,Excellent service,"Staff are very friendly, extremely helpful.  Location is excellent, close to train/tube. Price is good and competitive. Although the room we stayed in is a little small, it is however very clean, facilities are all in good working order",5,2023,12,06

103,Definitely NOT 4 stars,"The location is really good very close to Paddington station. The staff were not helpful or professional at all. When arriving we asked could they take our bags, we were told a member of staff would be right with us. Two other couples got their bags looked after we asked and we were still waiting. The rooms do not look like the photos they are much smaller. We had to switch rooms as the first one had fans or something like that right outside the window and the noise was outrageous (Room 221). We got moved the another room with was still small but better then the first. We also had to go down and ask for the heating to be turned on in the room. When booking a taxi at the airport we had to repeat that we wanted to pay with card a numerous amount of times. And when the taxi did arrive it was a white ford focus with an exhaust done? And no ID on the driver so they don’t use a professional taxi service and still ended up going to an ATM as the taxi didn’t take card. So we were 20 mins behind for the airport. Also the bar is pathetic, looks NOTHING like the photos. We had a broken socket in the room and only 2 sockets available at the other side of the room. This hotel is definitely not 4 stars. They got their 4 star status from AA and that’s all they had present in the hotel.",2,2023,11,27

Nonetheless the hotel location is perfectly located close to Paddington station and we have enjoyed all the amenities provided in the room.

Wonderful stay in London! Definitely will some back here the next time! ",5,2023,11,22
103,Avoid,"The room was fine, comfy bed and had everything you needed.

The issue has been the service and deposit. Upon check in you are asked to leave a deposit for each night of your stay which is then refunded after check out. I personally have never had to pay a deposit to a hotel upon check in when the full amount for the stay has been paid in advance (not stated as far as I know in confirmation of booking) but whatever, no problem. It's three weeks later, many calls, emails and messages and I still haven't received my deposit back. Keep getting told it will be returned but doesn't and no one seems to be bothered. 

I won't be staying again and here's to praying this review will help refund my money.

Purely based on this nightmare alone I wouldn't recommend. Not worth it.",1,2023,11,22
103,Nice trip ,"It was nice. We spent 4 days in London and the hotel was in great position, near the Paddington Train Station. The people in the hotel were very kind. Breakfast was great and very good. We’d like to coming back. Kazi Shuya was nice ",5,2023,11,22
103,"A lovely Hotel, close to Paddington station","The room was lovely and clean with a large window, also close to Paddington Station. However, the room I was first allocated with an upgrade, didn't have a window and I'm claustrophobic. I rang to reception and they quickly relocated me to a double room with window. The room size was fine for me but might have struggled if there were two of us - it had all that was needed and the shower room was brilliant. The bed was comfortable. There was an iron and ironing board, safe, fridge, hairdryer, water supplied and teas and coffees, also wine glasses.  My key didn't initially work the door from outside as I was in a room opposite the main hotel but the night porter sorted this quickly. Breakfast was standard to most hotels and buffet style. Reception were friendly and helpful . However, I would suggest that when booking rooms you request a window if like me its needed. ",4,2023,11,20
103,Great Location and Service,"Tremendous help from Staff, particularly by a gentleman named Kazi who sorted everything out for my aged parents - including helping with heaving heavy suitcases, allocating rooms accessible via lift, the occasional timely room service and overall making our stay very comfortable. Thank you again Mr. Kazi and Park Grand Paddington Court",5,2023,11,19
103,Great stay near Hyde Park,"Lovely stay at Paddington Court. Prosecco, chocolate and Rose petals left in the room for our anniversary! Lovely touch. Nothing too much trouble. Friendly staff.

Room are nice and small but more than  enoght to have a good sleep !",5,2023,11,16
103,The highlight of my stay was the people. The amenities were also better than I expected.,"All the people who work here were unfailingly helpful and kind to me. In particular. Kazi went out of his way to make me feel welcome. He explained the Hop-on Hop-off tour bus experience but did not pressure me to buy. When I found out no elevator went to my room, he suggested I could change rooms, although I decided not to. 

Sebi in the bar and the men at breakfast were very friendly and remembered me each day. At the front desk, Andrea, Maithele and Shuja were professional and hospitable.",5,2023,11,15
103,Andreea ,"Would just like to start with saying that the location of the hotel is so comfortable to get around and see London 
I had such an amazing experience at the hotel overall, but I must say that it was mostly thanks to Andreea who has helped me and suggested to upgrade to a suit as it was mine and my boyfriends anniversary and I am so happy I took her advice. 
Our whole experience was absolutely beautiful and will definitely be a memorable anniversary.
Thank you Andreea for being so amazing with us and I would recommend 10000% ",5,2023,11,12

Its definitly a Place to Go in a couple 

Thanks to Rhian and Maithlee ",5,2023,11,10
103,An Excellent 2 Night Stay,"Had a brilliant two nights stay - the 2 rooms we booked rooms were perfect and spotlessly clean. The staff could not have been more helpful.  The Park Grand enjoys a really good location, just a 5 minute walk to Paddington Underground and 8 minutes away from Paddington Station's car park.",5,2023,11,09
103,Disappointed,"Stayed for two nights for a shopping trip to London, would not come back. 

1) Two nights before arrival 163£ was withdrawn from my card i was using when i booked the room. Didn’t think much of it other than maybe it would be counted off the total ammount. At arrival i was charged the full ammount of 335£. Asked reception at checkin what the 163£ was charged for, and he said ”hmm maybe it’s a security deposit, i THINK you’ll get it back after checkout”. I booked thru hotels.com and they did not state anything about a security deposit, and the official hotel website states 50£ per night so why was i charged 163£ when we only stayed for two? Haven’t gotten my money back yet, tho it’s only been three business days. 
2) Got a damp room in the basement who constantly smelled like chlorine.
3) Fire alarm went off at 4:15 am for a minute then silent, obv no fire.
4) Breakfast was moderate with very limited selection, awful coffee.

The only upside i would say is that the breakfast staff was friendly and the girl at checkout. ",2,2023,11,08
103,3 day stay with friends ,"Fantastic experience! Stayed at the hotel with some friends for 3 nights. The service was 5 star!! We where received for our Check in by Andreea who was absolutely amazing, extremely professional and kind. She even helped us with planning day trips and gave us advice on getting around the city which was extremely helpful and made for a great holiday. The rooms are nice and extremely clean and the food is excellent.",5,2023,11,08
103,Wonderful Experience ,Very welcoming experience from my first step inside until my last step leaving. Kazi was extremely helpful with the guiding and planning of my daily activities. The hotel was clean and it had friendly environment. The bed was very comfortable and the breakfast buffet tasted great and had many options. I would definitely return and recommend to all of my friends and family.,5,2023,11,07
103,Excellent option in Paddington,"I chose the PGPC based on previous reviews and its proximity to Paddington station, I stayed for 10 nights. He delivered what I expected.
I stayed in a single room, a little cramped, but it did what was needed, I felt comfortable. I particularly liked the bathroom, modern and very functional. Cleanliness was also a strong point. 
Very tasty English breakfast, not the variety we Brazilians are used to have, but everything was very tasty, the service provided by the cafe staff was 10.
Another point that was excellent, I arrived around 12:00 and the room was released for use immediately, after a flight straight away, nothing better. I cannot forget the service provided by Mr. Kazi, who helped me choose a tour. 
Great location, a short walk to the main bus stops and tube stations and Hyde Park. Good conveniences nearby and restaurants, I particularly liked two Italian cuisine nearby, Bizzarro Ristorante (my favorite) and Ristorante Taormina, excellent atmosphere, service and food, both.
On my next trip to London, I will probably stay at PGPC again. I really liked it",5,2023,11,06
103,Nice service,"5 star service.    
I always choose this  hotel for my bussines  trip,  it’s near to station , and Hyde park, close to Oxford ! I really like this area ! Hotel its quiet and big enough , maybe small rooms but for 1/2 days its okay! 
Just want to thanks  to Andreea and ANahi two nicest girl from front desk!",5,2023,11,02
103,Worst customer service experience EVER,"I have booked this hotel as my wife and mother in law were attending a creative writing course and wanted somewhere close to the event.  We had the added reassurance that it was a 4 star. 

Well lets begin by on first glance maybe a 2/3 star and then after the experience it goes down to maybe half a star.  My wife arrived and they were asked if they would like to book breakfast.  We had assumed a continently breakfast was included as it states on their site but it was not.

We did book through booking.com but it doesn't say you have to book direct with the hotel it just says with your stay.

I called up and spoke to a person that could not understand me so they decided to hang up.  I called again and spoke to someone and due to being hung up on I decided to ask for a manager to discuss.  A manager came to the phone and asked what the problem was.  I explained someone had hung up on me and he replied ok so what's the problem.  I explained that what had happened again to be greeted with so how can I help.

Trying to explain that someone had hung up on my and then tried to explain about the breakfast  this manager also just hung up on me.

I called again and the phone was picked up and then put down again.  I tried and tried again to get through and the same thing happened 12 more times.

Eventually I called hiding my number and they answered, I explained the whole thing again and they once again asked me how could they help and what was the problem (sounds like its normal service to hang up on customers)  Eventually they said that they could not spend all day chatting to me as they had other customers to deal with and eventually hung up again.

I explained it all to my wife who was staying there and she said that she wanted to go down and explain to them that the room stank of cleaning products so badly it was over powering but given the treatment I got for wanting to discuss breakfast she did not have the faith they would do anything about it.

I called again after my wife left and asked to speak to the general manager.  A man came on the phone who claimed to be the GM (but given I had already been passed to a DM when asking before I was not sure) I explained the issue and I got the response as of before which was ok so how can i help as if there was no issue with staff being rude or hanging up.

To this day we still have not spoken to anyone that understands the issue or does anything other than hang up the phone on you.    To rate this a 4* would be an insult and I would avoid like the plague.  It may have started as a simple conversation to establish breakfast but turned in to a horrific customer service experience with a room that stunk so badly of cleaning products it was unbearable.",1,2023,11,01

103,Do yourself a favour and stay somewhere else,"Not sure why this place gets so many good reviews, it is a terrible hotel. The one positive thing is the location, convenient to the tube while being in a quiet area. The bad is horrible, rooms are tiny, I booked the deluxe but could bearly get out of the tiny bed, can't honestly believe there is a smaller room, god love whomever stays there. The breakfast room has the smell of raw sewage at one end, not that you'll be back for the breakfast after one look at their scrambled eggs.  The staff are generaly plesant, but the night staff can be rude. the room is loud.....ac, fridge, extractor fan and window all rattle.  Housekeeping sometimes didn't replace dirty cups or refresh tea/coffee.  The place was just dirty.",1,2023,10,22
103,Great stay close to Paddington station,"Our stay was excellent! It is very close to Paddington station which makes it very convenient to travel around London. We easily made it to Wembley stadium, Richmond, and took trains to Oxford, Dover, and Edinburgh. There are great restaurants and pubs nearby and Hyde park is very close as well. The room was very clean and the staff were friendly. We were able to leave our bags on the day of checkout while we waited for our train so that we could take full advantage of the few hours to do some more visiting more easily. Highly recommended and would stay again!",5,2023,10,22

103,Great stay,"Stayed here last night, overnight trip for Madonna gig. There was a little confusion over the booking when we checked in however the reception staff were very apologetic and gave us a larger room for the trouble which was minimal. The room was very nice, decent size, clean and comfortable, absolutely no complaints. We hadn’t pre booked breakfast but we ordered it upon check in and for £12 it was very nice, again no complaints here. The staff were very friendly and polite so all in all a very good stay, would definitely recommend.",4,2023,10,18
103,Comfortable & Easy Walk from Train Station,"We were here for two nights and stayed in room 220. We received a friendly welcome, and the room was ready when we arrived at 11:30 a.m. which was nice after traveling a long way.

The room was cosy and manageable with no wasted space. There was a television, kettle, two glasses and tea. It was a shower only bathroom with radiant heat in the floor The bed was a double and was fine for the two of us. There was no view of any type except for the building air-conditioning units.

The continental breakfast was plentiful with many choices. It got crowded but the staff were efficient at moving people through.

The hotel is a short walk from Paddington Station, and there are many good restaurants nearby. Kensington Gardens is also easily accessible.

The only negative was that we asked them not to clean our room and we turned on the do not disturb sign when we went out. When we came back they had gone into the room, cleaned it, and turned off the sign. It was a frustrating experience but not terrible.",4,2023,10,14
103,Wonderful experience!,"Ther were 20 people in my travel group. The Hotel that we booked closed 1 week before we arrived, and we were not notified.

103,Confusion re 2 different names for hotel and poor service on reception,"I booked this hotel under the name of the Devonshire Hotel 3-5 Devonshire hotel, it was NOT listed as the Park Grand ,with the result that I had difficulty finding it! There was nothing outside nos 3-5 Devonshire Terrace instructing guests to go across the road to the Park Grand where the reception was. The doors to nos 3-5 could not be opened so I went to the Park Grand to ask where the Devonshire Hotel was and was told that was it ! Confusing! I pointed this out to the person on reception but he didn't really acknowledge this or explain why the hotel has 2 names!
Later in the eve I wanted to book a cab and went to reception to ask. "" members of staff were on duty, one was busy with guests while the other person was on her computer. I was standing waiting but she didn't acknowledge me or say she'd be with me in a mninute. It was clear that she was eating whilst on duty as she was chewing, not very professional! Before she bothered to see what I wanted my husband had hailed a cab outside so I left",3,2023,10,12
103,Great!!,"Clean cosy room. 
Helped by Anahi, Rhian, Kai, Colston. Very helpful staff. Location is great we had options of trains to take and ir very close to central attractions in London. Theres a big park near by called Hyde Park",5,2023,10,11
103,The perfect location for your stay in London,"We stayed 8 nights and we could not have any complaints about the hotel, the room, the service offered by the staff. The room was very clean, with a nice and modern bathroom. The room might be a little small, but that's the way in Europe. Opt for the Deluxe room, to get a bit more legroom. The breakfast is a must to get a good start for the day: it offers traditional english  food, with a good variety, including large choice of fresh fruits. It is also perfectly located, just north of Hyde Park, close to Paddington station that deserves Heathrow with the Elizabeth Line and another station nearby, Lancaster Gate on the Central Line. On walking distance, you may cross Hyde Park and get to Royal Albert Hall, Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum. Nearby, if you prefer, Harrods is also on this side of the park. From the hotel, Oxford Street is not far away either. Wether on walking or taking the tube, you'll be close of the action of London, and get a very good rest back at your room. Enjoy your stay in London.",5,2023,10,09

When we came back that night , reached out to management, they did nothing. Second day still  no air, it was stifling.

103,"Confusion re  hotel name, therefore difficult to find . Unhelpful receptionist","We booked the hotel under the name of The Devonshire Hotel but when we arrived at nos 1-2 Devonshire Terrace we could not find the reception because it was located across the road in the Park Grand hotel ! There was nothing , to indicate that the Devonshire was part of the Park Grand  Hotel. and there was  nothing outside nos 1-2 redirecting you across the road! We only found out when we went into the Park Grand to ask where the Devonshire  Hotel was !!
We wanted to book a cab to go out in the eve and I went over to reception ( we were staying across the road in the Devonshire part of the hotel ) but when I went to reception where 2 members of staff were on the desk, one was busy with a guest while the other person was busy on her computer ( and apparently eating something as she was chewing whilst using the computer ) She could see I was there but did not acknowledge my presence even to say "" I'll be with you in a minute "". My husband meanwhile had managed to hail a cab outside so I didn't wait any longer. However I thought that this was very rude and bad customer service.

103,Great stay,"Great hotel, rooms perfect, nice bedding. Fridge and satellite tv in room., pleasent staff. Very close by Paddington station and Hyde Park  as i hoped for. Very good stay. Will come back in the future ",5,2023,10,03
103,Very small room but the location is fantastic,"After some research (my wife not me, as I'm too lazy) we booked ourselves into the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel via Booking.com. We looked at the photos on the website and the standard rooms seemed really small. In the pictures you can clearly see the double bed touch 3 walls at the same time.

However, for a few quid more we got the Deluxe Double, which, although still small looking at the photos, it seemed a great deal better than  the standard.

We arrived maybe half a hour before check-in (it's a stone's throw from Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate Tube Station) and were prepared to have to wait, but, no, the very friendly and professional guy at the check-in desk checked us in no issue.

We were assigned a basement room, which was ominous, and when we arrived at our room, we were mildly disappointed with the size, but, as we weren't staying in the room the entire time, nor did we have tons of luggage, it didn't matter too much.

The room was clean(ish), slight mould on some of the silicone in the shower, and the window sill was full of chipped paint. We didn't open the curtains the entire time due to where the room was situated. Anyone on the street outside could see us if they looked slightly down.

Anyway, the room has a mini fridge, which as noisy, so we had to turn it off at night. There's also a microwave, which we didn't use, and also a kettle, iron, hair dryer, and fresh towels daily.

The bed was okay, apart from the edges where if you sat down you were likely to slide off. I think the mattress might have been damaged due to years of use. They sloped and sagged badly if you sat on the edges.

There is also a TV there, but this frequently lost signal, but this wasn't too much of a bother, as we weren't there to watch hours of TV. WiFi is available, but it is so weak and slow, probably due to being a basement room, that it was often useless. I also had huge problems getting a 5G or even 4G signal in that room.

The shower, apart from the slight mould, was actually pretty good with decent pressure from both the standard shower head and the rainfall shower head.

Now, some of this sounds very negative, but, the one greatest attribute that the hotel has (other than friendly staff) is the location. You're literally a short walk from Hyde Park, and from here we were able to walk to The V&A Museum (in maybe 20 minutes) and then onto Harrods (another 15 minutes or so).

There are also buses just down the way which will take you to Central, passed Hamleys and Selfridges and all of those shops, along the way.

You're also a short walk from Queensway and the plethora of restaurants and eateries there, and there are a number of restaurants, cafes, corner shops, and the like much closer to home. Oh, and the place is fairly quiet.

It is a fantastic location, and, perhaps with a slightly better room (in terms of size and floor) I would have scored it higher.

Yes 3/5 seems a harsh, but it isn't, there are many, many positives in favour of the hotel, it's just that some of the negatives let it down a bit.

You should consider this hotel if you're planning a trip.",3,2023,10,03

Kazi, Anahí, Shujan and Rihan were really helpful with checking in and the luggage and gave good recommendation to move around London. ",5,2023,09,29
103,Worst Hotel Ever!!,"THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER!   Would be 0 if an option.  We booked into this hotel for 4 nights after reading the reviews and for it proximity to Paddington Station. We had booked a Club Double and had prepaid with chase Travel. Upon arrival we were assigned a room that upon entering was obviously not a club double. I called down to the desk to tell them and they were to call back. 
Waited 5 minutes and grabbed our bags and carried them back downstairs. 
The fellow that checked us in kept checking his computer and insisted we were assigned the correct room. EXCEPT all the club rooms have a plaque on the outside of the door that says Club Room.  Duh!! Ours did not. 
After arguing he finally said he didn’t have any other rooms but could move us the next day. We went back to that awful 
room. 
The story gets worse. They supply a bath mat rolled up on shower floor. My husband went to use it and it was full of black mold.  No showers for us. 🤮

We went to dinner and returned to the room for a sleep.  At 1am someone tried to break into our room.  At 8 am we checked out. 
I am now trying to get a refund through Chase travel. 

The hotel staff are not truthful. The hotel is run down and disgusting. 
BEWARE of these scammers!!",1,2023,09,29
103,Great stay ,"Room was spacious and beds were comfy. Ana Rhian was very helpful with the check in! 
They look after your stuff while you can travel around before and after check in. 
Lots of supples in the bathroom.",5,2023,09,29
103,Great trip to London,"We were happy with everything. Our room was very good and comfortable. The interior design also lovely of this hotel and traditions in London. There are many local shops and station was near to us. We will come back again.  Specially thanks to Kazi, Shuja,  Colston and Rihan for helping us everything ❤️ ",5,2023,09,25
103,Solo Travel ,"The check in was quick and the room was well maintained. They provide bath ropes and bath mat. There was also a microwave in the room. The staff Rhian, Shuja, Colston & Kazi were helpful. Tukdin is just a short walk away for dearest Malaysians info. Will come back. Good job, team!",5,2023,09,25
103,Excellent location and great staff,"Arrived after a long haul flight to a super welcome room upgrade and early check in. Room was quiet, mattress comfy and shower was hot. Nice and close to Paddington station. Petroiveca (apologies if I’ve misspelt) was extremely helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Would recommend. ",5,2023,09,25
103,This is a clean and fresh hotel,"The room and the hotel areas are fresh and clean.  Nice breakfast for everyone. Very  good service from the staff. Excellent located in a quiet area, near Hyde Park for a nice morning strall. Two underground station nearby the hotel.",4,2023,09,25
103,Not a good experience.,"One of our rooms had a water leak.  They cleaned up the water on the floor and said it was the curtains bringing in the water.  It was clearly coming from the ceiling.  The next day there was more water on the floor.  We were in the basement of the building across the street from the actual hotel.  The hallway had a terrible smell, maybe mold.  We were only staying 2 nights.  Thank Goodness.",2,2023,09,24
103,Location good & quiet area,Stayed for a few nights to see the sights of London. Good location a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station - with the Heathrow Express to Paddington make it very easy. The hotel is in a good location and nice and quiet so you can sleep. It has been converted into a hotel so expect a few strange hallways and stairs to some areas. The hotel staff were okay but not overly helpful in helping with your luggage up the stairs to the main floor with the lift. Lot's of little places to eat for breakfast and dinner and a really good laundromat down the road. Just don't expect a large room. I would say it would be a 3 star hotel at best. ,3,2023,09,23
103,Wonderful customer service. Helpful staff,"Clean and comfy. Good location. Helpful staff from taking bags early to directions. 
Some nice restaurants around area. Would recommend for friends or family to stay here. Close to Hyde park and easy access to underground.

103,Convenient stay,"Pros & Cons about Grand Park Paddington
Pros:  convenient location (< 10 min to tube station), very nice, safe and quiet neighborhood, very clean hotel, friendly staff.
Cons: (very) small bedroom with half meter between bed and walls, even if it was a ""Deluxe double room"".
Breakfast should have more options (e.g. just 2 kinds of cheese, 2 kinds of bread, a few fruit to choose,... ). In general it's ok but more a 3* breakfast. ",4,2023,09,05
103,5 stars good location,"Petronela and Rhian smilly and   very good service, very profesional and  good hotel also well located lots of shops around and High Park very near, was very happy , good holoday i realy recomanded.   I will defetnly come back.🥰❤️",5,2023,09,04
103,Great stay for the value,"Great location right down the street from Paddington station (where you can catch the underground or overground trains). They had us in the building across the street from the hotel, but still a great stay. We had three people in our room so they gave us a room with a queen bed and a pull out. Lots of space for the value- and they came to replace our towels and made the beds daily. ",5,2023,09,03
103,Amazing Experience,"Our time at Paddington Court was incredible! They were very accommodating and helpful! We had an issue with our initial room and they moved us to a different room without any problem!  The full English breakfast was delicious, the room was clean, and the staff friendly. Will definitely stay here again! Anahi, Shuja, and Colsten were very helpful throughout our stay! ",5,2023,09,03
103,Awful. Do not book this hotel,"Good location but that’s about it. 

Service is slow… nobody answers at reception… the people at the front desk are cold and rude… 

The room is tiny. The pillows are hard and flat. 

The bar is a joke and rarely open…

The food at breakfast is decent and waiters are nice but it’s in the old basement",1,2023,09,03
103,Good hotel good stay,the room is clean. The location is quite good and is very close to passing ton station. It’s very convenient for tourists to travel. The reception is very nice and help us keep our luggage. Thank you to Shuja colsten.,5,2023,09,02
103,Great location,"Great location,  waking distance from paddington station & Heathrow express. Staff were excellent especially Shaik,  who was an incredible help with brilliant service. Would stay again in a heartbeat ",5,2023,09,01
103,Hotel of choice!,"I have made the PG Paddington Court my hotel of choice on my business trips to London. Shuja Anani (front desk) and his colleagues went out of their way to make my stay special. Great location near train and tube station, restaurants and convenience stores nearby as well as excellent accomodation and reasonable pricing makes this hotel an excellent choice!",5,2023,08,31
103,great short stay with friendly helpful staff,"i had a great stay, i arrived before check in and staff helped put my bags in storage and then when i checked in i was very happy with my room, for the price i was pleasantly surprised, it’s in a very nice area close to main stations, check out was easy and shaik was very helpful with my bags",5,2023,08,30
103,Great experience!!,Everything was just perfect. Staff was very friendly and the room was clean!. Petronela at the reception was kind and helpful. We could keep the luggage safe for the rest of the day. Thank you so much ,5,2023,08,29
103,Minor complaints plus a turd ,"Key card didn't work... 5 minutes of faffing to programme a key card that didn't work the first time... Small room in the basement.... All forgivable for an over priced room in central London
Previous guest's turd left in the toilet bowl: Not so impressed 😕",2,2023,08,23
103,Horrible room - we called it a 'cell',"This was by far the worst hotel room I ever stayed in – smallest, most cramped. This hotel’s name is misleading, it should be called Park Tiny nor Grand as there was nothing grand about it. 

We got a T-shaped room tucked behind the elevator shaft, with two beds squeezed into two opposite sides of the T’s arms. There was barely room for movement between the wall and each bed. There was scarcely any room between the beds – in fact, I was glad we had just one, mid-sized suitcase. Opened it barely fit between the beds and if we had more luggage there would be no place whatsoever to put it let alone open it. The picture I snapped on the first night doesn’t show how cramped it was, since I had to use a wide lens to capture at least part of the room. 

To make things worse there was no access to daylight nor ability to let fresh air into the room. Technically, the room had a window, but it did not open. Nor would you want to open it, since it gave onto a dim, dirty courtyard, full of bird droppings (see picture of the “view”). 

The room so small & gloomy we took to calling it our “cell”. In fact in our part of Europe no one would even think of selling this space as a hotel room – it would have been a broom closet or storage. It was so good we stayed there only for 4 nights. 

Seeing the pictures from other guests I think we were assigned the worst room in the hotel (#104). I wonder why – maybe they did not like our last name? Or the fact that we booked via Booking.com and paid there? Or maybe it was because we asked for twin beds and based on the floor plan  I’ve seen on the door most rooms are doubles? Based on this plan only rooms 107-115 and 101-103 had street view. 105, 120, 119 and 122 also have windows with a view to a dim courtyard. Don’t know about the others, but if you want to risk staying here ask specifically for a proper room – they do have them, just not for everyone. 

Other things worth mentioning:
-	Breakfasts – o.k. – very small selection of food, poor quality scrambled eggs (clearly made from a premixed product, not actual eggs), poor coffee, other than that pretty average hotel breakfast. 
-	Cleanliness -  while small our “cell” was quite clean, also its bathroom was clean and cleaned every day.
-	Internet – as usual, the hotel internet was slow and unreliable.
-	Location: the only real plus of this place, next to rail, underground and Hyde Park.",1,2023,08,22
103,Great place to stay ,"I'd read some average to terrible reviews of nearby hotels so was a bit apprehensive before our stay, but I needn't have been. All the staff i met seemed really nice. Cosmin at reception was very proactive in helping us with luggage and was very professional and welcoming.  Rhian checked us in with no issues and was lovely. Catering staff were great at breakfast. I'd made some special requests regarding accessibility for the room that were actioned and they also made the room extra special with chocolates and wine for a special occassion which was really appreciated :). 
Breakfast was buffet (order poached or fried eggs if you like) which has a great selection and was very filling and tasty.
There's also a fitness room with some weights, 2x treadmills, bike and elyptical.
Great location to get to paddington 5/6min walk away. Restaurants/bars at paddington central or there's places like Ask very close by.
All in all, this is a great place to stay, would definitely come back :)

103,10 year anniversary stay,"We spent the night at Park Grand for our 10 year anniversary. On arrival we were told they had given us an upgrade from a Deluxe double to a Club Room, which meant we were staying in the main hotel Park Grand & not Paddinton Court Suites which we orignally booked. We were also greeted to a lovely gesture when we got to our room from the housekeeping team. We also enquired about room service & had a lovely full english delivered to our room. Ann at the front desk was lovely, very helpful, friendly & welcoming, as was Cosmin. We will defenitly be returning. 

Thank you so much! ",5,2023,08,20

103,Great stay,"1st time at this hotel & had a fantastic stay. Only a 5 min walk from Paddington tubestation.  The hotel looks lovely from the outside, friendly and efficient check-in. Arrived early so hotel looked after our luggage whilst we went out for the day. Room was on 4th floor and had a great view of London. Staff left a lovely treat in the room for her birthday, much to her delight. Room was perfect.. clean and modern, a little small but expected that anyway, no problem at all. Breakfast was great. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout, and looked after our luggage again before we left for home. Hotel is in a fantastic spot, 5-10 mins from Hyde Park and a few nice restaurants within walking distance. Highly recommended.",5,2023,08,15
103,Credit cards were stolen out of wallet and hotel hasn’t bothered to respond.,"The hotel lobby seemed a bit chaotic when we checked in but we were in a hurry to meet family so were just grateful to get checked in. I was a little alarmed that our room seemed to be in the back basement of the hotel but again, we were in a hurry to see family so didn’t want to argue about our room. Upon check out the woman at the check out desk asked if there was any reason we wouldn’t give them five stars, which we thought was odd, but we kind of shrugged and she asked us to review them and give them five stars. Off we went to Ireland whereupon I received a call from Peter letting me know that I had left my wallet at the hotel with ‘lots of credit cards’. I arranged to have my son come and pick up the wallet the next day. When my son arrived, the front desk clerk claimed they had no wallet and no record of the wallet. My son called me and I reminded him to use Peter’s name which worked. However, when my son brought my wallet to me, two credit cards were missing. Once I saw that there was fraudulent activity on the card, I realized they had been stolen. I contacted the hotel and received a response from the reservations department apologizing for the inconvenience and assuring me that someone would be in touch. It has now been a week and nobody has contacted me. I emailed one more time to attempt to sort this out before I wrote this review. I will never stay here ever again because it is obvious by their silence that there is an issue. I booked through American Express and have alerted them to my concerns.",1,2023,08,14
103,Amazing,My stay at paddington was amazing. My room was very cozy and clean and the housekeeping staff were great help. Location was great - easy to get anywhere. Special thanks to Valentina and Anahi for the kind welcome and send off. Would definitely recommend.,5,2023,08,14
103,Comfortable place,"well located place with comfortable rooms and friendly staff, delicious breakfasts, rooms are small but very comfortable, check-in is fast and does not require extra time.  Otherwise, just a comfortable hotel where it is convenient to spend the night or stay for a long time if you have big plans for London",5,2023,08,14
103,Great stay!,"Very pleased with the convenient location. Clean and reasonable size rooms. Helpful and friendly staff. I would return to this hotel again. Convience store steps away, great restaurants, small shops and less than a ten minute walk to Paddington Station.",5,2023,08,14
103,"Avoid, especially if you have luggage or mobility issues ","This hotel has a few things going for it: location and air conditioning. Booked a junior suite and was given a triple. - mentioned this and guy checking in insisted they were the same. Front desk staff are hostile and clearly hate their jobs. Getting to the room requires going up and down numerous stairs and traversing a maze. There is no one to assist with luggage so unless you bring a small bag good luck to you. Front desk folks were super unhelpful as far as any direction to get to your room. I had to ask about the included breakfast. Bed is bouncy and pull out couch takes up half of the tiny triple room I was given in lieu of the junior suite I purchased. The make you pay as soon as you walk in before checking you in. Please, save yourselves and stay elsewhere! I would never return to this place!!",1,2023,08,11
103,Nice to stay!,"Great location! Less than 10mins to Paddington station and Elizabeth line so easy to access anywhere. Also it is so close to Hyde Park which is really good place to chill~And Anahi Valentina and shuja  was really kind too!
",5,2023,08,11
103,Ok for short break!,"We booked a deluxe double room for our mini moon in August 2023, we had messaged the hotel before arriving that it would be a mini moon trip and to have a nice room but the message was never responded to. We checked in and it seemed busy which we thought was good sign. We stayed in room 204, it was a peculiar shape, very small and nothing deluxe about it. Our view was an old fire emergency escape exit outside our window amd could hear people smoking/outside at random times. The shower clogged and filled everytime we used it, the toilet flusher stuck and the noise from the cistern filling up was so loud until we unstuck the flusher. The room was clean but very small. We found it quite bizarre that we were given one toilet roll and this was only replenished the day before we departed, no spare rolls were left in the bathroom. God forbid there was a need for extra. Even the tissue box was left with one tissue and not replensihed during our stay. 
The main reason we booked was due to the location, which was fantastic, aside from that it is no more than a 3 star hotel, book the park grand lanacaster gate if you would like more luxury and attentive staff. We stayed here before and wish we had of booked it for this trip, lesson learned!",3,2023,08,10
103,Nice hotel,"-Quite and near from everything 
-Nice rooms and good service 
-Cleaning every day 
-Wonderful welcoming especially from ANA

103,Great experience!,"I have been on course in London for the past year and have always stayed in park grand. Its a short walking distance away from paddington station and you are always greeted with enthusiasm and a smile. I have had the pleasure of dealing with Easterna and she has upgraded me a couple of times to a lovely club room! She has a positive demeanour and always wants to help!

They were always ready to assist me with any inquiries or requests, ensuring that I felt valued and well-cared for throughout my stay.",5,2023,07,03
103,Avoid ,"Avoid this hotel, its more like a hostel definitely star or even 3 star. Everything is worn and needs replaced. The only good thing about it surprisingly was the breakfast, better than I thought. The reception team need customer service training, never saw a smile once. ",1,2023,07,03
103,Great stay,"Lovely hotel,room was very comfy and clean.
Staff where very friendly and helpful, Kazi was great,he helped with our luggage on arrival and on the day we left,excellent service.
Great location near Hyde Park for the concert we attended, and Paddington train station.

103,Underwhelmed ,"This hotel is extremely overpriced, I paid £320 for a small, campy room. The bed was tiny and every uncomfortable, and falling to pieces (the base of the bed was coming away) and the sheets were not particularly clean. This hotel charges like a wounded bull, and we’ll above its star rating, it is a budget hotel, pretending to be luxury (charging).",1,2023,07,01
103,Nice experience,"The rooms are rather small, but I got an upgrade upon check in the staff is friendly, my room was good and bathroom very neat the lady at reception Anahi was very accommodating and was able to recommend places to visit. In overall we had a good experience here ! We’ll be back",5,2023,06,30
103,Recommend!,"Very warm welcome from the team Shuja, Meave, Kazi and Easterina. 
Very central location, clean hotel and everything you need for your stay.
Loved the little touches in the room of chocs and wine but also welcomed the cold water on the hottest of days! Air con was a dream!",5,2023,06,30
103,3-star hotel,"This is NOT a 4 star hotel, I would consider it a 3-star. Issues we noted:

1. STAIRS. The building appears to have been a home that was converted into a hotel. To get to the elevator you had to climb stairs from the lobby. To get to the breakfast room you had to walk down stairs. Numerous rooms are placed on awkward half-landings, requiring maneuvering multiple flights of steps, even AFTER using the elevator. Terrible for luggage and those needing mobility assistance.
2. Air conditioning was not functioning at first, a fair amount of back-and-forth with staff ensued before they finally got it working after a couple of hours. 
3. Not sure if this was related to issue #2, but we got a phone call from staff at around 1am which woke everyone up.
4. Room safe did not function at first, we had to wait for staff to fix it. It turned out the batteries were dead.
5. The mini fridge in the room wasn’t very cold, and was unstably situated so that opening the door would result in things falling out.
6. Breakfast was the exact same thing every single day. Fine for a few days, frustrating if staying a week or longer. 
7. General 4-star touches were missing. The second bed in a “suite” was a sofa bed, room service meals did not appear to be available, no on-site restaurant, etc.

The location was excellent, but again, I do not believe this should be classified as a 4-star hotel. I would say do not pay over $250 a night, and that $150-$200 is probably the fairest average range.",3,2023,06,30
103,Amazing,"I really enjoyed my short stay. Was in London for business, the service here is great, in special thanks to the helpful service of Anahi, location was perfect, I would love to return here next time. Thanks!",5,2023,06,29
103,Nice Hotel in Cute Paddington Neighborhood,"5 minute walk from Paddington station, so it was very convenient to get from place to place. Many local markets are open until late, and overall, the neighborhood and hotel were very nice. We made sure to book a club room because we saw reviews that the rooms were very small (which they were but I think that’s mostly what you’re going to see in London. The club room bed was nice and spacious. We purchased breakfast during check-in and it was very nicely set up and convenient. ",5,2023,06,29
103,Pleasant stay,Room are clean 👌free water bottles in rooms station is close by shops around Caffè and pubs ..hyde park nearby just by walking .service was good thanks to Easter and all.the staff working there..all are amazing..many thanks....,5,2023,06,28
103,Just amazing,"Thanks to Ana she was great giving us good suggestions of places to visit we had a great time, the best thing of the hotel is the location (central and near stations) im happy with the room and the hotel, easy to travel and the attention is good, would definitely book again here",5,2023,06,28
103,Nice hotel ,"It was a good hotel and a quiet place, it’s near to shops, 15 minutes away from haydpark and oxford street by walking and 30 minutes to harrods Mall . Nice stuff specially Anahi. I will try it again. ",5,2023,06,28
103,Loved itv,"Petronela & Kazie &’Petruit Anahí & Sheik were very helpful. We arrived in London on the red eye and they arranged to give our room early so we could sleep! Later we were given a later check out. The rooms were comfy and fully wired for Wifi, cable tv and device charging. Will definitely stay here again ",5,2023,06,27
103,很棒,"The roomn is very good im happy with my stay. Me and my friend came to London from China to visit and had a pleasant stay. Everyone in the hotel is very kind and accommodating, breakfast selection is extensive and tasty. Hyde park is 5 min walking distance and is an amazing park. Anahi, Petronela and Sheik were very good people towards us. We would love come back and stay here for sure ",5,2023,06,27
103,Park grand paddington court,Super clean hotel smells great when you walk in and the hotel is super close to the train station. We walked 5 minutes from the station to get here. Ana Petronela helped us check in and she was so sweet. The absolute best. Would definitely recommend staying here,5,2023,06,27
103,No volveria,"I stayed at the hotel for the 2023 London Marathon weekend.
The location and aesthetics of the façade is very good.
A few blocks from Paddington Station and Hyde Park.
The Big Bus stops at 2 places nearby.
Breakfast is optional It is preferable to have breakfast somewhere nearby.
The room that we were assigned as a double standard was very small. It does not exceed 15 square meters. The bed was at 20 cm from the wall. Personally I have had a bad experience with some of the staff.
The day before my departure, and as requested by them, I requested that they reserve a taxi for me to go to the airport, which they did not do and the staff that was at the reception at the time of check out did not want to solve my problem, arguing that in there are few taxis at that time Unfortunately I had to run out into the street in search of one myself",2,2023,06,26
103,Do not recommend: not as it appears,"We booked accomodation at The Devonshire for 5 nights. The first night we had booked to allow for early check-in after a long-haul flight (from Australia) where we arrived at 8am. I emailed the staff informing of our approximate arrival time with an explanation as to why we booked the extra night. When we arrived, staff did not have our room ready and were also going to charge more than the original price (we booked via Booking.com) for 4 nights. When we questioned staff (our reservation moved between 3 staff members) until 1 staff member informed us that check in was at the usual time of 2pm as we did not notify them of our arrival. We expressed that we had emailed (with the date/time and reason explaining why) which they didn’t argue as it seemed they realised we did in fact notify them. We said we were willing to pay for the 5 nights if our room would be available as we had heavy luggage and need shower/change after our flight. Staff seemed very disorganised and inexperienced. When we arrived in our room approximately 40-60 mins later, it was on the 6th floor with no elevator and did not at all appear to be what was depicted in the photos. A warning to other travellers, while it is conveniently located in London in a nice area it is overpriced, with small rooms and even smaller bathrooms. ",2,2023,06,26
103,London Paddington stop over,"The staff were friendly and very accommodating. Rooms, typical UK hotel space wise, efficient and easy to use for a couple. Our travel companions required additional assistance and the staff were right on it. 
Great location and a nice area with good restaurants and access.
Would definitely book again.",5,2023,06,25

103,Best in best - easy acess to all the places in London ,"Best access to all the places in London. Nice and clean hotel. 
I am staying in park grand hotels for many years and they are always friendly and nice to me.
Easterna is the best in there and she always help me and make me comfortable on my every stay. Thank you park grand paddington court. ",5,2023,06,16
103,Over night stay ,"Overall a lovely stay. We had one night at the Park Grand where we were met by reception staff who check us in efficiently despite the rather chaotic foyer because the check in system was down. We were offered an upgrade which was welcomed as it was my daughters birthday. The processco and chocolate was very appreciated.The room was comfortable and clean and we had a good nights sleep. We didn’t have breakfast so can’t comment on the quality or quantity. One thing which I would say did spoil it was at check out, I did feel rather pressured into writing a review on the spot which I felt was a little off and in my opinion I would have probably written a much more favourable review had I not been made to write a review there and then with added pressure to include names etc … in the end I refused to be cajoled into a review and hence why I am writing it now .. a little advice don’t hassle continue with good service and the best reviews will be written. On the whole we would definitely recommend and stay again ",4,2023,06,15
103,"Great stay, great location!","The hotel is situated in a great location, the staff were very friendly on the front desk (Anaki and Easterna). We stayed for my husbands birthday and they decorated the room and left chocolates and a bottle of bubbly which was a lovely touch! ",5,2023,06,14
103,Really good,"Room was great, breakfast was good, staff was friendly.
It was my birthday and the staff had prepared some special decorations in the room, this was a lovely touch.
The location is great as well, very close to 2 tube stations (Paddington, or Lancaster Gate) and also very close to Hyde Park.",5,2023,06,14
103,GLAD STAY,"all good we stayed here with a group of friends and gad  glad stay. I would not have a bad comment about this experience, i would.recommend this hotel for a visit to LONDON the staff here is very helpfull and friendly special mention to Anahi and Easterna at reception, Kazi helped us with the lugagges too. We would come back no doubts ",5,2023,06,14
103,Not a Family Friendly Hotel ,"As excited as I was to stay at Park Grand Paddington, it was a big disappointment. Several times before our stay I emailed requesting a baby cot for our room, and never heard back. When we went to check in, I made sure to request it again. Our room wasn't ready, so we went to hit the town. When we went back in the evening to check in, the front desk let us know that we could be upgraded rooms, but it would be on the 4th fourth floor and the elevator was broke.. We said sure, we'll check it out, excited by an upgrade.  It was up over 6 flights of stairs to walk up with a toddler, stroller and luggage. We were sweating when we entered the room to sadly realize it was no larger than a closet. While I understand London hotel rooms run small, this was no upgrade. The wallpaper was peeling off the wall with mold behind it and there were white stains on the bedding. We had no idea where a baby cot would even fit. When we told staff we didn't want this ""upgrade"", we were told that this was the only room left in the hotel. That's when it was clear we were duped, it wasn't an upgrade, it was the only bad option and they were trying to make it sound good. After we were told there was no other option, the staff ""found"" another room. When the receptionist walked me to the room and opened the door, she realized the room wasn't cleaned with towels hanging all over the place and couldn't offer that to us. Then magically a third room appeared across the street for us to stay in. It didn't have mold and could be reached by elevator, so it was an improvement. The room was definitely not the size to accommodate a baby cot. The bathroom door couldn't close with the baby cot nor could the closet be used. This situation was extremely frustrating for several reasons: it was so clear the hotel wasn't prepared or organized (ecsp when they took us to a dirty room), they wasted our time taking us from room to room & it was clear from even before we checked in that we needed a room that could fit a babycot. If a hotel can't support those needs, they shouldn't offer them.  While things went smoother after were finally in our tiny room, our hearts dropped the next day when coming back to our room after a full day of exploring - the cleaning staff never closed our door when they were done. It was left cracked open. It was terrifying to have my husband have to go in ahead of us to make sure nothing was stolen or harmed since the door was so carelessly left open. What makes this worse was our room didn't include a safe box, so there wasn't anywhere to keep valuables. Luckily, all was fine, it was clear the bed had been made and towels replaced but the door left open.
When we left 3 days later, the elevator was still broken, so I question if it's ever in use... 

Overall, the location was great, but at what cost is that worth? 

Pros: 
-Great location - train station and eateries nearby 

Cons:
-Unreliable elevator  (if you have to use the stairs, floors 1 & 2 actually are divided into 2, so the 4th floor is actually about 6 flights of stairs up) 
-Small Rooms 
-Big hotel staff just standing around 
-Dirty & Mold 
-No Safes in the room ",2,2023,06,13
103,Excellent stay for a week,Excellent hotel with excellent service! Stayed here for a week and everything we needed was within walking distance. The room was impeccably clean and we never had to worry about loud noises or being disturbed in the middle of the night. The bathrooms were extremely clean and the linens were changed every day. The staff was extremely helpful and answered any questions and needs we had during the trip. We will definitely be staying here again!,5,2023,06,13
103,experience at park grand Paddington,"It was a good experience at the hotel. Best part about it was the location to nearby tube and buses as well as local restaurants. The staff was really helpful, specially Anahi. Only small drawback was their small room but it was still manageable. ",4,2023,06,12
103,Good hotel,"Good hotel, friendly staff and good breakfast. Good locaties in the centre of London, we would love to go back some time. In the neighbourhood You can find some shops in you need something. I woud recommend thuis hotel. Anahi helped me very good to check out",5,2023,06,12

103,Won’t be back,"Booked six months ago at other grand hotel,  on arrival “ did you not get email ? “. Two hours ago !  Room not available .  We were moved to Paddington.   Family room not in the hotel but across the road.    We could not open the curtains as there was scaffolding all around.   We had to put up with the noise of a generator of some sort all night .   The bed was so hard it was difficult to sleep.   The single bed was like a camp bed.    The room was clean.   We will never return to this group of hotels again,  at no stage was there an apology ",1,2023,06,10
103,Good stay,Very practical room with good view of street. Comfortable bed and nice bathroom. Comfy bed and useful mirror. Would definitely stay at this hotel again on furtive trips to London. Really enjoyed this trip had the best time ,5,2023,06,09

Specially EASTERNA, MEAVE.
The surroundings were quiet and safe, and my friends and I spent three very happy nights here. It is highly recommended that you check in here.",5,2023,06,08
103,Nice London Stay,"We selected the Park Grand Paddington because of its location to Paddington, TripAdvisor Reviews and price. It worked well.  We reserved a club twin room to have the extra room size given we stayed for six nights. The Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line worked to/from Heathrow.  There was a discount to pre-pay the breakfast - which was quite nice - served in the basement banquet room. The room was very quiet - the bed was comfortable enough and clean.  Wifi was very good.  The air conditioning is not robust - there is a cap at 19 degrees.  It worked well enough for our visit. There were some stairs to navigate to and from our room - given the construct of the of the building and how the rooms are set.  The Lancaster Gate metro stop was close and convenient to getting into central London. We did find some restaurants that worked for us - Le meena cafe a short walk was a nice breakfast alternative - Hobsons Fish and Chips for a simple meal - The Taormina italian restaurant-just down the street  was our best meal - I would recommend them -   Bizzarro italian restaurant was our worst tasting meal - I would pass on them ( pasta was not well cooked and no flavor).  I would stay here again.",4,2023,06,07
103,Not the greatest!,"We arrived on Saturday May 20th, staying until May 27th, around 12:30 pm. Easy 5 mins. walk from Paddington Station. Nice tree lined side street. Our room was not ready so we left our bags at reception and asked to have a taxi take us to Notting Hill Gate (Portabello Rd. Market). The lady at reception pretended not to know what or where Notting Hill was. Which we thought quite odd. Who doesn't know this? We arrived back to the hotel around 4 pm and were given room 206 which is right above the main entrance and faces the street. Room was VERY SMALL. I realize now never to book a ""compact double"". There is no way that bed was a double but we managed and lesson learnt. A/C worked well, too well. Was quite cold in the room most days. Tried to turn the A/C off then it got too hot. No happy medium could be found. Our room didn't get cleaned for 2 days, we were out of towels, had to go to reception and request it to be cleaned. Is this a new COVID thing? The fire alarm went off one night around midnight then just as we were going back to sleep it went off again. No one came to explain what happened or apologize for the inconvenience. We went to reception another day to ask for a taxi to be arranged to take us to The Ritz, as we had a reservation for Afternoon tea, and again the lady at reception pretended to not know ""The Ritz"" . Who doesn't know The Ritz! I'm not sure what the meaning of this is. Maybe they didn't want to be bothered booking us a taxi? Who knows! 

In conclusion, it wasn't the best and would likely not book there again. It was very convenient to Paddington Station but that is all. ",3,2023,06,07

103,It was perfect!! Thanks for everything:),"PETRONELA ans SUJIA.  It was my second visit to the Paddington Hotel. The first time in February 2022. What I really liked best was the location. I love the green and within minutes I'm in Hyde & Kensington Park, a dream come true. All around there are super delicious restaurants and of course Paddington Station, which is less than 15 minutes' walk away, just perfect! Rooms were clean, relatively old furniture but definitely sufficient for a city trip. Always water in the room and different teas. Bathroom is always maintained and clean with new towels every day. Since I was traveling alone, the room was sufficient :) All in all, very good, especially since you're usually out and about all day. For a more comfortable holiday, I would prefer the ""MotelOne London Bridge"", for example, because you can still sit comfortably in the lounge there in the evening and treat yourself to a cocktail. There is also an extensive breakfast there. But that's just an example :)",5,2023,06,06

103,Do not stay here!,"Stayed in a twin room x 1  night at the beginning of our UK holiday: up and downs stairs, through a maze of hallways to access it. Could hear people walking around, dropping things etc in the room above all night long. Plans changed due to the pending rail strike so had to return to London earlier than expected: booked a deluxe double room x 4 nights hoping it would be better than the twin. (No other hotels available within our price range due to the coronation.) The DD room was tiny, dirty carpet, no where to sit other than the bed, old, dusty furniture.  Shower door opening was only 14"" wide so anyone with a girth > 14"" would never fit. Bed was extremely uncomfortable and only had a thin cotton mattress cover.  The hotel  needs a total renovation. The only positive things are the breakfast and location.   Quite sure staff members are writing the 'amazing' reviews because they certainly don't reflect reality.  One staff member approached me with a card with her name on it requesting I write a TripAdvisor review! Seriously??  In all my travels I have never had this request. 
I do not recommend this hotel.",2,2023,05,18

103,Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in,"WORST HOTEL EVER. Check in the girls barely noticed we were there, we were given directions to the smallest room that ever existed overlooking a construction site. The second room they gave us had a syringe under the bed and vomit on the floor. After going down once again (the phone in the room didn't work) the duty manager 3 hours later got us another room/  the Duty Manager explained 'they have approximately 220 rooms of which 15-20 get cleaned each day.’ 
You do not need to be Einstein to work out that the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel clean their rooms based on this information shared by management, on average, every 11 days! You better hope you are the first day of the new cycle! we were promised a one night refund, lots of emails and then nothing. It's not the money it's simply the worst Hotel we have stayed in EVER. Web beds the wholesaler contacted them after being shown the email and photo trail and they denied knowing anything about it.",1,2023,05,08

103,Visit to Park Grand Paddington.,"Had a very nice stay. You couldn’t ask for a better location. The folks were very accommodating and when my stay unfortunately went from 2 to solo, the staff was very accommodating and made sure my stay was comfortable by pushing the two beds together.

103,Do not waste your money ,"I paid £160 to stay here. Rooms are VERY small. You can’t walk around the bed as it’s stuck to the wall both sides. Staff member was rude when I queried the size of the room. He said “well some people pay £160 to stay in these rooms” even though I did pay that much, it was implied that I did not pay enough. The staff member spoke with a raised tone which was uncalled for. Would not recommend staying here in conclusion as it’s definitely not worth the price and experience is unfriendly. ",1,2023,05,02

I researched them before and they had done this to others

103,Arrived to find my room had been sold to someone else and no room available!,"I booked my room at this hotel on October 20th 2022 when I received confirmation of my place in the London Marathon. I booked through Hotels.com with the pay at property deal.

After a 4 hour journey I arrived at the hotel on Sat 22nd April to find that the hotel had infact given my room to somebody else and was now full. After going backwards and forwards, speaking direct to hotels.com and checking my emails, the hotel offered no option to stay at the hotel whatsoever and I was left to foot the bill at a much higher price to stay in a different hotel so I can participate in tomorrows Marathon. 

I recieved an email 3 days before my arrival to confirm my booking was guaranteed and that I was to pay at the hotel. Unfortunately due to me booking well in advance and securing a reasonable rate, the hotel knew that with this weekend being a busy one in London with the Fa cup and London marathon, the hotel has undoubtedly sold my room for a higher rate.

The service was terrible with no compassion from the reservation staff at all. 

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1,2023,04,22

103,Smelt like a dead body....,"The pictures don't match the ad!!!  Our room, we were told was an upgrade!  Upgrade from what?.... sleeping in a dumpster?  They paraded us and our luggage down a small musky smelling hallway to a dark, dungeon like room that left you to believe you were staying in Grandma's basement except the smell was so strong it felt like a dead body was down there with you... like now you know where Grandpa went when he disappeared a few months back!   When we complained about the conditions, they offered to come spray the room....WTF!  Putting perfume on a dead body I'm sure would still just smell like a dead body with a touch of ""roses""?  When I asked if we could get a new room, they responded that they were full and besides...""you are in an upgraded room"". A huge hotel that is 100% full on a Tuesday night?  Not likely!  The bathroom was so small and had a regular size sink in the middle which made taking care of your morning business difficult, especially on an angle with your legs together!  The staff were useless, and even a little bit of scary sometimes as we never saw them smile. If we did see them smile, we would just think it's gas because they weren't very friendly!  DO NOT BOOK!!!  They were many great little hotels right in that area as this is no way a four-star hotel! Barely makes one star, and I would only give it a one star because we made it out alive!",1,2023,04,19

Maithilee Esterna",5,2023,03,23
103,Rather nice,"The Park Grand Paddington Court is a nice hotel, although I would not classify it as excellent as some reviewers do. While we were aware that we had booked a small room, it was too small for a bed that could accommodate me at 5 foot 11, and there was barely enough space to move around in. For instance, I had to climb over my partner just to get into bed.

Furthermore, the reception staff exhibited a strange level of ignorance. We had booked an extra night's stay and asked if we could keep the same room, the reception staff was unsure how to handle the request and provided us with a phone number to call.

On the bright side, the hotel's location is fantastic as it's situated close to Paddington station (train and underground) and Lancaster Gate station (underground) and is within walking distance to Hyde Park. Additionally, there are numerous excellent breakfast cafes in the area.",3,2023,03,20

103,All the good bits of Fawlty Towers without the bad,"So, this hotel is actually several properties that have been internally connected, so the floor levels don't match and there are areas that are definitely not wheelchar accessible (ditto rolling suitcases, which you have to lift up flights of stairs). And the staff are a wild mix of diversity who have hearts of gold despite being clearly overwhelmed sometimes (the receptionist tried to charge me twice for my room). So it really does have a 'Fawlty Towers' feel to it, but without the bad bits because the overall effect is rather charmingly eccentric, and the rooms are definitely worth it.

I was intrigued when they assigned me a basement room (yes, there are rooms below street level) but although it is compact, it's been very well designed and has high quality fittings. So, the Grohe tapware gave me one of the best showers I've had in a hotel, and the bathroom floor is heated (no I am not joking, they really are). The desk has all the charging ports a full business set-up would need, even down to HDMI and triple AV jacks. The tea and coffee comes with delightful little biscuits and the staff literally run (yes run) things to you if you ring reception for toiletries etc.",5,2023,03,11
103,7 days in London,"This is the second time i stayed in this hotel the selection based on the location wise first which is near PADDINGTON station the helpful for coming from the airport also because of the cleaning and tidy hotel, also the  staffs in front desk and reception were so  cooperative and kindly specially Manager Mr Vency who tried to keep our hospitality comfortable and Mr Kazi",5,2023,03,11

103,Birthday surprise gone right,"My stay was part of a birthday surprise so I am not familiar with the booking process. The staff decorated the room for me which was really sweet as it was my birthday the evening I checked in. 

To me, the size of the room was perfect, however, I would understand if people with more luggage would find it a bit small. I stayed with my partner and we only had small backpacks with us. Since we only came back for sleeping and stayed out all day, I didn't care. 

Room service made sure it was always clean. The bathroom was clean and modern. All staff members were extraordinarily friendly and made sure we had a fantastic stay.

Paddington station is a 5 min walk away. You will find corner stores, cafes, pubs and fast food chains in the close vicinity. 

Definitely a recommendation. Thank you for the nice experience! ",5,2023,03,04

Not accessible - had to wind round lengths of corridors with steps along the way and difficult to get suitcase through. Devoid of furniture except for one chair. Think Cell Block H.,1,2023,02,26

103,"Terrible, couldn't stay even one night","Arrived at 10pm for 4 night stay. We had booked a Deluxe Double room through Qantas Hotels.
Room was called a Deluxe Double, but was so small that there was no room to lay our suitcases down flat to open them. There was a luggage stand, but no room to open it. We were on holiday from Australia, so had large suitcases.
There was one thin bottom sheet over the matress. No mattress cover! The sheet had stains and hair strands on it.  
Spoke to reception about dirty bed. While at reception,  a couple were speaking to another reception officer about their dirty room. I asked for 2 clean sheets - one to act as mattress cover and also for a bigger room.
Person at reception was very apologetic and said he'd call the manager to ask about bigger room, but there was not another room available for that night. He contacted manager who said an upgrade would cost an additional 1300.00 pounds for the remaining 3 nights. On top of what we'd already paid.
Receptionist was kind and offered free breakfast next morning, but was unable to resolve the situation.
Could not bring myself to sleep on that bed even with the 2 clean sheets provided. So we checked out at 11.30pm and went to a hotel nearby.
Not sure if they had forgotten to change  the bed after previous occupant.
However I've never known a hotel to have only 1 bottom sheet on the matress.
If the room was a deluxe double, I can't imagine the size of the standard double.",1,2023,02,25

103,Comfort and ease in central London,"Park Grand Paddington Court is an excellent choice to stay in Paddington, London. The hotel is close to Hyde Park. Many attrctions can be reached easily with underground or are at in brisk walking distance.

The hotel has peaceful atmosphere and a good night's sleep is guaranteed. Breakfast is alvailable as well as a restaurant. Restauroitu serves delicious Indian food as well as Brtish and conntinental favourites.

Surroundings of the hotel represent traditional London architecture. As of 2023 the hotel has been running in the current buulding for around ten years consequtively, as far as I know. For the customer the experience is of convenience.",5,2023,01,04

103,Generally up to standard but ...,"We were offered another room, which was quite satisfying, before being given a very cramped room on the ground (or the basement?).  
The first room offered was 6_ _, which was located in the annex opposite the main building. This was okay. But the  route leading to this room was soooooooooooooo queer! I can't remember how many turns we had been guided through before we saw a very small room in gloomy situation. Smell of mothed carpet or fabric was obvious. What we saw outside the window showed that it was the basement (not very sure) 
Luckily the staff changed a room for us. This second one was normal except the corner of the curtain was not properly hung and we could see outside high above us (the same from the outside).  Good in heating system, the space and the facilities.
I wonder why the first room would be offered to guests (tariff higher than 110 pounds)!",3,2022,12,30
103,Dreamy vacation,"This is just the perfect hotel to store your luggage while you’re exploring the great city of London. If you don’t spend your nights sleeping you would not be bothered by the complete lack of sound proofing between rooms, noisy ventilation, short beds and a mattress that made my back begging to sleep on the floor.

I was also a nice touch to be “upgraded” to a room in the basement accompanied with several flies that occupied the bathroom when we’re not there to shower in the beautiful “lack of pressure“ shower and a sink that drained slower than a spin in the London Eye.

We'll recommend this hotel to everyone the spends the days shopping and the nights clubbing :)",5,2022,12,30
103,Our stay in December,"We had two rooms booked. One was on 2nd floor, the other ended up being in the basement. The floors pretty much throughout were dirty. The carpets in the halls and in the bedroom were stained. The carpets have some sort of pattern, but  some of the stains were on the lighter sections. Most of the walls leading to our room were scuffed and banged up. The bed in the 2nd floor room had a top sheet on the mattress pad, instead of a fitted sheet, so it kept coming off. The mattress was probably older than my grandmother as it had a HUGE indentation, so you were forced to lie in the little indentation.  It was extremely difficult it to find both rooms. The lay out of the hotel  is very confusing and not well indicated.  I could not even tell you anything about the restaurant. The staff did not mention anything about it and I never happened to see it in my journey from the second floor room to the basement room.  We had previously stayed 3 nights at The Resident in Covent Gardens, and their hotel was excellent in every respect, so maybe it was because we had just come from such  a nice hotel to this one? I don’t know. The location was good however and we were able to walk to restaurants.",2,2022,12,27
103,Good experience,"We staying here during 2 night and everything was perfect! 
The personel here is just amazing and here for you. 
10/10 for Kazi who been here for all our questions about london and service.

103,Great experience!,Nice room and lovely Prosecco and chocolates. Beautiful hotel and although a slightly delayed check in Valar was an excellent host. Would definitely stay here again and will be returning next time I’m in London ,5,2022,12,22
103,Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at…,"Pay attention! The room standard is very low! It’s NOT a four star standard. Pictures must be old as they are not true to reality. We ordered 4 deluxe rooms and the rooms are all terrible!! Dirty, small rooms! Beds are very small, and linen were dirty. Worst of all, 2 of our 4 rooms have a giant noisy ventilation running just outside the window making it hard to sleep. 
I’m never ever going to stay at this hotel again!!",1,2022,12,20
103,Miss,"The hotel is located in a really good place, in a walking distance from Paddicton Station and Hyde Park.

103,Reservation,"The Reservation for my special room request due to my health status was done over a  phone call before take off to London due to having issue with online booking and really it was so smooth and quick in spite of short notice in crowded season.
Thanks to Anoop Nayar whom was so patient to trying to understand my bad voice quality to enable do the booking.",5,2022,12,06

My room was great: clean, comfortable bed and nice hot shower plus some lovely extra touches. Thank you to all the team!! You’re all doing an excellent job. See you again soon.",5,2022,12,05
103,Excellent hotel considering the price,"First of all, the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Location was brilliant, less than 10 minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube station for central line. Room was everything you need. Really comfy bed and great sized shower room. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2022,11,27
103,Good time in London,"Valan was very kind 😁 he helped us with everything. All the employees are kind. We enjoyed staying in hotel. The breakfast was great. The hotel is in a great position,near underground. We will come back for sure.",5,2022,11,26
103,"Not suitable for business, might move you with no notice, better avoided","With no warning they put me in the back up hotel. Staff in back up hotel did not explain any of the amenities or when breakfast was. There was also a lack of hygiene of some staff members.

Room was acceptable and shower was nice. 
Terrible wifi - could not even load google at some points. No suitable to work from.

Not worth what they charge.",2,2022,11,24
103,Comfortable and well-located hotel,"I recently stayed here for one night for a work trip. The hotel is well-located. The check-in was fast and I got a free room upgrade (I'd booked a single room, I was upgraded to a double). The room was pleasant and clean. There was a big TV with freeview channels. The staff were lovely. I was checked out by Maithilee who provided a fast and friendly service.

I paid for the breakfast too, which was an extra £15 through booking.com (turned out to be cheaper to book directly, £12). For £15/12 the breakfast wasn't worth it, as it was a self-serve continental with basic cooked items. The coffee was bad. I wouldn't recommend it if you're staying for a few days, but if you're travelling and want something convenient then it's fine.",4,2022,11,24
103,"Very disappointed, won’t be back.","Special 3-night stay in London for my wife’s birthday I paid for a club room. The location of the Hotel is great, staff OK and the room was clean however I was generally disappointed with my stay.

Breakfast – First morning broken glass over floor by entrance step. Reported this to a staff member but was still there when we had finished. Listed as a continental, there was very little choice. Looked like the hotel has decided to offer a cooked breakfast which was cold and very lacking in quality/choice. So much so we decided not to bother the third morning. 

Booked this hotel as a lounge bar was listed but it really is more like a canteen corridor which I noted had closed by 10:45 on Saturday night. (Picture attached) and No Club Lounge or we never found it

Club Room – Small and the sink gurgled every time the shower was used. There was no hotel information in the room i.e., breakfast times etc. I called reception 3 times but no reply, saw they Whats app on website but again no reply. The room was serviced on Friday no problem but not Saturday. When I asked reception, they said we should have put a light on I said we didn’t on Friday, and anyway there is no information in the room to see.",1,2022,11,23
103,Excellent stay!!,"The hotel is located within a short walking distance from Paddington station. Room is bright and cozy with clean toilet.  Staff are friendly and sincere. Thanks to Petroneca’s warm welcoming at reception, and also the kind assistance from concierge. Very nice breakfast as well.",5,2022,11,22
103,Amazing time at the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel,"We were visiting London for our anniversary, it was our first time to this city and we were happily surprised at the reception we received at the hotel. The people were very warm and welcoming - special mention to Colston, Maithlee and Petrola. They made sure to make us feel special by getting us the most delicious cake, some mouthwatering chocolates, good wine and a sweet decor. 
Really happy with the service, the room upgrade (which was also very kindly added without us asking for it) and the food too!
Totally recommend your stay here!",5,2022,11,22
103,Advise not to book at this hotel,"Stayed at this hotel, rooms weren’t together and rooms not the ones we booked. We recommend not staying here. Booked pay at property option but 48 hours before money taken out of account pending transaction , which understood to secure rooms but when got to the hotel had to pay the amount again and told the pending transaction would be reveresed straight away, it was not. Asked the following day, again told it would be reversed that day, again it was’nt. contacted them the following day again they said it would be reversed but now informed it might take another 48 hours. Email to the company no reply, poor customer service, so take into account you will pay double the amount you have been quoted.",1,2022,11,21
103,Great stay for a few days ,"We had a fantastic stay here. The staff were extremely friendly and let us store our luggage before check-in. The room was a good size, bed was very comfy and the bathroom was very clean with a great shower. Good TV and the window opened a decent amount. The only issue we had was that some guests and/or staff, not sure which, were very loud in the corridors around 6am in the mornings. Perhaps a reminder to all guests to be considerate of others in the mornings would be helpful. Apart from that, we had a great stay and would definitely come back. ",4,2022,11,18

103,Amazing  hotel in central  London,"I had such an amazing stay at park grand Paddington! The moment I entered the hotel Florin at the reception took care of my reservation and made me feel so welcomed! The hotel location was superb! I was able to commute through the tube everyday and a lot of walkable destinations like Hyde park and Notting hill. The rooms were beautifully designed with comfy beds, street view windows, warm floor bathrooms. I enjoyed the English breakfast that I had with my booking and the fact that I was in the city center in a safe neighborhood! 
 I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family and would love to stay there again whenever am I’m in London",5,2022,11,12
103,DON’T RISK! HOTEL OVERBOOKS AND NO ROOM ON YOUR ARRIVAL!,"Arrived at Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel London at 01.00 hrs (hotel advised of time of arrival)  booking was made same day at 17 hrs for a “de Luxe double room” for 2 nights. 
Though staff immediately found my reservation it took them 30 mins  to inform me they had no room “due to water damages from the rain”. They claimed 7 other rooms were damaged as well. I asked to see damaged room as might not have to stop me using room but they did not allow this… You have to wonder of the state of the hotel if 7 rooms have water damage! Thney did not Use Booking.com Message system to inform me.
After 40 mins of waiting they suggested to accommodate me in another hotel 15 mins drive away. I had to insist they pay for the taxi and when I asked them to write the name of the hotel and adress this was not done.
Maybe because TWICE they gave the taxi driver the wrong address on the phone resulting in 50 mins to find hotel until 02.40 when I should have been resting.
The alternative hotel was of similar standard HOWEVER I was given a CELLAR ROOM WITH NO WINDOW (very much Deluxe room I had paid for!) Spent another 1 hour in the street – as no mobile cover in room,  to call Booking.com who of course did nothing as they are so well known for. 
Eventually got to sleep at 3.30 and there here has been ZERO apology, offer of solution and compensation from Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel management and the other replacement hotel for second night was 40% more expensive as booked same day.
DON’T RISK SPOILING YOUR TRIP.",1,2022,11,11

Secondly, the staff is friendly and helpful especially ""Mr. Khazi"" who always has a helping hand and is ready to give you valuable information regarding your sightseeing trips. Also, flight back home was so early - surprisingly, a packed breakfast was handed during the check-out. Really awesome!
Thirdly, the room was clean and comfortable. The bed was big and pleasant. Bathroom though is small but nice & clean.  On top of it, cookies plus packets of tea and coffee as well as bottled water every day.  Breakfast was good with lots of food to choose from and a variety of beverages.
To sum it all up,  great stay & great service.

103,Great location but cozy rooms.,"This was a great location and very walkable even with my 89 year old parents with canes. We walked through Hyde Park to Kensington Palace for High tea and a tour and also walked to Paddington and Lancanster Gate tube station. To be able to go to Windsor Castle and the Tower of London. Whirlwind 3 day trip but we saw a lot. Couple of good food places within walking as well.
Cons are the deluxe room was compact and my husband and I aren’t large people. I can’t imagine how small the compact room is. There was a club room open for cleaning that we peeked into and it would have been worth the extra money for the space. You can choose to add the breakfast for days that you want to dine in. Pretty good options with eggs, potatoes then basic continental fare.",4,2022,10,30
103,Very small room,"Our reservation indicated we would be greeted with candy and fruit yet we got nothing. We got the deluxe room and it was so small that with our luggage, we could hardly navigate around the bed.  Room was clean. Breakfast was good at a reasonable price. Close to the tube. Restaurants in the area within walking distance. Check in was pleasant. Staff was very nice.",3,2022,10,30
103,A Convenient hotel,"We (4 adults, 2 kids) spend nice 4 nights in our 3 clean and well serviced (though smallish – normal for London) rooms. The staff was friendly and helpful. 
The hotel location is very convenient – near to Paddington station and 2 tube stations (Paddington and Lancaster gate) with easy connections to central London; near to Hyde Park. Many small restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood.",4,2022,10,29
103,The best stay in London,"This was such an amazing hotel, I had a great time. The hotel was amazing and the food was also excellent. I had a great stay... One of the best hotels in London. Also valan was amazing and he made my stay super easier and cool ",5,2022,10,29
103,Not for us,"Firstly the staff are very helpful and polite. The hotel itself is not one of the best we have stayed at. For a London hotel it had no restaurant only bar food, which was not a very large menu. The bar itself was not that well stocked or inviting. We had one drink at the table window, this table was vibrating in harmony from a constant noise within the room. At reception and this is NOT stated in any literature about the hotel, several rooms are across the road in a separate building. This is not really an issue but be aware. The room we had in this building was up to a good standard. In the bathroom was a constant sound of flowing water from outside. This could only be heard if you were in the bathroom itself. There is a small fridge and tea/coffee and a microwave!!! Hanging space in the wardrobe was severely compromised by an iron and ironing board which we removed to place some of clothes in it, the rest remained in the case. At night time in the room we had a constant low humming that sounded like an electric motor running. We were only staying for two nights so we decided not to change room for the second night. The view from the window, well we did not have one, it overlooked a semi painted wall about six foot away. The hotel did offer breakfast, this was an extra, a standard breakfast that served us well. Would we go back, most definitely NO. For the cost involved we would expect better. The location of this hotel also involves a 10 minute walk to Paddington station if you want to get into the centre of London.",3,2022,10,29
103,Terrible experience at this hotel.,"Our 15 day train passes were stolen out of our luggage while at this hotel. Despite trying to resolve this issue for several days while still staying at the hotel, we were given the run around by multiple staff members until finally, on the morning we were leaving, we were given a form signed by the hotel, stating that they would be filing a claim with their insurance company to reimburse us for the cost of our stolen tickets. We returned home expecting to hear from the hotel as a staff member had told us we’d need to submit our purchase receipts for the tickets in order for the claim to be processed. In the last three weeks we have sent two emails directly to the hotel and a third email to their parent company and we have no reply. The hotel manager seems to response to these reviews, so maybe we’ll get a response by going public with our issue. 

On top of our stolen tickets, there were many more issues with this hotel. Unfortunately, due to booking a non refundable 10 day stay, we had no choice but to remain at this hotel or lose all of our money. Immediately upon entering there was a strong smell of mildew. We bought air fresher and finally after a couple of days were able to track the source of the smell to the garbage can. We moved it out of our room and the smell was gone. Other issues included both the bathroom sink and shower backing up every time they were used, a non functioning bathroom fan and AC, (we asked for the fan and AC to be fixed, the fan was repaired but the AC was not although we were told it was). As a result, the room was extremely uncomfortable, because even with the repaired fan, it did nothing to suck the moisture out of the room and left it hot and muggy. The carpets were gross, the mini fridge didn’t work properly, the kettle leaked, the safe wasn’t bolted into the closet, housekeeping basically made the bed and tossed ratty clean towels into the room but didn’t clean surfaces or replace any of the cups or mugs, just rinsed them out. One of the glasses was dirty before we arrived and never got removed or cleaned despite putting it into the sink multiple times, There was mold in the bathroom and toilet paper taped over a light in the hallway. We have no clue how this hotel has the star rating it does because it is a total dump. The ONLY thing that was decent about it was the proximity to Paddington Train Station and tube line.",1,2022,10,29

Definitely I will come back again.!!!!!!!",5,2022,10,19
103,Compact rooms are a great bargain for the solo traveler,"I've been to many 4-star hotels in London, and the Park Grant Paddington has been by far the best. The compact rooms are great for solo travelers who don't plan on spending a great deal of time in their rooms. At the same time, the room was in great condition, and was very comfortable. The breakfast is very good, and the staff is terrific. Guilia and Peter were especially noteworthy in being helpful. My one suggestion is that housekeeping might be able to get to rooms a bit earlier in the day, but this is hotel where I definitely plan to return.",5,2022,10,18
103,Great service and hospitality,"Our experience of Park Grand Paddington Court was surprisingly delightful! I'm used to hotels near high-traffic places (like Paddington!) being fairly indifferent to their customer experience, but I was so pleased with our entire checkin experience! We arrived a little before check-in time, but Easterna at the reception (seeing that we had baggage tags on our suitcases, indicating a long journey!) checked to see if there was a room available for us and got us in there well before the official check-in time. The room itself is quite compact but very thoughtfully designed, so you basically have room for everything you need. The workdesk doubles up as a dressing table, and comes complete with a complete media hub (ports for USB charging, HDMI, ethernet, etc.) If I have to stay in this part of the city in the future, I would DEFINITELY try to stay here first before I shop for any other options. Highly recommend!",5,2022,10,17
103,Nice stay,"Maureen is a good staff, warm heart and give us convenience. Nice trip. The hotel location is good also.  Clean room.  Really enjoyed.  Close to Paddington Station.  Very convenient.   Highly recommend.  Look forward to stay again.",5,2022,10,17

103,Excellent hotel,"Myself and my wife stayed the night here as she was taking part in the Royal Parks Half Marathon. The room was spotlessly clean, the staff on reception were very professional and we couldn’t have asked for more. Loads of quirky coffee shops and restaurants within a 10 minute walking distance. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking somewhere to stay within central London",5,2022,10,09
103,Room for improvement,"The hotels in a good location for central London. A 10 minute walk from Paddington mainline/tube & a 20 minutes walk from Notting Hill. Room adequate. I stayed in a single room (B04), bed was comfy and amenities ok. Make sure you bring an eye mask and ear plugs! Due to the room being compact the little green emergency light on the ceiling in this room illuminates everything! It’s like sleeping with the light on! One my second night I ended up opening the wardrobe door to try and stop this light from shining in my eyes! If you’re after a lay in then you won’t be getting one in this room. Every time someone walks through a fire safety door (not sure if it located on the basement or ground floor level), the bang of it closing will wake you up - this starts from around 6:30am.",3,2022,10,09
103,Badly Managed and Dirty Hotel,"Do yourself a favour and avoid this hotel.

Abysmal service: 
First of all, forget about emailing the hotel (prior to arrival), they will just not answer. Upon arrival, and during our stay, I started to understand better why. Reception staff seem uninterested and at times defensive, short and rude. Example, when we notified reception that our room had not been cleaned, we received a stiff and offended response ""oh, so you want your room to be cleaned?"" Absolutely the first hotel in my life where a) room cleaning and tidying seems to be considered a special service and b) seems to be considered to be handled defensively.

Dirty and poor quality:
See attached photo's. Carpets are dirty. One of the worst and largest red stain I've ever seen. The room felt grimy, dusty and in general badly maintained with chipped door frames and skirting boards more the rule than the exception. Moreover, shower had clear mould build up and, despite specific request at reception to clean this, it was simply not done.

Cheap and bad food
Breakfast was an absolute joke for the extra price charged. Beans in sauce where so sugared I cannot but assume they came straight out of a C-brand can. Cheap bread selection - even your local pret-a-manger will get you a better value and flavour for your money.

Luggage storage:
although the doorman smiles friendly and tries to help with luggage storage, it's security is ridiculous. On our final day we came back finding our luggage simply sitting out on the hallway, sitting out of the storage room.

Fake management interest:
Last but not least, I have noticed your copy - paste excuse replies Vinayak Girgune. Please don't bother in sticking one underneath this review with empty promises and a fake interest in understanding better what's wrong at the hotel you manage. Instead I urge you to devote your time and effort instead to clean and fix your hotel, train your staff in even the barest minimum of hospitality, and fix those stairs that - seeing an earlier review photo - must have been damaged at least for some months. It's a health risk and God forbid that nobody trips, falls and breaks something.",1,2022,10,08
103,Good stay,This is the best hotel in London ever I am very thankful to everyone specially thanks to Muneeb he helped us a lot in everything the location and the food of the hotel is also very nice highly recommended ,5,2022,10,08

103,Perfect night ,"The friendly staff is exceptional specially Maureen. They really care about you during your stay there. The room is comfortable, remodeled with good decor. But the bathroom is narrow, not enough for a couple to shower together. Perfect location. Close enough to all monuments and stores. I recommend this hotel. Congratulations to all the staff and thank you for making my stay perfect",4,2022,10,08

103,Fabulous stay with amazing A1 staff,We have just returned from a long weekend at this hotel in London. We probably travel to the capital for several months a year so are reasonably good judges of hotels. This has now become one of our absolute favourites. From the moment we walked in the door from our taxi we were greeted by Valee who could not do enough to make our stay both very comfortable and extremely memorable. My husband happened to mention we were going out later as it was my birthday and she and the rest of the hotel staff could not of been nicer. From breakfast staff to door and night porters the whole experience was delightful and we have already booked to return for a long weekend in December. Thank you once again and we look forward to returning soon,5,2022,10,07

103,Amazing service by Ms Michelle!!!!,"Nice Hotel and amazing staff. The hotel is located very near to Paddington station and has a lot of places near by like Hyde Park, Oxford Circus and Kensington palace. We had problems when we came to the hotel, as they couldn’t find our reservation.Ms Michelle came to our aid and helped us and sorted out the situation in no time. The other staff were also welcoming and helpful. We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues. Thank you so much for this spectacular stay!!!",5,2022,09,25
103,"Convenient, comfortable and cosy","Thank you Valan and the team for a wonderful stay. Just a few minutes walk to Paddington station, Hyde Park, but far enough away to be calm and quiet at night. Lovely breakfast with a large variety to suit all needs.",4,2022,09,25
103,"Great location, good service","Very convenience and fantastic service. FYI, one of my customers had a problem with electricity in his room but hotel staff immediately supported him and us. Clean room was also great. This is why I really want to revisit here!

103,Family Holiday,"All is good! When we arrive, they ask wether we want to change to a bigger room and it is treated as a complimentary upgrade. The room is nice as it is just newly renovated.
You can talk to Michelle as she would be perfectly answered your question.",5,2022,09,24
103,Don’t,"A bunch of very small rooms that are squeezed into a nice old building next to Hydepark for an inflationary high price. Don’t book the compact double room as those are not only compact but don’t even offer space for your suitcase. But especially disappointing is the service. While having lunch in the lobby a concierge forcefully dragged not only luggage but also guests through the hallway which resembled the atmosphere at an airport luggage carousel. But when you really need them, you cannot reach anyone. We waited 40 min for towels the room service forgot to provide and needed to ring 3 times for new tissues, two times for slippers.. if you stay there let the phone ring, it’s their tactic to not pick up.. After all the receptionist force guests at check out to write trip reviews in their presence.",2,2022,09,23
103,My stay at Paddington hotel,"Good, clean hotel with a nice location. I recommend this hotel for anyone staying in London. The price is good and the rooms are clean with excellent service, especially from Michelle. The rooms are bit small though.",5,2022,09,23

103,"Great location, great service, itsy-bitzy rooms","Perfectly located hotel with a very friendly and knowledgeable staff. The rooms are nicely decorated,. However, unless you are traveling alone with a small carry-on, the rooms are unbelieably tiny and cramped... it will be a very tight fit for a couple with two suitcases. And only one side of the double bed is easily accessible. There's really no need to buy the hotel breakfast, there are many great and inexpensive breakfast options around the hotel which, by the way, is very conveniently located between two tube stops and the Paddington station.",4,2022,09,22
103,Only people make this place livable,"Valan & Michelle made my otherwise banal stay worthwhile. Their efforts are commendable in this place that otherwise requires a lot of makeover. Lucky that this place has folks like them. Breakfast has been OK and the location is excellent, being a walking distance from the station.",5,2022,09,22
103,Kazi Was Amazing!,Kazi helped us with all our luggage and was super friendly! I highly recommend visiting this hotel! It was super clean and all the staff was super helpful! I had 6 suitcases and they carried them all up and down from our room upon check in and check out!,5,2022,09,22

103,Great customer service,"Booked an overnight stay in this hotel and was greeted by a lovely woman named Rhian at reception. Who upgraded us to a lovely room with breakfast,  when we  informed her we were celebrating  my husbands 60th birthday,  she surprised us with a bottle of Prosecco waiting for us in our room when we returned later that evening. Great customer service and very pleasant stay at this hotel. Would definitely recommend.",5,2022,09,20
103,Pretty good stay,"Having read the other reviews (and seen the single room our friend got) — I’m a little shocked at how small some of the other rooms are. My husband and I got a Club Double Room (with a queen bed), and yes it’s small by American standards, but pretty OK by London standards. Enough room to squeeze in and out on either side of the bed, room for a mini fridge and microwave, little mini desk and chair, large closet, nice flat-screen TV, electric tea kettle, and full-length mirror. Not somewhere you can lay out a suitcase on the floor, and yeah, you wouldn’t want to spend a lot of time hanging out in the room — but it’s big enough.

The staff are super nice. The location is quiet but central — with an easy walk to the park, to Paddington station, to Lancaster Gate on the Central line, to a little convenience store, and to lots of restaurants and pubs.

However, something about the bed and the small, hard pillows started giving me pretty bad back pain — which is the main reason for the star downgrade. I just can’t give something 5 stars when I can’t get very comfortable at night. The AC wasn’t amazing either (I’m not convinced it worked 1/2 the time) — but thankfully, we were here in September, and popping the window open cooled the room right down.",4,2022,09,18
103,These fancy old hotels look good on the outside but not so much inside.,"The room was advertised as a deluxe twin room when in reality it was a tiny cramped room with two single beds jammed together which in essence was a double bed. There was hardly any toilet paper which is a rare problem and when we asked for more we were given a half role of the cheapest paper I’ve ever seen.  We stayed three nights and the bed was made once which I don’t really mind, but the room was dirty. The curtains need washing and all the old heavy furniture needs replacing. The AC wasn’t working either. We also stayed 4 nights at the Holiday Inn in Southwark. Stay there if you can, it’s got an included breakfast and is clean. This place charges 16 pounds for breakfast but you can get a full English breakfast for 5 pounds at neighborhood cafes.",2,2022,09,18
103,Ss,"Beautiful hotel, clean, nice service

103,Customer Service,"I was on a short stop over in London, Managed to find a last minute deal at this hotel, Since it was a last minute deal i wasn’t expecting much, But i walked into a pleasant surprise , The Location of the Hotel is excellent , Ideal located, about 10 mins walk from paddington station , I was checked in by a lovely lady named Michelle, Michelle made sure my stay was comfortable, and recommended places i could visit and the faster route back to the airport. the staff in general were very respectable and friendly, the buffet in the hotel was alright, When Michelle asked me about it and i mentioned to her about being alright, she got the chef to make me something and deliver it to the room, which was a gesture that was really appreciated, as for the room, Its an European Standard Size room, the room was clean and well equipped, For me its the staff that really makes the difference, and the staff at this hotel Miss Michelle and her Team exceeded my expectations, Thanks for the wonderful stay , I would definitely stay here and recommend this place",5,2022,09,17

103,Friendly and helpful staff,"We stayed here on the 11 th of September for a couple of nights for my birthday .We found the hotel to be clean and comfortable with everything you would need .The staff were welcoming and friendly .On the second night after a tiring day spent sightseeing we decided to try a meal in the hotel .Alan was particularly helpful in organising  a lovely curry for us which was just right and what we needed .
The rest of the staff were very smiley and Khazi on the reception by the door was helpful in getting us a taxi so we didn't miss the show we had booked 
The hotel was a bit far from central London however we had the  advantage of being near to Kensington Gardens were we took a stroll to the large pond with a variety of bird life next to Kensington Palace and therefore it didn't spoil our enjoyment .
Thank you to all the staff for an enjoyable stay",5,2022,09,16

(Excellent attention from Valan and Kazi!)","We've booked 2 rooms (1 compact double and 1 triple). 
Valan received us for the check in and his friend Kazi helped us with our luggage and the way to the rooms!
The hotel is good but the attention is excellent! 
The hotel has 2 buildings. We didn't stay in the main building but it was not a problem. We received all the attention when we needed it.
The compact room is very small (room and barhroom). The triple is larger (both room and bathroom). 
I would come back for sure!",5,2022,09,01

Valan and Maithili your hospitality is remarkable. Thanks for wonderful services.
Park Garnd hotel is lovable place to live. There are good amenities near by this hotel....",5,2022,08,26
103,Dont bank on getting what you have paid for!,The hotel mismanaged their booking system and didn't have the room that I had booked. Eventually given completely inferior room despite being told that I would be compensated they are now saying that because I used the inferior room that completed the booking!! Also they have rooms in their basement which they dont flag up on their website!,1,2022,08,25
103,Grand is probably pushing it. Good or great but Grand....not so sure,Not Grand but good. When I checked in the room I was given was not a Club room that I had paid for. Room changed with no issues and wow what a difference. Probably best size and value in London. But word of warning despite what there website says this hotel does NOT have a club room for club room guests. This was confirmed by reception staff who seem confused when I showed them on the hotels own website. V v v disappointed.,4,2022,08,19
103,Good value hotel,Two nights spent here during train strikes.  Hotel room was very comfortable albeit compact.  Single bed was comfortable and slept well both nights.   Plenty of hot water and shower was very good.  Particular shout out to Valerin on reception.  ,5,2022,08,19
103,Just okay,"Reception area gives off a lovely start and the hotel was ok for what we paid for the night (140 between 2) as it is pretty central. But to be honest i was disappointed.

Rooms are all squished on a corner landing and the room was tiny. I struggled to get down the side of the bed! Alot of stuff was quite torn and run down in the room and it definitely lacked plugs. 

Bathroom was lovely but again tiny

Does have fridge hair dryer iron etc and some custard creams. 

I mean I'm not here to put anyone off i just expected better through reviews and pictures 

8 min walk from paddington straight forward walk, but overall opinion is you can get alot better for the same money",3,2022,08,18
103,AC Didn’t Cool Room in Summer. Stay away if that would be an issue for you.,"Hotel was average on everything and generally acceptable except for the air conditioner was not properly working. The hallway and lobby was cooler than my room, making it extremely hard to sleep in. I would just wake up sweating. I talked to staff about the issue 4 times and were completely unhelpful, each time saying they fixed it and if it didnt work, just call them back and they’ll fix it for real… Well, never happened. I would never visit this hotel again in the Summer.",1,2022,08,18
103,Harish,"Great place to stay! Centrally located. Room is comfortable and  very neat! 
Staff was amazing and especially Mr Valan at the reception went out of his way to look after me. Would definitely come back again.",5,2022,08,18
103,Unhelpful reception staff,"Tried to check in here and was told my reservation had been cancelled as I hadn’t made contact to confirm the card used for booking and they had sent 3 emails, although I had not received any of the 3 in my inbox/junk mail. Was then fobbed off by a male receptionist who was rude and extremely unhelpful, would expect a certain level of customer service from a ‘4-star’ hotel, including help to find a new room instead of being dismissed with a phone number to ring myself. Glad I never stayed if this is what the reception staff are like on first encounter.",1,2022,08,18
103,Nice hotel,"We stayed here for our anniversary. I made the hotel aware of this and they made a lovely gesture to add a nice bottle of prosecco and a bar of chocolate in the room - this was really lovely and a nice touch. We had to wait a little extra for our room to be ready, which was fine - however, the hotel made another lovely gesture of giving us a free drink (each) whilst we waited. This was really lovely and the bar in the hotel was very pleasant too!

The hotel is quite a busy one and the staff handled this really well, there are always many people checking in and checking out of the hotel, which you come to expect from a hotel in London. Everyone is seen to as quick as the staff can handle and we always saw at least 2/3 members of staff on the reception ready to help. The staff were really friendly, informative and efficient. 

We returned back to our hotel in the evening and had been told that the water was off in the local area due to routine maintenance, of what I would expect was out of the hotels control. This was really well informed by the staff and they reassured us that the water would be back on in the next couple of hours, which it was. The water went out late in the evening and really made no impact to our stay.

The building is quite an old one which has been refurbished in communal areas as well as the rooms to quite a high standard. Although the rooms were small, they were very clean and you could see that they are being maintaned well. There were some small issues with the hotel bathroom that could have been cleaned a little bit better, however this did not impact the stay and was not anything massive. We were overall satisfied with the room which came with a fridge as well as a microwave oven. There was complimentary tea, coffee and water in the room as well as tea and coffee making facilities.

We dined in the hotel for breakfast in the morning which was buffet style, this was to a really high standard and the dining area was very pleasant, modern and well kept. The staff kept tables constantly clean and it really showed that the staff worked hard to maintain a high standard. The breakfast again was great and any tea and coffee requested at breakfast was made by the staff and brought out to the table upon request. 

Overall, we were really pleased with the hotel and would potentially look to return in the future!",4,2022,08,17
103,Excellent hotel in a great location,"Great hotel! We stayed for 4 nights and had a wonderful experience! Valen truly went above and beyond to ensure we were happy. Breakfast was wonderful, the rooms were large and spacious, professionally cleaned, and very elegant. Will be staying again when I return to London. Thanks Valen and Park Grand!",5,2022,08,16
103,Miss N.H.Solomon,Kazi was the one who came and received us at the door so very friendly and hearty chap. We felt very welcome by his representation. All our need were met and I will definitely come back and will recommend you to friends and family.,5,2022,08,16
103,Great staff!,"The staff was very helpful with changing a room. There was a little mistake with a great outcome and very professional managing. Thank you very much especially to Andrei, Valan, Daniel and Giulia at the front desk!",4,2022,08,16
103,You pay for the location - but clean and ok,"We stayed here for 2 nights in July 2022 - more for convenience for the Hyde Park concerts. The location is amazing - so many options within a short walk (West End, Hyde Park, Oxford Street etc) and if you are attending a concert in Hyde Park this really is a great place to stay.

We had read numerous Trip Advisor Reviews before booking, so the size of the hotel rooms wasn’t a shock - that said, they really are very small. If you want this hotel as a base for West London exploration, it is pretty decent. It is clean, the staff are friendly and it is well located for public transport.

That said, against such competition in the local area, there are areas that the hotel could really improve on… lift access is poor compared to others in the area, the bar is pretty pathetic - either limited stock or closed at 9pm (9pm!!!!!!! On a Friday night). Thankfully there are options close by

All in all, it is ok - but not worth the price you pay",3,2022,08,14
103,"Perfect location, quitte and warm welcome. Great hôtel.","We spent 3 nights in this hôtel. We asked for à quite room for 3 persons. The room was top even if the second bed was in à coach (could be changed). But the global expérience is great. The hôtel is well situated in the center of London not too far from 2 tube station, the persons are nice and breakfast is of good food qualité.",4,2022,08,12
103,Excellent stay,"Very nice hotel ideally located near to Hyde Park.  Single room small but perfectly adequate for a two night stay with a deliciously cool air con.  Bathroom had a rain shower.
The only criticism I have is on check-in I was told I needed to give a pre-authorisation of £20 but this would not be taken from my bank account.  On check-out I was told it had been taken and it would take 5 working day to be refunded.",4,2022,08,12
103,"Great location, comfortable beds and sparkling bathroom.","The check in is strictly 2pm, but we got a nice clean twin bed room with okay decor and an excellent bathroom. We were welcomed by employee Naval who is attentive and accommodating. We appreciated the service",4,2022,08,10
103,Good stay,"Really good stay, felt very welcome. Definitely would come again, very much recommend! The room was kept clean everyday by the staff, and I specified it was a special occasion and they looked after us very well. 

Thank you",5,2022,08,10
103,Mr Ravi Sachdev,"Very reasonable tariffs given the premium location with station, great restaurants, parks, monuments and Oxford Street within comfortable walking distance. The breakfast spread is delightful and is served with genuine warmth. We received a special surprise on the final night of our stay by way of towel art, boxes of chocolates, fresh roses and a bottle of Chilean wine in our room with compliments from the hotel. Thanks Razvan, Valan, Munib, Maithilee, and Estema for caring and making our stay  even more memorable.",5,2022,08,08

103,Terrible!,"The room was so dirty that I didn’t dare to step on the carpet with socks or bare feet, when I arrived I slid the shoe on the rug for a few centimeters and I literally created a  ball of dust. There was a grey layer of dust on all furniture. The shower drain was blocked so after two minutes the shower tray was full of water. At the arrival the staff couldn’t find my room and  made me go up and down form the building for 15 minutes and said he didn’t want to go back to the reception to ask for help. I know it seems incredible but trust me it is all true! I didn’t unpack and tried to touch the surfaces as little as possible. I stayed the minimum (2days) and then moved to another hotel. One star is even too much for such a place and I paid it as much as other real 4 stars hotels! A nightmare!",1,2022,08,05
103,Mr,"Terrible hotel. Bad cleaning, even found a used condom under our bed. 
They changed us to a room that was already occupied, and even tried to move us across the street into a basement. 
Then gave us back the original room and promised it was properly cleaned. It was not. ! Still just as dirty under the bed and across surfaces. 
All we was compensated was a beer. 
Breakfast was terrible to.",1,2022,08,03
103,Great location and brilliant staff,"Stayed here for 3 nights. The location is brilliant. Within walking distance from 4 underground stations and Hyde park. The staff, especially Valan and Easter were extremely helpful and friendly. Would definitely keep this place high on my list for future stays in London",5,2022,08,02
103,Absolutely fantastic hotel and service in a wonderful area!,"We arrived and the staff hastily helped us with checking in; greeting us in a truly welcoming fashion. Valan was particularly accommodating and helpful and deserves great credit for his professional and courteous manner. The rooms are very spacious, very airy and exceptionally comfortable. The adjustable lighting and heating make for a truly personal and relaxing environment. I will definitely be visiting again.",5,2022,07,30
103,"Noisy, smelly, basement room",I have been allocated a room in the basement. Despite wearing earplugs the noise from doors banging and the bar above is too much to be able to sleep. The smell of bleach or disinfectant is so strong it’s sickening and I have not been offered a wi-fi code. The staff member who checked me in was quietly spoken and seemed unhappy. Not a great place to stay.,1,2022,07,28
103,Lovely time at the Park Grand Paddington,Booked through HotelTonight. 1 hour from booking the room was ready upon arrival. Responsive staff and beautiful room. Perfect for a last minute solo stay. It was wonderful to decompress here after a long week of travel. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2022,07,26
103,"pleasant hotel, reasonably priced for London and good location",spent 3 nights here on 2 of the hottest days.  Much appreciated the air con!  Small but perfectly adequate room with very comfortable bed and pillow.  Bathroom was small but again perfectly adequate and CLEAN,4,2022,07,22
103,Wonderful stay,"My son and I stayed here for 6 nights on a deluxe twin room. Location was great, close to two underground stations, and a short walk from Hyde Park. The room wasn't big but a decent size for the price we paid - considering the hotel's central London location. Room was quiet, clean, and the beds were comfortable.

The biggest asset of the hotel is the staff. From the first interaction, when we got checked in until the last day we had a positive experience. At arrival, we even received a complimentary drink package because we had to wait 15 min for the room to be cleaned. The staff member that checked us in was professional, amazingly helpful, polite and with the most positive attitude. A true asset to the hotel. The two lovely ladies we interacted in the breakfast room went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Thanks to them breakfast service was exceptional. The rest of the reception staff members were always polite and accommodating. All of them made us feel welcome to London.",5,2022,07,21
103,"A complete disaster, flat out lies, weed and weird behaviour!!!","We checked in late Friday 15th July, as we were staying for our anniversary (& also after reading some reviews prior to booking) we opted to upgrade to the club room. I also took it upon myself to reach out via email, to the hotel to ask if I may request a much view…nothing. Not a word. I tried 2 further times but nothing. Not a good start. 
So, we arrive just as a lady is approaching the receptionist to advise ‘the rooms aren’t sufficient and she won’t be staying. But thanks anyway’. Ah. That’s doesn’t bode too well!’
Anyway. We check in. Advised by a friendly enough lady that ‘since we were staying for our anniversary, the housekeeping had left us something special in the room’. That’s sweet and much appreciated. Our club room is 319. We walk up the stairs of reception level, into what I’m assuming is the ‘bar’ (think school canteen with a very feeble attempt of a station they’ve dubbed a bar), to the lift  and into our room. Which was literally next to the lift. Initial impression-it’s very small. This counts as a ‘club double’. If there are room smaller than this…geez. Don’t attempt if you’re claustrophobic. Anyway. Nice touches in the room-rose petals on the bed and a nice bottle of Prosecco. That was nice. I called down to reception to ask about the ‘club’ features I’d read about online. Unsure as to whether this consisted of an actual separate club room, or the amenities were (meant to be) in your room. Bizarrely (& not for the last time, it’s worth noting), the receptionists appear to lose their skill of either speaking or understanding the English language when requesting something?! So, so odd. But we eventually got there and he informed me that there wasn’t a specific room, instead, all the ‘club perks would be delivered immediately to my room because someone forgot them’. Hmm. So we had the ‘fruit platter’ (a side plate consisting of an apple, orange and a banana) plus lots of amenity packs (toothbrush etc)  delivered to our room. I checked the website after, and talk of ‘luxurious bathrobes, daily newspapers delivered, fresh flowers, plush pillows and deep duvets’-utter, utter rubbish. They’re painting a picture that is not depicted in any way shape or form in real life!!!!! Lies. They also steal your spare room
Key when you’re out during the day, so as you can’t leave the air in on!! It was 30 degrees plus in London this weekend. With absolutely no access to any fresh air and they then had the audacity to penny pinch even further and not allow us air con whilst not present in our room!!!! On top of that, when the maid services  your room, she actually re makes your bed and empties your bin (& steals said key). We had 1 tea bag. 1 milk. One coffee. Not replenished once in the 3 days. Every evening upon leaving our boiling, tiny room, the pungent smell of weed that emanated throughout our entire floor, was beginning to make us feel nauseous. Twice I called down to report it. The first time no one picked up. The second they again pretended they didn’t speak English and hung up on me!!!!!! Finally. Saturday night. Our anniversary. Went out for a lovely Italian meal. Returned around half 10 to a banging directly above our room that continued for around 30 minutes before I called down to reception to report if. It sounded like people on a pogo stick, jumping on a skipping rope. It was horrendous. I’ve never had to complain on a trip lbefore-I felt like I’d spent the entire weekend moaning!! Anyway. Reception once again played dumb. Then hung up on me. On the third attempt they promised they’d send someone up to stop it. It did stop around 10 mins later. So there you have it. An honest review as opposed to one’s that are clearly written by staff (you know the ones. They all write the same crap, thank a member of staff and happen to have only ever written one review in their lives!!!) Hmmm. Honestly-I’d never stay there again. They ruined my anniversary!! I’ll be writing a letter of complaint too, although won’t hold my breath for a response. I will though, expect the standard cut and paste response on here, that usually makes absolutely no sense and doesn’t even suit the review in question!!!  It’s a big, all round ‘no’ from me.",2,2022,07,18
103,Avoid this hotel at all costs,"Our experience with this hotel was awful the moment we walked through the door. We stayed four nights. 

Check in - 
Our flight got in late Saturday evening and we did not reach our hotel until almost 11 pm. Tired and hungry, we were checked in by a clueless staff member. We asked him for food places nearby that we could grab from and his response was we don’t know, there is a KFC nearby. He didn’t even mention we had breakfast included with our room and where it was served. We did not find out breakfast was served in the hotel until our last night there. 

Room/housekeeping 
We went up to our room which was  a deluxe double, it was tiny as a shoe box. Barely room for my husband and I to stand at the same time, let alone open our suitcases. Exhausted we just wanted to eat something and go to bed. As soon as we get into the bed, there are stains on the sheets and blanket. There is no sheet barrier between us and the blanket either. I highly doubt they wash the blankets. We called down to reception to tell them and they immediately accused us of spilling something on the sheets. The phone was covered in dust dirty and some sticky substance. They told us someone would send new sheets over, which didn’t come for half an hour. The new ones had stains as well. We were so exhausted we could barely muster up the energy to argue at that point so we just slept on top of the sheets fully clothed. Housekeeping would come everyday and make the bed but that’s about it. Many days they would forget to restock the water or towels, they didn’t change the sheets and definitely did not clean any surfaces. After three days of being in that room, the jelly substance was not cleaned off the phone. 

Staff: 
The staff was comprised of what seemed to be incompetent workers with no actual experience in this industry. There was so much staff but you’d often find them on their phone, or clueless when you ask them a question. 

Location:
The hotel is located in a nice quiet part of London very close to the tube and train station. It is in walking distance of many things. 

The only good part of this experience was speaking to the manager Pierre. He was very apologetic and listen to all of our concerns. He explained the hotel is experiencing many issues since COVID including linen laundry services, staff turnover/incompetence and more. 

Luggage hold:
The “luggage storage” by the way was an unlocked closet of which the door was mostly always open. I’m surprised none of our things were stolen. 

Breakfast:
We had the breakfast only one morning. Food was average, nothing extraordinary. 

Conclusion:
The sheets and towels were cheap fabric, 50% polyester. I can hardly believe this hotel is a four star, avoid this place at all costs. I know I am not alone in these complaints as I saw many other guests doing the same.",1,2022,07,13
103,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"Myself, my daughter and two friends visited this hotel for one night whilst attending a concert at Hyde Park. We booked two double deluxe rooms and at the time of booking we asked for our rooms to be close together.

We arrived at the hotel at approximately 12 noon, understandably our rooms were not ready so we could not check in but we left our luggage and continued with our plans.  We were unable to return to the hotel until late that evening - we arrived back at 11.15-ish to find a full chaotic reception area, this included a couple complaining, a member of the reception staff on the main phone with a mobile phone to his ear, we were completely ignored with no acknowledgement or apology and stood waiting to collect our cases for ages, we were tired and just wanted to go to bed.  When we finally got the attention of someone at the check in desk we were told that unfortunately our rooms were not in fact together or even remotely close, they were in fact in an entirely different buildings! One being in The Devonshire opposite, to be honest at this point we were just happy to be able to check in and go to bed so accepted this.  One of the staff took us over to The Devonshire and left when we got into the room.  The room was small and far from the deluxe double we had booked - as soon as we got in the room there was a foul smell and about a dozen flies flying around the room.  I sat on the bed to take off my shoes and as soon as my feet touched the carpet they were soaked through - the carpet was absolutely soaking wet and on further inspection covered in stains - there was no way we were staying in that room and I cannot believe that they could have expected anyone to do so, it was not habitable. I immediately called reception who told us to go back over to them and they would sort out another room…. 

So off we went with our cases again back over to Reception where we were offered to go back over again to the Devonshire - I refused as had heard some guests and staff talking about a flood over there, which would explain the stinking wet carpet… so it seemed there was only one option left which was described as a ‘very small room’ at the back of reception, Room 001 - at this point I was getting extremely frustrated and tired and just wanted to sleep.  The staff member showed us the room (after knocking the door to check no one was in there!) which was indeed very small so I explained to him that we would take it but I would not be paying the £352 price tag for a deluxe double room and he agreed and told me he would explain to the management what had happened.  It was after the member of staff left and we were unpacking I realised just how small and dirty this room was - the carpet was filthy and needed a good clean and vacuum, all of the sides were exceptionally dusty… there was an empty cupboard where there should have been a fridge and the plug sockets were only working intermittently… In addition to this when pulling back the curtains we had a hideous view of the back of reception. The whole incident made us feel very uncomfortable and sick to the point my daughter wouldn’t even get in the bed, she slept on top fully clothed.

We checked out the next morning fully expecting my complaint to have been passed on to a manager and an apology and a resolution waiting.  No such thing happened - I asked to see a manager and was told to wait in the bar area, I was then left waiting for ten minutes and I went back to reception and someone eventually came to the desk to speak to me. I wanted the matter dealt with and resolved on the spot before I left the hotel but this sadly did not happen.  

I ended up sending an email to the management of the hotel, who have sent a reply apologising and credited us with a gesture of compensation.  However, the amount offered in no way reflected the accommodation we stayed in or the service we received or the inconvenience we were caused. I have since sent two more emails expressing my dissatisfaction and both have been ignored. Since arriving home and checking other reviews for this hotel I see that our experience was not unusual.

I would certainly not recommend this hotel to anyone - I have had much better accommodation and service from the budget chain hotels….",1,2022,07,11
103,Average,"We were moved to this hotel as the other one didn't have the room for us (in another review). 
The room was big enough for the three of us. Everything was clean. There was enough of toiletries in the bathroom.

The location of the hotel is great, near Paddington station. 
I would recommend it.",4,2022,07,10

103,Mr,"We had an unplanned extra night in London and found the Park Grand Paddington Court hotel by chance. What a pleasant surprise.
We arrived after 8pm and Mareen especially, made our arrival pleasant. The rooms were good for the price and so was the breakfast the next morning. The breakfast hostess was friendly, pointed out what was available, and brought us freshly made hot coffee within minutes. 
The concierge immediately assisted with our luggage on arrival, allowing us time to have a really good late night Italian supper around the corner from the hotel. The next morning he again helped with our luggage storage whilst we explored London.
All in all, a good hotel with exceptional staff, making the difference!",5,2022,07,05
103,Average,"Look of the hotel on arrival is smart, found the staff to be friendly but a few things to consider:

a mirror! the only one was in the bathroom 
more milk for hot drinks
shower was weak
a double bed is not a double bed!

The room seemed clean enough , to sum my stay up Id say average, I've stayed in far worse hotels but far better!",3,2022,07,05
103,Worst hotel ever,"After booking a Deluxe Double room through booking.com , we expected a CLEAN  modern room as described in the booking confirmation. After waiting 30 minutes to be assisted, we were finally checked in (at 16:00… room wasn’t ready, even though booking confirmation stated check-in from 14:00). The carpets were horrific and filthy, the air conditioner broken, pubic hair found in the made up bed, a filthy toilet and the room telephone phone was out of order too!

The service received from the front desk was appalling and non existent. We demanded a refund - there was two other couples complaining about the state of the rooms too!

Avoid at all costs!!",1,2022,07,04

103,"Unhelpful staff, falling apart","Other than the location (which can't be beat - near Hyde Park & Paddington Station) there isn't anything about this hotel that I would recommend. The staff here are rude, unhelpful and generally do not care about making their guests feel welcomed or accommodated. The hotel itself is dirty - trash left in hallways (see pictures), carpets in the room were stained and in various areas the carpeting/decor is falling apart (see pictures). The room we stayed in was incredibly small with barely any space to put our belongings away. The bathroom - even smaller! We also did not get a great deal at this hotel, making us feel that we overpaid insanely for the value of the room. Overall, I would NOT recommend staying here, especially if you are staying for several days/nights.",2,2022,07,02
103,Cannot fault! Wonderful hotel!,Friendly and helpful staff. Room 126 was comfortable and very quiet - they even decorated it for our arrival as I had mentioned it was my sons birthday.

103,DON'T BOOK IT!,"We booked a double deluxe room and they were giving us a compact room which was cheaper and we paid for an expensive one. Then they showed us the double deluxe and it was EXACTLY the same as the compact. It is a scam! Don't book it!

103,Great location and comfortable,"Stayed here for 2 nights and it was enjoyable. Though the rooms are pretty small, the beds were super comfortable.

103,very bad service hotel,The hotel promised that the refunding would be perfect but when we arrived nothing was ok. False booking; wrong days they booked  and they let us pay again though we had a voucher for free stay.  They said that they would refund the amount we paid but the hotel never responded to all our mails and telephone calls.   the breakfast they offered was terrible . unbelievable they asked even money for this.,1,2022,06,19
103,"NO response from emails,trying to book.","So I was interested in booking 2 rooms and had some questions. Emailed the rewards club which I joined, and the hotel, and some other contact a week ago and got NO response. I ended up booking but paid extra for the cancellation  privileges' because of their lack of service. Their US toll free number did not work, as well. If anyone has a better alternative near Paddington/ St. Pancras for similar price, please let me know.",3,2022,06,10
103,"Great location, tiny rooms and awful payment cock up","I’ll start with the good points.
The location for the hotel is fantastic, stones throw from Paddington station and not far from Hyde park. Relatively quiet area too. 
Staff are friendly.
Beds are comfortable.
Standard level of cleanliness and new towels daily
Rooms are somewhat modern
Free bottles of water restocked daily and biscuits.

So for the bad points... 
- Booked a duluxe double room which was across the road and up two flights of narrow stairs, no lift.
- The room was unbelievably small. The photos are misleading unless you’ve booked a club room. There was hardly any room to move around and had to stand in the bathroom to iron a shirt in the bedroom. Felt like we were constantly having to climb over furniture to get anywhere. Almost fell backwards twice into the shower just closing the bathroom door. 
- Room is certainly not soundproofed. Single glazed window and could hear next doors tv on. Also them constantly banging their door closed whenever they went in and out the room. 
- Lock on the window was broken so someone could have got in if they wanted to. Also there were certain amenities on the list that missing which were meant to be included in the duluxe room rather than a standard.
- Some of the plugs on the entertainment unit weren’t working such as the HDMI
- Building work going on on the main building. Scaffolding up all over it. 
- despite it not saying anywhere in the terms and conditions and when I booked, they DO take a deposit. In fact they kindly took two off me!! First one was cancelled after a long winded phone call, the second one was ‘refunded’ to me once we had paid the full amount on arrival.. I’m still waiting to get this back. 

All in all, if you don’t mind having a shoe box of a room which didn’t match the description, but happy with location alone, then I’d go for it. But I wouldn’t personally book it again for the reasons I stated above which is such a shame.",3,2022,06,10
103,Un- grande but alright.,"More of a faded grandeur than grand, the hotel itself is undergoing some renovations and is in need of them. The carpets in communal areas are worn and paint work chipped. 

Our deluxe room was just about big enough to swing a cat, although larger pets would be problematic. The double bed was comfy enough though, and the bathroom was amply stocked. Our mini fridge didn’t work but the iron and kettle were fine. 

My main gripe was the hot water pressure which was a just adequate trickle. This didn’t seem to be affected by time of day. 

The staff were universally polite and lovely and a real asset to the hotel. 

The room rate was inexpensive for central London, and proximity to Paddington was very welcome. 

Would stay again but with slightly lower expectations.",4,2022,06,10
103,Good location,We chose this hotel for its location which was excellent for our purposes and approximately a 10 min walk from Paddington Station. Despite the extensive scaffolding the interior was mostly fine. Reception was small but staff were excellent. There is a small bar and fitness room. Some refurbishment is needed for the interior and likewise for the rooms. I felt a mattress protector would have been essential rather than a basic sheet on the bed and possibly a new mattress. We had no view apart from scaffolding but this didn't bother us as we only used the room for one night. There was a fridge and microwave in the room as well as tea/coffee. The shower was good. The room was a reasonable size and clean. Breakfast was buffet style and was nice with a choice of hot and cold food. Once again compliments to the breakfast staff who were exceptional. I think this hotel is nearer a 3 star.,4,2022,06,09
103,Unpleasant discovery after my stay,"I was prepared to leave this hotel a 4 star review until I got home to find I had been double charged for a drink at the bar, and worst of all, discovered jewelry missing from my luggage. I would have still left a better review, however several days after emailing the hotel about it I still haven’t had a response about it. Neither were worth a large sum of money. I was hesitant to even contact the hotel given the lack of value, however the only time the jewelry was left unattended was approximately 2 hours the evening before I left while I was gone out for dinner. Other than this the room was small but comfortable and clean. It was quiet and enjoyable until I discovered the above. Some of the staff seemed fairly incompetent, some were wonderful. Would have stayed again if it weren’t for what I mentioned above.",2,2022,06,07
103,Horrible place!,If you have low standards then you’d like this place! Otherwise don’t waste your money I cannot believe the good reviews it got. We booked the hotel because of those reviews saying it’s clean. It’s actually very filthy. The carpet is old and very dirty with stains all over it. They needed to change the carpet at least a decade ago! The rooms are small and dark with shabby furniture. The check in was a nightmare. There were at least 30 plus pieces of luggage scattered all over the lobby since no room was available for people. It looked like when airports have too many flight cancellations and people are stranded with their bags around them. We waited hours then had to change rooms three times because one was worse than the other. We couldn’t wait to get out of the room every day and would never stay there again.,1,2022,06,07
103,Good Stay,"I stayed here on 2nd June. I had requested a  front street view room, but unfortunately this was unavailable. Furthermore, my room was in the building across the road. The room view was of a wall and I was somewhat disappointed . The room was in a somewhat isolated part of a corridor, I was a little concerned as a single lady traveller. I was escorted to the room by the hotel personell who kindly carried my bag up the stairs.
As I was so tired, I just decided to just settle into the room after a long day travelling.
The room actually was very pleasant. Tea and coffee amenities, fridge and microwave. I could not fault the room, it felt very clean, modern and cosy and homely.It was well decorated.
Staff were pleasant and apologised that I did not get the room I had requested. 
I would recommend this hotel.",5,2022,06,06
103,It's an ok hotel ... too expensive for what it is,"It's an ok hotel, just ok. Looks and feels tired. 
Staff at reception not the friendliest and despite us arriving after the check-in time, our room was not ready until almost 3pm.
Our room was average size but not the spotlessly clean. 
The window sills were dirty as were the windows. 
The plug hole in the sink was bunged with what looked like old shaving foam and lots of hairs. 
Towels looked clean but didn't particularly feel clean or fresh. 
High traffic areas in hotel didn't feel clean, door handles, etc felt sticky. 
Lifts weren't always clean throughout the hotel. 
The breakfast was way below par and served in a not-so-pleasant looking basement. Steps down to basement were narrow and steep. 
The 2 concierge were very friendly and helpful. 
Overall an expensive hotel which is more like an average 3 star hotel.",3,2022,06,06
103,Great staff,"We were super satisfied with Vijay, Edson, Navai and Usman, members of staff, which were very helpful and we would stay again because of their hospitality. Room was very nice as well with big bed and very nice bathroom. Location great. Would stay again. Perfect",5,2022,05,29
103,A home away from home,Brilliant service especially from reception. Had a very pleasant lady called Eastana who helped us. Was very helpful and pleasant. Khazi concierge always ready to assist and be of service. Really felt being at home. A brilliant location and nice comfortable rooms. Definitely recommend this hotel.,5,2022,05,28
103,Good Hotel In Convenient Location,"We stayed at the hotel for a leisure trip to London. The hotel is located in a quiet area, a short walk from Lancaster Gate tube station and Kensington Gardens. It was clean and comfortable and the breakfast was of a good standard but, above all, the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to help was outstanding. Value for money is very good. We will definitely stay at the hotel again when travelling to London.",4,2022,05,24
103,Motel quality hotel,"Booked a Club Room in Park Grand Lancaster Gate, which is around the corner from the Park Grand Paddington Court hotel, because I’d stayed at the Paddington Court hotel (this hotel) pre-pandemic and it was okay but not great. So, when I saw there was another option nearby that supposedly had better rooms, I booked there. Big mistake. After a long day touring London, I checked in to my Club Room room at Lancaster Gate only to find it had only one USB port, which was broken. It also had no digital temp control and a loudly humming refrigerator. 

When I asked for another room at Lancaster Gate, I was moved to this hotel (to the annex, not even the main building). Apparently, the two hotels are really not separate hotels if they can just move people from one to the other, even though the prices are very different. The Club Room at the Paddington Court hotel was downright appalling. The carpet was dingy and stained and just looked so dirty that I didn’t even want to take my shoes off and tried to keep as many of my things off the ground as possible. For a room described as a club room here’s what was missing: washcloths, a chair to sit it (only had a miserable stool), and space to move around - you can’t get to the other side of the bed without smashing your foot against something. Also, the shower had a dripping problem and flickering lightbulbs in the bathroom and the room. The room has a microwave (also the only clock in the room). The hotel has no noise insulation, so you hear everything in the corridor and outside. 

The only saving grace—and why I picked this hotel—is its proximity to Paddington Station and how easy it was to get to Heathrow (via the Heathrow Express) last time I stayed here.

The rooms are comically small and the descriptions and room type labels are misleading. Staying here at the end of what was an otherwise lovely trip to UK was a mistake. Never again.",2,2022,05,24
103,Overbooked,"We were overbooked from another hotel from the same company and guess what? They overbooked us again!!! 
The 4 receptionists on duty did not even have a good level of the English level or how to handle the situation. 
We asked for a courtesy room to get changed while they sorted out the situation and they gave us a dirty used room where they stored luggage from other people.
Compensation? Apologies??? Not at all",1,2022,05,22
103,"Mediocre, but good location","Pros:
The bathroom was nicely decorated and clean, if a bit small. There were two USB charging ports next to each side of the bed which was nice and handy. The staff was friendly and helpful. The price was really good, comparatively speaking. The air conditioning worked well and the building had an elevator (which we didn't use since we were on the ground floor). Security was good since a card key was needed to enter the building at all times.  Additionally, the card keys had no markings to indicate even the hotel name, so they couldn't be easily used if lost. 

Cons:
When we needed something a few hours after checking in (the baby bed/pack 'n' play that hadn't been delivered) we tried calling the front desk and no one answered after letting the phone ring for a full minute. When we finally got them to answer, they resolved the problem quickly and the bed was really nice.  However, the room was really small and the bed barely fit in it leaving us little space to squeeze by between it and our bed. The bathroom lighting was poor and the outlet in there could only be used for a razor.  The only usable electrical outlet was above a pice of furniture they called a dresser, but it was actually a desk with a mirror above it (only two shallow side-by-side drawers). Our TV remote control was he'd together with black duct tape. There were no washcloths in the bathrooms, making it hard to shower without going out and buying something. The bathroom door had a large smoked glass window. Although it wasn't see through, it allowed bright light into the room when someone turned on the light in the night. The housekeeping was marginal. We were there three nights. After the first night, the staff simply pulled up our bedding rather than actually making the bed properly.  When they did make the bed, they insisted on tucking the duvet under the mattress so that you couldn't pull it up past your underarms and it was barely wide enough to cover the width of the bed.  And at the end of our stay I had planned to complete the survey card that had been provided, but there was no pen provided and we didn't have one.  I would've preferred to say all of this to the hotel directly, but it seems they didn't really want to hear it.",3,2022,05,21
103,Great,"Thank you to all the staff, especially the lovely lady on reception. We arrived early to get changed to go to The Royal Garden Party. Our room was not ready as we were before 2 o’clock but she arrange for us to use another room. The lovely men on the door always smiling and helpful. A great hotel just a walk from Paddington Station..",5,2022,05,21
103,"Night staff inexperienced, basement rooms","Our reservation was messed up and we had to sit in the lobby for over an hour while the night staff tried to figure it out.  Finally, the night staff passed the problem to day staff & gave us 2 rooms in the basement.  The next morning the day staff resolved the issues and gave us a nicer room.  After touring all day we returned to the hotel to find our room locked and the night staff made us sit for another hour while the tried to figure it out.  Our bags were in the room and I had to make a huge fuss before they would open the door for us.   More experienced staff is required!  Also they never cleaned our room during the day.  I feel like that is a minimum requirement for a hotel that cost $250 per night.",2,2022,05,20
103,Mixed Feelings,"Stayed here for my 40th birthday, reception and doorman very friendly upon arrival and they allowed us to store our bags so we could go out into the city. 

After we returned later on we got our key and made our way to the room and the concierge kindly brough our bag to out room around 5 minutes later. 

The room was supposed to be a ""deluxe double"" but it was fairly small and they really should rename their rooms as its misleading. The place wasn't very clean, dust on the bedside table, the USB socket in the wall was pushed in so that couldn't be used and the shower tray/enclosures was not very clean at all. the room needs a deep clean. 

Sadly this is not where it ends... The throw that was at the end of the bed looked like it had a snail run over it so make of that what you will.... then after jumping in the shower (poor water pressure) i noticed that the two towels that were provided stunk of grease and had clearly been washed with the chef whites. Reception did put this right but they didn't seem to care really. The view in the room was just a dirty wall so we kept the curtains closed. Didn't bother having the breakfast that we paid for, the fact they can't clean a room properly makes me wonder what the kitchen is like. 

Staff didn't bother mentioning breakfast upon check in neither did they tell us the check out time. 

Its a great location close to Paddington and if you don't mind a bit of dirt then this could be the one for you. Definitely not 4 star like it claims so not quite sure what the AA saw to rate it like that. I wouldn't return.",2,2022,05,17
103,Very good hotel indeed,"Nice comfortable hotel close to the city. 
We chose to stay here for a family trip for 4 nights and found the hotel as a good bargain. The service is top notch - polite and discreet. The rooms, albeit small (like most hotel rooms in London) were clean and well kept and cleaned to perfection daily and coffee, tea and biscuits plus bottled water for free. 
We had two rooms in the adjacent building - one on the second floor and the other at 4th floor and if you are to book a rooom here (and can’t see why not?), as there’s no elevator in the neighboring building, please make sure you’re (physically) ready to climb very narrow stairs with your suitcases, which can be a hassle - but it’s good exercise though. This is why I only give four stars.
We didn’t try the breakfast so can’t review the taste, but I took a peek and it looked nice. 
The hotel is close to Hyde Park and several good restaurants and pubs and in walking distance from Paddington Station (10 minutes tops). 
Can only recommend this hotel and will most
definitely stay here again however only in the main building.",4,2022,05,15
103,Never disappoints. ,Polite staff and good facilities. I’ve stayed at this hotel quite a few times now and is always chosen above others due to the cleanliness and comfort. The location is great a 5 minute to Hyde park and other attractions as well as transport connections. I’ve stayed here with my daughter as well as alone and always felt safe.,5,2022,05,14
103,I am so happy I found this hotel…,"Lovely hotel in an excellent location with beautifully clean rooms.and  staffs are very caring ,helpful, kind and accommodating especially the front desk staff - Michelle. I was originally booked a single, but was upgraded to a bigger room.Great location, easy to get in and out of the city.Wud definitely stay there again .",5,2022,05,05
103,Birthday Stay,"Me and my friend stayed for 2 nights for my friends Birthday. The staff were great in delivering an amazing service. They went above and beyond to make this a special experience for my friends birthday! The room was decorated and we was in a room with a bigger bed and just felt very looked after. Very spacious room which was decorated so nicely! And some special gifts as well as all of this… flowers, Prosecco. This was a memorable stay and we will definitely be staying again! Would highly recommend! Location wise, it is perfect, two short tubes from Kings Cross. The hotel is in a great area, with plenty of cafes and restaurants a 2-5 minute walk away. Shops and everything you need.",5,2022,05,03
103,Great hotel close to Paddington train station,This hotel was great. It was 2-3 blocks walking distance from Paddington train station. It had American outlets which was nice. Our room was across the street from the hotel lobby which was nice because it didn't feel like we were staying at a hotel. The staff were nice and we paid for the hotel breakfast which was good as well.,5,2022,05,02
103,Stay again with Park Grand Paddington,We come back here .Again our stay was fantastic .We come just for one day now and everyrhing was amazing.Room was ready when we arrive and one bottle of prosseco was place on our room.Thank you Dear Staff for your attention.Will be back on our next holliday. I really recomand this hotel from all my heart.,5,2022,05,01
103,Back to the best place,As promised we went back to the hotel. As on the previous date we were greeted with the same warmth and patience. the few minutes late. This time I had a room on the opposite side of the hotel. The room was clean and with everything you need for a stay in London. Thanks to the whole team for all the effort. We will definitely be back here.,5,2022,04,29
103,Birthday Treat,"Just returned home after a 2 night stay here  in room 143 with my sister & it was lovely everything was spot on from beginning to end the staff were very professional & polite in all areas of the hotel & nothing was too much trouble. We will definitely stay here again easy to get to & from Paddington Station. Our room was lovely & clean as was the bedding & the towels were changed daily & toiletries replenished.
Got an upgraded room & from continental to full English which we couldn't fault it had plenty of choice on it all .",5,2022,04,28
103,Deluxe Double Room is Small,"I booked directly with hotel via their web site. Doing so saves me from the hassle of paying deposit and other issues I’ve had with third-party bookers. Hotel was a nice 5 to 6-minute walk from Paddington Station, and about an 8-minute walk to Lancaster Gate Station. Customer Service was exceptional. Denis was a great host and speedily check me in. There was a small mix-up with some amenities, but those were quickly corrected. The hotel was clean but it was a maze to find rooms and the restaurant. My room was cleaned but it was small and tight. I booked a deluxe double room thinking I would have a bit more space, but I didn’t. The shower was very tight and you could barely get in it. Water pressure was okay, but could be better. There was a nice amount of soap, toilet paper and other bathroom amenities. Nice having a mini-fridge & microwave. Really save some $$ on dinner, but plenty of restaurants nearby, plus Paddington Station is near so one can go anywhere for food. Room furniture is a bit dated and starting to show its wear and tear. Bed was comfy and I had a good night sleep, once the music from the lounge or my next-door neighbor was turn off. The view outside was of a disgusting balcony that needs to be cleaned. I kept the curtains closed to keep from looking out the window. Thank goodness breakfast was included with the room because the choices weren’t spectacular. Overall, it was a nice hotel and room, but I don’t think I’ll be back as the room size didn’t justify the room price",3,2022,04,26
103,Great hotel and location,We stayed for 3 nights and it is an ideal hotel for a city break. The rooms are very nice. The beds were very comfortable - one of the most comfortable I have stayed in in a hotel. The room was very quiet. The staff were very friendly. Its a short walk to Kensington gardens and very close to Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate tube station. ,4,2022,04,25
103,Not quite a 4 star london standard expected for minor details,"From making this booking I was happy to see great reviews from travellers. Although as somebody who works in hospitality can agree there are many people out there with bad energy so everything should be taken with a pinch of salt.
However I made my booking with a great price for 2 nights at which time I asked an important question. 2 weeks later just before going yo the hotel I still had not received an answer so choose to email.the reservations department again with no answer. Until the day of my arrival while travelling I start to receive messages my card is not working and they need a check on my details or they would cancel my booking. Lucky I was only coming from the canary islands and was able to sort this matter even though my booking was payment on arrival. Again I asked at this time my original question of which finally I received a reply to call reception they can help me. If that's the case why do you have a reservations team?? 
On arrival my room was although a basement room, impeccable, fresh white sheets, modern and a nice size for 2 people, no safe....no microwave.....points stated to be present in my room type again????
Due to not having a safe on leaving the hotel my first morning awoken by the lovely team of maids outside my room having a little chin wag. I decided to ask for no maid service to the lovely polite morning receptionists. On return they had been in my room anyway????
These points are important to a guest experience with the price and star rating in a hotel even though I detail them have had still a positive experience but not quite 4 star that is UK london.
",3,2022,04,23
103,The hotel delivered,"We had a nice 2 day stay at the hotel April 19th to 21st. Great reception at the reception and all the staff smiled and gave the impression that they were proud of their hotel.
The room was perfectly OK in size and it was well cleaned.
Good English breakfast.
This is not the last time we stay here.
Can heartily recommend.",5,2022,04,23
103,Sightseeing with my son.,One night stay for sightseeing in the Capital. Arrived early and were able to store bags while we went out and about. Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was compact and spotless. Bed was very comfy and had a great nights sleep before a lovely breakfast next day to prepare us for more sightseeing.,5,2022,04,21
103,Good value for money and modern fittings to room (but single room was VERY SMALL),"Booked for ""Paddington Court Executive Rooms"" and on the door of this hotel, was told to go across the street to Park Grand Paddington Court. 

Business trip for 5 days in March. Chose this because of its proximity to Paddington/Heathrow, my work, and the underground. Location = fantastic. Quick 5 min walk to Lancaster Gate Station, Hyde Park, 10 min to Paddington. 

Food in the area gave a very touristy vibe and I wouldn't recommend, picked up snacks at the many bodegas and left the area for better restaurants. 

I would consider staying here again because of the value for the 1) location, 2) newer furnishings of the room (despite outdated hallways/common areas).  Other pros: 
- good sized window (some hotels in this price range may not have a window)
- quiet 
- room has own thermostat
- Staff were able to add a fridge too my room without fuss, by request. 
- Bed and sheets are comfortable, not too soft. 
- Great shower and water pressure 

Hotels in central London at this price are always a hit or miss and this was better than average. Would stay again but in the double room. 

There is a bar area with a few sparsely spread tables to sit and work, have a coffee maybe. 

However, the single room is TINY (see below). You can't have 2 luggages open at the same time. I'm a small person and this was tiny for me. My 6 foot long phone cable was plugged into the other side of the room and reached across the room to the bed (easily). You cannot stand in front of the wardrobe whilst opening both doors -  it's that small. So if you are tall/wide, this (and the bathroom) will be a squeeze. 

There is a bar area where I've sat and done work, which is a good because the desk in the room was too narrow to work at. There were also stairs needed to go from one side of Floor 2 to the other side of Floor 2. Overall, I slept well and the location is great for the price so I would recommend.",3,2022,04,20
103,Weekend Stay,"Stayed in Grand Park Hotel over the 16 April 2022 weekend, Stayed in room 401 and this was clean and spacious enough for 3 adults. The staff were all very nice and service was ok. Breakfast was fine. The hotel is a 5 minutes walk from Paddington station and area felt safe at night. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,2022,04,19
103,AVOID - CASH GRABBERS,"We, like many others, were prevented from travelling to the UK during the Covid lockdown, especially from Australia! We tried to deal with the management of this hotel for a good outcome for us both, but first of all they would not budge from moving our stay from July 2020 to any other time - we could not travel at this time due to Covid! After many emails back and forth, they finally agreed to us staying in August 2021 - however, at that stage we were still unable to leave Australia and therefore had no hope of staying there at that time. They took our money and would not give us a future date when we could stay there. This hotel management obviously puts the almighty dollar (or GBP) before anything and everyone else! 
AVOID AT ALL COST IF TRAVELLING THERE INTERNATIONALLY!!",1,2022,04,18
103,Cheap but not as it seems,"It’s fair to say that this hotel did represent good value for money in a prime location. I also found the room to be very clean and nicely furnished. It was however disappointing to me that I was in a totally seperate building to the hotel and that made me feel unsafe. There were no staff in this side and it just looks like a non-descript house across the road. This was confirmed for me when people started shouting and swearing at 2.30am in the corridor, it was loud and it was unnerving. For that reason I wouldn’t go back as should I have needed assistance there wasn’t any staff in that building.",3,2022,04,18
103,Affordable stay in London,"Good stay for 1 night in London.

Room basic but worth the money, bed was clean and comfortable.

Bathroom was very tight but no problems for a short stay in London.

Location good, 5 minute walk from Lancaster Gate Tube station.

Would recommend for a short stay in London",4,2022,04,08

103,"Modern, clean and well priced!! Excellent location and helpful and friendly staff. Will definitely stay again!!","Excellent stay!! Stayed for 2 nights during the week for a business trip and wanted somewhere which was clean and well priced and we got exactly that. Really nice, modern and clean rooms and a really competitive price. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is in two parts so when we checked in we were told we were actually in the building across the road - this was not a problem though. Location is excellent in terms of being close to underground links - just a short walk away from Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations. Also just a short walk away from Kensington Gardens. I would definitely stay again!",5,2022,03,26
103,Mr,"Excellent place, meticulous, clean and great team of staff always willing to help in any way , with a never say no attitude.

103,Comfortable and convenient 3 night stay,"Hotel conveniently located with 2 nearby underground stops Lancaster Gate (found more convenient on central line) and Paddington. Not far from local cafes, restaurants and Hyde park.

Tea making facilities, microwave and fridge were very handy. There were also Toiletries and 2 bottles of water provided daily.

Convenient left luggage storage. Staff was always polite.  Concierge guy was always good opening door for us . Definitely will stay again for future visits.",4,2022,03,20
103,Park Grand Paddington Court,"We had originally booked a hotel near by which turned out to be very bad, found this hotel in walking distance and they were very kind to help out! The staff is extremely polite especially Maureen at the reception was very helpful with all questions we had as tourists. The hotel is walking distance to the nearest metro (Lancaster Gate and also Paddington), rooms are decent and clean, bathrooms also seemed new and well kept, small but tidy and appropriate for its price. Will surely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a decent stay in central london. Its also walking distance to Hyde Park which was a very good factor for us as we liked visiting Hyde Park whenever we found time on hand.",4,2022,03,19
103,This hotel was a LIFESAVER,"Hotel Park Grand Paddington Court was our hero and saved our trip. The hotel we originally booked scammed us and was disgusting. We had to hotel hop at 1 am until we arrived at Park Grand Paddington Court and luckily they were able to take us in. This hotel was so great! The staff was super super nice and attentive, the rooms were clean snd cozy, and the location was amazing - close to so many tube stops and in the most beautiful neighborhood. Would definitely recommend snd stay again!! Thank you Park Grand Paddington Court, you are the reason our trip ended up being so successful!!! Amazing value for your money.",5,2022,03,12
103,Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel,"The hotel was located very well, close to Hyde Park and walking distance to the city center as well as Oxford Street.  Good breakfast and the rooms were fresh and nice. The service was very good as well.",5,2022,03,11
103,A life-saver in London,"I’ve never written a review for a hotel, but Park Grand was such a great value and experience that I couldn’t imagine not! After a harrowing experience at a different hotel, we came into the lobby at 1am desperate for a room. While they couldn’t get us a room that night, they were so helpful and supportive, and we checked in for the rest of our trip the following afternoon. The service was exceptional, the room modern and clean, and the location ideal. Given our experiences at the previous hotel, none of these things are universal in the area. I can’t recommend this hotel enough, and I’m sorry that we didn’t have the foresight to book it originally!",5,2022,03,11
103,Fantastic trip to London,"My Granddaughter and I stayed at the Park Grand Hotel, Paddington Court, recently.
We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Our rooms were spacious, comfortable and very clean. We felt safe and relaxed at all times. The staff were pleasant and courteous. The reception. front of house, staff, Nellie,Petronela and Maureen, were most engaging and helpful. The location is ideal for Paddington Station. This gives great access to main line and underground transport services. I'm sure we will be staying there on our next trip to London.",5,2022,03,09
103,Awesome Hotel,"The hotel is excellent. The people working here are extremely nice and polite. Good train conections. Tottally recommended.

The room was very clean when we arrived. The breakfast is nice, they offered you multiple options. 

Michelle in particular was so nice and made us felt so comfortable here.",5,2022,03,06
103,Best hotel ever!,"By far the best hotel I have stayed in in london.
Nothing was to much. The staff are so welcoming and accomodating,it's unreal.

I’ll definitely come back here for any future trip to London",5,2022,03,06
103,Wonderful stay,"I just stayed 8 days at Park Grand Paddington Court. I have to say I absolutely loved my stay there.

First I was there to celebrate anniversary and after this holiday in London.
They made the room so nice with chocolate, wine and rose flowers by arrival. I were super happy and we loved this nice decoration and surprise. 

Everyday the reception and the rest of the employees always were nice and friendly if I had a question.

I ended up booking 2 more days.

In the reception I spoke to Petronela, Nelly and Michell and also I tall nice guy I cant remember the name of. I want to say they were SO NICE AND HELPFULL and they made me feel so welcome that next time in London I will absolutely stay at Park Grand Paddington Court. I stayed in a deluxe room which was very nice.

I also like the area a lot. Close to Paddington Station, Tube Lines, lots of cosy restaurants and cafes.

Also outside the hotel there are lots of rental bikes if you fancy a nice bike ride in London.

THANK YOU TO ALL EMPLOYEES AT PARK GRAND PADDINGTON COURT HOTEL 😊",5,2022,03,01
103,Two day family visit to London for half term to see the sights.,"Great hotel. Very reasonably priced just off of central London near Kensington Palace Hyde Park and Paddington 

Looks nice when you come in the receptionist very helpful Pretronela. Went through the details with us showed us lifts to rooms. 

We booked a deluxe double and a Deluxe Twin. The rooms were well appointed, soundproofed, they had the feel of rooms you get in a more upper market hotel. 

Both rooms were very similar. The beds were comfortable to sleep on. We had breakfast in the morning which was fine, 

Would recommend this hotel to stay at for central London visiting.",5,2022,02,22
103,Very pleasant stay,"My experience at Park Grand Paddington Court is one of my most comfortable stays in London. Very friendly and helpful staff. Would come again. 

Only inconvenience would be the call centre, as it is centralised with the operating company - it takes some time to be connected. 

Besides that, everything was up to par!",5,2022,02,18
103,Excellent,Its was a pleasure to come to London because the bedrooms was comfortable to sleep in and everything was clean and we would like to visit again. Soon  and  all staffs was all polite many thanks Aaron and amy and Ann,5,2022,02,16
103,City Break,"Hotel was very welcoming.
the room was a good size, very  clean, with good facilities, and most important of all a big comfy bed.
The staff were very polite and helpful.
Great location as it was a couple of minutes walk from Paddington station, and was a easy walk to The Royal Albert Hall for the show we had booked.
We are looking forward to going back.",5,2022,02,10
103,Mr Agostino silvestro,"The reception allways very kind and super helpful 
Very happy to stay at grandparkpaddingtoncourt 
Highly recommend for any stay porpoises trip 
 I stayed in several hotel’s in the area but yes!!! 100% dis was the best , thank you 🙏 guys",5,2022,02,10
103,Return Visit,"When I wrote my previous review in 2017 saying I ""will return"" I didn't anticipate it would be quite this long, mainly due to the events of the last two years. I'm pleased to say it was another good stay. I had to book the day due before due to an emergency situation. I did the normal searches and the Grand Park Paddington Court was competitive for what I required. I wanted to clarify some points and spoke to the very helpful Nevin, from the Reservations Department on Tel: +44 (0) 20 7479 2266 / Email: reservations@parkgrandlondon.com. 

Reception were friendly and helpful, please note you need to show proof of identity so ensure you have some with you, I had my Driving Licence, its something you could get caught out on.  The room (518) and shower were really good with nice touches such as the night lighting.  It might sound a strange thing to say but having some small things like a bottle of water, tea and coffee, biscuits are nice touches that some hotels don't provide. The deal included continental breakfast which was a nice start to the day, as you probably know breakfast can cost £10 - £15 per person in some London Hotels. For me the hotel is very well situated, a short and straight forward walk from Paddington Mainline Station (and the Paddington Tube Stations) and also Lancaster Gate Tube on the Central London. If you are a tourist you have several options to get to Central London in less than 20 minutes.

103,Perfect Customer Service and a Great Hotel,"The customer service that I received was second to none, every member of staff offered to help me celebrate a birthday by providing an extra service free of charge to ensure that the day was made extra special. I would highly recommend coming here, especially because it is great value for money. 5/5",5,2022,01,31
103,False Advertisement,"Me & my husband originally booked the Park Grand Hotel Paddington, but upon arriving at Paddington, we find that the hotel is not open, for refurbishments. There was no signage to let us know of this. We walked down to Park Grand Hotel Paddington Court & they didn't even apologise. They said that the hotel was closed because of refurbishments, that's it. They said we could stay there the night, but the room wouldn't be ready for a little while, which was fine.
My husband initially booked a club room, which was a little bit more expensive. When we arrived at the room, it was definitely only a compact room. When we asked the reception about this, they said that there was nothing they could do & that they know that the rooms are smaller than advertised & that the management was ""sloppy"" about uploading actual pictures of the rooms. 
Lastly, they said that breakfast finished at 11:30, when we arrived at breakfast at 11am, we were informed that breakfast had already finished, so another waste of money!

Definitely won't be returning.

103,Not a bad base for a weekend away,"I booked two compact double rooms for two nights (Friday & Saturday) for my wife and I, and our two long-time friends. Just to give a bit of background; we are two married couples, all of us are in our sixties, have all been travelling together for over thirty years and in this time we have stayed in many hotels ranging from three to five stars throughout a good portion of the world. This hotel is rated as four stars, but after having stayed there we all agreed that we could not figure out how it managed to attain that star rating, as we would certainly not rate it above three stars, and to be truthful we have stayed in better three star hotels. 

We booked this hotel through Booking.com, and the reason for choosing this particular hotel was mainly due to its proximity to Paddington Station, but the room rate of £62.42 per night was obviously quite enticing for a four star hotel so close to the city centre.

When we arrived we encountered our first minor inconvenience. I had already noticed that the hotel had put a hold on the two rooms by requesting a deposit from my credit card of £124.84 a few days prior to our stay. At the front desk on our arrival they took a payment of £124.84 from my card for our room, and then went to take another payment of £124.84 for the other room. When I inquired as to why, when the total should be £249.68 and that the hotel had previously taken £124.84 from my card, I had no idea what the member of staff was on about in answer to my question. Now every member of staff we came across obviously did not have English as their first language, so along with my Scottish accent, their grasp of the English language and the fact that both parties were wearing face masks it became increasingly difficult to figure out what was going on. In the end a manager was called who tried to explain the situation, but again this was fairly well lost on me. The only way I could happily proceed was to check my credit card on the app on my mobile where I saw that the correct amount had been debited, so was fairly happy that I was not being overcharged. It was only later when I looked at the credit card receipt did I notice that they refund the initial payments then take the full amount. If this had been pointed out by any of the staff members, then our booking in would have gone so much more smoothly.

We arrived at the hotel at noon, which was much too early to book into our rooms. All that we were intending to do was drop our bags off in the baggage room and then go into the city, but give the staff their due they told us that they had a room prepared that we could get into immediately, and if we wanted rooms together we could get the other room later on that day. This was a real bonus, so full marks to the hotel for doing this for us. It meant that we could drop off all of the bags in the room and then get into the city straight away.

Later that afternoon we arrived back at reception and encountered yet another small inconvenience, in that the staff could not really understand that all I wanted was a key card for the room that had been allocated to me. This was even more irritating as it was the same member of staff that had been dealing with us no more than four hours previously. 

Although we had briefly been in our friends room earlier on that afternoon to drop of our baggage we really did not have any comprehension as to how small the room really was. They really are compact in every sense of the word, and I would never book such a room again. I don’t think that the standard room was much dearer, but oh how I wish I hadn’t been such a skinflint and had paid the extra for the bigger rooms. To be truthful, the photos that I had seen regarding the compact rooms did not really represent truly how small they are. Within around half an hour of us getting into our room I had banged my shin so badly that it drew blood, and over the course of the weekend there were quite a few expletives said, mainly by me, whenever a body part came into contact with any of the fixtures and fittings, which was quite often.

The rooms may be small, but there is everything you need in them – tea making facilities with kettle, iron/ironing board, laptop safe, hairdryer, microwave, mini fridge and large flat screen TV. The bed is just a normal sized double, but it has a comfortable mattress and good quality bedding/pillows. There was only one beside table as there isn’t enough space to fit another at the other side of the bed, but we managed to get the dressing table stool by the window which gave a surface to put a mobile etc. There are plenty of power points, so no difficulty charging our devices. There are also plenty of options for lighting the room, but only one side of the bed had a reading light. The room was air-conditioned and this worked quite well for keeping the room warm as the temperatures dropped outside.

The en-suite was a fair size, with a large shower cubicle. There were also plenty of free toiletries and the towels were large and good quality. The floor of the en-suite was also heated, but be careful with temperature selection as it can get very warm. The shower worked well and there was always plenty of hot water.

I didn’t use the WiFi, so cannot comment on that, and did not eat at the hotel, so am unable to comment on that also.

We had a slight problem with the room in that we had a large sticky stain on the carpet which we reported at reception. Again it was difficult to make myself understood, and even although the member of staff we spoke to said that he got it, he came over to us as we were leaving the hotel and asked if we wanted housekeeping to clean our room, so obviously my long, detailed explanation of the problem was lost in translation. Again another member of staff came over to help, and we thought that she understood, but when we returned, some six hours later, our room had been cleaned, with new bed linen, new towels and replenishment of the tea making stuff and toiletries. The only thing that hadn’t been touched was the large sticky stain on our carpet. We did our best to try and clean it off, but it was going to take more than our wet wipes to remove the stain. We did make it less sticky, so not so bad if you accidently walked on it in bare feet. By the way it wasn’t us that did the stain – it was already on the carpet when we got into the room, so not too hot on cleaning the rooms when a guest has left.

We left the room around nine a.m. on Sunday, and as we weren’t due to get our train for a number of hours we requested that our cases were kept in the baggage room, which was not a problem at all.

At the price we paid we still think that we got good value for our money and would almost certainly book the hotel again, just not a compact room. The staff are friendly enough, but sometimes I felt that I was on holiday in a totally different country to the one that I was born and bred in, as the language barrier made the stay more difficult than it really should have been.",3,2022,01,13
103,Overnight stay,"I booked this hotel on my way to London as part of a last minute overnight trip and after reading the reviews I was dreading what I might find on arrival. 

I had no issues at all during check in, which I was pleasantly surprised by having only booked an hour before! 

I was directed to my room and did find the hotel layout a teeny bit confusing but nothing major. 

Room size was OK for an overnight, enough storage if i was staying longer, good facilities in room. Bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. 

All staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful and I popped out a couple times and they greeted me on return each time. 

Happy with my stay and would book again",4,2022,01,12
103,Fabulous visit!,"Me and my partner booked to stay for two nights in January 2022 as we had tickets to see two shows in london that had previously been bought for christmas presents. 

We paid £157 for two nights breakfast included and i have to say it was money well spent. We arrived two hours before check in and was instantly allowed to go up to our room. The room was very spacious and clean. Fresh sheets and towels provided as well as two extra pillos as requested as i am 20 weeks pregnant.

The staff were all very pleasent and polite and nothing was too much trouble. 

We paid for breakfast to be included in our stay and my goodness it was delicious. The continental breakfast was all fresh and with plenty to choose from. Full english breakfast was also included much to my fiancès delight and was also very tasty. Again staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant experience.

If i was to make any criticism at all it would be that i found the bathroom was very warm but at times the room itself was a little chilly however that being said i am a very cold person anyway so diving under the covers of the very comfortable bed solved this.

Thank you for a great stay and we will definitely be returning for future visits.",5,2022,01,09
103,Great service,"Very comfortable and a great staff. Aolso the reception very helpful.

103,A Classy Stay At Paddington!,"In the midst of a very busy and tiring day, 
We arrived at the hotel a bit early before our check-in time. The staff was very warm and welcoming to us. Since the rooms were still being cleaned,
Michelle (the Guest Relations manager) offered us hot tea/coffee with delicious cookies as well as storing our luggage for us.
Despite the fact that we were tired, we enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere at the hotel. The feeling of being at home was overwhelming.
We were escorted to our room by the concierge who explained everything about the room. Additionally, he made sure that we read the safety instructions while we enjoyed our stay.
I was very impressed with the hotel's beautiful, comfortable, well designed rooms.
The hotel had very friendly and helpful staff that took excellent care of our needs during our stay in London.",5,2021,12,16
103,I wouldn’t return,"Not the best experience at this hotel, to begin we go to the checking and was waiting for a good 45 minutes to check in. When we got there the welcome wasn’t the best just got told to sign a piece of paper and then wait in the bar for a reason we still weren’t told. I had previously told the hotel we were coming for an anniversary but sadly we werent welcomed nicely. It was my first time staying over night in london and I have to say it didn’t meet my expectations, I don’t think I will be coming back there due to the unwelcome staff",2,2021,12,11
103,Visit for winter wonderland,"Absolutely diabolical hotel. Cancelled 10 minutes before I arrived and said there was no room for me to have leaving me stranded in london. Absolutely shocking customer service, would never recommend ever again.",1,2021,12,11
103,Staff rude. Location ok. Hotel dirty. Rooms tiny. AVOID!!,"Booked through Booking.com back in August for our trip to Winter Wonderland. Price seemed decent considering the location (just a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station). 

First problem was with my card details. I changed them on Booking.com and it was passed through to the hotel however they tried to charge my old card details for the card authorization (which obviously failed). Called and tried to explain as I was worried my booking would be cancelled... a couple of hours later after finally getting them to understand my concern I received a call and they took authorization details and an amount of £250 from my new card and confirmed my booking. This was the day before we were due to arrive.

Next problem was at check-in. Bare in mind they had already taken the full amount for pre-authorization they then asked me to pay the full amount again at the hotel. The money that they had taken the day before hadn't been returned into my bank account however they insisted that NOTHING had been taken. The only way that they believed me was by me showing them my account and that the money had been taken (I shouldn't have to do that?!). Unwillingly the lady at reception then refunded the pre-authorisation amount which popped back into my Monzo straight away and then charged me for the room. The employee that served me had a really bad attitude as if I was trying to get away with not paying.... the money I had in my account was for my spending at the weekend NOT for paying for the hotel room a second time. I'm unsure I know many people that would be able to easily pay for their hotel twice and still have spending money whilst on a weekend away in London?! 

After this was sorted I thanked the lady, at first she ignored me but on second attempt she did give me a 'smile'. Again, appalling attitude. 

Second problem was finding our room... there are a handful of rooms on the second floor which have no lift (we weren't asked if this was ok and we weren't offered help with our bags), and you have to walk through the first floor then up 3 more flights of stairs. After getting lost, my boyfriend went down to find someone and they took him to the room and then met me at the lift and took me to the room. 

The corridors on the stairs STINK of cigarette smoke. At times we could also smell this in the room. As well as this there was dirty laundry and rubbish left all over the stairs, one even blocked our door and you could barely get through it with bags. We checked in at 7pm... surely this would've all been cleared in the morning?! 

Rooms are TINY. Don't bother upgrading, you don't get any extra room. Shower didn't drain very well which meant you have to have the quickest shower before it overflowed. No TV remote in our room and a few stains on the bed. 

Had to wait almost an hour for an ironing board, iron and the tv remote to be brought up. Went down twice to ask where it was and offered to take it up ourselves to be told that they were already on their way up (they weren't). Eventually arrived at 9.30pm. 

To be fair, 2 stars is probably too much. Overpriced for what it is. Wouldn't recommend for anyone to stay and won't be returning. You'll be much better staying somewhere further out and travelling the extra 10/15 minutes in.",2,2021,12,07
103,Cancelled 10am the morning of stay,"We booked this hotel for our visit to winter wonderland, 2 months in advance. Once boarding the train received an email to saying they cancelled, no one replied to emails trying to resolve, be wary when booking the hotel. Very disappointed how the dealt with us when we arrived and had to fork out another 180£ To just have a place to stay. Absolutely Appalling.",1,2021,12,05
103,Avoid.,"Less than one star. The original hotel we booked was closed when we arrived. No one had told us that it was closed. We were taken to the Park Grand Paddington Court instead... And told that they couldn't find our reservation... We waited a whole hour... As to which they told me that I myself had cancelled my booking... Which I hadn't. It then turned out the company I booked with accidentally booked twice and cancelled one but kept the other on. They couldn't locate this booking. They then came up with a different story... That they contacted me and offered me their sister hotel at Hyde park and that I refused to stay there and cancelled it but this was also not true. We were never contacted, not once. They never gave us another option. They didn't even contact us and tell us that our hotel was closed. They didn't refund our money either. 
They demanded more money to stay in a sister hotel... Park Grand Paddington Court. So we paid this money as we had waisted 1 hour 30 and had somewhere to be. The staff didn't have a clue what they were doing or what was going on. I escalated this my travel company management who stated that the booking was not cancelled and they have said (this hotel) we refused to stay there. Why would we travel 4 hours+ away from home to a hotel if we had refused to stay there? Later on as we returned to the hotel and staffing had changed to night staff... A gentleman on reception told us he located our booking. He has refunded the money from the second booking we were forced into and he is sorry but sorry isn't really good enough given that the hotel we booked for costs double the poor standard in comparison hotel we ended up staying in. This hotel is much smaller. Rooms are tired. Our bedding was dirty... the pillow case actually had something crusted on to it. The pillows were evidently old and flat and need replenishing. The walls are paper thin, we were kept up until early hours of the morning whilst the neighbouring room was having a party shouting and screaming and banging ordering room service. 
The breakfast was good. That was about it. As we checked out we saw a couple and a man on his own... Going through the exact same thing as us above and the couple were actually in tears as they left. The management are lying to customers and trying to bully them into believing that it is all their own fault and that they cancelled or paid for a different hotel when they didn't and it's actually their fault and their own closed hotel causing problems. Totally would not recommend the whole chain. Would not book for any of my clients either due to poor customer service.",1,2021,11,29
103,***AVOID - DO NOT BOOK***,"***AVOID - DO NOT BOOK***
If I could give this zero stars, I would, that is what it deserves.

I received an email less than 24 hours before check in, it said my booking was transferred to another hotel due to a maintenance issue. When I rang the hotel they did not have a booking and had cancelled it due to an invalid credit card. There was nothing wrong with my card and they had accessed my bank account to do a pre authorisation. Nobody was answering the phone at the Grand Paddington. I managed to speak to a Receptionist at the Grand Hyde Park, I had a look at reviews online, there are many recent reviews on booking.com with other people with similar issues and saying the Paddington was closed. After questioning, the Receptionist said that the hotel has been closed for a long while. I said why have I only had an email less than 24 hours before check in if that is the case? She said she has told the reservation team to stop taking bookings for a closed hotel as it is wrong and she has to speak to people that complain. They are clearly doing this to maximise bookings, transferring people and then cancelling if over booked. I had tickets for trains and Winter wonderland in London. Fortunately, I managed to pay a little extra and get a hotel at very short notice, so my trip wasn’t completely ruined, other people may be less fortunate.
Booking.com said they are going to investigate but the hotel is still open to do bookings today, even though the Receptionist at Hyde Park has said it is closed. 
Please save yourself the heart ache and stress, avoid this shambles of a hotel chain!!!!",1,2021,11,28
103,AVOID THIS HOTEL By far the worst hotel ever stayed in,Tried to charge us twice on check in for the room and couldn’t understand why we wanted a refund. All of bags was removed from our room whilst we was out at night Time. Had to go to reception 8 times because the key wouldn’t open the door. All staff have no clue what they are doing. Made us change rooms twice. Windows broken in the room whilst -2 . Mucus all over new towels when entered the room. Made a pregnant woman climb 5 flights of stairs as lift broken and then wouldn’t allow us in that room so made us change,1,2021,11,28
103,Avoid!,"I only gave this hotel one star because I had no option to give it zero. Our stay was disastrous from the moment we arrived. We were under the impression we had booked a ""Deluxe Double Room"" as described on the website only to be given a room that was so small we had to climb over the bed to get to the other side. When we complained to the manger we were told it was not possible to move us to another room till the Sunday (the last day of our stay) as they were fully booked. Although we were very unhappy we had no choice but to remain in the room given to us. Our next nightmare was when we asked at reception where we went for breakfast only to be told that the dining room was closed and breakfast was to be served in a paper bag to our room. Nowhere on the website does it mention this. If it had I would not have booked. Apart from the fact that this was in a acceptable there was no way we could have eaten our breakfast in the room as there was no physical space to do so. We would have had to sit on the bed to eat it. (There wasn't even bowls provided to eat the cereal contained in the breakfast bag) Once again we complained at reception only to be told by the manager that we had the option of going round the corner to the Park Grand Lancaster and have breakfast there. We were not told about this when we asked and we witnessed reception staff telling more than one visitor that breakfast was continental and served in the room. (No mention of this anywhere in the website booking page?) Our nightmare continued when we returned to the hotel on  the Sunday afternoon to move to a different room. The room we had been allocated hadn't been cleaned or made up. The beds mere unmade and the room contained rubbish from the previous guests. To cap it off, it was a twin bedroom and not a double. They hadn't even been able to move our bags between rooms as promised and it took some time for staff to recover them from our previous room. Our experience at this hotel completely ruined our visit and I would not recommend thus hotel to any future guests. AVOID!",1,2021,11,14
103,DO NOT BOOK! HOTEL IS OUT OF BUSINESS!,"I echo everyone else’s reviews when I say I wished I’d checked Trip Advisor again before leaving for London! Arrived at the hotel to find the sign on the door saying it was closed. No one is to be found inside and it’s closed up shop! They give you a number to call- but if you’re a tourist and don’t have a cell phone plan for England, what are you supposed to do standing in the street by yourself with no one around?? Lucky we had a plan so we called the number that’s been disconnected!!! A week ago I was writing to the people at the reservation center to confirm my reservation and everything was fine. Or so they said!! But it’s a main reservation center and apparently even they don’t know what’s going on. STEER CLEAR AND STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!",1,2021,10,12
103,Scam artists DO NOT BOOK HERE,"If I could score zero then I would. I booked this hotel via Wowcher
 Booking was confirmed by Wowcher and also by the hotel when I telephoned them on 30th September 2021. I have a recording of the conversation. Then today I receive an email saying there was a ""technical glitch"" and my booking should not have been confirmed as they do not have availability and also there is a ""technical issue"" with the rooms. I am now in process of trying to get a refund which is proving extremely difficult. From reading other reviews it is clear this hotel is a scam, they clearly knew full well they could not honour my booking. According to other reviews the hotel has been closed for months. Not a bad little money earner eh? £134 of my money they have for naff all. When you call, be prepared for a lengthy wait and then when you try to explain the problem  they simply put the phone down.
I will be taking this further",1,2021,10,01
103,Avoid at all costs. Closed without notice.,"This Hotel Park Grand Paddington Court was completely closed due to ""maintenance issues"" when I arrived at 11pm. I received no advanced notice whatsoever despite having booked a month in advance. No one even bothered to answer the phone number on the door. My many emails and phone calls have still gone unanswered. 

I would recommend avoiding all Shaftesbury Hotels (shaftesburyhotels.com) given how astonishing badly this closing was handled.",1,2021,09,30
103,Hotel Closed - Avoid,I booked this hotel one week ago before the planned visit to Park Grand Paddignton Court so that gives plenty of time to be told by anyone within the business that the hotel has in fact been shut for 2 months. When i arrived there was a note on the door saying the hotel is closed and to call the number on the note. We called it and after 20 minutes of being on hold we got through to a very rude and unapologetic man who only told us we had been transferred to a hotel 15 minutes walk away. Awful experience avoid at all costs.,1,2021,09,03
103,Loved the stay,"The hotel reception was nice as we entered loved the food the receptionist ,Vince &bogdan were amazingly good I would recommend this place always , they gave us comp continental breakfast the rooms were clean everything was so nice , thank you",5,2021,08,29

It is situated at a perfect location near to all amenities and places to visit. 

Definitely looking for another trip soon in future.",5,2021,08,27
103,Covid cash grab,Booked to stay at this Hotel last June. Had to cancel as we are still not permitted to exit Australia. I advised the hotel several months before our arrival date that we were unable to travel but as the booking was non-refundable was refused any refund of our five day booking despite my suggestion that it be treated as a no-show and we were happy to  forfeit a day at whatever was the going rate. We had booked in at eight hotels for our European trip and this is the only hotel which has refused any refund. In a pandemic or a war there are always those who will use the opportunity to take advantage of the situation to advance their coffers. We are old age pensioners who value every dollar (Pound) and judging by the other reviews we are one of countless others who have been exploited by Park Grand Paddington Court. We are not to blame for Covid-19 but it would appear that this hotel can hold us to account through no fault of our own. Five days booking cancelled months before due to Australian Government policy to forbid travel out of Australia and yet this stingy hotel pockets the full booking for no service whatever. Shame on you Park Grand. We have lost our faith in England and  will not be returning.,1,2021,08,19
103,Hotel booking changed without notification,"I booked this hotel just a couple of days before going to London. When I got to the hotel there was a sign in the window that said the hotel was closed due to maintenance. There was a phone number to ring that wasn't answered when I tried it. 

Eventually, I realised they had another hotel around the corner and met another person who had been moved from one of Park Grand's other hotels. 

Really poor, avoid.",1,2021,08,17
103,Birthday,"This was a booking transferred from before the pandemic as they wouldn’t give us a refund. So eventually agreed to book a night for my birthday this weekend . We had to travel up to London from Dorset, pay for 24 hour car parking, only to find the hotel boarded up and closed with only a tatty piece of paper on the door saying hotel closed and to phone the call centre. Needless to say we were devastated. No-one answered the phone from the call centre so we ended up having to frantically book a B&B somewhere else. There was also another couple there who had also turned up with no warning of the hotel being closed. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! No excuse as they could have contacted us but no warning at all.",1,2021,08,15
103,"Thank you, especially Kanisha","Great trip, great visit.

We arrived a little late in the evening after an exhausting day of travel. But I have to tell you that Uncle Fred was out of his wheelchair, hopping around, smacking his ears and moaning gleefully, once he recognized Kanisha’s welcoming face at reception. What a scene of joy! No problem, Kanisha leapt to the rescue with a mop, fresh nappy and plenty of air fresheners and all was soon good as new! Kanisha really went above and beyond this time. From directing us to a great family-oriented restaurant,  to recommending the best local sites to visit, to setting up Uncle Fred’s cage in the closet, she knew just what we needed. 

What is so incredible is Kanisha’s service was so amazing that all of these other visitors were motivated to create an account on TripAdvisor just to give this hotel 5 stars! Kanisha is a real London treasure, worth a visit!",5,2021,07,25
103,Average quality ,Our reservation was transferred from the Westbourne Terrace hotel to Devonshire Terrace which we were happy to accept knowing that guest numbers were low. We did however expect a fully functioning hotel which we didn't get. The restaurant was closed and we were asked to ring reception in the morning to arrange room service...that's when we found the phone in the room didn't work...the lift was also out of order. Hence the average rating. ,3,2021,07,18
103,Great location - Great customer service,"We stayed in the hotel and the location is superb.   Very close to hyde park, paddington station, edgware road etc.  Also found the hotel to have very good customer service.  Vallee in the front desk was particularly helpful and nice.    Also value for money is definitely there.   We  live in the UK and will go back to the hotel when we go to London.   The only pet peeve was that the gym was not open.",5,2021,07,05
103,Cramped & disappointing.,"Originally was meant to stay at the Hyde Park Location but was moved to this location.

I paid for a club double room ended up with a cramped double room. Which is backed up by the Park Grand website & Trip Advisor; as the pictures of the double rooms matched the room that we had been given.  

Asked one of the reception staff - who said my room was a club double but that clearly wasn’t true. So not only had we been moved from our booked hotel, the room we were staying in was downgraded to what I had booked. 

Really disappointed with my experience as it was a birthday treat but been left completely frustrated. Was really looking forward to trying out Park Grand Hotels but I have no intention of going back after this experience. Was shocking. 

Only pros I can think off are the beds are comfy and clean & it’s in a good location for getting around London. 2 stars is generous.",2,2021,07,01
103,Excellent Customer Service,"Stayed 2 nights for business meetings.
The check-in process went smoothly with a prior request to upgrade to a Club room already processed. 
The room was very clean and spacious. 
All the staff we came across were very kind and accommodating. 
Reception staff were very courteous. 
Had the English Breakfast option and everything was cooked perfectly. 
Will definitely stay here again.",5,2021,06,27
103,Pleasantly Surprised,Had a lovely two night stay. It’s quiet and well hidden from the hustle and bustle of London’s traffic. The customer service is excellent throughout the hotel.  I’d definitely visit again and refer guests in future.,5,2021,06,27

103,Vincy (the manager) made our stay fantastic.,"Vincy made our stay absolutely fantastic. I could not recommend this place enough. We came down for a quick trip to London, booked our location last minute, and were met with nothing but a pleasant experience. The room was comfortable, and the service was great. Thank you!",5,2021,06,04

The rooms I stay in are pretty basic but have everything I need and are always clean. The team that works here are all really polite and helpful.",5,2021,06,01
103,I love the hotel! I looooooove the staff,"I give a 100% and a 100 starts to the staff members at the hotel. The receptionists, Vinzi and Michelle have been the best receptionist I have encountered. They go above and beyond to ensure your stay is comfortable and worth your money. The food staff, Katia was extremely welcoming and understanding to everyone’s requests. The housekeepers like Ann and her team were extremely hospitable.  Anything you are unhappy with? They will immediately attend to you. Some of the luxury hotels I have visited do not have such an impeccable customer service. I will return a hundred times more and I recommend you to visit this hotel too.",5,2021,05,31
103,Exceptional Service,"Exceptional service, from kanisha and riana. Problem occurred resolved very professionally.The service is with a smile.The rooms are clean and tidy.Breakfast was great.I will definitely come back again.",5,2021,05,30
103,Honeymood,"The staff was excepțional, i was transfered from Grand royale hotel to this one. At first I was very disappointed as it was not what I had booked. But when I got there the young lady, Michelle  promised us an upgrade our room for the second night, she also made sure it was decorated and with a bottle of champagne. It was beautiful and I really appreciate the effort us making our stay special. I’d prefer booking at park grand for next time. Thank you!",5,2021,05,28
103,Great service,Loved our last minute stay at the Park Grand. Amazing customer service at the desk from Kanisha. She made sure we were comfortable throughout our stay. We will definitely stay again and try out the other branches when in London.,5,2021,05,25

103,Great stay,"Would highly recommend! Due to relocation, they offered my breakfast to my room. Was so close to Kensington gardens and amenities. The staff were lovely and accommodating. Due to covid the gym was unfortunately closed but the staff were really helpful and would stay again",5,2021,05,20
103,Nice staff- rooms are small.,"I had booked to stay at another hotel and turned up to find it closed and being directed to this hotel. 
The staff are lovely.
The rooms are tiny, and the Hotel is a maze and it appears that where ever they could they have made a bedroom, I asked to be moved! the staff did there best.
The rooms are all very similar and my’n had a nice bed and the shower was excellent.
Breakfast was continental and presented to you on a tray in the dinning room.
The location is close to Hyde Park and there are a couple of nice restaurants, but not much else in that area.
Tube stations are 10 min walk to Bayswater or Paddington(in opposite directions).",3,2021,05,19
103,Excellent service and staff,The hotel rooms are really comfortable and the staff is really welcoming and polite. The breakfast was really good. I have to mention a staff member at the reception named vincy who was really helpful and made my stay at the hotel easy and hassle free.,5,2021,05,19
103,Appreciation of staff,Visited this hotel back in October 2020! I must say the place is super clean and well behaved staff! Vincy was very helpful and provided an amazing service from check in to check out! The hotel took good measures in terms of covid by sanitising the rooms and keep it clean ! Had an amazing time and stay kn this hotel! Highly recommend this place! Cant wait to comeback 👌,5,2021,05,19
103,Good hotel,"I loved the hotel.The first room wasnt confortable but when i changed the second room was excellent.Breakfast was very good.Reception personnel very polite.
I will hopefully visit again when i come to london",5,2021,05,17
103,Excellent staff and service,Good location. Great rooms and service. The staff were very helpful and considerate. They accommodated any requests we made of them. Because of this we would definitely consider staying here again in the future. Very good value for money.,5,2021,05,17
103,Amazing Stay!,"I was very satisfied with everything about my stay. - The showers were lovely and hot, the bed was extremely comfy, the room in itself was great and it is such a perfect location when coming to stay in London. I would absolutely recommend staying here, 10/10! :)",5,2021,05,14
103,Lack of Customer Service,"I was originally supposed to stay in May 2020 unfortunately due to COVID we were unable to make the trip. A couple weeks before I called the hotel and I asked for a refund but they suggested that we can move the dates. Knowing that I most likely will visit London, I agreed and tentatively booked for beginning of May 2021. 

When I rescheduled, I asked a couple of times if I can get it in writing of the confirmation the rep said ""no, don't worry, the notes is right here in the system"", so I said fine. A few months later, I called to confirm that the booing is still there and they confirmed and I said what happens if there's still a lockdown etc. they said to call back as close to the booking dates.

Well in late February, I called because after staying on top of what's going on in London the hotel restrictions were still in place at least until mid-May, which unfortunately our booking dates were before then. I asked for a refund and the rep said to email the manager who was at the Chilworth (part of the hotel group), followed up a couple of times and no response. 

I was able to get all of my refunds except for this hotel. 

I would never again book at any of their hotels that's part of the group. They just steal your money and vanish.",1,2021,04,20
103,No reply to any emails,"We booked and paid for 5 nights for August 2020 , we l8ve in Australia and can't travel.We were told after a few emails and a phone call we could change our dates through to September 2021 as long as it's done by December 2020.I have sent 6 emails ,written on their Facebook page and private messaged them , not even one reply.
5 nights paid for ,all we want is to change dates.
This hotel has taken our money and now won't reply to us.
We felt so grateful when they gave us the option to change dates but I guess they were just trying to stop us annoying them .
So angry now it's such a lot of money.
Stay away from this hotel.",1,2020,11,30
103,Absolutely not recommended,"I had booked two rooms for two nights and paid in advance almost 1000 Euro.
The hotel was closed due to Coronavirus on our travel dates. It took two months to get my money back, nobody answered my emails and it was almost impossible to reach someone by phone. In the end, I had to go through a complaints process with Booking.com as the hotel refused to give the money back.
I would never book this hotel again",1,2020,09,10
103,STAY FAR AWAY,"This hotel and the management  are crooks. Please stay someone else . They take your money with a smile but do not hold up their end.
So frustrating so find another place  . Certainly not a place to stay",1,2020,07,29
103,Great hotel for the budget!,"Excellent hotel, very friendly staff!! Located near train stations and bus stops. Plenty of amazing restaurants and the hotel itself serve high tea for those who wanna experience English high tea! Rooms are a little small, but is clean and has their own private bathrooms. We had a great time here. Will definitely come back.",5,2020,03,19
103,It was just Okay,"We were originally in a small double which is extremely small. The bed is pushed right up to the window. Our points scheme offered a fruit platter on arrival and complimentary upgrade. Neither were provided. Once we asked we were given only an apple, orange and pear. We asked about the upgrade and they blankly refused, but called us back 5 minutes later to say they had arranged an upgrade. The club room was much more spacious and I would recommend booking this room for a couples break (also long stays as it has a fridge)
All aspects of the hotel look tired and needs a refurb. The smaller room was a little unclean however the club room was very clean.
They served a good breakfast with a variety of choice.",3,2020,03,15
103,Great hotel,"We stayed with my girlfriend in a delux double room. The room is quite small but you have everything what you need for 2 nights . The hotel staff is amazing , they helped us to book tours and during the stay they were like our personal assistant. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family . If you want to stay more than 2 nights book a club room , they r more spacious . Special thanks to the duty manager for allocating my room on the top floor where we had a view .",5,2020,03,15
103,Holiday,This hotel is a good hotel and I’m enjoying my stay here which is very cool and relaxing also there are many local stores around the area which is very helpful and easier I also love the toilets in this hotel,5,2020,03,15
103,Wonderful stay,"I stayed in this hotel for a few days, it was a beautiful discovery.  Excellent location for business and leisure travelers.  The rooms are clean, the breakfast excellent and the staff wonderful, very professional friendly!",5,2020,03,15
103,Terrible Customer Service,Absolutely terrible customer service. I asked them to cancel my reservation because the US GOVERNMENT has restricted travel from UK due to COVID-19 and if I go there I can't get back home in the US. All they said was their policy doesn't allow for change/cancellation of non-refundable reservations. They have no common sense or understanding of the current situation. You really get to know a business during hard times and they're one that you MUST AVOID.,1,2020,03,14
103,Good location ,"We stayed for 2 nights, first room we were in was very small but clean and cosy. There was a bad smell coming from the bathroom which we later discovered was a blocked shower drain, but we were moved rooms with no issues to a room twice the size. 
Heated floors in the bathroom, hairdryer, microwave, kettle and iron all available. 
Breakfast was great with many options for everyone. 
5 minute walk to Hyde Park / Lancaster Gate, lovely pubs and cafes nearby. 

Great value for the price and I would recommend to any friends travelling to London. ",4,2020,03,12
103,"Horrible Experience, Will never be back.","I work in the hospitality industry (Front office manager In Carmel California) and I won't ever write a review, I always look to resolve the issue but the team was not interested in doing so, at least this way this will reach the Executive team along with Ownership. 
I mistakenly booked this specific property where as I wanted to book their sister property at Hyde Park. Within minutes of booking it, I contacted Expedia & The property in order to have it either cancelled (while i rebook) or move my reservation to the other property. Reservations decided to use the corporate language of You booked a non refundable non changeable reservation. I work in the industry, WE do make exceptions specially when contacted within minutes. I tried 3 times and 3 times they would not accomodate. I asked for their Front desk manager & Director of rooms emails, all they did was read my message and ignore it. Yes, I understand both properties are minutes walking apart but I have my reasons for booking that specific location. i.e : reviews, Location comfort, 
That is already not the best first impression before even checking in. 
The room was a shoe box, nothing out of the ordinary. I could have booked at EasyHotel and saved a bunch. 
Small bed, attached to the window which has isn't well sealed allowing cold air go in.The heater did not work the first night. 

Leniency is a very important factor in our business. When you practice that, you gain their loyalty. When you have people from industry stay with you, you have to take care of them because it is family. 
Whenever i stay at any hotel, once they know I am industry I am recognized more than anything. Could not care about an upgrade or an amenity, the recognition matters. 
Hopefully the GM, DOR, FOM or even Corporate sees this.",1,2020,03,10
103,Great for the Price,"Convenient location with clean rooms, friendly service, and competitive pricing.

The hotel is a 5 -7 minute walk from both Lancaster Gate and Paddington Station, so it's very convenient. The Paddington Station area can be a little hectic but this hotel is far enough away that you're insulated from that. The neighborhood is safe and easily walkable to some very good restaurants and grocery/convenience stores. 

Rooms are a little small but that's to be expected in London, especially with this type of building that was previously residential. Rooms are clean and relatively modern. Pictures always look better than reality, but all things considered, it's an excellent value for the money. This helps greatly if you're a tourist, but keep in mind that the city is huge and you are roughly 30-40 minutes (walk + train) away from most of the common sights.",4,2020,03,10
103,We have tried many other afternoon teas and this is without a doubt by far the best -PERFECTION,"We just love this afternoon tea and have found it brilliant, the food is plentiful (we struggled to finish it!) but is so tasteful and freshly prepared it is absolutely delicious. On arrival we were greeted by the delightful Alisha and shown to our reserved table which was by the window ( a plus point for me) She asked us if we had any food allergies or health problems which would affect what we could eat - have never been asked that at any other venue and was a very nice touch. When she bought the tea she explained what all the items were (we had the Indian afternoon tea) a really lovely lady who was perfect, friendly but not overpowering and made us feel very relaxed. Coffee was plentiful (we don't drink tea) and Steve the waiter was very nice and kept topping up our prosseco and also oferring more coffee when our cups were empty. The coffee here was superb I am a bit of a coffee snob and rarely comment on the quality of coffee but this was really worth a mention. We were not rushed and had a perfect afternoon. There is absolutely nothinng I found to be negative. The toilets were immaculately clean as was everywhere else. One silly point I have just remembered the napkins were the thickest I have ever used. This was our second visit and we have already planned a third later this month",5,2020,03,10
103,Lovely,"The room was small for my expectations but it’s okay for London . The allocation of the hotel is very convenient and nice . The staff is really nice and polite . I find very heart warming that every member from the hotel stuff is smiling and polite . 
I’ll definitely recommend this hotel to everyone who loves a peaceful nice hotel .",5,2020,03,08
103,Great stay in London,The location is perfect and 5 mins walk to the park and subway station. The room is quite and comfortable as well. I really enjoy the stay! The food is good as well. I def will recommend this hotel for sure.,5,2020,03,07
103,Smallest room and poor service - Avoid!,"I have often stayed here, the hotel is close to Paddington Train station so in a god location and a short walk. The rooms have always been on the small side but this time around I was put in a broom cupboard. There was just about enough room to open the door and get into bed. It was ridiculous. The rooms are tastefully decorated, but it was freezing. I went to the restaurant for food in the evening, there was nobody there and not a staff member in sight despite waiting for a while. Overall a really poor experience that means I will not be returning again.",2,2020,03,06
103,Excellant,"Loved the hotel walking distance to underground lots of pubs nearby for a great dinner or lunch, staff at front desk very friendly and accommodating rooms were ok a little small but thats London, booked 2 rooms they were nice but on the street level so when you look out your window you see people walking by it was like a basement. 
I didn't like that and asked to change the rooms but the Hotel was sold out.  They accommodated us by giving us free Breakfast every morning 3 days, it was very good.",4,2020,03,06
103,Tourist holiday,"Absolutely marvellous stay. First rate facilities, with staff from those on the front line right down  to the cleaners who were friendly,helpful and made you feel welcome. Steve, the barman gave excellent service. 
Will certainly use this hotel again next time we're down.",5,2020,03,05
103,Superb,"Great location and only a ten minute stroll to the nearest tube station. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Staff were friendly and helpful, room (though small) was well appointed and comfortable. Very quiet and peaceful and would definitely stay again. Overall a very positive experience",5,2020,03,04
103,"Great location & service, a little run down",The service is outstanding and friendly. The hotel is looking a little worn inside (as most hotels near Paddington are). We stayed on the -1 floor and minor warning about that floor: it seems to be mostly a smoking floor. The hallway smells of smoke strongly (our room thankfully did not). Although I plan to stay somewhere else next time this location is a reasonable value for the price.,3,2020,03,02
103,60th birthday,Treated by daughter for couple days as a birthday treat .. Staff went out of there way As we walked into our very spacious club hotel room there were balloons a rose a little  cake and chocs on the bed and some wine The room was nice and light. Our  beds were so comfy ..and dif lighting either u could set it at day or night! large tv perfect to watch from our beds there was coffee/tea kettle etc.. fruit water all in room plus not that we needed it a microwave .. an iron which came in handy and of course a powerful hairdryer ... The bathroom was just lush ..underfloor heating a large walk in shower with a powerful shower nice thick towels plus besides the main large mirror was a lovely lit up magnifying mirror .. Breakfast was amazing both of us had a fry up each morning every thing u could think of was there .. plus the option of continental or cereals or fruit massive selection of different breads .. On day 2 my daughter was able to have poached eggs cooked fresh for her .. We requested some xtra coffees and milk which was bought to our room immediately... We couldn’t fault any of our stay at the Grand Park Paddington Court .. and when I visit London again I shall definitely be booking to stay there again .. Should also add how quiet at night it was and our room faced on to the road  with deep black out curtains ..,5,2020,03,01
103,"Amazing experience, Good service, Good ambience",Went for Indian inspired afternoon tea with my girlfriends. Perfect place. Not too crowded. Staff is very friendly and they serve you with a friendly smile. Good food. And the quantity is enough as well. I loved the selection of desserts.,5,2020,02,29
103,"Excellent place, good location, great service, great room for nigt recovery","My wife and I stayed for 5 days. The place is 3 blocks away from Paddington so we directly arrived from the airport to the hotel on one train, no transitions. The front desk service was very polite and they heard my wife and I were celebrating 20 years of marriage. So he made sure the stay was special. The room was comfortable and warm during the winter so we slept so comfortable. I really want to come back",5,2020,02,27
103,Indian Inspired Afternoon Tea,"We were given a Christmas present of having an Indian Inspired Afternoon tea with Bubbly at Park Grand Paddington Court.
It was a easy walk from Lancaster Gate Tube station.
We had a really nice time,with attentive waitresses and excellent food by the Indian chef.
The selection of food was very tasty including delicious pakoras,chaats,indian style biscuits,asian flavoured sandwiches,a rose favoured desert,tasty carrot-based kheer and gulab jamon.
Everything was tastefully done,with lots of masala chai as well.There was a varied selection of other teas available too as well as a bottle of Prosecco.
We hope to come back again with our family members next time.
A really lovely and very satisfying Afternoon tea!",5,2020,02,27
103,Lovely staff and beautiful hotel,Stayed 2 nights with my partner and must say that the reception Alexandra was very helpful. She made sure that our stay was comfortable and every need was met. She went beyond by helping us to find good restaurants. The hotel is in lovely location and overall it was great.,5,2020,02,27
103,"""Very good hotel and perfect service""","The hotel location is just perfect, the underground station is less than five minutes walk and the rates are real value for money.The staff at the hotel are really helpful and pleasant, especially the girl at the reception who has a very positive and professional attitude. I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends. Thank you guys!",5,2020,02,26

103,Lovely stay,"My Husband and I had been given a gift to visit the Shatd and a meal, to extend our day we searched and searched for a reasonable priced hotel with good reviews. Well the reviews were true. Such a warm welcome upon arrival. And then later when we returned to the room such a wonderful surprise of small gifts, the room its self was comfortable,  very clean and the little added extras were great.  Breakfast the next day was plentiful and delicious. The staff really do make this place a fantastic place to stay. Thank you",5,2020,02,21
103,"Brilliant staff and food, rooms were beautiful and the bathroom floor is heated.","We had a long stressful day as our original booking didn't work out, we had three children with us and hadn't a clue were to go.

103,Wouldn’t return,"The hotel was ok. It was clean, which is the main thing I would ask for so I can’t fault that. Everything was just a little bit dated and could do with a freshen up. When we checked in, it took 4 people and they all just stood looking blankly at the computer, making us worry that we had no room. Once it was sorted they were friendly. Although the room is described as compact, I wasn’t quite expecting a 4ft bed and a bathroom that you could only sit on the toilet if you were 5ft 8 or under. The breakfast the next morning was really good though.
Our stay was average and we wouldn’t return, but it was comfortable and clean enough for 1 night.",3,2020,02,19

103,Decent hotel ,"Stayed here when stuck in London due to storm Ciara! 

Was nice enough, the room was comfortable and clean.  There was an air conditioner or something right outside the window, which might not be the hotels fault but it was annoying.

We had a deluxe/club room which was nice, don’t know what the normal ones are like, it was decent but not amazing. 

Good location 5 mins from Paddington and 15 to Marble Arch at the top of Oxford street.",3,2020,02,12
103,Amazing,Everything was absolutley spectacular. The staff was friendly and helpful. Altough the breakfast should have more variety. Location is good and there are shops and restaurants nearby. The room was great.,5,2020,02,12
103,Great Stay in London,"I've had a very comfortable stay in the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel. The room was very clean, the location great and the staff superb. I am going to stay here again next time I am in London! They've also mailed my key back to my home address, because I forgot it when I checked out. Great service!",5,2020,02,11

There are a lot of good restaurants close by
The staff is phenomenal special touch for each guest 
The concierge staff Andrei was very helpful 
The receptionist crystal very quick and pleasant 
Will come back for sure 
Recommended to everyone to stay here",5,2020,02,09
103,Comfortable stay,"I spent 4 comfortable nights in this hotel. The hotel is perfect for a business trip, close by tube and Paddington station. Barely 5 min walk from the gorgeous Hyde Park, a lot of restaurants and pubs close by. They have 2 buildings, one with lifts and another without. I was given room in a non lift building but other than that everything was great. Will surely stay again. ",4,2020,02,09
103,Afternoon Tea,I went for afternoon tea with family and had a great time. The service by Christina and Andrea was outstanding. They were great and helpful throughout our visit. I highly recommend! Thank you very much.,5,2020,02,09
103,Great location & excellent service,"The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance from Paddington Train Station and Tube Station; getting to the city center is quick, and you get to save on accommodation costs. The staff was very polite and prompt — I would totally rate them a 5 out of 5.",4,2020,02,06
103,A great value stay in London,"Hotel rooms in London can be very disappointing so it was wonderful to be pleased by the room I had reserved.  Yes, it was a cozy twin but was not uncomfortable for 2 adults to maneuver around.  It was very nicely appointed, had tv, refrigerator, microwave and a kettle for tea/coffee.  The bathroom was very modern and for tall people, it was great that the toilet was high off the ground!  The room was very clean and neat.  The staff was very nice and accommodating, especially Andrei, who stored my luggage till my room was ready and then carried it up to my first floor room.  Located 4 blocks from Paddington Station, a good location and away from the hustle and bustle of the station area.  Was very satisfied with my choice and my stay was great.",4,2020,02,05
103,How Accommodating! Loved it!💖,"When I need a upgrade from my terrible hostel, I decide to go to this hotel and what a fantastic decision that was! I was looked after as a solo traveller and will definitely be staying here again. Loved the big selection for breakfast, fast wifi, gym, super (SUPER) friendly staff, big bed and it’s right next to Hyde Park!!!
THIS HOTEL IS A MUST!!!!!! 💖",5,2020,02,01
103,Lovely place ♥️,"Really nice place, this is my second time here. Great location, few mins away from the station. The staff is so nice and friendly and offer a great service! Definitely recommend it! Will come back for sure!!",5,2020,01,31
103,Very good stay,"The hotel has good services and facilities and the rooms are modern and very clean. The staff is really helpful and nice. Good breakfast service.

The only disadvantage of this hotel is that not all of the rooms have access through the lift. Some you only can go through the stairs.",4,2020,01,30
103,Nice ,This is a nice hotel/cozy for winter season. Located at a nice location. Tube station also near .. taxi service available easily. Didn’t had any issues during my stay. Staff in housekeeping are hero’s ,5,2020,01,28
103,Birthday weekend,"Every member of staff we encountered was very friendly and helpful. Upon finding out we were there to celebrate a birthday, they even send us a complimentary bottle of prosecco to the room.
Room was very clean, and the breakfast was delicious. We asked for vegan sausages, which they gladly cooked to order. The serving staff was attentive without asking every two minutes if we needed anything. There is complimentary coffee and pastries in the lobby in the morning and hot chocolate in the afternoon. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back! 
Thank you!!",5,2020,01,26
103,Weekend in London,"Perfect location and service! Friendly and professional staff. Room is good, with all the necessary facilities. The hotel is located around 5-10 mins away from paddington station (by walking). It is also walking distance (5-10 mins) from hyde park and Lancaster gate station making central London quite accessible!",4,2020,01,26
103,"Pleasant, convenient. 3.5-4.0 stars.","Old but renovated row houses, appear to have once been multiple buildings now under one roof.  Near several High Street restaurants as well as Paddington rail and tube stations, convenient if taking morning Heathrow Express train.  Very small room even for London, both suitcases had to be placed on the floor, but it was nicely appointed and bright. Pretty nice bathroom amenities, and nice to have free bottle of wine and bowl of fruit in room upon arrival. Relatively quiet except for hallway sounds, but guests did observe quiet during the night.  Service was polite and attentive.  Breakfast buffet offerings include traditional full English dishes, if that's important to you, but we prefer a la carte or small ""continental"" breakfast; to our knowledge, these latter options weren't available. The room heat did not work well, it was very cold and heating system is ultimately controlled by the Front Desk despite control system in our room, so 3.5-4 star.  Be careful to note there are other hotels with on the street with somewhat similar name, but Front Desk personnel kindly made sure we checked into the right hotel.  Would we stay here again? Possibly, yes.",4,2020,01,25
103,Memorable Trip,"I’ve been in this hotel with my girlfriend to celebrate a special occasion. Honestly, the staff really made it special. I really appreciate the location, as it was very central and well connected. The staff at the reception exceeded our expectations by always being willing to meet our needs. I would definitely be back and I highly recommend this place.",5,2020,01,22
103,"Incredible service, but ruined our idea of boutique hotels","Summary - service is impeccable, but it can’t make up for an outdated building with very small, uncomfortable faulty rooms. 
Zero counter space in bathrooms.

It’s tough to write a negative review, but in this case, I have to make sure those travelling with more than two people should be aware. 

I chose this hotel specifically because I was looking to accommodate three adults. 
When I arrived, the host gave us a room across the street, which was weird, and on top of that showed us a room clearly meant for two. When I asked where the third bed was, they pulled out a sofa bed that felt like metal nails when laying down.

I asked to be switched because this was completely unnacceptable and I felt like they had been deceitful considering all pictures showed a third single bed for three adults.

They moved us to a room that had three beds and all was fine. Until we woke up the next morning with a LEAKY roof dripping all over our luggage.

We called down yet again and was moved to a similar room with a letter of apology and some treats. 

What would’ve been more appropriate is if we received a partial refund. We have never moved rooms SO many times in one hotel stay. We’ve never been subject to a leaky roof. It was a complete circus.

The rooms and building, though remodeled, are still very cramped and old. 
Our “new” room was fine until the bathroom lights started flickering and the sink would clog up if the water ran more than 30 seconds. 
At this point, we just gave up on letting staff know because we were exhausted with the whole situation.

We’ve always thought boutique hotels would be lovely because there are less people and supposedly better service. But we realized small hotels also mean spotty building standards overall.

Sadly, we will not be returning here or staying at a boutique hotel ever again in the future.",3,2020,01,22
103,Fantastic stay,"I spent 3 nights in this lovely hotel in the Paddington area. The breakfast was included and it was really good. Rooms were ok and cleaned.?The closest Underground station (Lancaster Gate, Central line) is in a walkable distance and Hyde Park as well. I stayed here for my birthday and the management prepared me a nice surprise in my room. Thank you everyone for made my birthday special",5,2020,01,22
103,Indian Inspired Afternoon Tea,"We had a lovely experience at the afternoon tea session. Alisa and her team really work hard and provide the best customer experience one could ask for. 
They take care of all the dietary requirements with utmost care. 
The spread offered on the Indian Inspired version is truly scrumptious and a few items have a nice modern twist. 
I can't wait to be back.

Thanks a lot Alisa and team.",5,2020,01,21
103,Very friendly staff,"I spent a delightful five days in this hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially Roxana and Alisa from the breakfast room, and also all the other staff. The room was warm and comfortable and well serviced with an excellent shower. Location was convenient to both Paddington station and Lancaster Gate.",5,2020,01,21
103,IMPECCABLE SERVICE!,"I could not be more pleased with the service at Park Grand! I arrived on a busy Sunday afternoon after an incredibly long travel and the second I walked into the hotel, I felt cared for. The kind gentleman at the front immediately helped me with my luggage while the lovely ladies at the desk quickly started my check in. When I went up to my room, I was a bit uneasy with the size I had booked online for the amount of nights I was staying. I had so much luggage, I should have originally asked and booked the largest club room. I received a call within the first 5-10 min of being in the room just to check to see how I was doing and I expressed my concern on the room I had booked. The lady I spoke with immediately gave me other options of what I could do. I then went down to the reception where they allowed me to see multiple rooms to upgrade too. I had a hard time choosing and instead of getting frustrated, they stayed extremely patient and continued to show me options of available rooms until I found the one that best suite me for my long stay and excessive baggage. I am more than grateful and highly appreciative of everyone that helped me during the process of finding the right room. The room I chose is perfect for my stay! It is very clean, located in a great space and is very luxurious. I am so happy to be staying here, with such great people around me, during my solo trip to London. Cheers!",5,2020,01,19
103,Very accommodating ,"We had originally booked with Grande Royale London Hyde park , but they were not satisfied with the room size we had been designated. They transferred us to their sister hotel by chauffered taxi and threw in breakfast too. A very kind and generous gesture. The new room was beautiful (albeit down some pretty narrow stairs - a bit tricky with a suitcase) but a lovely stay and helped by a lot of lovely people. Thank you :) ",5,2020,01,19
103,G,"Great hotel for the price, just a few blocks down from Paddinton station. Clean, and everything you could need in the room. Reception well staffed and everyone alway friendly. Breakfast was good with lots of choices.",5,2020,01,19
103,Great holiday,I stayed here many times and I always had an amazing time. The hotel quality is very good and the staff very friendly and helpful. They upgraded my accommodation complimentary and gave me a beautiful room. This place really makes you feel welcomed. Every time I come to London I will definitely choose this hotel.,5,2020,01,18
103,DISGUSTING,I am shocked this hotel is even legally open. The room they gave me had the TV on the floor with wires hanging off the wall. Also on the floor was about three towels and a bucket for a leak in the ceiling. The next room I was switched to had stains on the blanket and mold in the bathroom. I cannot believe I paid for this experience. I strongly urge anyone not to stay here! Wish I could get my money back and save others from this!,1,2020,01,17
103,"A Haven of Comfort, Service, Care and Attention to Detail. Five star 🌟","I have been staying at this hotel for almost a decade. I know then friendly faces, and I have benefited from the high standards of customer care. Having stayed in the best hotels in the world, I can vouch that this London treasure is five star accommodation without the price tag. It is conveniently located near Paddington so you get to the location and to your room from Heathrow in under half an hour! A buzzing lively area while safe and accessible, I have feel at home even in the middle of the London hustle and bustle. This hotel is not be missed, I consider myself a bit of a diva but all my needs are met in the high calibre premium hotel. Thank you for looking after me. Back soon! And a special thanks to Pamela and the amazing receptionists who were at my beck and call! ❤️",5,2020,01,17

103,Safe and Comfortable with Easy Train/Tube Access,"We felt safe and comfortable at this hotel, which is outside of the immediate Paddington train/Tube area.  For most of our Tube rides to tourist attractions, we took the Lancaster Gate stop to go east for an easy 20 minutes.  Our room had a comfortable king bed with a desk and bathroom.  We were cramped (esp. the bathroom) European style but otherwise comfortable.  Breakfast in the basement restaurant was great, but it was tough to get a second cup of coffee each of the four mornings that we were there - one morning it was so bad that I followed another woman to the coffee station with my cup and saucer to get a refill.  Maybe a machine would be better?  I'm not sure, but the coffee was amazing.

Just an FYI if you decide to stay here:  on our last night, it was pouring so we ventured down the street to the Taormina restaurant and were rewarded for our efforts with a delicious dinner.  It looked like a lot of locals frequent the establishment, and the waiters were witty and efficient.",4,2020,01,12

103,Mouse ruined what would have been a pleasant stay.,"stayed here Jan 2020 on a business trip, in the morning as I was getting ready I caught movement to my left, thought I was seeing things as first but within 10 seconds a MASSIVE BLACK MOUSE came running out from under the bed! 

Quickly my things and headed to reception to report it.

To be fair to the hotel they did apologise, did allow myself and my colleague to use thier town car to the airport as a way of apology.

But I cant see past the fact that I slept in a bed where there were rodents crawling  in/around or on! 

To clarify, had it not been for the mouse in would have rated my stay 4 stars. Rooms small (but clearly advertised as compact), powerful shower, bed also small but comfortable, great location and good prices. 

Hopefully I've experienced an isolated incident and any problems are taken care off by the Hotel.",2,2020,01,09
103,Family trip for NYE,"So after an awful day with several AirBnB’s (scammed & then a dirty/sketchy council estate) we needed to book a last minute hotel (on the night before NYE in central London). There was 7 of us adults (3 from the USA) and 1 child. We arrived at the Park Grand & were welcomed by Crystal who honestly felt like a fairy godmother. I spilled the dramas of the day & she made us forget the prior events which allowed us to get back into the exciting feeling of New Years. She checked us in, then offered us tea & coffee in the bar area with mince pies which gave us a chance to catch our breath and plan the rest of the evening. The rooms were a little small but not surprising for London however they were clean which by this point all we wanted was a clean & safe place to stay. Crystal had also arranged breakfast for us the following day then later on in the evening we wanted to come back and play some cards together & the staff brought chairs into a side room so that we could have the space to hang out with our family members from abroad. Overall the staff as a whole couldn’t do enough for us & I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Not to mention the location is almost perfectly central, not emerged in the hustle and bustle but only a short journey away.  Thanks for turning our New Years around! ",4,2020,01,09
103,Wonderful,"Excellent staff, rooms spotlessly clean and wonderful breakfast. Stayed here only one night with work. Was easy to find and the staff couldn’t have been more helpful. A big variety of food available for breakfast too. Would definitely recommend.",5,2020,01,09
103,Business in london,My first time in this hotel.....the room was very clean. And comfortable...the position near to all the attractions and near to all the stations tube and bus..porters was very lovely and reception team was the best I will come back next time,5,2020,01,06
103,Cheap rooms - average stay,"We stayed here as a couple on the weekend before Christmas. When we arrived at 12:00 our room was not ready and was told to come back at 14:00 - this was not an issue and they offered to store our bags if we wanted to go out.... We decided to go for a stroll to Kensington Palace through Hyde Park which is only 5mins away. 

We arrived back at 14:00 but our room was still not ready! We were asked to wait in the bar area, which was more of a foyer that happened to serve drinks, after 30 minutes a member of staff came and found us and told us the room was now ready, they directed us to our room and we went on our way.... Another member of staff then came running after us to inform us that we had been sent in the wrong direction and our room was in fact at the other end of the hotel... Not something I would mark them down for as mistakes happen but it did add the disorganised feeling we had at check-in.

On our walk to our room we came across, a leaking ceiling, wonky floors and a general feeling that the place need a good refurb... The room itself was adequate if not very small, however based on previous reviews and the fact that we were in central London we did expect this.

If it wasn’t for the fact that the room was one of the cheapest going for the dates that we were staying I would have rated this lower - however if you just need a bed for the night this could be a good option for you",3,2020,01,06
103,Start of 2020,"Great stay had a great time. Amazing start to the new year at this hotel.The staff is so friendly special thanks to crystal and Chris 
They are a good team.Friendly ,also very welcoming and very comfortable,the hotel is so well decorated and classy.
Kudos guys will come back.",5,2020,01,05
103,"Excellent service, tiny rooms","The location of this hotel is perfect!Just a 5 minute walk from paddington and Lancaster gate stations. Excellent service and staff and management were always pleasant and happy to assist. We booked this hotel as we needed a separate room for our 3 kids and 2 rooms elsewhere was very much more expensive over the festive period. 
However, the rooms are tiny, unless you book a club room. Tiny meaning you can barely open one shared suitcase.
Positives: excellent shower and underfloor heating in the bathroom 
Clean comfortable rooms and bed
Excellent location 
Warm, friendly staff
Negatives: rooms are just way too small - and I think it is solely for this reason that I wouldn’t want to return.",4,2020,01,05

103,Indian Afternoon Tea was delicious! Fantastic experience!,"Indian Afternoon Tea was a lovey experience. Really great Service by Alisa, very attentive and informative. Food was delicious and hot, the masala chai was also perfect and re-filled on demand! Would highly recommend overall!",5,2020,01,05
103,A really great stay!!,"Booked this hotel for my husband's birthday on New Year's day. Location of the hotel was easy to find, we managed to find parking right near the hotel and were lucky because it was a bank holiday so there was no charge. Lancaster Gate station is about a 5min walk away and bus journey to Marble Arch station/Park lane is approx 15mins. Great location to get around. 

Check in went well, however my details had been mixed up with another persons, but was resolved pretty quickly. 

Initially we were given a club room in the basement of the building across from the hotel. It was a very compact room but in a very good condition, however I felt quite claustrophobic so had to ring the reception to ask for a room change, initally the lady who had checked us in told us the hotel was fully book but after chasing up on my call I spoke to a gentleman calles Dario wnd he told us he has a room ready for us in the main building.

Can I just say wow, how impressed we were by Dario's customer service, not only did he change our room, but upgraded us too. Our room had 2 double beds, microwave, fridge, heating flooring in bathroom and plenty of goodies! The staff were all lovely and courteous and even bought up the food we have ordered from outside to our room. 

Breakfast was included in our stay and was good, you have a selection of hot and cold food to choose from and the waiters will even get you a specialty drink like a latte if you ask. 

We had a really pleasant stay here and a great time celebrating the husband's birthday. I would love to come back here again!",5,2020,01,04

103,"Tiny rooms, lots of noise, more like a 3 Start Hotel","Unfortunately, I can’t understand the reviews from the other people here. The room was really small, we couldnt even find place to store all our baggage. Going into the bed was only possible from one side. The double bed was very small as well. (120cm) Bathroom was ok, but very low water pressure. You can basically hear everything through that Hotel, even sometimes conversations from the other rooms. The last day we opened the curtains and saw how dirty and mouldy the window is. Really not pretty. The staff was nice, but over all with that rooms and standard the hotel doesnt deserve 4 Stars. ",2,2020,01,03
103,Hotel with Tight Spaces,"My wife and I stayed two nights at the Park Grand Paddington Court London in July, 2019, after traveling by train from Yorkshire where we visited friends. We made our reservation on the hotel website after reading the reviews and considering the pros and cons. The reservation was for a ""Deluxe Double with free English Breakfast"" for two adults. However, after our stay, we have to say that we were not thrilled with the accommodation.

Location - After arriving by train at King's Cross St. Pancras we took the tube to Paddington Station, which we read was a convenient or reasonable walking distance from the hotel. We found that it was an uncomfortable distance if you are wheeling your luggage along the streets especially because we had to negotiate a long stretch of cobble stone paving after exiting from Paddington Station. We were quite tired when we got to the hotel even though we only had one suitcase each. Another supposed benefit of being near Paddington Station is that the Heathrow Express can take you quickly from that station to Heathrow Airport. The one way fare for the Express at the time of our visit was GBP22 per person. We decided to take Uber instead. We paid GBP36.62 for the Uber ride to the airport and although it took about 50% more time to get to the airport, it was a convenient and comfortable trip, and we did not have to wheel our luggage through the streets to the train station. 

Check In - Upon arrival at reception and showing our reservation documents we were told to wait while the receptionist looked for a room. The process was not exactly smooth and rather unexpected as I was told that there was a room which was an ""upgrade"" from what we booked but was located in the basement. I indicated that I did not want a room without a window and that I would prefer the room that I booked. The receptionist made a phone call and after some waiting, told us there was a room but in the property directly across the street from the hotel. So we carted our luggage across the street accompanied by a hotel staff.

Room facilities - We entered the property across the street through a locked main entrance door which we opened with our hotel room key card. There was a hallway with a stair and a lift or elevator. There was no concierge. Because of the way the floor levels were arranged, we had to carry our luggage down a flight of stairs to our room entrance after exiting the lift. The room was remarkable because there was just enough circulation space for a person to get around the double bed after we placed our luggage against the wall where there was one window. There was a wall mounted flat panel TV and a small desk in the corner of that same wall. The hallway from the room entrance was fitted with a wardrobe, and amenities such as a small fridge, microwave and equipment for tea or coffee preparation. However, I found that the hallway was not provided with lighting and the closet with drawers and a safe were so dimly lit in the evening that they were unusable without a flashlight. The drawers were not well fitted and did not work well. The bathroom was the size of a stamp and the door to it can only be opened to 45 degrees against the bed, allowing you to slide in sideways. The shower stall felt small even for someone with Asian physique. However, I have to give the interior designer credit for fitting all the facilities into such a small space. The bed was comfortable but the shower stall drain required maintenance work because there was ponding when I showered. On a positive note, the room facilities were clean and looked well kept. A smart phone-like device was provided by the hotel in the room for guests to find their way around London. We did not use it because I found it rather bulky and we had our own SIM card for the U.K.

Breakfast - Breakfast was served in the basement dining area in the hotel proper i.e. across the street from where we stayed. The dining space was bright and tidy although the design was simple and straightforward. The staff was courteous and helpful and the food was satisfactory with a good variety. The whole breakfast experience was comfortable and satisfying.",3,2020,01,03

103,Perfect Stay,"We stayed at the Paddington  Court in early December for only one night and wished it was more.  This is a little oasis and close to Paddington Station and easy access to all sights.  From the moment we arrived the staff were cheerful, helpful and smartly dressed.  Christmas Tree/ Mulled Wine and Mince Pies for all.  Our room on the ground floor was surprisingly quiet and had recently been refurbished.   The hotel is undergoing an upgrade. Very comfy bed, perfect shower and tea/coffee snd biscuits set out on a tray with china cups and saucers.  Breakfast was a banquet served by very attentive staff.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting first class service.  We hope to return.",5,2019,12,30
103,Three happy travellers,"Three of us shared a room (twin beds and the pull-out) for four nights and it all went smoothly.  Very friendly and helpful staff, clean room (heated floors in the bathroom were a treat!), good security, and a delicious and generous breakfast.  Easy location from Paddington station.  Recommend this hotel!  Tip:  put on the robe (stored in the cupboard) - they are super soft and warm and if you feel chilled after a rainy day, it's like a big teddy bear hug.",5,2019,12,30
103,Great location in Paddington,We stayed here for two nights.  Centrally located in Paddington.  The reception and restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful.  The room was quite snug for two people but as were only in the room to sleep it didn't really matter.  There is a lovely pub just a short stroll away.  Would stay here again.,5,2019,12,29
103,Not such a good option,"The location is good - very near to 2 subway station, and close to various restaurants. The front desk staff is very kind. The hotel is clean.
Nevertheless, the rooms are extremely small (no place to put anything at all) and the beds are very uncomfortable. We had to switch rooms because the first one was absurdly small - you could not even move inside the room. 
I would not recommend it. If I come back to London, I would definitely look for a different option.",3,2019,12,29
103,weekand in london,our room was amazing...very lovely room with lot of space...the room was clean and fresh...the breakfast is lovely ...the hotel is located near paddington station and closed to winter wonderland..the staf is amazinz The staf need 10 star very helpul we will come back,5,2019,12,29

103,Good for a short break,"This hotel was great for the price! I had a short stay over here and it was what I needed. The rooms are a bit small and cramped, so be aware of that if you have more than one person staying in the room. Reception was very helpful when I needed them. Tough hotel if you have mobility issues. Otherwise you get what you pay for, which is a comfortable place to sleep.",5,2019,12,29
103,City break,"We stayed here for the weekend and the staff were very friendly and welcoming, they let us leave our luggage before we checked in so we could explore London with no hassle, breakfast was excellent with loads of selection to choose from. We will definitely be coming back to stay, thank you!",5,2019,12,29
103,Great place,"We came for a short city brake, and the hotel was perfect for this. 

Staff of the hotel was really nice and helpful - Alexandra from checking in big thumbs up! 

Breakfast was really nice - Alexa and Daniela were there to help you with anything you may need.

Location was close to two different undeground stations, easy to get arround.

Rooms were a little small but for the city brake were exactly what we needed.",5,2019,12,29

103,Birthday Treat,"I spent a couple of days in London as a birthday treat to myself. The hotel was the perfect choice. Walking distance to Paddington Station but a quiet location.The room was clean and comfortable. Included breakfast was excellent . One evening I ordered room service and had a delicious bowl of homemade vegetable soup. The big surprise was coming back to my room one evening and finding birthday treats including fresh flowers and chocolates! All of this is great but what really makes the hotel special is the staff. They are young and enthusiastic and truly want to be of service; directions, recommendations or whatever you might need. I will happily stay again next time I'm in town!",5,2019,12,27

103,Delightful!,Was in London for a busy & hectic work schedule. Stumbled upon this affordable and comfortable hotel. Room and it’s amenities were decent enough for the price I have paid. Staff were friendly and always willing to help. Perfect location for travelling in and about Central London. Good breakfast as well. Hotel decor is slightly weary but the positives more than make up for it! Will definitely use this hotel more often.,5,2019,12,26

103,Very nice staff and comfortable rooms,"We rent nice rooms close to hyde park and Lancaster subway station 
Very nice staff and comfortable room.
We had a Christmas gift from the hotel.
Very good breakfast and full of products 
Be careful on 25th December no bus and no subway",4,2019,12,26
103,Staff are the highlight of this hotel <3,"Stayed 1 night for a show in the SSE arena
Booked a double but were upgraded to a club room.
The room was on the small side, with no real view but didn't really mind for 1 night.
Husband had booked for my birthday, and on the bed were chocolates, a flower, balloons around the room etc - all complimentary off the hotel
Staff couldn't do enough for you.
Room was immaculate, extremely clean with lots of extras, drinks, biscuits, toothbrush, razors etc etc.
Location excellent. When I was looking I thought it would be too far to walk everywhere - however it wasn't. Close walkable distance - marble arch, Kensington gardens, hyde park. 3 min walk to Lancaster Gate station, 5/7 mins from Paddington. We didn't mind walking, so also walked to Oxford street, Kensington Palace, around Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, Buckingham Palace etc.
Would definitely stay again.
Thank you for you hospitality",4,2019,12,24
103,Never again ,"I will never again opt for a Double compact room the bed was definitely not a full double sized bed. The room was so small you could only get in and out of the bed on one side, no room for luggage and two people to move around. The bathroom was a joke trying to get out of the shower with no room to manoeuvre. This room should definitely be classed as a single. What an absolute joke and a rip off. The receptionist never even gave us the time of day to mention time of breakfast or wifi password or even to explain the size of the room. We had to leave early so didn’t benefit from breakfast, which again didn’t help in justifying the price I paid for this box room",1,2019,12,23
103,Extremely disappointed,"Me and my partner were very disappointed after our stay at the hotel. To start with a ‘block’ type deposit was attempted and taken from my bank twice without my knowledge before we paid for our room for the night. Once we had paid and checked in, we got to our room. The bed was a small double which was inconvenient and the room was incredibly dusty as though it wasn’t cleaned properly. There was a complimentary ‘shoe mat’ box which was empty. This further proves there was no in depth cleaning prior to our arrival. The bathroom was incredibly cramped with little room to get into the shower cubicle and the shower itself was quite weak. 
When I next stay in London I will not be staying at this hotel and I will be sure to tell my friends and family not to either.
Overall we are both very unimpressed by the service, the cleanliness of the room and the sizes of the room space and bed.",1,2019,12,22
103,Awesome!!!,This was my first stay in London and I'm really pleased with my experience! Was visiting for Winter Wonderland and am happy to state that this hotel is a gem around Hyde Park.

103,Basic but great hotel,"Not stayed in this area of London before. Selected this hotel for its distance to winter wonderland. Hotel was in a great location close to the station. Our room was a double. It was basic but had everything we needed. Comfy bed, clean and tidy. Room 302 was very nice and quite. No funny smells like other reviews state. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Would stay in this hotel again if in the area. Breakfast was included in our room rate (which I think was very cheap - we booked a super advanced price). Was a buffet style breakfast which was delicious. Check out time is midday which is another bonus. Thanks for our stay :) ",5,2019,12,18

103,Thanks but no thanks,"At first glance, I was under the impression that this hotel would be amazing. Unfortunately, the hotel under delivered on experience. Tough bedding, cold room, and blah amentities. The interior design and hotel layout was alright. The staff was pedestrian and the service was average.",3,2019,12,14
103,Disappointing room,"Booked a junior suite and on arrival we were taken to a basement room. Really disappointing, the smell was horrendous and we struggled to sleep. The room was also supposed to have fruit, wine and juice but had none. Next morning we asked to be moved and the new room was so much better. Room was a good size and had all the extras that should have been in the first room. Staff were well aware of the smell and should not be putting guests in these rooms.
On checking in, the receptionist failed to tell us about breakfast or the restaurant. We got the key to our room and told it was. across the road sent away. As it was later at night we were pretty tired and just wanted to bed so didn’t ask any questions either. Fortunately every other member of the staff was friendly and helpful. 
Breakfast was included and was a good choice of hot and cold food. Had to ask for a second cup of coffee which was a bit frustrating. 
Great location near Hyde park , Paddington station and several tube stops.",3,2019,12,13

103,UK holiday,"Hotel was within reasonable distance to tube, shops, pubs & restaurants. Room very small and unusual shape.
Even though I checked prior to booking to ensure there was a lift, which they confirmed, they did not mention that you had to negotiate about 6-8 steps to get to it. There was also a further couple sreps in corridor just before our room and again to get to breakfast room. Doesnt seem much but the was no handrail which makes it hard when you have issues using stairs and require that rail to assist. Lift was not working when we arrived and had to walk up 2 floors. At least staff helped with suitcases but still had other bags to deal with.
Breakfast very average. Glad it was part of special package. Certainly not worth what they charge.
Bathroom tiny. No where to put toiletries. Door into shower cubicle so narrow, had to squeeze in sideways.",3,2019,11,28

Room was clean and staff was very friendly.",5,2019,11,25

Everything is walking distance, there’s a great pub right down the street, lots of stores and restaurants just minutes away. Will definitely be staying here again the next time I’m in London. I had to do a room change in the middle of the stay and Paola and Dario were more than accommodating, making things so much easier and stress free",5,2019,11,24
103,Holiday time,"Stayed at this beautiful location for 4 days. If you are coming from Heathrow, it’s walking distance from Paddington Station after you arrive by Heathhrow Express. Easy access to the train and bus lines.

The room was beautiful and comfortable and you almost want to stay in bed and not go out. Shout out to Paola who was great at Check-in, Christian, Alexandra and Dario who was great when we needed a late checkout because of our 10pm flight. We will definitely be using Park Grand when we come back in February.",5,2019,11,24

103,Indian inspired afternoon tea,"Given to my wife as a birthday treat, we experienced the hotel's afternoon tea influenced by Indian food and tea.  What a wonderful experience this was.!  The food was excellent, paneer wraps, potato pakoras, panni puri-like mouthfuls potato-filled buns were our highlights, but the sweet gulabjamans, scones delicately spiced and shortbread-like biscuits were lovely.  More than enough food for the four of us and two bottles of proseco. Service was attentive and friendly and staff were very knowledgeable about the food - which was cooked fresh by the hotels in-house chefs.  Excellent value especially if you manage to get a Groupon discount!!",5,2019,11,23
103,Afternoon Tea,Excellent afternoon tea experience! I went with a group of four and had a Indian and English afternoon tea combination which was divine. The quality of the food was exceptional and the Indian afternoon tea was the best with lovely selection. The hotel itself is small but we were seated at a nice lounge. I do many afternoon teas but felt this place really top quality. We were served by Robert/ Alisa/ Aldrin who were very attentive with us and friendly. They were so kind and brought out a birthday cupcakes as we was celebrating a birthday. This place is a hidden gem but would definitely be returning. Thanking the hotel for a lovely experience.,5,2019,11,23
103,Great experience in London!,"Very quick checkin and friendly staff at the reception 
Great location and the room was clean and warm and good breakfast. Would recommend anyone who is visiting London as we will as well. Requested late check out and was accommodated which was very nice. 
So much to do around the area as well. 
A big thanks to the reception staff which was very helpful especially Iuliana.",5,2019,11,22

Great location and overall kosher hotel.",5,2019,11,21

The location also very good as close to the centre and underground station. I  recommend this hotel and definitely come back,5,2019,11,20
103,Perfect for a weekend in London,We stayed on a Saturday night for a one night stay - we had a double room which was on the ground floor - room 24.  It was cleand and tidy and had everything we needed. The bathroom was immaculate and new.  It was not the largest room but fine for a one to two night stay.  Staff were all very friendly.  Breakfast was in the restaurant downstairs and wasnt the most luxurious.  Some continental bits and a cooked buffet section.  The only downside was the lounge / bar area was very small and looked like a walk through room in the hotel - I would never go there for a drink - it seemed to be where they served afternoon tea as well - it would ruin it - as people walked through to get to their rooms!  Location was great - 2 mins from Hyde Park and a 15 min walk to Marble Arch  or the Albert Hall.,4,2019,11,18
103,Holiday in london,"I been in this hotel 4 days and i stay in room 114 the room was very very nice....on the first floor....the hotel is in a good position near the paddington and lancaster gare station....closed to hyde park....the staff is lovely and help me all the time ...vwry thanks to the manager dario for the hispitality and many thank to Paola ,alexandra ,Iuliana and spacial thank to luciano and andrei i will come back soon ...lovely",5,2019,11,17
103,Nice Hotel,"Very nice with a very, very good location. The staff was friendly. A lot of thanks to Madalina from the front desk, she helped us with everything. Definitely we will be back here. 
Thank you very much!",5,2019,11,16
103,Wonderful,"I arrived at Paddington Station early evening and after a short 5 minute walk I located the hotel. I was checked in quickly by a pleasant lady on reception. The hotel does ask for a form of ID even for UK residents so I was lucky to be carrying my drivers license with me at the time.

The concierge was also very friendly and he showed me directions to the lift to get to my room. The building was amazing and I wish I had more time to spend looking around the property and the old photos that were on display.

I had a room on the fourth floor in the corner which overlooked the street but I did not experience any problems with noise.

On entering the room I was really pleasantly surprised as usually when staying in London my rooms where usually much smaller in size when compared to staying in other UK cities.

The room was also very clean and the bathroom was super clean, perhaps it was fairly new? No sign of mold/mildew anywhere and all the fittings were of a high standard (Grohe). There were plenty of towels and toiletries and I was even more pleased with the underfloor heating and heated mirror. If I was being super picky then there is opportunity to perhaps install a hook for the hand towel and maybe increase the size of the vanity unit so we have more space to put our stuff.

Refreshment wise, there was plenty of coffee, tea and even my favourite tea (Earl Grey), biscuits, sugar, milk and water.

Unusually there was also a microwave which would come in handy for some guests. I also found an empty fridge to store things if required.

The wall mounted TV is a great size and offers basic free to air channels. What I liked was its location and not being too intrusive in the room, leaving the desk free to work on etc.

There was plenty of bedding and pillows for me to use as it was just me. Again, if I was super picky then I would say the comfort of the bed was not optimal, perhaps the springs are a bit tired, but I still slept ok as it was quiet and the bed was big.

Unfortunately I did not get to try the complimentary breakfast as I worked quite late into the night and I figured I would benefit more from the extra sleep before attending an all day business meeting.

There are mixed reviews for this hotel but based on my stay and experience on this occasion, I would definitely recommend it. It is so close to Paddington Station and also Lancaster Circus tube station on central line; this makes it so easy to get to and around Central London.

Thank you Park Grand Paddington Court for making my stay so enjoyable and ensuring I left the following day feeling 100% relaxed.",5,2019,11,15
103,Great hotel ,"Great hotel in the heart of London. The accommodations are super comfortable and the whole hotel has this very charming look and feel to it.

Hotel staff is very friendly and accessible, and my experience with front desk staff (especially
 Madalina) was awesone. The remaining staff, is also friendly and helpful, always ready to answer questions.

The English breakfast is delicious and offers lots of options. Laundry service is also offered, and is same-day service. Overall the whole experience was great and I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Hope to come back soon!",5,2019,11,15
103,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed in a compact double which had been decorated with rose petals and a cupcake for my birthday. He had a slight issue with the room the first night we stayed. We were offered a new room straight away. We had plans for the day so all our things were moved while we were out and we came back to a new room with all our thing waiting for us.

The hotel was lovely. It's in a great location. So many lovely restaurants around. A really short walk to Paddington. Honestly, we would stay here whenever we come to London. Every member of staff was so friendly, welcoming and helpful. Definitely recommend.",5,2019,11,10
103,Good stay,"Enjoyed our stay even though the rooms are very small. But very clean, comfortable bed and really nice bathroom with fluffy towels.
The breakfast was good, didn’t miss anything. But a good thing for the environment would be to skip the plastics and serve yougurt, butter and marmelades from bowels instead.

103,Great hotel in a great location!,"We recently stayed 5 nights in this hotel and were really pleased with our stay. We were 3 staying in a room, and had a really big, nice room (junior suite). Room had lovely views of a green area. Only thing I would say to the hotel to change is the sofa bed where my daughter slept, as it was very uncomfortable. Best of hotel was the reception staff, absolutely welcoming, friendly and helpful. Special thanks I want to give to receptionist Laura Patricia. We definitely would love staying in this hotel again!",4,2019,11,04

103,Excellent Service ,"We actually booked a room at the Grand Royale London Hyde Park. When we arrived at the hotel we were told there was a problem with our room. 
The staff arranged a taxi to take us to their sister hotel Park Grand Paddington Court where they upgraded our room, included breakfast and a complimentary taxi to our concert. Above and beyond anything we would expect.
The manager of the Grand Royal  then followed up with an email to apologise for any Inconvenience and offered to look after us on our next stay.",5,2019,10,30

103,"Good value with breakfast, friendly staff , room average","Good value with breakfast, friendly staff, odd layout and furnishings of room.  Good location as near to Paddington station,  good restaurants, pubs. Friendly staff and breakfast included. Room in need of refurbishment. The sash window did not open.",3,2019,10,26
103,pleasant stay,"After a trup to other parts of the UK, I stayed here on my way out of London, due to its proximity to Paddington Station, where I could walk to the Heathrow Express.  This is a lovely hotel with great staff at reception, the porters and in the dining room..  Special thanks to Lucian (aka ""Luciano Pavarotti"") who always had a smile and engaging chatter. My single room, although small, was very clean and well-equipped with a fridge, safe and tea/coffee making supplies. Bathroom was spotless with good water pressure in the shower.  Breakfast in the bright, clean dining area on the lower level was included with my stay and was very good.",5,2019,10,24

103,Quality Accommodation,"We stayed at the Park Grand Paddington Court las week and the reception we received and quality of service was excellent.
Rooms are smaller in London as space is at a premium but sufficient I felt although the en-suite was a little compact and bejeaux.
Room was very clean and TV and facilities were excellent. In club rooms you had mini fridge with complimentary wine, water, fruit and biscuits.
Clean towels every day and daily housekeeping.
Breakfast was great with cereals, cold meats, hot buffet etc.
Porters were always friendly and we will certainly visit again.
Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2019,10,22
103,TERRIBLE Experiences,"Room is small. The room hygiene was very bad, dust everywhere. Staff are rude.

I have stayed here for three nights. I have made the reservation through hotel's website, and all payments had been made before check-in. Therefore, I have no choice, I need to stay here for three nights. GBP 150 per night. It is not worth it! Actually, many other choices in the same location.

They have arranged a room in basement for me, and I requested to make a change. However, the staff are rude and not willing to help. After some effort, a manger finally arranged another room fo me - A room on 2nd floor, but also dusty and small.

It was really a TERRIBLE experience!

酒店職員似乎歧視亞洲人，相信你也不會期望旅行時入住地下室，但他們以種種原因拒絕換房，而且表現不耐煩。以每晚150英鎊 (三晚共450英鎊) 的收費，事實上在附近有很多其他選擇。肯定沒有下次！",1,2019,10,19
103,Small cramped room very average service,"Once we checked in with the rather rude receptionist, we were taken over the road to the annex.
Descending into the musty smelly basement we were shown a room slightly smaller than the average mini.
We spoke to a different member of staff and were moved to the main hotel building. Here the room was still small, but bigger and not smelly like the first offering.
The windows rattle as buses go past during the night, we resorted to filling the gap with material so the rattle would stop. The bed was queen sized, so not ideal.
I had to clean the shower head of limescale so i could get more than a trickle of water from the shower.

Location ideal for Paddington and visiting sights in London.

Overall service was abrupt and uninterested rooms too small, wont stay agian",2,2019,10,18
103,"perfect location, EXCELLENT service","The location is perfect for me, great neighborhood and everything is nearby.
A short walk to all amenities or a short drive to all the historical and shopping sites. 
small rooms but very clean and well equipped, the breakfast was GREAT and very well worth the upgrade.
I'm sure that all the staff are very helpful and polite, but Luciano and Adson went the extra mile and provided an excellent very friendly service.
I would go back on my next visit for sure , and i highly recommend this nice hotel. 
Thank you Luciano ;)",4,2019,10,13
103,Good Hotel Good location,"Not a budget hotel and not posh but nicely done.Helpful staff at all hours, even if you have a predawn flight. Very good breakfast buffet. With in walking distance of Paddington station. If you have suitcases you may want a cab (depends on age lol).  Nice lunch  selection to be had in the small bar.Also a dinner can be ordered there. Spent 4 nights there.",4,2019,10,12
103,Hussain holiday,"I am in the hotel with my son for a short vaca

103,Two NIght Stay,"We stayed two nights in September.  The location was great close to the main terminal express to Heathrow Airport. The hotel was lovely and the breakfast great. But the room we had a double bed and was so small two people couldn't even get around the bed. It was an updated room but TOO small for two people and 3 pieces of luggage. I would definately stay here again but make sure the room was bigger. We couldn't get around the room or we hardly had any place to put things we had.
",4,2019,10,11
103,Best hotel !,"This is a lovely hotel with a great relaxed atmosphere but what makes it very special is the exceptional staff always happy to provide anything you want ! From the time I entered this hotel , I was treated with warmth and made to feel at home . I stayed at the hotel for three days and on my birthday they made me such a nice surprise bringing me a cake and balloons with great message happy birthday! The best surprise I had ! I want to say a sincere thanks for everything to all staff specially to miss Madalina !

103,Excellent Afternoon Tea....,"Had an afternoon tea party for my daughter's 18th birthday.  The food was excellent and so was sevices.   All the restaurant staff were very helpful.  Nothing was a probleIm for them and provided service with a smile.  We had had both Indian as well as Traditional afternoon tea.  Must say, food was excellent at reasonable price.  I have already recommended this place to few of my friends.  Only one suggestion, for Indian afternoon tea, there were 2 desserts but they were served one each between 2 people, if someone wanted to try both then it was bit awkward.  Apart from that no real issues as such.  Would definately book them again.",5,2019,09,30
103,Good option in London,"There is not much more you could ask for at a place with a decent price range in London (meaning not paying GBP 200.- upwards/night). The staff is friendly and professional, the room clean, the breakfast enjoable. The only downside in my experience there: I ordered a taxi at reception and neither did the receptionist know the approximate price to Paddington Station nor was I informed about the GBP 10.- min. charge (apparently that is because they book it through an app).",4,2019,09,29
103,Thank you to the reception girl,"Thank you for everything guys. My stay was perfect because of you. 
My room was nice and clean. Also the location of the hotel it's very, very good. Very close to Lancaster Gate Station.
Thank you to Madalina and Andrei.",5,2019,09,28

103,"Friendly, Amazing place to stay!  Great Food and Environment!",Marius & Lucian were amazing!  They were always helping us in our room explaining how to work everything.  Always friendly and guiding us in the right direction.  I totally recommend this hotel!!!  I was on a sister trip with 3 of my sisters and we would stay at this hotel again.  The little bar was fun to end our days with a very nice glass of wine.  The breakfast in the morning was incredible.  Included everything you could ever image for a meal.  Very relaxing stay!,5,2019,09,27
103,Worst Service and Bad Rooms!,"I am not sure how this hotel has good reviews. It is certainly deceiving.  After experiencing an issue with reservations unable to find the correct reservation, the reception advises that this is not her problem. Jowell from reservations advises that even though he has received the voucher, its not on the system and we must contact the tour operator and raises his tone while explaining this. Rooms are small and have a foul smell. A refund was requested. Not worth it to stay here.......... 
Disgusted buy their service....",1,2019,09,26
103,In UK for wedding.,Wonderful experience.  Staff answered all needs.  Great location.  Already sent another couple for 10 days to Park Grand Paddington and they love it. Full English breakfast was included with our room.  2 blocks from Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park.,5,2019,09,24

she has strongly recommended me to stay here during my visit to London.",4,2019,09,19
103,Hotel staff was WONDERFUL!,"Our stay at this quaint boutique hotel was extremely personal and an atmosphere of ""home away from home"" was certainly felt. Hotel staff, Marius, Lucian, and Steve, extended an extra special measure of hospitality during our seven-night stay. They were extremely helpful in giving directions, restaurant recommendations and always greeted us in the morning as well as at the end of the day with great interest in our tourist adventures. Hotel location was a plus being only a short walk to Paddington Station, Hyde Park and many delightful restaurants. I celebrated my birthday during our stay and returned to my room that evening to a birthday cake (created with bath towels) decorated with fresh flowers, a bowl of fruit and a bottle of wine. I highly recommed this hotel. Thank you Marius, Lucian and Steve for a very memorable stay!",5,2019,09,17
103,Awesome service!!,"I spent a week at this hotel with 3 sisters. The location is great, the rooms are typical for London and are small but very clean and adequate for our stay.  The best thing about this hotel is the service.  Lucian, Marius, and Steve went above and beyond to give us directions and help us with whatever we needed.  They were such fun and we got to know them with staying a week. I recommend this hotel.  It was so nice when we returned after a day out to be greeted by those staff who inquired about our day. It felt like coming home!  The desk staff was also very accommodating,",5,2019,09,17
103,Lovely afternoon tea.,"Visited a few years ago for afternoon tea and was delighted standards of service had been maintained. Ate outside in small intimate garden area and opted for Indian themed afternoon tea.
It was lovely, bottle of bubbly came with tea and another was reasonably priced. It was a lovely way to pass an afternoon.",4,2019,09,16
103,Great friendly hotel in a superb spot,"Our room was late, so we were upgraded to a 'triple club room', which was awesome. Loads of room, very clean, great big bath. 
We really enjoyed London by staying here, an easy walk to Hyde Park and Paddington. Lots of cafes nearby for food if not eating in. 
Definitely would stay again, the cocktails were awesome and the staff attentive and friendly, that in London makes a difference.
A busy hotel and the layout could be improved with breakfast in the basement. On the whole a very good experience and enjoyable. Thank you!",5,2019,09,16
103,Another warm welcome at Paddington Court,"Stayed here same time last year for an event in Hyde Park. It was nice to be personally welcomed back at the checking in desk and again by a hand written note in the room along with complimentary wine, lemonade,bottled water and a bowl of fresh fruit! 
Room was very clean with a large comfortable bed and no noise despite being in the heart of London. The shower was excellent, with good water pressure and plenty of hot water ( unlike some other older  central London hotels I have stayed in with antiquated plumbing systems). One or 2 of the fittings in the room were becoming a little shabby but this was far outweighed by the other points mentioned. 
Breakfast was also of a good standard. It's amazing how many hotels fail to produce a quality ""English Breakfast"" but not here. All hot food was regularly replenished and appeared freshly cooked rather than sitting under heated lamps for long periods of time.
Overall Paddington Court appears to be trying hard to get it right and their customer service is excellent. Especially in the reception / concierge area. We will be back!",5,2019,09,15
103,Not that great ,"There are many hotels in London ! And I wouldn’t chose this one again.  Very small rooms and beds and no great feel to the hotel. It’s functional, but uninspiring! And there are better hotels around at better value.",2,2019,09,14
103,Lovely Central London hotel,"We stayed 4 nights at this lovely hotel.   The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.   Rooms were clean, bed comfortable, and the fresh fruit and bottle of wine were a treat.    The breakfast had a nice variety of food.   We had a light dinner our last night which was also good.   Walking distance to restaurants, Hyde park and Paddington station.    ",5,2019,09,14
103,Such a pleasant stay for a London hotel,"Elegantly styled hotel accompanied by a unique and elegant staff. Room dinner is fabulous; calamari is highly recommended. Worth mentioning,  Madalina did a great job on finding my booking which I made on the same morning. multumesc mult frumoaso",5,2019,09,10
103,Nice stay/nice hotel,"I’ve been there with my daughter for few days and we was happy with all the services.
We had breakfast and this was very taste.
Also, the reception team was very friendly, especially Madalina and Chris. they explained to us everything.",5,2019,09,10
103,Amazing! Five stars all the way!,"The visit didn’t start out as planned - bc when we got to our room, the bed was only a full. And for my husband and me, it was too small. I quickly called reception and Christian relocated us across the hall, and only made us pay a discounted upgrade fee. I loved the room so much that we stayed another two nights in there. Then, when we came back a few days later - he had wine and fruit waiting for us. Andrei was amazing in helping us get our bags back and forth as well. Both guys are rockstars at this property. Christian should be running the place because he knows what’s up. We will be back!!!",5,2019,09,09
103,Dismal & depressing - stay away!,"I always regret a “deal” in London, it was too good to be true, a 4 star hotel in central London at a reasonable price.  I always forget how a 4 star here is a 2-3 star in most other countries... this hotel is no exception unfortunately and is a dismal excuse for a hotel, shabby with no lifts, you have to walk up and down multiple flights of stairs to get to the room - a sordid little affair but thankfully, am only here for one night!",1,2019,09,09
103,Nice hotel,The hotel was nice and the staff as well. Madalina from the front desk helped me with my room and she explained me everything. My room was super. 111 it s a really club room. I am really happy with everything.,5,2019,09,09
103,Great visit!,A wonderful stay and location - central to where we wanted to go.  Big thanks to Christian for being so accommodating to our changes and the staff’s hospitality!  The room was great and facilities were wonderful!!,5,2019,09,09
103,Second time around,Second visit to the Paddington Court for the Indian Afternoon Tea and it was another enjoyable experience. Tea is served in the bar (which doesn't have a lot of atmosphere) but Steve once again did a superb job of looking after us. The food quality and quantity is amazing. I love the Marsala Chai tea. After a lovely couple of hours and a bottle of prosecco we left completely full and headed off to the theatre.,5,2019,09,08
103,Good location,"The Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel was so nice!!!
The people from there are so friendly. I had a club room on ground floor and was perfect for my stay.
I will be back again in London soon and I will stay there again.",5,2019,09,08
103,Nice mini holiday,"I had originally booked a room for two days, but I extended the stay because I was very pleased with the hotel as well as my friend.
 We had a double room, but from what I understood the reception staff gave us a much bigger room which made us even happier.

 The breakfast was delicious.  The only problem with breakfast was that for 4 days it was the same food.

 The staff at the front desk is very attentive to every detail and is very friendly.  Mădălina made sure that our stay was as comfortable and beautiful as possible.

 We have a new reservation for the month October",5,2019,09,08
103,"Be Very, Very Careful","We checked in to what was billed as a “deluxe double” room here, in what was an old Victorian home that had been repurposed as a hotel. The “deluxe” room must once have been a linen or china closet, as it was—at most—an 8’x10’ room with a bed that was not even double bed sized.  When we called management and told them it was not acceptable, we were told the rate was non-refundable and that they had nothing else for us. When we insisted on a refund, they said they’d find a room for us at a “sister property”. They then shipped us off to the Grand Royale London Hyde Park—yet another Victorian mansion carved into a hotel. The room they had for us there was in the basement, in a rabbit warren of 24” wide hallways with a dozen or more tiny rooms. The bathroom sink was perhaps 8” square, and a toilet so crammed in by that sink that sitting took a contortionists skills. The room was, in fact, a foot or so bigger and had a double bed; plus they comped the cab ride to the new hotel. Bottom line, these seemed to be family run, in run-down buildings catering to budget crowds. If you’re looking for a youth hostel experience, or are traveling out of a backpack or small duffel, this could be your cup of tea. But if you understand the meaning of the word “deluxe”, if you need to be able to turn around without bumping in to each other, or have actually experienced a queen or king sized bed....I’d pass on either one of these. Oh the included breakfast was about average, and plentiful.",2,2019,09,08
103,Nice place to stay,"I stayed here this week.  Hotel very nice, the room was clean and serviced daily.  It was great that there was a fridge in the room and you could put your drinks it there as it was really warm.  Great choice of breakfast.  Only issue I had was that each morning they served tea, but rather that giving you a pot to yourself, they poured some in your cup. On 2 occasions I had to request another cup as it was too well stewed and cold.  Might be something for the management to think about.",4,2019,09,07
103,Great hotel and responsive staff,I stayed at this hotel during my trip in London. It is located in a perfect location with easy access to Lancaster Gate (Central line) and Paddington stations. The hotel is very clean and hotel staff are impressively responsive to customer queries.,5,2019,09,07
103,Small but very nice,"This hotel is a quick walk from Paddington Station.  Check in was easy and our room was located across the street in the other building.  4th floor, it had a King bed and a pull out twin.  It was a very small room with a small but modern bathroom and shower.  There is breakfast buffet daily in the main hotel which served typical English breakfast items in addition to fruit, cereal, yogurt, breads/croissants.  It was delicious.  Being that it was so hot last week we realized that to keep the room cool we needed to keep the key in the wall switch so that the A/C could be left on.  The windows opened up for fresh air.  There was a fruit basket and tea/biscuits in the room.  The towels were nice and there was a robe and slippers too.  We stayed 3 nights, used cabs, uber, and tube (Paddington) and walked to many locations.  There is a great pub down the block called the Mitre Pub, and several Italian Restaurants along the street with outdoor seating that were quite nice.  Checkout was easy.  Would stay here again.",5,2019,09,06
103,A bit small,"The place itself was pretty clean and nice, albeit small. The issue I had was it’s smallness and lack of what I’ve seen as basic amenities. I spent about $1200 on the room for about a week, so about $170/night. Now I’m from NYC and I’m used to spending in that ballpark for a room if I need one. Pretty much every room I’ve been in has at least one of the following: a tub, a hair dryer, an ironing board. This place had none of that. They didn’t even have a dresser. The lighting is the least intuitive thing I’ve ever seen. You have to put your room key card in this slot, wait a few seconds and then the lights work. A way to conserve power sure. Cool. It’s a high price for forgetting to turn the lights off though when the card could just stay in my wallet like it would in any other country I’ve been in.
I did like it’s pretty central location near Hyde Park by Lancaster Gate and Paddington stations. I’m sure some of the pricier rooms were better but this was basic and it was just too expensive for what it was.",3,2019,09,04
103,Good Hotel,"Very nice hotel. We are very happy after our stay there. They upgrade our room in a club room which was very spacious and nice.
The reception team was amazing. They helped us with absolutly everything.",5,2019,09,04
103,Great hotel in a nice location,"My girlfriend and i booked this hotel last minute for my birthday celebration,  we managed to get it for £79 for a double room.
On arrival,  check in was quick and easy,  we did have to leave a £20 deposit via card.
Our room was room 418,  lifts were nice and spacious.
Our room was very modern,  plenty of pillows on our double bed  and a big wall mounted televisionand we were surprised that we recieved a complimentry bottle of red wine and 2 cans of pop,  along with a fruit basket and water,  also tea/coffee.
The showers was a ceiling shower but also had choice of normal shower head style.
The bathroom also had underfloor heating which was a nice little touch.
Staff were all friendly and helpful,  and location is a 2 minute walk from lancaster gate or 5 mins from paddington station
Would i stay here again... yes 100%.",5,2019,09,04
103,Wonderful stay and a good location,"The hotel is situated a good location in Paddington; I was able to walk to the nearby eateries, Paddington station, or to Hyde Park in the morning without feeling the need for a cab. 

Rooms are cosy and comfortable. I wasn't pleased that I got a room in the basement, so you don't get the extra sunlight in the morning, but it's not cramped. Breakfast has a decent variety to choose from and was delicious enough, though I am not sure why getting something as simple as an omelette was chargeable. 

Overall, the hotel is well maintained and the staff is courteous and helpful.  It's a great place to stay, especially if you're traveling with your spouse or family. I am planning to visit in Sep again and have chosen Park Grand for my stay again. ",4,2019,09,02
103,Short holiday,"I spend 3 days at Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel with my girlfriend and everything was perfect. Our room was very spacoius, nice and clean. The stuff from the hotel provided very good services, they helped us with all our needs. Thank you!!!",5,2019,09,02

Very nice people there. Especially thanks to reception team, they are so friendly.",5,2019,09,02
103,Nice Hotel,Nice place for a day in London. They upgraded my room to a bigger one! Madalina was very very helpful. It has a nice location in London close to Paddington station which takes you directly to Heathrow.,5,2019,08,31

103,"We loved the stay at the property, a budget Friendly good hotel","We stayed at this property for three days, it was an awesome experience, we got our rooms adjusted as per our request and given complimentary breakfast for the adjustments.
The staff is very friendly and cooperative. They guided us regarding the city and the airport cabs.
Receptionist “MADALINA” took great care of us and even offered us complimentary drinks in the hotel bar.
We loved the stay and bless you madalina ( from romania) 🥰.

Do visit",5,2019,08,27
103,Good Hotel,"Thank you very everything guys. All my stay was perfect. Special thanks to Madalina from the front desk. All the services was good.
My room was clean and nice. Also, it’s a very good location for the hotel. I really recomand it.",5,2019,08,27
103,Very NIce Hotel for very good price!,"Nice Hotel,good location,friendly staff,nice and clean rooms!
I spent just one night here. I loved my stay and will come back next time.
Very close to Paddington station.Nice area as well.
This hotel became my favourite hotel now.
Thank you!",5,2019,08,26
103,Great staff and location ,The hotel rooms are small to fit more than 2 small bags. The location is great and the staff is really really good. About 20 mins walk to Madam tussads and you get a hop on hop off easily. Christian the guy at the reception is really helpful.,4,2019,08,26
103,Best location,"Perfect stay!! The property is amazing near to the centre just 5 minutes walk to Paddington station, Hyde park, Edgware road... The room size is average but there is option to upgrade.. thanks to Mr atson and Mr Noel at the concierge for all the help",5,2019,08,25
103,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location, uncomfortable bed","We spend 4 nights in this hotel, combining business and leisure. The hotel is very beautiful, from the inside and outside. 

Hotel staff is multi-lingual, it was very pleasant to even be able to speak my mother tongue. All employees were polite and helpful.

The breakfast was good, repetitive but good.

The only thing I have to say is the quality of the bedding. First of all it was a tiny bed, too small for two people. In addition to that, it was way too soft, I woke up several times because I was close to fall from it.

If I travel alone, I will certainly stay again in this hotel, but as a couple maybe not.",4,2019,08,25
103,"Excellent location, great English breakfast ",We chose this hotel because it was close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations. We took the Heathrow express to Paddington and walked to the hotel in six or seven minutes. Easy access to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace for touring. The breakfast offered many choices and was a good way to start our full days. The room is a bit small but met our needs for two adults and one teenager. The room was clean and just what we needed. The room was in the basement and was a bit of a maze to get to. The housekeeping staff office is right outside our room which was a bit noisy early in the morning. Other than that it was a pleasant stay.,5,2019,08,23
103,I enjoyed staying there,"Nice room, clean environment, friendly staff - I don't know if the whole staff acts in the same manner, but Adonia made me feel like she really cared about my visit there.
Would definitely book again when going to London.",5,2019,08,23
103,Better than expected,"We booked a compact double, so expected something no bigger than a double bed, but was pleasantly surprised with what we got.  It wasn’t huge, but there was more room than I thought there would be for the price. The bathroom was nicely fitted out, with a large shower.  We were in room 514 which was across the road in the Devonshire building.  View from window was a brick wall in a service area, but no one was able to see into the room and allowed plenty of light in.  

Hotel is close to Paddington and Hyde Park, and plenty of facilities locally like restaurants. ",5,2019,08,22
103,Nice Holiday,"Very good location for this hotel. My room was 505 which is a nice and spatious room. The breakfast was also delicious.
Excelent customer services from the front desk. They are friendly and helpfull. Thanks",5,2019,08,21
103,Slightly disappointed,"Cons:  Although it was classified as a 4-star hotel, it really depends on which rooms you are staying.  We booked Club Rooms expecting better location of our rooms, but we were brought to a building across the main building of the hotel and down to the basement rooms. As one would expect, the smell of dampness kills the mood instantly. To be fair, the rooms are newly decorated and well stocked with amenities. But the disappointment continued when we were transferred to the main building with rooms above ground. The Club Rooms were smaller and amenities were not stocked properly. The shower in one of our rooms had very little pressure and overall the room just felt uncleaned. The building may be old, but the rooms should not be. Housekeeping could have done a better job cleaning the rooms too, and not let cups and glasses unwashed.

Pros:  - The English breakfast was delicious, and was included with room booking
          -  Staff was courteous and helpful
          -  5-7 minutes walk to two different Underground stations and bus stops",3,2019,08,19
103,Family vacation at Park Grand,Me and my family booked Park Grand for our holidays. We were welcomed by very nice an lovely staff at the reception. Especially Olga and Iuliana are very helpful. Rooms are modern and breakfast is very tasty.,5,2019,08,17
103,Treated myself with a lovely vacantion,"At the begining the place didnt look like much but after the initial issues (small room and a broken bathroom handle) which were quickly resolved by the lovely receptionist lady(forgot the name) ,the place got to my heart. Staff was lovely as it could be and always happy to help. Room was clean and tidy with a nice view on the main road.Looking forward to go back again.",5,2019,08,16
103,Great Pace to Stay in London,"I hesitate to give this review because I do not want all of you book here when I want to stay.  :). Whenever I go to London, I like to stay at one of the Park Grand hotels.  I have stayed at the sister hotel, but this was the first time at this hotel.  It is conveniently located near Paddington Station for travel to and from Heathrow as well as in London via the underground.  The people at the hotel are very friendly.  The hotel is clean and has various room configurations depending on your needs. I also recommend the breakfast.  The people who work in the breakfast room are extremely nice and friendly.",5,2019,08,13
103,Amazing service,After having to wait for a room change due to maintenance I was feeling a bit agitated but Floyd Fernandes at reception made my trip ! He was so accommodating and upgraded me to a much larger room due to the inconvenience. All smiles and excellent service from all the staff and Floyd especially. He’s an amazing worker and a great asset to the company. Thank you so much for everything you did Floyd and for going above and beyond to ensure I had an amazing stay at the hotel.,5,2019,08,12
103,Second time here!! Amazing as always!!,Decided to return here with my girlfriend for a short weekend break. Booked a deluxe double room and the room we received was not the biggest but comfortable enough for a 2 night stay. Staff were lovely and welcoming as always. Breakfast was delicious with a wide buffet selection. Highly recommended hotel !!!!,5,2019,08,12
103,Queen Cosmina ,"The room was perfect , Cosmina was very helpful from day 1. The location is convenient, is near Paddington and Lancaster gate. The hotel staff overall were very helpful and friendly. 

For sure I will come back the next time I’m in London.",5,2019,08,12
103,Great location ,This is a very convenient location close to the rail station.  Hyde park is very close and we walked to Harrods and V&A museum from here. There are good bakeries nearby and a fridge in the room . The room was small but it was clean and we spent very little time in the room so size wasnt a big issue . Plus it was half the cost of our previous London hotel . When others let their room door slam shut we definitely heard it but that's the only negative ,4,2019,08,11
103,Family vacation,"Great location really near to paddington station Lancaster gate station and near Hyde park, nice and friendly staff very helpful the receptionist and the porters, good breakfast full of delicious things",5,2019,08,08

103,Good experience ,The hotel was near Paddington station so it was very convenient to use the tube. The hotel room was small not that it made any difference as we were out sightseeing most of the time the receptionists were helpful and friendly. We enjoyed our stay,5,2019,08,07
103,More than was expected,"Booked the room around 30 mins before we got into it, and it was amazing! The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and very clean! 
The service was excellent. We demanded room service whilst we were out and when we returned it was done:) 
Needless to say the receptionists were very friendly and helpful! 

Will be returning for sure as apart from having excellent service, the location is very central.",5,2019,08,07
103,Quaint hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the Park Grand in Paddington in late July 2019 for three nights and fully enjoyed the room and staff. Although somewhat small rooms (we had to squeeze by our suitcases put up on the chair(s)) it was for the most part very comfortable...Maid services were top notch and the staff very professional. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel however just across the street on the corner, there is a great little cafe that offers full breakfast and has the greatest coffee at a much better price and the owner is a very friendly person! The tube is a 5 minute walk and there are tons of restaurants, shops a few good pubs just a block or two away.Even with the boutique type (small rooms) hotel, I would not hesitate to stay there again.",4,2019,08,07
103,Don’t think will be returning!,"This review was initially only going to have 1 star but as the hotel staff tried to make up for the check in disaster I have given it 3 stars. 

Waited for ages to check in to be told rooms not yet ready come back in half an hour. (This was after normal check in time) No coffee available (no one to serve) at pub area so went to find outside cafe. Came back later to wait ages again and then only given one room key (we booked 2 rooms, one for my husband and I and one for my 84 yr old Mum and requested them to be as close as possible.) and were told sorry other room not yet ready as guests checked out late. We decided that we would all go up to the one room and wait for the other room. When we got to the room... surprise surprise it hadn’t been made up! Not impressed... back down to reception to complain! I explained that this was very disappointing especially as this was a special trip to celebrate my 60th birthday. After another 20 minute wait then given rooms on different floors so said no that’s not what we asked for! After yet another wait were then told we had been “upgraded” (this included a complimentary breakfast) and had two rooms next to each other. So off we went only to find that there was a steep set of stairs to climb up... fortunately my Mum is very fit for her age so was able to manage the stairs!  Later we went out to eat and when we came back my Mum found “gifts” in her room and a card wishing her a happy 60th Birthday! She was well happy that someone thought she looked that young! As we were going out to the theatre later we requested a taxi which they ordered for us. However after waiting 20 mins and 2 calls to chase they didn’t arrive so we had to hail a taxi and only just got there in time! Not the hotels fault but another irritating factor! Beds were pretty comfortable but the bathrooms are very small and the space by the hand basin is tiny! Nowhere to put anything and this was a junior suite!  There was a lot of mould in the shower which put me off using it. Mum’s room had a unpleasant smell which got worse during the night which wasn’t very nice. When we checked out the next morning they arranged a complimentary taxi to take us to Marble Arch which was appreciated and saved the rating from only getting one star.",3,2019,08,06
103,Amazing,The hotel and the room were comfortable the location is in center near Paddington station and the park the staff was good helpful i really enjoyed i will recommend also the porters was wonderful and they are alway ready to help you,5,2019,08,05

103,Brilliant stay in a beautiful hotel!,"We’ve just completed a 2 night stay at this lovely hotel. I booked a single night initially for our anniversary after reading some good reviews and we were not disappointed! On our arrival the staff were really lovely and helpful particularly Adam on reception who was a delight for our entire stay. When we got to the room we were surprised to find that they had made 2 swans from towels and sprinkled flower petals over the bed and left us a lovely note. After this initial shock we were then surprised again when we were brought a bottle of champagne in ice with a single white rose, it really helped make the setting romantic and just feel extra special overall. We were so impressed by our stay that we stayed an additional night and although we’d already checked out of our club room Adam was again more than gracious ensuring we had another great nights stay and did his best to secure us another wonderful room.

103,Wonderful holiday in London,"What a lovely, cozy, clean and well located Hotel. Our room was on the small size, but it was perfect for the two of us. I found the heating floors of the bathrooms a wonderful addition, something you don’t t see often unless you pay a premium. The staff was wonderful, pleasant and very helpful. Always willing to assist no matter the time of day. They are very well knowledgeable of their surrounding such as local businesses and attractions and are willing and happy to assist you finding the fastest way to your destination. Ohhh and the neighborhood is just like a magazine picture. It is safe, clean and there a plenty of great local businesses from bakeries, convenient stores, bars, restaurants and all kinds of transportation  just a walk away to a few extra minutes. The neighborhood has a wonderful atmosphere and a sense of peace that is easy to loose yourself in it while going out for a stroll. I’m really going to miss this hotel, neighborhood, country etc. Our last day at the Park Grand Paddington was wonderful, we ended the day with a nice cup of tea. A great start of the day!!! Will definitely recommend all our friends and family to stay here and I cannot wait to come back London.",5,2019,08,02
103,Great stay,Loved the heated floors! the area is excellent and I had no problems taking the underground since there are two close by stations. Nest time I come to London I Would love to stay here again. The staff were super friendly. Keep up the good work,5,2019,08,02
103,Seven nights in London,"We just checked out of the Park Grand Paddington Court after staying seven nights.  We had a junior suite.  It was small but had everything we needed.  Very close to Paddington Station and Hyde Park, so a perfect location.
The breakfast was great as well.
We didn’t need much help as we went everywhere we needed on the tube, but I’m certain that the staff would have been most helpful.
We plan to stay here again the next time we’re in London.
Thanks for a wonderful stay.  We’re on the train to Glasgow now.",5,2019,08,01
103,B-day present,"Very nice stay with a very good service. Only stayed for one night and we were so happy with the room, service, breakfast and also with the location. The reception girl send us a bottle of champagne in the room along with a card. 

We will return to this hotel.",5,2019,08,01
103,Summer in London,London in the summer time is very busy and Park grand Paddington court has been my only choice this time because of their staffs co operation and clean rooms. It’s very close to Paddington. Many shops nearby. A simple straight 10 min walk to Hyde park. Recommend for a short break. ,5,2019,08,01
103,I had a bad experience,We stayed at this hotel for one night after our original hotel didn’t have an available room. The first room we were assigned was in the basement. Immediately when we stepped off the elevator we smelled mold and saw visable mold in our room. The floors were filthy.We asked for a new room and were assigned a room on the 4th floor. Again we found visable mold in our room. Something needs to be done before I consider staying at this facility.,1,2019,07,31
103,Great location!,"We stayed for one night while in town to go to the theatre. The hotel is in an excellent location, about equal distance between Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate, meaning it is very well connected by Tube and train. 

We booked a ‘Deluxe Double’ room and were a little disappointed with being given a room in the basement, however for one night it was ok and we did have a window at least. For any longer I probably would have asked to swap rooms. The room itself was small but well appointed. The corridors leading the to the room were well decorated but a little tired, particularly the carpet which was a bit worn in places. As others have said, the bed was a little hard and pillows had no give at all, not to our tastes but others may be fine with this. The option for international guests to use the free mobile phone provided in the room I thought was a fantastic touch; being from the U.K. we didn’t need this but I would love to see this in other international hotels!

We received great service from all staff, at check in, check out and at breakfast (which we received for free by booking direct with the hotel). Breakfast was good and restocked regularly which was good as the hotel seemed quite busy. If you don’t book breakfast, there are lots of nice looking cafes around the hotel.

Overall, we had a good night and would stay in this hotel again. ",4,2019,07,31
103,Perfect for short staying,"It was a quick but great visit, the staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. The location of the hotel is perfect 👌🏼 

It is 6 minutes walking to Paddington rail station and Hyde park. It is also very close to Lancaster Gate station as it approximately takes 10 minutes by walking.",5,2019,07,31
103,Fine hotel for the price,"We stayed here for a long visit to London.  Our room was across the street in the lower downstairs area.  There was no blind to the door that accessed the air conditioning unit outside, and that let a lot of light in. We had to sleep with our eye covers on from our air flight over.  

The air conditioner was very loud, but otherwise the room was quiet from street noise. 

Staff was helpful, and breakfast was good.  

If I stayed here again I would insist on a different room. 

Overall, good location and value.",3,2019,07,30
103,伦敦旅行,"很棒的酒店和房间，早餐非常值得订购.the lication is good ,staff is friendly and also the room is ok. the hotel is colse to hyde park labcater gate and paddingtin station. i will come back to tbe hotel when i.will return to  london.",5,2019,07,30
103,Excellent Service,"The staff provided excellent service throughout our ten-day stay.  The front desk staff members were cordial and responsive to special requests, the breakfast room staff constantly replenished food items on the buffet table and provided friendly, prompt service.  The club twin room was spacious enough for two adults and included a microwave oven, coffee/tea-making items, hairdryer and multiple types of outlets.  The complimentary mobile phone was a great perk that we could use for free calls to the U.S.A. and for Internet access to help us find our way around London.  Our room had excellent lighting plus darkening shades for a good night’s sleep.  The bedding was comfortable and robes and slippers were included.  Housekeeping was thorough throughout our entire stay.  The location was within an easy six-minute walk to two London tube stations, Paddington and Lancaster Gate, and to the Paddington railway station.  We booked directly with the hotel and felt we received a fair rate compared to other hotels in the area.  ",5,2019,07,29
103,Excellent location and very nice rooms (only lacking a bit more space at lavatory in bathrooms),"Excellent overall with only one small setback (at end of review). The staff was very helpful, in particular Adam by correcting the price to one in my reservation (had the email on paper and on my iphone). Breakfast was good and the needed fuel for heading out to the subway stations very close by. The neighborhood excellent to come back early in the evening with the family and feel safe while approaching the hotel. Also very good restaurants nearby. And the small grocery stores right around the block. The only small thing was in the bathroom, were the space for the lavatory is very very small. Common for hotels in Europe, only this was a little bit too small. But still we rate our stay with 5 five stars, and surely will come back when possible.",5,2019,07,29
103,Excellent stay and service,From the time we checked in everything was amazing. All stuff members are very nice always smiling. We had a great stay and definitely will be back. Weather was very nice so we enjoyed a lot. Location is also very good,5,2019,07,28
103,very nice,The hotel is cool near the center the tube station of Paddington and Lancaster gate station in five minutes walking  you can reach Hyde park. The staff is very helpful nice and gentle the can help you at any time. I will recommend,5,2019,07,28

103,Wonderful,This hotel is lovely and the location is very convenient its near the Hyde park and I can go to hiking in the park every morning and also the breakfast here is delicious. Its near the Paddington Station,5,2019,07,26
103,Holiday,"The hotel it's nice and the location it's also good.
Our room wasn't very spacious, but we paid for a compact double, so was fine.
The breakfast it's delicious:)
I want to mention that the staff it's very helpful and friendly, especially Madalena from the reception, she it's really nice.
I will be back in October.",5,2019,07,24
103,Not a 5 star hotel.,"The reception staff were not particularly friendly or helpful.  Some rooms are across the street from the reception area.  There was no top sheet on the bed, and the room was tiny.  The location is convenient, being within walking distance to Paddington Station.",3,2019,07,23
103,Great spot,"Staff were all super welcoming and helpful. Great location, walk to Kensington gardens, near Paddington station. Breakfast is good and Madalena in particular made sure my stay was comfortable. Will definitely stay on my next trip",5,2019,07,23
103,First time in London!,"WOW! My first time in London and the staff of this hotel (Chiara, Adam, Madelina, Juliana, Maurus) made everything so cozy and enjoyable for my stay. What an excellent hotel and a perfect location a few blocks from Paddington Station. I will stay here again. Clean, comfortable rooms - wonderful night's sleep. Thank you!!",5,2019,07,23
103,"Mediocre, did not feel like a 4-star property","Uhhh, I'm not understanding the high rating this place has at all. It's not terrible, and I don't have any massive complaints, but was expecting a four-star hotel and it definitely didn't feel like one. I did book one of the lower priced rooms, but I was disappointed it was below street level and super-small (tiny + basement level is a bit claustrophobic). It's in a retrofitted series of old buildings, so there are labyrinthine corridors to navigate to get to your room. It's fine if you need to be in this area and it fits your budget, but temper your expectations. I usually stay in The Pilgrm which is right by Paddington and affordable (also v small rooms), but it lacks AC and in midsummer I really felt I couldn't go without.",3,2019,07,22
103,"convenient location, apalling beds and pillows","I chose this hotel because of its convenient location, and because the breakfast included rate was decent. The location on Hyde Park was lovely, and Marble Arch was a comfortable 15min walk away, with the Central Line and Paddington station a 5 and 10min walk away respectively. The breakfast was ok, their pastries are notably good, but there are numerous charming coffee shops around where I could have gotten a more varied breakfast for much cheaper. 
The real challenge with this place is the bed and pillows. we booked and paid in advance for four nights, or I would actually have moved hotels. The beds and pillows are just old. Both my and my husband's backs were so sore each morning, despite us both being very fit. The bed made a decided dip in the middle, it had no bounce left in it. The pillows were hard. We complained and asked for other pillows, and were told we had duck feather pillows. It felt more like a wooden log. There was no give, you couldn't fluff them up, nothing. I woke up with a headache each morning. Also very disappointing that there was no fridge in the room. Forget about calling for ice. Even if you call 5 times, you are not going to get it. I eventually collected it myself from the bar when I was really desperate. No complimentary water. The Deluxe room we had was a generous size for London.",2,2019,07,22
103,Excellent price-quality relationship,"Nice Hotel in the quiet Paddington area. Hotel close to public transports, subway, cafeterias and restaurants.
The hotel’s staff is super kind, helpful and ready to assist Customers.
We chose a standard room. The room size was small but fine for a 4-day staying in London where, in our case, we were supposed to sightsee the city rather than spending our time in hotel. Clean room with welcome snacks & water; the bathroom was recently renewed. 
I cannot review breakfast, as we always woke up to late to have it in hotel.
Btw the hotel is close to a 24/7 shop, selling dairy products, fresh baked pastries and juices for a take-way breakfast or breakfast on the go.
A very good hotel, for those who want to stay in a nice hotel and save some money when visiting London. ",4,2019,07,21
103,Great choice,"Excellet place to stay!!! Good place to stay for business and for vacations!! In the reception Madalina was very nice and kindly person, to feel like you are in home.  All staff of the hotel were very kind.",5,2019,07,20
103,Ana aye,"Thank you for everything. All my stay was fine. Clean and nice room with very nice staff. They helped me with everything. The location of the hotel it’s good, close to the stations. Especially thanks to Madalina. Also Adam and Iuliana helped me. Thank you to Lucian",5,2019,07,20
103,Holiday,"I’ve bene there with my wife for a Short holiday.
The hotel it’a very nice and clean with a very good location. The breakfast was also good.
The reception team was very helpful for us. They spend a lot of time to make our stay comfortable.
The porters helped us with luggages and everything.",5,2019,07,19
103,Business Trip,"The stay was amazing! Adam basically saved this whole trip with his great attitude & service! All else was pleasant! Looking forward for my next stay. 
The location was actually very central & convenient.",5,2019,07,19
103,Best location ! Safety!,"Location is perfect and very Safety! 
Chiara and Luchiano are really nice. 
끼이라는 제가 방이 마음에 안들어서, 바꿔달라고 했는데도 잘 바꾸어주시고 , 루치아노는 항상 밝게 인사하며 잘 도와주세요.
패딩턴 위치 너무 좋구요. 하이든 파크에서 가까워서 너무 아름다운 동네요. 좋은 가격으로 잘 잡아서 지내고 갑니다.
아침밥. 괜찮아요. 인도음식은 안나와요 참고하세요.",5,2019,07,18
103,OK visit,"So firstly, the hallway stank of school toilets, which was quite shocking.

We were there for a concert so to come back after a night of great music to the stench, ruined the end of the night.

Mini bar was empty, which was even more shocking as we were looking forward to spending money on some brandy.

The basement room wasn’t great but then again it was during a busy period so, stay if you have no choice.",2,2019,07,18
103,5 star hotel,I stayed here just for one night the hotel is not very big but is very clean. At first my room was not so big so I asked the reception to change it and Chiara did it wthout any hesitation. I will recommend it,5,2019,07,18
103,Nice hotel,"Very happy! This hotel is very chic and clean. Our room was very spacious.
 They have a full english breakfast which is delucious.
Also, the reception team it's available 24 hours; that's amazing!
All the staff it's nice;good hospitality and brilliant customer services.
Madalene was very helpful for me; she gave me a lot of information about the hotel, city and more things.",5,2019,07,17
103,Amazing holiday,The hotel os ggod with a very strategic location the room B09 is spacious big clean and refurbished everyday woth tea and coffee. The staff at the hotel is very helpful kind and professional ready to help you with all your requests,5,2019,07,16
103,Good Location. the best point!,"Location great if travelling by train. Staff helpful and room clean. However, I have to say the room was as small as you can get for a double and the bed must be on the very limit of what passes for a double. I'm around 6'3"" and my feet stuck well out the end! Combined with a set of noisy air con units outside the room added up to a poor night sleep. Also, some of the lights would only turn off by taking the room key out and the TV wasn't tuned to any channels and I had to do a full re-tune.
To add insult, the receptionist made me pay £23 on exit as they said I had been undercharged. When I queried this later with expedia, it appears the Hotel made ""an error"" and expedia have refunded me",3,2019,07,16
103,Lovely afternoon tea,"Lovely place for afternoon tea with family and friends. Child friendly too.
Service was amazing. Our requirements were taken care of well. The Indian inspired afternoon tea is delicious.
My first visit was in spring and the place was quiet where as it can get busy in summer.",4,2019,07,16
103,Average Hotel-Good Location,"We stayed at this hotel six nights and found it to be of average quality, but in a good location convenient to the train station and the Underground.  It's divided into multiple buildings and not all rooms are easily accessible by elevator.  The decor is somewhat pretentious and seems to be a failed effort to make an average tourist class hotel look upscale.  Management might have been better served to have moderated the oversize wash basins in the very small bathrooms such as to leave a little space available to set a few items such as toothpaste and other common personal items.  Better hotels charging comparable rates and as favorably located are available nearby.",3,2019,07,16
103,Lovely rooms,"Great accommodation in a convenient part of London. 4 min walk to Paddington station, lovely walks in Hyde Park, fun restaurants. Front Desk staff were a little stressed but worked hard to accommodate our needs. ",3,2019,07,15
103,Indian Afternoon Tea.,"We have been here before, and that’s why we came back. Afternoon tea is iconic in London, but the Grand do an ‘Indian’ style one. It is delicious, both savoury and sweet. The presentation is fab and the taste is delicious. I highly recommend this. Great location, really nice staff. Fabulous afternoon, thank you all.",5,2019,07,15
103,Good Location ,"Stayed here for one night in July. We were attending British Summer Time in Hyde Park. The hotel was a great location for this.
The hotel itself is in a good location and is 10 minutes from Paddington. The room was very small for a deluxe double. The staff were friendly and helpful. We’d stay again but would need a larger room for more than 1 night.",3,2019,07,15
103,Short holiday,"Very nice and clean hotel with a good location.
We had a nice stay at Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel where everything was perfect.
For my girlfriend birthday the staff prepared a nice surprise and the room was prepared very nice. 
The girl from reception, Madaline it's very good with a nice smile
Thank you",5,2019,07,13
103,Senior Advisor,"Sorry I first reviewed the wrong hotel. I stayed in this hotel and have to say it was brilliant. Room a little dark but the superb staff certainly made up for it.

I've stayed in all sorts of hotels throughout Europe, some good some terrible. This hotel was brilliant because it was small enough to care without the staff crawling for praise.

These guys didn't need to. They were brilliant!

It's not often i single sstaff out but on this occasion I have to. Steve behind the bar, was excellent and went above and beyond. Made sure we were happy and had a good customer rapor. Well done mate. 

To the owners..you have a great bunch of staff, keep it up. 

Thanks for an enjoyable stay.",5,2019,07,11

103,"Good room, service, location and value!","Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room (a double) was clean and comfortable. We were right on the street but it was quiet day and night. Amenities were as advertised, including a free cell phone for navigating and calls. The location was better than we realized when we booked it: quiet and safe, residential but located near enough to Hyde Park and Paddington Station. We found a good deal and were very pleased all around.",5,2019,07,07
103,Indian inspired afternoon tea,"We saw an offer on groupon for the Indian inspired afternoon tea and thought we’d give it a go.   When we arrived the front desk directed us through to Alisa who showed us to our table, she was very friendly and helpful, describing all the food in detail and topping up drinks when needed.  The food was absolutely amazing, every single bit of it was so tasty and so was the bottle of Prosecco, we both really enjoyed it.  Could not fault the food or the service from Alisa at all.  We’ll definitely be back and can’t wait 😊",5,2019,07,07

103,The nicest people and lovely hotel,"I loved everything about this place. People are extremely helpful there. From the moment we checked in this hotel, the staff here tried their best to accommodate our requests.. Chiara at reception is our favorite. She helped us with all our requests. So much appreciated her patience and diligence. She definitely made our good stay at this lovely place even better. Also, Laura at the restaurant was super helpful. She made our breakfast time enjoyable: myself and my mum are allergic to certain food and she did her best to ensure our food is clean and we liked. Thanks a lot to this awesome place for super good time spent in London!",5,2019,07,01
103,Great Place to Stay at while visiting London,"Great service and really nice, clean and modern rooms.  The beds were so comfortable and all the amenities very modern and updated. Loved our stay at this hotel. The location is also perfect with only a short walk (5 min max) to the closest underground station.  Overall, would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London. We will definitively stay there again when we are back in London.",5,2019,07,01

103,Awesome couple of days,"This hotel is a 5min walk from Paddington station. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. Lovely little bar area even though my large glass of wine was £9, but it was very tasty!! The delux double room was very comfortable and bathroom with shower was awesome. Choice of shower heads to use one small and one large. Large definitely! I can’t fault anything about this hotel, I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again. ",5,2019,06,28
103,Enjoyed our stay very much!!!,We have really enjoyed our stay here at the Grand Park Paddington Court! The location is great as Paddington station is just a quick walk up the road.

And Steve in the lobby bar was interesting to talk to and very friendly! Thanks to all for making our stay in London wonderful!,5,2019,06,27
103,Work Stay,"I had two stays in this Hotel and enjoyed both of them, the food was really good, the room and facilties really good and clean. I would definately go back to stay in this Hotel and i have already recommended to a friend. ",5,2019,06,27
103,Wonderful stay,"I stayed at Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel for three nights during my latest trip to London and I really enjoyed it, being it my eighteenth time in London. Firstly, I deeply appreciated the location, just within a stone's throw of Paddington Tube Station. I also liked the general impression of the building and the rooms as well, even though my one was maybe a bit too small (perhaps partially due to that being a single room), which is the only reason why I didn't give five points. However, to make up for it, I found an Italian wall socket in my room so that I was able not to use any adapter, which left me chuffed to bits!. In addition, I would like to mention the quality of breakfast which was rich and pretty well assorted, served in a quiet room with a pleasant background music. And last but not least, every member of the staff was really kind and friendly. Although my English is pretty good, I was able to speak Italian with the receptionist, which left me pleasantly surprised. In particular, I would like to thank Adam and Madalina for being so kind.",4,2019,06,25
103,Bussiness trip,"I've been to London for three days for work.

The staff (especially Radu) have been wonderful and caring for all our needs. So kind and thoughtful our stay could not have been better. 

Thanks guys for the first class English hospitality!",5,2019,06,19
103,customer service,"Easy to find from Paddington station and Lancaster gate station. Clean environment. Friendly staff. Helpful too. Good customer service.  
Special mention to Chiara. Amazing customer relations. Recommend",5,2019,06,19
103,Ms. Ngozi Uchidiuno,"My stay in property is worth the while and fabulous. Breakfast is good and staff reception is excellent. Ms. Madalina and Adam are exceptional, highly commendable receptionist. 

The location is outstanding due to its proximity with Paddington Station. 

Thank you.",5,2019,06,19
103,"Smallest room ever, but recommended ","The hotel is situated in Paddington court area of central London. It is 200 meters from underground and train station.  Locality is peaceful & very clean. There are hundreds of restaurants in the vicinity to choose the food you want to have. Hotel's restaurant also serve routine dishes. The staff was very courteous and helpful. There were all basic amenities in the room like refrigerator,  coffe maker, safe, ac, wifi etc. Bathroom was well stocked with basic toiletries & clean towels.  The biggest negative is room size. This is the tiniest room I've ever seen in a hotel. Maximum 100 sq ft. If you open your suitcase, you can not move around. So good for solo traveller or couple with minimal luggage. Not at all for family. I recommend it due to it's location, tariff & staff.",4,2019,06,19
103,Fantastic service!,"I took my Mother and Fiance to afternoon tea and the service was fantastic!

It was a little awkward in the beginning since we had to wait in the hotel lobby until someone came to take us to our table, the lobby was quite tight and busy but this is the only negative I have to say.

The food was fantastic! It was quick service, the food did not take long to arrive then the waitresses where all fantastic! Our glasses were never empty, also without asking my Mother was treated to a 'Happy Birthday' sing song, a little birthday cake and an extra glass of fizz all without even asking!!

I can not rave about this place enough, it was truly the staff that made it.
I will certainly be recommending this place to others!

Thank you for making my Mother's Birthday SO special!",5,2019,06,18
103,Will stay again ,Our stay at the paddington court was very enjoyable all the staff was friendly and very willing to help.  On more than one occasion I had witnessed the kindness to assist guests with any and all issues.  Used the “handy” provided in the room and was more than happy to have a smart phone like device so that we did not have to use our international data plan. Adam was very helpful upon checking out and assisted us with our travel plans after leaving the hotel to find out about tube disruptions. I will be sure to suggest this hotel to other and hope that in the future i can stay here again!,4,2019,06,18

103,Made a special occasion more special,"We went to London to celebrate my parents' 50th anniversary and my dad's 80th birthday. We told all the places we stayed about that, but this hotel was the only one that did anything special.

When they arrived in their room, it was covered in balloons along with a towel made up to look like a birthday cake. It came with a free cupcake, chocolates and a lovely birthday note. It was a wonderful gesture and something that we always remember.

We sprang for a club room, which came with some free fruit and a half-bottle of wine. The room itself was still pretty small, but by London standards, it was about what was expected.

We ate at the hotel restaurant/bar the first night, which was perfect for four tired people. I had started to get a little homesick, so I ordered a cheeseburger, which was really good. The breakfast buffet in the basement was also pretty good.

The service was consistently excellent. The people at reception were helpful without fail, and the concierge helped with my parents' bags and then later helped us get a cab to the train station.

The location in Bayswater was also good, convenient to Paddington and a short walk away from the border of Hyde Park. One thing to watch, though: There are several Park Grand hotels with similar-sounding names in the neighborhood. We at first went to the wrong one. Thankfully, the correct one was down the street.

It was a good hotel, but the way they treated my parents made it great.",5,2019,06,15
103,"Wonderful service, great rooms! ","The stay at park grand Paddington was amazing. The rooms were very comfortable. The location is great, very close to Lancaster and Paddington stations. The staff and the reception was very accommodating and great to help. Overall my stay was amazing.",5,2019,06,15

103,will be coming back,"the hotel is located 5 minutes walk from Lancaster gate bus stop and tube station so was an easy access to all other parts of London. I booked the compact double room but the reception check me in a single room, when I told them it was not the room I booked, they changed it immediately to the compact double which was compact indeed but I was happy with it during my stay. The room was cleaned every day, and the staff were always nice especially Marius who carried my heavy luggage with a smile on his face. Breakfast was good. All in all, the hotel rooms are small but compared to the price, location, cleanliness, and staff friendliness, I wouldn’t mind the room size and will be coming back. This is a value for money hotel. ",4,2019,06,14
103,Awesome,We were really impressed by the service and the room was just perfect. We met two russian speaking receptions and it was very helpful for us. Olga and Criss were really helpful and very attractive to all our needs. They just could not have been better. Cheers guys!!!,5,2019,06,13

103,Onlly one night stay!!,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 night with my girlfriend, originally booked for 27 Devonshire but we were put across the road which is 3 Devonshire and also they provide for us a complimentary upgrade to a bigger room ( Thank you very much, Team). The room was very nice, quite and clean. We also had breakfast and I wanted to say it was a perfect ENGLISH BREAKFAST. The staff was very nice and welcoming every guest. The lady was assisting us to the room, and then they bring the luggage in the room. Thank you everyone for this nice stay.",5,2019,06,11
103,good value for money,This hotel was recommended to me by my colleague who has tried all the other hotels around Paddington  station and  I never regretted taking an advice. Location is great : only 20 minutes from Heathrow airport by express train and another two minutes walk from train/metro station. The hotel is clean and well maintained. The staff are friendly and attentive. English breakfast is tasty with real good coffee!,5,2019,06,11
103,Great stay,"Really liked this hotel. Excellent room service. The bed and shower were great.  Needed iron and ironing board brought to the room and after ringing reception it was down after a couple of minutes. 

My room was in the basement so didn’t have a great view.",4,2019,06,10
103,"Location, location, location ","This was our first time to London. We found this gem here on TripAdvisor. The Park Grand Paddington is perfectly located near the Paddington train station, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of its traffic noise. Our room, for three, had a good size queen bed and foldout full-size couch. Had air conditioning too, an added bonus. The room also came with a Samsung smartphone to use on our excursions (for those of us who like keep their own phones on airplane-mode to save money). We used that quite a bit for its google maps. The tube and buses easy to catch there as well. Highly recommend. ",4,2019,06,10
103,Painfull stay,"I booked the deluxe room with a city view for one night at the last minute at the discounted price. But in reality, the room was not deluxe. I was greeted and assigned the room by Olga. The room was on the 4th + floor, so you first get with the lift on 4th floor and then walk up one more flight of stairs. First, the smell in the room was overwhelming with mold and some other odors. Opening the little window did not help because there were some external AC devices, noisy and smelly. View was not a city view but roof view. I could not stay in the room and went out although I was tired after a plane trip. The AC in the room won’t work when you leave the room because of the electronic key.  The bed sheets were covered with a dust. The mattress was very hard and bumpy, and pillows were very hard. So next morning I woke up with a pain in my body and skull. The shower was ok, except a mold in the corners of the stall. The hand-held shower was not flexible because of the stiff hose. The rain shower was weak. The bathroom itself was small, the toilet bowl was very close to the shower stall so in order to get in the shower you need to go sideways. Floor  in the bathroom was clean. In total, it was disappointing stay, not a deluxe room as promised.",1,2019,06,10
103,Very nice hotel !!!!,"Very nice hotel with a great location any many options for dinner. We only stay for a few days but I wanted say a big Thank to all the staff. 
Good service , good location and very clean rooms. 

The best part is the handy phone in the room which is very helpful for all the tourists!!",5,2019,06,09
103,brilliant,"Today my partner and I had the Indian afternoon tea.
This was a Groupon deal and  has to be the best tea experience EVER
The service was superb and the two lovely waitresses could not have been more pleasant or efficient.  The feast comprised sandwiches, savouries, dips, wraps, deserts,scones with cream and jam, biscuits and cakes served with either tea or coffee and a bottle of Prosecco  Perfection in every way and I cannot wait to visit again. thank you thank you thank you",5,2019,06,09
103,Beautifully located,"Incredibly well located, helpful and courteous staff, clean and hygienic - couldn’t possible ask for more in this price range. This was my second stay here; there’ll definitely be a third. Hyde park and oxford street are a walk away. Tonnes of restaurants nearby. Its all quite lovely.",5,2019,06,09
103,Average hotel in good location,"We stayed in this hotel for one night for our anniversary. It is very close to Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate tube so an excellent base to get around London.
The room was small but adequate. We asked for more coffee on our way out in the evening but it did not materialize. There was also an unpleasant smell coming from the bathroom, which was more noticeable because the bed was right next to the bathroom door.
Overall, it was ok but no different to a Travel Lodge, in my opinion.
There was a lovely cafe nearby, which we visited for breakfast.",3,2019,06,09
103,Nice location friendly staffs,"Nice room , big room with lots of amenities. Nice service and very friendly staff especially Olga at the reception. Location is perfect very convenient. 漂亮的房间，大房间有很多设施。 服务很好，非常友好的工作人员，特别是奥尔加在接待处。 位置很完美，非常方便。",5,2019,06,09
103,Good location but very small rooms,"Location of the hotel is very good and quite close to underground station
The rooms however are quite small and I had to actually keep one suitcase in bathroom so that there was enough walking space in the room
If you are ok to compromise on space then the place is great ",3,2019,06,08
103,Afternoon tea,From the moment we arrived Alisha welcomed us and was attentive during our stay. The Indian tea was delicious and great varied selection. Our whole experience was made special by Alisha's professional service. I will definitely be returning.,5,2019,06,08
103,Comfortable cozy rooms ,The hotel locates really close to the tube stations hence it is well accessible. The staff here was really helpful especially Olga.Well equipped and clean rooms. It a perfect value for money hotel for sure .I will be back ,5,2019,06,08
103,Mr. Ali,I booked this hotel on booking.com and I am really glad. Hotel located in a very good location. Me and my friend came here for visiting our old friends. We got a room across the road which was just perfect. I would like to mention Olga at the reception who was really helpful,5,2019,06,08
103,All perfect! I recommend,"Service is 5 stars. The location is the best, hyde park is just few minutes from the hotel the accommodation has everything you need and it's all very clean. Special compliment for Olga and Madelina, they're very nice and friendly.",5,2019,06,08
103,Vacation with the family,"Warm welcome from staff. Beautiful hotel and location. Rooms are clean and super cozy. Everyone is extremely friendly and welcoming. Olga, Adam, Madaline are super lovely. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting this lovely country.",5,2019,06,08
103,Tourism,"Very clean and tidy rooms, and the staff is super friendly specially Olga and Madalina and Adam.

The location is central and close by to most attractions and there are plenty of restaurants around.

The train station is 400 meters away.",5,2019,06,08
103,"Great location, reception hit and miss","Overall a great hotel. Beautiful location just about 6mins walk from Paddington station (can take the Heathrow express so you can literally get from the airport to your hotel in about 25mins!).

The building itself is beautiful with old style looking doors and corridors but modern, clean and comfortable rooms and bathroom. Bed also nice and comfortable.

Breakfast (we got ours included) was also nice with both hot and cold (hot was all the components of a full English breakfast). Tea and coffee (including espresso) also included. They supplied light yoghurts, which was nice. Also a range of pastries and danishes. Nice setting with a large TV put on silent with subtitles.

Overall pleasant except for some reception staff who didn’t seem to care, or communicate with each other (had to tell 3 separate people we were getting mishandled baggage delivered and still when it was finally delivered they said it wasn’t - after taking an hour contacting back and forth with the airline and parcel service we find out it is delivered and the reception just didn’t communicate with each other or bother to look...this is in the context of us only having a day in London to explore).

The only disappointment to an otherwise lovely stay. Would still recommend this place.",4,2019,06,06
103,Tiny rooms,"Never seen such a small room advertised as a double. Bed small, one bed side light and bed against wall, would not even consider it a single. Got worse on going to bed a very noisy fan noise outside going on and off impossible to sleep. Went to reception and after 3/4 hour found us another room still tiny but at least quiet. Positives efficient air con and spotlessly clean. Breakfast continental good variety but cooked items mediocre. Staff helpful but avoid room 008 at all costs.",3,2019,06,05
103,Disappointed ,"We were looking forward to a 4 star stay in a luxury hotel after travelling around the UK for several weeks staying in 2 and 3 star accommodation to save the “best” till last. The hotel is in a great location with an easy 7 min walk to Paddington station which you can then get a train to anywhere but the Heathrow Express was outstandingly fast and easy. The hotel is also an easy walk to Hyde Park. We paid and got a club room so we could have a bit more space, but is still quite small. One day our room was not cleaned and had to ask for someone to bring towels etc to our room. The towels are so thin, not big fluffy towels as you would expect from a 4 star hotel. It felt like we were using a scratchy tea towels. The hotel does have a lift however only to some of the rooms, we still had to use stairs to access the room. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was the usual buffet style and you can order eggs to your preference. Overall we were comfortable but I wouldn’t class it as 4 star. We stayed in 3 stars with bigger rooms and dare I say, nicer towels. ",3,2019,06,05
103,Miss Hall,"A beautiful place to stay. Visited for my partners surprise 50th birthday. Our room was fabulous, very clean and comfortable with everything in it we needed. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one. I can highly recommend staying here and will certainly do so again",5,2019,06,04
103,Mrs,"This was my first time at the hotel. It's in a good location from where places of interest can be easily reached.  The hotel room is Clean, daily serviced. Restaurant is superb. Staff welcoming and ready to help. Most of all, WiFi is available. I had a nice stay here and would highly recommend Park Grand Paddington Court hotel.",5,2019,06,01
103,Excellent stay. Staff very friendly and helpful,"Stayed here in May with my two grown sons in a triple room. Was very clean and more than enough space. We had complimentary toiletries, fruit, wine and cans of fizz, along with the usual tea, coffee and biscuits. I double checked that they were free with reception! Requested ironing board and iron, and more tear bags and milk. Both times my request was sorted within minutes. All staff we spoke to, from reception to breakfast staff were happy, friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included with our room, but was only £11.99 anyway and for London that was a real bargain. Food was fine, more than value for money and service was excellent. Would not hesitate to stay here again and highly recommend. ",5,2019,05,31
103,Lovely hotel just a bit noisy!,"The hotel is lovely, location is spot on and all staff were really nice and helpful!

We visited for my boyfriends birthday and the room was decorated with flowers and a cake which we thought was a lovely addition! Upon check in we were told we’d been upgraded and moved across the road which I was somewhat sceptical about but there was no need!! The room was very high tech and great quality. Bed was comfy and spotless! 

Room is compact but it’s London, you shouldn’t expect copious amounts of additional space. 

My only ‘comment’ would be that the walls are thin, you can hear the TVs in the next room and noisy outside but that’s not much of a fault from the hotel. Also breakfast is quite basic, I can’t remember if I paid extra for it but if I did, I wouldn’t again - it was buffet style as opposed to cook to order. 

Overall though a lovely stay, would recommend and would stay again. ",5,2019,05,29
103,Perfect lodgings for solo traveller,"Ideally situated in a quiet street, yet only five minutes stroll from Paddington station. Helpful staff on the front desk (who organised a prompt delivery of an iron and ironing board when requested). 

A compact room, to be expected central in London, with a brand new bathroom and all expected amenities. The single bed is fine (although I'm over 6ft4 so it was a little short in length). Aircon worked well, the room was very quiet and a good place to rest.",4,2019,05,28
103,Delicious Indian tea had by all,"We had a lovely table by the window. Our waitress and waiter were attentive and communicative. The surroundings were very nice too. Then the Indian masala tea arrived - delicious.  Food and sweets were very good, we left satisfied with everything and have recommended it to our friends too.",5,2019,05,28
103,Lovely Indian Afternoon Tea,"My Mum and I did the Indian Afternoon Tea at the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel yesterday and I have to say this was among one of the best of all the Afternoon Teas we have done using Groupon Vouchers. I am pleased that we chose this one to experience our first Indian Afternoon Tea as opposed to normal ones. The service was great and we were welcomed and made to feel special during the whole sitting. I want to say a special thanks to Alisa and Elena who looked after us and accommodated us so well. You could not do enough for us I thank you for your kindness and hospitality. The food was delicious too and we especially loved the savoury selection in the Tea. Great choice for Teas and other drinks including Coffees and a nice Mocktail made specially for us as we do not drink. The atmosphere was quiet, bright and nice too and we could not have asked for anything more. We were extremely full when we left! Thank you so much again. We will definitely recommend you guys and hope to visit again in the future. Best wishes, Natasha Thumiah",5,2019,05,19
103,Brunch,Had a friends bday brunch here. The venue for the brunch is small but can not fault the service and attention from the staff. Very nice and attentive and brilliant value for money. They even brought out a small cupcake on a plate with a candle and happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate for my friend. Very lovely afternoon. ,5,2019,05,18
103,Nice,"Stayed here for an award ceremony for work. Facilities good. Rooms clean and spacious.

Nice selection of drinks and snacks as standard.

Overall quality was very good & breakfast was lovely.

Loses a star for no bath robe or slippers which is stated as standard! ",4,2019,05,18
103,William and Donna Collard,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely hotel. Olga and Chicera were so charming and kind. They were very helpful in finding great restaurants and places to visit. The rooms were gorgeous, very clean and quiet. The beds were comfortable.  We would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to stay there again. ",5,2019,05,18
103,Perfect hotel in and ideal location,"We stayed here during the week for a business trip and the hotel was perfect for our needs. The room was large for a twin room and had all the amenities you could need, with the bonus of a microwave. Room and bathroom were cleaned spotlessly every day. We had a minor issue with a door handle falling off but they dealt with it so promptly it wasn't an inconvenience. All of the checkout staff and concierge were very friendly and I would definitely look at staying here again when in London.",5,2019,05,16
103,THE PICTURES DO NOT LIE!,"What an excellent treat!  When I booked our stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court I was not expecting much, especially after having had a not so great experience in our last hotel in Paris (not related to this one at all!).   For starters, the welcome that we got by the front desk was extremely warm and welcoming.  Aside from tending to the matters of registering, the gentleman who welcomed us began talking to us about the overall area, pulled a map and began showing us where to go for dinner, and seemed genuinely content to have us in the hotel.  

Once we came to our room (across the street), I was very impressed.  The room was extremely comfortable:  large, with a nice bed, a nice large closet, desk, a nice TV, and a very nice and comfortable bathroom.  Additionally, the hotel provides to their guest a cell phone which guests can carry with them and make local AND international calls to most countries COMPLETELY FREE!  I was floored with this amenity!  this cell phone also has programmed in it the Subway Map, a direct line to the hotel in case of need and for about L$5.00/day, it can become a Hotspot which can be used anywhere.  The hotel also provides WiFi, which worked really well and the response of the front desk, at any time day or night was excellent.

The Park Grand Paddington is very centrally located:  walking distance from the Paddington Train and Subway Station, as well as the Queensway and Lancaster Gate Stations--all which make it very easy to move around London.  Also, nearby is Queensway Street which is excellent for shopping and dining... really fun street to hang around at!  Oh yes... the Italian Gardens of Hyde Park and Kensington Palace are all walking distance, and if you want to venture on a nice 30 minute walk through the park, you can go to Harrods and the shopping district.  

Lastly, the area in and of itself felt very safe, and the shops immediately around the hotel (coffee shops, groceries, etc) were all so cute, welcoming, and open quite late!

I don't have enough good things to say about the Park Grand Paddington because anything I say would fall short from how I felt staying there.  I can assure you that we will be back next time in London.",5,2019,05,15
103,Excellent,We stayed  for 3 nights. Very satisfied. Very inviting and clean. The staff was very helpful. Especially Andrei. We recommend it highly. Location was very good. The staff in reception helped us a lot and was always smiling. We slept absolutely well.,5,2019,05,13
103,Bridal Shower 11th May,"Amazing - the food, the staff, the Venue was absolutely awesome. 
We had a party of 19 and everyone enjoyed the Indian afternoon tea, the food was tasty and presentation was outstanding. I would personally like to say a big THANK YOU to Alisa and all the staff who were outstanding. Highly recommend Indian afternoon tea.",5,2019,05,13
103,Avoid at all cost,"Checked in today and writing this in my Uber to my next hotel!
Shower would not drain, towels old and smelled disgusting, mulitple unanswered calls to the front desk, me standing in the lobby with wet hair requesting a new room. Second room they showed me over looked the dumpster. REFUND!
I live in NYC, used to cramped spaces, old buildings and minimal luxuries. But could not stay here. Website is deceiving, super shabby, smelly and terribly old sunken mattresses. A hard and definite zero star rating but trip advisor requires a 1 at minimum.",1,2019,05,10
103,Honeymooners ,"Honeymooners!

We had an amazing stay. With lovely helpful staff who are professional and  the hotel was very clean.

The room was serviced everyday providing fresh towels and the bathroom cleaned.

 The tea and coffee was re stocked everyday. We are amazed at the service and that's why the rooms stay clean and perfect. 

WiFi was perfect, was fast and helpful to research where to go next. 

The room comes with a phone to make calls in the UK and maps etc. 

Breakfast was amazing. All you can eat with English breakfast, coffee, tea and Danishs 

Thank you for the pleasent stay and the gift of wine and chocolates. 

Defiantly recommend. 

The location was great with other small stores around and cafes. 

Access to the pay bikes was right outside which is great for a quick ride around.

We used uber services which was great getting to and from the hotel.

100% the best and recommend!

Thank you again!!!

William and Georgina ",5,2019,05,09
103,Good property for a good price,"We stayed here as we were attending a conference at Royal Albert Hall and this location is just a 15 -20 minute walk across Hyde Park to RAH, as well as a ten minute walk to Paddington station. It is very reasonably priced for a hotel in London and I was pleasantly surprised at how new and clean the rooms were. I had forgotten to request an early check in but the front desk was able to accommodate me and gave me a room at 10:30 in the morning which I really appreciated after flying through the night. Each room also has a local smart phone in them which you are welcome to take with you as you move about London which is extremely helpful. The one thing I did not love is that my bed was pushed into a corner of the room because the room was so small, and clearly this meant that everyone sleeps on the side of the bed opposite to the wall, meaning that the bed had a very significant slope to it. I had to sleep with a pillow propped against my side every night to lessen the sloping/rolling down hill feeling. This was room 611 so perhaps just request a different room. Other than that the stay was really good and I would stay here again.",4,2019,05,08
103,Room the size of a phone box...,I cannot understand how Hotels in London can possibly call this a guest room!!! The room was so small that I could not even fit my small suitcase on the floor. Overpriced and terrible place to stay! Will never come back!,1,2019,05,07
103,Indian Style Afternoon Tea,"I highly recommend this experience. 5 Stars really aren't enough. 

Alisa and her colleague provided exceptional service while my friend and I enjoyed an absolutely delicious Indian style afternoon tea.  I've never experienced such wonderful service. 

This was our first Indian style tea, and it definitely won't be our last. It was truly outstanding,  The food and Masala Chai were absolutely delicious, and it was a real treat to have a whole bottle of fizz.

We'll be back to see you in the Summer, Alisa. Thank You to you and your colleague for making our afternoon absolutely amazing xx",5,2019,05,06

103,two nights stay,"Olga is a very warm and helpful receptionist. I booked two nights stay in a single room, and when arrived, the only available room is on  the ground floor. The next day Olga helped me upgrade to a double room on a higher floor! Would recommend a stay there.",5,2019,05,05
103,Not coming back here,"Poor service. Never seen such lethargy where upon repeated reminders staff don't turn up or don't do what's promised. The used glasses are lying in my room since few days - I arrive late at night - and no one has bothered to collect them Inspite of repeated calls. 

Basic things like water is not provided in the room without a charge even in club double room. Quite a cheap approach.

The management staff do not have customer service training - they say no to everything because 'it's a management policy'.",1,2019,05,03

103,"Lovely Hotel, Quiet Area, Amazingly Clean",The hotel is in a quiet area which is only 5-10 minute walk from Kensington Gardens / Hyde Park. The hotel is amazingly clean and all staff we dealt with were friendly and very helpful. Compared with other 4* hotels in the area this hotel comes at a very nice price.,5,2019,05,01
103,Convenient for Paddington,"I must admit I was a little disappointed. It looked good in all the pictures but the room was very small (you could not get into bed on both sides but had to climb over the second person to get in and out), the fittings were tired (broken window & missing 'fridge) and there was nowhere to hang coats or anything longer than a blouse as shelves had been put into the hanging space. Otherwise ok as it was clean, the staff were helpful and there were toiletries, a safe and tea and coffee making facilities).",3,2019,05,01
103,A good find!,"We booked the advanced rate that included breakfast. The hotel is right by Hyde Park. We walked through Hyde Park to Mayfair for Tapas, and then the following day to Kensington. 

Breakfast was great. Room was more than adequate and service was excellent on reception. I would have no issues recommending this hotel for a short break in London, and certainly based on the price. We particularly like the area immediately around the hotel. We have already booked to go back at the end of May! ",5,2019,05,01
103,Nice stay in Paddington,"Hotel is a nice place to stay, close to Hyde Park where u can have fresh air and have some running.

103,Thumbs up,"I was originally booked for the Grand Royale London Hyde Park but due to a water issue in a few rooms, I was moved to Grand Paddington Court (their sister property).  At first I wasn’t pleased as I was really looking forward to the royal feel & decor of Grand Royale but I really ended up enjoying my stay at Grand Paddington.  It’s has a more modern look & feel which was not what I was after in London but the staff was friendly, the rooms were comfortable and clean and the Buffett breakfast was good.",5,2019,04,30

Booking was easy and they remembered that we were both vegetarian.",5,2019,04,28

Super friendly staff and service. Small but big enough and very clean! Will be back next year ofcourse!! Chiara thanks for the great hospitality!,5,2019,04,28
103,A Wonderful Stay!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my three-night stay. The hotel is a short walk from the Heathrow Express train, and within easy reach of the Tube as well as multiple bus lines. It is just five minutes to Hyde Park as well. The staff are friendly and helpful. George at the front desk gets a special shout out! I also appreciate the breakfast staff. I booked a Club Double, and was pleased with it. The bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, the bathroom quite nice with a great shower, and the hotels provided a number of amenities-- a smartphone with which you can make international calls for free, coffee service, nice bath products, fresh fruit. The room also had a microwave and fridge.

I enjoyed the hot breakfast each morning. I checked out the fitness room, a small space int he basement with cardio equipment and some weights. I chose to do power walking through London instead. 

So why not five stars? The room was a bit cozy. And there was some noise from the corridor and other rooms. I manged to sleep well despite that. I'd stay here again and highly recommend it.",4,2019,04,27

103,Relegated to the dungeon,"I stayed at this hotel for the last three nights. I’ve been looking for a decent hotel in Paddington because I travel here about 4 times a year. Historically I’ve stayed at the Hilton but I was hoping to cut my costs a little. When I arrived, I was a little surprised by the lobby which in the photos looks grand but in reality in was small and a little worn. Since I had just flown from the US, I asked about room service which I thought on the website was 24/7. Instead, they handed me a brochure for Chicago pizza. Then I was given my key and was escorted across the street and down a flight of stairs into the basement of the building where I was shown my 8 x6 foot room. To give it credit, it was clean and very functional but my view was of a wall. The noise in the morning was extensive. I think that the housekeepers had their work closet next to my room so there was repeated door slamming. While the website looks like they might have some nice rooms but 651 was not it. I felt like an outcast and really saw nothing else of the hotel. If I were to stay here, I would insist on a room in the main building above ground!",3,2019,03,31
103,London visit,"Park grand Paddington court is a very central hotel in London. The stay was very pleasant.
 It’s clean, great ambience and serves the purpose for short visit.

Alrich was on the front desk and helped me with hassle free checkin, he really make me feel I’m home. He was star of the day for me as he sorted me out with best rates for money change, how do I get SIM card, WiFi and Mimi brief of the place. Dario was another guy who was amazing, he was very soft spoken and assisted me with moving around, map of the place and suggested some hidden gems of paddington.

Location is perfect, 7 mins from Paddington Railway station walking. Rooms are clean and very tidy. Housekeeping is great. It’s a great value for money.",5,2019,03,30

103,Ok hotell,"Stayed at this hotel for three nights. It was okay, the room was small but worked. The room was incredibly cold, and even when we turned up the heating it did not help. The floor in the beathroom was burning hot, and we could not stand on it without a towel on it. There was a lot of noise in the room from pidgeons. Overall it was an okay stay, nothing special.

103,Laura’s Wonderful Experience!,"My granddaughter and stayed at the Park Grand at Paddington Court from March 3-7 and had the most wonderful experience!  Upon arrival, Madelina and Kanesha went above and beyond to make sure that we had everything we needed. 
Our room was very clean and bed was comfy and bathroom sparkling clean. The hotel offers an English Breakfast that is so delicious and everyone is very friendly and helpful. I would like to mention Elena and Steve from the in-house restaurant whose service was outstanding!  Every time I called the front desk or needed assistance, Olga, Cosmina, Osbert and Alrich were extremely professional and courteous.  I was so impressed with everyone that I made notes of their names!

I would also highly recommend this hotel because of its location:  it is in central London and there is easy access from Paddington Station to the famous sights and shopping in London. Near the Paddington Station is the “Big Bus” stop for a great sightseeing experience in London!  Around the area are great eateries, fruit shops, pharmacy, hospital, and foreign exchange outlets and souvenir shops. 

I plan on staying at this hotel when I return to London because the price is very reasonable for the excellent service given there and the ideal location. I highly suggest that you check this place out —you will be very happy that you did!",5,2019,03,25
103,"A very nice hotel, great location awesome staff","I stayed for 7 days at this hotel, on the day I got here my room was a bit small, so I commented that with the staff.

The location is it's best feature, very close to Paddington and to Lancaster Gate, so you can go anywhere from there.
The room was very clean and comfortable, the bathroom was also new and very clean. I would definitely stay again in this hotel.
My best regards to all staff members that made me feel welcome and at home.",5,2019,03,25
103,"Stay away from the properties in this chain - ""the Shaftesbury Hotels"" do ""Shaft"" you....","A byzantine labyrinth layout, I had quite some issues finding my room, a room that ideally fits dwarf sized travelers as it had a surface of  2 1/2 single beds, single glazing - cold and noise has no trouble reaching you if you are a light sleeper. The walls are similarly single ""glazed"": you hear steps of other travelers in the hallway through the wall, if they talk you can follow the conversation without any effort......

Of course hotels are for profit - yet the Shaftesbury folks cut corners at every opportunity, and clearly do not care about your comfort, your convenience and what you expect as quality lodging. After a similar experience at at another hotel of this chain three years ago, I somehow ended up here after my new assistant booked me into this chain again. 

Oh dear.....",1,2019,03,25

103,Good price at a great location,Had one night after completing business in London and wanted to stay close to the Paddington Express. The Park Grand is less than 15 minutes walk and provided a reasonable price on the room and a business where I completed my meetings.  Its an old style hotel so there is no elevator up to the rooms in the annex but their bell staff is both efficient and attentive.  I also like the fully repleinished complimentary bar in the room with a microwave had I wanted to do takeaway dinner.  Its also a short ride on the tube to Leichester Square so I was able to grab a show for my last night in town.  ,5,2019,03,24
103,Nice stay! ,"Comfy and clean room and very friendly staff, recommended! The location is also very great, very close to hyde park and kensington gardens and the old city center. Very comfortable bed, clean bathroom, airco,.. Good value and I will come back here next time! ",5,2019,03,24
103,Best Biriyani by Chef Altaf,"The food cooked by Chef Altaf is amazing. The biriyani is a must have from here! Had biriyanis all over London and this is the best place by far. 

If you are around Paddington, this place is a must stop for biriyani lovers!",5,2019,03,23

103,Nice Hotel in a good location for London Paddington ,"Stayed here for 3 nights for my wife’s birthday. 

The hotel is a short walk from London Paddington Train Station. About 5-10 minutes away. Check in was painless with friendly receptionist on duty. 

Stayed in Room 312. Nice, tidy room with 2 twin beds put together to make one king size bed. Comfortable beds and a good night’s sleep after touring London. This room overlooked the rear of the hotel which meant there was hardly any street noise. 

Bathroom was fine if, for me, not much elbow room at the sink. Good shower with a choice of overhead spray or shower rail spray. Plenty of hot water and decent pressure. The only way to judge a good hotel; clean, comfy bed, good shower! Maid service cleaned the room daily. 

Overall, a nice hotel that I would recommend to anyone.

",5,2019,03,19
103,"Good location and quiet, concierge service basic","Very good location, 5min walking from paddignton and Hyde park. Clean and quiet room. The only thing that could be improved is the concierge service as it was quiet generic and basic. I had made some research before traveling. Thank you",3,2019,03,19
103,Fantastic Stay,"The entire staff was friendly and helpful. I forget the desk agent's name that handled the check-in process upon a very early arrival (March 15, 2019) in London but she was very helpful in squaring away the details for a room I had just booked approximately an hour before being on-prem. 

I booked a single room and it fit my needs perfectly. The room was perfect for a single traveler set on sight seeing across London. Additionally the hotel is located just a short walk from both Paddington station and Lancaster Gate which made accessing the Underground very easy.

My check out was handled by George and he notified me that my ride to the airport was waiting for me outside at 4:30 AM. 

I recommend this hotel for those who look to travel on a modest budget by still prefer modern amenities.",4,2019,03,19
103,Excellent!!’,"Hotel staff was really friendly. They took really good care. Breakfast was excellent. Kenith,Alrich,Dario and Olga was really friendly. Location is central close to all amenities and really good restaurants nearby.",5,2019,03,19
103,How do they do it?,I was fortunate enough to stay here with my family for over 4 days and this hotel and especially the staff exceeded by expectetations. Alrich and George of the night shift helped us even late at night to plan our tickets and journey for the next day to the minutest detail. Their level of patience to deal with our constant questions was beyond commendable. I Definitely have to mention that it wouldn't have been possible to have a smooth trip if it wasn't for the recommendations given by them.  Overall the hotel is great with location and food too and I would definitely recommend it while visiting London. The hotel has unbelievable quality which should be fine experienced by anyone looking for a comfortable stay.,5,2019,03,18
103,Mr Minzheng Li,Chiara was very helpful when I needed help. She was very enthusiastic and helpful to help me coordinate my work. I am very fortunate to meet such a service staff and look forward to seeing you next time.,5,2019,03,18
103,Great,"Nice hotel. Nice staff, especially at breakfast, but you know when a place takes that one step forward to make you think, yeah, I WILL come back here and make it clear to my friends where the place is..? Well, it happened to me...I had extended my stay and when I needed to request a late check out, (and I mean late)...4!...they himmed and haad but took the step. It made a Hugh difference to me as I am awaiting a special visa for my passport from an agency around the corner to fly out tonight to Riyadh and it’s a long trip. It was ALL down to the charming Roman, Ciara, on the front desk who got the apple off the tree for me and made Riyadh seem a little closer. Gracie, mille gracie!",5,2019,03,18
103,Park Grand Paddington Court - A Home Away From Home,Thoroughly enjoyed my 4 nights stay at Park Grand Paddington Court. Totally exceeded my expectations. From check-in to check-out I experienced 5-start service with the warmest smile. Chiara at front desk was exceptional throughout my stay... Definitely coming back!,5,2019,03,18
103,Great location and service,"We stayed here on a combined business trip and holiday last year.  

Originally I made the mistake of booking a deluxe double room - which we found was way too small and too little storage for a couple staying for a week or more.  I'm sure it would be perfectly fine for a short business visit but not for an extended stay.

After talking to the hotel manager we were able to get moved into a larger room for the remainder of our stay and also for our return visit after a weekend in Paris.  And in both cases there were no additional charges!  How great is that?

The rooms were modern, tidy, with the usual things you would expect - aircon, wi-fi etc.  The location is peaceful and quiet with no night noise.  It is only a few blocks from Paddington Station and from Hyde Park.  Plenty of nearby cafes and restaurants to choose from.

The hotel staff were friendly and courteous.  We always felt welcome and were greeted as we came and went.",4,2019,03,16
103,Miss,Nice hotel and good service. Really had good time to stay here. The lounge is good and room is cleaned everyday. They also provide free late checkout. Good location as well. Very close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate,5,2019,03,16

103,London stay,We had a lovely stay for our anniversary. The service was fantastic as we arrived early before the theatre and we were able to check in and then leave our bags. Then we arrived back very late but they got our bags and showed us to our room straight away. The room was very comfy and quiet. It was our anniversary so they left rose petals on the bed which was lovely. The sockets weren’t working when we arrived however once we told the staff they fixed it straight away. The breakfast was lovely and again the staff were very friendly and attentive. I would definite recommend it for a reasonable priced place to stay in London.,4,2019,03,15
103,Great Checkin,"Chiara was so welcoming at check-in. I was given an option to upgrade my room for a small additional amount so it’s all good now. Chiara made everything smooth & quick. Thanks a bunch!
Location is good as well.",5,2019,03,15
103,Really disappointed - wouldn’t recommend ,"Tiny room, bedside table not clean, room thermostat didn’t work, so I was freezing cold. 

After a terrible nights sleep, tiny bed, duvet literally just touched the edges so every time I rolled over I was cold.

103,Nice and cozy ,"I think it has a great location near Lancaster Gate station. Short distance to Hyde Park and the central line subway.
Nice pubs nearby.
Excellent service and good breakfast.
Nice but very small rooms and very small Queen size bed. 
But the bathroom was good.
And the room had a small fridge and safe.
You could also cook coffee or tea in the room. 
We enjoyed our stay. ",4,2019,03,11

103,Fas,Excellent service and very kind staff. The hotel is very clean and not to crammed. Would highly recommend for a group of friends. Olga and lav were fantastic and the hotel is a walking distance from the  City Centre.,5,2019,03,08
103,Cozy but very nice 2 night stay,"It is said to expect London hotel rooms to be on the smaller, cozier side and I found that very true for our room.  It was clean, relatively quiet, with blackout drapes but it was small.  Luckily I was traveling with my daughter rather than my 6'4"" tall husband so we managed in the double bed. Fitting in the 2 normal size suitcases worked but we were stepping over our things.  Our room only had a shower but it had a wonderful handheld attachment as well as a rain shower head.  Amenities included coffee, tea and 2 bottles of water as well as your typical shampoo and conditioner and shower cap. Staff was very welcoming, helpful and friendly. Location was convenient with a 4-block walk to Paddington Station.  There are 2 small convenience stores, a liquor store and a very sweet French cafe right on the corner. Be careful though, there are several Park Grand Hotels very close to each other so make sure you know which one you are staying in.",4,2019,03,07
103,Trip to London ,"Had a super nice time! Best service, clean and comfortable room, and very yammy breakfast. Very very nice!!!

The staff were very polite and helpful. I would definitely stay there again. My colleagues were all happy with the hotel and service from the staff.,5,2019,03,06
103,AMAZING!!!!!!,1st time away with my boyfriend and JUST WOW!!!! We were treated and looked after so well. Beautiful room!! Massive thanks to Olga and Purbi. Thank you for making our stay so beautiful and we WILL be back!!,5,2019,03,05
103,Very Good Stay,"Polite, courteous staff. Very clean.
Small room but perfectly adequate for our two night stay.
Excellent shower and bathroom facilities.
Good breakfast , helpful staff in nice surroundings. We would use again",4,2019,03,04
103,Not the best,"I stayed in a small room, ground floor at the end of the hall and at the base of the staircase (Room 4 I think). It was tiny and barely enough space for 1 person. 

I had problems with the electrical sockets in the room above the desk (the socket kept coming out of wall), and the Heating and Air Conditioning system seemed to not work properly with the room getting very cold. I voiced the complaint to the front desk staff and they said they would get it fixed. When I returned later that day, the socket had been pushed back into the wall, and the the heating had been left on. Next day, the socket came out again, and the heating went back to being weak even though I set the temperature to 27C. Rather than keep complaining about the same thing again, I simply used another socket to charge my phone, and used the hairdryer to heat the room. My opinion is that you should only have to complain once for something to be fixed. 

Note that the room does not contain a fridge so bringing in items for your own breakfast is impossible. 

Another basic problem with the room is that thermostat is in the separate closed area between the bedroom and the hallway. In order to get the benefit of soundproofing the room, the door between the bedroom and this closed area must be shut. But the heating vent is in the bedroom. So, the thermostat can't register the temperature as it is essentially in another room. Basic design error! (I'm a design engineer in case you're wondering).

Great location for the hotel, and staff were quite friendly but I wouldn't stay here again.",2,2019,03,04
103,"A b&b that is perfectly located, offering average prices, worth trying for one or two nights.","Stayed for two nights in the hotel.
The room was ok size wise for London standards and quality of sleep was ok.
Cleanliness  though is not the strong point of this hotel. While moving the beds to pick a pen  two unused packets of condoms and a honey portion were recovered. 
Carpet was not really cleaned from previous spills.
Towels are small and need replacement. More toiletries are required to make your life easier.
Breakfast, served in the basement is good in quantity but not in quality.",3,2019,03,03

103,Good location and convenient club room,"Our club room was actually located across the street in the Devonshire. So for breakfast we had to cross the street to get to the main building's restaurant. Breakfast was sufficient, with an option of freshly cooked omlette. The club room in the Devonshire 4th floor was larger than London average hotel rooms. Our view was towards the backside (not towards the street), didn't have any noise problems. Heating adjusting didn't really work for us. We were pleasantly surprised that there were multiple USB charging ports in the room. Fridge was also a useful feature. Staff was very friendly and helpful.",4,2019,03,01

103,Wonderful staff and superb hotel,"I am very grateful to the wonderful staff who supported my daughter after eye surgery in February. They honestly could not have done more,from running around putting medication in their fridge every fours hours,constantly asking if we needed anything and enquiring how she was every time that I saw one of them. We were put in a twin club room which was perfect.The shower had a rainforest head and a detachable hand held one which was great for my daughter. Breakfast was lovely with many choices including fresh fruits and smoked salmon.The hotel is an eight minute walk from Paddington rail station and a similar distance from Hyde Park,which was lovely for a stroll. Local restaurants were good also. I can highly recommend the hotel and I will certainly stay the next time we visit London.",5,2019,02,26

103,A disappointing stay.,"The staff were polite and professional. The room was much smaller than anticipated. It was located near the lifts so we had constant noise from people coming up or going down. This was very annoying and disturbed our sleep.
The window had  blockout curtains  but in spite of this there was still constant bright light during the night coming from the fire detector on the ceiling. So we couldn't sleep comfortably.
The area was not as central as we liked it to be but we used the underground for most of the time. 
All in all it was ok because it was clean.",3,2019,02,20
103,Very nice little hotel convenient to Paddington Station,"I spent two nights at this hotel: 

The staff were extremely kind and helpful. I arrived early in the morning from the U.S. and no rooms were available yet, but they let me take a little nap in the business lounge while I waited. The sleeping room itself was a bit of a pain to get to, through a maze of hallways and up endless stairs (not accessible by lift, but again the staff was very helpful and accommodating and carried my luggage up for me. 

My room was very tiny but clean, attractive and comfortable. The breakfast was decent. The location was great, just a very short walk from Paddington Station so I could easily take the Tube or a train wherever I wanted to go.",4,2019,02,19

103,Fantastic stay!!!,"I honestly can't say a bad thing about this place. From the moment we walked in we felt so welcome. After a fast check in we were offered by the lovely gentleman at the front desk if we needed any help with our bags. After spending 11 hours on a bus from Glasgow to London,  it was safe to say we were shattered and in deep need of a shower.  We felt better as soon as we walked into the room,  It was so fresh and clean. We had been provided with the usual tea,  coffee and biscuits but also the added extras like the bottles of water, a little fridge etc. Everything was so cosy,the bed was very comfy and after being busy each day in London it was always nice going back to our room where the lovely men/women had been in to tidy up and make our bed. Unfortunately we only experienced the breakfast which amazing! Self serving which I prefer but the offer was there for the chef to cook you up some fried eggs or an omelette. I wish we had taken more time to experience everything that this hotel had to offer (bar, restaurant,gym) we will just have to come back again!!  Honestly can't thank everyone at the Paddington enough for kindness and hospitality.  See you all soon!!",5,2019,02,18

Great rest and quiet neighborhood. Close to padington station which connects directly to heathrow through “heathrow express”...

",5,2019,02,16
103,Not what it claims to be,"We booked this hotel as it was supposedly a four star hotel and the room we had reserved was a ""Deluxe Double Room"".  Well!!  The room was in a building opposite the main hotel building and had been used for about 18 months as rooms for the hotel.  The room was very small - a small bed and little room on one side between the bed and the wall. There was a telephone on one bedside table which took up most of the table.
The cupboard where we supposedly would hang our coats had an ironing board in, which blocked usage of the cupboard. (Who needs an iron when staying in a hotel in central London?).  In the bathroom there was no space where to put our toiletries as the sink covered the whole top.
We were shown over to the room but with no explanation of the facilities and there was nothing to explain what there was.  The light switches were ones we had never seen before. We did get them to do what they were supposed to do after a bit of work!
Not our idea of a deluxe doulble room in a four star hotel.",2,2019,02,15

The location is fantastic, a few blocks from the Paddington train station, a couple blocks from the beautiful Kensington Gardens and a short walk to Notting Hill.

I had a single room that was very small, but functional and clean, with a nice shower. Bed was a bit short and I'm not the tallest.

Nothing was too much trouble and she took the time to explain each different flavour pastry to us , also as i am vegetarian she made sure i only got suitable food . She was a lovely happy smiley professional girl and an asset to the company . We also had a chat with the reception staff on duty that night ( early evening )  they were also charming people .

Great neighborhood with a short walk to two Tube stations (Paddington and Lancaster Gate), Hyde Park, and numerous cafes and convenience stores (some open 24 hours).  Bathroom floors are heated and the TVs are the biggest I’ve ever seen in a London hotel. And, the window opens!
There are a few stairs to navigate within the hotel, but the bellmen are happy to help with luggage. I wouldn’t suggest it for someone who had trouble with steps (FYI it’s London so there are steps EVERYWHERE), but I thought it was charming. Tried the breakfast a few times and it was great too!

103,Reception has an interesting approach,"I used to stay at this hotel almost every week. It was ok. Then they stuck me in the annex for three nights. I hardly slept due to the noise. I decided not to stay again. 

Then the other hotel I use was full for the week so I fo9und myself back there. 

The stay began interestinglly where I was booked in to a room tha was already occupied. Both she amdm I were suprised. Back to reception - receptionist looked at the screen and said 'Ah' as if noticing for the first time that the system was saying the room was already occupied. No apology or explanation to me. 

Then 'you're in the annex' keys shoved over the desk. I said 'i'd really rather not - last time I was in there I didn't sleep at all' 

'If there is a noise problem just report it' - ' I did that last time and nothing happened' 

Keys given to me -'We have no other rooms', 

My room - directly across from the hotel in line with the front door, Single glazed windows. All night taxis pulling up in front of the hotel, people slamming car doors and shouting to each other. I phoned reception. No answer. 

I will never stay here again.",3,2019,02,05
103,Excellent Service,"Wonderful service! Everyone was so very polite and friendly. I needed to extend my stay at the hotel, and did so at the front desk.

103,Anniversary celebration,"We stayed at the Park Grand Paddington court for the 1st time to celebrate 4 years together.
I had left a note on booking.com to ask for 2 champagne glasses so we could celebrate, but when we got there they did SO much more for us.
When we went to reception the staff were so friendly and bubbly, we instantly felt welcomed. They told us they had upgraded our room at no extra charge and congratulated us on 4 years together.
When we got to the room is was beautiful! Lovely and large, and the bathroom had underfloor heaters (which came in handy one day as we hit a massive rain fall so had to dry our clothes).
When we were in the room we got a knock on the door to which the lovely ladies from Reception brought up a bottle of bubbly, chocolates and glasses for us to celebrate with a beautiful card wishing us a great stay.
As if this wasn’t enough, when we went out for a walk we came back and they had created 2 towel swans on the bed and covered it in beautiful petals....I have never had a hotel treat me this nice and was really touched.
We had no issues in the hotel other than the hotel room could get a bit cold. We had a fire alarm evacuation on our last night due to a customers misusing their room, a few people complained but I was just happy to see the hotel had working alarm systems so I felt safe.
As an apology they treated us to a free breakfast in the morning which again was a fabulous gesture given most hotels would just apologise and leave it at that. 
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we would return again...but maybe in the sunny when London isn’t so cold.",5,2019,02,02

103,Great location and service,"Stayed here with my partner for a night. Aweso.e location. 3 min walk from paddington station, which is a main station that connects you to all the undergrounds. Area is a residential area so a lot of people going for walks in the morning. 

Food was great. Pork sausages were delicious and they had mini nutella packages and other treats for us to go for our trip to see the touristy attractions.",5,2019,01,31
103,"Cold, cramped, and unhelpful reception let down a well-located hotel","The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to Paddington, just a 5-minute walk. 

The staff were sort of friendly at check-in but I wouldn’t say it made the stay worthwhile. It’s a pretty typical central London hotel, tiny hallways, tiny rooms, tiny bar area. Fairly clean and well-kept though.

The room itself felt like a college dorm. I usually stay in Canary Wharf because the hotels are bigger, cheaper, and much nicer, but a friend was coming off a red-eye into London so I booked this place for the Tube-less walk from the station. 

The walls are really thin. The people in the room next to us came in around 10 pm on a Wednesday night and had their outside/party voices on until at least 3 AM. I wished I had a tuba to go play outside their door. I’ve never been so close to calling reception to ask them kindly to please tell these people to shut up, but I let it go. For a “deluxe twin” I can’t really say there was anything deluxe about it as the room had all the basic amenities one would expect in a non-“deluxe” room. The beds were really close together, with one shoved up against the window. We turned the heating on in the room and halfway through the night, as other reviewers have mentioned, the heating turned itself off. We woke to being able to see our own breath in the room, with only a thin, flimsy duvet on the beds. The bathroom was tiny with nowhere to set anything, though nicely done up. 

In general, it feels like they could have a bit more attention to detail. I.e. one of the lights was broken and when I unplugged my phone charger, the socket came right out of the wall. Basically it was a very cold, tiny room in good proximity to Hyde Park, Paddington, and the Central line. Weigh the location against the cramped, cold settings and the obnoxiously thin walls.

The worst bit was at check-out. I requested a receipt and the man at the desk wouldn’t give me one. I’ve never had this happen before. I usually book through Booking.com, as I did this time, and he said because I did, he could not give me a receipt, that I would have to get it from them. Never been told that anywhere in my probably 8 years of using Booking. I told him I needed a receipt to receive a price-match refund from Booking (the hotel’s own website offered the room with breakfast at the same price as Booking offered the room WITHOUT breakfast), but he still wouldn’t. He was also a bit smirky. Not impressed, so sorry to say, I wouldn’t recommend. ",3,2019,01,31
103,Great prices,"Second time at this hotel - booked luxury Double room last minute. Bargain price of £120 with breakfast. 
Checked in then taken across the road where there’s a reception desk. Our room was small but nicely decorated & very clean. Lovely ( Tiny)  bathroom with underfloor heating. 
Great lighting system in rooms , microwave & fridge too. 
Plus bathrobes in room. 

Not had breakfast before & initially wasn’t happy that we had to go across the road for it -short walk literally across the road but it was cold being January. 

All was forgiven because the dining room is nice, great breakfast & friendly service. 

This hotel doesn’t rip you off with London prices, it’s clean, modern & staff are lovely. ",5,2019,01,30
103,Paddington Court Executive Rooms,"The Executive Rooms are in a building opposite the main hotel.

103,Business Stop - Great Hotel,"Stayed here for a night whilst in London on business. The hotel is in a great location and very reasonably priced considering other local options. The room was small and compact, but pleasant, tidy and more than perfect to get your head down. If you was on a family trip, staying for a period of time, or want a spacious room it’s probably not for you, but if you want somewhere to base and get some sleep, this is a perfect hotel.

103,Lovely accessible hotel,"Had a wonderful time at Park Grand Paddington Court. At first our room was very small, something that is just part of the charm of this London area. As my mother has a bad knee, the room was too small for her comfort. There were some stairs leading to the room which was also a bit much for my mother. They do have lifts but our original room was after the lifts and down a short few steps. The staff was very understanding and extremely accommodating, they happily switched our room to a larger more comfortable one. Even made sure that it was at no extra cost.  Staff was absolutely wonderful and so welcoming. The rooms were very clean and cosy. They have some delicious biscuits(cookies) to go along with the tea, which we would have loved to have again but were only there on arrival. Rooms have a microwave, a kettle and a mini fridge. Perfect location to all the sights, which are all about a 20 minute tube ride away. Trains to Windsor Castle are 5 minutes away!  We did not try the breakfast or restaurant or the bar. All together was a lovely time. ",4,2019,01,25
103,Exceptional staff Members,The hotel itself may or may not meet your expectations on four star hotels but the staff members will do their best for you to feel like you are at 5+ hotel. Olga and Alex were extremely helpful. Very good location too.,4,2019,01,24

103,Visiting london,"This is the third time for me in this hotel. Everything was great and I really enjoyed my stay here, the room was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is very close to the center and the hyde park.",5,2019,01,16
103,Superb place to stay....but tiny bathroom,"We booked here for a four day stay in London and first appearances are that it looks appealing from the outside which, if you travel to the capital a lot, can be a sign of things to come.

A five minute walk from Paddington Station, the hotel ticks all of the boxes for a London stay, it's close to bar/restaurants/attractions you name it, it's within easy reach.

We had booked a Club room for a little extra luxury and to be fair it didn't disappoint, modern, attractive room which was spotlessly clean, with fruit and a bottle of wine to welcome you as well as the usual tea/coffee/biscuits and soft drinks.

The rooms are very warm, and the bathroom has a heated floor which, if you're not careful, can give the feet a bit of a burn.

The bed was extremely comfortable, so much so that the wife wanted to know the mattress brand to buy for home.

The staff are polite and helpful and are always on hand.

Now for the downsides. Our room was up a flight of stairs and then down a couple more, there was a lift but for a different section of the hotel, so be careful, if like me, you struggle with stairs, make sure you inform the hotel beforehand to ensure you get a suitable room. Something I hadn't done in this occasion assuming that the lifts/elevators advertised were to all rooms.

The biggest downfall for me was the bathroom. It was fresh and modern but so tiny.

In fact it was so small, having used the toilet and washed my hands, I had to step back to the toilet, often catching myself on the toilet bowl, to open the door to get out. I would like to have given this a five star review as it pretty much deserves one but even in a Travelodge you get enough space in a bathroom to at least get dried after a shower.

That said, I would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,01,16
103,Good for the price!,"I was there for a weekend, the Deluxe room was very nice but small. Prices are good, highly recommended for a short stay, location is very good, close to Paddington train station and underground. (we didn't try the breakfast).",4,2019,01,15
103,Never again!,"Stayed here for one night from the 11.-12. October 2018. My mother and sister arrived before me and had already checked in to my room where they left some of my belongings. When I arrived shortly before midnight the key card failed. It turned out that my room had been double booked and other occupants had moved in, in the mean time. My belongings had been moved to my mother and sisters room without them being informed. When this was brought to the staffs attention they allocated me another room which was already occupied (luckily the guests were still out and weren't sleeping yet!). This happened twice before they found a room for me. By this time it was past midnight. I felt unsafe and slept terribly all night, wondering if the next guests would walk in on me. The staff seemed untrained and was unprofessional constantly blaming ""temporary"" workers, not admiting their mistake or apologizing. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.",2,2019,01,15
103,Great room!,"Stayed for one night in December, and found the check in process very easy and quick.  The walk to the room was not obvious, but the room itself was a good size with plenty of space and the bathroom was very tidy.  
The bar whilst small was easily accessible had a reasonable selection.

The hotel is close to Paddington train station so in a very good location.  I would recommend this hotel.",4,2019,01,15

103,Good hotel,"Chosen here in Tripadvisor, hotel is really near Paddington station (leaving station, turn right straight on for about 5 minuets).

Our room was quite small but apparently very clean.
Only negative thing is heater in toilet  which is under the floor and you really risk to burn feet.

Breakfast standard for that level, good nothing special but I have to say enough (breakfast for me is a must! I have to say nothing to complain). Waitresses and reception very kind.

So... good hotel....suggested!

I love the fact it’s close to Paddington station, where you can walk to it directly from the airport, you have couple of grocery stores and good restaurant next to it for a quick snack and other essential needs + it’s far away from the city which is good “ noise city “
And you have two tube stations next to you whenever it takes you wherever you want. 

The Hotel is Great, the staff are very welcoming such as Purbasha who checked us in gratefully and took care of our luggage & Chiara who was very wonderful in helping us seeing out different location throughout the city.

As I mentioned this is my fourth time coming g and not going to be the Last! 

",5,2019,01,08
103,Excellent stay.,This is my second time staying in this hotel and I would totally recommend it to others. It is far from the noise of the city and close to paddington station which is a plus. The bed is super comfy and the room is excellent depending of the size that you book. It is warm and cozy with good facilities. The room service is always there when you need help. The people how work there are very friendly. Chiara made us feel at home with her little talk with us in the morning. Again .. you wont be disappointed by your stay. 💯,5,2019,01,08
103,Good hotel for a weekend stay,"Me and my two friends stayed at this hotel for our weekend in London. The hotel was nice and is divided into different buildings. 

We arrived late on a Friday evening and were guided to our room, which was in the building across from the lobby. 

The staff were very polite and the room was nice and clean. We had a queen sized bed and an extra bed which both were comfortable. 

The hotel provided us with a few water bottles, sodas and a few small snacks which was nice since we arrived late in the evening. 

The hotel is located right next to Hyde Park and is a short walk from Paddington Station which has direct trains from Heathrow airport. 

I think this hotel is good for weekends, for couples or for friends.

103,Excellent staff Mr Dario & Mr Zdravko,"The hotel was clean, situated in good location, though it was very small compacted rooms. we faced problem in our booked rooms  in the first day but Mr Dario was very polite and cooparative and solved the problem and gave us complemantery breakfast which was good. Mr Zdravko also was vary kind and helped us to find our rooms and carry our luggage",4,2019,01,07

103,"Fantastic, amazing and so friendly","I stayed in this hotel with my daughter for her 5th birthday. The staff could not do enough for us especially Olga & Cosmina. There was a small problem when we arrived which ment we had to wait a little for a room to become available but the staff  upgraded us as an apology. The room was beautiful and the bed was huge.  They also provided my daughter with a surprise birthday breakfast the following morning and cake with a candle during our afternoon tea later that day (which was exceptional) The two girls decorated our room with pink balloons, a teddy a card and some chocolates which absolutely made my daughters day. Everyone was so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you to everyone at park grand Paddington Court, You made my daughters birthday one to remeber and we will definitely be returning again soon x Natalie & Marnie x",5,2019,01,06
103,Comfy stay,"Me and my partner stayed here for a night whilst visiting the area. When arriving we were greeted with friendly faces and willing to help. The hotel is very nice with a good little gym room and small bar. We stayed in room 139 which took us around 15 - 20 mins to actually find as the signage wasn’t very clear and there was a lot of stairs. When we eventually got to the room it was small but really nice and comfortable. The bathroom had heated floor which was a really nice touch and the beds were lovely to sleep in. The only downfall is that personally I would have liked to have an option of teas to have in the room as there was only earl grey which was a disappointment as I love an English breakfast in the morning.
Very good value for money and close to restaurants and  bars. Will defo return! ",5,2019,01,06
103,Great value for price,"Hotel has good location (metro 5 min, Hyde park 7..)  clean and nice rooms with super friendly staff. They even prepared some little surprice for us.  I can only recommend. Next time we will not miss the 5 o'clock tea! ",5,2019,01,06
103,Anniversary celebration,"We came to visit London as a whole family. The stay was pleasant, the staff was great. The had some chocolates put on our beds as we were celebrating our anniversary.

103,Christmas stay ,"This was the second time I was staying at the hotel and it was as good or even better than my first experience here. The staff was lovely as usual and they’d upgraded my room to a bigger one :) with some Christmas themed chocolates on the bed. At happy hour they had these delicious cheese balls. And I’d recommend this place to anyone planning to visit London for a holiday. As a whole the place had a great Christmas vibe, with pleasant people and lot of complementary confectionaries.

Also the hotel is near the hyde park, Oxford Street & edgware road. So if you are staying in the hotel ask for miss olga and mr zdravko they wont let you dwon!",5,2018,12,30
103,Would not recommend apart from location,"I read the reviews before booking and it looked like a great place to stay. I booked it as a Christmas present so I could take my partner to winter wonderland and grab a few drinks out without having to travel an hour home after. The location was very good for this. 

However, I feel you are lured into a false sense of luxury. They have someone carry your bags to your room, which was nice, till they opened the door for the room. It was tiny, and super overpriced! The pictures make it look much bigger than it really is. Me and my partner could barely move in it. The bed was pushed right up against the window to the point the curtains were stuck between the bed and the wall. You couldn’t even opened the wardrobe properly because it would have a side bed draw. The room was a little dirty, the carpets looked worn and not cleaned properly, there was also dust in certain areas. The desk chair had a rip in it, there were dirt marks on the wall, pillows felt super cheap, and the blanket was thin. The temperature kept changing by itself, and we was left freezing throughout the night. I’m wondering whether the temperature automatically goes down past a certain time and it won’t let you change it because past a certain time in the morning it would let me put the temperature up and the room got heated fast. The tv was old and small. The whole room needs a refurbishment. I also found hair and an eyelash in the bed under the bottom topper blanket, that clearly doesn’t get cleaned often. The walls are thin as I could hear the above residents moving about with every step, and I could hear outside the door people walking past. When me and my partner dropped our bags off and when to go to winter wonderland someone had left bowls outside and there was rice (at least I think it was rice, or hope it was rice) left in the corner, and was still there when we returned about 6 hours later. We went out again and came back a few hours after that and the bowls had gone but there was still rice on the carpet. The carpets through the hotel were also dirty and needed a good hoover. 

Overall, it was quite noisy and cold and unclean because of the thin walls, loud bathroom fan, and temperature not working properly. I believe some of these reviews are from people travelling over from over countries and believe this is a good hotel. I can confirm this is overpriced and not good at all for London standards, I have paid less and got much better! I would more recommend a travel lodge than this, bigger room, more quiet, better beds for less... and I think that’s saying something! Was regretting booking the room and not just paying for an Uber home!",2,2018,12,29
103,Helpfull staff,"George from the counter desk was helpfull to us and took care for double bed room instead of the twin bed room. Thank you George!
Hotelservice is good, breakfast is good.
Our room had a little strange layout between the walls and columns of the building with beds fitting exactly between and the corridors looked a little like a labyrinth. Overall no problem for a next time because of being in walking distance of the subway.",4,2018,12,28
103,Anniversary celebration,The staff made our stay at this hotel very special.  They were without exception friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable and the breakfast very good.  We will definitely stay here again.  Mr and Mrs Osterman,5,2018,12,28
103,Great stay and experience,"We stayed for 2 nights during the Christmas period and found the service to be professional and accommodating. The hotel is situated centrally with easy access to London's public transportation system especially the tube stations at Paddington and Lancaster Gate. The room was clean with good amenities.

A special thank you to George at reception for providing a warm welcome and being attentive to our needs. Keep up the great work.",5,2018,12,28
103,Mr.Adel Alshammari,"It is one of the best hotels in london, it is in very catchy location which is in between the hide park and Edgware Road and Oxford Street.
I would thank Purbasha of welcoming and serving us with a lot of things.",5,2018,12,27
103,Excellent Stay and Good customer service,I had a booking for a single room for 2 nights and I was travelling for Christmas. I was kindly upgraded to a double and it was much nicer. The room was with a street view and very quiet as well. Bed was comfortable and breakfast was very delicious. The reception team were very helpful and attended to all my requests and needs. Will stay again.,5,2018,12,27
103,Excellence beyond expectations,"I stayed at the hotel from 24th - 26th of December (yeah I know the best time of the year!). I stayed here to make it convenient for myself to be present at work (as all major transport service on these days are off), however I honestly expected a very regular hotel stay until the moment where I checked-in! Right from the Reception desk, through the Bar to my room, I was escorted by their staff (something that not every hotel practices, often you are told its on “xyz floor to the right/left etc). Next was the room which was quite spacious, spotlessly clean and the temperature perfectly cozy! (Makes me wonder how do they do that!?). Being tired from my travel and with all the cozy vibes the hotel room gave me, I decided to take a quick shower and hit the bed, once again the I was surprised by their selection of Soaps and shampoos and shower gels all being “GREEN TEA” fragrant which indeed were really some good quality products (usually hotels never pay much heed to these and provide average cheap ones) The fragrance was indeed super refreshing! 
Now since I was all set and on the bed, DAMN! I felt the worlds most comfortable bed!! It was the perfect softness one really looks forward to....... The next morning to my surprise the hotel had one of the best breakfast buffets in UK! I absolutely did not expect Mince pies, Pigs in Blankets along with a spread of the English Breakfast with choices of eggs to order! Damn that was one GRAND BREAKFAST! The servers took my breath away with their excellent and quick service along with the joyful CHRISTMAS spirit! The staff inspite of being super busy made sure everyone was catered to pretty well and with undivided attention! Post breakfast I was a little lost as public transport was closed for Christmas, however I guess the reception staff understood my concern and immediately helped get a very comfortable taxi..... on my arrival backin the evening I was once again pleasantly surprised with a welcoming Glass of Mulled Wine and some Mince pies! (This was all on the house!) Being Christmas Eve I wished to treat myself with a few drinks and hit their Bar to my amazement thier prices were ridiculously low not only that but also they served some interesting tid bits along with the drinks absolutely FREE!! I couldn’t have had a better Christmas than this!!!

Add ons: The hotel is so very well centrally situated that no matter where you wish to go (in London) you wouldn’t take long to reach! Perfect for every traveler in my opinion!
Overall, I would definitely say its a highly recommended hotel! 
A must to stay when in London!!! Thanks to the Beautiful team at Park Grand Paddington Court for making my stay overwhelmingly sweet!!!!",5,2018,12,26
103,Awesome hotel with great staff,"Stayed at a club room and the room was very nice and clean with a large comfy bed and a spacious bathroom with heated floors.

103,Expected more,"We stayed here while visiting Winter Wonderland and we were not disappointed with the hotel at all, it was close to Hyde Park and service was lovely but for the location and price of the hotel we expected more. We were located on the “3rd Floor” which was nice but there was no lift therefore we had to use the stairs, which wouldn’t be a problem if the hotel wasn’t like a maze... up one flight of stairs, through 3 corridors, up 3 flights of stairs down another corridor... you need a pit stop before reaching your room! The rooms were nice and cosy, enough room for the two of us decently spaced out and the bathroom was a reasonable size, but can’t say the same for our friend’s room down the corridor. Breakfast was nice you get a buffet option and a table service option.",3,2018,12,24
103,Comfortable stay,"The location is good, staff is amazing 
Clean rooms.The front desk staff especially Luanne and kanisha were kind enough and offered me a late check-out at 1

103,Winter wonderland stay,"We had two rooms for one night and we were all really pleased we stayed here. Staff, rooms, ambience excellent. My mistake is I didn’t book direct as we would have had breakfast included. We used Booking.com. I learnt my lesson so will always check prices etc direct and though a booking company.",5,2018,12,24
103,Good hotel,"The hotel is very good.Location is very convinient  close to edgeware road and Hyde park.The staff are very friendly especially kanisha,Dario and Chiara.The rooms are good and clean and we will come back again when we are in London.",5,2018,12,23
103,Underwhelming,"Arrived for a two night stay, location was good as near paddington underground. Took us about 20 minutes to find our room, we had been put in a room where there was no lift access and was on the top floor - not ideal to be walking up 6 flights of stairs when we had returned from walking around London all day sight seeing, there should have been access to a lift. The room was tidy and well presented but was very small, it reminded me of a cabin room on a boat and the double bed was not a full sized double. On one of the days we rang reception at 8:00am to ask for an iron and ironing board to be sent to our room, three calls and an hour and a half later and it finally arrived - on the third call the man on reception spoke to me like it was my fault that they hadn't sent an iron and I was going to be late for an attraction I had booked tickets for. Another thing was that the corridors on the second and third floor in our section of the hotel smelt like cannabis the whole weekend which was not great and people shouldn't be able to smoke drugs in the hotel! Location and hygiene of hotel was good, however everything else was underwhelming and don't think I would return. ",3,2018,12,23
103,"Lovely service, will definitely stay again.","After a long day in London it was very nice to come back to Park Grand, the staff were helpful and the room was lovely. Very cosy and would recommend to anyone who wants to sleep well. Thank you!!!!!!",5,2018,12,23

The staff are friendly, and helpful.
Im definitely enjoying my stay.",5,2018,12,23
103,Great Place,"My wife and I booked this hotel after being treated so horribly by another close by hotel. We have to say Grand Park hotel is one of the best hotels for service and comfortable stay. The customer service we received by Z Dravko - the concierge from the start was amazing, he took the time to communicate with us and helped us find to our ways around London hotspots, he treated us with utmost respect and professionally too - brilliant guy! Cosmina and Dario the head receptionist were absolutely friendly and professional pare that showed us what customer service should be like. Our rooms were upgraded for free without our knowledge and so many free complimentary products given to us in one of their best suites. I have traveled to many hotels internationally and this one by far has impressed me, I give them A++++ for customer service, friendliness and overall great place to stay. Their level of care actually warmed our hearts, it’s  very hard to find a business you can say that about. I would definitely return to this hotel in the future. Thank you guys!!",5,2018,12,22
103,Holiday,"I love the hotel.The location is perfect since it is so close to everything like edgware road,Harrods, Hyde park and oxford street and the area is so beautiful and the staff are very nice and helpful especially Cosmina she is professional and so helpful.",5,2018,12,21

103,My best hotel experience in London,"I stayed at this hotel during my business trip. I had my bed next to the window on the first night and requested for a change of the room on the second day at the reception. The reception staff Cosmina was absolutely helpful and kind in dealing with my request. She personally showed me the new room to ensure that I like the new room. The room is very clean, quiet, easy access and in good size. I also extended my stay and will definitely recommend this place to all travellers. Many thanks to all the staff at Park Grand Paddington Court especially Cosmina being so helpful during my stay.",5,2018,12,21
103,Holiday,You guys are comfortable to communicate with and very helpful. The room size is quite suitable to live in and facilities are good as well. Location is near Hyde Park and close to tube stations. Special thanks to Cosmina and Dario for helping me during my stay.,5,2018,12,20
103,Beautiful hotel 🏨 near Paddington station,"The desire for a hotel in a quiet, safe area, and with air conditioning was a must for me and my college age granddaughter.  We went during the worst heat wave In July-August and thankfully the inside of the hotel was cool and refreshing. 

Our room was a queen size bed and a twin size bed with very comfortable mattresses (and boy was I glad because I had strained my back just 3days before our trip). Generous in size, it was well appointed and very clean.  The breakfast was also excellent with hot and cold selections and coffee was perfect! 

When we checked in there was a bit of a mix-up on the length of our stay which Monica in the front desk staff quickly and efficiently corrected.  BTW, the front desk staff was excellent-very professional and efficient yet friendly.  

We were very close to a tube stop as well as the large Paddington station where we arrived/returned to LHR on the non stop train.  As we were on our feet sightseeing all day, that was important and we felt very safe as we walked to/from our hotel. Good restaurants were nearby plus small shops selling souvenirs and whatever else we needed.  

I would highly recommend this hotel for the location, service, and breakfast.  Definitely will stay there again!",5,2018,12,20
103,Most friendly and supportive staff that really cares,"The hotel has great location and is nicely refurbished. Rooms are very clean and overall impression is up to good standards. Want to mention great staff, from the minute i walked in i was surrounded by care and support. Special thank you to Olga from reception and Zdravko from guest relations. These people helped me with anything regarding my stay. Since I am staying in Park Grand for long period, they kindly helped me to chose the room that would be the most comfortable taking their time to show around and let me chose. This means a lot to me. Also they provided me with lots of useful information and most importantly fantastic attitude, smile and care. Amazing staff makes this hotel even better place. Kind regards

I highly recommend anyone trying to stay in London to choose this hotel, especially someone who would like to stay near Paddington station. Cosmina, who’s the staff at the reception, has been so friendly and welcoming to me and my mom. And she’s very considerate and help us to lift the luggage. Thumbs up. ",5,2018,12,16
103,"Great staff, good location, small room","I stayed for 4 nights and it was ok. Metro Station just 5 minutes walk. The check in and check out was fast and clear. Staff friendly. Wifi works fast and reliable. The buffet breakfast it is ok. Room clean and bed comfortable. Coffee and kettle available, small fridge if you need it and also microwave. Rooms are made a bit late, so if you leave early and come back around 2-3pm may be you room is not ready yet. The bad point is that the room is really small, I don’t know if this is normal in London as it was my first visit since 1998.",4,2018,12,16
103,Amazing stay,"We stayed for one night at the Park Grand Paddington Court hotel in December 2018 to enjoy the Christmas atmosphere in London

When we came back at the hotel after a long day,  our room was very nice decorated including rose petals and chocolates, which made our stay even better.

Cosmina, thank you very much for taking care of us and making our trip unforgettable!

We will come back for sure :)",5,2018,12,16
103,Amazing stay,"We opted for this hotel for being so close to winter wonderland. The hotel staff was absolutely fantastic, especially Olga the lady who assisted us with checking in. As our room weren’t quite ready yet, a complimentary coffee was given and we were kept updated. The whole staff was fantastic even carrying our bags to our room. The room itself was fantastic, every little detail was thought off. I would certainly stay again without any hestitation.",5,2018,12,16
103,Visiting London!,"This hotel gave us a great experience during our stay in London. Cosmina, a staff at the reception, provided great services to us when we needed it.

The breakfast and rooms in this hotel are also up to standard, making it a pleasant stay.",5,2018,12,15
103,"Thanks to Olga and Dario, we had a great trip!","Great hotel! Our family stayed there for a week. Thankfully Olga and Dario upgraded our room so we could get the most out of our stay, and Dario helped out when the hotel was having trouble processing the card stored in our reservation. Thanks!",5,2018,12,15
103,Tight but reasonably convenient,"The rooms are absolutely minuscule but they are upfront about it and it is what you have to expect from London, so that is fine. The hotel packs a lot of utility into the tiny rooms, so you end up not missing much except for space to move. If you are in the room, the bed is where you will be because the bed is the room.

The free wifi is based on some outdated system and did not work on my phone, only on my laptop. I was also concerned a bit that I saw some Chinese addresses when connecting to the internet - what with all the stories of personal data being sold overseas these days.

Breakfast service was very pleasant and fast, although the selection of food was rather on the low side (but still perfectly adequate).

The staff were in general very friendly and fast, except for the person who checked me in, who seemed to have trouble expressing himself. It took some back and forth before he managed to make himself clear, which left a bad first impression.

There was something strange happening with the temperature control in the rooms - it kept changing on its own! I set it to 21C in the evening and in the morning it was set to 18C. Then when I came back from work in the next evening, suddenly it was set to a tropical 27C in my room. What the?

The building layout is sometimes dangerous, which unexpected steps that can easily cause tripping if you are not watching out for them carefully.

The location is great - very close to Paddington station. If you fly in from Heathrow, this is practically in the immediate vicinity (due to Heathrow Express arriving at Paddington).",3,2018,12,15
103,Brilliant location and customer service!,"Me and my partner arrived early this morning after getting off a 25 hour flight from New Zealand hoping to store our bags until check in, we were greeted by Olga and she was brilliant! 
Not only did we get to store our bags, she said our room will be ready in an hour and through a complementary breakfast in. Time we had finished our yummy breakfast our room was ready and it had been upgraded! 
Big thanks to Olga as checking in early allowed us to freshen up and get some rest after that long flight! 

 Location is perfect as Paddington station is only a 5 minute walk away, and only took 30 minutes to get here from Heathrow. 
100% would recommend this hotel and would stay here again!
Thanks for the stay,
Polly&Luke:)",5,2018,12,13
103,"Perfect location, great hotel","This hotel is wonderfully placed with a short walk to Paddington station and also near to Queensway, Bayswater and Lancaster Gate stations. I was helpfully shown to my room with all the features pointed out and the air conditioning set to a pleasant temperature. The room seems to have been recently refurbished with chic modern bathroom fittings and luxurious bedding. I was on the bottom floor so it was a tad noisy when people clomped up the stairs to other levels. There was an elevator as well which was helpful for luggage. The accommodation is in a separate building to the reception which is directly opposite. There was a nice touch with 2 complimentary bottles of water and biscuits to welcome me. The room was also nicely maintained daily. I had a wonderful stay here and would highly recommend it. I look forward to staying here again when I next visit.",5,2018,12,12
103,Unforgettable experience,"Great location, close to Paddington, Hyde Park, and 3 subway stations. Pleasant and clean room.

103,Miss Tshiamo Lobelo-Lesolle,"Staying at Park Grand Paddington Court hotel in West London was absolutely remarkable. I’ve stayed in many hotels in the west of London and nothing can quite compare. It’s tasteful interiors, it’s duty in providing service as a hotel in itself was grand. I would like to thank all the staff for their incredible service. Especially Zdravko for making me feel right at home.",5,2018,12,12

103,Simply Perfect- location/ team/ comfort- Just great!,"The hotel is small and cosy in walking distance from Paddington Station (500 m) down the Praed Road.There are numerous small restaurants to dine in less than 1 min walk. I had a Club Room and it turned quite alright too- large bed, Handy device for personal free ise and reasonable size room.
The reception team and specially concierge ZDRAVKO were absolutely great in many ways. Always giving best advices for anything you may need in London- from regular oyster tickets to theatre and excursion bookings. Not to mention helping you  with general advices on the destination and places to visit too. Am coming back again in April or late March and surely will stay in.",5,2018,12,11
103,"Excellent service, very nice room","We wanted to stay in an other hotel of Park Grand but due to some problems we where asked to go to Paddington Court.
The people who work there are very very friendly and helpfull. Olga helped us out very good,she is a professional!!

The compact room was good (little bit to small), the club room was excellent. Nice, clean and a great bed!

We enjoyed breakfast very much.

From the hotel you are just in a few minutes at bus/underground.",5,2018,12,11

Com for stay 8 dec pay on arrival get there hotel room cancel after 150 mile travel reason being is cause apparently was meant to be payed before but not confirmation for that when we asked if they could give us a room they said no and offered to pay cash and said no we rented your room already was no help couldn't care less for people who travel 150 mile for a birthday weeekdm,1,2018,12,09
103,Very comfortable stay,"I was here for business and had great time here. Very convenient location, just 3-5 min walking distance from Paddington station and easy to access any location including the airport. I especially liked the bed. I normally have difficulty with sleeping in a hotel but no problem here. A receptionist Cosmina helped me a lot when leaving hotel. Great service and I promise to come back here again.",5,2018,12,08

Breakfast was excellent (which was included in the price)

103,Deluxe what?,"I'm not entirely certain how this hotel can confidently sell its guests deluxe double rooms, when the rooms contain two single mattresses pushed together, no bath and buzzing lights. Last night, I was confined to one side of a double bed, since it's absolutely impossible to lie in the middle of two single mattresses without feeling stabbed. I was placed in what was meant to be a quiet room at first, but instead had what I can only describe as a generator outside of my bedroom window which continued to whirr on and on until I cracked. I eventually changed rooms, only to be placed on the basement level, right next to a communal door that continued to bang all through the night. Such an unforgettable stay for all the wrong reasons. Don't be fooled by the ""deluxe"" descriptions.",2,2018,12,06
103,A WORK OF ART,"After experiencing a long night in one of their rooms, a front desk receptionist by the name of OLGA went above and beyond. Not only did this young lady switch my rooms but she did it without hesitation and acted as if it was her fault I had a bad night. This type of service goes quite a long way in this industry and it is what keeps it above the rest. This is my first time staying here, but I can assure you this will NOT be my last thanks to the overall outstanding service!!!",5,2018,12,04
103,Good service ,"We got there the first night and were disappointed with the room it was clearly a case of good angles in the pictures of the hotel because it was not the nicest room ever, I paid a large amount for a ‘club room, which was nothing short of a double room and had a useless walk in wardrobe area, the room was old and not very well looked after and just didn’t have that nice fresh hotel feel we were looking for, the bathroom was not the nicest either, we were supposed to stay two nights but ended up cancelling the second night because we found a better accommodation and it was cheaper this was the only time I’d big up the hotel because I would not have got a refund as the cancellation was so late but after some blagging I managed to get it for free so I thank the staff for that but I’d probably look elsewhere before staying here, sorry staff you tried your best but you can’t polish a turd ",3,2018,12,03
103,Mr archer,Great service by George at the main front he up graded us to a nice club room the room is nice and spacious clean and fulfilling to what we need on a nice romantic weekend away and close enough to Hyde park for winter wonderland,4,2018,11,30
103,Great hotel and amazing staff,"Visited for 2 nights , the room was clean and modern , The staff was very helpful with every thing we needed , George the receptionist and Zdravik the concierge were absolutely amazing , helpful and up to date with every situation regarding the guest ( the airline lost my suitcase and they did every thing to help and eventually personally brougt it up to my room)
I will come back to this hotel next time Im in London! ",5,2018,11,27
103,"Hard Work, Difficult and Not Worth the Money!","This hotel chain is a clearly OVERBOOKING and putting guests in any of the free rooms available in the other hotels, regardless of the POOR standard or price.  

I booked this hotel weeks before we arrived in London.  We got the train down and unfortunately we were delayed and so didn't arrive to 10.30pm.  We tried to check-in and were told that there had been water leakages and the room we were supposed to stay in was damaged and unavailable.  I questioned why no-one had contacted me to tell me this to which he responded with 'I don't know, you should have been'!  He proceeded to tell me that we would be relocated to one of their sister hotels for the same price. 

We arrived at the Park Grand Hyde Park Hotel.  This hotel was far below our expectations.  The toilet roll was the cheapest stuff you've ever seen, ouchies!, The doorway and hall in the room was extremely slim, beware knocking from side to side as you walk through.  This was apparently a 'deluxe double room' which greatly puzzled us as I would genuinely hate to see a standard.  The bed was the smallest version of double possible!  The towels in the room were again teeny tiny, along with being extremely rough.. again ouchies! We were woke up with vacuuming early on the Saturday morning above us, thank-you clearers!   To be fair though, you could pretty much hear everything, full conversations could be heard whilst in the bed of people walking past out door.  There was no bath in 'deluxe double room', single glazing window so it was rather cold when we arrived in.  Also to our joy they tested the fire alarm early on Saturday morning... I'm not sure if others might find that normal but I wasn't amused!   I spoke with the manager the next morning and expressed my concerns at being put in a poor hotel when we paid for the Grand Park Paddington Court.  After some excuses and much protesting on my side he said he would arrange for us to go back to the other hotel with an upgrade.  We arrived back to the original hotel to a receptionist who knew nothing of the return or the upgrade.  I explained that this was shocking and needed to be rectified.. they offered us a 'club room' which is apparently an upgrade.  This room was definitely better than the one the night before, however I would only call this a 'standard double'... don't be taken in by the names... you're overpaying here if you think you're getting what it says on the tin.

They are scamming customers with this hotel chain.  We watched as every guest who arrived during our flipping between both hotels were moved from place to place.  This isn't a co",1,2018,11,26
103,Ms,"Not a great experience it was four stars and I just don’t know where to begin I was so disappointed!
Tiny room but that’s to be expected I suppose in London ! Very large Victorian window which had the bed right against it and not double glazed so very cold at this time of year ! 
Heating dial waste of time because its operated by the hotel when they choose to switch on ! Under floor heating on bathroom didn’t work freezing getting out of shower! 
Quilt on bed was not adequate it was summer weight and cover didn’t fit all of the bed clothes were not fitting so very uncomfortable! 
My second night the glass cover on the dressing table can you believe fell off and shattered into glass splinters all over the floor it wasn’t attached and wrong glass for the purpose! Everything about that room was wrong for the price they charge ! I have stayed in better for half the cost ! Customer service was appalling they moved me at 11 p clock at night into a freezing cold room in the basement and I repeatedly had to phone up to get the heating on ! They eventually brought a portable heater at 12 o clock my evening relaxing ruined ! 
They have different staff coming on duty I couldn’t get through! Not acceptable would definitely not recommend have had no apology!

103,Much better hotels in London for less money,"Reading the reviews here there seems to be a couple of themes. Firstly reviewers with only one review on Trip Advisor (presumably employees) rating the hotel 5 and lying how good it is. Secondly guests booking in one hotel (we thought we were in the Park Grand Lancaster Gate and ended up in the Paddington). Staff claimed it was due to maintenance issues but I think they just overbook rooms.
We got ""upgraded"" to a Club Room. Well I would hate to see a normal room! No bath. Tiny shower. Broken bed.....
Breakfast OK but limited choice, served in a claustrophobic, sweltering basement.
For sure there are better cheaper options....for the price I expected much better.",2,2018,11,25
103,Best Hotel in the area,"I often travel in business, and whenever possible I get room in this hotel. Staff at the reception and in the restaurant are nice and helpful. Rooms neat and clean. Commute options are also very convenient.",5,2018,11,24
103,London stay,Visited London for 3 days to see the sights. This hotel was great as a base. Good location to two tube stations. Our room was across the room from the hotel but this was not a problem. The room was slightly small with thin walls but had everything you needed. The breakfast was lovely and the staff were really friendly.,5,2018,11,23
103,visit with my friends,"we just arrived in London and have no idea on where to stay due to sudden cancellation, we decided to go to Park Grand London Hotel (27 devonshire terrace). there we talked with Cosmina, she helped us to find a room with a great deal for 3 nights. she was very helpful and her customer service skill is remarkable. if you guys come by this hotel, try to find Cosmina :)",5,2018,11,22

103,Some problems that were eventually settled to my satisfaction,"I think my title says it all.  Don't want to go into any detail as things were eventually resolved. Not a romantic hotel!  Location is good, didn't find the bar or eat other than breakfast.  Hotel very busy.",3,2018,11,19
103,Amazing Hotel,"I didn't know what to expect when I first booked the Park Grand Paddington.  I normally stayed in other neighborhoods in London that I was more familiar with.  From here on out I will only stay at this hotel.  They had my room ready early, all of the hotel patrons were incredibly nice.  Particularly Kanisha at the front desk who not only recognized that it was my birthday but also had the turn down crew make my towels in the shape of a birthday cake and left the nicest birthday note.  This is not the type of service you would expect in most hotels in most major cities world wide.  To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an undersell.  Thank you so much Kanisha and the staff of the Park Grand.",5,2018,11,18
103,Beautiful Hotel and lovely staff,I came to this hotel on the 08.11.18 for an over night stay and the staff were so accommodating and friendly it was lovely to see. The hotel is lovely and room was really nice and modern. Breakfast was good and staff were also very helpful and Zdravko organised a taxi for me to the hospital and helped with my luggage. Thanks so much. I would defiantly reccomend a stay at this vibrant and friendly London hotel. Not to far from train station 6 min walk max.,5,2018,11,17
103,Excellent Customer Service,"Excellent customer service, especially Olga and Altus in the reception. They very quickly took care of all our needs. Would definitely recommend the hotel, and hopefully you have Olga and Altus serving you!!",5,2018,11,17
103,Great exprience,"Very nice room, with television, a small fridge(that we used a lot). We only used the room to sleep in, and didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, as were on to go most of the time. Nice distance to Paddington central station, and easy to find. Also great that you can rent bikes just outside the hotel.",4,2018,11,17
103,Excellent hotel and service,"I had a wonderful time at Park Grand Paddington, spacious rooms and amazing service provided by Ms. Cosmina Lupu. We came for the first time in London and she helped us plan an unforgettable city break. Thank you Ms Lupu for all the help!

103,Unbeliveable place,"Amazing hotel to stay in the heart of London.Extremely professional and helpful staff, especially Ms. Lupu, who was very kind in making our stay unforgetable and providing real insights of London authentic life.
Will definetely return to this place at our next visit.",5,2018,11,15
103,Extremely unhelpful,"I booked this hotel a day prior to arrival through a well-known booking agency, who pay for the rooms on behalf of my company.

I got to the hotel at approx. 2300hrs after a long day, only to be initially told that there was no room available and that I would have to go to another of their nearby hotels, although this was disappointing it wasn't the end of the world. As I continued to check in, I was informed by reception that although they had confirmation of the booking they would require me to pay for the room as they no longer recognised the booking agency......why was this not identified at the time of booking?

I phoned the agency to clarify the situation, who confirmed that the room had been booked and that there should be no issues, the agent spoke to the receptionist who refused to accept the booking. I subsequently had to get the agent to find me another hotel, the nearest with a room available was 20 minutes away.

While waiting to sort my debacle out, there were at least three other customers who had difficulties booking in.

The following day the booking agency clarified that the hotel room had been paid for and that the problem should not have arisen.....not much comfort after having to traipse across London.

I would think carefully about staying at this hotel.",1,2018,11,14
103,Brilliant experience,"Ended up staying in the Park Grand hotel due to unforeseen circumstances for 4 nights. What an experience! Every single person there went above and beyond to make sure that I am ok and am happy with all aspects of room, hotel, stay, etc. Special mention to Dario who was the one that met me and showed real compassion in regards to the situation that I was in. Truly irreplaceable member of staff! Luanne was brilliant as well and always willing to listen and understand. They offered me room moves, help with any bookings (for restaurants, cafes, etc.) without me even asking for it. Zdravko was also a real star. He was willing to show and explain everything he possibly could and always approached first to check up on guests. He makes amazing coffee as well! 
I will definitely recommend this place to everyone I know. Everything was perfect from start to finish.
Thank you, guys!",5,2018,11,14

103,Excellent hotel ,"We booked last minute and got a really reasonable deal on a room with breakfast. They even upgraded us for free when we got there to check in because I’d booked a twin room so they gave us a club room. Rooms were big, spacious, came equipped with all the extras and the bed was really comfortable. The breakfast selection was excellent the next morning with a really great buffet that goes on until 11am which is great for the weekend. Check out was 12pm which made us feel we didn’t have to rush. It’s a 5 min walk from several tube stations close by with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants close by. The staff were incredibly helpful from the moment we arrived with friendly and welcoming check in staff and a porter who helped carry my bags to the room. I would definitely stay again as the who stay was brilliant.",5,2018,11,04

This was my first time travelling alone and I was looking for a single room that is within my budget ans is accessible to the train station which the hotels fits perfectly.

English breakfast from the hotel was good and overall i would definitely stay again in this hotel.",4,2018,11,02

The location was nice and staff were helpful. The WIFI cut out for several hours with no explanation or time frame on when it would return. This isn´t good if you are on a business trip. Price was cheap-ish for central London. All in all, the room was good but the photos are deceptive, the room was a lot smaller than I imagined.",4,2018,10,22
103,My wonderful stay in Park Grand Paddington Court,My stay at this hotel was wonderful. 5 minutes from Paddington station and Hyde park. Clean and comfortable rooms. If you want more space then book the club room.I would like to mention about Alrich who made my stay in this hotel a memorable one. Alrich guided me booking this hotel and arranged a great accommodation for me to stay in this hotel. His cooperation and support was unique and his services were outstanding by all means. I am truly delighted throughout my stay in Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel and I will definitely returning to this hotel anytime in future I visit London and will also recommend others to stay in this hotel.,5,2018,10,21
103,Holiday,I was amazed from the service it was amazing and we will definitely think of coming back and especially there was a worker named marius he was very kind and a big professional at his job and all my requests were answered always with a smile.,5,2018,10,18
103,Grand is only the Name - not so the Rooms nor the Service,"The rooms are everything else than 'grand' but actually very small. Admittedly it is an old building and there might be bigger rooms available but we ended up with two very small rooms. They were clean and functional though. Unfortunately the staff messed up our booking which consisted of one room for 2 nights and one room for 1 night by insisting first that our booking was only for one room for 2 nights when the second party tried to check in shortly after midnight. Then the check-in staff provided us the room key to a room which was already occupied by someone else. It was rather embarrassing walking into the room with the bed already occupied. When mentioning the incident upon check-out in the morning, the manager on duty, who was actually the one who checked the second party in after midnight by allocating a room which was already occupied, was rather arrogant and unapologetic. It did not necessarily leave the best impression for any future stay.",3,2018,10,18
103,Lots of details missing...,"I stayed in the 'executive rooms' across the street for a couple of days. Rooms are pretty small, but tick the boxes. The big negative is the quality of service. In the bar almost non-existent and if there is staff they are focused on outside customers coming for high-tea. Internet fell down for a bit, which is awkward being there for business, but no qualified assistance/follow-up was offered besides the 'call us back in an hour'. By far the worst experience was the taxi service arranged by the hotel to bring me to Gatwick Airport. A haggling driver who spent half of the trip trying to get me to pay cash instead with card and the other half of the trip in a bad mood. Emails to the hotel asking for a copy of my lost receipt for the ride are so far unanswered. In short; brick and mortar up to par, service level isn't. Would not recommend this hotel for business travelers.",3,2018,10,17
103,Perfect experience,"The room is very clean and the staff is really helpfu. Special thanks to Adonia and Olha who helped me with everything. The location is perfect because is close to underground station and the Hyde park and train station as well. There are many shops and restaurants in the area so it's really good for walking around.
Next time I will come here for sure.",5,2018,10,17
103,Terrible,Took 30 mins to check in. Staff look lost. Rooms being double allocated and new guest walking into occupied rooms. No chains on doors to stop them. Don’t feel safe.  The room smells terrible. Really think twice.,1,2018,10,16
103,Terrible experience,"Unfortunately we booked to stay here for 3 nights. On check in, after a 30 minute wait at reception, we were directed to a room that was tiny, filthy and the smell of cigarette smoke was so strong I had to use my inhaler. After bringing this to receptions attention they tried to find another room, at which time we were taken to a basement room with another couple in there, lying on the bed. We were then left whilst an empty room was found, which actually turned out to be the smallest room yet, which we had heard another customer previously complain about and leave the hotel.
As a last chance effort before we checked out ourselves, we were shown a room in a different building. We accepted this room as by now it was midnight, and it appeared to be much bigger and cleaner. Only to find later the toilet was left with festering excrement (photo attached) from a previous guest.
I am absolutely disgusted by the whole episode and it completely ruined our stay. 
Having emailed our concerns to the hotel, there was no reply and we were told at check in we would not get our money back if we checked out. On top of all of the above, we were locked out of our room as the door locking system would not work, and had to ask at reception every time we wanted to get back into our room and outside our room constantly smelt of sewage.
Hotels.com kindly attempted to contact the hotel for a refund, who sadly refused. An absolute shambles from start to finish, completely ruined our trip.",1,2018,10,14
103,Managing Director,"It was a nice stay for 4 nights , Great location, Clean rooms & available house keeping orders anytime with a co-opertaive team especially Miss / Luanne Dias (Reception Manager) whom solving my booking problem in a professional way upon my arrival.",5,2018,10,10
103,Let Down,Room was pokey clean and staff were lovely. No lft to room 320 that i found and stairs tatty.  For the price i would think there is better.  Breakfast was average at best. Plumbing isnt free draining.  I can say nothing to dislike or like mediocre.,3,2018,10,10
103,Helps me a lot - great!!,"Mr. Concierge (Me.Zdravko, sorry if spells are not correct) helps me a lot for everything. Very friendly staffs and great location. I defenatelly would like to come back to this hotel !! Thank you so much for everything:)",5,2018,10,09
103,We will never stay anywhere else when visiting in London!,"We will always and forever be grateful to the lovely receptionist at the Park Grand Paddington Court hotel - Cosmina Lupu - she truly saved our weekend in London! 

Our long weekend in London didn't start out well at all - beginning with a very delayed flight, followed by the sudden information from a local UK colleague that we should definitely NOT stay in the hotel that we ORIGINALLY had booked... and ending with us having to stay in Luton the first night. 

To make a long story somewhat shorter: arriving in London after a long night at the airport and a hotel in Luton, we searched for a new hotel to stay at in the city. We found the Park Grand Paddington Court online, which had great reviews, and headed over there right away. The room for three that we had found online was unfortunately not available, the site was not up-to-date - just what I needed..! The lovely receptionist Cosmina obviously could tell that I couldn't take much more bad news and told us she would see what she could do for us. She managed to find two rooms at a good price for us and invited us for a cup of tea in the bar while we waited for our room to get ready. I already felt much better, just by her friendly smile and personal effort to make us feel comfortable. And it didn't stop at that - she personally made sure that we had a good stay there every day! We surely hope that the hotel management knows her value and makes sure she wants to stay with them for a long time! Due to Cosmina, we will come back for sure and we have also already recommend our friends to stay in this hotel.

We loved our room! It was not big (that is normal for London), but it was absolutely clean, high standard and modern - not at all what I am used to in London! Much better!

The breakfast was perfect for me - both English and continental available. I loved the smell of fresh toast coming down there - and juices, fresh fruit, yoghurt and muesli. If you ask, they even make your a fresh omelette with your choice of topping. And if anyone like the traditional English breakfast, there are plenty of sausages, bacon, eggs etc.

The hotel is only a few walking minutes away from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, great restaurants and the Paddington underground station. Walking to the big shopping street Oxford Street or to the famous Harrod's through Hyde Park doesn't take more than 20-30 minutes from the hotel, if you prefer to avoid the underground or the above ground traffic. The hotel crew is happy to give you recommendations regarding where to go, eat, shop etc.

We bought tickets for the Big Bus hop-on-hop-off and loved riding around at the top of the bus and on a boat in the sunshine - it was a good way to get a good overview of the city. There is a stop very close to the hotel.

To finalize this review: As you can tell, we are more than satisfied with our stay in this hotel - we already look forward to the next time!",5,2018,10,08
103,Sensitive to the needs of guests,"Initially my sister and I had a small room but after speaking with reception, I was able to receive an extremely comfortable room - Club Room on the ground floor of the hotel.  I had a newspaper delivered to my room every morning.  The room was cleaned immaculately.  My sister Clare was given a surprise for her birthday since I just mentioned it to the staff.  I will like to single out Ms Luanne Dias, Reception Manager who went all out to ensure that we were comfortable.  Thanks also to Olga and her team.  A very pleasant and helpful staff must be commended.  Keep up the good work",4,2018,10,08
103,good value for money,"we had a compact room for one night. very comfortable, bed was only 4 ft (1.2M) but we are not large so no problem. room included an ensuite, wardrobe, desk, tea & coffee making, bedside cabinet, TV - amazing  what you can fit in such a small space. very friendly staff, good buffet breakfast included in the price. parking not easy if you bring a car but possible in nearby car parks. not right in the centre of london - long walk / short taxi ride / tube ride to oxford street.",4,2018,10,07
103,Wonderful visit to London!,"Had an excellent visit staying at the Park Grand Paddington for my sister's 30th Birthday.  Beautiful, clean rooms (lovely bathroom and shower) even though they are on the smaller side- (I'm from Manhattan NYC, so this was GREAT!) Very friendly customer service and front desk assistance.  Perfect location- less than 10 minute walk to Hyde Park, the tube station and Notting Hill.  Visited Oxford- and was also walking distance to the Rail Station.  I highly recommend staying here- My sister and I had a very pleasant stay!",5,2018,10,07
103,Very good experience,"Me and my mom stayed in Paddington Court and we loved it! We went to celebrate my birthday and the staff, specially Cosmina Lupu, we're very nice!
The room was perfect, the breakfast excellent and the cleaning amazing!
I want to thank also Olga and Kaniska for the goodbye time!
We will return! :)",5,2018,10,07
103,"We had a week in London to look around, visit family and generally finish up what had been an extended holiday in Europe","We had stayed in the Bayswater/Lancaster Gate area before and wanted to be in a similar area as it is so handy to Kensington Park, Notting Hill, etc.  You can walk to many of the main tourist sites.  This hotel fit the bill.  Some of the aspects we really appreciated were the wonderful staff.  The full breakfast, the Smart phone which we used daily to find our way on our walking adventures.  It came in especially handy when I had to make a collect call back to Canada.  Our room was nicely appointed, quiet and if you like to sleep past when the sun come up, the curtains really block out the light.  Housekeeping were very attentive.  There is a fitness room, a nice little bar, you can get high tea, and the wait for a taxi is never more than a minute.   Would not hesitate to stay here again when we come back to London.  And London, thanks for the incredible weather for the last week of September!",5,2018,10,07
103,Mr.Ali,"Best accomodation, great location, and very very helpful staff with everything you need around the city.. reasonably price comparing to other hotels rates surrounding yhe area. Cleaness are good.. very close to Paddington station and hydr park.. overall im definitely coming back to stay here in the future.. very high recommended..",5,2018,10,07
103,Basement trouble ,"We found this hotel online and booked it due to the proximity to the tube station. When we arrived we found out that our room was across the street from the main hotel. It seems they have multiple building with multiple rooms in each. Our room was in the basement ( -1 level) . It was an odd journey to get to the room as we made our way through a number of doors and hallways until we finally got to our room. Initially it looked nice and quite spacious. I immediately saw a sofa/ pull out cot that had wood exposed at the bottom. When I went to sit on it the cushions fell right off and the thing almost fell over. It was absolutely useless. We then noticed a door to the outside which looked like a small patio which was locked. On the patio was a compressor of some sort that was quite noisy . The patio shaft went to the street level where you could hear all kinds of noise. We decided not to worry about it and left to go sightseeing. When we returned we noticed the carpet in front yo the bathroom was saturated. We called the front desk to let them know. A hotel employee came and said it was probably from housekeeping when they cleaned. I told him I did not think that was the case. The young man then said “ it’s ok, it’s no problem “ , and left. We could not wait to leave the next morning. I will definitely NOT be staying here again !",2,2018,10,04
103,Great stay! ,"I have stayed at the Park Grand Paddington for 1 week. My rooms are nice and clean. Room service is amazing, the food is delicious, the staff is super friendly and helpful. This hotel is going to be my number one choice any time I visit the UK. I leave a special thank you for Mrs. Cosmina at the front desk. She handled my stay and made sure everything matches my expectations. Prices are fair and worth it. 100% recommended for a visit to London",5,2018,10,04
103,Highlight STAFF ,"My second time at the hotel and I highly recommend. 

A big special thanks to Olga and Purbi that were extremely helpful and lovely in everything I needed !! 

Amazing to have smiling and good mood staff ready to help you when you come after a long and stressful flight .

When in London, that’s where I always recommend to my friends !

103,Excellent,"I had a great time there, room was clean with all amenities necessary, stuff was super polite, price was “reasonable” for the neighborhood, which is just great, a jewel in the heart of london!
Conveniently close to metro stations.

I would recommend it for every seeking comfort, cleanliness, friendly stuff and is willing to pay a premium.",5,2018,10,01
103,Very friendly staff!,My work colleague and I stayed here a night after delayed flights. Their friendly staff made a stressful day fade away! The rooms are what you would expect from most historic buildings in the area. I definitely recommend this place!,5,2018,10,01
103,Worst service ever,"This hotel has provided the worst service ever.
I arrived Wednesday night at 23:45 together with a colleague and simply they didn't have rooms available for both of us, despite our reservations confirmed more than one week before.
They took 1 hour only to tell us that we had to move in another hotel, that I reached at 01:30 am! 
They also invented the excuse about rooms not available because of some leakages, but the day before another receptionist confirmed that the problem was the overbooking. 
Furthermore when I asked to stay only one night instead of 2,they intimidated me asking to pay everything upfront or they had to cancel the entire reservation...at 1 am!
Unbelievable bad service
I'll never go back here",1,2018,09,28
103,Happy guest of the hotel,Thank u for the best help in this hotel the reception staff specialy Olga....Zdravko and other team I'm very happy to stay again in this hotel as I found all helpfull ..also the location is perfect because very close to Paddington station and edgwere road ,5,2018,09,28
103,Indian afternoon tea,"I came to the hotel with my Mum for the Indian afternoon tea.  It was lovely, a real treat.  The service from Kenith and Steve was excellent, they made our visit feel special.
The food was lovely and there was plenty of it.  There was a great choice of drinks too.  I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to the traditional afternoon tea.
There were not many people there, in fact the only other occupied table was a member of staff interviewing someone for a job. This did leave the atmosphere lacking a little but the service made up for it.",4,2018,09,26
103,Very Friendly and Helpful Staff,I stayed for 1 night for a business trip in the hotel and the hotel staff are very helpful especially kanisha.I had some issues with the rooms when i checked-in and kanisha helped me staright away.I am impressed with the service.I will stay here again when i return to london.,5,2018,09,25
103,Very Very Helpful Staff,Tge hotel is very good and the staff are very very very helpful espeacially kanisha.I had lost my some important things and she helped me out.I thank her for her great hospitality and the service very honest.The bell boys are also very helpful.I will definately return back.Thank you kanisha and all the staff.,5,2018,09,25
103,Never again !,"I have been travelling for several years and stayed at many different places. However I can honestly say that Park Grand Paddington would be the worst I have ever stayed in.
Don’t be sucked in by the fancy photos of the entrance and flashy reception. It is nothing like that in real life.
When we arrived we were greeted with scowls from several sales staff behind the counter all doing their utmost to make sure they didn’t have to serve us.
We booked a “Deluxe double room” but let me say if our room was a Deluxe I would hate to see the standard double. I think you would probably have to sleep standing up. 
In our Deluxe room the bed was pushed into a corner as it couldn’t fit in the room otherwise so my wife had to climb across the bed to get into it! We couldn’t open our suitcases properly as there was simply no room. 
Breakfast was served in the basement in this stuffy overheated room. Not pleasant at all. We actually didn’t bother with breakfast the next day as we couldn’t stand the thought of being down there even though we had paid for it.
The entire hotel looks like it hasn’t had any money spent on it in many years.
To sum up there are so many hotels to choose from in London and you can do so much better staying anywhere but this place.
Extremely disappointing.",1,2018,09,25
103,"Very good hotel, close to station and great staff","I stayed here for 3 nights for a business visit from Goa from 10th to 13th September. Clean rooms, good service.

103,"Comfortable, clean, and great staff!","Kanisha and Robert were so friendly and helpful when checking me in and answering any questions that I had.  Kanisha also recommended some restaurants, and printed out directions.  Andy was also so kind as he helped me bring my very heavy bags to the room. The room had everything that I need, and was in pristine condition.  The location is great, with several pubs and cafes within walking distance.  Hyde Park is very close by as well.",5,2018,09,18
103,Modern and quiet at a good price.,"This Hotel has small but nice rooms. Staff always ready to assist. I like the small kitchen, very convenient to store drinks and make a quick meal when feeling lazy to go out for a bite. Close to shops and Paddington Station, Tube and Kensington Gardens makes a great tourist location.",4,2018,09,17
103,Amazing!,"Visited as a young couple last year and returned again this year at the same time for our birthday celebrations. We had a a warm welcome from the friendly staff who, after a swiftt check-in, offered to accommodate our luggage as the room wasn’t yet ready. As with the previous year, upon being escorted to the room, we were greeted with a personal message from the management team, in addition to a kind selection of fruit and cakes, plus a bottle of wine in celebration of our birthdays (which we highly appreciated and definitely made the stay all the more enjoyable - photo from last year attached, we didn’t take one this year but arrangement was very similar). All in all, the staff were great again this year, as was the room, which was spacious and offered all that we needed. The entire room was clean as was the rest of the hotel. The hotel is in a great location both from Paddington and near by tube stations - Hyde Park is also in very close proximity. Would highly recommend staying here for all the reasons mentioned above, plus the fact that the rates are very reasonable. Will be looking to return again and also perhaps try other locations from the ‘Park Grand’ chain, as this one has certainly been perfect on both of our stays.",5,2018,09,16
103,Fantastic and Fabulous staff,"I stayed with my husband at the park grand for 4 nights and it was fabulous.The staff are exceptionally amazing and helpful.Espeacially kanisha.She has great customer service skills and good communication skills as well,she helped us with everything we need.I would recommend the hotel highly",5,2018,09,16

103,Tiniest of rooms!,"The entrance is somewhat cold looking and the Receptionist had a similar attitude: indifferent, no smile and not much of a welcome.  However the Concierge staff were must helpful and courteous. The Hotel,  obviously renovated from the original Georgian house, has a series of connecting stairways and different levels.  However our ‘Queen bedded room” was tiny; so much that one side of the bed was crammed up against the window, a tiny bedside table fittted in on the other side and the wardrobe doors just opened.  Bathroom was stocked well but also tiny.  Would like to have had some herbal teabags in the refreshment tray.  Positive side was a clean and comfortable bed; fairly good breakfast with cereals and hot options.  At £280 for the night it was somewhat overpriced.",3,2018,09,12
103,"""Compact and bijou"" pricey for what it is","Stayed here for one night recently while in the city. Booked through booking.com so simple enough.

Have previously stayed at Park Grand Lancaster Gate (just around the corner) but this was approx. £30 more for the night, assumed they would be similar so wasn't too fussed.

Arrived at midday, room not ready so they took luggage to store. When we did get room access we discovered it was in a building on the other side of the road (not ideal if you want a drink from the bar), room was very small as was the bathroom. I struggled to even think about swinging a cat, let alone actually do it.

It ticked off my trifecta of hotel requirements: free bottled water (though not in the fridge weirdly), free wifi, and plugs at both bedside tables (USB ports)

The room was clean, had the basic amenities you want (ironing board for example, though might struggle to put it up anywhere!), it was just small, even the bed felt small, not convinced it was even a UK double. 

As a crash pad for the night (as it was for us)  travelling with just one holdall it wasn't a major problem, any longer/travelling heavy would be a challenge. Feels over priced for what it is (even if you say ""it's London (for both size and cost), have stayed in markedly nicer rooms, for less money in London. In hindsight could probably have got a Premier Inn for less which would have had similar amenities but more space. 

Lancaster Gate tube is a couple of minutes walk away, so that's convenient.

Would stay here again in a pinch, but will be looking everywhere else first.",3,2018,09,12
103,Not impressed,"We booked to stay at another Park hotel and received a call to say we couldn't stay and were moved to this hotel. It was very disappointing. The first room was tiny. Settled for the third room offered. Room 145 .... you could get to it in the lift to the 1st floor and go up stairs or lift to 2nd floor then go downstairs. Lots of staff, all very helpful. Breakfast was ok but bland. Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back. This has put us off booking with Park hotels.",3,2018,09,09
103,It's amazing.,We arrived with my family and the staff kanisha is very helpful and monica too. The breakfast is very good and you have many options. The rooms are very comfortables and i was happy there. I recommend this hotel.,5,2018,09,09
103,Great location - lots of steps!,"This hotel is in a great location, walking distance to Paddington Station & Kensington Gardens. Loved the room amenities (outlets everywhere!). It's a very London hotel, in that there is no lift, and you have to be okay lugging your suitcase up and down the stairs. Not great for older people, but a lovely little hotel if convenience is your motivator!",4,2018,09,08
103,"Wonderful,Helpful and Great staff",We stayed here for a small break and I must say the hotel is very nice.The staff goes out of their way to make your stay perfect.The rooms are very clean and modern.Breakfast was very good with English and continental options.The good in the restaurant is also great.I would like to thank kanisha for making our stay great and giving us a great service.Thank you kanisha and All who looked after us during the stay.,5,2018,09,08
103,A great experience,"There's nothing like being greeted by friendly faces after a long flight. From the moment I checked in I found the desk staff to be extremely friendly and caring.  There was some confusion about my company paying for the room but the young lady at the desk went out of her way to make sure I was taken care of.  The doormen are awesome, super friendly and simply a pleasure to be around.  My favorite thing about this stay was Steve from the restaurant.  Steve was very professional and friendly and made every meal and drink some of the best I have had.  I truly enjoyed my experience at this hotel and will be back on my next business trip to London.  Thank you Park Grand staff and most importantly Steve from the restaurant / lounge.  You folks are winning, keep up the good work!",5,2018,09,07
103,Nice hotel ,"This hotel is part of a group 

We did get a small room ( compact double ) def not a double 

But when I raised this with reception the lady moved us to a larger double 

I would recommend although the hallways and corridors are maze like as it seems to be an amalgamation of houses knocked into one - it might cause issues for elderly or less able bodied ",4,2018,09,07
103,Best staff,"I stayed in Park Grand Paddington Court for a business trip un London. The stay was very comfortable and the experience was enriched by the staff members, who went out of their way and made it so comforta a special shout out to Kanisha , who was one the best ever staff members I have come across in all my visits. She makes sure of taking care of all the residents and ensures that they feel at home. I am really glad to have met her during my visit. I would recommend all visitors to London to stay here for an enriching experience. ",5,2018,09,07
103,Nice stay,"I stayed 3 nights with my 2 childeren. it was a nice stay in a pleasant neighborhood. we were received by friendly staff. the room was neat and clean. we have a good time. Hyde park was a few minutes walk away, and public transport was also close by. we used the hop on hop off bus, from where we have seen a lot of London",5,2018,09,06
103,Small and expensive ,"I really don’t know what to say about this one. It’s nice and very clean but the room was tiny, and I mean real small. No room at the end of the bed and only ~2 foot between the bed and wardrobe which was quite uncomfortable. Ideal if you’re traveling alone, but having two people in the room is a squeeze if one isn’t on the bed. 

No elevator to our floor so we had to take roughly 6 different sets of stairs at the end of each hallways. I was actually quite surprised that we made it out due to the distance we were into the hotel. If you had a couple of bags or a buggy you’d be in trouble getting to the room. 

Noisy neighbors all night, shouting and talking. Could even smell the smoke from their room coming into ours under the door and also being awoken at 5am by the room phone ringing to someone asking for another person, presumably this was the neighbors as they were all leaving their 3 doors open so they could go in and out of their rooms. And ironing in the hallway outside our door... Ugh, taking full advantage of make yourself a home...

Wouldn’t stay here again, as it’s way too over priced for the size of the room and for a hotel without a lift that services all floors.

The room was extremely small, where very limited spaces for 2 ppl’s luggage.
The most important thing is, today when we checked out, the staff forced us to write positive comments on TripAdvisor, even if we said the room was small, she pretend that she will be typing the comments that we told her, but at the end we found out that she wrote the room size was perfect!!  
Also, she has mentioned about a staff who provides a good service whose name is Kenisha, this is a fraud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We didn’t even know who is KENISHA! What a ridiculous staff, I will never come back again.",1,2018,09,02
103,VERY GOOD HOTEL,"We stayed five days and the experience was very good. The hotel is clean, the only the room is a little small and is in a very good area and very close to the metro, full breakfast. It was my brother's birthday and they had several details with us. And the hotel staff very friendly, especially Andrei was very nice and helpful.",4,2018,09,02
103,Nice Boutique Hotel,"Booked 2 double for family of 4,for 8 n. Upon arrival there was a mix up in our rooms as it was not available!!despite confirmed reservation however front disk manager offered me as a tempo as we were really tired 2 rooms which was ok,Next day upon follow-up with hotel manager and expressing there apologies we got our reserved rooms with refund and breakfast for our total stay,I do appreciate this gesture and our stay was great.Hotel is 5 min to Paddington station,And some good restaurants and convince stores near by and about 10-12 min walk to Queens Way.Breakfast was typical English breakfast with good coffee and the service staff are kind and helpful.Rooms were adequate in size and clean with small fridge(empty) for your own stockings.Bath room ok in terms of size and clean with good shower pressure(rain shower).All staff from are great and helpful.Thanks Park G P C",4,2018,09,02
103,Great experience!!!,"I loved my stay at Park Grand Paddington Court, it was clean and the staff were more than helpful. Kanisha looked after us and was extremely helpful! 5 stars, definitely a must if you’re looking for the perfect location! Zdravko really looked after us, helped us and personally made sure we was more than comfortable.",5,2018,09,02
103,Perfect stay,"I stayed in the hotel and it’s very clean,but the room size is perfect and service is very good especially by Kenisha.The breakfast was very good and when I’m in London I come back to this hotel surely",5,2018,09,02
103,Wonderful staff,I stayed with my friend in the hotel and i must say its a very beautiful hotel.The staff makes it even beautiful espeacially kanisha she has great customer service skills and guves the best service.The breakfast is very good and with variety selctions.I will definayely return very soon.,5,2018,09,02
103,Fantastic,"From day one till day 12 never had a single issue with the hotel. From a management to recipsonsit to housekeeping all was great and very hospitable with me.  
The duplex double bed 
room I had was super neat and nice, a bit small but a good size for 1-2 people. 
I would like again to thank the management team especially Valent and the recepionsists olga and Monika for making my stay great here and hooking me up with a late check out.",5,2018,09,02
103,Great stay in London!,"We had a three nights stay here! One of the best stay we had. Staff were great, especially Kanisha and Andrei! They were very accommodative and helpful. Thank you! Rooms were clean and location-wise is awesome.",5,2018,09,01
103,Compact Room,"We had prepaid for a compact room, for one night, before heading to Heathrow early next morning.
The room really was small, it was standing room only for the luggage, the double bed was against one wall, so you could only get out one side of the bed.
The bathroom was very small, the toilet almost impeded the entrance to the shower.
We also had to pay a 10 pound deposit to cover any incidentals in the room,of which there were none. The deposit was refunded when checking out, this seemed a waste of time.
The room did have tea & coffee making facilities and biscuits, a safe and air/con.
The hotel was in a handy location for Paddington Station.",3,2018,08,26
103,Nice hotel,"Friendly staff with good service especially from Cosmina.

Great service from the bell boys, very friendly and helpful. Never been a problem communicating in english. 

Had some small miscommunication with one of the receptionist, Im not sure if it was my accent or hers but defined won’t be talking to her if she is working.

Only complimentary water on first day, was hoping it was complimentary throughout the entire stay.
Otherwise good to stay, clean rooms. Efficient room service.",3,2018,08,26
103,Great value,"We use this hotel as our base whenever we visit London. The staff are really friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated in a quiet area but only 5 minutes walk from Lancaster Gate and Paddington tube stations so only 15 minutes from most places in central London.

Whilst the rooms are not the biggest they are clean and well maintained and because this is a quiet location we always get a good nights sleep.

We will be back in November for our 7th stay.",5,2018,08,26
103,Nice environment to stay. All stuff are gentle and helpful.,"This place is nearby by office. So I have choose this hotel. This hotel room is nice and big compare to other hotel. So people can think this hotel for stay.
And I take breakfast here, food quality is good.",4,2018,08,25
103,Good value for money. ,"The staff were friendly and helpful.  The room had good facilities including a microwave, however, the bed was rather small.
Clean, tidy and good value for money. 
Handy for Paddington station. 
Breakfast was a bit pricey at £15 per person.",4,2018,08,24
103,Not the best ,"Only checked out yesterday and to be honest I have stayed in better for the same price. 

Firstly they never replied to my emails via booking.com. I informed them that we would arrive early from traveling all day. On arrival one women said a room would not be ready till 2pm, however the manager corrected her in saying it would be ready in 10 minutes.  

The club room (022) that we had,  had a few issues of its own. The electricity kept flickering, the red light on the “zzz” button (to indicate “do not disturb”) was so bright you couldn’t really sleep & The shower room was so small you couldn’t really close the door without being pushed up again the sink, shower or toilet. 

The club room was located right by the access point (stairs, walk way to all other rooms, lift and close to the bar) to all areas in the hotel. This is not really a quiet room, I would of thought your club rooms would been a lot better placed. 

Walls are very thin so can hear everything... I advise you put your tv on load.

Couldn’t really take any photos of this hotel room, as my zoom didn’t go out far enough.. ",2,2018,08,24
103,Fabulous stay. Would happily stay here again.,"Just stayed here with family and both rooms we had were superb, one was in the main part of the hotel, one in the annex over the road. All the staff were knowledgeable and friendly and very professional; Purbasha on reception was especially efficient and cheery. The breakfasts were well cooked and tasty. The usual London noise from outside was minimal and the hotel is in a really nice area with plenty of eating/drinking choices nearby, and convenient for Paddington Station and/or Hyde Park. Beds were comfortable and rooms very clean. We certainly have no complaints and have stayed in far worse hotels for a lot more money. Would happily stay here again if in the area. From other reviews, I guess your view on this hotel depends on the room you are allocated and your own expectations for the price you pay.",5,2018,08,23
103,A MOUSE in room! Needs pest control! Don’t stay here - it’s too dirty!,"I found a mouse in my room. Park Grand Paddington Court needs pest control! 

I heard the mouse scuttle across my room (515) the first night, the second night I actually discovered it and nearly touched it. It’s not unreasonable to expect a clean room when your 2 night stay costs 350!

I don’t understand how a room infested with mice still cost me that! The hotel Management still expect me to pay for the second night, despite not sleeping well and being visibly shaken by the incident. 

There are plenty of other hotels to stay that are clean and don’t take their customers for granted.

Park Grand Paddington Court - for your good reviews, myself and colleagues will certainly not be staying with you again. You have failed to give due regard to the cleanliness of your hotel and welfare of your customers.",1,2018,08,23
103,Fawlty towers - beware!,"The rooms in this hotel are clean albeit small. That is not the reason for the 1 star the room was fine, you get what you pay for. 

The hotel staff and reservations staff however are completely incompetent and disorganised. It felt like an episode of fawlty towers from the moment we walked in! It would be funny if it weren’t so frustrating. 

I pre paid our 1 night stay ahead of time to make our check-in/ Check- out process more seamless as we were leaving for a flight at 6 am the next day. 
I prepaid this with the hotel central reservations via EFT as they asked and sent a remittance a fortnight ago. 

Upon check in I was asked to pay for the booking. To which I advise the above and provided documentation for. I double checked and the funds had come out of my account and had not been returned since. The staff tried to contact their central reservations team and advised they were closed and would sort this out before our check out the following morning

At check out the staff had no idea of our issue. No one had followed it up or looking into it, or left notes in the 14 hours since we arrived. 
Again they asked me to pay for the booking and I advised the above and provided documentation. The front desk attendant george was completely missing the point and not understanding my argument. He said the funds could not be located and could not advise where they would be. I asked the protocol for such procedures and he could not advise. 
They kept asking me to pay for the booking and I would conveniently be refunded my initial payment after 9 am that morning 

After more phone calls to their central reservations George advised that their accounts had an error and therefore did not receive our payment TWO weeks ago because it was sent on a weekend and I would be refunded that day. 

We had a flight to catch so had to pay and leave much to our frustration. I asked George and Praful for the name of their hotel manager to follow this up with - as due to their lack of organisation I couldn’t fathom doing this when back home as they couldn’t even investigate the issue when I was standing in the property 
They gave me a first name of their manager and could not advise his last name, work phone number or email stating they did not know. 
Completely useless and incompetent. I have no confidence this will be rectified soon and will be lodging a complaint to the hotel group. 
The customer service was atrocious and extremely unprofessional. 

If you wish to have a nice experience for your stay I strongly suggest staying elsewhere.",1,2018,08,20
103,"Good location, rooms ok and staff friendly ","Very easy to get to from Paddington station about a 10 minute walk away was able to leave my bag when I arrived in the morning which was very handy, staff are very friendly and helpful, room was ok few light bulbs not working, couple to with a little tlc as bed sheets had holes in, under the tv the planner was falling down, unfortunately didn’t sleep well due to there being a lot of noice outside my room as the bed was very close to the window and a lot of banging around early in the morning. ",3,2018,08,18
103,Best Hotel,"An amazing welcoming I had ever had in Park Grand Paddington Court London from their wonderful receptionist “Cosmina”. Can’t talk about the fast check-in, the complementaries while waiting to go to your room and the best rooms in London because there are no words to describe them. My advise to everyone to go there and ask for “Cosmina” for a good service.",5,2018,08,18
103,One night was enough,"If you’re after a base for a night, this hotel is adequate. My room was tiny, single occupancy with a single bed and it was like a shoe box - however it was clean and had everything needed, bathroom, tea coffee facility and television. 
Breakfast was very pleasant, lots of variety and all freshly cooked. 
With so much competition in London, nothing stands out about this hotel. Especially when you’re paying over £100 for one nights stay for one person - you could find better locally for that price and I probably won’t return unless I have to. 
Staff were very polite and attentive, it’s purely the standard and size of rooms that I have an issue with - the whole place needs some decorative attention also. 
If this was not a business trip, I’d have been disappointed.",3,2018,08,17
103,Room for one.,"Two nights and two breakfasts. Friendly reception staff, very helpful. Room comfortable, compact, very clean aND light. Breakfast was excellent, serice great and friendly. Papers available. Continental and full English, very yummy.
Location close to Paddington station and underground. Lovely, good area.",5,2018,08,16
103,Miss,We stayed at Paddington court for short weekend with my boyfriend.Couldn’t thank enough for all hotel staff especially Olga for such warm welcome. Our room was not ready as we arrived early morning and they offered us complimentary breakfast and put room on priority for us. Everything was great. We will be back for sure,5,2018,08,13
103,It is a great place to stay,"This lovely hotel allocated near Paddington and Hyde park.We really enjoyed our stay here.Staff amazing. Especially Dario,Olga and George.Always ready to help.Room was comfy,clean.Lots of restaurants and pubs around.",5,2018,08,13
103,Not quite hitting the mark ,"Well situated, decor is quite nice and it’s clean. 
However... we booked a Club Room and the bathroom was tiny and the bed was just a standard double. I could cope with all that if it weren’t for the service we encountered... 
Receptionists were helpful and professional but check in took ages, there was a massive queue and they couldn’t actually give us a room key initially as the machine wasn’t working. They said a member of staff would let us into our room. A porter took my wheelie case and left me to carry my holdall!? 
We stayed two nights and the room was not cleaned/made up despite us leaving the ‘please make up my room’ electronic sign on and being out most of the day. 
Breakfast was an utter shambles. Had to practically beg for coffee both mornings - and on the second morning we had to find out own cups! Food itself was good though with a decent buffet selection. 

There are much, much better places to stay than this. 
However, if you do find yourself here the Italian restaurant down the road (Bizarro) is good.",2,2018,08,13
103,Mrs,We had a lovely stay at this place. The location was most convenient and centrally located. Staff were courteous and very helpful. Initially there is a confusion at the check-in but Kanisha was very efficient and ensured we are taken care of. Recommend this place to all looking for a proximity to the famous streets of London.,5,2018,08,13
103,"Run Down, Dirty, & Spotty Service","Sooo I got booted to this place after my original hotel screwed up my booking. Upon check-in it was a little confusing as they did not know who I was. Once that got figured out and I got checked-in. I really wish I would have found another property.  In compensation for my troubles they offered me free breakfast ( I only ate it one day and honestly it was not good and I got a little sick from it)

My first room was small and a rundown dump. I know the single rooms are not that big and I have no problem with that, but the bed was broken there were stains on the walls. There were large dents in the floor I was worried I would fall through. The shower head did not work and since I was in the basement (can't believe they put clients there) I got a beautiful view of a concrete slab. But the best part is that the people upstairs from me felt like they were in my room. I could hear their every word and (due to the floors being so old) it sound like they were going to fall into my room at any time. And it had an odd smell. When I woke up I informed the ft desk (and I have no idea why they did not just give me the room in the first place) they moved me (huge hassle as I'm pretty sure they know that room is a dump) 
Second room: I was by the door where everyone goes out. Not a problem but the maids in the morning LOVE TO SLAM DOORS! The new room was nice had a better everything. It was a bit bigger which I was not expecting but helped 

Service: I wanted to extend my stay but at the same price I was told no problem. The day before I was suppose to check out I double checked to make sure I was set to stay and my rate went up 2x and I was not told of this when I asked to extend my stay. 

I really feel the people at the ft desk should let managers handle problems. I really felt I got the run around at the ft desk. You could tell who was in charge and who was not. Everyone was nice but nice can only go so far. The rooms are a little tricky and confusing. The door guys are nice, friendly, and helpful. The maids did a horrible job cleaning my room. I had the same dirty glasses and trash in my room for three days. And there were bags of trash in the hall during the day time. And the one time I did use the breakfast the dirty towels were piled half way up both sides of the elevator door. It just looked like a dirty dump. Breakfast service was poor and unorganized. I'm glad I did not have to pay for that! 

The location is nice and near bars/restaurants/transportation and Hyde Park. I would not stay with these hotel group again. I voiced my issues upon check out and he offered me a taxi to where I was going. I declined it. I felt like it was a little to late. 

If you must stay only a few days. But I would advise skipping ",3,2018,08,11
103,Excellent,"Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Park Grand.  The room had all we required, it was clean and serviced daily and all the staff at the concierge desk, reception and the office were always friendly and helpful.  The hotel is ideally located close to all forms of transport around London and has some excellent restaurants in the immediate vicinity.   The room was also very quiet and even though we were in a 'heat wave' period the airconditioning was extremely good in comparison with several other places we'd stayed that had been stiffling.

We would certainly select the Park Grand Paddington Court when we next visit London.
Diane and David, Australia",5,2018,08,09
103,Great Location,"When my husband and I visited the UK recently, we started and ended the trip in London. We chose to stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court twice because it was close to Paddington Station and had wonderful reviews. Overall, both stays were satisfactory with the second one being better than the first. The daytime staff is excellent. The front desk employees were both friendly and helpful. The housekeeping staff also tended to our room quickly and we always felt like it was clean.

A note to US travelers, the rooms are VERY small, almost too small given the price. You are paying for location with this hotel. There were only two of us and there was no room for our suitcases to open except directly on the bed. We were constantly climbing over each other, and unless you are Kate Moss you will have to suck in your stomach to get into the shower. The room size did not factor into the rating, but potential guests should be aware of this because the pictures on the website make the rooms look bigger than they are. Also, be aware that the walls are paper thin. Our first morning we woke up to the sounds of our neighbors having very loud sex. Also, when children slam the doors and run up and down the halls you can hear and feel everything. 

There were two instances that led me to rate Park Grand Paddington Court three stars. First was what occurred when we checked in. Granted, we arrived from Heathrow past midnight, and there were only two people attending the front desk. Both gentlemen welcomed us warmly, but it took twenty minutes to get us our key. Given that we were the only guests there (as well as exhausted from the flight) this seemed like an excessively long wait. There were no problems with our reservation, it just seemed like one of the employees was new/untrained and struggled to check us in. He either did not understand English, or did not understand our accents because numerous times he had to repeat himself and asked us to repeat ourselves. He seemed VERY nervous because he was constantly wringing his hands and seemed agitated. His uneasiness made us nervous. The other man who appeared to either be the manager or at least more senior of the two even asked the man checking us in if he was ""okay"". He then proceeded to leave the room and was thus unable to help the poor guy! Our booking reservation email indicated an included breakfast option, and we confirmed when we checked in that breakfast was included in our reservation, which leads to next issue we faced.

Convinced we had breakfast included, my husband and I ate at the hotel our second day there. They had a decent full English option and coffee and tea. The restaurant staff was friendly and sat us as soon as we walked in. However, we were informed only AFTER we had finished that we were going to be charged for the meal because it was not included in our room reservation. I explained that we did include it in our reservation and confirmed it with the front desk when we checked in. The hostess kindly offered to double check for us. Although, she never came back to inform us what the front desk staff told her. So, we were sitting there waiting for the verdict for twenty minutes after she disappeared. We didn't know if it would just be added to our bill or if we had to pay right then and there, so we didn't want to walk out without paying. Eventually, another waitress came over looking confused because we were clearly finished but were still sitting there. She asked if we needed more coffee, and I asked about our situation and she said that it was not included in our room and if we wanted to discuss it further we would have to talk to the front desk staff and there was nothing she could do. She seemed overly defensive considering no one came back with an update for us. We were charged 30 pounds for the two of us, which in my opinion was significantly overpriced. The food was decent, but c'mon all we had was some eggs and a few sausages. We opted not to fight the front desk staff about it, and when we came back for our second stay later that in the week we declined to add on the breakfast option and ate at some more reasonably priced restaurants less than a block away. 

I would recommend this hotel to other travelers because it was clean and the staff on the whole did a good job. I would however, advise against the breakfast option or at least double and triple check to make sure you have it before eating, and if you can find a discount deal to book your rooms, do it because we felt the rooms were a tad overpriced given their size.",3,2018,08,09
103,Absolutely exceptional!!!! ,"Excellent rooms, service and location! 

As a frequent resident at this hotel (more like a second home for me), any words I write do not justify how fabulous the hotel and the team are. 

The staff members make this hotel that extra bit special, they are always willing to assist and go above and beyond any hotel I have ever stayed it. The rooms are perfectly proportioned and equipped with everything you would need when away from home. 

Location is great, no more than a 5 minute walk from Paddington and close to so many restaurants and cafes. 

Breakfast is pretty good too. All you need really to start off your day well! 

Particular thanks to Luanne, Dario & Sonika. I don’t even need to provide my name, I walk in, greeted with a smiling team who gave memorised my name!

If I could give more then 5 stars I would!!!

Thank you again to all at Park Grand Paddington Court!

103,Very accommodating,I booked a triple room at this hotel for a weekend  as I took my adult daughter for her birthday and then another family member was joining us on the second night. When we arrived the room they gave us was definitely not a triple it was a double with a large single sofa bed squeezed into the room leaving no space to move. I complained to staff and was told couldn’t move us that night but they could for the 2nd and they did while we were out and about they moved all our stuff to a new proper triple room with 3 single beds and much spacer. Staff were very helpful and lovely we would definitely stay here again it was 3 mins walk to Paddington station where we could get anywhere by tube and train. I would definitely recommend this hotel.,4,2018,08,09
103,Need better guest relations officer,"I was assigned to this hotel because the hotel that I booked was under renovation when I arrived.  I was asked to move to Park Grand. The room was small but comfortable.  The breakfast was good and the Concierge was helpful.  However, I was assigned to a room facing the garbage area.  It was not a big deal to me and therefore, I stayed there for 3 nights without complaint.  When the Hotel send a survey and asked for comment, the guest relations officer replied I should have informed them and they would change my room.  I am not pleased because the Hotel Reception is not providing attentive service.  If you have better choice, pick another hotel.",3,2018,08,09
103,Great Stay!,"This hotel was wonderfully accommodating! Great customer service, great rooms, great beds! Our last hotel didn’t have AC; which we thought was odd, but this hotel delivered in spades. The only small gripe was the breakfast service not being included, but that’s not something I can hold against them!",4,2018,08,08
103,Veryyyyy great place to stay,"Im staying at park grand paddington and everything just so great. Especially the reception name purbi and olga. Theyre helping me lots.

103,Overnight stay in London,"Great hotel,not far from Paddington station. Staff couldn't do enough to help and went over and above by surprising me-they decorated my room as a surprise for my birthday, with banners etc provided by my sister,
I would definitely be happy to recommend this hotel and would most definitely be happy to stay here again when next visiting London",5,2018,08,05

103,"Modern, boutique hotel with accents of Victorian glamour","Staff were amazing! They were charming, helpful very professional throughout my stay. The hotel decor is bright, clean and modern with accents of Victorian glamour. The room was perfect for me: elegant, clean and comfortable. I was surprised to find a mini fridge and microwave included. Wifi was fast and easy to access. I did not eat there so cannot comment on the food but the bar is lovely with wonderful lighting. The only reason for the 4 rating (and not 5) is that this particular double room would not necessarily suit all couples as it had quite a small double bed - but perfect for me. Apparently the club room is better for couples and is larger. I would definitely visit this boutique hotel again and highly recommend it as excellent value for money and an extremely pleasant experience.",4,2018,08,04

103,Excellent friendly hotel in a great location,"Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, the location is ideal for shopping on Oxford Street and for going out on the evening for a meal and drinks as the tube station is open all night and is within walking distance.

We would definately come back and recommend to family and friends",5,2018,08,02
103,Warm welcome and great location. ,"I stayed one week in Park Grand Paddington. Easy access from the metro station (walking distance), and bus stop. Conveniently located with all major landmarks a stone-throw away ( Hyde park, Oxford Street..). Rooms are clean. Staff warm and friendly, always ready to give a hand; with the luggage for instance. Kanisha and her colleagues at the reception were very keen on helping with flight information, tours and last minute changes. Breakfast offers two options at a very decent price and good quality food (freshly-cut fruit, dairies, pastries, cereals..). The breakfast room is always kept clean and the buffet full by the  staff of the restaurant. The ladies there are also very helpful and kind. Last but not least, the neighborhood is quite lively with restaurants and cafés plus convenience stores. Overall, great place for your next escape in London. ",5,2018,08,02
103,Great stay with excellent staff,We choosed to stay at the paddington court hotel.The hotel is very good and has clean and modern rooms.The staff are excellent and especially Kanisha on reception and Zdravko on the concerige desk.Its amazing and we were here for a week.We definitely will come back again.Thank you kanisha and Zdravko especially.,5,2018,08,01

103,Perfect getaway,"Perfect location - just a short walk to Paddington station, delicious breakfast and the friendliest staff. Could not ask for more at our stay at The Devonshire. 10/10 would stay in the hotel again. Definitely a must!",5,2018,07,31
103,Great location,Great location!  Walking distance to Paddington Station.  Very friendly staff.  Gheorykl was very helpful when I left my jacket at breakfast (nice buffet breakfast btw)and didn’t realize it until much later in the day!   Gheorykl and team had it waiting for me when I asked.  Room was very clean modern a bit small but not bad at all for London.  Would definitely stay there again!,5,2018,07,29
103,Dont be fooled by the so-called ‘Rewards’ scheme,"I have stayed at this hotel (and other Shaftesbury and Park Grand) hotels over a number of years when in London on business. Not surprisingly i decided to join the Premier Club Rewards scheme to earn points for a future complementary stay. 

For the very first time, i recently decided to redeem some points for a personal visit to London. I provided 2 weeks notice of my plans and was informed that someone from Premier Club Rewards would be in contact shortly. No contact was forthcoming so i prompted them, and the response was that they were checking availability and would confirm the next day. They didn’t. After further prompting and another couple of days, i was eventually informed that there was no availability on my chosen date at any of their hotels.  

To be fair it does say in the terms and conditions that rooms are subject to availability and there are blackout dates. However the blackout dates are not published, and this fails to explain why it took a week to figure out the availability of a room in their hotels. 

My suspicion is that they actually wait until a couple of days before the date for a points redemption stay, and say yes only if they have unsold rooms. In other words, its a way of getting unsold rooms occupied (and presumably generating some revenue from drinks and meals) - not much of a loyalty scheme and not one which feels like i’m being Rewarded for anything!

Despite generally enjoying my stays at the Paddington Court over the years, this has left such a sour taste that they will not be getting my custom again. It seems their target audience is passing tourist trade rather than return business customers, so i will find a different hotel which understands my expectations. ",1,2018,07,29
103,Amazing stay,We stayed at the hotel with our family and the service was amazing that we received by Kanisha.She helped us in every detailed information needed.We will definitely come back soon.Thank you kanisha for making our stay a comfortable one.highly recommend,5,2018,07,28

I had a wonderful time was by myself on holiday to visit my girlfriend and I felt like home as such friendly staff got free upgrade and breakfast was buffet but very nice . Sonika at the reception was very welcoming and assisted with detail , later kanisha helped and concierge Andrew was helpful. Everyone was lovely. 
Very nice flower shop next to the hotel where I got my gf flowers excellent hotel. Must recommend.",5,2018,07,26

103,Highly recommend!!,"I have just had the pleasure of a two night stay at Paddington Court Executive Rooms.
The service here, beginning with the gracious Olga at reception and continuing with other reception and portering staff, was just superb, nothing was too much trouble.
The room and facilities were comfortable and absolutely spotless, and impeccably serviced.
Great location only 5 minutes from Lancaster Gate Underground and Hyde Park, and excellent value for money. I shall definitely look no further next time I visit London!",5,2018,07,24
103,24 hour layover,"Park Grand Paddington is beautiful hotel. Although I only had one night, the rooms were pristine, the staff were amazing and the ambiance did not disappoint. Both Monika and Sonika at the desk were lovely and made my birthday special. Thank you! I high recommend staying here.",5,2018,07,24
103,Solo vacation,"Park Grand Paddington Court saved me from a disastrous booking at another hotel. It was a last minute booking and to my amazement, I got a nice discount and a nice room to stay conveniently. The hotel is so accessible to transportation especially to Paddington Station, restaurants and the Hyde Park. The members of the staff are so friendly and very respectful. I would really come back here again. The room is just so perfect for a solo traveller or a couple. ",5,2018,07,24
103,Mr. Ankush,"Words cannot express how wonderful my stay has been at this hotel. I have had the most incredible time and it's because of how clean and organized the hotel has been as well as how well trained the staff here has been. I would personally like to thank Kanisha, Cosmina, Olga and of course Mr. Valent for such a great experience. They always made sure that I was comfortable and they were attentative towards every need of mine. The breakfast/food was well beyond my expectations and I had a great time using all the amenities here, including the lounge and bar area. I highly recommend everyone to stay here if they ever visit London. It would be a big mistake if you ever decide to skip on this venue. I don't think there was a day where I didn't receive a polite good morning from the entire staff and to make it even better I was offered help with anything I was doing. These are the kind of people you want to be around. They make your day so much easier and keep you happy no matter what. I would like to give a personal thanks to Kanisha for making this stay extra special. She always tried to make sure that everything was extra comfortable for me and other people. She also offered help everytime she saw me. She is the kind of person that is upper management material. Thank you very much Park Grand at Paddington Court. This is a stay I will never forget.

Regards and thank you very much,

Your ultra satisfied customer.",5,2018,07,23
103,Extremely polite and helpful,"We had an excellent stay at Park Grand Paddington Court. 10/10 All the staff were extremely polite and helpful - especially the concierge who carried our cases to our room and explained where everything was etc.  My wife and I were very impressed, please pass on our thanks to all the staff. The breakfast was perfect and tea and coffee kept on coming!
I hope we can return again and would certainly recommend staying here.
All the very best",5,2018,07,23
103,Lovely hotel!,"We enjoyed our stay very much.
We arrived earlier than check in time and was allowed to go to our room earlier which helped us to freshen up and get to a booked meal in plenty of time. 
Our room was lovely and clean and comfortable. Very convenient to get
the underground to central London.
Very helpful staff on hand.

103,Best Hotel with Fantastic staff ever,"I stayed along with my friends at the Paddington court hotel for a day as we had a re-union.The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very nice with complimentary tea coffee facilities.The best are the staff who makes the stay fantastic,kanisha helped us in all the information required as we were not really familiar with the area.She was very informative and helped us with our queries and she is very helpful and always with a smile everytime greeted us when passed by.We will definately stay at the hotel on our next visit.",5,2018,07,22
103,Fabulous customer service,Me and my boyfriend stayed for a couple of days to celebrate our anniversary.We were checked-in by kanisha who was flawless.She sent us up a cake and a handwritten card which was amazing..The hotel is close to lancaster gate and paddington stations with lots of local shops and restuarants around.We truly enjoyed our stay at the hotel..Thank you to kanisha espeacially for making our stay a memorable one.,5,2018,07,22
103,Good hotel with excellent staff,"The only negatives were that the room was small and had no real chairs; and it was a bit noisy, as it looked onto a basement corridor. But – fair enough – you get what you pay for, and we only had that room because we applied at very short notice; if we stayed there again – which we would be more than willing to do – we’d simply book a better room in advance. The room was beautifully clean and well equipped (including a fridge), and it was thoroughly and efficiently serviced every day. All credit to the staff who went to some trouble to accommodate us immediately when we felt obliged to move from a different (and completely unacceptable) hotel a short distance away. In fact, the staff were lovely: every time we appeared with luggage, a personable young man immediately took it; they seemed to go further than the norm today in wanting to be really helpful and courteous.",5,2018,07,22
103,"Loved London. Great hotel, great location.",Room was very nice. I expected it to be smaller than what we would normally find in the US  but it had all the amenities we needed. Shared it with my sister. Staff very helpful and nice. Needed to get up a flight of steps to get to our room and the staff had to lug my very heavy luggage up the steps. They were so nice and never complained! Loved the location from Paddington Station. Would definitely want to stay there again if we have chance to visit London again.,5,2018,07,21
103,Great stay,"Needed a last minute place to stay and had stayed at the Park Grand Lancaster before (very nice as well). This was perfect, convenient, cost and great atmosphere in a lovely, quiet part of the city. Staff was very friendly and helpful and hotel close to everything using public transport. Definitely recommend!",5,2018,07,21
103,Excellent perfect location,"Was only here for 2 days but the service I recieved was exceptional 
Kanisha and sonica was great at their customer service .
Rooms are very clean and modern
Breakfast was great which included in our room rate.",5,2018,07,20
103,Luxurious room!,"The staff was professional, kind, friendly and helpful!  Especially the bellmen! Loved the room decor. It was a bit of a maze to get to the rooms but that just made for a more interesting trip memory. The location was ideal for us. Yes, I would stay there again.",4,2018,07,19
103,Great location,"The room was small, but clean. The staff was genial and helpful. Only concern was that the "" restaurant"" didn't seem to exist. Although food could be ordered in a very small bar area, there seldom was anyone there to take an order for drinks or food.",4,2018,07,18
103,Great Location,"The room was small but very comfortable and very inviting, coffee, tea, cookies, water. 
Beautiful bathroom.  Staff were all very friendly and helpful, perfect location for the subway, hop on hop off, and direct transit to Heathrow Airport.  Would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,07,18
103,Good Value,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this hotel had all of the amenities you expect in a 4 star.  There are many hotels in this area that don't.  The rooms were modern, clean. Air conditioning worked,  not powerfully,  but kept the room cool.  Decent sized bed. I had a room at the back of the hotel so nice and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful.  ",4,2018,07,18
103,Excellent,Great hotel the room was lovely beautifully clean and the location is great for sightseeing around London and especially Hyde Park concerts .The staff in the hotel are fabulous Luanne and the hotel team have excellent customer service nothing is to much bother for them they are always helpful and friendly we look forward to our next trip !,5,2018,07,17
103,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, very welcoming and helpful staff. We were booked in by  Kanisha who was very pleasant, smiling and helpful.  We went for the smallest/cheapest room as we really were not going to spend any time in it other than to sleep, wash and change. It was very clean and modern with everything you needed. Would stay again and would recommend to friends.",5,2018,07,16
103,Fantastic location and service,"We stayed here for my sisters 60th Birthday on 13/7. She was in room 122 and I asked the hotel to put some 60th decorations up for me as a surprise. They did a fantastic job and also made a birthday cake shape out of a towel and fresh flowers on her bed.
The staff were lovely, the room was great & the location was perfect, just a 15 minute walk from Paddington or Hyde park & 30 mins from Oxford street. I would highly recommend this hotel. I would like to thank them for looking after us so well.",5,2018,07,16
103,Perfect location,"Booked for Hyde park festival, great location, quiet street but everything nearby. We stayed bnb, standard breakfast set up but very good quality.
I would definitely use this hotel again. Recommended.",5,2018,07,15
103,Amazing staff with excellent service,We stayed at the park grand for a short break and I must say the service is amazing.We were checked-in by Kanisha she was with all smiles and chatted with us upon check-in which usually doesn't happen in london hotels.Kanisha helped us with all the information required.Our room was ok and it was located on the ground floor.The breakfast was with a very good selection.The hotel is a few mins walk to the Paddington station.Thank you Kanisha for making our stay a memorable one.Highly recommend,5,2018,07,14
103,"Outstanding staff, location, facility","We arrived off the street unexpected and the staff welcomed us and found us a room for 2 nights. Zdnarko went above and beyond, helping me with a SIM card and getting credit for the phone.  He gave me recommendations for places to go and was simply delightful every time we interacted.  The room was clean, quiet and there were no extra charges.  We returned a week later, this time we made a reservation and were given a complimentary upgrade when we arrived.  The location is great, close to Hyde Park and Paddington as well as several tube stations.  Delicious bakery around the corner too.  From now on this is the only place I will stay in London",5,2018,07,13
103,Location Saved This Hotel,"I have actually stayed at this hotel a while back. Here’s what’s good. Ten minutes walk from Paddington station. Fives minutes to Hyde Park. Loads of bars and restaurants on the door step. Tube stations close too. 
Here’s what not so good. It’s not cheap for what you get which if your in room 108 is a tiny room at the hotel front which is very noisy. Breakfast is not worth it unless it’s in your rate I wouldn’t bother. The selection is poor and your are really crammed in bedside other folk. 
I might try elsewhere next time. The staff however are good.",3,2018,07,13
103,Great place to stay!,"We started our honeymoon here and were also celebrating my husband's birthday...the staff went above and beyond to make it special.  Every member of their team was ALWAYS kind and helpful, no matter how busy they were.  They provided great recommendations and a car service at a great fee.  Zdrauko was particularly helpful during our stay.  The rooms were comfortable, quiet and cute.  This was one of the best hotel stays we have ever had.  If we visit London again, we will definitely stay here!",5,2018,07,11
103,London Vacation,We stayed 3 nights at Park Grand Paddington Court and loved it.  The staff was super friendly and helpful especially Zdravko.  The room was really small but clean & modern.  We really appreciated the use of the handy (smart phone) while there.,5,2018,07,11
103,"Good location , friendly staff","Stayed here as it  was in walking distance to Paddington station as we were catching  a country train the next morning. On check in the staff very  friendly and helpful. A staff member accompanied us to our room and showed us where everything was and worked including a smartphone that was made available for us to use whilst there. It was connected to the internet and we were able to use google maps whilst  exploring the city. A good buffet breakfast was available and checkout was quick and simple. 
Would recommend this accommodation.",5,2018,07,10
103,Nice location near Hyde Park and Paddington Station,"Very smallish rooms with comfortable beds & nice features such as safe, microwave, mini-fridge, hair-dryer, heated bathroom floor and UK, EU & US plugs in bedroom area. Average air conditioning so it was nice that the windows also opened. Quiet neighborhood after 11pm. Convenience stores very close and an abundance of restaurants and pubs nearby.  Breakfast room was in basement as so many are in smaller hotels in London. Food was good but not fabulous. Staff was pleasant to clientele but often seemed overwhelmed & understaffed especially the maid service.
For any traveler with disability - make certain you note that in reservation request as this hotel is old and has small hallways and multiple steps, levels and elevators throughout.  Lifts do not always service the entire floor.",4,2018,07,09
103,Bad hotel staff ,"I have been in this hotel for five days, since the beginning, hotel front desk was unprepared and it seemed that they have lack of understanding how they should deal with their own customer. later on I discovered that I have to pay for everything in this hotel even drinking water if I need my room. breakfast hotel will cost you around 12 pound for a simple breakfast, you can have half of that price just to 50 meter out of the hotel, I’m wandering why..?
I think I have payed a lot of money for a very small room. it is full of A lot of furniture and things I might not use.
I can forget everything except how the hotel  employees dealt with me it was awful.",1,2018,07,09
103,The nicest hotel!,"This is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in! As soon as we arrived, we checked in and our bags got carried up to our room (we didn't lift a finger) we were greeted in our room by complemtary roses (boyfriend payed extra for my birrhday) also 2 complemtary cupcakes and a nice little note. Lovely rooms! Heated bathroom floor, king size beds! I would recommend tbis hotel to anyone! Thank you to the staff for the best visit! We will definatly be back!!! Also amazing location!! If I could rate higher than 5 then I would :)",5,2018,07,09
103,Beds not comfy,If you are particular about the comfort of the bed and the quality of linens then I would pass. I was not comfortable in the bed and the linens had a very low thread count. The room was clean and well appointed. The service was good as was the continental breakfast. 15min walk with suitcases not recommended from paddington tube station unless they are small. Many good options around this hotel as well as shopping and proximity to Hyde park. Bus system great from this location. Tube a little less convenient but still very close. The bathroom is small but normal for London. No space for cosmetics. They do provide many nice toiletries. ,3,2018,07,08
103,It's very good but... ,"Staying here after a concert at Hyde Park. Very good staff, very welcoming.
I would have given 5 but unfortunately things like not having room service (no food only drinks) after 10pm, and difficulty of staff understanding English was a frustration after a long day.
Small things matter to hotel guest... ",4,2018,07,08
103,Thanks for a wonderful vacation,"We've stayed there for 9 nights. The hotel is very well located - a few minutes to Hyde Park, about 6-8 minutes walking  to Paddington Station, close to the metro stations. Incredibly comfortable beds - soft, but good for the back. Good varied breakfast.Cleanliness in rooms.
I especially want to thank George and Olga. Largely due to them, we had a great time at this hotel.",5,2018,07,08
103,"Well located, small rooms but functional",This hotel is a five minute straight road walk to Paddington station. Our room was small with a small bathroom (only shower) but it was clean and had air con and a good shower. The hotel processes are very odd and out dated. If you buy a drink from the bar the bar person writes out a hand written receipt and has to walk with this and your money to reception to get your change. At reception they used and old fashioned credit card swipe. All of this makes service slow. ,4,2018,07,08
103,Less than pleased...,"We arrived at the Park Grand Court, checked into our room, which was quite tiny, and surprising as I reserved the club room, which was supposed to be more spacious. After inspecting a bit more and reviewing the website, we were definitely not in the advertised club room. 

When we addressed this with the front staff they tried to say it was a club room. It’s quite easy to see the difference using the website. They agreed to switch us to a more spacious room. I mean by spacious, it might be an extra foot or so, nothing really spectacular. So now, completely unpacked, we have to repack so they can move us to a more spacious room.  

They said they would send someone over with a key and to get our bags. No one came. We got our bags down to the room ourselves, but still waiting over 30 minutes before walking back across the street, asked to wait again, and then finally about an hour later, we were unpacking in the new room. Watch out for what you booked and paid for and what they’re actually giving you. 

The positives: rooms were cleaned regularly, multiple outlet sources, fairly quiet despite being on the first floor by the stairs, toiletRy items were good, and our room came with breakfast, although we only used it twice during our 6 day trip.

Room for improvement: linens and towels need to be updated-they are worn, fridge is Mildly cold at best, rooms operate with a key card and in the warmer months, it takes wayyy too long to cool the rooms upon reentry-they should give you a card to keep the AC running and a cool room available when you return after a long day, and dirty glasses were never replaced. 

If it’s a good price, I’d say stay here, quiet, clean and updated enough. It’s an average hotel. ",3,2018,07,07
103,"Great location, helpful staff","First time visiting London. It was easy to check in to the hotel, helped get my bags to my room. Staff helped with directions and suggestions for places to go in the local area.  I would stay here again when in London.  Price was very reasonable for downtown London.",5,2018,07,06
103,"clean, courteous and central","When booking a hotel is all about being comfortable with your
stay and getting value this hotel comes into its own.  A great location
close to Paddington it offers convenience without the West End price
tag.  The bathroom with the rain shower and vast tv screen provide
were impressive along with the standard of cleanliness.  Great breakfast
and the scrambled eggs done to perfection, always the sign of competent
cooking behind the scenes!  Friendly front desk and a warm welcome from
the Dan at the door.  ",5,2018,07,05
103,"Perfect, warm, welcome","We have stayed here, a couple of times, now, and as we arrived, were greeted by the usual staff. On checking in, were told as we were returning customers, that we were granted an uprade to our room. This room was situated across the road, in their other building, but this room was lovely, double, room, with sofa, and a lovely bed.....
The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Paddington Station, easy to find. along Praed Street.
As i belong to these chain of hotels, got a great price with a sale, on.",5,2018,07,04
103,A Lovely Stay,"My daughter & I stayed for 5 nights whilst visiting London on holiday & enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel is modest and very comfortable. The rooms are small but had great air conditioning which we needed in the heat wave after walking long distances most days. There is a supermarket at the door step, great restaurants, good coffee & both Paddington Stations are within 500m. A terrific stay and would recommend to others when they visit London. Very central to everything!!",5,2018,07,02
103,"Nice enough, but with a lot of niggly faults","Booked to stay in a 'standard double' at the Park Grand 14th & 15th December, but were placed in the 'annexe' across the road. This news was delivered in a friendly & polite manner by a very pleasant lady who insisted the rooms were recently refurbished & 'very comfortable', & we were given & room card & front door card. First problem was the time we had to wait to be shown to our room, gave up in the end & made our own way across, to find the second problem, 3 attempts to get the front door key card to work, a problem that persisted throughout the weekend, despite getting re-programmed a couple of times.

The room itself was tiny, the bed filled it, leaving only a foot or so either side, then a very limited area in front in which to dress, luckily my wife & I are relatively slim, anyone with a fuller figure would have seriously struggled. We immediately noticed the 'humming noise' which we tracked down to the air conditioning units on the roof outside the window, we also noticed the draught coming through the single glazed window, so quickly shut the curtains. I switched the heating on the 'full', & the bathroom underfloor heating was great, but the room itself stayed on the cooler side of comfortable.",3,2018,07,02
103,"Great location; smallish rooms, but good amenities","The downside: Room smallish, but typical for area.
Bed comfortable.  Full English breakfast with variety of other options.  
Clean.
One of best features is that they make a mobile available that's fully web enabled and allows for free international calls to many countries.  Having a web enabled phone meant no need to carry maps or guidebooks, and quick access on the run to restaurant and tourism suggestions, and hours of operation.  Availability of the phone is enough reason for me to prefer this hotel on next trip.",5,2018,07,01

I strongly  recommended this hotel

103,Park Grand Paddington Court,"Yet another trip for us to London in just a few short weeks as having to visit Harley street. So we wanted a mid price hotel. Chose this as convenient to Paddington station & price. 
A few minutes walk from the train station. 

We booked a club room as square footage was bigger than Deluxe although visually all rooms looked the same on the web. 
Paid just over £600 for 3 nights without breakfast. 
On checkout I noticed a sign saying pre-booked breakfast was only £11.95 instead of £14.95 which is good for London prices. We didn’t want breakfast as had to be out & about. 

Check in was quick & pleasant. The receptionist gave us some useful information to get to places we wanted to visit. The hotel is just 5 minutes from Hyde park. 
Set in a suburban street. 
4 star. 

Concierge took us to the room up a few steps then the lift to floor 1. Our room was next to the lift so got a bit of noise from there. He showed us how everything worked. 

We had a small complimentary bottle of red, biscuits, fruit, water & 2 cans of drink. 
This was a nice touch  & very welcome. 

There’s a fridge & microwave in the room. 
Glad of the fridge because when we visited temperatures were hitting 28/30.
Air con in room was welcome. 

Not a large room but well equipped. 

Queen size bed, white bedding with some black & silver throws & cushions. Lovely large window but looking onto the back of hotel so no views & work going on outside to a roof-we kept the curtains closed. 
Bathrobes & slippers are in a black bag on the bed & once opened the robes smelled lovely & fresh. 

Pillows are extremely hard. 

Modern tiled bathroom with a shower-very nice clean bathroom & ample toiletries. There’s also a sewing kit, toothbrushes & toothpaste, shower cap etc. 

In the room there’s a button for do not disturb. I didn’t realise this as the concierge put it on but not back off. I thought it was a night light! Complained when the next day my room wasn’t cleaned & insisted I hadn’t left a sign outside-did I feel silly when I found out the red button was ON! Doh! 
I need to apologise to the nice gentleman on the front desk for my rantings - when I returned from a long hard day of medical tests to no room service, I wasn’t happy. He apologised & kept saying if the “do not disturb” but I never let him finish or I’d of heard it was a light!! 

Room service day 3 was excellent-if only if switched the do not disturb light off on day two! 

There’s a hair dryer in the room but you need to ask for an iron & ironing board. 

We had room service on day two, delivered within 40 minutes. I had fish, chips & peas- huge fish & lots of chips. Husband had lamb & potatoes-both very nice. 

There’s a small bar area an route to the lift with a TV. Didn’t get to see the dining room. 

Staff are very friendly & polite. 
I can’t fault this hotel really.",5,2018,07,01
103,Additional charges not authorized,"In spite of having sent 3 mails asking for an answer to a complaint I presented during my check out process, in June 24th, and the promise on the counter to give an explanation to my mail during that same day I’m still waiting for it.
Clearly shows a lack of empathy with their guests.",1,2018,06,30
103,Park Grand Hotel,My stay was superior I stayed for a long time and location is great to get anywhere in London .staff were very kind and in particular ( Dario ) was very helpful complete gentleman . Clean rooms I would definitely stay there again.,5,2018,06,24
103,Would stay again,"Our flight out from Heathrow meant that we needed to stay in London the night before so location to transport links, as well as cost, was important to us. 

This hotel ticked all the boxes - it's about a 10 minute walk from Paddington Station and was good value for money considering it's location.

The wait to check in  took a long time but I'm not sure whether that was due to timing but in fairness the three receptionists were dealing with other customers.

We stayed in a compact double room and it certainly was - the double bed was more like a 3/4 bed - we were only travelling with hand luggage but there wasn't much floor space to play with! The room though was fully equipped with wardrobe space (although that was compact as well), tea/coffee making facilities, tv, hairdryer and strangely enough a microwave. The hotel also provides a mobile phone for use whilst a guest at the hotel.

The en suite shower room was also excellently equipped.

The Buffett breakfast was also very good though I'm not sure how they manage it as whilst it's not included in the price so can chose not to have breakfast there, you are just asked for your room number & name on entry.

My only (potential) criticism is that we think we left a personal belonging behind and despite leaving an email address (apparently needed for this very reason) and emailing the hotel no reply was received.

If you have any mobility issues then you should let the hotel know beforehand as I think only half the hotel is accessible by lifts. We were on the 3rd floor at the back, which wasn't  an issue for us but could be for someone with mobility issues

However saying that I would certainly go back if the need arose.",5,2018,06,23
103,"Great Service: Adjust your expectations, this is London","I stayed at this hotel, as the sister hotel i booked into had a maintenance issue and guests couldn't stay there. The issue did create problems for me, as it adjusted my timeline substantially and put me further away from public transport. However, the staff at Park Grand did everything they could to accommodate my needs, they were brilliant. I really do thank them for all of their efforts - their customer service is first class! 

I was in a deluxe single room, whilst it is small it is enough for one person. The room has been refurbished, it has a modern bathroom, comfortable bed, fridge, a phone with free calls, and tea/coffee facilities. 

The hotel gave me free breakfast for the issues related to the move. It was great. It's a continental buffet that has hot and cold options, plenty of options for vegans: beans, potatoes, mushrooms, tomato, fruits, cereal (not sure on alt. milks, i didn't have cereal), plus juice, tea and coffee. 

There are a lot of comments on the sizes of the single rooms. This is standard in London. There is a finite amount of space, so hotels make the most of it to adjust for demand. This hotel has one of the nicer rooms by far.

The only con is the way sound travels, it is an old building and rude guests may impact others. However, the staff are really accommodating, if it is an issue they will move you.",4,2018,06,23
103,Good but room for improvement,"The hotel had curb appeal and I liked the location.  Quick walk to Paddington Station and Hyde Park.  There were a few restaurants, cafes and markets near by.  The hotel is nicely decorated and the concierge staff was friendly and helpful.  It is a old building and the hallways are a bit tight and thus sound travels.  You will hear the morning rush and unfortunately the cleaning staff is quite loud.  We could hear the street traffic as the seals on the windows are shot which was not an issue as the street is not too busy and it is summer.  The reception staff and breakfast staff seemed as though they were not always sure exactly what they were supposed to be doing.  I enjoyed my stay.",3,2018,06,22
103,good hotel,"I had to stay in London nearly 10 days, hence, an attempt to choose the hotel wasn't that easy. Upon arrival I was nearly shocked that deluxe single room (based on hotel assignment by booking) was an extremely small room of the basement of compound with an extremely small bed. Well, for that price which was paid one may have a luxury room in 5* stars hotel of Italy or Germany etc. I didn’t feel comfy to stay in that room for 9 nights so had to pay some extras to get an upgrade. This is main disadvantage when to comment on. I think the description should be written more precise regarding the room category. 
As I’m lactose intolerant person the kitchen agreed to provide me with some goat cheese and porige or soya drink. Thanks for that. Even though all of them tried to do their job, Special gratitude I would like to express to Christina (service staff for breakfast). She tried her best to offer a very good comfy service. And to Dan (service staff) who was always polite and very helpful. 
The only what i really would recommend to improve to management is the quality of staff at the bar. Once having a dinner after a long day, had to come to some debates with a chef of the kitchen as they cooked a wrong meal but he and waiter tried even to put blame on me. I think it’s not a quality of 4* stars hotel. 
Rest was all good. Room was quite clean, location suited me well.",4,2018,06,21
103,Rayan,"Room was small ( the vast majority rooms in London are small too ) , the staff were friendly and happy to help you with big smiles, located in good spot near to Lancaster metro and Hyde park 3 min away by feat , supermarket and pharmacy just next door, rooms clean and comfortable beds, if I will visit London again I will consider coming back here.",3,2018,06,20
103,Immaculate hotel in a great area,"These guys went over and above for us, the rooms were immaculate, the service impeccable and the hotel was definitely 5 Star. Close to everything in London and in a great area the best place by far to stay.",5,2018,06,19
103,Good location and clean room.,"Location is good, room is clean, transportation is convenient.  Lastly, reception staff were friendly and helpful especially Luanne.  She was very professional and made us very comfortable talking to her.  Always similing to the guests and willing to help.

Thank you so much Luanne",4,2018,06,19
103,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel, very close to Paddington station and good base when visiting London.

Clean room and bathroom. There did not seem to be much storage space, but my partner noticed drawers under the bed the day before we left!

Good breakfast with lots of options. Staff were friendly and welcoming.",4,2018,06,16
103,Shame for this price ,"The place is perfectly located.  People on reception were extremely friendly and efficient.  Internet is free with good speed.  The hotel is very clean.  
Now the disadvantages:
Dramatically small room- my room was 2,5m/1,5m plus the corridor.  In Europe prison is bigger.  Bathroom is tiny as well.  Absolutely uncomfortable.
Mini bar is empty.
My room was facing ugly backyard.  I was feeling like sleeping in the basement.
Towels were old and thin.  A 2 star hotel will accept it, but not 4 star.
At the lobby there are tables and a bar.  For 2 days in a row we had meetings there and nobody tried to serve something.
Upon arrival there is one bottle of water in the room free of charge.  Since there is no minibar this should be every day.  I believe it is affordable for the price of 175 Euro/night.
Not sure if I am ready to pay the price again.  Not for this size of the room,  more precisely for this box.",3,2018,06,15
103,The amazing place,"Thank you for making my husbands bday so amazing without notice! Definitely coming back next time in London! Breakfast was amazing and staff went above and beyond! And location next to great restaurants and Hyde park..... Thank you :):):)
",5,2018,06,14
103,Always a joy!,"It was a joy to be back at the hotel, and the room looked the same. 
A few hick ups before arrival regarding confirmation of booking, but it turned out fine.
Staff always smiling and friendly, makes you feel welcome.
Looking forward to my next stay.",4,2018,06,12
103,"Very small rooms, but great location","The room we stayed in was small. And when I say small, I mean that the space between the bed and the wall across it was about 20 cm...and the bed was in the middle of the room! Furthermore, the bed was small for 2 people and the matress was just bad.

However, the room was very clean, the bathroom decent, and the staff friendly.

Moreover, the location was very good, a few min. walk to Paddington metro station and close to a pharmacy, shops with drinks/snacks, and small restaurants.",3,2018,06,11
103,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,"I definitely recommend this elegant hotel, I have never stayed in London before and this was a last minute thing for me and my partner to decide the only night before whether we were going to book and we came the following afternoon! I rate this so much that I was so sad to depart from such a luxury room and we were treated like we were royal or something! Many thanks to all at park grand Paddington court! My heart goes out to this wonderful place 😍 love from room 502",5,2018,06,11
103,Stylish comfortable hotel in the park area of central London,I stayed at Park Grand Paddington Court for one night. The accommodation exceeded my expectations. The location is excellent - just a few minutes walk to two Underground Stations (Paddington and Lancaster Gate). The room with a designer interior has a comfortable bed and good sound insulation. The staff is very attentive and hospitable. I booked a single room but got an upgrade to double room for free. I like this hotel very much.,5,2018,06,08
103,Summer holiday,This hotel is a great place to stay. Every service they have are high quality. Rooms for two guests are nice and clean. Big plus is the friendly staff. Location is the best. It is close 400m from Paddington station and Lancaster gate station. Also 3min walk to the beautiful Kensington park.,5,2018,06,08
103,after an initial confusion with the booking they upgraded our room.,"The room was good,the staff were most helpful and everyone made us welcome!
We would happily stay there again.A good/ safe part of London.

The staff happily delivered our luggage to the room and carried it down when we were leaving.",4,2018,06,07

103,Indian afternoon Tea,"Went here a few days ago for Indian (vegetarian) afternoon tea. 
The tea itself with all the bits/selections was lovely. The staff was very helpful. They cater for all dietry requirements including gluten and nuts, just let them know at time of booking. The only one point is that the seating could be a nicer, we had to watch numerous guests walking in/out which was a distraction and so gets 3 stars for ambience. 
Worth a vist but would not return mainly for the ambience.",3,2018,06,04
103,Nice place for short stay.,"My daughter and I stayed at Park Grand Paddington Court four nights.  Overall we had a nice stay.   I chose this hotel because it is near Paddington station and we needed the convenience of proximity to the hotel to travel outside Central London by train several times  

There is no grand lobby, but the hotel offers a cozy feel.  Our twin room was very small, but it offered enough comfort to enjoy the time we spent in the room, and it was spotlessly clean.  We were glad there was a window with street view so that we did not feel so confined in the small space.   My bed was comfortable, but my daughter's mattress had a spring coil sticking her back.  She slept in reverse feet to the headboard to avoid the protruding coil.  

The bathroom was a fair size, not exceedingly spacious, but big enough to move around without feeling cramped.   Rooms are remodeled and offer nice conveniences like an electric outlet for US plug and a cell phone with data for guests who need local cell phone service.  The room was cleaned every day and towels and bath amenities replenished.  The room welcomes guests with bottled water, coffee, tea, and cookies in the room.  Our reservation included a very well stocked full English breakfast daily that we had the opportunity to enjoy two mornings out of the four days we stayed.  It was quite good.  

The only disappointment was service at the front desk.  I asked if we could request a breakfast grab bag to take on the two days when we had to leave the hotel before breakfast was served at 7 a.m. for day trips outside the city.  One day I asked the night before.  The person at the reception desk explained that it was too late to request breakfast the next morning, but for the following day they would accommodate my request.  I understood, and the following day I again stopped by the front desk earlier and asked to make a note so that they would have some breakfast items that I could take on the train since I had a very early journey.  They assured me they would let the kitchen know.  But the person at the front desk did not make any notes and as I suspected, no one relayed my request to the kitchen in any organized way.  Just as I thought, the next morning there was no breakfast ready.  They quickly dispatched someone in the kitchen to go to another hotel nearby to pick something up for us.  If I had known they would be so disorganized I would not have even asked because I did not have the time to wait.  The man who left to get our breakfast was taking so long coming back that we had to leave with nothing or we would have missed our train.  It would have been better if they had told us from the beginning that they do not have a system in place to provide this service.  So two days out of the four days that we had breakfast included in our reservation we got nothing.  Breakfast isn't served until 7:30 a.m. on weekends.  This means that if guests plan on touring outside the city and must catch an early train this schedule is inconvenient, and you probably should save the money and not pay for breakfast to be included.  It would have been nice if the hotel had been more expedient in accommodating our request with a breakfast grab bag at least.  They promised they would, but in the morning the kitchen staff knew nothing of it.

I must say that overall I enjoyed staying at this hotel, and will consider staying here again if the price is right.",4,2018,06,03
103,"Spotless hotel, modern details, exceptionally good service, central location.","I travel every week for work and have stayed in countless hotels around the world and the Park Grand, Paddington Court stands out as having exceptional service.  The hotel is excellent and well located, but the service is what will make you enjoy your stay and want to return.  For example, I forgot my charger in the hotel so I emailed the manager and they were able to find it and mail it back to me right away.  When I arrived, they assisted me with my bags and explained the room amenities.  Everyone that I interacted with had a genuine positive attitude and not a fake customer service smile - there are actually upbeat, happy people working here and it enhances your stay.  I would definitely return.",5,2018,06,02
103,Park Grand Paddington Court is wonderful,"The hotel is very central to everything. It is situated less than a 10min walk to both Padding station/tube and Lancaster Gate tube station and is also only 7 mins away from Hyde park. The hotel it's self is very clean, comfortable and stylish. The staff at the hotel are out of this world; they are friendly and attentive without being intrusive. They went out of their way to make my stay memorable without being asked making me want to stay with them again soon,",5,2018,06,02
103,Great stay,"Very pleased with my 3 night stay.
Great,friendly and helpfull staff.
Accomodation in Club room was top class.
Very clean and well serviced.
Perfect location in Paddington withaccess to station,tube and Hyde Park.",5,2018,06,01
103,Excellent service,"I work in the travel industry and have stayed at so many hotels. I know what’s good what’s not very good.
We arrived at the hotel at 7:30 AM. Early!!
The official check in time at the hotel is 1 pm.
So there weren’t any of the same type of room that we booked ready. Olga the front desk lady said that she would put us on the priority list and as soon as someone checks out, she would ask the cleaning people to clean the room and then we can check in.
We went to have breakfast down stairs. Around 10 AM we went back to the front desk thinking it would not be ready.
Olga had this big smile and said that it was ready!!
We were so grateful.
We stayed there for 4 nights in the club twin room. Hotel staff was always helpful and friendly.
The room was not big but big enough and designed well. Small refrigerator and microwave were really nice. Welcome wine , soda and fruits were nice touch. Location was excellent.
Only one thing is it will be nice if they can provide us one extra suits case stand for my daughter’s suits case. ( 2 suits case stand for twin bed room makes sense.) 
We will stay here again next time we visit London.",5,2018,05,31
103,Smallest room ever,"My room was horrible! The bad is small, the bathroom is even smaller, I almost didn't have space to all my belongings. Probably the smallest room I've ever stayed in a hotel. The noise near the room was also terrible! The breakfast is acceptable. The gym is a shame, so small... The rates are not that clearin the hotel's website, and they didn't answer my phone calls. It was an awfull experience to not repeat!!!!",1,2018,05,31
103,Great hotel for business and tourism alike,"Finding a decent and reasonably priced accommodation in London was always a problem for me even back in the day when I was still employed in London and had to find hotels for my colleagues. So when time came to planning a trip to London for myself I have scanned a ton of offers on booking, airbnb and others and when I have stumbled on Grand Park which offered a single room at around 130 at the time I thought great value. The hotel has exceeded my expectations. Not only great value, but quality as well. First I would like to express my gratitude to the staff, they were all very welcoming, friendly and professional!
But lets get into specifics. First of all this hotel is really close to Paddington train station (I'd say about five minutes leisurely walk) so if you are arriving at Heathrow and travelling lite this is a place to consider. The trains from Heathrow arrive pretty much to this hotel's doorstep.
The hotel itself is housed in an old building, however on the inside it turned out to be surprisingly trendy and new owing to the recent renovation. The room I had also had new furniture and was nice and clean (I have specifically checked the surfaces usually left out by the maids, they were dust free). 
The decor was pretty much what you see in stock photos so you do actually get what you pay for. My room had a double bed queen size I think. It was neither too soft or too hard which is the way I like it quite frankly. The bathrobes deserve a special mention. They were the softest and fluffiest bathrobes I have ever seen in a hotel, so much so that for the first time in my life I have considered stealing hotel property (I haven't though).
Each room apparently comes with a mobile phone that you can use outside of the hotel for internet and calls to selected countries (UK included obviously). If I am not mistaken these are free of charge so this is a REALLY useful and innovative perk. 
In your room you will also find a small fridge, microwave, some free soft drinks, fruit and a couple of bottles of water among other perks. There is no minibar per se, but then again you are free to stock your fridge from a plethora of small shops around the hotel. The room had a really good air conditioning as well as heated floors in the bathroom so keeping things frosty or toasty was no problem. The bathroom had pretty much everything you need, including a rather spacious bathtub, actually bigger than the one I have at home. More importantly, I never had any issues with hot water which is a problem in some London hotels apparently. Also I just have to say this, the bathroom came with the biggest selection of freebies than most other hotels I've been to. Shaving kit, dental kit, vanity kit, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel. Everything was actually pretty good quality. Some of the more expensive hotels I've been to had much less.
The window of my hotel overlooked a tiny internal courtyard, but, aside from a lack of view, it turned out to be a blessing. The loudest noise I had heard coming from the outside was the occasional cooing of a pigeon on a window ledge. It was really quiet.
There was also a small exercise room in the hotel that had a selection of free weights, two treadmills and an exercise bike. Although probably not enough for fitness aficionados it was still plenty for a quick workout. 
The hotel serves a pretty nice breakfast that is cheaper if you pre-book it.
OK, now to some hiccups because this review is getting a little bit long. Frankly there weren't that many things that I have disliked but I'll include a few so that you don't get your hopes way too high.
1. The pillows were quite hard. Although this is just the way I like it some people might find it uncomfortable. Better ask the hotel in advance for softer pillows, I am sure they might work something out.
2. The breakfast selection was geared towards English breakfast. Lots of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and beans, all very delicious, but other selections seemed rather limited. So if you are vegan or muslim once again better ask the hotel in advance. On the other hand there is an a la carte menu in the cafe with a great selection of dishes also reasonably priced with hearty portions so you just might head there straight away.
3. My bathroom was kind of on the small side. It was fine for me, but people with bigger frames might find in a tad awkward. 

All in all I had a fantastic stay and I have really enjoyed the hotel and its location. I used to live near Bayswater which is close by so it was a bit of a trip down memory lane for me. It is not as lively as it used to be but it is worth going down there for a coffee or a meal, plenty of venues there. Also I was quite amazed to find a lot of American tourists there for some reason. The hotel had a nice comfortable feel which made coming back to my room feel like coming back home. Whatever snag it had I am willing to overlook it because otherwise it is just really good. I would definitely come back again with pleasure",5,2018,05,31
103,Great staff and location,"great location close to sites and restaurants, good breakfast, good room, comfortable bed, check in was awesome with alrich.  The free phone was really handy!  Stayed 4 nights, and wish could have stayed longer. Definitely would recommend. Staff were really accommodating.",5,2018,05,28
103,Good value and location,I always stay here when I'm in London as it's consistently good value. Very well located for multiple tube stations. Good breakfast. The rooms are small but that's what you get everywhere in central london. Definitely recomend ,4,2018,05,27
103,"Clean, near Paddington Station",This is a very nice hotel with very accommodating staff.  Everything was kept immaculately clean. The breakfast was very tasty!  Located a short walk from the Paddington Station.  I would stay again.  The concierge was most helpful in helping us plan our tourist day in London.  He also advised us the best way to navigate by the tube system.  ,4,2018,05,27
103,Base for trip to Buckingham Palace ,"Had booked an air bnb in same road which was awful. So a walking in booking.
The hotel could not do enough for us .excellent breakfast, spotless clean room.

103,Lovely Hotel & Great Location ,"We recently stayed at the hotel, on arrival we were greeted by a receptionist who was very friendly & quickly got us checked in, we were then shown to our Room 415, the hotel looked extremely lovely. When we arrived at our room the butler explained where things were & if we needed anything then we were just to contact reception.  Our room was extremely modern & well presented, with tea & coffee facilities, fridge, microwave & large tv, the bathroom had a shower (which had both a fixed & removable shower heads). The room was extremely narrow but had everything & more than we needed. We had a very good nights sleep. Breakfast was self service & had everything from cooked breakfast, danishes, cereals to ham, cheese & Yogurts. Paddington Station is only about a 5 minute walk & the same to Hyde Park. We would definitely stay here again. ",4,2018,05,24
103,Highly Recommend,"I stay at this hotel on a regular basis and highly recommend to anyone looking for a hotel in Central London. 
The staff are fantastic and make you feel at home from the minute you arrive until you leave.
The hotel is ideally located for Central London and only 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station.",5,2018,05,24
103,Very Impressed,"I always travel to London and I try different hotels.. this stay was exceptional.. very clean hotel, friendly staff, smiley faces, and great breakfast buffet .. not one comment .. everything was absolutely perfect",5,2018,05,23
103,"Small room, but okay","I booked a ""Deluxe single"", which turned out to be a very small room even considering normal expectations about London hotels. It was perfectly comfortable with adequate amenities, just comically small. The building is a bit maze-like, not being originally built as a hotel, and there was no signage in the lobby to point me to the correct direction. But I managed to find my room anyway. It was okay for a short weekend trip, but there wasn't anything that would really tempt me to book this hotel again.",3,2018,05,23
103,Amazing,We had a superb stay in your beautiful hotel. Thank you to all your fabulous staff and to you for organising this for us as part of a valentines prize won on facebook. It was a beautiful room and we had a fantastic stay.,5,2018,05,21
103,Customer Service,"fabulous customer service especially from a young lady called Luanne - Duty Manager is looking into a Corporate Rate for my company -  nothing was too much trouble, Rooms are great very clean & Tidy breakfast is also very good  ",5,2018,05,14
103,"Good area, small beds","Close to the nearest tube station. Very calm area. Rooms have AC, which was good. However, the normal double room is more a single room. Super small rooms and the bed is like a 120cm bed, which is too small for two adults. ",3,2018,05,12
103,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights. We checked in with a lovely receptionist named Luanne. This girl was so helpful & helped us during our stay so much with travelling around London. She was very attentive & even came to speak to us when she came into the breakfast room one morning. The room was excellent not too small but not large but more than adequate. We stayed in a room over the road & just crossed the narrow road to go for breakfast which was not a problem. The porters would help you to your room & on checking out as soon as we opened the front door they were there to help carry your luggage across the road. The room had a microwave & a fridge. On checking in we had complimentary fruit & a bottle of red wine with 2 wine glasses. The room also had the usual tea, coffee & biscuits & plenty of toiletries. The room was spotlessly clean. The hotel is very close to Paddington rail & tube station.  We will certainly return next time we visit London.",5,2018,05,09

103,Solo Travel Sightseeing Trip,"Lovely single room, comfortable bed and linens, great shower, good breakfast, friendly staff
Convenient location to Paddington Station.  The Mobile phone was a life saver for my sighting tour.
I would definitely stay again",5,2018,05,07
103,Perfect place to stay,"Great location, very clean and very friendly. Just a very short walk away from Paddigton, shops, pubs and cafès on the way. Very clean and quiet. Everybody was very helpful and we really felt home. Thanks.",5,2018,05,06
103,Perfect for a weekend getaway!,"We visited Park Grand Paddington Court for a long weekend. Coming from Germany, this meant that we arrived and left in the early hours due to flight timings, which the hotel was very accommodating of- check-in and check-out were available 24/7, which was very convenient. The staff were also very supportive when it came to arranging transport to the airport at such an early hour (before tube services started for the day)- they recommended a good solution and even booked our taxi and coach connections for us! On that topic, although the location of the hotel is excellent, it is complicated trying to get from Gatwick Airport to Paddington (would recommend saving the hassle and flying to Heathrow instead, as there is a direct connection).
We had a deluxe double room, and were very happy with the cleanliness and appearance of the facilities. The room was relatively small, but more than sufficient for a city break! The bed was large (took up most of the room!) and comfortable, our room was dark and quiet at night so we slept very well, the mini fridge, microwave and tea making facilities were a nice touch, as were the complimentary drinks and snacks provided (a bottle of wine, fruit bowl, two birthday cupcakes, and more!) The bathroom was also small, but clean and modern with decent water pressure in the shower. The complimentary smart phone was a great idea, although ours unfortunately didn't work.
Breakfast costs an extra 15 Pounds, so we decided to venture out and try local cafes instead, which worked well.
All in all, I would highly recommend the hotel for a comfortable and enjoyable city break! Lovely staff, central location and very reasonably priced for London- I would definitely return!",4,2018,05,03
103,Relaxing,"We stayed here as a layover before we headed out of town.  We wanted to experience another part of London.  

The check in process was easy, and the assistance that was provided to our room was very nice.

All the amenities that was provided was top notch.  

We loved the area to which the hotel was located.  It was overall just very nice.  

This is not a negative but it would have been nice to be able to take the cell phone out of the room to use as a hot spot when we toured Paddington and the surrounding area's.  

Upon us visiting London again, this ranks on one of the places we would like to stay again...

Cheers!",5,2018,05,02
103,"First, last, worst","So I check in for a night. I thought it odd that upon check in the gal at the desk asked if I wanted to stay in the main hotel or the one across the street. ""What's the difference"", I inquired?
""The newer redone rooms are across the street, but you must come back here for breakfast""
""Ok, I'll try it""

I go across the street, in a hurry to get changed for my meeting. 
I was in room #556. It is a dungeon, below ground, next to the elevator!?

I had to run to my meetings but came back later and said to the person at the desk at building 1, ""is this the worst room in the entire hotel?""
""Yes"", came the reply.
I was stunned. ""Did you just say, ""Yes, this is the worst room in the hotel?!?""
""Yes""
""Do you mind telling me if the hotel is full?""
""It is not""

Alrighty then. By their definition this was the worst hotel room. I didn't have time into change. But I despise hotels that try to intentionally foist the worst room on a guest. But the best part? I forgot to write a review...until the below email came in asking for a review! Magnificent timing.

103,Such a cozy hotel,The front desk was helpful and polite upon check-in. The bell hop assisted us to our room and explained all of our nice amenities that came with the room. This was a great value for the amount we paid for the room. Our room with 2 double beds was extremely spacious and cozy for 3 people. We had afternoon tea in the lounge which was wonderful. We left early the next morning so we did not have the breakfast. I wish we could have stayed longer.,5,2018,05,01
103,Amazing stay! ,"I stayed 4 nights at this hotel with my boyfriend and everybody I there did his best to make our stay perfect. They were very attentive, they changed our room with a better one on the top floor (without asking!) and they even offered us a bottle of Prosecco when we had an Indian afternoon tea, to celebrate our anniversary! Every single person working there was really helpful and always at our disposal, but our special thanks go to Luanne and Alisa. They were gorgeously kind and they really made our holiday fantastic. Last but not least their English breakfast is really good! Thanks a lot. If we come to London again, we’ll definitely come back there. It was such a great stay!",5,2018,05,01
103,Park Grand Paddington Court,"I had a wonderful four night stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court. It was my first visit to London and the Park Grand provided me everything I needed at a practical price. I loved starting my day with the continental breakfast and found the staff to be very attentive and kind. The hotel is easily accessible via public transit and in a quiet safe neighborhood. As a US traveler, I found the outlet converter in the room to be useful for charging my electronics. The room was just the size I needed - not overly large, and well laid out. Each room has a cell phone you can take with you throughout the day to use at no charge - a really unique service and helpful for international travel. Have absolutely no complaints! Keep up the great service!",4,2018,04,30
103,Very comfy stay. ,"The Hotel is in an ideal location, very clean and has a boutique feel to it. My family and I stayed in the Deluxe Triple Room and the bed was very comfortable, one of the best mattresses ever. There was a smaller bed for my toddler, desk, TV, microwave, they even provided a smart phone with internet which was free to use until checkout! 
We had a wonderful time and all the staff were extremely nice and helpful. 
The only downside is that our room was not cleaned during the duration of our stay, no towel changes, no vacuum cleaning and no bed made which was odd. 
However I would definitely stay here again in s heartbeat. 

",4,2018,04,29
103,Walk sideways,"The staff are great, the rooms are crap. Small, cramped and very hard to get bags into. The location is good but that's it. Search hard for somewhere else. 
Basic breakfast, small area to have breakfast. Room service is ordinary food, you probably can cook better at home. Bottle of water left in rooms now and again.
I certainly won't be staying here again. ",1,2018,04,29
103,Quiet Location ... undersized rooms.. lovely staff,"Well this hotel was a total disappintment for us.  There are two Paddington hotels on the same pavement.. the paddington court hotel and the Grand Paddington.  We were booked in the first one and the room was not only claustrofobic but tatty as this hotel desperately needs renovation.  We requested a check out as I couldn’t bare sleeping there another night and the hotel staff graciously did their best to transfer me to their sister hotel the Grand Paddington which was a little better thanks to the small upgrade to an executive room where we stayed for the remaining of our visit.  The rooms in general are all very small in size 12-16 msq and definitely had nothing to do with the picture shown when doing our reservation in booking.com.  We felt not only disappointed but totally misl led which the hotel blamed booking.com for posting the picture of their suite as a deluxe room.  Either way our definition of deluxe is mikes away from what we got!  To add something a little more positive I would say the hotel is located in a quiet area in Hyde Park and walking distance of aprox 5 minutes to the metro and bus stop that connects you wherever you want to go.  The staff were all very nice and truly did their best to accommodate us as best as they could.  Perhaps on my next visit I would consider staying more in St. James area as it is closer to everything yet not in the middle of the hussle.  In all fairness to the Grand Paddington Hotel, price of the room was reasonable for London but accommodation space does not compensate it for me.  Happy stay.",3,2018,04,29
103,"Tiny, I mean TINY room","If you need some space, do not book here. The ‘deluxe’ single rooms are too small and definitely not value for money. As soon as I had to descend the stairs to the basement, passing kitchen doors, staff with arms full of plates, and noticed how room doors are rather close to each other, I knew I had the short end of the stick and I was not surprised to find I couldn’t swing a cat. 
I asked to upgrade my room (happy to pay the difference) but it was, unfortunately for me, full. They did move me to a ‘larger’ single but still much to small for the average human. In all honesty, I had to check out and not stay the night because I could endure the size of the room, even for one night. Added to which the draft for the window would have given me chillblains
The hotel was clean and presentable and close to paddington station. The staff were accommodating and quick, although when I was leaving (having only checked in 20mins earlier) the lady at reception didn’t seem to give a sh1t that a disappointed customer was willing to forego the money paid, rather than stay at the hotel.",1,2018,04,28
103,"Convenient, Friendly Service","I was in London for a quick meeting, and needed to get in and out of the city quickly.  So Paddington became a natural choice.  Park Grand Paddington Court was located just a short walk away from Paddington Station.  It was also a short walk to Hyde Park and Notting Hill.  There were quite a few good restaurants around.

The exterior of the hotel was very quaint.  As with any hotel that links several older buildings together, getting to the room involved a bit of twists and turns.  The room was small but functional and clean.  The design of the bathroom was a bit awkward but very little one could do with that size.

The service was very friendly and efficient.

I enjoyed my stay at the hotel.",4,2018,04,28
103,Basement room next to kitchen,"Our original booking was at the Grand Royale London Hyde Park. Due to issues with the water there, we were transferred to the Park Grand Paddington Court. The hotel arranged and paid for a taxi.

Our room was small, in the basement, with little natural light, next to the kitchen (with breakfast preparation waking us up very early). The sink leaked, leaving the towels stored underneath damp.

The restaurant was full, so we were unable to be get breakfast.",1,2018,04,26
103,Comfortable & Friendly ,"My husband and I stayed here for he night when enjoying a weekend in the capital. From arrival the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our newly refurbished room was comfortable, lovely big bed and a new bathroom. 
I’m sorry I didn’t catch his name but the lovely man of the concierge was great, always helpful with local information and never stopped smiling. 
The location of this hotel was perfect for us and we had a great stay, we would definitely recommend and will return. ",5,2018,04,24
103,"Very nice hotel, located in nice area","Very nice room. It was very clean and quiet and had all basic facilities like tv, wifi, hot water, refrigerator, water boiler, tea, instant coffee, safe, comfortable bed. I'd  just like the room to be a little bigger. 
The staff was very friendly. 
The hotel is located in very convenient area, near a lot of stations (train, tube), shops, Hyde Park.
I recommend it if you want a hotel in the center!",5,2018,04,24
103,If there was only sound proof ,"The hotel is within walking distance from paddington station and many shops restaurants and supermarkets are very nearby the hotel , never the less it is located in a quiet street. I got a room in the main building as I requested not to be in the basement, the room is the highlight of the place , very clean and very comfortable, every thing feels new and of a high quality from the towels to the bed sheets and so on . The only serious problem you will face here is the sound proofing!!!! The room has ZERO insolation ! You would hear absoulotly everything in the other rooms and the corridors which makes it very difficult to sleep as early as the cleaning process starts!!! 
I don’t know what to say more if it was not for this issue I would say everything else was wonderful ",4,2018,04,23
103,"Good Hotel, Amazing Location","I stayed in a Club Double Room, the room was quite spacious for a single person although it was meant for two people. The hotel have very friendly and helping staff who are always there to help you in case if you are new in the city or need any advice. The best part about this hotel is its location from Paddington Station, its not even a 5 mins walk from the hotel, Lancaster gate station is also nearby and Hyde Park is just 100mtrs from here. The second best part was the breakfast, i would recommend to pre book breakfast at the time of check in as you can get around 30% discount on it that ways.",4,2018,04,23
103,"Nice, well located hotel with friendly staff","The room was not too big but enough for us. The room was very clean. In the room you will find:
- Water boiler, tea, instant coffee (refilled everyday)
- Two bottles of water (500 ml) with two glasses
- A microwave oven
- A refrigerator
- A cell phone with unlimited calls and internet that you can also bring away with you. Ours had some problem with the battery so we did not bother; we did not need it really and just wanted to try it

The staff is really kind and deserves the best mark they can get. We could hear people in the corridor but, this fact aside, the room was very quiet and we could sleep very well. The bed was also very comfortable. Breakfast was offered for 15 GBP per person per day but we cannot say anything about its quality, sinced we passed on and went for something directly to the city.

The hotel is very close to both the Paddington underground station and the Lancaster Gate underground station (about 5 min. walk), which made going to the city centre very easy and quick. Hyde Park is directly in front of the Lancaster Gate station, so it is also very convenient to go for a walk in those rare sunny London days (we were lucky enough!).

I will consider this hotel for future trips to London and can only recommend it.",5,2018,04,22
103,What a surprise !,"I found this hotel on line with a great price. I was a little anxious about it, but it surpassed by far my expectations !!

Location is just perfect close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations. The neighbourhood is so peaceful and quite. Staff is absolutely polite and helpful. The rooms are a little small, but normal for London. Everything very modern, clean and neat. Bathroom with a amazing Hansghroe shower. Absoiutely beautiful ! The breakfast is very fair and food is well done.",5,2018,04,20
103,Weekend Break,"Excellent room and buffet breakfast was very good. Polite friendly staff who looked after us and made our ruby wedding anniversary extra special. Ideally situated for Paddington station. Walked through nearby Hyde Park to Natural History Museum.Thanks to everybody.
Highly recommended",5,2018,04,18
103,Best place to stay around Paddington and Lancaster ,This place is just nearby from all the possible connections you need for business or tourist travel. The staff is super helpful. Free high speed internet and phone for local use is a great plus. The bar is well stocked. They offered a wine bottle as welcome gift. Not bad. Loved and no complaints. ,5,2018,04,16
103,Lovely staff and very clean comfortable hotel,"We have now stayed with the Park Grand hotel 3 times, (Lancaster Gate and Paddington Court) and they are the only hotels I think of when travelling to London. The staff are always exceptionally friendly and helpful. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere and is very clean and modern. We will definitely be returning a 4th time!",5,2018,04,16
103,Incredible stay ,"We had a fantastic stay at Park Grand Paddington Court. We came straight from an international flight and the hotel was a short stroll from Paddington Station. The rooms were very clean, the breakfasts were great everyday but the aspect which made our stay the best was the staff. We initially had planned to stay for 3 nights but stayed 6 in total due to myself falling extremely ill. The staff were absolutely amazing and continually checking in to ensure I was ok. Highly recommend staying here if you’re in London. ",5,2018,04,15
103,Mrs Nazzal ,I had a great afternoon tea experience in this hotel with my friend. Mr Joy was very kind and generous. He suggested that we should try the Indian masala tea and it was really delicious. The hotel is cozy and clean and all staff members were helpful and friendly. ,5,2018,04,15
103,One of the best stays ever,"Hello, I am a tour leader so I am very used to travelling with groups. I have always used this kind of hotels, but I had never been to Park Grand Paddington Court. I have always been very well accommodated in the other hotels from the same branch, but this one, not to mention the bell boys and the receptionists, has been one of the best I have had. The people were so nice, so kind and willing to help you all the time. Special mention to Louanne and the two bell boys. Thanks for everything. I REALLLY recommend this hotel if you go to London, whether it is for a short trip or a long one. The breakfast was excellent and the rooms recently renewed with all type of gadgets (microwave, smartphone...). Really, recommendable !!!!!",5,2018,04,10
103,Great service and nice location for a good price,"Coming from Stockholm, we stayed here during the easter of 2018, staying for 3 nights.

We had two rooms here, and we were pretty satisfied with them. The rooms were pretty small, I believe the double room was just as big as the single room, so as the single room was quite small, the double room was almost hard to walk around in. But setting the room size aside, the rooms were great. We all forgot to buy a travel adapter for the stay, but no problem; the rooms had installed other sockets than just British standard once, so we were fine! They also said they had adapters to loan out if one would need more sockets. All rooms also had a personal smartphone that could be brought with us when we went around London, which was great. The phones, android phones with Handy (the phone service) software adaptations, had unlimited internet, calls and text all around the world. The phone also had both standard apps, like a Google Chrome and Google Maps, but you could also download other apps from Play Store, like a subway map

The hotel served breakfast as well, but it was not included with the rooms. The breakfast was good, but not really worth the 10£ (around) it cost. Althought, we did buy it for all mornings, as it was close and easy. But if you know a good place nearby, that might be a good way to save money

The location of the hotel is great. Just a few minutes from Hyde Park, and several subway stations, you are close to most of the city. Although the subway was very close, we did not ride it until the last day, but walked everywhere instead. It is a good area to walk in, and streets such as Oxford Street is just a few minutes away!

Overall, this hotel is great. It is close to the city and multiple subway stations, and great service. But the breakfast was not spectacular and the rooms were pretty small. But good price!",4,2018,04,09
103,1/10,"This hotel is an absolute scam, spent a lot of money on a large double deluxe room to be forced into a little standard sized oven of a room. Avoid this scam of a hotel at all costs, the pictures you see online are fake, they are using images from the Paddington court. What a complete joke, I will find every avenue possible to get my money back. I promise you that.",1,2018,04,09
103,"Very good hotel, for a city trip","Very good hotel, with an excellent team. Location is perfect, 5 min. to walk from Paddington Station. Very calm. But if you don't like stairs, say it when you book your stay  or when you arrive at the hotel. Perfect hotel for a city trip. But if you want to stay longer, a bigger room with a bath, is better.",4,2018,04,09
103,"Nice hotel, great stay!","I stayed at this hotel with my mom and dad to celebrate my mom's 60th Birthday. I emailed them before we got there and asked them if they could do something for my mom. When we arrived they had upgraded their room and added a little surprise. The service was great, the breakfast was great, the rooms were great - overall a perfect stay!",5,2018,04,09
103,"Nice hotel, excellent service!","Location is very convenient, very close to Paddington station, breakfast was very good. 
But more than that, I would like to highlight professionalism of the hotel staff, especially Andrey and Olga. They have been very receptive to my requests, exceptionally friendly and kind. They went out of their way to help me with directions, printing boarding pass for me, and responded promptly to my other needs. I wish every hotel could have such a welcoming staff.  I'd be happy to stay at this hotel when I am in London next. 
Goulnar from Kazakstan",5,2018,04,06
103,Great quality for good price,"I initially moved to this hotel from another one In the area. It was such an upgrade and had a very similar price! The staff were all lovely and rooms were clean and comfortable  I actually extended my stay 3 times and it was a fancy home away from home. Thanks to Alice, Marian, Andrew and all the staff for a great stay!",5,2018,04,03
103,Perfect stay at a great hotel,"We stayed at Park Grand Paddington Court in early March for 5 nights and enjoyed every moment of it. The hotel is conveniently located in Paddington, within 5-8 minutes walk from Paddington station & plenty of restaurants & shops. 
We arrived the hotel just after 10 am. and were given an early check-in as requested. The room was impeccable but quite small. When we enquired about our room type at the reception later, the customer experience manager Ms. Luanne immediately came to help and upgraded us to a bigger room from the second day onwards. 
All the other reception staff was also very courteous and ready to help.
Breakfast was one of the best we have had as per European standards. Lavish spread with plenty of choices including vegetarian options and eggs of your choice cooked  to order. The breakfast staff Christina was new but always smiling and ready to help.
We highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again whenever we visit London.",5,2018,04,03
103,Great location - nice hotel,"Stayed two nights at the Park Grand Paddington Court and found the property to be comfortable and convenient.  Within a five minute walk from Paddington Station (rail and Underground service) the hotel is conveniently located to mass transit as well as Hyde Park.  The neighborhood has decent dining and feels safe.  The hotel breakfast is hearty and tasty and worth the additional cost when booking.

Like most big city hotels, the rooms are a bit small.  The furnishings and bed are comfortable and of high quality.  The staff is attentive.

There is a small bar on property and it appears they serve high tea in the mid-afternoon in this same bar area (note - it appears that all hotel guest traffic flows through this small dining/bar room which feels a bit awkward when tables are engaged in the tea service.)

Overall the hotel is a comfortable stay with a good breakfast and convenient to transportation and Heathrow Airport via the Paddington Express.

",4,2018,04,02
103,A fine hotel in every way!,"Situated in a quiet area close to Paddington Underground station we found a wonderfull little pearl of a hotel. The service is superb and personal from the minutter you arrive at the reception: Dario & Co showed a fine understanding for our needs and wishes. At the delicious breakfast treat in the restaurant or at high tea in the cosy cafe the staff were equally helpfull and serviceminded. 
The rooms are resently renovated and really nice and well equiped. 
We were so happy about our stay and will definitely return when we visit London next time.",5,2018,04,02
103,a very pleasant stay,"the room was small, but perfect for a single person.
no elevator, but the stuff helped with lifting the suitcase to the third floor.
amazing location - five minutes walk from Paddington station and from the Hide Park.",5,2018,04,02
103,DISAPPONTED,"Disappointing experience even before travel. I wanted to adjust booking to make it more flexible given the unconfirmed travel dates,but the hotel cared more about process than service and therefore declined to alter my booking,meaning I will pay for dates I may not even be there. Never mind that came with a 23 Days prior notice. Definitely not booking here ever again or recommending it for that matter",1,2018,04,02
103,Fabulous stay!,From the moment we arrived the staff were attentive and very welcoming. Our room was just as advertised and the pictures were true to there website. Beds are comfy and both the room and bathroom were spacious and clean. Large screen TV and free wifi. Within walking distance of Paddington station and lots of amenities.,5,2018,04,02
103,Excellent! ,"We stayed here for a long weekend in March. The rooms are very comfortable and modern. The extra touches made it feel luxurious! I can’t compliment the staff enough. They really cared about the guests and they couldn’t do enough for you. I travel for work and have stayed in a lot of hotels and the staff here stood out. The location is perfect, it’s a short walk to Paddington and Lancaster Gate underground. We will definitely be back!",5,2018,03,31
103,Excellent hotel,"Very nice hotel with great service and staff. The breakfast is very good and the location of the hotel, near Paddington Station, assure easy access to all destinations in London, Uk and also a very fast access to Heathrow Airport in only 25 min.",5,2018,03,30
103,Fantastic hotel with a warm welcome,"Staff very friendly and welcoming, room spotless clean, large tv, free WiFi , look no further, close to Paddington train station, everything you need for breakfast from the well laid out buffet, would stay again when in London .",5,2018,03,30
103,Great value,"I recently spent a week at the Park Grand Paddington Court and was highly impressed. I had a single room on the basement level which was very tight for space and smaller than it looked in the photos but was nevertheless extremely well-equipped and great value for money for such a central London location. Paddington station and tube are within easy walking distance. The buffet breakfast was absolutely superb, as was the quality of food served in the lounge bar. What really marks this hotel out though is the calibre of its staff, who were universally excellent across all departments. It's rare nowadays to find a hotel where the staff are so courteous, helpful, friendly, efficient and engaging. I'm sorry I didn't manage to get all their names to thank them individually but special mention must go to Corinne and the team on reception, the excellent concierge service, the bar staff and housekeeping, all of whom went out of their way to make my stay relaxing and enjoyable. Top marks to every single one of them. One minor niggle is that the fire alarm went off at midnight on two occasions during my stay - both times were false alarms and caused by a guest burning some toast in a microwave, I believe. A slight inconvenience to have been got out of bed twice for a false alarm, though I guess it's better to be safe than sorry with these things. Overall though, any negatives were relatively minor and I would definitely stay here again, albeit that I would probably opt for one of the larger rooms in future. Highly recommended and I cannot rate the staff highly enough. Had I opted for a bigger room I'm sure I would have given the hotel a five star rating.",4,2018,03,29
103,Amazing staff,"I stayed here for 3 days. I was initially sceptical since this was my first time in London. The staff was extremely friendly and understood my concerns. They put so many efforts to help us with our stay, food arrangements etc. I would especially like to thank Manon, Martina, Nuhau and Andrea for their outstanding hospitality.",4,2018,03,29
103,Great staff who really go out of their way for you.,"We came to London for a few days to begin one of many honeymoon trips as newlyweds so of course it was very special, even if we were visiting the city in March. At first, we were offered a room that did not have the best view, then moved to one where it seemed the walls were a bit too thin for our liking and then we finally ended up in a Club Room through a complimentary upgrade. Each time we made changes, there were zero issues. Reception was helpful on every occassion and Luanne, the Guest Relations person there, was fantastic. They really showed that they cared and greeted you with a smile and these are the little things that make the difference. There are hundreds of hotels in the city but its the thoughtfulness that creates a positive relationship.

The rooms themselves are quite nice but I would recommend staying in a Club Room. As I mentioned before, one of the rooms had thin walls and seem to be on the smaller size. The Club Room is quite spacious and feels like a proper room. Other than that, moving around the buildings (there are two) can feel like a maze, but this is me being picky. 

Location-wise, it is further away but again there are a few train stops (Paddington Court being one of them) about five minutes away that take you into the city. 

One last thing I would mention is having their afternoon tea. We had the indian afternoon tea and it was phenomenal. Again, this was easily arranged by Reception.

Thank you so much again for your thoughtfulness and care and we look forward to staying there again sometime in the near future.",5,2018,03,26
103,Amazing!,"Everything about the hotel was amazing, room, staff, location, and food! I got a complimentary room upgrade with a free breakfast because it was my partners birthday. 100% would recommend this hotel! 5*",5,2018,03,25
103,Appalling to make contact with!!!,"Well i won't be staying at this hotel tomorrow for 1 night. 
Although the inital booking failing could be my fault and i didn't finalise it correctly, i realised a week after making my booking I'd had no confirmation email.
So i made contact via email as the tel number had this message CONSTANTLY 
System busy 
I recieved an email back after a few days asking for more details firstly name of booking when my name was clearly on the email 🤔
I provided all the details and was asked for more details in another email.
My email was marked urgent in the re: as my stay was coming up.
No reply no urgency. What kind of a hotel has a phone number constantly busy and takes a week to send 2 emails and still gets no where with resolving anything!!
This trip was for myself to meet friends for my 40th birthday surprise celebrations and this hotel was chosen as near to who i would be meeting etc.
Again today no email and tried all day on the phone. Eventually tried the 0800 number instead of the 020 and was put into a queue. 12 mins later i gave up!!
Absolutely atrocious in every aspect and they will not be getting my money for a stay.
God knows what will happen if i do actually have a successful booking and they take my money for a no show!!
STAY AWAY IF YOU LIKE A HOTEL TP PROVIDE COMMUNICATION. 
Birthday ruined!! Thanks a lot park grand!!!",1,2018,03,25
103,Shivani kaul,"Fantastic hotel , amazing hostipality, great people ..if anybody want any to stay close to home ., stay in this hotel they give you the feeling. All staff members are so well trained , especially the manager and bottom staff ., Luanne you are great",5,2018,03,22
103,Handy Location & Modest Rates,"On a recent business trip to London  I needed a hotel room in central location, handy to public transport. The Park Grand Paddington Court is about a ten minute walk from Paddington station, just north of Hyde Park. If you're driving, you can park under the station which is just outside the congestion tax zone. 
The rooms are compact but clean, ideal if you just need somewhere to retire at the end of the day. The buffet breakfast is great and very good value at £11.00. There is a fitness centre, free wi-fi and a number of lounges where you can meet with colleagues or find a table and a coffee and do some work. The staff are friendly and quite helpful. 
A quirky feature of this hotel is it is something of a rabbit-warren. There are staircases and passage ways with a maze of turns you must navigate to find your way back to reception. 
Good for a short business trip",4,2018,03,22
103,Disappointing experience,"After I saw this place on Tripadvisor it looked to have very good feedback from customers but our experience did not live up to the reviews. The first thing I found strange and I didn't like was that we had to pay in full at check in.
We stayed in a compact double room for 3 nights which I expected to be compact and it was! Be aware if you are thinking of booking the compact double room for 2 people it is very tight! This is nothing against the hotel as the room name suggests the size but I would not recommend it for more than one person.
The room itself had alot of potential to be great but we found the following problems with our room that we would not expect from a 4 star hotel. 
- Our biggest issue was that thermostat did not work consistently. The room was freezing for the majority of our stay (especially at night). It worked on one of the days but it just wasn't powerful enough.
- The underfloor heating in the bathroom had a minimum heating setting which was way too hot to stand on. This made it unusable.
- A small thing like the lights which had a dimmer switch that didn't work well at all made the lights  flicker at a dimmer setting. I know this is a minor problem but I think it adds to the overall picture of the hotel.
Breakfast which was included in our rate was very average. The hot food was good but the rest was nothing special. The orange juice was watery (probably from concentrate) and the coffee was undrinkable it was so bitter. 

Overall we felt this was not a 4 star experience. This hotel seemed to fall down on the basics. I would not recommend the Park Grand Paddington based on this experience.",2,2018,03,20
103,Great boutique hotel near Paddington,"I selected Park Grand as I wanted a hotel near Paddington Station. The price was right, and it was convenient. The staff is excellent! I arrived after 14 hours of travel, exhausted, and they found me a room to check into early. 

The room was tiny - a single twin bed, and small bathroom. But it was spotless, comfortable, and modern. There was coffee, tea, water and a biscuit. Heated floor in the bathroom. 

I will definitely stay there again.",4,2018,03,18
103,Amazing hotel and great location,"Thank you so much.. i truly loved the staff(Andrew was so helpful every day), hotel and the location.. it was first time in Europe and I was in love.. coming back for sure. As travel agent I will recommend the hotel. Also I loved the idea of the handy phone it saved my life lol a few times calling my family back in the States. Very helpful and convenient feature to offer. 

",5,2018,03,18
103,Incredible,"The Hotel is very beautiful, directly at Lancaster Gate (underground Station), and high class decorated. 

The Staff was amazingly polite and we Had the feeling that especially Dan, and Luanne wanted to make our Stay as comfortable as possible.
We are defenitaly comming back to this Hotel again. 

We booked without Food so we cant say anything about it , but i Can imagen that it is great since they put a lot of effort in everything here.",5,2018,03,18
103,Great hotel,"Great stay in a great hotel! Everything was excellent, very client oriented service. Special thanks to Dan! Absolutely will stay here again.",5,2018,03,17
103,Great hotel and nicest personnel,"Great place to stay in London! The personnel, just to mention a few, Corina, Daiana, Marian, Alex, Florin and all the others are welcoming and totally comitted to the guests! Late in the evening coming back from the outside snow, the hotel gym workout felt like a breeze...",5,2018,03,17
103,Best customer service and my best stay!,"I would like to thank all the hotel staff, especially Olga and Andrey! 
I had amazing stay for 3 days in this hotel and it was my best hotel experience in London for the last 8 yeas! 
I booked 1 double room and everything was so great, and hotel management asked me to change the room to the best one if i want. But my room was really good. I really enjoyed my time in London this time. All staff was really helpful and nice! Thank you! I will stay at this hotel next time!",5,2018,03,14
103,Absolutely first class,"My wife book us into this hotel with two friends for a Friday and Saturday night break - 9th to 11th March.  From the moment we arrived it was clear we’d found something special.  The staff were charming, the room (119), albeit small, was spotless and the bed comfortable.  Our friends were in 120 which was slightly larger - we’d go for this one next time.

The attention to detail by the room cleaning staff was second to none with finger marks on the toilet flush button being polished off and the soap dish cleaned.  Tiny things I know, but important.

We had no traffic noise - unusual for London, so slept well.  The ‘rain shower’ was brilliant as was the sink.  I was able to shave and rinse my face without banging my head on the tap!

The members of staff that deserve a special mention are; Olga, Alice, Luannen, Marian and Andrew.  Well done all, because you were all so welcoming and helpful, we will be returning.",5,2018,03,14
103,Great stay,Very good hotel with very nice staff and good service. The breakfast was also very good with lots to choose from. When we arrived we also got an upgrade and a surprise in the room due to my wife's birthday. Over all very satisfied.,4,2018,03,14
103,My AWESOME Stay!,"I've been to London before, but it was my 1st time at this fantastic place! Brilliant location, Great facilities, super friendly staff and amazing value for money. It would definitely be my 1st choice every time I visit London.",5,2018,03,13
103,Brilliant ,"Myself and my partner spent the weekend here, We had an excellent stay! The staff  went above and beyond to make it special by making us feel really welcome & also acknowledging a special occasion we were celebrating!  ",5,2018,03,12
103,Great customer service,"We initially booked two rooms, one for 3 nights for my wife and one for 2 nights for her father who was due to join us for his 70th birthday. This was the week of the ‘beast from the east’ and consequently travel was difficult and the father in law was unable to make it to London. The hotel was good enough to cancel the second room without penalty which was good as this was not necessarily the policy. We had a room in the basement which was fine, albeit fairly compact. The hotel is very convenient for Paddington station and close to Notting hill which is a great location.
We checked out in a hurry and left some stuff in the room which the hotel kindly posted back to us, at their expense. Great customer service. I’d certainly use this hotel again and the rate was very reasonable",5,2018,03,12
103,The best hotel ❤️,"This hotel is very comfortable and has helpful staff , they hav fast service and the staffs are very kind they helped us for many things 
we enjoyed in the hotel .

Thank u andrew ❤️
Thank u very much ❤️

103,Just amazing!,"This was our first visit to this hotel, but it won't be our last. The staff could not have cared for us any better. A special thank you must go to Luanne, she went out of her way to make sure we were looked after. I had booked this visit in March last year and must have mentioned that it was for a special occasion. The staff remembered and we were upgraded to a suite with champagne and chocolates. I have already booked our room for next March.",5,2018,03,11
103,Good price/quality ,"It has been a really nice weekend! Comfortable room and very nice staff who assisted us perfectly. Thanks to Olga, in particular, who treated us like a very special guests. I would suggest as a good solution for staying in London. Clean, elegant, well maintained hotel closed to Paddington tube station.",5,2018,03,11
103,Amazing service at Park Grand Paddington Court,"Wow what can I say everything was beyond my expectations, from the moment we walked in to the moment we left the service we received here was honestly the best I have experienced. We were very lucky and were upgraded to a suite room on the opposite side of the building it was so clean and modern. Loved the little gifts in the room when we arrived.
Truthfully the best experience of a hotel stay I have ever had, definitely be revisiting on our next trip to London!!!

A special thanks to Luanne for our experience!",5,2018,03,08
103,Stay Away!!!! Much Better Options,"I was quite excited about this hotel based on the number of positive reviews, but I had a much less pleasant experience than many others it seems.  Upon arrival, the lobby area is nice and the wait to check in was very short.  The person at the desk was very pleasant and went through the check in process.  At some point he asked me if I minded a higher floor and I said I didn't what I apparently missed is that there was no elevator to the part of the hotel I had been assigned.  I had two large suitcases with me, and some poor valet got stuck dragging them all over the hotel, through a labyrinth of passageways and up 4 floors of stairs.  I felt terrible for him.   Upon arriving at the room, I couldn't get over how tiny it was.  There wasn't room for me and my bags, and I was constantly moving things around to traverse the three feet to the bathroom.  The bathroom was fine, other than that the toilet was wedged into a space so small that you would have to be a master yogi to use it.  The room was clean enough, but seemed a little run down.  Complimentary water bottle was already open, towels were a little wet, climate control didn't seem to do much.  Walls were very thin and I heard the comings and goings of the other poor souls relegated to the annex.  Woke up early for my train, and had to lug all my bags down all the stairs and passageways and outside to the train.  Will never stay here again.

Overall, the hotel itself is a 1, but the staff was excellent and the 15 minute walk to Paddington Station bring it up to a 2.  Will not be coming back.",2,2018,03,08
103,Short Stay in London at the Park Grand Paddington,"Thankyou for your email!!! We enjoyed our stay with you immensely!!!! I commend your staff for their brilliant service and attention to our every requirements!!! All aspects of your hotel were excellent!!! Porters, reception, bar and breakfast restaurant!!! Thus has to be my best experience in any hotel I have ever stayed in!!! Congratulations and thankyou for making our stay so pleasurable!! Kind regards Vicki Luckhurst😁👍",5,2018,03,06
103,Amazing service making my 30th birthday all the more special ,"My husband booked us in here for my 30th birthday.  From checking in Alice was very friendly and made us feel welcome, she noticed it was my birthday and gave us a complimentary upgrade. After spending the evening in the center of London we returned back to find Flowers chocolates and prosseco waiting for us.  A very nice touch and would definitely recommend. Great service all round, not to mention Dan who carried our luggage to our room. ",5,2018,03,05
103,Windy night,"My colleague and me stayed at this hotel during our business weekend. The location and the neighborhood was great as the stuff and that is the only reason i gave poor rate not terrible. They gave us room in the -1 floor which I get first time in my life and to be worse, wind was going through my window so it was cold in the room! I couldn’t sleep weel because i heard steps and bed scretching above my room. In the morning when we get to breakfast which is also on -1, we had to wait for 10 minutes because they didn’t have enough tables for everyone and they offered us to take food and go to the bar what is rediculous because it is on ground floor. All in all, when I go back to London this is definitely the place in I will stay. ",2,2018,03,05
103,friendly and helpful,"We stayed in the depandance (in front of the reception desk).
The room was new, clean. New bathrobes and slippers. Excellent reception service: fresh fruit, kettle, biscuits. Excellent location: close to 2 subways. Area also served with restaurants and shops.",4,2018,03,05
103,BAD hotel,"Bad servise,rooms to small,thay charge my card and i have from bank prof but thay wont i live deposit..Thay take 200 £ more..thay lost my bag i waith and my taxi charge me and leave me beacouse he waith to much..BAD hotel..never again..",1,2018,03,05
103,I'll definitely return next time,"Great hotel for the price. Room nice with all the usual - tea,coffee and toiletries etc. Microwave and fridge also which is seful if your there for a few days and fed up with spending money.  Room is compact but fine for what we needed. Hotel provide a mobile free of charge with unlimited calls, google maps which saves your own phone. Bed and pillows really comfy and generally very quiet at night. The hotel was really clean. 

The breakfast is too expensive and unless in with the price I wouldn't have it next time as the choice for veggies is ok but not brilliant. There's a lovely little cafe just up the road.

The hotel is in a great location if like us you want to be fairly central for sightseeing. Tube and Paddington station 5 minute walk. 

Staff were pleasant and the concierge was really helpful giving us a great itinerary for our first day. Breakfast staff were a bit miserable, but I'm not full of the joys first thing!",5,2018,03,01
103,Friendly and accomadating,"Absolutely loved this gorgeous hotel! All the staff were so friendly and accommodating, especially Felicia and Andrea at the front desk. The junior suite had a lovely view with fresh fruit and flowers. There was also a smart phone device in my room which had internet and I could take out on day trips ect, which I found so helpful! Thanks so much guys!",5,2018,03,01
103,Fantastic,Stayed her 11-13th Feb 18.   Boutique hotel with the right amount of personal touch.  Attention to detail was very impressive right down to the serving staff at breakfast wearing white gloves (husband is a chef).  The food was plentiful and fantastic.  Stayed in a club room (moved from double room) which was no trouble and the staff moved our belongings as we were out.  Bed was soft and comfortable and the room had everything we need. Place was spotless.  The lovely bonus of under floor heating in the bathroom. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  5 min walk from Paddington station.  Lots of restaurants in the area. I cant recommend enough. Will defo be returning at the next available opportunity,5,2018,02,27
103,Unbelievable!,"This hotel was an unbelievable experience for my girlfriend and I and the service shown by the staff, the manager Mr Sakar especially, was fantastic. The rooms were spotless and well kept up. Whatever your needs, this hotel will not only meet them, but exceed them in every way possible. 
Thank you so much for such a welcoming stay. We will be coming back very soon! ",5,2018,02,27
103,Good stay in London,"Excellent location, near Paddington rail station and two tube stops.  We had a ""deluxe"" twin room, which was small, as expected.  Beds were comfortable, and room was very clean.  Room also had some nice additional touches, such as the Handy Phone(an I phone you are free to use) and a variety of different sockets for your electric gadgets-for example, was able to plug in my US tablet without an adapter.  Bathroom was large, clean, and had plenty of hot water in the rain forest shower.
Breakfast, served buffet style, was superb.  Plenty of plentiful choices, so you could have a continental or English breakfast, or a bit of both.
Many and divers restaurants in the area, and many pubs, as well as several small grocers within a few minutes' walk.
Staff were uniformly friendly and helpful.
One weak area: the front desk.  This is a very busy and popular hotel, and at check-in, and check-out, the front desk personnel were simply overwhelmed, leading to significant waiting time to check in or out.  There's a simple fix for this: add more staff at the desk.
So this review is a five star, minus.  But would stay here again, and would recommend it to others.",5,2018,02,25
103,Nice but not my style,"It's a little too boutique for my liking.  I like larger brands like Hilton or Marriott where you are feeling like the bang for your buck.  First time in London and felt pretty nickled and dimed for everything here.  Don't get me wrong, its a very nice looking place.  Just small, didn't feel accommodating.",3,2018,02,25
103,Wonderful,"It was our first time in London with my girlfriend and we spent a wonderful night, we had a very warm welcome, the staff, who was very nice with us, had made a romantic bed with heart-shaped flowers... It was beautiful. I recommend this hotel to whoever wants to stay in London for a trip!",5,2018,02,25
103,Very Pleasant and welcome  ,"The staff was wonderful.they were very warm, welcoming, attentive, and cheerful.
They send me a “welcome”treat that I appreciated very much. The staff was remarkably wonderful and checked me in a timely manner ",5,2018,02,25
103,Brilliant,"Very nice Hotel located in a lovely area close to Lancaster Gate and Paddington stations.
Wonderful cosy room and I enjoyed the delicious breakfast. The team very professional at the front desk. Will definitely stay again",5,2018,02,23
103,Anniversary short  break to London,"If I could give 6 stars I would !! We stayed one night , simply chose it as it was near Paddington station but will be returning for more next trip . Yes the room was small but to be expected in London . It was extremely clean comfortable and very modern and well equipped . Luanne asked us the reason for our visit and we told her it was our anniversary ,when we got to our room she had gone above and beyond to make us feel special .cake ,fruit and wine and soft drinks all complementary ! Beautiful towel swans and rose petals on the bed .. We were amazed . All the staff were so nice and helpful .it was a pleasure to stay at Park Grand Paddington court and I would highly recommend it to anyone .",5,2018,02,19
103,Fab hotel,"My aunt and I stayed here when visiting London to watch Ovo at the Royal Albert Hall and absolutely loved this hotel. The staff were lovely, literally couldn't do enough for you and were so friendly and approachable. The breakfast was great, very tasty and served in their lovely restaurant/through room service. The hotel was clean and had a lovely atmosphere as you walked through the door and the lounge was great to chill out in with a strawberry mojito! The rooms were lovely and the beds were so comfy I didn't want to get up in the morning! Only one small downside and that's the size of the rooms, ours was a little snug, but apart from that I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying again next time I'm in London. ",5,2018,02,19
103,Excellent and great value hotel in central London,"I stayed at the Paddington Court with my wife for a few nights over her birthday. The hotel moved us up to a larger room and provided a few nice birthday treats like flowers and cake left on the bed. The room was very comfortable and warm and I liked the complimentary wine and soft drinks left for us. The complimentary breakfast was really very good with plenty of choices and certainly filled us up in preparation for busy days in London. All the staff at this hotel were top class. Very professional, helpful and polite. I will definitely be back at this hotel soon.",5,2018,02,18
103,Lovely staff,"The location was perfect for Paddington Station. Close to bus routes. The room was very comfortable.  It was my husband's birthday, and the staff had been very thoughtful in remembering it with a card,wine, fruit and cake. The staff were incredibly polite, friendly and helpful. We would definitely stay there again.",5,2018,02,18
103,"Snug room, good value for money","The overall experience of the hotel was good, all staff that we encountered were friendly and helpful at check-in. The hotel was clean and modern with a nice bathroom. We only had a small room with one side of the bed against a wall. But for one night and the price we paid in London this was absolutely fine. The one bizarre thing that happened during our stay is that an alarm went off at just before 1:45 am. I believe it was a fire alarm and we jumped out of bed with a fright. But the alarm went off very quickly. My husband went to reception to see if we should evacuate our room but heard someone say it was a false alarm. Obviously accidents happen, but there was no explanation from the hotel about what had happened at all. I expected to wake up in the morning to find a note under the door or even some comment at check-out, but not a word from anyone. Having had such a nice experience with everything else, this was a disappointing end to our stay with such a frightening awakening in the night.",3,2018,02,17
103,Fantastic staff,"The staff at this hotel went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable.  They were helpful, friendly and accommodating at all times.  When the reception staff realised I was returning to London after a long absence they sent a complimentary bottle of wine and dessert to help me celebrate my trip.  The rooms were lovely and clean.  I will be staying here again when next in London!",5,2018,02,15
103,Tiny Room,"I stayed here after being sent from another of their sister hotels due to some mix up. So I wasn't too happy when I arrived. However, check in went okay and there was a man to carry my bags and show me to my room. This was good as my room was across the street in a completely different building! This was not good. I was even more disappointed when led down some narrow stairs into the basement and shown into a very small room. There was a window which looked into a square courtyard with barely enough room for a handkerchief and a direct view into the adjacent room. I kept the curtains shut.
I didn't really get a good nights sleep as the room was quite hot, but the bed was reasonably comfortable and everything was very clean and tidy. The bathroom was nice and the shower in the morning was also very good.
For breakfast I had to cross back over the street. It was not obvious where the breakfast room was and it was a while before I found someone to direct me. The waitress seemed most put out that I didn't want a tea or coffee with my breakfast. The food was good and I enjoyed my meal. This was not the hotel I was expecting but I haven't let that colour my judgement. I am reviewing as honestly as I can. This was not as good as it could have been.",3,2018,02,12
103,Overall a great place to stay,"This is a lovely boutique style hotel. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. Our room was a Club Room and very nice. Is was nice that they had a USB port for charging. The amenities provided were nice.It was very clean and well maintained. The location is nice. A quiet area, but easy to access the rest of London on the tube. Lancaster Gate station is the closest, however in the opposite direction and one'or two blocks further is Paddington Station. There are lots of restaurants and shops at this station. There is one minor reason and one major reason that I did give this property a
 ""5"". The minor reason,our room was on the lower lever so we had a view of a window well. This was minor, however limited the natural light to the room, and honestly if not for the major reason, would not be critical. The major reason - twice we asked for a wake up call, to ensue we used all means as we had specific times to be on time for a tour and being picked up for our Eurostar Train and both times the hotel failed to provide the call. This was extremely disappointing and stressful.  Travelers depend on wake up calls and this should be a given. The fact that this was missed twice is why I rated the way I did. With that said, I would highly recommend staying here and will stay there on our next trip to London. I will just ensure I bring  a travel alarm.",4,2018,02,11
103,4 star hotel with 5 star service ,"I love staying in park grand Paddington court, cheap prices and and high standards of room and service. 
Fatma is the star of the reception in the hotel, always smiling and helpful. 
The hotel staff go beyond expectations for the service. 
Definitely coming back. ",5,2018,02,11
103,Awful,"Freezing cold room. Shower freezing cold. Heating didn’t work. Tiny, tiny, tiny room. Complained to front desk staff who didn’t seem terribly bothered and were rather rude. 
I cut short my stay and booked elsewhere. Don’t bother. ",1,2018,02,11
103,Fantastic stay,"Recently had a wonderful stay at this hotel made very special by Luanne who delivered a very warm welcome and continued to deliver excellent service throughout our stay. 
Lovely room, great location. Will definitely go again and would recommend.",5,2018,02,11
103,Not as expected,"Although the location of the hotel is perfect and close to the marvelous Hyde park and near to Oxford street the shopping center, but I was disappointed when I found a very tiny room that they call double and it hardly could bear a single person, the quickly responded to my complaint and offered an larger room but in the basement!! Anyway the room equipped with a mini bar and a microwave. The path is also tiny but clean.  I booked a bed only room but I don’t think they have a restaurant for breakfast, just a small coffee hall. I would think for another hotel in my next visit to London.",2,2018,02,09
103,Just what I needed,"Location was great with very friendly and helpful staff in Reception and on the door. My room was good with a comfortable bed and a good shower. Breakfast set me up for the day. All in all, a good nights sleep - just what I needed.",5,2018,02,09
103,Great Hotel for Birthday Trip to London,"Very nice hotel about 5 mins walk from Paddington Station. We were given a room upgrade as it was my 30th bday. The room was a great size and the bed and pillows were very comfy. When we arrived back to the hotel in the evening after going to the theatre we found a cake towel sculpture with fresh flowers on it on our bed as well as an actual piece of cake. This was a lovely surprise and we appreciated it - thank you. Breakfast was good quality and there was a varied selection. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.

The only downside was that there was some kind of fan near the window to our room (maybe to do with the heating system?) and it was noisy throughout the night. 

Overall though we enjoyed our stay. 

",4,2018,02,07
103,Average “club room” for what we paid for,"Generally, the location is very good, breakfast is average, and reception staff needs training in how to manage reservations and their visitors! I don’t want to mention the unexpected incident we had upon arrival but if we did not insist not to charge us the first night and give us complimentary free breakfast all the days we were there the hotel management wouldn’t care i think a lot. Actually we asked to see the hotel manager but never showed up was in meetings all time. Our case was solved with the help of the client service person a very helpful lady that listened to our complain and took action. Breakfast staff really very polite and helpful too. Room was average and expected more that what was offered!!! ",3,2018,02,06
103,"Great Hotel, great staff","It is already 6-7th times I am staying in this hotel, and each time it is pleasure. The hotel is very good, especially the staff. i would like to thank all the staff, and special thanks to Dan, Andrew and Fatma. I think good staff is one of the main points of successful business, especially in service. So the executives of this business are lucky they have such wonderful staff. Thank once again.",5,2018,02,06
103,Great Staff. Great Location.,This was our 4th time staying at the Park Grand Paddington Court. It has been the perfect hotel in the perfect location for us everytime. It is close to 2 tube stations and a few blocks from Paddington train station (no need to lug your suitcases through the tube from or to the airport). You can be in Hyde Park in 5 minutes and the neighborhood has amazing restaurants (Taormina and The Mitre). The rooms are extremely comfortable and the breakfast is amazing. Luanne realized we were returning guests and upgraded our room on our last stay. I've never felt so special before! I can't imagine ever staying at a different hotel when in London! I highly recommend it!,5,2018,02,05
103,Great hotel. Great location,"Have to say as far as business hotels, well located go this place is great. 
Staff very friendly, room service reasonably priced. 
Rooms are on the small side but for London ok.
Paddington station a stone's throw away for Heathrow express also. I would stay here again for sure when back in London. ",4,2018,02,05
103,Superb,"Had a wonderful stay and Alice on reception made my wife’s birthday even more special with the extra attention she gave to us  and made our stay memorable 🎁🎁 well done Alice , your a credit to the Park Grand hotel from Alan and Pauline ",5,2018,02,04
103,Birthday treat.,My partner booked for a surprise for my birthday and as he is a wheelchair user he phoned to make sure that the room would be suitable for him and was assured that it was .on arrival we were shown to our room which though was very nice we realised that it wasn't suitable for my partner . So he went back to reception to have a word and they couldn't have been more helpful they said they would try to find us a more suitable room after waiting a little while they rang us back to say they had got us another room and that they would up grade us to a suite at no extra cost .we were shown to our room which was a crossed the road to the hotel once again the porter was straight there to help my partner up and down the steps and to carry our luggage on shown to our new room we were blown away it was so much bigger .The help we had from the porter I think his name was Andrew was truly 1st class to the extent that if he saw us when we came out of the building when our room was he would come across to help my partner up and down the steps .All in all we had a truly amazing stop ..,5,2018,02,03
103,Hotel overbooked! Yet still selling rooms,"Turned up at 10pm for my room they had previously taken payment for that day. Only to be told I am being moved hotels to a sister hotel nearby. Something to do with a fire they had. 

Sounds like they had overbooked the rooms. Wouldn’t have been an issue had they forewarned me, and even worse you could still book the same deluxe room for that night on the website. 

Would avoid.... ",1,2018,01,31
103,"Long weekend to Visit Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, as well as other attractions.","I picked this Hotel because of its high Reviews and for a stay in London the price was as expected, for the money I paid and the reviews I expected a 10/10.

but as its a reviewer let's tell the true experience, after a long journey from the Channel Islands arrived at the Hotel,

Staff extremely helpful and apologetic due to a que, when we checked in, and as we had arrived before the time which you were allowed you room they said they would put our bags some where safe, being London and concerned about the safety of our luggage we then had to hang around for 10/15 mins waiting for someone to take it to be locked away.

We left the hotel to go and find Hyde Park and have a look around it and to see Diana's Memorial fountain, on return to the Hotel we were shown our room which was across the road, and our luggage was taken their by a helpful Male staff member, the room was a paid upgraded larger room, hate to think what size a normal room would be, (but the size of Hotel rooms in London are normally small) it was only to sleep in.

Bed and linen were fine, pillows not greatly soft, bathroom all nice a modern with the novelty of a rain shower as well as a normal shower attachment, towels changed daily and room made up daily, 2 cans of fizzy drinks a small bottle of wine and Tea and Coffee were provided, as well as a bowl of fresh fruit. 

The room had a kettle, fridge and microwave as well as iron and ironing board and hair dyer, large flat screen T.V and a combination safe.

7/10 for cleanliness of the room potato chips under the edge of the bed, stained bath Matt on arrival, (disappeared thankfully the next day,) toilet seat not clean on of my hates, had wipes so cleaned it myself, and seemed only one toilet roll was provided and available on arrival so had to buy more, (think they got the hint and they were topped up.)

Breakfast was good buffet style and full English breakfast, but some of the walls of the dining room had see better days and needed a good clean.

For the Hundreds paid for just 3 nights don't think we will stay here again, might have been Grand a while ago, but I never go the feeling !",3,2018,01,29
103,Perfect birthday treat,"My boyfriend booked this hotel for our last night in London for a treat for my birthday & it definitely didn't disappoint.
On arrival the staff at reception were exceptional & just through conversation the girl dealing with our check in discovered we were there to celebrate my birthday - she then proceeded to tell us that they had upgraded us just to help us celebrate which I thought was so kind in itself!!
We then were on our way to our room when a kind employee insisted to take our bags to our room for us & explained everything we needed to know on the way!
Our room was beautiful, so clean & had everything we could've possibly (handy info especially for those traveling from its use the UK - they provide a mobile phone which you can take anywhere with you with free calls, texts & internet!!) (There is also a 24 hour room service app that is all explained on a card in your room - great after arriving in late at night!)
Upon arriving back to our room later that night we found rose petals sprinkled on the bed, a little card written to me to wish me a happy birthday & a slice of cake!! It was such a beautiful touch & honestly made me feel so special! 
I had such a great sleep, regardless of our window leading on to the street as the bed was so comfy!
This hotel was a definite highlight of my birthday weekend!! I hope to visit again!
Thank you to all the staff!!",5,2018,01,29
103,Excellent place and location ,"The hotel is a great place and we had a good stay. Special thanks for Alisa, Corina, and the resturant team . They were very kind, helpful and made us enjoy the daily breakfast.                                 
The location of the hotel is very good with many restaurants and groceries around. ",4,2018,01,29
103,Fantastic service and great room,"We had a very warm welcome and excellent service from Luanne. She is such a great ambasador for the hotel. We were also taken care of so well by Andrew the Porter. Both could not do enough to assist. Very impressed with the room and it is a great location.

I had been recommended this hotel by my daughter and her partner and I would highly recommend to others. Will definitely return.

Thanks Luanne and Andrew for your attention.",5,2018,01,24

103,Very good relation quality vs price,"I strongly recommend the Park Grand Paddington Court - it is a cozy hotel, the staff is attentive to our needs, solicitous and professional.  It is at a walking distance from Paddington tube station and I found the relation quality-price a very good one.",4,2018,01,23
103,Nice hotel!,"The hotel was both clean and cosy and the staff was amazing!  
The rooms are quite small but really nice.  We stayed there for four nights and I would definetly stay there again, and you have to get the breakfast cause it's amazing.",4,2018,01,22
103,Great Location,"this hotel is in a very good location. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Very close to Paddington station, and with many bars, restaurants and shops nearby. The room was very clean and comfortable.",4,2018,01,22
103,Nice but risky,"The first night i got a double room that doesn't even fit one person. The ""window"" was facing a brick wall. The next day they moved me to a different room which was tiny but had a window. The room is small but pleasant. The bathroom is small but warm and clean. I'm visiting London again but too scared to book at that hotel of fear to get a dungeon rather than a proper room. ",3,2018,01,22
103,Amazing Value,"Myself and my partner stayed at your hotel on 21/22 December 2017. On arrival we were welcomed with a drink and for some unknown reason we were upgraded to a large room with free breakfast - the room was huge and so nice. We also returned from Winter Wonderland to find our bed with chocolates and rose petals which was lovely. We slept in the other bed so we didn't ruin it.

I do not know what we did to deserve all these extra treats and bonuses but thank you - it was lovely!

The next time we come to London I will not look for any other hotel apart from yours!!",5,2018,01,22
103,Indian afrernoon tea,"we had a superb experience. Alisa, Joy and Cacez being very attentive and always made sure our glasses were filled up. We had plenty of hot drinks and fizz. the place is not far from paddington station.",5,2018,01,21
103,The perfect birthday treat for my sister,"We had a very enjoyable time during our delicious Indian Inspired Afternoon Tea, which was accompanied by a vast range of teas and a bottle of bubbly. Excellent service, exceptional food. Highly recommended to all.",5,2018,01,21
103,Great location and great stuff,"Nice atmosphere and great service on my three nights stay in London. I had two separate reservation and reception was able to combine those that I could stay in the same room. Stayed in single room, room was just renovated and very cosy. Breakfast was also good. Would stay here again.",4,2018,01,20
103,Excellent  Team,"Great  service  and  excellent  team.  They  are  so  friendly  that  you  do  not  want  to  go  out  from  the  hotel.  Alice  and  Fatos  are  the  best  at  the  front  desk.  And  Joy  at  the  bar  can  prepare  delicious  cocktails  for  you.  We  will  absolutely  choose  this  place  again  for  our  next  trip.
I  would  like  to  thank  Alice  for  sending  me  a  birthday  cake.
See  you  soon.

103,Great central spot from which to explore London.,"From the convenient location to the check-in experience, to the quality of the accommodation and the level of service during our stay, I am unable to fault the place and would certainly recommend it to friends.",5,2018,01,19
103,Indian Afternoon Tea,Thoroughly enjoyed the unique indian take on an afternoon tea. The food was delicious and the staff were very attentive. The bar area we were seated in was not as fancy as i would have liked and it was quite small but i would still highly recommend giving this a go if you want something different. ,4,2018,01,19
103,Great value. Great staff. Fantastic stay..,"We had a lovely three night stay here and wish we could have stayed longer! I was worried at first as the room is described as 'compact' but a large window and clever use of space meant the room was a decent size and obviously with so much to do in London we were hardly in the room anyway. The location is great! The breakfast each morning was good with attentive staff and a constantly refreshed buffet. The staff really made a big impression, all helpful and friendly and even putting a treat in our room on our third day! The front desk staff and the porter especially welcoming and made us feel like royalty. We will definitely be back. Thank you all for a lovely stay. 
Room 308",5,2018,01,18
103,Great Hotel for London Trip,"We stayed in a compact double, which while small, is still very comfortable for 2 people. The room is very updated with modern finishes, and the bathroom comes with heated flooring, which is wonderful after walking in the cold all day! The staff are very friendly and extremely accommodating. 

The location is also fantastic. It’s about a 7 minute walk to Hyde Park, 20 minutes to Kensington Palace, 5 minutes to Paddington train station and underground station, 30 minutes to Notting Hill, and 40 to Buckingham Palace. Some of that might seem like too far to walk for some, but it’s such a pleasant walk. If you don’t want to walk, as mentioned the underground is very close by. 

Overall, a wonderful hotel that I would recommend to anyone for a trip to London!",5,2018,01,17
103,Traditional afternoon tea for 2- groupon voucher,"We had a wonderful experience at the Park Grand Paddington Court using a groupon voucher for traditional afternoon tea for 2 with a bottle of prosecco. Every detail was attended to, including some additional dietary requirements for my Mum to make sure that she had a lovely time. We were served by Alisa who made us feel like we were the only guests there. We were also frequently offered top ups of drinks and tea. The food was delicious and there were so many cakes that we had to take some home! We had a very special afternoon so thank you very much, we can't wait for our next visit! Would definitely recommend!!",5,2018,01,16
103,Amazing! ,"Park Grand Paddington Court is such a beautiful hotel, hidden away in a nice & quiet location! I booked to stay here as an Anniversary Present for me and my partner and I’m so glad I did. Alice and the Team went above and beyond to make it special for us, I can’t thank them enough. I would Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an affordable stay but with the luxury of a more expensive hotel. I will 100% be returning here on my next visit to London! 

Thank you so much, hopefully we’ll see you again soon! ",5,2018,01,15
103,not stayed,Haven't actually stayed here but have been on the phone for the last couple of hours just trying to cancel my stay but have been on left on hold. I called the actual hotel but was told they don't deal with cancellations and they told me to call the numbers on the website. So here I am still waiting and writing this at the same time. Not impressed! I definitely will not be booking to stay in a Shaftesbury hotel again if this is what they think of their customers.,1,2018,01,15
103,Indian afternoon tea ,"We had a indian afternoon tea with our daughter age three.  Before arriving I mentioned my daughter will be joining us and didn’t think any more of it.  Upon arrival they had arranged a meal for my daughter as well so she felt part of the experience.

During each course my daughter was also given milk, sandwich and chips and a mocktail which made her feel special and included in the meal. 

The food was amazing and above expectations. 

I would like to thank Alisa and Cestel for their amazing hospitality you went above and beyond my expectations.  I will defiantly be returning 

Thank you for making our afternoon tea a memorable one.",5,2018,01,15
103,Lovely Afternoon Tea,"I got bought a voucher for an afternoon tea here and it was lovely, the staff were so accommodating and lovely - we got special mocktails and the food was just beautiful. The only slight disappointment was the room they do the afternoon teas in - it is open and you have people walking through lugging their cases right behind you which does slightly take away from the peaceful and enjoyable experience an afternoon tea should be! Otherwise, a lovely experience.",4,2018,01,15
103,Indian afternoon tea,"It was a first class service, food was amazing, the setting and service was outstanding too. 
Alisa was the waitress who served us and helped me with the whole arrangements when I made the booking. 
We went as a group of 8 friends and our dietary requirements of Halal food and non alcoholic drinks (mocktails) were catered for. The masala chai was authentic and we had a selection of twining teas to choose from too.
We were even given a lounge room to perform our prayers. 
I’m definitely going back with friends and family.",5,2018,01,14
103,"Good location, great staff.","We stayed for two nights in December in the run up to Christmas. Staff were very polite and friendly throughout our stay. We thought we had a small issue with something  in our room, I  called the desk and someone was knocking on our door within minutes and the problem was resolved instantly. Brilliant location close to two tube stations but also good for walking to many sights. Breakfast was good, a nice variety and buffet style. Our room was on the top floor and quite small but fine for  a short stay. Not five stars as I think the stairways and hallways were looking a bit tired and needed a little update but other than that spot on. We would stay again and would recommend.",4,2018,01,14
103,Great location & friendly staff,Great location in central London. There is a Grocery store and a very good cosy cafe for breakfast right on the corner. There is also a small restaurant in the hotel where you can eat all day long. Rooms are clean and hotel staff is very helpful. ,4,2018,01,13
103,Small room,"Hotel centrally located, very close to Oxford Street and 5 minutes walk to nearest tube station. Staff very friendly and check in and check out efficient. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean. Room was over the road on the other side of the hotel. The room itself was marketed as a “deluxe double” and bearing in mind there was a cheaper option of a “compact double”, the room was tiny. It was generous to call the bed a double and 2 people hardly fit in it. There was no room to store any bags or do anything except edge around in the room and the TV was off to the side and not at the end of the bed. The room was also very cold even with the heating on full, however, it was well appointed and the shower and bathroom was good, but again bathroom far too small. Glad we were only staying 2 nights and probably on balance would not stay here again. We stayed in a Premier Inn the night before in Manchester and that far better at a fraction of the price. ",3,2018,01,13
103,Brilliant hotel,"Once you step in the hotel, you know what to expect. Very clean, very helpful and pleasant staff (Alrich, Kenith, Valentino). I was directed to my room by them. The room was spotlessly clean, very organised, and full of modern amenities. I checked out late, but they let me leave at my own convenience. I would definitely recommend this place and I will be surely going back!",5,2018,01,11
103,Cleanest Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In,"Have just returned form a short break in this hotel. Our room was a wonderful suite, all the mod cons, beautiful spacious shower room, the most comfortable bed ever, and spotlessly clean, and VERY quiet, could not fault it. Reception staff were very friendly, nothing was to much trouble. All in all perfect",5,2018,01,10
103,Indian inspired afternoon tea,"We went for an afternoon tea for two. The service from the waitresses was lovely. They were very friendly and kindly explained all the treats on offer for us. Also we liked the fact that the eating area for the guest having afternoon tea was very discreet and thus they could give us a lot of attention. 

Alisa was the waitress who served us...she was great. We will definitely go back to try the english traditional afternoon tea. :)",5,2018,01,09
103,Saved our holiday,"We had a double room in the basement of an adjacent building to the reception. It was small, but really cosy, clean and with neat features. You had dimmers both by the doors and by the bed, a flat screen tv, comfy bed, free water, a fridge and a really good shower. Only downside would be a loud ticking noise at night and that we couldn't figure out if the ceiling fan could be controlled (the suspected source of the sounds at night.) We had changed to this hotel during our stay in London because we got really unlucky with our first hotel, but Park Grand Paddington really saved our stay. The staff were all very lovely, efficient and let us just enjoy a wonderful, relaxing room.",5,2018,01,09
103,Amazing afternoon tea,"My friend and l decided to treat ourselves when we saw the wowcher deal but to be honest it was well worth the money even without the discount. The chai Marsala tea was beautiful, a bit unnerving at first to see the milk and tea come out of the pot at the same time but it tasted heavenly. There was a huge selection of Indian savories and sweet treats to try which we tried very hard but we sat and chatted all afternoon and the service was top notch and despite staying so long we were never made to feel in the way
i cannot fault anything about the experience. We will be back, voucher or not",5,2018,01,09
103,Budget hotel,"I was there last year 3rd Dec to 8th Dec .
Overall good hotel in terms of budget .Accommodation facility was excellent . Rooms are nice . Breakfast was good and perfect
Hotel stuffs are co-operative and smiley always . Hotel lobby has no enough space so but tough to spend lazy time .

Service need to improve . I was surprised when I knew they don’t provide water as complimentary.",3,2018,01,09
103,"Friendly, professional, helpful what more do you want","The rooms are well kept clean and comfortable.  The staff is amazing and at the reception people like Arnold K make the experience fantastic.  A staff that not only understand different cultures but a cultural staff that oozes class and sophistication.
Thank you Grand Park Paddington Court.",5,2018,01,08
103,A birthday break to remember!,"This was a one night trip from across the Irish Sea. Our small family of three visited on a whim for our young son's fourth birthday. We got a great deal online for this hotel and were not disappointed in any way.

First impressions were good as we arrived earlier than the 2pm check in time. We left our luggage in the concierge's hands and went walking through Hyde Park. Upon returning, the bags were brought out, without fuss, by a considerate young man called Andrew. He showed us to our room and all the in and outs of our double room.

Front desk staff were courteous and helpful, assisting with restaurant recommendations and activities to try.

Our room was large and spacious. We especially loved the little personal touch of a few balloons placed on the bed for our son's birthday. We stayed on the fourth floor, behind the lift, which was unbelievably quiet. We had fabulous amenities within the room, including tea and coffee facilities, fridge, room safe, plush white cotton robes, large HD TV and a bathroom with a heated floor. 

Our views were spectacular, but one drawback about the hotel was the draught coming from the windows. The windows are in bad need of modernisation, with heat escaping at will. Another thing we noticed, that while the room is large, there was very little counter-top space either in the room or the bathroom.

Other than those two small things, the beds were very comfortable and the room was impeccably clean. The staff were very welcoming and encouraged us to return for a longer trip next time.",4,2018,01,08
103,Nice hotel,"The room is clean and it was a pleasant stay. Also the convince of a tube station close to the hotel is nice.
But I find that there is a lack of shops and places to eat, near the hotel. Also the room included a TV. Which was great.",5,2018,01,08
103,Poor service and,"I stayed at this hotel for one night on a business trip. The room I stayed in was in the basement and the ventilation system was very noisy. The room itself was clean. When I returned home I noticed an error on my invoice and I contacted the hotel 4 times via email but received no reply. But I needed a correct invoice or I would not have been able to recover the fees for my stay from my company. I then wrote a TripAdvisor review.  After that was posted I finally received a correct invoice. I also received a call from the hotel asking me several times to please remove my review as it was very discouraging for the staff and the reason they didn´t reply was because they had issues with their system. If that is correct it seems their emails didn´t work for several weeks. I find that hard to believe. I replied that I would think about removing my review but since the service had been very poor I decided not to delete it. But then it seems the hotel asked TripAdvisor to remove the review claiming it was associated with the wrong hotel. 
If that is how the hotel management deals with complaints then this is very disappointing. Mistakes happen and they should learn from them and improve the service. Having negative reviews removed after acknowledging they were correct is no way of dealing with such a matter.",1,2018,01,08
103,Bit of a rabbit warren,"We were welcomed by a porter who came out to take our bags from us. We checked in and were taken to our room, which was a good thing because we would not have found it on our own.  In fact we did get lost trying to find Reception later when we went out.

Unfortunately we had to change rooms late in the due to water coming through the ceiling from the room upstairs onto the bed.

The staff were very apologetic - it wasn’t their fault - and found us an upgraded room in another part of the hotel/sister hotel about 200 yards round the corner.  

Again a bit of a rabbit warren but thankfully not as bad as previous. 

We didn’t eat there, albeit that we were offered a free breakfast to compensate for having to change rooms.

The decor is a little tired but the rooms were comfortable and clean and the staff dealt with the problem very professionally.",3,2018,01,07
103,Wonderful! ,"I stayed here for three nights, along with my mum for the start of our holiday. The staff are well trained and offer very polite and professional service, even showing you to your room and carrying your luggage. They also show you where everything is and take you through working the lights and other functions and connect to the wifi. The room was clean and modern, and although there wasn't much room around the bed it's enough space for whatever you need over a few days. ",5,2018,01,07
103,Indian afternoon tea ,"I choose Park Grand Paddington Court to celebrate our anniversary! We had an Indian afternoon tea and it was amazing. The staff was super kind and they even offered a bottle of Prosecco. I can’t remember the name of the two nice men assisting us, but they were gorgeous! They described everything we were going to eat and they did their best to make us feel good and enjoy! Congrats to the chef because the food was really good, spicy and with a very good taste...the tofu wrap and the scones were delicious! Thank you very much for the great experience. And a special thank to Alisa for organizing it! 
We’ll definitely have another one before we live. 
My suggestion is to try, you’ll be more than happy. ",5,2018,01,04
103,Amazing location and friendly staff,"I visited this hotel during my visit to London for an event. Surprisingly many people from my field were staying in this hotel making it feel like home. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms like what people told me about London were very small. This was a warning which everyone told me that rooms in London are very small. I opted for double bed room so that I get little big room. 

Breakfast at the hotel was very good. They served Indian food, making breakfast more enjoyable. Especially their masala chai. 

Location of the hotel is apt, near Paddington station and tube, so that traveling around London makes it easier. 

The hotel took special care for all their guest and made it feel like home! ",4,2018,01,04
103,Miss,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during Christmas holiday. My flight was delayed and after terrible day I arrived to hotel at midnight but thanks to the reception team for upgrading me to club room and giving me the nice room. Room was clean, quite and staff was friendly and helpful which made my stay pleasant.
Subway is just 5 minutes away which mean you don’t have to worry about transpiration and easy to commute to local markets.",5,2018,01,03
103,Great stay,"We stayed here for our family trip to Winter Wonderland before Christmas. Very easy to find, great value for money and perfect location near Hyde Park. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Alba! Thank you for making our trip so special.",5,2018,01,03
103,Good,"Doublebed was only 140cm wide. We asked twice another duvet and they promised it, but it never came. Couple of bugs in shower's floor. Room was quit small.  Area is nice, location is great. Metro stations such nearby.",3,2018,01,03
103,NEW YEARS BREAK,"This hotel is clean, comfortable. Good quality food. A good location. 
10 mins walk to the tube. 10 mins walk to Kensington palace and hyde park. 
Or just get a cab. 10 mins to Oxford street. Priced right. Ideal for groups visiting london. Enjoy this hotel. 
Staff are very helpful. ",5,2017,12,31
103,"Great Location, Good Hotel. Small Rooms.",We stayed between Christmas and New Year. Hotel is in a great location. Just a 5 minute walk to/from Paddington Station. Staff were very polite and friendly. We stayed in Room 322 which can only be reached by stairs. The room was decorated nicely and was equipped well with a huge TV and many multimedia things. The room itself was very small.,4,2017,12,31
103,Christmas visit,"First time staying at the Park Grand Paddington Court between Christmas and New Year. Very good location. Rooms are beautiful. Lovely hotel with excellent breakfast available. ALL staff were very pleasant and helpful but Fatma on reception was exceptional, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you Fatma! Highly recommend this hotel. Lots of restaurants in the area if you don’t eat in the hotel. ",5,2017,12,30
103,Excellent stay,"A really enjoyable stay, the staff were excellent and the room was great. Although we were situated in the basement opposite the reception, the room was very modern and had recently been upgraded. The bed, TV and shower were fantastic and the variable dimming lighting was impressive. We will definitely be back. ",5,2017,12,29
103,second time here and wont be the last time im sure!,"Perfect staff, Clean and quite rooms, they are always more than happy to serve me.
everything i needed they provided it for me.
the food as well is Delicious 

Special thanks to ( Fatma,Marian,Andrei) and everyone helped me and my trip perfect",5,2017,12,29
103,They try so hard...,"A friendly greeting and a complimentary upgrade starts things off well, but the room is directly opposite the staff entrance and the cigarette smoke blows under the door of the room. At six in the morning, when the staff collect outside your door, this is a big issue. Not pleasant at all. Other than that, for central London the price is good. The bed is, however, the smallest hotel bed I have ever seen and the duvet similarly Liliputian...for an upgrade, it felt like a downgrade. Breakfast is good, the staff uniformly excellent. A curate's egg of a stay...",3,2017,12,29
103,Afternoon Tea with Prisecco,What can I say ..... an absolutely fantastic afternoon tea and the customer service was exceptional. I got a deal from Groupon costing £58 for 4 adults and this included the most delicious afternoon tea and 2 bottles of Prosecco!  We were also celebrating my aunties birthday and the staff surprised her with some cake and a lovely rose at the end of the meal ( and sang happy birthday). We would definitely recommend and will visit again. Special thanks to Alisa which was exceptional and looked after our every need 😊. Created some special memories for us 😀.,5,2017,12,28
103,"Well located, Room was small","I stayed here with my son in late November for 2 nights.  The hotel is well located (5-10 minutes walk from Paddington Station), very close to Hyde Park and also to some nice pubs.  The room we were assigned (lower ground floor) was very small and we had to make a bit of an effort to get from one side of the bed to the other once we had got our 2 suitcases in.  The Reception and Restaurant staff were generally considerate and professional.  The shower did not drain properly in our room and I was a bit concerned about the bathroom flooding so reported it to Reception but I don't believe this was rectified before we left.  Despite a few inconveniences overall we did have a nice stay at this hotel. ",3,2017,12,26
103,Fabulous Stay at Park grand Padding ton Court Hotel.,"I never slept this well in a hotel bed, for starters! I still miss that bed.
My room was a Triple room one on the mezzanine floor, but brilliantly thought out, completely functionalist one. There was a natural place for everything and it never felt cramped.
The bathroom was perfectly laid out as well, toilet, sink, shower. Everything very clean and attractive.
Breakfast restaurant was really nice as well, and the breakfast that was included with my room was basic, but home-made and nourishing.
The staff was exceedingly friendly and efficient. I asked if I could please have baby cot which they managed well. So, what's not to like.
The neighborhood is largely residential and posh, but the street right behind the hotel,  leading up to Paddington Station, is a good one for a nightcap.",5,2017,12,26
103,Wonderful Experience...Great Hotel..,"I spent two nights here and i must say that everything was excellent. The room was Quite excellent, super clean nicely decorated and covered all needs, it was mostly comfortable. The entire staff displayed the utmost professionalism, friendly and hospitality from beginning to end.
     I would definitely return in future....Great Hotel.",5,2017,12,26
103,Indian inspired afternoon tea,"My friend and I booked an Indian inspired afternoon tea on wowcher with a bottle of prosecco included all for £29. All I can say was it was first class! The prosecco wasn't cheap it was very decent.The food was delicious and the staff Alisa and Claudia were so lovely. They couldn't do enough for us. They kept asking us if we wanted any more tea, coffee or hot chocolate .... we already had 2 top ups! Totally recommend this different kind of afternoon tea. The only thing, and this is being picky, that could be better is the seating. It seemed like we were on a corridor or walk through because people checking in the hotel were walking through the bar area with their cases. But it didn't really bother us too much",5,2017,12,22
103,I've stayed in London hotels at twice the price of this that were nowhere as good,"A very pleasant hotel. Excellent and friendly staff. The room was comfortable and a reasonable temperature (not the usual roasting hot). 

In many hotels, the room rate is just the start. They then try to get as much out of you as they can during your stay. I understand they are businesses, but it gets a bit tiresome. The Park Grand was very different. We had complimentary bottles of water, fruit and a half bottle of wine in our room. Possibly the room we'd booked but a nice touch. Free local and long distance calls through a smart phone docked in the room was another surprise.

We ate out so I can't comment on the food. All in all, a relaxing and enjoyable stay.",5,2017,12,18
103,A very pleasant stay,"We actually went to London to shop, so we dropped our luggage in the morning, which was looked after as rooms aren’t available until 2pm.
Once returning to the hotel, we were made to feel welcome and our luggage was with us immediately. In fact the porter took the luggage to the room.
We were pleasantly surprised how comfortable the rooms were, small but comfortable.
We had complimentary fruit and a small bottle of wine. We didn’t actually take them but they were there for us foc. Our friends took full advantage and rightly so if it’s there for the taking.
The shower room was clean and loved the underfloor heating, nice little extra.
Shower fab.
The breakfast in the morn8ng, was very nice...got to say you make a fabulous cup of tea! 
The staff both on reception and in the breakfast room were brilliant. Very helpful, friendly and kind.
For a night or a couple of nights stay I fully recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,17
103,Holiday ,"I stayed here for 10nights and I enjoyed every bit of it . On arrival my check In Was smooth and staff very friendly when I asked for a room at the top floor they gave me . Rooms very clean and bathrooms very modern , I like that the floors were heated in this crazy winter that helped alot. I had breakfast once and was impressed with the selection provided . Loved the bed it was so comfortable sleeping in it and that was good as I wanted a restful holiday . 
Very well located , close to train station and bus stops 
Will definitely stay here again . ",5,2017,12,16
103,Small room,"We booked this hotel based on its very favourable reviews. Maybe we just had bad luck. We had probably the smallest room we have ever stayed in. We literally couldn’t find anywhere to hang a coat and you could just about walk around the bed. The sheets didn’t fit the bed and the room had a smell as if someone had been smoking. So overall not a great stay for us. 
The location is great - and maybe we just had a bad experience, but we wouldn’t  return.",2,2017,12,13
103,Double upgrade to the basement,"An interesting hotel, spread over both sides of a street and across a number of upmarket renovated terrace houses. I was advised I had been given a double upgrade room, but it was on the ground floor. I said as long as it was not noisy it would be fine. Even the staff member taking me to the room got lost. Not accessible by lifts, it involved crossing the road from reception, and sidling down a stairway that would have not looked out of place in Paris or Amsterdam - bad luck if you are infirm or can't carry your suitcase out in front of you. The room itself was very nice, with light from not one but two stair wells. Breakfast next morning was back across the road and back down into a basement - not really ideal.",4,2017,12,13
103,An irritating stay at an odd hotel,"My stay started rather annoyingly as I showed up and was asked my name; I began spelling it but the wheels soon came off - I have an Irish last name which includes an apostrophe. The woman checking me in had no idea what an apostrophe is, and looked at me like I had two heads. Fine, whatever.

The hotel is laid out in a labyrinthine and illogical fashion. It's an old building and showing, and has series of stairways and narrow hallways all over the place. My room was 223, so I took the elevator to the second floor. Makes sense, right? Nope. Rooms on the second floor stop at 222. UNLESS, apparently, you take those stairs I mentioned, which go to an entirely separate part of the building with no connection to the lift area. This wasn't at all explained to me and when I inquired about it, and the lack of corresponding signage, again I was the one treated like I was strange. The manager reluctantly intimated I could stay in a lift accessible room if I ""needed"" one. I didn't; I would just prefer not to carry my heavy bag up and down numerous flights! 

The location of this hotel is fine; best I can say in that regard is that it's close by to Paddington so if you're traveling via that station it's convenient.

The room itself was also fine but nothing to write home about. Service is extremely lacking. Bar closes at 11 which is a shame - you'll feel like you need a drink after staying here",2,2017,12,12
103,Amazing Indian Afternoon Tea,"They are doing one of the best and amazing Indian Afternoon Tea here! A must-do thing! I totally loved it. Alisa was amazing. She gave us all the details about the available options. The food was yummy. Can’t put it in words, it’s an experience. Absolutely do it. ",5,2017,12,12
103,Very nice hotel ,Stayed here as it’s close to winter wonderland. Staff are really helpful and the rooms had just been renovated so we’re very nice and clean. We had a problem with the heating but staff came to fix the problem very quickly. Good price for the location and hotel itself ,4,2017,12,08
103,Chocolate Afternoon tea,i bought my daughter an afternoon tea from wowcher and was very pleased with our experience. we arrived early but they still let us come in. the staff were very attentive. we dont drink prosecco which was included in price so they offered us a mocktail. the staff found out it it was my daughters 16th birthday and unbeknownst to me bought her a surprise cake and candle and she was very happy. the food was delicious and the ambience was lovely. parking was free on a sunday a few metres away so it made everything a great experience.,4,2017,12,08
103,Lovely hotel ,"We has a great night's stay at this hotel.
Our room was lovely and clean
Fab location next to Paddington tube, we found it to be an ideal location as it was so easy to visit all the attraction London has to offer, especially for christmas shopping 
Will book again next time we are in London.  ",4,2017,12,06
103,R. Glasgow,"Another great stay. This hotel and its staff just continues to excell and impress me every visit. This time I had a club room-great value plus a huge comfortable bed. Zdravko, probably the ick tmost helpful concierge in London with Fatwa & Charley (reception desk) and Luann (customer relations) are the first class team of the Park Grand.
A special shout out to Desmond & Robey on the night crew on 14 November. On my way that early morning to catch the Eurostar to Paris I lost my phone which had my mobile boarding pass. These two were able to print out hard copies of my ticket and get me to my train on time. Saved the day for me! 
Always a pleasure to stay here, plus the tube convenience makes Paddington Court a must on my London visits.

",5,2017,12,05
103,Superb,"We stayed here on 27th Nov for 1 night and found the perfect place to stay near Marble Arch. Excellent value for this area, very clean, polite, helpful staff and a very well designed room. We couldn't fault anything. The room had a fridge, microwave, superb Tv and an excellent bed. Breakfast was ok, could do with more choice but it was included free. Overall this Hotel is highly recommend and I will definitely be back again. ",5,2017,12,05
103,Amazing afternoon tea,"We came here for the Indian afternoon tea, it has been one of the best afternoon tea I have ever been to. The service and the food was all amazing and we were really looked after through our experience.",5,2017,12,04
103,Wonderful stay,"We had an amazing stay with my boyfriend on July. Perfect location, just a few blocks from Paddington Station. Every one was friendly and the hotel is beautiful. We will come back to this hotel in our next visit to London for sure!!",5,2017,12,04
103,Nice Modern Room,"Positives: A very nice modern clean room with several nice touches such as USB points. Good Breakfast with nice options. OK locations

Cons: Check in was the slowest I have been involved in for ages. Green light in bedroom was annoying",4,2017,12,03
103,Good value property,"The hotel is located just a short walk from Paddington Station, however if arriving by tube the closest station is located on the Circle line. If you exit from the Hammersmith and city line or a circle line service to Hammersmith, that tube station is on the opposite side of Paddington station and is a good 15-20 minutes walk.  Change trains at Edgeware Road and travel one stop on the anti-clockwise circle line service.  I was a little early arriving however the receptionist advised that they had a room available if I didn’t mind a lower ground floor room. Check in was quick and I was informed that my room was located in building number three across the road. I was shown to to room by a member of staff . The room was located through a door under the staircase and down a pretty steep flight of stairs, however the building was well presented and all furnishings were modern. I was shown to room 561 which was quite small, however it contained all amenities and was modern and nicely decorated. The room also overlooked a small courtyard despite being lower ground. The bed (single) was extremely comfortable and the building was quiet. A good breakfast was served the following morning in the restaurant across the road in the main building. Great value at just £113.00 including VAT and full breakfast!",4,2017,12,03
103,Indian Afternoon Tea - Afternoon Tea staff excellent front desk staff not so much,"Was booked as a birthday present and have to say the food was excellent and very filling. The staff that looked after us for the tea itself were brilliant.

The only criticism was we were waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes when we arrived until I decided to explore where it was but that was down to the front desk and not the Afternoon tea staff.",4,2017,12,03
103,Indian afternoon tea,"The Indian afternoon tea here was delicious. They had a great range of snacks, sandwiches and desserts. We had a bottle of prosecco included in our offer and as it was my sister in laws birthday they surprised her with cake and lillies. Thank you to Claudia and Alisa for taking care of us and making this experience great for us.",5,2017,12,03
103,Lovely spacious room with big bed,"We stayed here to see a show in London The reception was friendly and helpful.  Our room was a spacious size with a large bed (6ft wide) with white cotton bed linen. The en-suite was modern with a wide shower both overhead and spray shower. The room facilities include small fridge, safe if you need one hairdryer and is air conditioned.  We had a room at the back of the building so no traffic noise where we were.  The breakfast was a choice of full English or continental both were good and you help yourself at a buffet for this and tea and coffee is served,  Overall it was what I would expect for 4* hotel",5,2017,12,01
103,You're amazing!!!,"I have stayed at the Park Grand Paddington Court for couple of months already and still staying, one thing I'd like to note would be that even if the borough is paying for my accommodation I have been treated as a regular guest and would want to express my gratitude and appreciation to the staff especially Dan, Fatma, Marian, Alice, Charlie, Florin,Dario, Grosvenor- Mr. Richard, Sorin (everyone in the hotel, with the above mentioned being most frequiently comunicated with)
The foundation of this hotel constructively produces the happines of the guest, whith the base for this being the staff itself. The housekeeping team are trustworthy since whatever is left in the room in terms of personal belongings is left untouched even though the room is being made up and they are like my mother and sisters taking care of my belongings...
I believe that this hotel is the main property within all the other ones around being part of the same group anyway, other sections should learn from this reception and their service.
I love them all, I've been dealt with respect and dignity and thank you very much for what you are doing.",5,2017,11,28
103,Weekend break,"Just returned from weekend trip to see christmas lights and hyde park winter wonderland,stayed here for 2 nights,perfect location for central London,Just a few minutes away from tube (Lancaster gate) and only couple of stops from Oxford circus,also easily accessible from kings cross station.
Hotel really clean,staff very friendly,breakfast perfectly fine.
Only criticism was that we were put in the annexe across the road and the room was tiny,but we only slept there so not a massive problem",4,2017,11,27
103,Nicest people,We stayed here while my mum was in hospital and we were really worried and having a tough time. The people were so so nice and went above and beyond for us time and time again. The guys I think they were called Dom and Maruan were super nice. They gave us a card but I can’t read their writing. Any way they were great and so considerate to our circumstances. Unfortunately my mother passed away as we would have loved to have taken her there another time. You won’t find nicer people in London. Thank you for everything.,5,2017,11,24
103,It was a délicieux stay,"Hey! It's not just a review but a hearty thanks to all of you at park grand Paddington hotel who took care of Us... 
Especially Fatma, Dan and Dario!!!!! ❤❤❤

103,"Comfortable stay, excellent customer service ","I stayed for one night as I was attending an event nearby.

Check in was quick and efficient and I was delighted to find out my room was upgraded to one of the newly refurbished Paddington Court Suites. 

My room was large, the bed was very comfortable and there was a power shower to wake me up in the morning! There were tea/coffee making facilities, toiletries etc. 

Breakfast was good, a small but perfectly adequate spread including an English breakfast. I was seated quickly.

The staff were all excellent and I was very impressed by everyone’s professionalism. 

I would be happy to stay here again and may well try one of the other nearby sister hotels.",4,2017,11,22
103,Afternoon Tea,we were greeted by Alisa Longreanu. She made us very welcome and got us seated offering us tea and coffee and also Masala chai. Soon after that this our afternoon tea was served.The selection we had was amazing and we have been to many afternoon teas   but this was special. The food was  fresh with a great selection of mainly Indian food...the lady who served us was Claudia Apostol and what amazing service. She couldn't do enough for us. We also had a visit from the Chef as well. He had prepared a super afternoon tea for us. I can recommendthis to,5,2017,11,22
103,Lovely memory in London ,"The hotel is near Paddington station, about 5 minutes walk, so it's easy to go to everywhere in London. The hotel is in white townhouse and the room inside looked elegant as well. All the members in the hotel are friendly and helpful, especially Marion and a very tall, black-hair boy in concierge. The price is also very reasonable, you can't find a better place in this price in London.  I hope I can visit it again in London.",5,2017,11,21
103,Grand by name Grand in nature,"I booked the Indian themed afternoon tea, easy to book.. Easy to find, lovely reception area, we were shown to our table by Steve, who along with Vitor and Alisa looked after us throughout. We have done afternoon tea in various locations but this is hands down outright the very best we have had. 
Lovely decor to sit in, I found that they do masala chai which was a dream. The food arrived and every detail was explained to us which was great. They kept our water and prosecco glasses topped up throughout. 
At no point were we rushed or made to feel to get a move on. 
The food was outstanding, the pakoras unbelievable and the dips were fab. My fav was an Indian style doughnut with a sort of custard, really really delicious. 
I can not thank Alisa, Steve and Vitor enough. We will definitely be back.",5,2017,11,18
103,"The best stay in London, fantastic staff and service",Our porter Marian was amazing. He made sure we were comfortable and all the services and amenities we needed. He should have a promotion as he was simply the best. Valent at the front desk tended to our every need and all the staff were just wonderful. The hotel was comfortable and the bed was sublime. The room had all the modern conveniences and every plug for power. The bonus was the free cell phone which was so handy for us to navigate and get around.,5,2017,11,17
103,Yummy Indian afternoon tea and great staff,"Yesterday I treated my friend to an Afternoon tea, Indian inspired. It was her Birthday and the staff picked on that, and surprised after the tea. Delicious food, which were different Indian treats, savoury and sweet , nice prosecco, staff were all the time attentive and refilling our glasses without being invasive. Mention the excellent Masala tea.
So after all this, they came with a little cake with a candle, singing Happy Birthday to her and a red rose. I never asked for it so it was such a nice surprise. Also as we have finished our prosecco bottle, we asked for 2 extra glasses, obviously we were expecting to be charge at least for this. We weren't... I mean how amazing the staff were, very rarely you find this kind of attention in London, where you pay for absolutely everything. Many many thanks to all your team!! They made it unforgettable.",5,2017,11,15
103,A good hotel close to Paddington station,"My husband and I stayed 4 nights in a Deluxe Double room on the 3rd floor (room 304).

The reception staff were very helpful and gave us a choice of the floor we would like to be on, which was appreciated.

The bedroom was a good size - enough space for the both of us and our luggage without feeling cramped. Comfortable bed. Smart decoration. The pot plant was a nice touch. The smartphone in the room with free internet and free local & international calls was useful. Nice bathroom though a little small. A quiet room.

The only minor problem with the bedroom was that the window was single-glazed and so let the cold in, and we couldn't get the air-con to blow warm air, so the room could be a little cold at times.

On our first night we ate at the hotel. The assorted vegetable kebabs were very tasty.

For breakfast there was a good choice of hot and cold options. The staff were friendly and attentive.

The location of the hotel is excellent - around 5 minutes to walk to Paddington station where as well as over-ground trains you can also get underground trains on the Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines.

Checkout was smooth, and they were asking each person whether they wanted their luggage stored, which was thoughtful. We left our suitcases at the hotel until mid-afternoon so that we could do some more sight-seeing before travelling home.

We would definitely stay here again. Having looked into a lot of other hotels before booking this one i feel that Park Grand Paddington Court is excellent value for money.",5,2017,11,14
103,Fantastic stay and excellent service! ,"Perfect place to stay in Paddington. I had such a great time during my 4 nights in Park Grand Paddington Court. Room was super clean, nice breakfast with varieties, and most importantly excellent service provided by super friendly staff. Big thanks to Dan & Charlie for helping me with some little things and details! 

",5,2017,11,14
103,Nice little hotel with very friendly staff,"It was pleasure staying in this historical hotel in central London.
The friendliness and support of the staff was perfect. Thanks a lot.
The rooms size could be a bit larger and are noisy if you stay close to the air condition.",4,2017,11,13
103,What an Indian experience in heart of London,"It was like drinking my mum's home made masala chai (Tea). We were celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary and it was such a superb venue. The tea room is cosy, the food is like home made and very fresh bursting with flavours. The time and effort the hotel is putting into this experience is credit to the staff with what a superb service from start to finish. My wife received special flowers and we were served with small celebrating cake, that we were not expecting. ""Guess what"" - we will be going back and telling everyone to try this something different then normal eating out experience - Very well done Park Grand Paddington Court.",5,2017,11,13
103,clean & welcoming,"Lovely and clean hotel; the breakfast was excellent;The receptionist 'Purbi' always remembered our name with a welcoming smile; We would use this hotel again when visiting London; The room was comfortable, but not large enough to sit around in, bed was soft and comfortable for a good nights sleep;",4,2017,11,13
103,"Great hotel, lovely staff!","Great and gorgeous hotel, with extremely helpful staff! Bit disappointed that there was no fridge in the room so had to keep my allergy-safe milk on the window sill outside the room, but bed was comfy and facilities are great! I love this chain :-) x",4,2017,11,11
103,Excellent Indian Afternoon Tea,"We have just had an ""Indian Afternoon tea"" at the Park Grand Paddington Court and the whole experience was first class. From the initial booking (taken by Alisa), the warm welcome in the restaurant to the excellent selection of Indian inspired food, we would thoroughly recommend this afternoon tea. Alisa and Claudia were very attentive and refilled our cups and glasses at every opportunity, nothing seemed too much trouble. 
Having experienced a number of afternoon teas in London, we would definitely rate this as one of the best.",5,2017,11,11
103,A fabulous afternoon tea!,We went to the Park Grand for an Indian afternoon tea and it was just superb right from the start. The tea room is nice and cosy with very comfy seats. We were well looked after by Alesia and Claudia who were incredibly attentive (hats off for great service). The food was spot on. Fresh and delicious with nice little twists to some of the dishes. Highly recommend and we can't wait to go there again.,5,2017,11,11

103,Great London break,"The Park Grand Paddington Court is in a good location, close to the tube and Kensington Gardens.  It has a variety of restaurants around about it.  The room was a good size and was spotlessly clean. It has everything you'd need for a stay away and the staff were very helpful.  We opted to pay for our breakfast whilst there and enjoyed a varied selection of cereal, fruit, tea/coffee and a full cooked breakfast.  There was something for everyone.  I had stayed there about 5 years previously when it has just been done up and the corridors are beginning to look a little scruffy but that's a very minor complaint in what was overall an extremely pleasant stay.",4,2017,11,10
103,"Great Staff, nice food.","I  would like to compliment your staff at the reception desk, restaurant, cleaning and the gentlemen that help you with your bags, particularly Marian Vavilov, they all made my stay quite comfortable! This hotel is within walking distance of Kensington Palace and Princess Diana’s memorial walk, such a lovely park. There are businesses nearby such as pharmacy, Western Union, grocery store, etc. It is a convenient place and close to the Paddington train station. I enjoyed the food at the restaurant.",5,2017,11,09
103,Amazing Indian Inspired Afternoon Tea,"The best experience I've had for afternoon tea so far! The service was outstanding and staff here were amazing, special thanks to ALISA & CLAUDIA, for making our experience unforgettable. They went above and beyond and really added a special touch to our time there and made us feel welcomed. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a twist on your afternoon tea, then this is your place to go.",5,2017,11,08
103,Afternoon Tea,"We had an enjoyable afternoon tea in this lovely hotel.

The staff were very attentive, Victor and Joy, both looking after us well.

We had a Groupon Voucher which includes a bottle of Prosecco.

 The sandwiches and cakes were fresh and tasty.",4,2017,11,08
103,Amazing location!,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Deluxe Double room for 4 nights and, although the rooms were small, they were efficiently designed and clean. I would happily stay here again should the opportunity present itself! The location was also ideal. There were loads of restaurants and a few quaint neighborhood pubs nearby. Hyde Park is just steps away. Also a very quick walk to Paddington Station which made travel throughout the London area a breeze. The breakfast was mediocre, but it was free and got us through our mornings. Overall, great stay with very few complaints.",5,2017,11,07
103,Indian Afternoon Tea,"My husband and I booked this afternoon tea as we love Indian food and were intreiged as to what you would get to eat and thought it would be a nice treat.
The food was just superb!! I can't describe the deserts, they were sublime, so unusual. Just wonderf.uk. But what made the experience even more memorable was the service. Claudia and Kesia were out waiters. They were all so knowledgeable and attentive. Just su h s fantastic experience. We are going to treat our children and friends to this tea as it's such incredible value. You must go.
",5,2017,11,06
103,INDIAN AFTERNOON TEA FOR TWO,"Just to let you know that the girl whose name was Claudia Alesia was very polite
and her service was excellent. I would recommend this high tead to my friends
and if there are any offers would like to know about them. The food was excellent.",5,2017,11,06
103,Indian afternoon tea,"The Indian afternoon tea was a great experience. The food was absolutely so lovely and very filling. We don't drink alcohol so we had an alternative mocktail which was very nice.
The staff were so very friendly and helpful. We had met Alesia and Claudia who were very helpful and guided us each way. We had a little toddler with us and Alesia and Claudia were very friendly towards her and even gave complimentary food for her.
It was a great experience, I would totally recommend and go there myself again. ",5,2017,11,05
103,Perfect hotel experience,"This is the second time we have stayed here and we were very pleased to be back. This hotel has perfect decor, perfect staff, perfect food and is in a perfect location. It's a ten minute walk from Paddington tube station, so it's perfect when traveling to various locations around the centre of town. The decor is modern and contempary, very clean and well kept. We ate breakfast each morning which was delightful, they offer an excellent well stocked buffet with a variety of choices to suit all tastes. We also ate dinner here on our first night as we arrived quite late and it was delicious, the room service was efficient and the food arrived piping hot. Last time I reviewed this place we had had a few minor issues with staff communicating, this time the staff we perfect, extremely attentive, knowledgable and helpful. You instantly receive a warm and friendly welcome and they make you feel that nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is very affordable especially for the heart of London. This hotel is fast becoming our favourite in London and we will definitely be back.",5,2017,11,05
103,Ok but wouldn't return!,We were very impressed when we arrived as the service was very attentive. The room was pleasant enough although the bathroom was very small with nowhere to place items or hang towels. The lights in the room would not switch off unless you completely removed the card to the power so had to use the bathroom in the dark to avoid waking each other. Very long queue to check out and despite having already paid the concierge refused to let us just hand in our key and said we would have to wait around until everyone had been served - very different to the service on our arrival! This hotel is in an ok location but we've stayed in other hotels for this price with a far better experience so we won't be returning.,3,2017,11,05
103,Excellaent Hotel,"A very nice, clean and good value for money hotel in Paddington area. Friendly staff. around 300 m from Paddington railway station (Heathrow Express Only central London station) , Lancaster Gate underground station (Central line) and Paddington underground station (District and Circle lines)",5,2017,11,04
103,Outstanding Staff and  a lovely stay,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. There was an initial problem with the size of our room (of my doing, not theirs) and the staff was quick to correct it.  Charlie worked fast and efficiently to find a room that would better meet our needs. He checked in with us later to make sure we were happy. It seemed to me that they have a strong commitment to customer satisfaction. Sebastian and the women at the desk and others were very helpful. Our room was very nice, although not very large, and was as up to date as it could be. There was even a small handheld ""tablet"" the size of an iPhone that gave us tourist information. I had never seen this in a hotel. The breakfast room was large yet the various sections made it seem more intimate. The meal offered a lot of variety. Although we didn't use the bar/tea room, it was a nice amenity. I loved the convenience of location near Paddington Station but the most extraordinary aspect was that every single member of the staff that we met was friendly, helpful, and smiled. That has to be part of a corporate culture.  What a pleasure to stay there !!",5,2017,11,03
103,Good Time in London and Park Grand Paddington Court,"We stayed in this hotel in October and we are very happy about it!!!
First of all for the employee Luanne, Charlie and Fatima very kind with us.
We will return back very soon!
Also the position is very good.",5,2017,11,02
103,Afternoon Tea With Prosecco,"I had booked an Indian afternoon tea for two with a bottle of Processo, what can I say, it was a FANTASTIC experience!!!

My friend Nadeem Ahmed has just released his new book called 'Doomed In Dubai', this was a perfect occasion to celebrate.  

The amount of food they give you was amazing, from samosa's, paneer rolls, sandwiches, scones, and a variety of desserts, and not forgetting the variety of tea (including masala tea) which is my all time favourite.  I was full to the max.

The service was OUTSTANDING, thank you Alisa, Claudia and Victor.  You guys were very professional, very accommodating, and very friendly.

I would highly recommend this place, and shall look forward to coming back very soon.

103,Centrally Located Between 3 Tube Stations,"As we needed to have a room for 3 guests we chose a Junior Suite . This room had a Double Bed & a Sofa Bed that was made up for our arrival. The room was of an adequate size even with the Sofa Bed made up.
The room had a storage space that included a Safe, Ironing Board & Iron, Fridge, Hair Dryer, Microwave & a Oil Heater.
The Air Conditioning worked well. 
The WiFi here was not up to what I had expected with a Hotel of this caliber, barely useful.",5,2017,10,30
103,Indian Afternoon tea ,"I came with my husband for the Indian afternoon tea, the ladies who served us were really lovely.

We really enjoyed our time, hopefully we will come again.  ",5,2017,10,29
103,Afternoon tea,"Had the best time yesterday, went to the park grand for an Indian inspired afternoon tea and it was amazing, we had our own private room. Joy who was looking after us was brilliant and very helpful he made the whole experience extra special. My mum had a great 70th birthday experience. 
I would definitely recommend it.
",5,2017,10,29
103,Excellent,"We loved our 2 nights stay with this hotel. Excellent customer service and attention to detail. I honestly couldn't fault it. 

We stayed in B15 which is a club room. It was more expensive than the 'basic' room but definitely worth it. The room had tasteful decor and was spacious. On the second night they had decorated the bed and bathroom with real flowers as you may have seen in other pictures.

A 5 min walk from Lancaster Gate tube and obviously a few minutes from Paddington station too.

Amazing. I want to go back already!",5,2017,10,29

I wish I was with her on her trip! Thank you from a Mom halfway around the world for providing such a wonderful place to stay.,5,2017,10,27

103,Great compact rooms for great price,"Was visiting friends in London this summer and was looking for a single hotel room and this place worked out great. Room was very compact- single bed with TV, wifi, and bathroom, and wardrobe. Although small, it was big enough for one person and was about as luxurious as a single person room could be! The cleaning service was great, they always did an excellent job. Hotel was in pretty good location- right next to Hyde Park and close walking distance to Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate station. Very much enjoyed my stay here. Would definitely recommend if traveling alone.",4,2017,10,26
103,What a welcome,"We were stopping in London for 3 days and wanted to stay around Lancaster gate for it's easy access to everywhere and chose the Park Grand.  When booking the hotel l put a comment that it was our 30th wedding anniversary.  Checkin was easy and welcoming.  When we walked into our room - wow!  The room was spacious but the surprise we got when we saw red rose petals all over our bed, on the dresser and in the bath and sink, topped off with some beautiful cakes.  A lovely touch which created a great first impression.  The room was great with a very comfortable spacious bed,  The breakfast provided a wide choice, there was a small bar and staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Would certainly stay here again.",4,2017,10,25
103,Indian Afternoon Tea,"Me and 5 other family members attended for the Indian Afternoon Tea. 

Such outstanding food and hospitality.

The food was amazing and so well thought out. Hats off to the chef who has done an incredible job. 

Everyone was jealous of the picture so showed them.

Alisa, Steve and Joy made the afternoon so special with their attentiveness and friendly approach.

Highly recommend an unique Afternoon tea with a fabulous team to make it more special.  ",4,2017,10,24
103,Regular Booker,"Great location, being very close to Lancaster Gate or Queensway tube stations. Also within easy walking distance to Hyde Park, Marble Arch Genuinely friendly staff, who are always on hand to help with a nice smile. Well finished rooms. I could go on.",5,2017,10,24

103,Tea with a twist,"With Diwali having finished earlier in the week we decided to keep the celebrations going with indian afternoon tea at the Park Grand.  The food was lovely and certainly provided some new ideas on some original classics such as tandoori chicken sandwiches and sultana spiced scones.  The overall experience was first rate and the staff took great care of all of us topping us up with prosecco, teas and coffee.  Thoroughly enjoyable day which I would strongly recommend. ",5,2017,10,23
103,Location location location,"It's my second time at park grand Paddington court London and I booked a club room  . I must say this hotel needs a 5 star rating .....simply Amazing - they even provide you with a I phone which allows you free international roaming and local calls - and internet that is invaluable as I always get confused so Google maps can be accessed . The bedding is so comfortable as you lay your head you fall asleep ..... The bathroom have heating on the floor  so on a cold day it's  just the thing you need . The rooms are refurbished and ultra modern The phenomenal and go out of your way to make your stay absolutely comfortable . From the concierge Florin / Marian / zdravko  - assist you with every possible assistance you need . The reception - Alice and fatema are so pleasant and helpful it's beyond words . And Alisa from the breakfast  magnifique ! 

Best is the location - from Lancaster gate 5 min brisk walk and central line direct to Oxford Street ( just three stops ) 

Also there is Paddington station which is closer but i never went via Paddington ...was happy traveling thru Lancaster buses and train . 

In London I will always stay in the park grand hotel group - simply phenomenal they are ! ",5,2017,10,22
103,Best customer service ever!!!!,The hotel in itself is great but the concierge Mr. Alrich made it awesome!!! He took the time to show us the room and when we inquired about a different view he promptly took us to another one so we could choose. He explained everything about the room and even advised us where to go and what to see! The hotel manager should know that just because of him we will recommend this place to our friends and family and we will definitely be coming back just because of the great welcoming service. Thanks Mr. Alrich for going above and beyond! ,5,2017,10,21
103,Dr,"Fabulous hotel with a great location and a welcoming staff especially mr Johnny he was very polite ، delicious breakfast and comfortable rooms witch was very luxurious , there’s a cool feature thats called handy phone it has unlimited uk and international calls.

103,Nice stay,"We stopped here for one night after flying overseas. The location is close to Paddington station, which is easily accessible from Heathrow. The staff was very polite and helpful. Room was clean and comfortable for the two of us. We would happily stay here again. ",5,2017,10,18
103,Wonderful service from Luanne reception supervisor ,"To Luanne, the reception supervisor:
I want to say “thank you” to Luanne for having a wonderful visit in your hotel. Thanks to her, my experience in your hotel, which started in a not very pleasant way though, turned out to be such a big part of my unforgettable stay in London. 
I made a wrong reservation and it came out to be a very small room. I wanted to leave the hotel to another one. But Luanne checked with the manager so many times back and forth until she saw that I was satisfied. I felt not only her professionalism for a customer, but also the caring and respect for a person from her. It really warmed my heart. 
Due to her amazing service, I would definitely choose your hotel every time I come back to London. ",5,2017,10,18
103,Indian Afternoon Tea,"We had a lovely Indian afternoon tea at the restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. We were very well looked after and we had an enjoyable time.
 
The masala tea was very authentic.",5,2017,10,17
103,Well presented,"Stayed for a short visit meeting friends and before a flight the next day, ideal for Heathrow express. Though the room wasn’t ready Alba, behind reception with a big smile couldn’t apologise enough,  very friendly staff, were also very attentive room was a big surprise very clean with some nice little touches, tea coffe fruit wine etc the management should be proud of their staff, breakfast in the morning was absolutely fantastic buffet with multi choice from fruit cold meats pastries or a full English I will definitely use this hotel on my next visit to London, once again well done 👍",4,2017,10,17
103,Afternoon tea,"I took my friend for an Indian inspired afternoon tea for her birthday. We didn't know what to expect and were pleasantly surprised by its content! The staff were impeccable with their service, from greeting us right through to the end. They also brought a little cake out with a candle for my friend which we thought was a really personal touch!",4,2017,10,16
103,"the service was very good, the stuff was very polite and very cooperative","the location is  good, in the center, two underground station, minutes from hyde park,
30 minutes from oxford street, near the museums, the area is nice and quiet, breakfast is good, the service is very good.",5,2017,10,14
103,Enough for a quick stay,"This hotel is very well located, near Paddington Station and Hyde Park. If you like to walk you can go to several places walking - and come back by tube!
Very simple, and very small room. Almost haven't space for luggage. It has some ammenities, and you have a refrigerator. So you can get some food outside and take to the room! Enough for a 3 nights stay solo.",3,2017,10,12
103,The best service in a hotel and great location ,"The room service is great, the people who work especially the reception here is very welcoming and very helpful. A special mention to Alrich of the night staff who is very helpful. Located in a great location with underground very closeby. Hyde park and paddington station just 5 minutes away.  Definitely coming back next time.",5,2017,10,12
103,Awesome! ,I've spent three nights here. I felt very well taken care of. Very good service and always nice people greeting you and helping you out. I had some problems with my booking but they helped me out and made our stay splendid! Thanks to Charlie in the reception. The rooms are clean and perfect size for two people. It was not far from Kensington gardens and hyde park. And it took only 30 min to walk to Oxford street. And only 7 min to Paddington station. I would definitly live here again! ,5,2017,10,12
103,Great hotel with a close knit staff,Great 4 star hotel with a close knit staff striving to make the place feel like a 5 star. There are odd stairwells so this isn't the place for people with mobility issues. They have a sister property across the street which may be slightly less expensive.,5,2017,10,12
103,Lovely stay,Spent a night at the hotel with my daughter.  The room we had was extremely comfortable and very quiet.  All the staff that we spoke to were very helpful and we really appreciated the upgrade of room on arrival.  Excellent breakfast included in the price we paid.  Will definitely stay again when visiting London.,5,2017,10,12
103,"Great hotel, very friendly staff","The hotel was great! Very clean and cozy, the staff was really nice and helpful. The location was great and very close to Soho. Whenever I will return to London I will stay in this hotel. I definitely recommend to check it out.",5,2017,10,12
103,Excellent Experience!,"The service was excellent. 
The receptionist (Charlie) who helped me check in was very nice and warm. (He remembered me and came greeting me again when I was about to leave)
The room looks modern and luxury, the bed was really comfy and the wifi is fast and useful.
The microwave in the room was really helpful too!",5,2017,10,10
103,Another great stay!,"Once again a very nice stay at a club room at Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel. 
The rooms are nice, clean and welcoming. And if you chose a club room you get a fairly spacious room with extra luxury, but still within reasonable price.
Location is (still) in walking distance from Hyde Park (5 min), Notting Hill (15 min) and Marple Arch/Oxford Street (15 min)
I can only recommend this hotel, and can't wait to get back!",5,2017,10,10
103,Fabulous stay!,"Friendly helpful staff, great rooms with all amenities, free wifi and beautiful hotel. Oh great location too- walking distance to Hyde park, bus & tube stations. Cute area with easy access to shops & restaurants. Definitely recommend ! ",5,2017,10,10
103,Fabulous Hotel,Only needed one night stay in London close to Paddington Station. This hotel is a fabulous choice. Location is great. Only a short walk from the station and close to Kensington and Hyde Parks with great shopping and restaurants nearby. . Service really helpful. We were made to feel very welcome. Room was comfortable and clean. Would definitely recommend the Park Grand Paddington Court.,5,2017,10,10
103,Excellent value for such a good quality hotel.,"We managed a great last minute deal in a Club suite, the service on arrival was excellent and the room was very big with fruit, chocolates, water, tea and coffee and a bottle of complimentary wine. The bed was big and comfy, large tv, desk, wardrobe, everything you would need. The bathroom is a wet room and is starting to look like it needs a touch up as the silicon sealer around the shower head and tiling joints is beginning to peel away. The view from our room was the road and a similar building opposite but it was quiet and leafy with a little park adjacent. Perfect for Paddington stations and exploring London.",5,2017,10,10
103,Wonderful !,"Great hotel, great location. Just a few minutes walking from the tube, paddington station and 
Hyde park. Awesome staff! 
Many thanks to florin and mariam which made my vacation absolutely perfect.
See you again soon! 🖒

103,Amazing citytrip,"Very nice hotel. Good and friendly service, especially Sebastian and Purbasha. 
Fresh products at breakfast. Rooms are small but luxurious. If you have a question about London or transport, you get honest help.",5,2017,10,07
103,Perfect !!!,"The service was absolutely fantastic!! Couldn't ask for more all the staff went beyond their way to make my stay a fabulous.  Zdravko was very very helpful. the hotel is very well located to all the neccerties. The rooms were very well cleaned. I would definately reccommend the hotel and will most certainty come back to the Park Grand Paddington Court. 
Once again thanks to Zdravko you're the best!",5,2017,10,05
103,Great experience at Park Grand Paddington Court hotel,"The Park Grand Paddington Court si a great hotel with an excellent location, very clean and modern.
The Staff was attentive and pleasant and, especially Alice, was very friendly and helpful.
I have been in this hotel several times already, and I will certainly return without hesitation in the future.

103,Good solid hotel!,"I enjoyed my stay here at this centrally located hotel, only steps from Paddington.  The rooms are small but nicely appointed.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is adequate and I found the wait staff very pleasant and attentive.  I would stay at this hotel again without any problem. ",4,2017,10,04
103,Indian Afternoon Tea,"We had the most amazing Indian Afternoon Tea.  The tea/food and service was excellent, could not fault in any way.  We were given fresh cups and hot tea at regular intervals which was really nice.  The food was delicious and plenty.  The service was really good.  We were looked after so well, am already planning my next Afternoon Tea...",5,2017,10,03
103,Indian afternoon tea - quality food and great service,"This would have been a five star afternoon tea review, but for the slightly odd seating arrangements - see below.
But - the best bits - there was a very wide selection of Indian ""nibbles"", together with the traditional scones, cream and jam. The tea selection was very good - and no limits to the amount - we also had a bottle of prosecco with our deal.
Claudia, our hostess, was superb - really friendly and nothing was too much trouble for her - many thanks again!
Only let down was the location, in that you are effectively right next to the open walkway that leads to the main hotel bedrooms. This means that the area gets used as a waiting room for people whose rooms are not yet available and so it's never going to feel in any sense cosy or romantic. 
That being said I wouldn't want to put anyone off given the quality of the overall experience",4,2017,10,01
103,great hotel,"hotel in a great position, less than 10 mins walk to Paddington station and approx. 20 mins walk to Kensington palace.  Staff are amazing, so friendly and couldn't do enough for you.  the little extra's in your room, fruit, biscuits, tea and coffee make the hotel stay some much more personal, great touches.  we had a triple room, good enough size for 3 people, would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2017,09,29
103,Excellent attentive and efficient staff,"Great staff - could not be more helpful and always available. Most anxious to please and very efficient - a rare commodity in London.

Room well appointed with high class fittings and although a Club Room (larger) I would not have liked a smaller room

Very comfortable bed.",5,2017,09,29
103,Great service,I'd booked into a sister hotel but due to a boiler problem I got relocated. The initial room I was given was a basement single room. It was lively and clean but tiny. I phoned reception and asked if I could pay for an  upgrade for my second night. I was delighted when Rodney and Charlie said they would upgrade me immediately at no extra cost. Charming and courteous service.,5,2017,09,28
103,Terrific Location and Great Service,"This B&B is located within 10 minutes walk of Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations.  From Paddington station you can also board Great Western Railroad, Virgin Rail and other cross-country railways.  The Heathrow Express runs to and from Paddington Station for a quick 21 minute or less trip to/from Heathrow.  You will never run out of places to eat, drink beer, ale or coffee - all within short walking distance from the Park Grand Paddington Court.  Inside the B&B the two rooms we stayed in were quite comfortable (we stayed 9 days, went touring other England cities, then came back for 2 more days), if a bit cramped, but all the necessary equipment (A/C, in-room coffee/tea, safe, WiFi, fridge, etc) were present and WORKING!  The room was left nice and clean every day, so it was a great place to return to after a long day's rubbernecking and walking.  If you need help finding something, or some place, or just getting your smart phone connected to their WiFi, look for Alrich - he'll set you right up!  All in all, a satisfying experience.  We didn't take the breakfast option (GBP11 per person) as it was a bit on the high side and locks you into eating in the same place each time.  As mentioned above, there are lots of eateries and coffee shops around that want your business.",4,2017,09,28
103,Mother - Daughter Bonding; Disappointing Stay,"Other than the location - nothing else is great at this hotel. Service is very poor - or should I say almost no service.  Other than the bellman who checked us in, every one else was no good.  We asked for bottled water on our 2nd day, and when I called Housekeeping - the staff answered 'Yes?' Wow - is this how they answer calls? Was told that water is only on request.  Really? 
On our 2nd day, asked for an umbrella at the Front Desk - was nicely told that they do not have an umbrella but I can just buy it at a nearby souvenir shop (there is quite a lot of them). 
We are still here for another day and if I did not prepay the 4 day stay, I would have checked out sooner. I will definitely look at other hotels in the area. Hilton Paddington is closer to the bus and tube. There are also other similar type of hotels for at least 60-80 pounds less a night. It was a disappointment",2,2017,09,28
103,Outstanding Customer Services ,"The Park Grand Paddington Court provided my wife and I a great time. It is conveniently located and offers a range of amenities, particularly its available free smartphone, Handy, that provided maps, Internet service and free local and international phone service. 

But the main thing I wanted to emphasize was its customer service. My wedding band somehow became dislodged from my finger and I did not notice it until I returned to the U.S. I was devastated, but within hours I was contacted by the Reception Supervisor, Luanne D., that the ring had been found. I promptly called her and she cut through a ‘paperwork issue ‘ and personally ensured that my ring would be mailed out to me. I patiently await its return. 

I can not express my appreciation enough to Luanne and the Park Grand Paddington for its exemplary customer service and outreach efforts to serve customers. ",5,2017,09,27
103,Delightful discovery in Paddington,"Wonderful hotel on a quiet street steps from Paddington Station, Hyde Park, and, via Tube and bus, all the wonders of London. The rooms are on the small side, but the bed is comfortable, the WiFi reliable, and the hot water plentiful. Staff is friendly and eager to offer suggestions and help. I'd stay there again.",4,2017,09,26
103,Excellence close to Paddington!!,"What a fabulous place!

Stayed for 2 nights to visit the V&A. The hotel is quirky because of the row of properties that have been combined to create this hotel. Excellent service from the moment you arrive, concierge and reception teams really make you feel welcome. Our room was compact due to the building shape, however cleanliness throughout the hotel was excellent. The rooms decor was stylish and contemporary. The small bathroom was luxurious- best hotel shower I have used! 

The hotel is a short walk from Paddington station and benefits from being close to bars, restaurants and convenience shops. 3 or 4 Tube stations are within a short walk, there are even a batch of the London Santander cycles outside the hotel.

Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens are close by and it is a lovely walk through the parks to the Royal Albert Hall and all the major museums.

Had a fantastic stay and we will be back!",5,2017,09,25
103,"Indian afternoon tea with prosecco, using a living social voucher","We enjoyed a very pleasant afternoon. The Indian food was delicious and presented beautifully. There were a couple of hitches in that we didn't like the recommended choice of tea, and one of the sandwich selections was a bit dry, but these were rectified without question. Our waitress was helpful and charming, and when she realised it was my birthday arranged for an extra chocolate cake and candle, which was a nice touch. As we were the only party in the restaurant there was no pressure to leave, just lots of good service.",4,2017,09,25
103,"Great location, friendly staff!","I came here for businesstrip. Really friendly and helpfull staff. Alrich the night staff helped me check in and find a great room for me. Very clean and nice room. I definetly come back! 10/10. 
Acces to the gym. Paddington station 4 min walk. Great breakfast! ",5,2017,09,24
103,A nice reasonably priced hotel.,"Very clean, small but decent room and bath, pleasant staff, in a good neighborhood. Had lift, restaurant and bar. Close to pubs, bus lines, the tube.  Beds were comfortable, bath very modern. A good value for the money.",4,2017,09,20
103,Horrific,"on Monday we arrived to be told we had to pay again despite work already paying we were the made to wait at reception till 11pm for our rooms to be allocated. We were lucky at first we were all in the main building but witnessed many people being sent out in the rain to other rooms, and coming back as not suitable. When we were allocated rooms we were asked for an additional admin fee of £20 each, we all refused to pay that. We were not made to feel comfortable whilst we waited, even though we found out later there was a lounge available. Rooms EXTREEMLY small all small singles, ok to swing a cat as they say as long as it was a Manx cat. 1 room EXTREEMLY dusty, 1 room had large slog of blood on the wall no attempts at cleaning, 1 had no electric no plug points working, that colleague  at midnight was moved out in the rain and across the road to another room but the phone did not work there. He had an unexpected pair of visitors 45 mins later, a member of staff plus lady friend let themselves in to what they expected to be an empty room, I could carry on but they are just not worth it except to mention the filthy look given to my boss when she dared to ask at breakfast for coffee. Customer service -10, rooms -10, friendly greeting -10. Do not bother asking how much as it would not be worth it even if the paid you to stay",1,2017,09,20
103,Radio 2 Hyde park,"Great  modern hotel breakfast was great 
Bed was really comfy
Close to Hyde park tubes, cafes and bars 
Would definitely recommend and stay again 
Booked with getaroom.com American but about £100 cheaper than U.K. Sites 
",5,2017,09,20
103,Afternoon Tea,"A really 1st Class Indian afternoon tea. We were a little unsure what to expect, we have had numerous traditional afternoon teas, but chose this because it was different. A great choice it was superb, the staff were lovely and attentive & could not have been more welcoming.",5,2017,09,20
103,Afternoon Indian tea at Park Grand Paddington,"We were celebrating my birthday with a afternoon tea.The food was fusion of
Indian and English and of good quality.The service was attentive and were looked after by Claudia.Overall we enjoyed the afternoon and ended with small birthday cake.Recommend this afternoon tea with masala tea.",4,2017,09,18
103,Amazing place to stay! ,"Stayed for 3 nights with my partner and really enjoyed our time there. Upon arrival, we were early and they put our room in priority and we managed to check in around 12pm, which was highly appreciated. Clean and modern room,with all necessary facilities anyone needs in every day life. 

Not many cool or unique restaurants and cafes in the area but Paddington is less than 10' tube ride away, so, really, go eat in central. 

All the staff members were smiling and courteous and helped us during our stay, especially Sebastian. 

Highly recommend for a small and affordable boutique hotel near central London. ",5,2017,09,18
103,Not enough chiefs...,"We had booked a Club room and it was very comfortable and clean, albeit rather small.
There were a lot of young staff around and although extremely pleasant, they seemed to be a bit clueless. Reception took ages and when there was a problem with our phone, they promised to send someone but then, seemingly, forgot.
Still, they were all so nice it was easy to forgive them.
They would definitely benefit from some proper training, though, and better management.",3,2017,09,18
103,Amazing Weekend Birthday Break,"Well what a fantastic stay! Luanne, the reception supervisor on arrival, really went above and beyond! The service was exceptional from beginning to end with a birthday surprise along the way. Clean rooms, excellent customer service, would recommend and will stay again!",5,2017,09,17
103,Perfect but small ,"I stayed for three nights. The location was perfect, close to Paddington station and within walking distance of restaurants and bars if you don't feel like going too far away. The room and bathroom was clean and had a decent hair dryer which is always a plus. They also provided the room a few hours earlier than I was expected to check in. 

The downside is the size of the room, barely enough space for two people but this is average for hotels in London. The bed was more like a large single bet than a double. I'd say it's fine for a couple but would definitely recommend a larger room if you were bringing children or are going with friends. There was also no clothes iron.

I didn't eat go for breakfast because of the lack of vegetarian options available, the bar also closes early but staff are happy enough to bring bar service to the bedroom. The staff were polite but not overly interactive, many passed you in the hall but didn't take notice or greet you. The man who carries your bags was a bit off, approached me in the queue for the restroom and asked what I wanted and that said he had to go do something? Other than that staff were friendly overall. 

Enjoyable stay, wasn't blown away but all in all the hotel served its purpose providing a cleanly room in a good location so you can make the most out of your trip. ",4,2017,09,16
103,Nice option near Paddington Train,"We booked a Club Room, and it was very attractive and comfortable, although quite small. We had expected Club amenities similar to those at other fine hotels, but there was no actual Club Lounge or amenities such as afternoon tea or drinks, and the Club items in the room were a small bottle of unexceptional merlot, a small plate of fruit, two bottles of water and two bottles of soda.  The coffee service was a hotpot with instant coffee and Tetley tea bags. The bathroom amenities did not include body lotion, usually standard, but there was a very nice robe provided.  The internet accessibility was very difficult to obtain, even with the assistance of the IT aide. The included breakfast was very pedestrian in quality. I would not choose it again. The front desk staff attempted to be helpful and was very polite. If this hotel wants to compete, it should upgrade its Club Service, add a Nepresso or other capsule coffee machine, provide quality tea, expand its amenities selection, and upgrade the internet.",3,2017,09,15
103,Perfect Location for theatre and exhibitions.,"We had a lovely stay at the Park Grand Paddington. Room was small but perfectly proportioned and fitted out with all necessary ( and more ) accoutrements including a small fridge.
We were especially knocked out that staff had noticed it was close to my husband's birthday (the reason we were visiting London) and sent across lovely goodies to eat and snuggly white robes and slippers and a bottle of wine, a delightful surprise. 😊.
Breakfasts were served over a very long period, so no rushing around each morning and the buffet had a wide ranging menu of quality hot and cold food.
All in all a delightful stay and very conveniently placed for our visits to exhibitions (on foot)and the theatre (by tube) being near to Paddington Station and Hyde Park.
We will definitely book again when we next visit London.",5,2017,09,14

103,"Lovely stay, friendly staff","I stayed at this hotel for a two night break with my 8 year old son. We both thoroughly enjoyed our time and was both made feel very welcome by the staff (especially Sara). It's in a great location, right near Paddington, so was perfect for us with suitcases etc. The room was quite small but very modern, clean, practical and most importantly quiet! The free breakfast was a nice bonus as was the late checkout time.

We will definitely stay again and would highly recommend!",5,2017,09,12
103,Delicious Indian-themed afternoon tea,"We came for the Wowcher offer of Indian-themed afternoon tea for two with a bottle of Prosecco for the stunning bargain price of £29. It was a delight. The two girls who served us were charming and efficient, one offering to take our photo twice! 
Being given iced water when we sat down was a nice touch!
The choice of beverages was excellent and we very much enjoyed the chai (and the Prosecco, beautifully and expertly poured out and garnished with a strawberry) and the coffee served at the end.
The food was delicious and more than adequate in quantity. The only component we weren't that keen on was the rose-flavoured dessert pot. The tamarind and the mint sauces for the pakoras were excellent; indeed all the savoury bites were delicious, subtly spiced with lots of different textures.
The amount of clotted cream for the spiced scones was just right, a generous portion that allowed us to feel very indulgent! An interesting fusion of traditional English and Asian.
Altogether we enjoyed our experience, which lasted an hour and three quarters, very much.
I was puzzled not to be able to find any reference to afternoon tea on the hotel's website. It deserves greater publicity!",5,2017,09,12
103,Nice hotel!,"We stayed in for 6 nights. We had a double deluxe room. It was tiny and we felt it difficult to move inside with our luggages.
Most grateful to Fatma at the front desk who was very kind and cooperative with suggesting an upgrade but we had already unpacked and we estimated it would be a waiste of time to change rooms since we were spending most of our stay out of the hotel. Staff is friendly, a special thanks to Dan who was very helpful and kind. The hotel is calm, located in a pratical area, near paddington station where we can use underground and Heathrow express (direct line to heathrow airport). Pharmacy, shops and minimarket are situated right near. With less than 3 min walking distance, we reach a variety of cafes, restaurants, exchange offices... 5 min walk to big bus stop (hop on hop off tour). ",4,2017,09,09
103,Modern hotel rooms in central location; Small rooms but great value.,"I've stayed at this hotel a few times as it's good value for money. The rooms are very small, but the bed is comfortable and the rooms and en-suite bathrooms are clean and modern. There is complementary fruit and a bottle of water in the room when you arrive which is a nice touch. Bathrooms are modern, very clean and water pressure is good. 
Staff are friendly and efficient. 
Breakfast is very good. 
Rooms can be quite a distance from the front desk over stairs etc., so worth keeping this in mind if this will present a difficulty. Staff are always willing to carry your bags to the room. 
I'd highly recommend his hotel.",5,2017,09,09
103,Small rooms however location made up for it!,"Well presented hotel! Actually had a double bed as opposed to two singles pushed together (which occurs a lot in Europe). Room was tiny with only just enough room for double bed, difficult to maneuver around with two backpacks thrown into the mix. In saying that though it was fine for us as we were out of the hotel for the majority of the day and only really slept there! Bathroom was modern, clean and had good water pressure! Was located close to paddington station/Heathrow express (5mins) and walking distance to heaps of cafes and restaurants. Also only a 5 min walk to closest big bus (hop on hop off tour) stop.",3,2017,09,04
103,Stay at Paddington Court Exec Suites,"I stay in this hotel every year and every year Im blown away by the staff and friendliness.

103,"Indian Afternoon Tea - Wow, what a delight!","I took my family here as part of my mum's birthday present and we absolutely loved it!!!!
From when i first contacted the venue to book, Alisa was amazing, making sure all dietary requirements were going to be met. Then we arrived and met Joy. Initially we were seated inside and I didn't like it, the setting is in the lounge of the hotel where guests are able to have a seat, it didn't feel right, so when Joy suggested outside we jumped at the chance. He looked after us and was just so so nice and explained all the food. Oh my God, the food was so delicious. I've been to a few high tea places and this one beats them all, hands down. It was absolutely delicious. Thanks Park Grand for being innovative enough to do this! fanstastic food and fantastic service - we all had such a great afternoon!",5,2017,09,01
103,Afternoon tea ,Excellent customer service especially by Claudia. The Indian afternoon tea is delicious and all staff were polite and friendly. Really enjoyed our afternoon here! The mix between East and West is really good and we particularly enjoyed the mini desserts. ,5,2017,08,31
103,Good location excellent service,"Location of hotel is quiet good.. Very close to Paddington  station with all the train connections . Located in area that is not noisy but good transport connections .
Got free upgrade to club room. Nice and friendly reception. Got a call from front desk in my room soon after I went in- to find out if everything was okay . Joked that all was okay except I could not find the free bottle of wine . Surprise - a bottle of wine and box of chocolate sent with a complimentary note to my room.
Nice room, friendly and helpful staff. Nice  buffet breakfast .
After check out at noon , front desk cheerfully  accepted to  keep my luggage till the evening . This allowed me to do other things in other places  in London without having to drag my luggage around.
Stayed one night . Nice hotel.",4,2017,08,30
103,Comfortable stay,"We had an excellent stay at this hotel. Staffs were very helpful. Fatima the receptionist was very good .Room was small and clean. We had the deluxe double, my daughters had the standard double which were very small. Breakfast was full English and continental .Not a lot for dietary need. Had gluten free bread but no cereal on our first morning even though we did let the hotel know one guest is gluten free. They did provide it on the second morning, but only one selection  muesli . Did not eat at the hotel, the menu was poor not a lot of selection.",4,2017,08,30
103,"Fantastic Location to Oxford Street, Hyde Park and central locations. ","My sister and I went shopping in Oxford Street which was a 15 minute walk away. We visited the Shard using a voucher and a speed boat trip on the Themes, great prices. 
The rooms were very clean, spacious, and comfortable. 
The staff were impeccably dressed and very accommodating, nothing too much to help their guests. Breakfast was fresh fruit, yoghurt full English breakfast and lots of beverages to chose from. 
I would go again, very enjoyable hotel. Recommend. ",5,2017,08,29
103,"Delightful Indian afternoon tea, the best afternoon tea ever with prop masala chai!","We visited this hotel for the special offer they have on their Indian Afternoon Tea.
My son any myself enjoyed the most delicious afternoon tea to celebrate my son's  belated  birthday on Saturday. We sat in their small but quaint courtyard in the sunny side.
It was by far the best afternoon tea I have had. The chef (from Mumbai  put together some very interesting and tasty dishes together. The chicken and veggie sandwiches were delectable, the small Chaat's, bhajia's and chutneys, together with the paneer wraps  were mouthwatering, the falooda's were divine as was everything else. We struggled to finish everything that was so beautifully presented. He also made the tastiest masala chai (if you ask for this), as it should be. Perfect!
Please pass on my compliments to the chef and also to Joy who was a wonderful, and very polite and attentive waiter. His waitering skills were excellent, he never rushed us and he was very humble too.  He even brought out a small birthday cake with a candle for my son as this was a quite a surprise.
( I can’t remember if I mentioned it was a birthday treat when I booked this) 
If this deal is still available, then I will definitely purchase some more, and take more friends and family to enjoy this sumptuous feast. 
Well done to all.",4,2017,08,29
103,Thanks to Park Grand Paddington,"I was here for business trip and was placed in Canary Wharf. People said the best way to tour London was to shift to Central London and I'm glad I choose Park Grand Paddington. Staff is so friendly, cordial, helpful and smart. A special mention to 'Alrich' as his smart planning helped to me to cover most of London. I loved those tips which were budget friendly. My tip is please don't hesitate hotel staff for asking tips for touring as they are best advisors u can get. The cons are the rooms are smaller as it's Central London but they are clean so it's fine.",5,2017,08,29
103,Great location and real shower,"Location can't be beat, esp if you're flying in and out of Heathrow (catch that Heathrow Express!). Staff were friendly but the letter reminder if you skipped room service was a bit unnecessary. 

Bedroom we stayed in was quite small but suited our needs. Bathroom was recently renovated with a rainfall shower (so lovely) and handheld nozzle. 

Would stay here again but would also look into the Hilton closer to Paddington Station only because it's literally at the station and closer to our family's flat.  ",4,2017,08,28
103,second time!!,"stayed here in june for the second time for seven nights,very conveniently located to tube stations,restaurants close by,rooms thou small very clean and tidy,highly recommend this hotel,would definitely return for the third time.",4,2017,08,27
103,Would stay again,"After reading previous reviews concerning small basement rooms, I phoned the hotel a few days prior to arrival explaining my claustrophobic health issue. On arrival we were given a club room on the 4th floor. My 14 year o!d son was pleased to have a bed of his own and not a sofa bed. Free fruit, soft drinks and a bottle of wine were were available on the first night. All the staff were professional and friendly. The rooms were cleaned to a very high standard. The breakfast was varied and tasty with empty plates being cleared from the tables promptly. This hotel is well situated to the train/tube stations as well as Hyde Park. Would definitely stay again.",4,2017,08,26
103,Amazing Staff made our Trip!!,I recently took my sister to London for a girlie trip to celebrate her 30th Birthday and I could not recommend the Park Grand enough! From the moment we got there the staff made us feel so welcome from the daily calls to see if we needed anything to the little suprises they had waiting for us in our room each day. They really made our stay even more special! Huge thanks to Luanne and her team for making my sisters 30th one to remember! Cant wait to come back!! ,5,2017,08,24
103,Clean and comfortable shoebox for travelers on a budget,"I stayed at the Park Grand Paddington on a business trip. Whereas the room was tiny, it was clean and as comfortable as one could expect of a small room. Staff was friendly and helpful.
Location is excellent and all that for an affordable price. I would stay there again if by myself and just looking for a central location to spend the night without breaking the bank.",5,2017,08,23
103,Great place to live in,"The hotel was extremely clean. The staff were helpful and kindly
The room included many services which make our stay more pleasant

103,Indian afternoon tea ,"Booked the Indian afternoon tea here as part of a day out in London with family. 
Hotel was lovely and clean, staff were very attentive, nothing was too much trouble. 
The food was fabulous! A good selection of foods and flavours and plenty of it along with plenty of prosecco! 
Excellent ",5,2017,08,21
103,"Great location, stylish accommodation and lovely staff.",We have stayed at the Park Grand Paddington Court 3 times now and have thoroughly enjoyed each stay. It is now our first choice when we are in London. The staff are lovely and go out of their way to ensure you have the best stay possible. The compact double rooms are really small but still stylish and well equipped but the size is reflected in the price.  Fine for a short stay or a base to get your head down as the beds are really comfortable. For longer stays I would go up a level if you prefer a bit more space to move around in. The club rooms are lovely and well worth the extra if you can afford it.,5,2017,08,21
103,Excellent service ,"We arrived at the Park Grand Paddington Court after 3 weeks of traveling and with lots of luggage!

When we were escorted to our room, we realised that the room we booked was far too small for us.

Fatma, the lovely conscierge, upgraded our room to better accommodate us. Free of charge! It was absolutely perfect having a bigger room, and a comfortable bed. 

The reception also assisted in the search of a missing item of ours upon arrival!

I'm impressed with their customer service efforts and carrying all our luggage. 

",5,2017,08,21
103,Spazi minimal,"The room was clean and has everything you need.my room was pretty small, let's say essential, but perfect for me. Location is tactic since it is very close to paddington station. Close to the hotel there are few shops and lots of restaurants / pub.",4,2017,08,18
103,Graet Location  - Lovely Staff - Comfortable room,I have used this hotel for business mainly due it its proximity to Paddington Station and facilities available. But this was a family weekend and choose the hotels as I knew my wife and I would be well looked after.,4,2017,08,16
103,Customer service at its best,The Hotel service was excellent and the staff could not have done more in making our stay pleasant and comfortable. One person who especially stood out in ensuring complete customer satisfaction was  Valent Fernandes. He took control of a issue we had and stayed with the problem until conclusion. He kept us informed and dealt with us in a very controlled manner that gave you comfort in knowing that the issue would be sorted and not handed on or dropped. Well done all-round to the Paddington Court management and staff. We look forward to seeing you again.,5,2017,08,15
103,Value for money,"Nice modern rooms, comfortable beds and bathroom. Tea/coffee making facilities in room and breakfast room well equipped and good reasonable buffet breakfast. Hotel even has a cozy/modern bar and gym facilities! Convenient location and walking distance from the tube station and eateries",4,2017,08,15
103,Could not have been any better,"Be warned this is going to be long!

Arrived at the hotel and was welcomed by the staff, as I checked in the hotel manager on duty came out to greet me as she was aware it was my first year anniversary through my request section for the room to be made up nicely. We shook hands with a smile.
She then kindly took us up to our room which was upgraded due to the special occasion and I will say I was blown away by the effort and kindness of the staff.
We walked in to find a beautiful towel decoration on the bed, a bottle of wine, plate of fruit which was covered to keep fresh and a slice of delicious chocolate cake.
The bed was so comfortable we did not wake up for our early morning plans which suited us just fine. Nice flat screen tv to watch before sleeping and when drinking a morning cup of tea.
The shower was great nice hot water and an option of a standard shower head and waterfall.
The bathroom had all the essentials from a toothbrush kit, sewing kit and more. They even give shampoo, conditioner and body wash.
There is air con which enables you to keep the room at the temperature of your choice.
Next to the door there are touch screen options to indicate to staff whether you are sleeping in etc.
Spacious cupboard room which has a safe and fridge inside.
Upon leaving again the hotel manager approached me with a smile and polite manners to ask about my stay and if there was anything else I needed before departing. She definitely made our stay magical.

There is no parking but there is parking outside on the road which you will need to pay for between 8:30 and 6.

I have never been to a hotel in England where the staff are so well spoken and treat you like you are important from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave.
I 100% will be staying here in the future.",5,2017,08,14
103,nice delicate rooms but way too small,"good location near Paddington and Lancaster station. free WiFi in the rooms not, good helpful service.  Some nice cafes near by, rooms are clean and delicate  but really small. the bed is comfy but really really small for 2 ppl.  I will.come again however will want a bigger room ",4,2017,08,14
103,Theatre weekend beak.,"Hotel staff could not do enough for us. We had a small issue with our room on arrival, but this was rectified within minutes. Our room was changed and upgraded free of charge without any hesitation. Room was cleaned daily, topping up the complementary tea and coffee.Will definitely consider returing.The weather was also spot on.  HAPPY DAYS 😊😊
",5,2017,08,14
103,Special occasion overnight stay,"Our early arrival was met with news that we would need to move hotel due to unforeseen maintenance. We asked to speak with manager who was most apologetic and agreed as we had paid and not been notified she would ensure would have a room when we returned to check in.
I cannot believe the extra steps she took to resolve matters to our satisfaction, not only was our room significantly upgraded we had flowers, wine, a phone and cake. This beautiful lady ensured our special weekend was even more special and memorable than we could ask for. We have had issues at other hotels and they have never been managed as professionally or as considerately as this.
Thank you so much Luanne Dias - any top hotel would be lucky to employ you as a manager",5,2017,08,14
103,Great hotel and service,"We had a wonderful two weeks stay in the hotel , the rooms are extremely comfortable,very good beds 
The staff is really very nice and efficient without exception,very helpful and kind 
In addition the food served at the bar or in room service is very good, breakfasts are perfect real British breakfast, continental as wall
Ideal place to stay in center London ",5,2017,08,13
103,"Quick stay, close to Paddington","I had a quick 1 night stay at the Park Grand Paddington. Really just needed a place to rest for a few hours since I had an early morning flight from Heathrow. The hotel is a quick four blocks from Paddington (Heathrow Express) and the Lancaster Gate tube station (Central Line). It's also a few blocks from Hyde Park. Great location with easy train access. 

The hotel itself was nice and modern. The rooms were a little small (had a lot of suitcases making it tight to navigate). The bathroom was similar in that there was limited counter space by the sink. The room was quiet and comfortable throughout the night. 

Overall would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,08,13
103,More space needed to match excellent service,"My sister and I recently spent 11 days at the Park Grand Paddington, and I am happy to recommend it (with one reservation)for the following reasons.It is located within an easy walk to two tube stops (Paddington and Lancaster Gate).The former is dreadfully busy with hoards of tourists but Lancaster Gate is quiet, right across from the beautiful fountains of Kensington Gardens. Nearby are little shops and small restaurants (Italian, Middle Eastern, Chinese), two pubs on the way to Kensington Gardens, small grocers, a pharmacy, a wine shop--it felt like a neighborhood. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, the room spotlessly clean.

However, be wary of what is advertised as the twin deluxe accommodation.The room 
was no larger than a broom closet--no space for two people to pass each other; beds jammed in a room too small for them.  Northing to sit on but the beds, from only one of which the TV was viewable Moving between the beds and the wall required holding ones breath and squeezing.  Because of a health condition we asked for a room with more space and one chair, and we were changed into a larger room  AND-- we were not charged any more.  We were left wondering what a non-deluxe room must be like!

Again, the kindness and helpfulness of the staff was impressive.

103,Visit at Park Grand Paddington Court,"We stayed in London for four days on a sight seeing holiday where we were out for most of the day after breakfast.  This hotel is walking distance (5-10 mins) to Lancaster Gate and Paddington Station.  Very easy access to the tube and into central London.  This hotel is very professional and clean.  The rooms are the usual small room style in Hyde Park, London.  We booked two rooms for our family and were given first floor rooms which were not noisy or problematic.  Upon arrival we found a ""towel cake"" with fresh flowers, wine and dessert to celebrate our anniversary and our child's graduation.  The staff, and particularly the concierge, are very helpful.  The breakfast room and buffet is excellent with good service.  The room and beds are very comfortable.  The robes in the room are lovely and comfy and soft. The hotel provides you with a ""handy"" which is a phone which gives free calling/internet while out and about London.  It was extremely useful in navigating how to get about the city.  The only small issue in the hotel was spotty wifi - it would work, then not work without any apparent reason - but this was small issue in an otherwise fantastic experience.",4,2017,08,12
103,Superb! ,We had a great stay here. We stayed in a double room Deluxe and they're really fresh. On our last day we also recieved a cake just because my boyfriend had his birthday the week later after our visit. Grande gesture! Great staff and terrific neighbourhood! ,5,2017,08,12
103,Great location ,"Very close to the most attractions, quiet neighbourhood...Staff was very professional, with an A+ for Florin and many thanks for his kindness. See you next time!   
We didn t tried the food , maybe another time...   ",5,2017,08,11
103,Amazing stay,I booked this break as a belated birthday and wedding anniversary treat for us.On arrival we checked in and we were asked to take a seat.The duty receptionist Luanne spoke to us to explain that as it was a special occassion we we're being upgraded to a club room .Having spent the day touring London we obtained our keys to find a basket of fruit half a bottle of wine and a slice of chocolate cake with compliments of the hotel .on the bed towels were made into cake with flowers around the edge.It was amazing.We will definitely be back.Thanks to all the staff for an overnight stay.xx,5,2017,08,10
103,Miniature Room,"I stayed 2 nights in a single room at this hotel which was the smallest hotel room that I have ever had outside of a capsule hotel. It was so small that I needed to kneel on the bed to reach the curtains and there was a stool rather than a real chair at the mini-desk. That said the room was in good repair and contained everything that I needed including a kettle, safe and hairdryer. The power strip at the desk had both UK and US outlets which is a nice touch. The wifi was of a reasonable speed but required that you log in again each time it is used. The TV had irritating subtitles switched on that I couldn't seem to remove and I never did find the switch for the light by the bed. Fortunately the power is of the keycard in the slot type so it was easy to switch off all the lights by pulling out the card.

The bathroom was more spacious, not exactly big but big enough to turn around and the shower cubicle was bigger than others that I have had. There was no shelf and no spare surface around the sink so the contents of my soap bag had to go underneath the sink which worked okay for a short stay. 

I have two complaints. Firstly, check in was glacial. The receptionist had poor English and seemed not to understand what she needed to do. I struck the same one at check out and it was no better. Secondly, there was noise both inside and out. I could hear the person in the next room and people passing on the street. It isn't  busy street but the hotel seems to have no sound proofing or not enough.

My room was very cheap by London standards but not cheap enough to entice me back. There are better places in the city that are no more expensive.",3,2017,08,09
103,We keep coming back,"My husband and I stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court at least once a year. It is blocks from the Heathrow Express, the beds are great, the service impeccable and the amenities useful. The rooms are spotless and the breakfasts ample.",5,2017,08,08
103,Excellent Hotel,"We were transferred from the sister hotel along the road which had a fault.
Luanne took great care to make sure we were happy. The hotel was very clean and in good order and was closer to the station by a short distance. We didn't feel disappointed at all by our move and I will book this hotel next time in preference to the other one.",5,2017,08,08
103,Living up to its reputation.,"Our stay began with a smooth transition to guest status. A friendly porter brought our bags to the room and we loved the stylishly decorated double room. With a welcome of red wine and turn down service we settled in happily. A comfortable sleep saw us wake refreshed and ready for a hearty and delicious breakfast available in the hotel dining room.
Park Grand Paddington Court provided us with a comfortable and very convenient stay close to all amenities including the Tube, restaurants and even Kensington Gardens.
The staff were always available and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would definitely return on our next London Trip. Magnificent!",5,2017,08,08
103,Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel,"Hello everyone,
I would like to share with you my experience in Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel which I would personally rate as a 7 star excellent experience due to the great hospitality of qualified and professional staff , from the time I went in to the hotel until I checked out, the smile would not leave their faces's, location of the hotel is very good 4 min walk from paddington underground station, rooms are very clean and has modern style 5/5 for the rooms, AC included which is very rare, with an excellent wifi service, price is very reasonable for the rooms quality I would absolutely stay there in my future visits to London and I would recommend this hotel every time for a family member, special thanks for the awesome hosts Luanne and Alissa.",5,2017,08,07
103,Excellent location next to the Paddington Station and very courteous receptionist,"This place is within easy walk from London Paddington station.  Beautiful Hyde Park is only two blocks away and Lancaster Gate underground station is also within a short walking distance.  Room is very clean but a bit small.  Bath room is quite small. 
Receptionist is very friendly and courteous!",4,2017,08,07
103,Quite the disappointment,"My twin sister and I visited the Park Grand Paddington Court 14 July to 19 July.  While in a convenient location in the Paddington neighborhood, it was an extremely disappointing stay.  When we first arrived, we were given a room in the basement, in a building located across the street from the main building.  The basement room was located below the street level and next door to a fire exit, which would not lock.  When we complained at the front desk, we were treated in a condescending tone from the person at the front desk, who seemed incredulous that we would ask to change rooms.  When asked by my twin ""would you put your mother in that room?"", he then changed his tone.  We were given a temporary room for the evening as the manager claimed there were no other rooms with twin beds available that night.  The temporary room was in yet another location across from the main hotel, with an upstairs that was boarded up and sealed off.  It was clear they were doing work upstairs.  We were moved the next day.  

I understand the hotel rooms in London are small, but our room was tiny, with insufficient outlets to charge devices, and looked out into an air shaft, where a pigeon had taken up residence during our stay.  The layout of the hotel itself is horribly confusing, with inefficient and confusing signs directing you to different rooms.

The only plus was the breakfast, the location, and the day staff, which seemed to be all female.  Florin was a great help, schelping our luggage from room to room, and Sara, I believe her name was, who told us that the manager we spoke to was new.  While he claimed there was no other room for us the night we checked in, she said he was indeed incorrect.  I also feel the rates we paid were far too expensive.

There are far too many other hotels in the Paddington area.  I cannot recommend the Park Grand Paddington Court at all.",2,2017,08,06

On my first night the annoying green light kept me awake so they very kindly taped it over & I slept so much better the second night.  The room was fairly small but very clean and comfortable.  Very stable and fast wifi.  The bathroom was clean with an OK shower.  As usual not a lot of space to put things though!

I left my wallet with $185 in cash in the table next to the bed. The hotel found it and mailed it to me....with the cast still inside! Truly great hotel with the very best in staff. I'll definitely book again on my next visit to London.",5,2017,07,25

The offer of luggage to room was given, our room was small but very clean and pleasant - the bed large and comfortable.

We were surprised by some nice free gifts for our anniversary....we sadly did not eat here and just missed the bar.

The Wifi is free and good en suite. Should we visit Paddington again we would certainly consider this hotel.",4,2017,07,25
103,great hotel,"we stayed 4 nights. the rooms are a little small but good. we arived there was a bottle of wine , water, and soft drinks all free.
the staff was very nice and helpfull. the bath room was small but a lot of emneties you do not see in a lot of hotels.
great location, 5 minutes to the underground. very close was a new area on a canal called little venesia.",5,2017,07,25
103,"Great quality hotel, micro room size","I stayed here at the end of a business trip for a few days of tourism.  Price was reasonable and the hotel was beautiful.  Fits and finishes were high quality.  Breakfast was included in my room price and was good.

My only complaint was the room size.  I was traveling by myself so I only needed one bed.  My room was VERY small, more like a walk in closet in some US homes.  The room was long and narrow.  I could almost touch two of the walls standing in one spot in my room.  

With that said, the hotel was still a decent value for London hotels.",3,2017,07,25
103,A nightmare!,"I did not have a good experience at this hotel, to say the least.  We only planned to stay overnight and leave early in the morning.  We were exhausted, having spent all day travelling.  The front desk person was not particularly helpful, it took quite a while to actually find the room, lugging our heavy bags up and down stairs.  The room and bathroom were suffocatingly small for the amount we were paying.  There was lots of shouting going on in the hallway for quite a long time, and finally, I found bloodstains on my sheets.  I was so exhausted that I didn't have the energy to call down, and since they were small and towards the edge of the mattress, I let it go.  It wasn't till the morning that I noticed there was a large stain on the pillowcase also.  That was really disgusting.  (photo included.)  When checking out, I was asked how our stay was, and I said terrible, and explained, though we were in a rush to catch a train so just wanted to leave it all behind us.  She went to get a manager, show offered us a 20% discount.  I said fine and left.  That's when the fun really started!  Two weeks later, having not heard a word about the discount or even an apology (just the standard ""how was everything"" email)  I wrote back to say that I had not received anything from them.  Two days later I still hadn't heard back so called Getaroom to find out if they had gotten anything.  They hadn't and the agent on the phone put me on hold for 35 minutes as he attempted to call the hotel.  He called 4 times to a wrong number before coming back to tell me he couldn't get through and would I take 10% from the booking agent instead.  I said no, and looked up the real phone number, gave it to him, and was put on hold again before he finally came back and said there was no manager there and to call back in an hour.  I said that was ridiculous and that they should call me back in an hour.  So when, OF COURSE, they didn't call back and I had to call them back 2 hours later, I asked for a supervisor.  Another 15 minutes on hold and finally the supervisor came back to say that it was all fixed and I would get my refund!  It was only then that I heard back from the hotel in reply to my email (from 2 days before,) to tell me they were giving me the refund.  I wrote back that it was inexcusable to not answer back till then - only after hearing from the booking agent.  They replied asking for my phone number.  TWO DAY LATER the manager finally called, saying he had no idea about any of this and there didn't seem to be any information about what happened (though I was told by the first booking agent that the receptionist he spoke to remembered the situation.)  The manager offered another 20% as compensation for everything I had been through and I wearily accepted.  That was over a week ago, so I finally wrote back to say that I had not received anything AGAIN!  They wrote back saying that they had sent it to the booking agent and for me to talk to them.  So I called the booking agent, who said they had received NOTHING and called the hotel.  The hotel told them that they would send it, and I would get my additional 20% in 3 to 5 business days.  We'll see...  So, in conclusion, i'd steer clear of both this hotel and Getaroom.  A horrible experience!",1,2017,07,22
103,"good service, friendly. Nice rooms. Reasonable prices","I've tested a lot of hotlel in London and this one is my favorite for business trip. Prices are reasonable, location is central, service is excellent and rooms are quiet and nice, modern, with comfortable bed.",5,2017,07,21
103,Very conveniently located,"We wanted easy public transportation to Heathrow and city of London.  This was very convenient.  There is the Heathrow Express directly to Paddington Station and then it's about a 10 minute walk to this hotel.  I did learn there is cheaper train between Heathrow to the hotel and you can check with the hotel about that.  The are a great many other train routes from Paddington, so it is very easy to navigate if you stay here.  The room was very clean, though small.  We were in 407.  Our only complaint was 2 nights when the 2 rooms right by us were rented to people traveling together and they were very noisy until 11 pm going back and forth to each other's rooms.  Not the hotel's fault.  They have an English breakfast which was included in our booking.  They also have guest assistant on staff who can help you with any tourist questions you may have.  We were just a few blocks from Hyde Park which connects to Kensington Park.  A very nice, large area for a good walk.  There's even a little cafe near the Hyde Park entrance we used with decent food.  To get around the London area and not get lost, use the Yellow line to and from Paddington Station.  It runs in a continuous circle so you can't get too lost.  And get the Oyster Card for visitor's, it's you best bargain for transportation.",4,2017,07,20
103,Can't complain!!!,"Nice location, great room but a bit small, really great staff, very clean and aircon which works!!! Small but perfectly ok bar, didn't try the restaurant. I'll be back, again!! Already booked!! Definitely recommended!.",5,2017,07,19
103,Memorable Weekend,"Booked a 2 night stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court for British Summer Time Festival in Hyde Park. Chose the hotel for the location and the ease of getting to Hyde Park. I had another plan in mind which I requested the help of the hotel staff with prior to our arrival. I liaised with Sara in Guest Relations who helped me plan the perfect proposal. She made a point of greeting us on arrival but was discreet despite her knowledge of my plan to propose to my girlfriend that evening. Once checked in we headed out for the afternoon/evening. When we returned the room had been decorated with balloons and rose petals and I was able to ask the most important question of my life (She said yes!!). Sara and the team had exceeded expectations with the lengths they went to to make the weekend special. We cannot thank them enough for everything they did for us. Would definitely recommend to others and will be going back as it is now a special place for us.

Just to add also, the room was a great size with amenities you wouldn't always expect in a hotel room such as a microwave and fridge. The bathroom was also a good size. ",5,2017,07,18
103,Andreas Adoni,My Stay at the hotel was really enjoyable. The hotel has an excellent service for a business stay. It is located near 3 underground stations and the access to taxis is really easy as well. I would recommend the hotel absolutely,5,2017,07,18
103,"Clean, tiny and just about adequate","I booked a last minute hotel to be close to Paddington and Heathrow express. Hardly expensive (but at the same time not especially cheap), the description and pictures of this hotel belied the experience of my tiny, end of passage basement room with a window onto a closed courtyard with air conditioning units and barely 20m above the tube line. Actually room turned out to be clean, kitted out ok, bed quite comfy and staff were perfectly friendly. Wouldn't return though and the description needs to be more straight.",3,2017,07,17
103,Good Location,"Stayed for one night at the Park Grand Paddington Court, and asked to change rooms twice - 3rd time lucky!  The first room we were offered was in the building opposite the main hotel, which was supposed to be a suite, however, it was in the basement and was like a tiny box room, we were then shown a similar size room in the main building with all the air conditioners outside the window, which we turned down, finally we were offered a good sized room with a very large bed and modern bathroom, which was acceptable.",3,2017,07,17
103,Appreciated the extras,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights. The room was clean, tidy and modern even though it was small (as expected- the size was shown on their website). Great location in a quiet area near Paddington station and a number of restaurants. The hotel breakfast was nice with a variety of hot and cold options. We particularly appreciated the room upgrade and extra touches the staff provided to us as we were on our honeymoon. Overall a lovely stay. ",4,2017,07,15
103,Great location,Booked for proximity to Hyde Park venue. Easy to walk back to the hotel from there. Check in took a while but everyone seemed to arrive at once and the staff dealt with it as best they could. Lovely building. Small room but everything you needed for a short stay including a fridge and a microwave.  Bed comfortable and breakfast was very nice. Near to Paddington station and to the underground. Plenty of shops bars and restaurants nearby. Surprisingly quiet for a London hotel in a busy area. We did not get woken up by outside noise. Would use this hotel again.,5,2017,07,12
103,4 star?,"Not in comparison to the others in London. The rooms were tiny. The doubled beds only had one side to get in such was the way the beds had been shoe horned into the corners. We borrowed an ironing board, which meant one person had to lie/sit on the bed because of lack of room. Besides the size, the room was pretty clean despite finding a sock under the dressing table. So gave the view that attention to detail wasn't being paid which surely is the norm at a 4 star?",3,2017,07,12
103,Well located but rooms are really compact,"Very good location but the twin  bed is really narrow , hospitable staff and the central location makes up for the inconvenience . 

you can walk to the paddington station , hyde park and there are a good number of restaurants close by",4,2017,07,12
103,Excellent,"From the second we arrived at the hotel the reception staff and concierge  could not have been more pleasant or more helpful.  During our stay they were extremely helpful with arranging taxis, suggesting restaurants and places to visit  Our room was very comfortable and clean. Wide choice for breakfast.  The hotel is in an excellent location, walking distance to Kensington Gardens/shops/restaurants etc.  Will definitely re-visit",5,2017,07,11
103,Wonderful Experience,"Really enjoyed this hotel. The room was spotless and there were lots of added extras including some lovely fruit, a bottle of wine and some chocolates. The staff were so helpful and went out of their way to make our stay memorable.",5,2017,07,11
103,a great hotel with a great customer service,"i was a retuning guest to hotel and amazed by the little gesture by cust care to leave a personally signed card welcoming me

good clean rooms great location and ok breakfast which infact could be better for price they charge for it.",5,2017,07,10
103,2 night stay for a concert,"Booked the hotel as convenient for Paddington Station and cheaper than staying at a Hotel closer to Wembley Stadium for a concert.  Found the hotel easily and just a 10 minute walk from Paddington.  Greeted at Reception by friendly staff and shown to our room.  We booked a twin room and it was quite narrow but it had very comfortable beds, fridge, microwave, t.v, hairdryer, safe, tea & coffee facilities and bottles of water.  The room looked like it had been recently refurbished along with the bathroom.  The staff were all very helpful when we asked them how to get to different places.  The breakfast was buffet style which had continental and cooked and the staff there were very efficient. The hotel was convenient for Hyde Park which we walked through, only about 15 minutes away.  We had a room that was at the side of the hotel on the second floor which looked out over a mews of houses and found it very quiet. We would stay there again.",5,2017,07,10
103,Very poor,"To be greeted by a queue out the door for check in was ridiculous.  3 members of staff for check in and it still took 35 mins!! !
Why are UK citizens asked for photo id? I said no as felt this wasn't necessary. 
The receptionist said you are in room *** and walked off! Ummm excuse me where on earth am I going to get to room ***?? 
The customer service got worse and worse.
Our room was an upgrade which we paid over the top for as it was tiny and next to the lift so we got woken several times through the night from guests.
The aircon didn't work!
I went down to request a room change on the Saturday and guess what the queue was out the door again! No way I'm staying in that AGAIN! 
Breakfast staff a joke who stand around watching you eat whilst chatting to colleagues you then finish and they totally ignore it.
I raised these issues on check out as all other reviews are so good and received 3 emails for my reviews directly from the hotel after check out but guess what no reply so thought I would share on here.
Very kindly on the Sunday reception had told the poor cleaner we had checked out so walked straight in. On checking out at reception someone has already checked us out!
Location to Paddington and Hyde park is fantastic! 

Won't return due to above points!",2,2017,07,06
103,Nice hotel in a great location,"We stopped here for 1 night when attending a concert in Hyde Park.

Great Location, newly refurbished rooms and very good customer service.

My only criticism is as a UK citizen and booking online (the hotel already having all your details), and producing a credit card which matched the original booking, they still requested photo id.  I didn't have any as I've never had to do that in any other london hotel i've frequented over the years.  It didn't cause a major problem, but just found that a little unprofessional.  Granted for overseas visitors, as you would when you go abroad, but not within your own country of residence.

Overall, a pleasant stay.",4,2017,07,05
103,Hidden Gem,"I booked to stay for 4 nights in a club room,although very busy on my arrival i was greeted with a pleasant smile from the front desk staff. The room itself was a good size and very comfortable and i was pleasantly surprised to find a bottle of wine greeting me. The shower room was a little cramped but not overly annoying. As always the breakfast on offer was great. Overall i thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and would highly recommend this  hotel to anyone",4,2017,07,04
103,Good value,"Ideal location for Hyde Park concert. Clean, compact, ideal for one night stay. Staff all friendly and helpful especially the front desk and waiting staffl. Good breakfast included.would use this hotel again for short stay.",4,2017,07,04
103,"Good Hotel, staff and value",Booked 2 nights at a very reasonable price. Reception staff and bell boys were extremly helpfull and pleasant. Room was a good size clean and comfortable. Breakfast was included in the rate and was very good.,5,2017,07,04
103,Amazing Stay! 5* ,"What a great hotel!! Right near everything yet quiet. Check in was quick and efficient with a member of staff insistent on carrying the bags to the room. Once there he advised us the bottle of red wine, fruit bowl, and dressing gown and slippers were all completely from the hotel to us which I thought was lovely. After a long day traveling to walk into cans of pop and water free of charge was a nice touch. Each morning we had the days newspaper pushed under the door before we awoke. We ate in the hotel one evening on the terrace, I had lamb and potatoes, my partner burger and fries. Came to £25 without drinks which in London is very reasonable and delicious too. All the staff were very helpful and attentive and I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,07,04
103,good hotel,This room was very clean and the front desk people very pleasant. Also the man that helped with our bags took the extra few minutes to so us the features of the room. The room was quiet which made sleeping easy.,5,2017,07,03
103,Very good location and friendly staff,"We have stayed in a compact double room. It was very clean but very small, so I suggest you not to choose ""compact"" room as it is certainly not comfortable for 2 people.
Overall, the hotel was very clean, helpfull and the location is very good. Only a 5 mins walk to the tube station and 1 stop to Notting Hill.
Also Fatima in the reception was very very helpfull, very friendly and professional.",4,2017,07,03
103,Ideal place to stay for Hyde Park,"Booked a one night stay as hotel was close to Hyde Park. A lovely small hotel with very helpful staff. Rooms very clean and modern with very comfortable beds. A very enjoyable stay, would recommend this hotel.",5,2017,07,03
103,Nice hotel great staff,We had a wonderful 4 night stay here. Beds really comfortable.  Very quiet.  Upon our arrival we were welcomed in our room with a towel cake that had fresh flowers on it..a small bottle of wine and a dessert. We were in London to celebrate our anniversary and a birthday. What a lovely touch.  We have to give a big thank you to Zdravko .  He is a sincere young man who was extremely helpful to us. Please give him our thanks.  This hotel is located in a very nice neighbourhood.  Nice cafes..grocery stores..Kengsington garden close.  Try the little italian restaurant up the street. It was fantastic!!,4,2017,06,29
103,Still have to learn a lot about service,"First of all:
the Hotel was clean and the breakfast good. The stuff at breakfast was fast and helpful. The rooms are smal, but we booked a club room, so it was Ok, even the bathroom is still smal, but it was very clean, so the stay was nice.

The service is not coordinated, better said, nearly a desaster:
1) When I made my booking I asked for a quiet room and got one with the aircondition engine below our window, so we have to ask for a room move. We got few chocolates and a nice letter, after our move. So we where happy in our new room:
but then:
2) We order a wake up call, that never comes, so we missed our day trip! There was just a quick ""sorry"" and thats it. It cost me a lot of money and a ruined day in London.
3) I send an email days before arriving, that there will be an order arriving the hotel, and asked to leave it in my room. When we checked in they told me it arrived, so I asked them to bring it to my room. As at 8 PM nothing has happend, I called again to the reception. And finally got it.
4) There was no pre- advert, that the lift will be under maintance. We asked for help with the luggage from the 3rd floor as we where late to the airport. In the end we did it at our own, as there was no one coming.
5) I just wantet to get my flight and check out, but I was asked about my email adress and more things, as they wantet to talk about the missed wake up call. Dint they have time enough during my stay?
6) In the end I got the promised email from the hotel, but, surprise, it was not for me, it was for another client.

I work in an Hotel as well and I know that this kind of things can happend. One of these, maybe two, but all of them are just too much.

If you just need a clean Hotel next to Paddington, with a good breakfast, go here. If you need something more, just orginise it on your own.",3,2017,06,29
103,Great,"Good location, about 5mins from Paddington Station and it's right by Hyde Park. Stayed here for 5 nights for work. Bellboy was really helpful, had some issues with the rental car and he went out of his way to search for a solution. Great desk and room service too. Room size was expected for the location, not too small and not that big. Toilet was clean too.
Overall, great stay, would recommend nda stay here again.",5,2017,06,27
103,Indian afternoon tea,"Booked this afternoon tea using a voucher.The deal was afternoon tea with a bottle of prosecco.We arrived and were warmly greeted by Joy and a very pleasant waitress whose name I didn't get.We were offered a table in the garden or near the window and once we settled on our table Joy proceeded to run through what we were about to receive. The afternoon tea arrived and again Joy was very attentive and explained all of the items on the trays.The food was fantastic,and then the Bottle of prosecco arrived to complement the food.This is a fantastic deal and I would suggest buying it before they stop it. The hotel and staff were exemplary and I would go again in a heartbeat.Thank you to all the staff for making the occasion so good",5,2017,06,26
103,Weekend break,"I booked a club room so paid a little extra. The concierge showed us to our room and initially  I was a little disappointed with the size of the room, feeling it was a bit small. But it was tastefully decorated and ultra clean with air con included . We were given some complimentary refreshments including a small bottle of red wine. Also included were lovely fluffy dressing gowns and some slippers. The bed was lovely and comfortable and the en-suite shower was fab. The room was cleaned every day with  clean sheets and towels. The staff were super friendly so all in all a very nice hotel which I'd certainly return to and recommend to others.",5,2017,06,26
103,It's class,Cannot fault the staff in this hotel the head of reception were sooo helpful made our birthday stay wonderful cannot thk them enough xx the location great and breakfast outstanding air con was great and especially as very hot summer,5,2017,06,26
103,Vacation to London,"The staff at Park Grand are Superb. They met all our needs & gave excellent service. The breakfast was included when I booked it, however when I got there, it didn't state this they said. 
They checked with someone higher up & allowed me the breakfast bar all 3 days. This made my stay exceptional. The only negative i have is the room was very small & there's not enough room for 2 persons luggage & there isn't an outlet in the bathroom. However, the room was clean & the air conditioner worked great with all the amenities. The distance from the Centre of London is not too far, however the hop on off bus stop is around 1/2 a mile & that was quite a walk for me as a senior with a hip issue. If you do stay there, the closer bus stop is right & go straight about 4-6 blocks, where the St. Ends take a right on the main St. & you will find the hop on hop off bus stops just a short distance down. ",5,2017,06,24
103,Wonderful hotel and staff,"This hotel is excellent! Stayed here for 4 nights with my fiancé. When we pulled up with my bags the staff was already assisting us. Check in was easy, the time we got there the room was not ready but I was able to check in and leave my luggage. The hotel itself was nicely decorated. We had a street view room with a double bed. Comfortable bed and very clean room. The room and bathroom seem like they were renovated not too long ago. The staff were great, they were able to help with dining suggestions, directions, baggage and anything else we needed. Overall definitely enjoyed my stay here and will hopefully be returning in the future. ",5,2017,06,22
103,Beware!,"Rooms are not as they are shown!   We booked a deluxe twin and got 2 beds head to head with no room to walk!   They did offer to change our room but we were so tired and we were only going to be there another nite, we decided to stay put...but told them that they had misrepresented the room and they should correct description!   They offered us 15per cent discount in the end but we told them to change the description instead! ...that we would review so others will know not to book there.",2,2017,06,22
103,Good hotel. Would stay again,"Held my luggage when my flight arrived early morning and room was not ready. Took care of most of check in so when room was ready I just had to go back and get the key pretty much. 
Staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Tea and coffee in room was big help in mornings. I loved the turn down service with the chocolates. The bathroom amenities were great. 
Close to restaurants and tube station. I walked to Royal Albert Hall from here though Hyde Park and it wasn't bad. I liked the location of the hotel. 
I would stay here again for sure. ",5,2017,06,22
103,Indian Afternoon Tea,"Fantastic service from Joy and Sarah. We really enjoyed all of the food and were left feeling incredibly satisfied. Excellent concept of an Indian theme, something we have not tried before but really enjoyed. Hope to be back again soon. ",5,2017,06,21
103,1 night stopover ,"A delightful hotel . Friendly , helpful staff , beautiful rooms with lovely linen . Large flat screen TV  enormous choice for viewing .
Good  food and wine plus a little courtyard to enjoy.
Compared to most accommodation in London the room is ample for 1 or 2 people , lovely king size bed and bathroom. 
Cannot emphasis how wonderful all the staff have been ,after a long flight it was a much appreciated  .",5,2017,06,19
103,MR,"I had a great lodging experience with park grand paddington Ct , specially MISS FATMA @ the front desk & mr RONY were  absolutely exceptional !!
I would rate them *****
I would love to recommend to my friends n family to this hotel !! Thanks guys !! Loved ur service ",5,2017,06,19
103,Spot on!,Had a brief but very enjoyable stay here. Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Very clean and comfortable room. Excellent location - just 5 mins from Paddington train and tube stations. Can't recommend highly enough! ,5,2017,06,18
103,Great Twist on an Afternoon tea classic!,We had a wonderful afternoon out at the Park Grand. We were a mixed family group with lots of different tastes. I am from Wales and my mother in law is from Gujarat. The Indian afternoon tea suited everyone - hot steaming Chai just like you would get in Mumbai and beautiful scones with clotted cream. There was plenty of food and the Proseco was flowing. The service was fantastic - Joy our waiter was so attentive and nothing was too much trouble. He even presented a special cake for my Mother in law as it was her birthday. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a twist on a classic afternoon tea.,5,2017,06,18
103,Excellent saty,"I chose this hotel because fits with my business needs. It is close to Paddington train station and also to different tube stations. Staff is great, very nice and always supportive. Room size are good (excellent for London). Tea and coffee making facitilies avaiable in the room. In room free wifi.",5,2017,06,16
103,Small but perfectly formed,"Zdravko the Concierge was extremely helpful. Not only did I get the quiet room I requested, he arranged a very early checkin (10am), which was bliss after a long flight. It's an old building so the rooms can be a bit awkward to get to. The room itself was small but had everything I needed. The aircon was very quiet.",4,2017,06,16
103,The best hotel,"What a great hotel! Helpful and friendly staff, clean and nice room, delicious breakfast. Handy in the room with unlimited calls and internet, and you can take it with you into the city with no extra cost.",5,2017,06,14
103,Excellent stay,"We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Paddington Station, the train station for both the Heathrow Express (we flew into Heathrow) and the train to Cornwall (where we were headed).  We stayed here for two nights. 

We were thoroughly pleased with the hotel, where we stayed in a club room.  Pros:  4-minute walk from Paddington Stn and Underground; quiet neighborhood; huge, comfortable bed in clean room; new, high-quality furnishings in bathroom; nice bedside reading lights; free wi-fi; helpful staff; and everything else worked as it should.  Cons:  none.  I can't comment on the breakfast because we did not eat at the hotel.  A great little coffee/pastry/sandwich place, Leclerc and Laurent, is just around the corner.

We will definitely patronize this hotel again.",5,2017,06,12
103,Grand Location - Grand Staff,"We stayed here for five nights during the London leg of our holiday. Firstly let me say, if you are a couple then do not make the same mistake we did and book the compact room. This room is ONLY suitable for businessmen and the like. 

Although we did stay one night in the smaller room because the hotel was fully booked, the staff were fantastic and the next day we negotiated an upgrade to a Club Room for the remainder of our stay.

The Club Room is a great size although the ensuite in the room we had was very small notwithstanding it was very well appointed. Also, and to be expected in these older hotels, we could hear other guests moving around upstairs and in the corridor.

We had the breakfast which we considered to be of great quality and quantity. We also ate/drank at the hotel bar which we considered offered great value.

The hotel has a great number of staff on hand to ensure all of your needs are catered for. Every staff member without exception were friendly and helpful.  I would especially like to mention the Reception Staff, Concierge Staff, and in particular Ms Sara Pires who went out of her way to ensure our stay was memorable. ",5,2017,06,12
103,Business meeting,"Situated on the corner abt half a mile from Paddington station in a quite area.
Friendly staff and good amenities.
Pleasantly served with coffee and tea as required.
Typical London prices but staff and service are excellent.",4,2017,06,12
103,Excellent hotel,"After our original booking at the sister hotel (Park Grand London Paddington) became unavailable, we were moved to this wonderful hotel. We had a family suite and were most definitely not disappointed. The service we received was second to none and I highly recommend this wonderful hotel. The location is perfect. There was nothing that the staff would or could not do for us. Possible the best hotel I have stayed in in London so far!",5,2017,06,11
103,"Nice hotel, Excellent location",We stayed here for six nights in a club room.  The rooms are small so I would recommend a club room for a couple.  The room was on the ground floor in the back and was quiet.  Bed had just the right firmness. There was a half bottle of red wine and fruit in the room on our arrival--a nice touch.  The room had a small refrigerator.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  It's about a ten minute walk to Paddington station where you have access to the Tube as well as the Heathrow Express.  About a five minute walk to Hyde Park and the Lancaster Gate tube station (scheduled to resume service in July).  Excellent breakfast buffet.  The small lounge has a limited dinner menu if you feel like staying in at night.  This was the second time we stayed here this year and I would not hesitate to stay here again on our next trip to London.,5,2017,06,11
103,Wonderful Afternoon Tea :),"We recently had an afternoon tea at Park Grand Paddington Court and the experience was really great. Staff Zenina and Guest relations Sara Pires were really helpful and welcoming.  
Food was great especially the masala chai :) Good value for money.",5,2017,06,11
103,Hotel stay,"Really nice hotel,staff are friendly,service was excellent,hotel is ideally situated near Paddington Station,room was small but perfectly formed😀comfortable beds nice bathroom,would stay there again and recommend to friends.
",5,2017,06,10
103,Excellent choice for couples visiting London ,"My partner and I booked a deluxe room for our stay. On short notice (I.e. An hour before arrival) requested a quiet room. The friendly staff at the hotel were able to accommodate us and upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that our room had been upgraded to a club room for no extra cost. 

The room was great and the hotel is conveniently located in a very picturesque neighbourhood which is walking distance from Hyde Park, Buckingham palace, the eye etc. The hotel is well connected with public transport as it is close to Paddington station. 

It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting London as a tourist.",5,2017,06,10
103,Small but efficient and conveniently located,"This place is great! The rooms are small but the staff is very helpful. First day in and my plug adapter didn't work. The maintenance man gave me another to use while on stay. The place is on a quiet street but minutes from Hyde park, paddington and other locations with tons of food choices. ",4,2017,06,08
103,Smallest room I've ever seen!,"The hotel is well located, three short blocks from Paddington Station, and the people there are very attentive.  I was shocked by the tiny size of my room, which made my last cruise ship cabin feel enormous by comparison.  Still, the price was right and I was grateful for the accommodations at the end of a very long day, despite being in the basement.  Everything worked well, but every time you move, you have to move something out of your way.",3,2017,06,06
103,Fantastic Hotel,"A short, easy walk from Paddington Station, this hotel was wonderful. I took my 3 year old for a trip to London and all of the staff were fantastic with her. From helping to carry the pushchair up and down steps to generally just been nice to us. The room was small as expected, but they pack everything you could need in there! Even though the room was small we never felt cramped. There was a fantastic walk in shower with a waterfall shower head which we LOVED! The bed was a good size for us to share and there was a good sized TV, coffee and tea making facilities as well as water provided. The room was also facing a quiet street and we slept great both nights we were there. Would more certainly stay here again without a doubt.",5,2017,06,06
103,Great stay in London,"This hotel was a great place to stay for our few days in London. Well placed for transport to the West Ens and shops with options for bus and tube. Lots of nearby eating options. Excellent service and a really good breakfast. Rooms were extremely clean and well appointed. The room was small, but this is London, and it was all manageable. The staff were first rate in attitude and support. Would absolutely stay here again and recommend it.",5,2017,06,03
103,A truly memorable stay!,"Excellent location, welcoming and very friendly staff for whom nothing was too much trouble, clean and very comfortable club room with tea and coffee-making facility and a small fridge and microwave, very good breakfast restaurant and bar-room dining.",5,2017,06,03
103,Nice hotel at perfect location for London visitors,"My wife and I have stayed in Park Grand Paddington Court for 5 nights in May 17
The hotel is located in 5 minutes walking distance from Paddington railway station and undeground. Also - in 5 minutes walking distance from Hyde park and Kensigton gardens. Overall - very good start point for visiting main London's attractions. 
The room was relativelly small but clean and with all the accessories. The hotel staff was friendly and helpfull. The breakfast was excellent. WIFI in our room worked perfectly during our stay there.

Bottom line - nice place and very good value for money. We would definetly consider this place for our next visit to London and will recommend it to our friends as well.",5,2017,06,03
103,4 night stay in London,Stayed in Club room. Room was very comfortable. excellent WiFi. Clean and very up dated bathroom. Breakfast is the best. Lots of choices. Location is great. Able to walk from Paddington Station and to Hyde Park.,5,2017,06,03
103,Good hotel,"I booked a deluxe room and i have been given room number 118. It was not even standard room, it was like a store in the building. 

Second day i complain about it and then they gave a deluxe room.

Rooms and toilet were clean and nice. A bit small that was good room compare to others in London. 

Breakfast was good. Hotel location is good close to paddington train station. 

The Italian lady at the recaption was very helpful and nice. ",4,2017,06,02
103,exceptional property,"Room 204 was small, but highly appointed.  Property is extremely nice, staff is 1st class.  Great location with nice restaurants and only a short walk to Paddington station and the Heathrow Express.  Safe neighborhoods.",5,2017,05,31
103,Try to avoid basement rooms (-1 level!) for 204 GBP/night!,"Stayed 2 nights for 408 GBP. Got the single room in the basement (-1 level). The room is approx.3.5 square metre+bathroom, but when you got the bed, small table and a wardrobe there is only a corridor of maybe 1.5m long when you enter the room. 
Photos i have maybe don't visualize it quite good. The hotel was refurbished 1 year ago they say and it looks that way.
There is a LCD TV mounted on the wall. In the wardrobe you have a hair dryer and a safe box. My room was quiet, looking at the inner part of the building. Colleague of mine was also on the -1 level, but her room was close to the staff entrance/hotel,kitchen supply entrance and she heard the noises through the night.
Restaurant for breakfast is also on -1 level, very tight space (obviously this was a basement before, now used as a hotel area). Food was standard, cheese, butter, some sausages, baked beans, scrambled eggs, coffee, tea, juice.
I know that it's the London and the hotel prices are high, but for 204 GBP per night i didn't expect to be placed in the basement!!!",2,2017,05,31
103,Delightful,"Newly refurbished rooms, clean and functional. Staff members are professional and accommodating. Located in Paddington, the hotel is central and in a beautiful district. I would recommend it if you wish to spend a weekend in this fantastic city.",4,2017,05,29
103,In London NOW,"Here now in Park Grand Padd over 3 days.  I realized today that I can find nothing substantial to complain about with this hotel!!!  Location yes. Right at Hyde Park, Royal Albert Hall, Paddington Station/ Heathrow XPS. Harrods, etc. 

Check in stellar, very very nice simple room that meets my prerequisite: Clean, Cold, Quiet. Room Service Quick & Courteous. Quick wifi. Massive king bed

What's happened to me that I cannot find fault??? Have I actually run into a PERFECT hotel??  Job well done staff & Mgmt.",4,2017,05,28
103,"Conveniently located, friendly staff","Located close to Paddington Station, this hotel is easy to reach from Heathrow Airport. Close to the underground for easy access to all central London tourist destinations, it is also an easy walking distance to Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park and Kensington Palace. 
The staff were really friendly and helpful. There was a problem with the plumbing in my room which was attended to so promptly that it made my head spin!
The English breakfast was delicious.
Be prepared for rooms of minuscule proportions and ensuite bathrooms even smaller, but clean, comfortable and quiet all the same. The hotel is like a rabbit warren, so don't forget which floor and how many turns and doors you have to go through or you could be lost forever!,,,
I have stayed here twice now and would be really happy to stay again.",4,2017,05,27
103,Great Stay,"I had a four night stay with my son here.  The hotel has a great location.  Within walking distance to Paddington station.  This hotel is close to many pubs, restaurants, a shops.  The staff at the hotel is excellent and very helpful.  Could not ask for a better staff.  The room is average size like most hotels in London.  The room was vey clean.  The bed were more comfortable then they looked.  The bathroom was the highlight of the room.  There was a rain head shower and heated floors in the bathroom.  The bathroom was pretty good size for a London hotel.  If I had any complaint at all was our room was in the basement of the building but that was not even a big deal.  Will most likely return here again in October for a few nights.  Great hotel for the price!",4,2017,05,25
103,First rate,"I only stayed at the Park Grand for one night, but my experience from start to finish was first rate. I checked in very late but the process was smooth and efficient. The room was small but perfectly formed and had obviously been recently refurbished. I had a window that opened which is a real find in London! I slept like a baby and breakfast was perfectly acceptable. I had a slight issue when I thought that I had lost my wedding room. The team (led by Alissa) responded en masse and a thorough search was undertaken. Nothing was found, but it later transpired that I had misplaced it. However, the response of the team was first rate. All in all a great experience for a good price. I will be back.",5,2017,05,24
103,"Great Hotel, Great Location","We stayed a total of 5 nights at the Park Grand Paddington Court wrapped around a short visit to Bruges, Belgium (3 nights/2 nights). Both rooms we were assigned were a good size and very clean. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom facilities were quite modern and efficient. The amenities were excellent. We chose to take the breakfast, which included a full English breakfast (eggs, sausage, ham, potatoes, baked beans, mushrooms) along with a large selection of breads, fruits, yogurts, dry cereal, juices, breakfast pastries and coffee and tea. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We appreciated all the help from the Front Desk and Concierge (Zdravko and Fatima were especially helpful). We would definitely stay here again, and the location is a real plus.",5,2017,05,23
103,Excellent accomodation and service,We had a two night stay at the hotel with no complaints whatsoever. The staff were friendly and could not do enough to help. The room was lovely and comfortable. A very pleasant stay. We would definitely stay again.,5,2017,05,23
103,"Wonderful Stay, Professional Staff","I stated with my mother in a twin room at this hotel. The hotel is located almost in the middle of London. You get very east access to Paddington Railway Station & Underground (7 Min Walking distance), Bus Station (5 Minutes Walk), plenty of Cafes and Restaurants scattered around few minutes walk (including many Halal ones!). The Hotel is run by professional young and carefully selected ladies who would be charming and helpful at any time. I would definitely stay here if I ever come back to London again.",5,2017,05,23
103,Business Trip Done Right,"I had a lovely experience at the Park Grand. Upon arrival, I was exhausted from all the travel, so they kindly booked me a very quiet room, which was quite cozy. The winding staircases and what not had me a bit lost as we wove around the halls, but the room was quite comfortable and modern, which was nice. I was a 5 minute walk from the station in the morning, which was superb, and while you're so close, you cannot hear any trains or background noise from the rooms. The staff was very lovely and called immediately once I arrived to my room to ensure everything was suitable and that if I needed anything at all, I could just ask and make myself right at home. Next time I have an early morning train from Paddington, I will certainly return to this lovely hotel.",4,2017,05,23
103,Weekend away,"Stayed here before so booked again. Great location just a short 10 minute stroll from Paddington stn. Turn right from stn down Praed Street,  check in quick by friendly staff, shown to our room by Alex who took our luggage to our room ( 416 on 4th floor via lift ). Room was compact double but lovely comfy bed, room had fridge and safe even a microwave!!! View over a back street but was ok. No noise from the main road. Breakfast was good with everything we wanted and cooked nice. On arriving back from day out ( Sat ) found our bed adorned with rose petals and towels made up looking like a heart !!! Also there were strawberries with chocolate on, plus a slice of cheesecake..... we have never had this before anywhere other hotel/b&b!!!!!! Overall brilliant stay.",5,2017,05,21
103,Excellent hotel but not suitable for those with walking difficulties.,"The hotel is a gem, great location near Paddington station, great price, and wonderful helpful staff, who went out of their way to help, allowing us to check in even though we were very early, and, when realising we needed a room suitable for my dad who walks using a stick, showed me several rooms to see which was the most suitable. However, even though this hotel is found through search engines listing as ""Disabled friendly"", the rooms and all the facilities, and even the lifts, are only accessible by negotiating steep stairs, on highly polished floors with no hand rails. The rooms that have walk in shower facilities, while being suitable, are not accessible by lift. My disabled father who walks with the aid of a stick had endless problems negotiating the stairs, only managing due to staff and other guests helping when he was using the stairs. He nearly fell on several occasions. I have never been in a hotel that is so unsuitable for anyone with walking difficulties, which is such a shame as otherwise the hotel, location, facilities and staff were excellent.
This is not a criticism of the hotel in that they do not describe themselves as disabled friendly, but when being listed in a search of “London Hotel + Disabled Friendly” there was no reason to contact the hotel to question this.",4,2017,05,21
103,Tourism in London,"Staff very professional and very kind. Nice room with a very nice bathroom with showrer.
Very good position near metro stations, bus stations and very easy to walk to Hyde Park and reach city touristic sites. The hotel provided us a free smartphone to call and to surf on internet.",5,2017,05,18
103,Loveley daytrip to a great city,"We had a very nice stay at this hotel. The rooms have a nice size, they are clean. The staff is really helpful and give you the feeling that you are really welcome. The breakfast buffet is quite small but you find everything to start a perfect day in a graet city. Hyde Park entrence is just five minutes away by walking distance. Paddington station is as well just five minutes away by walking distance. You can store your bags at the hotel if you arrive earlier than 2.00pm and you cean leave it there as wll after checkout time without any additional charge. 
All in all I can just recommand this hotel for a stay in London and I will definiteley come back!",5,2017,05,18
103,"Excellent stay, great location!","We stayed at the Park Grand for a couple nights and it was perfect! After almost 30hrs of flying, it was the perfect place to recoup. The staff were very welcoming and kind. Always readily available to help if needed. The room is cozy, but was perfect for my husband and I. There were plenty of plugs, as well as a USB port. The bed is very comfy which is perfect after a long day of sight seeing. The underground & bus stops are only a short walk away. The location is very good, very safe to walk at night. Also very close to shops/restaurants! We will definitely book at the Park Grand again.",4,2017,05,17
103,Nice hotel but tiny room,"We stayed in this hotel on a weekend trip to London. We had paid for a superior double room but the room was tiny. You could barely move in there. You could just about sit on the toilet in the bathroom as it was that small! the staff were pleasant, but for the price it was a lot of money for what you got ! ",3,2017,05,17
103,Quiet Hotel Perfect For Exploring London,"Not far from Paddington Station, this hotel is a quiet and affordable basecamp for exploring London.  Paddington Station has many Tube lines running to it, as well as the Heathrow Express (direct train from Heathrow) and other services. It makes it a central location for seeing all London has to offer. Although not spacious, it works well for its purpose. The biggest downfall space wise is the shower which is quite cramped, but it still worked.",5,2017,05,16
103,Stayed here for 4 days,"Had a very good stay at this hotel. We booked online & received an English breakfast included with our rate. Good location near paddington train & subway stations. Lots of restaurants in the area, our favourite pub is called the mitre. We will stay here again.",4,2017,05,15
103,Amazing hotel!!!,"Just got back from one night stay here with my boyfriend as it was our anniversary. Very easy to get to from Paddington station and lots of shops, restaurants and pubs near by. Checking in was very easy and the staff help to escort you and your luggage to your rooms. The lady on reception Emilia asked what our plans were for the day/night we mentioned we was here to celebrate our anniversary. She upgraded us to a deluxe room free of charge which was very nice of her. Rooms are lovely they were big enough for the both of us, everything you need in it had the best nights sleep! We popped out for a couple hours after we had checked in and came back to a lovely lovely surprise that Emilia had left us, on the bed made out of towels was a love heart, rose petals, a slice of cake, chocolates and a bottle of wine! Could not thank her enough for making this special for us!!! Lovely friendly staff we will definitely be back next time we stay in London!!! Once again thank you so much to Emilia and the staff at Paddington court hotel.",5,2017,05,14
103,Mr M,"Stayed here with 4 friends. I was very imressed with the Excellent service. The hotel was very clean, rooms were spotless and smelt fresh. Bathroom was a little on the small side but had a Great shower. All in all we really enjoyed our stay...well worth the price. I would definitely come again an also recommend to all.",5,2017,05,14
103,Wedding Anniversary Visit,"My husband had surprised me with a stay at Park Grand for our wedding anniversary which I was looking forward to after reading lovely reviews and it was a first trip after an illness.. So I had messaged the hotel a couple of times before the visit to let them know and to ask a couple of questions, but sadly never received a reply ( even though I saw they had been read ).
However, I travelled down ahead as hubby was working and checked in and was greeted by a lovely receptionist called Alice. The room was clean, and modern and quite comfortable. The only downside was our room was right above some fans so a little noise and for some reason our key cards went working so we had to go back down 3 times and get them re done each time. The hotel had plenty of staff around to help and were all very friendly.. It was in a lovely location ideal just down from Paddington Station.",4,2017,05,13
103,M. Brough,"Fantastic holiday at the Park Grand Paddington Court. The staff were professional and friendly and accessible. The room was clean and comfortable with excellent amenities. 
If I could I would award 10 'Stars' to the Park Grand!
Here's to our next Holiday with the Park Grand!
Cheers!",5,2017,05,13
103,Park Grand Stay,"Good location, staff excellent and welcoming. Breakfast choices and quality were very good. Like many London hotels this was a little cramped in the Bathroom. Room was clean, maintained, modern and everything needed was provided.
IF you want to do a walking tour of many of the key sights of London - this is a good location, less than 10 mins to Paddington as well.",4,2017,05,12
103,Mom and son trip.  ,My son and I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights.  We had a great time.  The hotel and hotel staff was amazing.   They gave us recommendations on where to visit.  Places the locals went.  The hotel was clean the room was comfortable.  It was close to the train station so that was definitely a plus.  I would definitely go back.   London was beautiful.  I'm so happy we went.  ,5,2017,05,11
103,Lovely experience,We had a lovely stay!Staff are very nice and so detailed! they new we Were celebrating our engagement..so we found our room with petals of roses &  the towels in the shape of swans and hearts ! ..... Thanks alot for the amazing detail!,4,2017,05,08
103,"Great jumping-off point, very small rooms","Unfortunately, I didn't even mean to stay here. I booked at the Park Grand Lancaster Gate, the booking got fouled up, and I was too tired to care. That wouldn't be such a big deal except the former is a 5-star hotel and this is a 4-star hotel, and the difference showed.

This would be a great hotel to stay at if you were going to be in your room only for sleeping and that was it. Our room, a superior double, was so small that we couldn't even open the door all the way, and if you wanted to sit at the desk, the bench would touch the bed. The closet was in a little vestibule at the entrance so you couldn't have the wardrobe open at the same time as the door to the room. They had an ironing board but I really think the only place with enough floor room to set it up would've been in the hall, and it took up a lot of the room for hanging things. Our room was in a building across the street from the main reception. Their lobby was too small, and the concierge was overwhelmed both times that we wanted to leave or retrieve bags. One family took nearly 15 minutes to get the bags that they'd left, leaving them in jeopardy of missing their train. All the staff was very nice, including the bellhop who carried our bags up the stairs to our room (no lift!), but they were way overworked, and the front desk clerks didn't have keys for the luggage room.

That said, our room was well-appointed; it had decent tea service, a heated tile floor in the bathroom (which greatly redeemed the whole situation in my mind), and a comfortable bed. The hotel's location is great for the price -- less than 10 minutes' walk from Paddington Station, and from there the Bakerloo or Circle line will take you right to all the action, as well as the Heathrow Express taking you straight to and from the airport (useful if you're there on business). The neighborhood is quiet and safe, so no troubles coming home in the dark or sleeping. The room includes use of a mobile phone with free calls and data, which would be very useful if you're navigating London and/or keeping in touch with a group. Just give yourself plenty of time if you need to deal with reception/concierge, and don't plan to get comfy in your room unless you're on the bed.",4,2017,05,08
103,Great personal attention!,"I stayed one night before the end of my vacation, selecting this hotel for the proximity to Paddington Station.  My receptionist Fatima was very pleasant and helpful. She gave me a complementary upgrade without my asking, and when I mentioned that I just wanted a small breakfast in the morning, she directed me to Leclerc & Laurent, a French cafe just around the corner.  Best croissant ever!

The room was modern and newly decorated, and the bathroom was updated and spotless.  I had a great sleep--no commotion in the halls and the building is a solid older construction, very well maintained.",5,2017,05,07
103,Nice Staff & great Value for Money,"We got this hotel due to a last minute change.

The staff (in particular a very proactive and nice attendant called Alice) welcomed us in the best possible way offering her constant and genuine assistance.

Rooms are nice anche comfortable with everything needed.

Breakfast is rich and cared with plenty of choice.

Position is simply perfect to enjoy the best of London.

Also the wi-fi service works fast and for free.",4,2017,05,07
103,Birthday trip with daughter,"Excellent location close to Paddington Station. Lots of nice little extras like leaving balloons/teddy on daughter's bed for her birthday, free wine, newspaper delivered, free phone for the weekend. Only downside was pillows could have been more comfortable. Just been refurbished, very smart, nice bathrooms",5,2017,05,07
103,Great hotel ,"The hotel is in a great location.  Great rates.  The breakfast was set up very nicely and was ample food.  Milk could have been colder

The staff was great.  Very helpful and friendly.  Xavier was awesome. Such a nice guy.  People like him make you want to come back.  ",5,2017,05,06
103,Second house,"I've been staying here in the last 3 months for work reasons. Nice rooms (bit small) with all comforts, very comfortable position, in a central but quit area. Special bravo for the italian reception staff and Alice",5,2017,05,05
103,Great stay in London,Very friendly and helpful staff.  Alice and Emilia made us feel very welcome and went out of their way to ensure our comfort.  Room is small but well appointed.  Great location for using train and tube.  Breakfast is full English breakfast buffet and offers everything you need to set you up for a day in London.,4,2017,05,05
103,Excellent value for money in great location,"On arrival I was greeted by a very friendly reception team and escorted to my room which was large, well presented and very clean.  The room was equipped with everything a traveller could need plus more.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable with plenty of pillows.  The shower pressure was excellent as was the array of toiletries including a shower cap :O)",5,2017,05,02
103,"Very convenient location, modern, clean, and good service","Conveniently located near Paddington station. The place is thoughtfully renovated, modern, very comfortable. Rooms are small. Some section of the facility has no elevators. So you may need to walk up a lot of stairs.",4,2017,05,01
103,"Great location, friendly staff","This hotel is at very good location near to Paddington Station and Kensington Gardens. I stayed there 4 ninghts.  It  deserves excellent reviews and star rating
The hotel staff were excellent, Especially , Fatima was very friendly and helpful. The Bulgarian bellboy was also very eager to help.
I will absolutely stay here again during my next visit!",5,2017,05,01
103,Kids first international trip!,"This was our first family trip with our two children, almost 2 year old and 6 month old. I fell in love with this hotel, it's very nice, but it was mostly for their service. I can honestly say this has been the best hotel i've ever stayed at, and i've traveled to about 8 different countries. As soon as we arrived, the staff helped with our bags, greeted our children (amazing, some people just ignore children), upgraded us to club, and helped with our stroller. Vicente (I think was his name) walked us to our room, showed us how the lights, ac, and phone worked. He then told us that we could leave our stroller in the desk area so that it wouldn't be taking up space in our room. The room had a complimentary bottle of wine, cell phone, and water for the first day. Later that evening one of the ladies brought us a cute little stuffed bear for our babies. They were so excited! This included the full english breakfast every morning (which was delicious) and at the front desk they had cute little complimentary desserts (one day was cake pops, others small brownies, and so on). The best part was that everyone was so welcoming and helpful. They also remembered who we were. Bogdan (I believe was his name) was the best. He was at the front desk each day we were there and always greeted us with a smile, helped us with the stroller down the front steps, opened the stroller, helped put the baby in, and was so sweet. I know the next time we're in London, we will definitely be staying here again! The location was great as well, we were right by Paddington station and there were so many cute restaurants. Hyde park is a five minute walk from the hotel!",5,2017,04,25
103,Very recommended!!!!,"Been to Park Grand Paddington Court, great hotel, clean and comfortable room (even though small), well accessorized, very nice staff, ready to answer your every question or request. The location is excellent as well, only five minutes walk to the underground station.
In short, we had great time, definitely come again!!!!",5,2017,04,25
103,Pleasant hotel with friendly staff,"We had a pleasant stay with my husband at this hotel. Even though the hotel room was a little bit dark due to very small window and lack of natural light. The breakfast was enjoyable and the staff was very helpful and friendly. Distance to either Paddington or Bayswater tube station was not very long and it was nice to walk after meal.

The most memorable experience was a little treat from the staff on my husband´s birthday",4,2017,04,24
103,👍🏼👍🏼,"8 min. Walking from paddington station 
New modern design rooms
Free phone device in the room you can use it during your stay with free internet and free calls for chosen countries
Its a bit far from the center of London but if you like to walk you'll enjoy walking to Hyde Park the you can oxford street or shortcut the park to reach Buckingham Palace. ",4,2017,04,24
103,Perfect London Stay!! ,"What can I say, a lovely centrally located hotel that really made our city break that little bit better. We were staying in London for 2 nights this easter, everything was perfect from start to finish, staff went out of their way to meet our requests and always had a smile. 
Closest station is Paddington which is roughly a 4 min walk, more importantly you felt safe walking in the area. Plenty of shops and restraunts close aswell. 
Breakfast was lovely, combination of continental and hot brekki! 
Yes rooms were small (as expected in this area of London) but bearable and space was used well, very clean. Tip - we asked for a 2nd ground room to avoid the basement!  Will deffo stay at this hotel again :)! 
Thank you Park Grand for our wonderful stay, Hanna and Finley xx ",4,2017,04,23
103,Boutique hotel located just 5 minute walk from Paddington Statiom,"We arrived at our initial hotel of The Park Grand London Paddington to be informed that the boiler had broken & the staff relocated us to the Park Grand Paddington Court just a few yards down the road.

What can we say.......wonderful hotel & warm greeting received from the reception staff, namely Alissa! Alissa was fantastic, even upgrading our room & asked what the purpose of our visit was, to which we informed her that it was my partner's birthday. 
We thought nothing more of it & were shown to our Club Suite.

Immaculately tidy, great sized room with all amenities & the bathroom was perfect! The shower was wonderful and luxurious! 

We headed out to explore London & returned to our room later that evening to find a wonderful surprise! The towels were made into swans, decorated with rose petals, a cake & a card from Alissa!
Truly wonderful surprise & very kind of Alissa to remember our earlier comment about my partner's birthday!
Beds were very comfortable & temperature of the room was managed with an easy to use air conditioning.

We ate our complimentary breakfast the next 2 mornings in the restaurant, requiring a short wait to be seated as the restaurant didn't appear to be big enough to cope with the demand of customers requiring seating, however the staff were working non-stop to ensure tables were cleared & tidy & food was in plentiful supply!

Overall a wonderful boutique hotel, great location to the station & would stay again!",5,2017,04,23
103,Quick overnight stay,Highlight was nice check in with free use of Android device which lets you make calls and have internet service while out and about.   clean comfortable bed and bathroom.  Not much of a view as we were in the basement level.  Great licatiin to Paddington ,4,2017,04,23
103,"Nice and quiet hotel, Spacious!",We spent one night here when we had short layover on our way back home. The room had 2 double beds and very clean and specious. The front desk staff were nice. Breakfast buffet was pretty good too. The most impressive service was they provided a cell phone for us and it's free to call and use the data. It was very helpful and I have never seen this service from any hotel before. I will definitely stay here again when I go back to London.,5,2017,04,23
103,Comfortable!,"This hotel was very appropriate for our accommodation. Very close the Paddington station where you can get all public transportation going around London and other cities.  The room is located across the main building, very roomy for the three of us, bedding sets very nice. Free water,  fruits and soda on the first day. Free phone with Internet, robes and slippers. Breakfast was good with different varieties although they might need to change selection every day. My only frustration was that too many doors and narrow hallway going to our room, and construction noises. Staff very helpful and friendly. Will definitely go back.",3,2017,04,22
103,Great Hotel,"My wife and I spent four days at the hotel during the first week of April. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was perfect for a short stay and the location is great since it is close to Paddington Station. Totally recommended!",5,2017,04,20
103,"Lovely Hotel, Close to Tube, Small Modern Rooms","Stayed here over 4 days including easter weekend.  We upgraded to the club room which is still small by American standards, but was fine for the 2 of us.

Hotel is a 5 minute walk from the tube stop. You can take the train from heathrow, If you have alot of luggage the taxi will take you for about 4 pounds.  We felt comfortable walking alone at night.

Most things close early except the angus steak house by paddington station

We arrived early and they let us check in, They did the same for another person in our party.  Checkin was smooth and friendly.

The hotel has an elevator, but not there is a floor which it doesn't go to so the bellman carried our bags up with no issues. If you are plus sized or have other issues I would call the hotel to confirm you need a room with elevator access or on the first floor.

The club room came with a phone we  could use for phone and looking things up we ended up just using our own phones.

The room had a american outlet, however it never worked for us and since we had adapters it wasn't a big deal.

The bathroom had heated floors which seems great but we ended up not using very much as it got to hot.

We got two beds and they were twins (versus full in the states) it was ok for 4 nights.  

We used viator (trip advisor excursion site) and for that you needed to print out your vouchers and reception said they didn't have  a printer, so we had to email them and the they people behind the desk printed them.  It was mildly annoying, but they worked with us. Amalia was exceptionally patient.  There is somewhere in the literature that says the lounge has a printer and computer so not sure what that was about. 

Zdravko was the bellman who took out luggage up and down  the stairs.  He was extremely friendly, helpful explaining everything in our room and suggested an outlet mall as an alternative to shoppingin central london

Overall we would definitely visit again.  Lovel staff and establishment,",4,2017,04,20
103,Superb stay,"Stayed at this hotel for two nights. From the minute we walked through the door we were greeted by friendly staff, who were very helpful. We were upgraded to a club room free of charge, the upgraded room which we stayed in was lovely. Every member of staff we walked past around the hotel were pleasant and always made conversation.

The hotel is a 5 minute walk away from Paddington station so its in an excellent location to get around using the London underground.

We would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,04,20
103,Amazing hotel!!!,"Booked for 1 night for my boyfriend's birthday and we were so impressed with the hotel! Super friendly staff, great facilities and an amazing room. They'd even laid out balloons and cake! Will definitely be returning! ",5,2017,04,18
103,Lovely Stay!,"Me and my boyfriend have just returned from a one night stay at this hotel. As we were celebrating his birthday the hotel surprised us with a free upgrade to a club room which was extremely modern and quite big.
They had gone that extra mile to make a birthday cake out of towels,  write a card and left a slice of cake in our room for our arrival. It was also one of the best night’s sleep I have ever had as the bed was so big and comfy!
The hotel is in a very good location, a 5 minute walk from Paddington but we also did quite a bit of walking and walked from Euston to the hotel and also Buckingham palace to the hotel. The hotel also has bikes you can hire right outside the door so if you are fed up of walking, this is very convenient!
We did not have breakfast at the hotel but there are plenty of places to go to, we took a walk into Chelsea and had breakfast in a quaint little café.
A visit to Kensington Gardens/Hyde park is a must.
Thankyou to the hotel for making my boyfriend’s birthday celebrations and Easter weekend so lovely!",5,2017,04,18
103,Short stay but a great room,"We were originally booked at a sister property down the street but arrived to learn that due to an issue with their hot water boiler, we were moved to the Paddington Court. They gave us a larger sized Club Room and threw in breakfast which was great! We were only in the city for two days but at least we had a comfortable, modern room. Rooms in London are on the small-side if you are used to North American accommodations but as far as London rooms go, this was large. Decor was lovely and modern. The bathroom had heated floors (a plus in the coolish weather) and we had all the TV channels we would wish for.  The breakfast buffet was great, lots of options and the service staff whether cleaners or front desk or in the restaurant were friendly and helpful. Paddington as a location is very convenient; only a short walk to Hyde Park or Kensington Gardens as well as the train station and underground. Price was very reasonable.",4,2017,04,17
103,Short break,My daughters and I was in London to see the Motown the Musical. We had the pleasure of stay at this hotel. We were greeted on arrival by a very pleasant lady called Alice who was helpful. There were porters who helped with taking the luggage to our room.The room small but had everything we needed also we had a bottle of wine soft drinks and fresh fruit in our room. There was also a small microwave in our room. Breakfast was very nice especially the sausages. There wasn't any fried eggs so we asked one of the staff and they ordered them for us. Nothing was ever a problem for the hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be coming back again.,5,2017,04,17
103,Mrs Aishah ,"Nothing can stop me from booking each time in this amazing hotel. Seriously, I call it the ""comfortable home"" where I have my privacy and confidential. Thank you Park Grand Paddington. You deserve the best ",5,2017,04,17
103,"Attending Book Launch ""The Boy Who Gave His Heart Away"" in memory of my Son Marc McCay","The location of this hotel is excellent, Edgware Road & Paddington underground & Paddington Station are nearby, Hyde Park just a short walk, Marble Arch & lots of shops & places to eat from every imaginable country, Location perfect.

From our arrival staff were friendly, attentive, informative and treated us like VIP's, our room was spotless thanks to a very happy smiling friendly housekeeper, the room had all amenities and more! I had lost my mobile phone and there in our room was a Smart phone and free wifi for me to connect to my family via facebook and email, very comfortable bed and the shower was excellent.
Breakfast was The Best catering for every nationality, the friendly attentive staff made it even more enjoyable, by the 2nd morning the smiling lovely waiter knew our order for tea & coffee, the staff were constantly replenishing the cooked food and fresh fruit, well done to all.
The young man who ordered our taxi to leave stood out amongst all the staff, during our visit he was informative, compassionate and nothing was any bother.",5,2017,04,16
103,"Great cosy,comfortable luxury stay","My partner and i stayed here on a small honeymoon break, got a premier room in the building across road from the main hotel,(quiet area) small and compact could be said, but everything you need in the room, air con/heating,TV,double bed,microwave,tea/coffee making facilities,iron board,hair drier,safe,black out curtains, beautiful clean warm bathroom(under floor heating-tiles) with waterfall+normal shower option, free cell phone/smart phone with unlimited internet to take with you from the hotel to navigate around city and make calls-all free included in hotel stay price.!

Hotel was safe and quiet, 5 minute walk from Paddington station.",5,2017,04,16
103,Combined business & leisure trip,"Hotel staff were extremely welcoming & pleasant. Room wasn't huge but had everything required including a small fridge. Breakfast was plentiful with a wide range of choices to suit all tastes. Well worth the 5 minute walk from Paddington station. Lots of Bars & restaurants nearby, also worth a visit is Kensington Gardens a 5 minute walk away.",4,2017,04,15
103,"Excellent - great location, quiet and 3 blocks from Central/District line Underground","Newly refurbished, modern. Room typical for London - smallish but very comfortable. Staff couldn't have been better, would stay there again tomorrow! Easy walk to Paddington Underground for perfect quick access to all of Central London",5,2017,04,14
103,Overpriced shoebox,"We booked this hotel for a 2 night stay due to its proximity to Paddington and the Heathrow express.the photos are misleading regarding the room size.  Reception staff were blunt & rude on check in. They insisted on full payment upfront which we paid but were very surprised about this practise and they insisted on formal identification ( passport) which they took a copy of!  Our room was tiny! My husband is 6ft3 and his legs were dangling off the bed. The doors slam so we were constantly aware of people coming & going from their rooms at all hours of the night. Our double deluxe bed had to be pushed up against the wall which meant it was impossible to walk down that side of the bed and I had to climb in from the end of the bed. The thermostat cannot be modified the controls are either broken or locked so they can't be changed the room was so hot we were sweating! 
The wet room ( can't call it a bathroom) was the tiniest thing I've ever seen. The door had to open outwards into the ""hallway"" and the sides of the bath tub were so high I hate to think how an elderly person would ever be able to get in there without serious injury. There is a glass springloaded screen which does nothing to prevent the water from ending up on the floor. And it swings back on you constantly when you've opened it to try and get in or out of the tub! There was hardly anywhere to open our suitcases and nowhere to put our toiletries. It is by far the smallest room I've ever stayed in and was far from relaxing!  After the shock of our tiny room and even smaller bathroom ( I had to leave the bathroom door open to enable enough room to get in and out of the shower and to bend over to put my hair in a towel!).  We decided to try the restaurant. I use this term lightly!  We were told that they had a restaurant onsite and we had paid for breakfast to be included. So we started heading to where they served breakfast..... down huge flight of stairs to the basement. Subterranean dining hmmm. Only to be told that that is not the restaurant the bar is the restaurant. The bar consisted of a small bar with approx 6 -7 small tables with rickety chairs and tables. We actually moved tables as the first one we sat at was so wobbly we expected to collapse before our eyes. The ""menu"" was limited. Consisting of about 6 versions of biriyan ( which we do t like at all) or a burger or fish and chips. I ordered the fish and chips. It was awful. The fish was dry and overcooked and the batter was so soggy it was falling off the fish. The chips were also soggy. It seemed they all been precooked then stuck in the microwave! Yuk! The burger was dry and overcooked as well and we had the privilege of paying £27 for this! The breakfast in the basement was not much better. Overcooked sausages that were shrivelled . No proper coffee (espresso) just instant . So we ordered a pot of tea that was plonked on our table when other guests had their cups filled up for them. So we just poured our own. We tried several times to catch the attention of the wait staff to clear our plates so we could put our fruit plates on the table but we're ignored so we had to squish them in and eat around them. We could not wait to leave. Staff are very inattentive we were basically ignored. Wouldn't recommend this hotel at all. Save your money and go somewhere else.",1,2017,04,13
103,Compact but great! ,"The room was a bit small with the bed on the small side for a double. Other than that, the hotel was lovely and so reasonably priced I couldn't believe it! 
118 pounds for a one night stay including breakfast so centrally located - I'll definitely be back!!

A word of warning for weary travellers though - room service stopped at 8.30pm! ",4,2017,04,12
103,Great boutique hotel close to town and Heathrow,"I travel constantly in the ME and SEA. I rarely recommend hotels as the rooms and service is so inconsistent. On this occasion I am happy to do so. The room was great. All I ask for is a comfy firm bed and great plumbing. The rest is frills. The frills were nice too.

This is a boutique hotel with a difference....the helpful friendly staff for whom nothing is a drama and overall value. Not pretentious but everything works. Stay there and you are unlikely to be unsatisfied with proximity to the Heathrow Express and Paddington station as well as about 6 stops from theatre land, art galleries and Chinatown. Loved it. Coming back very soon. Thanks.

",5,2017,04,11
103,It was OK,"Arrived at 1:45pm so didn't expect room to be ready and were prepared to leave luggage and return later. Initially pleasantly surprised to be offered an alternative to the room we were destined for (103) so went over the road to the basement room they reallocated to us (553). It was a very dark and very small double. We booked a 'deluxe double' and this was far from deluxe. My wardrobe at home is bigger than the ensuite bathroom in this room.  The bed was pushed up against the window which looked out onto a courtyard where staff were sorting laundry. The net curtain was ripped and the wallpaper was peeling away from the wall as a result of what looked like a damp issue. The doors didn't close properly on the kitchenette and to be honest that unit took up far too much valuable space in such a small room.  We had lots of luggage with us as London was the second stop of a multi centre break and we could hardly move around the room without either bumping into suitcases, furniture or each other. 

We spoke to reception and asked if the original room allocated to us (103) was still available as we were not at all comfortable with 553. We were invited to take a look at the room and decided instantly that this was a significant improvement. They kindly arranged to move our luggage over so that we could head into London to start our visit.  

On our return we found some complimentary fruit in the room with a note of apology, a nice touch.  This room had a lovely shower and large bright windows making it feel spacious. Plenty of wardrobe space and room to move around our luggage.  Bed was comfortable and there was a nice big tv on the wall. 

Breakfast was buffet style and it was ok. Choice of breads, pastries, cereals, English  and continental breakfast options. Some of the seats were a bit tatty and the newspapers were a day old when we had breakfast on Friday morning. Staff were polite, helpful and smart.  

Great location for Paddington station & underground (approx 5 min walk) and even quicker walk to Hyde Park.  Really good Italian restaurant Bizarro on the walk between the hotel & station. NatWest and HSBC branches near the station with free ATM's. 

Something the hotel had no control over, hence us not taking it up with them during our stay, was Room 103 looks out on to the street where refuse/recycling is collected very early each morning so we were woken by crashing & banging of bins and glass bottles. Also, we think the room is adjacent to a private residence and they had a house party playing extremely loud music until 3am on Sunday morning. Needless to say that whilst the bed was very comfortable, the decor, light and space in the room was nice, I didn't sleep well during my stay. 

This review is titled ""It was OK"" which sums up our stay. I can't say I wouldn't stay here again; I would try and stay away from rooms 553 and 103 and hope for the best.",3,2017,04,11
103,Tiny room but had everything you need,"I booked a room at the last minute via Hotel Tonight and got a good rate. But, the room was really compact to say the least (room 615 in building no. 3). You could pretty much stand in one spot and reach everything - at least that's very efficient! On the positive side, the room was clean, in good condition and had everything you need. 

I was a little surprised that the room was actually in the building across the road, but no big deal.",3,2017,04,09
103,Will Return,"We stayed for one night in Club Room 24 which was quite as requested, nice size room, some interesting features such as under floor heating in the bathroom, the option of a hand held show head or using the fixed overhead unit, a night light, a mobile phone guests can use with a city map and free calls. We didn't use the phone as we are from the UK but it seemed a really good concept. I was impressed that a member of staff gave a quick overview of the rooms features which was a nice touch. We didn't have breakfast, we popped up to Starbucks in Paddington Station. The hotel is well situated, a straightforward walk to Paddington Mainline and Tube, easy reach of Central London (15-20mins) to Oxford Circus. Lancaster Gate on the Central Line is nearby but I believe closed until July (check with reception). It is also a short walk to Hyde Park which leads to a nice walk to the Albert hall. Staff were really helpful, subject to pricing this will be our go to hotel when visiting London.",5,2017,04,08
103,Lovely anniversary break,"We stayed here for two nights for our 3 year anniversary as we were going to see Les Miserables. The room was lovely and they gave us a free upgrade to a club room which included fluffy robes, fresh fruit and a lovely bottle of red wine. On the second day they also treated us to some gorgeous Swan towel art, rose petals and a cake to share. The staff are very friendly and helpful and everything was of a high standard. Breakfast was very tasty and plentiful and the waitresses attentive. The bed was huge and very comfortable with lots of extra nice touches such as toothbrushes, razor and nice toiletries in the bathroom and large towels. Would definitely stay again and recommend. Thanks to all staff for looking after us do well. ",4,2017,04,08
103,The ups outweigh the downs,"I stayed here for 1 night with my partner, parents and child.
We booked a double and family room.
After a lengthy, but I'm guessing thorough, check-in we were given our room keys and directed to the suites across the road.
When we arrived the third bed in our room hadn't been made up, however, the reception staff were happy to rectify this while we were out at the theatre using a taxi they booked for us.
On our return to the hotel, on of our party was unwell and, once again, the staff were prompt and professional in their care of my mum and the cleaning on their room.
The breakfast was varied, hot and of a good standard with staff who were attentive but not intrusive.
As this was a special occasion we had ordered a celebration cake for the room which didn't materialise, the apologetic manager was happy to refund us for this as well as pay for a taxi to our destination the next morning.
Overall, this was a great experience and we cannot fault the staff and their services.
The air-conditioning in the room was a massive plus for my partner.",4,2017,04,08
103,Great choice,"The staff was so nice, rooms are clean. It was a great choice. And a BIG THANK Fatime for her kindness. Breakfast was very delicious. Easy to travel to the city with underground, wonderful restaurants on the neighbourhoods. Greetings from Hungary .",5,2017,04,07
103,Disappointing,"Took a trip to London in January and stayed in Park Grand for two nights. 

We were put in a ground floor room, which was very dark and it's big windows made it quite chilly. So chilly in-fact that they had put a plug in heater in our room and I had it on basically the whole two nights of our stay and when getting ready to go out in the evenings. Also being on the ground floor meant we were woke up both mornings by the sounds of commuters heading to work as the footpath was right outside our window. We didn't get our room restocked on the second day (most hotels come in and make the beds, restock bathroom necessities and refreshments) which I found to be a disappointment. 

My partner also got an extra £80 took out of his account after he had paid the hotel? It got refunded but it was lucky that he noticed it on his bank statement!

Loved London, but won't be back to stay at this hotel.",2,2017,04,06
103,A nice hotell with very friendly staff,"We had a nice stay. The breakfast was very good and the staff was helpful and friendly. There was a city bike stop right outside the hotel, witch made it easy to get down to the city center. The rooms was a bit small, but they were nice and clean.",4,2017,04,06
103,3 Day London Trip ,"Came to London for a 3 day visit with my teenage daughter. After careful consideration I chose this hotel. What a find! a lovely hotel only a 10 min easy walk from Paddington tube station which connects quickly and easily to all of the sights in London. We were busy most days in Hyde Park again a 10 min stroll away, Royal Albert Hall an easy tube ride and shopping in Oxford Street either a walk across Hyde Park or a tube journey.  
Our room (no.125) even though compact was beautifully appointed as was the bathroom. There were no noise issues and came back late one night to a slice of chocolate cake and card from Alba (Reception) for my daughters birthday.  The breakfast room even though down in the basement was a lovely light room, the staff were v.attentive and the food delicious. 
The porters and reception staff were friendly and helpful. I cannot fault this hotel and would return if we plan another trip to London without hesitation.
",5,2017,04,05
103,More than you expect,"The hotel is quite, very clean and comfortable and the breakfast is very good. There are facilities for tea and coffee. The hotel is renovated and everything looks new and by this one could disregard relatively small single room. Excellent staff and the senior concierge Zdravko and ladies from the reception has made me feel spoiled.",4,2017,04,05
103,"Excellent hotel, very nice staff","Very nice place, extremely helpful staff, Valent at the Reception has done everything to get us into our room as quick as possible. Small, but nice room, very clean and comfortable. We had a room on the street side, but we were not disturbed by any noise, maybe because it was the 4th floor and/or the double glazing.
Complimentary water, cookies and coffee/tea making facilities (AND a microwave oven) in the room!
Breakfast is really delicious, there is a good selection of hot an cold food. Very nice, very helpful staff.
We would definitely come back again.",5,2017,04,04
103,Very surprising hotel!,"The Park Grand Paddington Court exceeded my expectations! 

The breakfast very good.
The attention of the hotel members very good.
The room was perfect, with coffe and tea facilites, just renoved bathroom with good qualities and very clean. The room was a bit small, as usual in London. I've been in some ""apartments"" even smaller than this room. I spoke about it with the receptionist and told me that triple room or twin rooms are a bit bigger than double rooms.

And the extra point: in the room there is a mobile phone for you to carry all around London with free local calls and internet!! This made my day when I wanted to know how to any place by metro/bus with all the indications in my hand.",4,2017,04,04
103,Super!,"What a great place to stay.  I was here for 5 nights and loved it.  Super comfy bed, great staff, Heated bathroom Floor!!.  Quiet, clean and really enjoyable. Microwave and mini-fridge too!   And, a free smartphone to use while I was in London.  They really go above and beyond",4,2017,04,03
103,Park Grand,Great hotel and great location. A nice hot fresh breakfast is offered. Rooms are not all the same size we had a smaller room and was offered an upgrade to a larger size. Zdravko was very nice and helpful.  It shows that he loves his job and wants the guest to be happy. He showed us our room and helped us with our luggage. The US charger is offered in the room and they offer a smart phone to use during the stay free of charge. Very nice experience.,5,2017,04,01
103,"Great room, lovely staff","My boyfriend and I visited this hotel for 3 days in March and couldn't recommend it enough. The hotel has been recently renovated and is very clean. The room is quite small but not tiny, and has everything you need - and the bed is the comfiest bed I have ever slept in! And the heated floor in the bathroom is a very nice touch too. 
The hotel is less than 5 min walk to Paddington tube station, so very handy to get anywhere you need to go in London. 
Also, thanks to the staff for the lovely birthday surprise!",5,2017,03,31
103,Enjoyable stay !,"I really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very near to Paddington Station in a quiet street.  The staff is excellent. My single room was small but ok for 1 person. There's tea and coffee and biscuits for breakfast in the room, free of charge. Cleaning service excellent as well. I can really recommend this hotel.",5,2017,03,31
103," week end ","I had a beautiful time in this place , very lovely room as they upgrade me complimentary  and amazing service !
Alice , The lady at the reception was so kind and very able to help us in every way. 
Hope to come to come back soon !
Strongly recommended! ",5,2017,03,29
103,Great hotel,"I really loved staying here for 3 nights. The staff were so pleasant, helpful, insisted on carrying my bags to the room. It was a single room, modern, large bathroom., comfortable bed, good linen. For my convenience there is a mini fridge, a microwave, Crockery, cutlery. Kettle with teabags, biscuits, bottled water etc. very quiet and convenient location near Paddington. Would definitely go back there. Great staff. Great experience ",5,2017,03,26
103,"Convenient hotel, friendly staff","We had never been to London before and we were not sure what to expect.  The hotel is a combination of buildings that have been combined.  The rooms were comfortable, although a bit small.  Getting to our room entailed climbing a few steps and crossing the breakfast/ bar room, then climbing several flights of stairs, then down a short set of stairs, and then down a long all with a 90 degree turn.

The room was clean and comfortable, and a free cell phone was provided that we could carry while touring London (great idea)

The staff was always friendly and accommodating.  

While the location was great, and we would stay here again if we were travelling light - at my age getting our luggage to the front desk over all of the steps was quite a chore.",4,2017,03,25
103,Exceeded expectations,"Hotel exceeded my expectations. Room was new and modern, as well as all the hotel facilities. Breakfast was probably the best part with a really good full English breakfast plus continental options. Staff was key - very helpful! Liked the free smartphone option, even though I did not use it. Prices a bit above average... Keep up the good work!",5,2017,03,25
103,Some small improvements would make all the difference!! ,"We arrived very late at the hotel after a long day and couldn't wait for our heads to hit the pillow.
The check in was quick and easy, the gentleman at reception was very friendly.
The room was larger than I expected, and all seemed good, I was looking forward to a good nights sleep.
As I got into bed I noticed there was a banging noise every 30 seconds or so... at this stage it was 1.30am and I was just too tired to move and investigate the noise. I managed to get some sleep however was awoken numerous times by this banging.
In the morning I discovered that it was the window making the noise, it was an old window and the wind was causing it to make a continuous banging sound.

I also attempted to make a call to reception in the morning to ask for an iron, however the phone was broken so I walked down. 

Just a little more TLC would turn this hotel into a fantastic one!!!!! ",3,2017,03,23
103,Birthday Suprise,"I have planned a trip to London as a birthday present to my girlfriend. There was chocolate cake waiting for her in the room and a ""cake"" made out of towels. I haven't told the hotel staff to do this, they did it on there own and it was a great surprise.",5,2017,03,20
103,Very small rooms,We experienced really bad service and were forced to change rooms because my room was next to an extremely loud generator in the basement. The rooms were very small. I would not recommend but other travellers may have had a different experience. Would not stay there again.,2,2017,03,17
103,Great Service,The staff at the hotel were brilliant - so kind and helpful. The hotel was very clean and tidy with everything you could want. A very comfortable night's sleep and a lovely stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted support with their stay.,5,2017,03,15
103,"Great value refurbished hotel, close to Paddington, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens","We had a great deal with the Park Grand Paddington Court, paying only £90 for the two of us including breakfast!  Our double room was spacious, especially by central London standards and for the price we paid.  The decor was fresh and modern, the bed comfy, a lovely bathroom with nice toiletries, a powerful shower over the bath and plenty of towels (and room to swing the proverbial cat!!).  Our room was in the ""suites"", across the road from the main reception.  The hotel itself is a 5 minute stroll from Paddington, and given its close proximity, there was very little, if any noise, and we slept well.  Unfortunately, we just didn't give ourselves time in the morning and had to forgo breakfast - plenty of apples in reception to snack on though!  As we had a function to attend, we wanted somewhere where we could leave our luggage for the day and hot foot it back to our train in Paddington in the evening.  This worked out really well.  The final most important thing, is how friendly and welcoming the staff are.  Really, nothing is too much trouble and everyone we met was a delight.  I would recommend the Park Grand Paddington Court, and would definitely stay there again.  Thank you!",5,2017,03,15
103,"Modern, clean and good service","Modern, clean and comfortable hotel. Well situated to access Paddington Station and easy reach for Hyde Park. Within short walking distance to attend function at Lancaster Gate. Staff were helpful and friendly. Will definitely return when in the area again. Overall good value for money",5,2017,03,14
103,Some Rooms On Small Side But Very Clean And Well Appointed.,"As title, and other reviews will tell you, many of the rooms are quite small, too small really and certainly for the money. I cannot knock the cleanliness, quite the opposite, rooms have everything you want within reason except room! 
The staff are all friendly, professional and helpful, breakfast is not a fill up for the day but adequate and good quality. I would stay here again, but would want a better price.",4,2017,03,14
103,Fantastic Hotel!,"From checking in to checking out, this hotel was brilliant. All the staff were very polite and could not do enough to help. After a day of sightseeing I returned home to find a note on my bed wishing me a Happy Birthday. There were also balloons, a clever birthday cake made out of towels and a slice of chocolate cake. The hotel is in a brilliant location right next to restaurants and it took us about 5 minutes to walk to Paddington station. The room was lovely with lots of little extras and was spacious. The buffet style breakfast was also very good. I must say that this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at and will definitely recommend to my friends and family. If I do need a hotel in London again, I would definitely return. It has made my birthday weekend in London very pleasant. The staff are a credit to the hotel!",5,2017,03,13
103,"Small, cosey hotel ","A weekend away with my boyfriend in London. It was his first time in London.
Hotel is very modern and clean. We booked a compact double room , which was absolutely tiny. We are not a tall couple yet the bed would only fit a child- so make sure to book a bigger double room. We asked to be moved to a bigger room which we were accommodated .
Very central location, a 3-5 minute walk to Paddington station and only a few stops from central London. 
Hotel bar is very small- so not really ideal for drinks. 
Breakfast is very nice & staff are superb! 
I would recommend this hotel for a short and busy London trip ",4,2017,03,13
103,Clean and comfortable,"The hotel is 5-10 minutes to the Paddington metro station by walking. We were very pleased about the hotel room, which was at the ground floor, but very quiet and comfortable. The room we stayed at was very clean and spacious enough for 2. The staff was very friendly and helpful. You receive newspaper and chocolate ever day as well :) I definitely recommend the hotel, and also the Indian Restaurant close to it.",5,2017,03,13
103,Park Grand or Paddington Court,"Booked Paddington Court Executive Rooms, but were checked in to the Park Grand London Paddington, which is on the opposite of the street. Room is small despite the fact that it was a club room. But everything else is good. Very clean, and on a quiet street. Our room was next to the lift, but not much noise which was surprisingly good. English breakfast, simple but sufficient, in the basement. Staff is friendly and helpful. Location wise, it is a short walk to the Paddington station, but if you carry large luggage, it is still some difficult as the road condition, the pedestrians, etc. Needs some improvements. Other metro station is even further away. Quite many eateries around the area toward Edgware Road. Overall, a nice stay.",4,2017,03,12
103,Worlds Smallest Rooms,"The hotel is in a wonderful location, it is clean and nicely decorated but wow the rooms are so so tiny! 

We had 2 rooms, my mum and dad in one and my husband and I in the other. We stayed for my birthday and they provided balloons and cake which was lovely. 

The reception staff were really slow to book you in, I think we had a trainee but it took around 15 minutes. 

The rooms are too small, it's not a case of 'well you're hardly in them' even just getting ready and sleeping, they are too small. My husband and I are not over average height and we are both slim in size and we were both on the edge of the bed nearly falling out, it is barely larger than a single and is pushed right up against the wall so you have room to stand on the floor.

We said when checking out about the size of the room and she said 'if you had of said we would have moved you' we should have to say, you should put people in the normal size rooms unless fully booked or single occupancy. 

Very disappointed as the hotel is in a great location but disappointed by the size of the rooms and the front desk service. ",3,2017,03,12
103,Brilliant stay! ,"Great location and lovely hotel. Good value for money with a lovely breakfast too. Staff were friendly and welcoming in hotel and helped us book a trip to London eye. Room was a good size and beds comfy. A amazing find and would definitely stay again if I went to London. The hotel even gave all
Ladies a flower to celebrate international woman's day! Lovely atmosphere and shower is amazing too! ",5,2017,03,11
103,The best value around Paddington,"As an avid traveler who loves stopping in London I usually prefer the convenience of Paddington Station. I also have experienced all kinds of hotels around the area. From those 5 stars to the typical bed and breakfast.
Gran Paddington has it all. The service and attention of a 5 star hotel, the crew is magnificent, the internet is the fastest I have experienced for free, and the location is just perfect.
My room was 14 square meters, absolutely confortable, with a refrigerator and coffee. Very private and gave me the feeling of staying in my own house. Of course with somebody cleaning the room for me :)",5,2017,03,07
103,Love it here!,"It's my second time in this great hotel and I came back because the first experience was great. Now again here I am sure to come back again next month. The staff is friendly and attentive, the location is great and the room is awesome! Very cozy, clean and pretty! It was really striking to me that they gave me the same room I stayed in the first time when I requested! Since I'm staying to basically write and get some escape from the daily chaotic life, the room is very important because I mostly stay in. I really liked the room and the fact that I could request to stay there again and be attended just made the experience even better!",5,2017,03,07
103,Fabulous birthday celebration stay,"Stayed one night to celebrate my birthday. Staff went above and beyond by making the most amazing 'cake' out of towels decorated with real flowers, scattered balloons on the bed and left a slice of delicious cake big enough to share on the dresser! Comfortable sleep except for the pillows. Nicely appointed bathroom and wonderful quality fluffy towels. Breakfast was included and there was a great choice available,",5,2017,03,06
103,Weekend break with the family,"We had two rooms during this stay. Rather small rooms, but in perfect condition.
Extremey helpfull reception staff, nice breakfast, so nothing more to ask.
The location is on reasonable walking distance from Paddington Station, so as a base for visiting London, it's quite convenient.

I can certainly recommend this hotel.",4,2017,03,06
103,Weekend break with friends.,"This hotel is fabulous beautiful rooms bathrobes slippers fruit wine water tea and coffee cosmetics in bathroom .We stayed bed and breakfast the breakfast was fabulous ,Buffet style large selection the best thing about this hotel is the staff ,friendly , accommodating couldn't do enough for you it's a definite we will return ,Thankyou for a lovely stay .",5,2017,03,04
103,Very good hotel. Excellent staff.,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The rooms and bathroom were on the small side - but they are well appointed, clean and comfortable.
The service is excellent. All staff are polite and efficient. I would like to make special mention of Zdravko, the concierge,. He remembered that we were celebrating my wife's birthday and arranged for flowers and cake in our room.",5,2017,03,04
103,Best for Heathrow Express,"I stayed here for 7 nights last month. I would recommend it to travelers coming via Heathrow Express. On arrival at Paddington Station, exit via London Street (next to WH Smith), turn right to Hilton Hotel and keep walking until you cut Devonshire Terrace and hotel is right in front of you.  Takes 8-10 min walk depending on traffic lights.  No need for taxi transfers. Just make sure your suitcases have good wheels.  Breakfast is plentiful and wholesome. Deluxe twin room happens to be very small with a tiny bathroom. But I can adapt to the small size as I have stayed in even smaller rooms before. Very quiet. No traffic noise, only hear wind banging on window frames. Clean and modern. Good WiFi. Adjustable in-room temperature. Close to restaurants in main street. Sainsbury's Local inside Paddington Station,  Feb is still the low season, so price per night is still OK. Three big bonuses I would like to mention: 1) I arrived at 7:00am and my room was ready! What a pleasant surprise for a weary traveler! 2) My Iphone went on strike for one full day. And in each room, they provide for free an In Focus smartphone with unlimited mobile data. It's a perfect rescue to my plight! I used it for email and google map etc. Battery drains very fast, Best to have a portable power bank with you.3) 15-min walk to Our Lady of Rosary Church at Edgware for Sunday masses. And even more surprises, I was invited to collect donation even though I was a first-timer there. Overall, I was happy.",4,2017,03,02
103,"Helpful staff, wide range of rooms","I had booked two nights in what they called Double room de luxe. But the room they gave me was very small, high up under the roof and, worst of all, without window. 
When I complained they suggested a change to am room in the basement or in another building across the street. According to me the alternatives wore even worse, so I stayed in the windowless room. It was also late, around midnight.
But at least they tried, and promised me a more normal room the next night.
Which I got! That room was super, in a more modern part of the hotel. Large and fresh, with garden view and all that one could need.
They apologized a lot, which made me feel better. But the lesson is: this hotel has a great variety of rooms. Seems a bit hazardous if you don't know what you get.
Breakfast, not included, was OK for british standards.",3,2017,03,01
103,Service is above and beyond!,"Stayed on Pancake Day, arrived late and didn't want to go out for food. It wasn't on the menu, but the chef offered to source the ingredients and make pancakes especially for me! 
Lovely helpful staff and very comfortable bed. My only complaint was that they wouldn't take full payment in advancr over the phone. Would absolutely recommend, breakfast was wonderful too.",4,2017,03,01
103,Great place ,Fantastic hotel and very helpful and cheerful staff. Excellent location. Very reasonable price. Rooms have all that you require although maybe bit tight in some corners. Definitely a place to return to if staying in London ,5,2017,02,28
103,Highly recommend,"This hotel has everything you need. Pleasant staff, comfortable beds, competitive prices and a lovely breakfast. Close to Paddington station so we could get around easily.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2017,02,27
103,Highly recommended,Stayed here with my daughter for a night. I cannot fault the service. Staff were so welcoming and helpful. The room was very comfortable and quiet and we enjoyed the superb free breakfast. The location was ideal for us being a short walk from Paddington station. I have been recommending this hotel to family and friends and will definitely stay again next time I visit London.,5,2017,02,27
103,Can't wait to go back,"The minute I entered the hotel room I fell in love. What a great exterior and a welcoming surprise with fruits and wine. The location of the hotel is excellent, just 5 minutes (depends on your speed) walk to paddington station. The hotel staff are super nice and helpful. I really enjoyed my stay. Thank you!",5,2017,02,27
103,Great Service. Lovely Hotel,Located in a very beautifully area. There are some shops in the area .Not very far away from Hyde park and not more than 15 mins walking from Marble Arch and Oxford Street. Service of the receptionist and porters was peak especially that of the porters. Very Helpful. The rooms are all modern and have lovely finishes. Very very clean though slightly small. Beds are very comfy too. A good choice for breakfast though not included in the price.,5,2017,02,25
103,Excellent value close to Hyde Park,Located in the heart of Paddington close to the train/tube station and Hyde Park which makes many of the sights within walking distance. Very friendly and helpful staff. Double rooms are compact but very comfortable with all of the necessary requirements. Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice.,5,2017,02,23
103,London gem! ,"Our 'compact double room' was exactly what it said on the tin. Perfect. The room was clean, had everything we could possibly need (even a mobile phone to use during our stay), the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was great with complimentary products. 

The local of this hotel couldn't be better, Paddington Station and underground is up the road, and Hyde Park is one street away. 
We didn't have breakfast included in our stay but found a lovely little cafe 'Shelia's cafe' on our walk to Hyde Park - which I would recommend. 

Overall and excellent stay, polite stay and we would return. ",5,2017,02,22
103,Absolutely Great Service,"It broke my heart that I had to take a star away because of the loudness of the doors closing, because I just absolutely love the staff at this hotel, everyone from the doormen to the porters to front desk to housekeeping--they really strive for excellence in service here. 

The room doors have a hinge that allow them to close slowly, but with a loud bang.  Especially if you're a sleeper at odd hours like me, you're really at the mercy of your fellow guests, whether they're the ""let the door slam"" type or not.  I woke up several times during my sleep every night because of this.  

However, 10 minutes upon checking into my room, they phoned me from the front desk asking me how i like the room. I casually mentioned it's kind of small but to be expected.  They immediately switched me to another room, which equated an upgrade.  They sent multiple poeple to help me move my stuff to the new room too.  

One can tell, they really take pride in the level of service they provide.  I'm kind of sad to leave and want to give them more money.",4,2017,02,22
103,"Very nice, will go back.","Lovely people and lovely place to stay. Breakfast was really good, staff very friendly. Room was very small but nice and clean. It is a recently renovated hotel internally and older on the outside so had a very nice atmosphere.",4,2017,02,22
103,Great stay,We were staying here for 2 nights due to problem in their sister hotel. Transfer went very smoothly. Staff welcominng and friendly. Hotel is like a maze so you better memorise your way back out or to the room. Breakfast quick and tasty. Well done to all the staff and managers. And thank you for all. ,5,2017,02,22
103,Tremendous value for money and the most wonderful staff,"We stayed here after seeing the value deal on booking .com
Although the room was small - it was immaculate and had all the amenities we expected and needed. The location was great - an easy stroll to Paddington, tubes, and Hyde Park.
The staff were so welcoming and we were amazed when the phone rang 10 minutes after check in, and the duty manager was checking we were happy with our room.
I Have travelled to many hotels in 30 years of business travel - and this has never happened before.
In short this was incredible value for money ( £84) and we were highly satisfied with the hotel, the amenities and the service we received
Well done to everyone at the hotel",4,2017,02,20
103,Clear hotel close to station,"Great hotel.  Very clean and up to date.  Walking distance to paddington.  Small rooms,  but that is to be expected in Europe.  Breakfast was good and the staff was excellent .  Second time I have stayed there.",4,2017,02,20
103,Valentine's holiday at the Park Grand Paddington,"We stayed here for a couple of nights from Valentine's Day and received a wonderful welcome from all staff. There was an amazing display on the bed, table and shower celebrating the day! Many thanks to everyone for making us so welcome and comfortable.",5,2017,02,18
103,"Friendly staff, clean room","Great little hotel 5-10 mins walk from Paddington station.  We stayed here for 1 night whilst visiting London.  The staff were really friendly and helpful, especially Zdravko who showed us our room and everything associated with it.  The rooms were clean and well laid out with all the facilities you would expect.  The only negative for us was that the corridor outside the room was a little noisy in the early hours with guests returning (but theres not much the hotel can do about that!).
Will definitely return 😀",4,2017,02,17
103,Great stay,The whole staff is very nice and helpful. Room size was perfect (maybe a bigger desk where to work will be much appreciated). Breakfast is excellent. Fast checkout. Very close to Paddington train station and tube stations,5,2017,02,16
103,Yet again amazing stay,"This hotel gets better every time I stay. 

Service exemplary and rooms are pleasant, inviting and comfortable 

I wouldn't stay anywhere else now in central. 

Keep doing what your doing guys cause it's working

Love the little touches - choc on pillows, toiletries etc 

Amazing ",5,2017,02,15
103,Fantastic experience!,"This hotel is very well located, close to the tube, close to Hyde Park and surrounded by amazing restaurants and even a few grocery stores and other stores.
The staff was the most helpful and friendly I have ever seen and the place was super clean and inviting.
Our room was very small but practical. It was great to have a mini fridge with a kettle and cups, glasses and other stuff for the morning. The bed was comfortable.",5,2017,02,15
103,Small Rooms,"It is located very near to Paddington Station and walking distance to Hyde Park. Onlu negative issue about hotel, standart rooms are very small , due to this whoever talk or pass in feomt of your room you hear them. Clean, not so expensive, they are offering free wi-fi and mobile device including map, lıcal calls and free skype with some selected countries. Breakfast ok. ",4,2017,02,14
103,A good choice ,"We stayed here for a weekend in London and were happy with our choice. Good location near Paddington station so good for the Heathrow Express. Not TOO close to the station though so the area is quite nice. 

Reception was friendly and the room although very small was perfectly clean and comfortable, which for this price range in London is pretty good. 

Overall we were happy with the hotel and would stay again. ",4,2017,02,14
103,Xmas Stay,"Gave this hotel a second chance again as we stayed Xmas 2015. Paid extra for a ""so called"" suite. The room was smaller than an average Premier Inn room and had very little space in the Bathroom.
Tried the restaurant on one occasion only and left the meal which was very poor quality.
Asked for a gin and tonic at the bar and eventually got a drink after the bar tender had to fetch a manager as he could not speak English ??????
Will definitely not stay in this hotel again.",3,2017,02,13
103,Very good London hotel ,The room size is small as expected for London. However the staff were very welcoming and we got an upgrade on arrival. Our room was very clean and had everything you would want. Good location and we would definitely stay again! ,5,2017,02,13
103,Great for a short stay!,"Overall lovely hotel. Very clean, service was good and wifi connection was always full. 

Few downers....
My partner & I booked the compact double room as the price is very appealing although the room is a lot smaller than the pictures show.
Room was always cold... either could of been draft from the window or the heating.

Location is also handy with some great cafes nearby for breakfast.

Hotel is about a 5 minute walk from Paddington Underground.",4,2017,02,13
103,Cozy and elegant - home away from home,"I absolutely love this Hotel. The staff make you feel at home from the moment you step in. We we upgraded to the Club room. The room was elegant with great attention to the detail. It was very clean and we had some complementary fruit upon arrival. The bathroom floor was heated and the room also had a microwave apart from the mini-fridge and kettle. I also appreciate the fact that there was a proper hair dryer inside the wardrobe! The breakfast was decent and well worth it compared with the prices of having breakfast outside. The location is perfect. The Hotel is located 5 min from the Paddington Station - Heathrow Express (15min from Heathrow Airport), Tube and Train. We have already decided to book another stay to celebrate our anniversary on the same Hotel. We are looking forward to stay there again.",5,2017,02,06
103,Superb  Stay,"It was great pleasure to stay in this hotel. The front line staff Mr Alex and Ms Alice really made they job extremely well. Through out my stay, every staff was very pleasant and carrying. Walking distance to Tube and Banks. My next visit to London, no doubt the choice is this Hotel again.",4,2017,02,06
103,Excellent Stay,"Booked this hotel for a 3 night visit to London for my wife birthday. We were NOT disappointed!!! On arrival we were greeted with a room upgrade which was very good of them. The room, although a tad on the small side was very well furnished and very clean.
Breakfast was good and all the staff superb. Thank You",5,2017,02,04
103,Perfect hotel for a perfect weekend ,"I recently took my wife to London for the weekend as a surprise for her 30th birthday. We were going to watch the lion king in the west end on the Friday,and out for dinner and cocktails on the Saturday.After looking a lot,and I mean a lot, I found this hotel in Paddington. The price was slightly cheaper than others too.

It's safe to say I will 100% be staying here when I'm next in London! The hotel staff were amazing...as it was my wife's 30th I had called ahead to let them know.

Once we arrived we were checked in instantly,and had our bags Carried to our room. We had a lovely surprise,they had left a birthday cake,rose petals on the bed and made a birthday cake made of towels .The room was a good size and immaculate..the and the bed was huge and comfy.we had a ground floor room but was. No noise at all.

The hotel it literally a 5min walk from Paddington station and as this is on the bakerloo line you can easy access oxford street,Leicester sq,embankment without switching lines. 

It is 5 min walk to Hyde park and we walked to oxford street,it took around 20 min but is basically one straight road.

After shopping on the Saturday we returned to our room to gone a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket with a lovely birthday message for my wife.

We had breakfast included and I would highly recommend,it was self service and had all you can eat bacon,sausage,egg,toms,mushrooms herb potato etc..fresh coffee was bought to our table and the tables were cleared instantly.

So if you want a lovely hotel in London,I would recommend this Hotel,they go the extra mile,and are on hand for everything. It made our weekend perfect and I would like to thank everyone at the hotel",5,2017,02,03
103,A real gem in Paddington!!,"Was upgraded to Club room.Enjoyed the complimentary wine,fruit bowl and mobile phone.Modern bathroom and comfy bed made for a relaxed night after a long haul flight.The reception staff were all from overseas with good level of English.Without exception all were very friendly and most helpful.Then only a 5 minute walk to Paddington for the train home.",5,2017,02,03
103,It's ok,"Stayed here to see daughter, also some sightseeing, good flat walk to hotel from Paddington showed us to our room, staff very friendly and welcoming, on arrival to the room, it was cosy not a great deal of walking space, looked out of the window no view but 6 air conditioning fans directly below, old fashion sash window, so had a very disturbed sleep (room 318), mentioned it at reception and a substitute room was offered, had a look all ok, they moved us while we were out nice, next morning no hot water, boiler issues very apologetic but going around London without a shower is not really a good thing, very surprised no back up system for this issue, no compensation offered, just apologies, breakfast was self service buffet style in the basement, no windows no view, very busy, only scrambled eggs on offer, coffee came in 2 cup cafetière so had to request more immediately, it wasn't my best stay in London but it wasn't my worse stay either, 
",3,2017,02,02
103,what you see is not what you buy ...,"Almost everything was okay, the people at the Reception very kind and cooperative, the location very good, BUT the room was the smallest I have never seen, as well as the bathroom, in spite of showing the pictures proposed on the web larger rooms.  
Can't stay there more than a couple of days. Furthermore, there was no way to regulate the temperature: too hot the first night, too cold the second.",3,2017,02,01
103,My regular bed in west London,"For the last year I have stayed here 8 times. I fly in from Canada, Heathrow Express to Paddington and a 5 minute walk to the hotel. They often will check you in early if they are able. The next day walk to Paddington station and train out. 
A note of caution for all North Americans all London Hotels in this price range have small bedrooms and some a lot better than others. This hotel has an elevator, recently modernized , very clean rooms and Extremely comfortable beds.Would recommend upgrade to club rooms, free use of mobile phone and data,welcoming half bottle of wine and fruit, and slightly bigger rooms. The front desk has wonderfully friendly young men and women who go out of their way to please. Breakfast buffet if good, complimentary news papers and well run operation. They have a nice bar which I do not use as they do not stock real ale or microbrews.
Location , location, location. Really close to two great pubs ,the Victoria and the Mitre.
Close to a passable Indian Restaurant, Malaysian,Chinese Italian, etc and lots of convenience stores.
For the tourist close to rail,bus and tube and a morning walk in Hyde Park
I look forward to staying here😎🇬🇧🇨🇦🍺",4,2017,01,31
103,Lovely weekend stay,"Had a lovely weekend stay at the Paddington Court, felt really well looked after from the moment we arrived until the time we left. Friendly staff nothing was to much trouble the club room was comfortable and extremely good value with a good breakfast included. 
Some nice touches especially the chocolates in the evening.
Will definitely be our first choice when we return to London",5,2017,01,31
103,Without a doubt...a perfect stay,"It comes to question a great majority of hotels based in Paddington may excel in service and amenities, I understand that, however, for me, this hotel went above and beyond. 
 For myself and my partner, this was our first trip to the bosom of England's capital city. It could have been a disaster from the onset, travelling as a pair merely broken out of our teenage years, but anticipation and excitement still coursed through us, regardless of how big of a city it was. I must say, it couldn't have gone smoother traversing through London thanks to the staff at the hotel. I'm not sure if it is a mandate for a mobile to be accessible for all residents to carry around for your stay, but gosh, it was so handy. 

 Everything was clean and organised. The staff were attentive and helpful. Honestly, the whole two-day experience was perfect. The location: it couldn't have been better. 

P.s, For a hotel, the bed was out-of-this-world. I slept like a baby.",5,2017,01,31
103,For London it was fine,It's is nothing fantastic but for just over 120 pounds for a room in the middle of London it's all good.  It was clean and comfortable and I would stay here again.  It's is very near Paddington station and the room was small but adequate.  There was no were to sit and if this was out of a major city I would give it three stars.  But in city's like London there is always a premium and I felt it was worth what I paid given the location.  It's but budget but not luxury.  However if you want comfort on a budget this is the place.,4,2017,01,30
103,A very good weekend,"I' liked very much:
The confortable bed,
The excellent and big bath towels,
The decoration,
The friendly staff,
The Paddigton  metro station nearby,
Close to Hyde Park.
The room and bathroom were small,but it was well to me.The reception called to know if I was pleased whith the room and the wallet who carried my bag was very polite and helpful",5,2017,01,30
103,Good services,"The hotel was renovated about a year ago, so it's pretty nice and clean. It's very close to the underground and Paddington station.

The staff is great. They made me a surprise in my room, as it was my birthday one of those days.
The single rooms are very small, but cozy and the bed is comfortable.
The breakfast is the same every day, but it's good.

I stayed here for a week and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who travels for pleasure or for business purpose.",4,2017,01,30
103,Very good hotel,"I can recommend this hotel, I stayed here one night and it's a short 5 minute walk from the tube, I arrived late at night and it felt very safe. The room has every amenity one might need, including usb, handy, and european socket, no converter needed! Breakfast was OK. Finding the room was a bit challenging, living on the bottom floor, it was a labyrinth of corridors and stairs. ",5,2017,01,29
103,Superb,"We enjoyed our stay at Park Grand Paddington Court. The staff was very helpful, specially Alex who offered us a complementary room upgrade because the bed was too small for us. The hotel was very nice and convenient. We highly recommend it and we will consider it again next time we visit London .... Joanna from Beirut , Lebanon.",5,2017,01,29
103,Great service!,"Very pleasant hotel with perfect location and great service! Quiet and clean. Would specially like to mention Zdravko, who was really nice and helpful! Perfect place to go to for a short business trip.",5,2017,01,29
103,Exceptional,"This hotel is definitely after going on my top 3 hotels in London. Location is superb, tube station 2 minutes away. Oxford street was a 20 minute walk away. The staff are very friendly, the household staff are fantastic and offer a super service.The rooms are spotless, they smell great and have the most comfortable beds. There was a microwave, fridge, tea/coffee making facilities. The room had a mobile phone called ""Handy"", this was for us to use throughout our stay providing us with full 4G internet outside the hotel, free international calls and was full of information about things to see and do in London. I have never seen this service at all in any hotel I have ever stayed in. This tells me they really take into consideration what would make your stay more pleasant and really are thinking of their customers. Will definitely stay here again and recommend it to family and friends.",5,2017,01,27
103,"A great value hotel in a lovely, central location","I was very impressed with the Park Grand hotel for many reasons: The hotel is clean, stylish & modern with all necessary amenities (of a high quality), the staff are friendly & helpful, the breakfast is very good & the price, especially considering the excellent, central but quiet & attractive location, is extremely reasonable. I was in London on business & stayed for two nights - this hotel more than satisfied my requirements & I would definitely recommend it.",5,2017,01,27
103,No Catches,"This was a big surprise and really exceeded all my expectations. The hotel is very well priced and my room was large, quiet, clean, modern  and very comfortable. Its a 10 minute walk to Paddington Station, it has a good variety of restaurants and bars nearby. The staff were all very helpful and cheery and the breakfast had all you need. For a business trip to London, i think this will be hard to beat.",5,2017,01,26
103,stunning!,"So impressed with this hotel. Finally met an establishment that was even more OCD than me! Everything was well thought out and the attention to detail was amazing. 
For the price, which was very reasonable, we had above standard accommodations compared to other hotels we booked on our trip. Would highly recommended it in terms of location, comfort and great staff. Corina at the front desk was really sweet as well as every staff member we dealt with!",5,2017,01,26
103,"EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICES, FRIENDLY & PROFESSIONAL STAFF","We have been using the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel regularly for business meetings since last year and we are more than delighted at the service given every time and the most friendly as well as professional members of staff.

A special thanks to Zdravko whose coffee we get to look forward to in the early hours of the morning for our marathon meetings. 

Compliments to management for your amazing team!!! Keep up the great service.",5,2017,01,25
103,Great Service,"I work in a hotel and this one met all my standards, me and my partner were always asked is everything was okay, served on hand and foot, the room was cosy and well presented, especially with the heated bathroom floor! Would defiantly stay here again, It was something we weren't expecting & it was very much appreciated! We noticed on another day it was a guests birthday.",5,2017,01,25
103,Great place,we enjoyed our stay at the Park Grand with a sensational comfy bed and amenities that were exquisite. The breakfast was the sole let down with a distinct lack of hash browns despite promise from the staff. ,4,2017,01,25
103,"Great location, service, rooms and breakfast !","This hotel is not high-end, but still very nice and provide good value for money.

Rooms have OK size and are relatively newly refurbished and are equipped with a large TV set, a smart phone, US, SUIKO and USB power sockets. Beds are nice, although the pillow was on the too solid side for me. Good size cupboard. Coffee & coffee maker + biscuits are provided.

Breakfast is great, with good selection cereals, fruit, bread,  pastries etc. And you can have your full English breakfast too, for those so inclined !

And staff are all friendly. We arrived for breakfast 7:00 on a Saturday morning, forgetting that the service only started at 7:30. But that was no big deal, we were helped out in the best possible way.

We would go back any time !

Tip: If you order a room directly with the hotel, breakfast is included, at least at the time of writing.",5,2017,01,24
103,Paddington! ,"This hotel was absolutely lovely! Great location - close to Paddington station, easy to find even at night! The staff couldn't help you enough & everything asked for was easily given . When they realised it was our honeymoon we received a beautiful card saying thankyou for choosing the park grand, red roses on the bed & a towel decorated as two swans. It was something we weren't expecting & it was very much appreciated! 
We noticed on another day it was a guests birthday, so the staff knocked on his door with a surprise for him too (I think it was a cake from memory) 
Not every hotel would do this or even care about these events so it made us feel very special. 
Breakfast was awesome although the room is small & we did feel cramped however there is not much that can be done about that. On the first nights of our stay I had booked a compact double room not realising that this meant a small small bed. If you like your space don't go for this option! The next room we had was much better & plenty of space! ",5,2017,01,23
103,Couldn't have been better,"Went for a Christmas treat with my partner and I have to say, I work in a hotel and this one met all my standards, me and my partner were always asked is everything was okay, served on hand and foot, the room was cosy and well presented, especially with the heated bathroom floor! Would defiantly stay here again, it really mad our stay! All the staff really just wanted to serve! Thankyou!!!",5,2017,01,23
103,Nice touch!,"I felt I should write a review due to the service received when we stayed in London for my birthday weekend.
From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome, staff were informative, friendly and genuinely seemed interested in your plans for your stay. During a conversation had at checkin we mentioned how we were in London for my birthday but had not thought anything from it.
The following day after visiting some sights we returned to our room to find balloons, a card and even a yummy piece of chocolate cake!! I was made up and thought this was such a nice and thoughtful touch!
Alex & cotima thank you again, you have a great team and we would definitely return",4,2017,01,23
103,London weekend break,"Perfect hotel for our London weekend, Very close to underground,. Room clean, although small we never plan to spend much time in the room The bed  a little soft, wonderful breakfast. All staff polite and very helpful",4,2017,01,23
103,Lovely hotel in a great location,"From the moment we arrived our experience at this hotel was excellent. The welcome from the front of house staff was great and we felt comfortable and appreciated. Every member of staff we met was extremely pleasant, nothing was too much trouble. The room was very comfortable, we were upgraded to a club room and I was even left a card, some balloons and a piece of chocolate cake because it was my birthday! Our room was on the basement level which was extremely quiet, you would not believe you were in the middle of London as there was no traffic noise at all.
The breakfast was good with plenty of choice.
We would definitely go back to this hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to other travelers.",5,2017,01,23
103,Very nice!,"Stayed here for a night before heading back to the states. It was the nicest place we stayed while we were in Europe. I should mention that we booked budget hotels and got a good deal for this one night. It's a great location if you're comfortable taking the tube or walking. Kensington Palace is right there as is the Paddington station. You can pick up the Heathrow Express from Paddington Station-15 min to Heathrow or about 45 using the Piccadilly line. Bakerloo line takes you to Piccadilly within 8 stops. 

Breakfast was included in our reservation and it was the best hotel breakfast we had during our 2 weeks staying in hotels. Typical- eggs, bacon, sausage, breads/cheese/deli meats. Fruit bar!  Juices and coffee. 

The twin beds were super comfortable and the room we got was on ground level with street view. AWESOME! blackout curtains and mostly sound proof rooms. Rain shower head as well as hand shower faucet. To get to our room, we had to walk thru multiple fire doors, which made for quiet halls/rooms. It's a small location, but very nice and welcoming.  Would stay here again.",4,2017,01,19
103,New Years trip! ,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Park Grand Paddington over New Year's Eve
2016/17. We arrived on the 31 and stayed until the 4. I had a wonderful
experience and would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family
members while visiting London. I had a few special requests and the hotel
manager kindly took care of all my problems. The staff at the front desk, in
the bar, bellboys, and at breakfast were all fantastic. Very personal and
had an eye out for details which made me feel well taken care of. My room
(111) was a wonderful size, had a great view, not complicated to reach, and
I slept great in my bed. I would request a similar room in the future when I
come back to London, and with out a doubt stay at this hotel a second time! ",5,2017,01,19
103,Excellent hotel in excellent location,"Lovely room, very comfortable bed, super clean.  Excellent staff - very friendly and helpful.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Good breakfast choice.   Upgraded on arrival as I'm a regular visitor and was made to feel special.  Nice touch.  Thank you!",5,2017,01,18
103,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is well located for both Paddington station and the underground. The staff are welcoming and friendly, and there did seem rather a lot of them! The room was very good, but I didn't give this 5 stars, as the sleeping area was rather cramped. The heating system took a little while to work out, and it was only when the bathroom floor was too hot to walk on, that we realised we needed to adjust something!  There are microwaves and fridges in the rooms, which is a nice touch. The breakfast was very good, with plenty of choices. If I stay in London again, I will definitely choose this hotel. As so many reviews have said, the staff really do help make this hotel what it is",4,2017,01,17
103,Brilliant stay at this hotel,"Can't praise the staff enough especially Sara the manager who made this stay very memorable by organising afternoon tea in one of the sister hotels. 
The staff were welcoming, professional and couldn't do enough to make you feel welcome and relaxed, nothing was too much trouble. 
The room was clean, tidy and spacious which was a real surprise for a London hotel, both myself and my children loved the chocolates on the pillow each night and the little card that wish a good night sleep, which we all had.
The breakfast staff were also really helpful as my daughter had a bad cold and they brought her flavoured tea with honey and lemon just to ease her throat along with their well wishes for her speedy recovery.
Have stayed in London several times but this is by far the best experience I have had and just wish to say thank you to all the staff for making our stay in their hotel really wonderful.",5,2017,01,17
103,Amazing hotel amazing price,"My stay at the hotel was amazing.
I did not expect such a good hotel in this price
Very friendly staff
Strongly recommended
Definitely my next trip to London in march I'll stay with them again
Love it......",5,2017,01,17
103,Perfect!!,"Amazing!
It was a great pleasure to stay in this hotel !!! Everything was perfect from the staff to the position near the underground! 
It was clean, confortable and everything was made to make us condortable!
If you want to stay in London for a while, go ahead !!!",5,2017,01,16
103,"Friendly, clean, and very helpful staff ","We had 3 nights at this lovely hotel. What a great choice! After checking many options we decided to tried the Park Grand Paddington Court. First we had a very nice room but a bit smaller. The room was the club and very comfortable bed and welcome amenities. 
After one night we just asked for a little bigger room if possible and what a big surprise for us, Alex from the Front Desk and his lovely team very quickly make all the chances for us. We got a bigger room, same very comfortable. The maid service, concierge and the front desk team was AMAZING! And we want to thanks for the great time we had.
Also the hotel is close to all the bus stops, subways and easy to go everywhere from here. 
For sure, we will return! 100% recommended. 
Thank you Alex and management :)

103,"Beautifully furnished, well located, nicely priced","Excellent breakfast buffet, fast and easy wifi: my two favorite amenities top my list of recommendations for this hotel. Friendly staff, quiet, good beds although my single bed was quite narrow. The room is small but not claustrophobic and it's well designed to make good use of its limited space. Beautiful flatscreen TV with many channels in true HD. Full service bar serves a complete menu for lunch and dinner.  Electric outlets for US/Japan/China flat type plugs as well as UK style, also a USB outlet for charging  your electronics.  A ""Handy"" cellphone in your room you can take with you to make and receive local and international calls and browse the mobile internet, free! Modern, clean bathroom. Fridge, room safe, and coffeemaker. Good location, 3 blocks from Paddington Station which is a short bus or subway ride from many attractions and one of the best city stations to connect to Heathrow airport. All this at a very competitive room rate. You can find hotels at a lower price, but chances are they won't be this nicely furnished and the bathroom will be down the hall.",5,2017,01,14
103,Pleasantly surprised,"Originally booked into the Grand Royale Hyde Park, upon arriving we were told there was a ""boiler issue"" which meant we had to be re-located to a sister hotel. After sitting down, reading reviews of others who had been given the boiler excuse, we were expecting the worst, but we didn't really have an option.

Luckily, we were moved to the Park Grand Paddington Court. The room was fantastic, there was very little noise from the road and we were a stones throw away from Paddington station.

The thing that stood out most was the service from all staff, all were very polite and willing to help. Zdravko was especially helpful from the moment we were greeted to the moment we left.

Really cannot fault the hotel, in hindsight I would have booked this hotel to start with.  ",5,2017,01,11
103,Not what we were expecting but would defiantly revisit ,"Myself and my partner stayed at the Park Grand Paddington Court between 4th and 8th January. 
When we arrived and we're shown to our room it was not what we expected for the ""deluxe double"" room that we had booked and viewed in pictures online. It was a strange little set up, firstly we were in room 556 which is not part of he actual hotel it is across the road in another building which wasn't a problem just like I said just not what we were expecting. Our room was small and compact but had everything we needed and more including our own ""kitchen"" area which contained a household size fridge, microwave, cups, glasses, plates, bowls and cutlery. Almost like a self contained apartment. It was clean and comfortable which suited us down to the ground. 
A little hiccup... Lancaster Gate tube station closed on our arrival date until July but we managed to get around just fine using busses and the Bakerloo line which runs from Paddington station straight to Oxford Circus so no problem there! Breakfast was not included in the price of our room so we decided to pay the £11.95 each for this, on our first morning we went down for breakfast and were seated and served our tea/coffee and had even started tucking into our breakfast when the lady on the desk came over and rather abruptly said that breakfast was not included and that she would have to charge £14.95 each to our room. I calmly informed her we had already prebooked and paid for breakfast for our entire stay. We were then asked if we had proof of this in the form of a receipt (which we did) before going away to check with reception. 
The lady returned a couple of minuets later to advise her colleagues on reception had missed it off the paperwork. No apology for the misunderstanding! A little embarrassing for us as she wasn't very subtle about the way she approached us. Luckily we didn't experience any further problems. 
All in all a good stay and would defiantly return. 
",5,2017,01,11
103,Good city hotel,"The location was convenient to Paddington Station, but not that close to site seeing destinations.  It was very clean & the staff was very nice.  Typical city hotel in that the rooms are very small.  I will say that it was very quiet.  Only complaint is that the WiFi was sort of iffy.",4,2017,01,10
103,Wonderful!,"I stayed for 4 nights at the Park Grand, on an unplanned stop over in London to visit some friends whilst in Europe. The reception staff were very friendly as was the guy that helped bring my luggage to my room! The rooms are clean and comfortable and the hotel is in a nice spot close enough to Paddington Station. I will be returning to London soon and will have my mother with me, will definitely be looking at staying here again! ",5,2017,01,09
103,Great Stay,"This a great location, room small but very comfortable.  Beds very confortable, and I have back problems and it was a good sleep. The full breakfast was great.  Staff very helpful. Its 5 minutes to Paddington Tube and Station, very handy for Healthrow express. I would stay there again.",4,2017,01,08
103,Amazing ,We stayed at this hotel 27th-29th of December and it was absolutely incredible. From the moment we walked in the staff were friendly and attentive. The rooms were nice and clean. We had breakfast on our second morning of our stay and it was great. The choices were amazing and everything was lovely. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in London. ,5,2017,01,08
103,Lovely!!,"After firstly going to the Park Grand Kensington and then the Park Grand Paddington before finally finding the right one!! (Our fault) Lovely staff and nice decor. Little issue with the check in as it was booked as a gift for us. Staff dealt with it brilliantly and upgraded us to the club room which is very nice!! 
Thank you Park Grand!! Will definitely stay again.

103,My first time on London,"On Easter holiday 2016, we went to london for 5 days, me, my husband and my two kids . I was informed that the room space is small so I reserve in advance two rooms. Room is clean and new furniture. Staff are friendly. Location around 5 to 6 minute from padington station. Also it was near to Hyde park by foot around 10 to 15 minute. There was a bike rent facility near the hotel. However there is no free car park. Also in order to access  for the first floor you have to climb several steps then turn right then left to find the lift.",3,2017,01,04
103,"Brilliant hotel, great location.","I booked to stay here for my partners birthday for a couple of nights, the hotel is very nice from the outside and the location is brilliant, close to the station and great for getting around London. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, and a nice touch one of the receptionists, Sarah gave us a bottle of wine as birthday compliments which we thought very thoughtful. Would certainly go back. ",4,2017,01,04
103,Wonderful,"This is the best Hotel i've ever tried in London, Great Location and services, for me the first hotel ever that gave me a free cellphone with unlimited internet during my journey, very useful for visiting the city.
My room was the cheapest, it was a bit small but perfectly clean and with all the comforts.",5,2017,01,04

103,Remarkable hotel and centrally located,"Room and bathroom were very clean, bathroom amenities replenished daily.  Breakfast was a daily full English breakfast in an immaculately clean breakfast room on a lower level; staff were courteous and attentive.  Property is walking distance from Paddington Station and only a couple of blocks from the Underground.  Local bus stop is several blocks away and bus runs 24 hours a day.  Church is a short walk.  Several restaurants in the area, including fast food types, and convenience stores are around the block.",4,2017,01,02
103,Lovely hotel,"It was a modern hotel and in an area that was residential and  had nice restaurants and close to Paddington station as well as Hyde Park. Though the room was small, it had all the amenities of a superior hotel. The breakfast buffet was hot and delicious. We  usually walked through the park to reach our destinations and was a nice respite from the city traffic. Enjoyed the area and the hotel.",4,2017,01,02
103,Great location,A great location  close to Paddington Station and Kensington Gardens for our two night stay. We had a small but very quiet room with a microwave which was handy. Great breakfast free of charge. Very friendly staff helped to make our stay enjoyable.,4,2017,01,01
103,An Absolute Hidden Gem,"This was our second stay at Park Grand Paddington Court and it certainly won't be our last.
From the offset this hotel makes you feel a million dollars.
All the staff from Management to reception to luggage / doormen to room cleaners put in 110% to make your stay that much more enjoyable.
All food served on the premises is to a high standard, I can  especially recommend  the buffet breakfast.
The cosy bar and there staff is also a nice clean well presented area and well priced
When it comes to rooms theirs something to suit everybody's price range they are all very well equipped and also come with the free use of a mobile phone for the duration of your stay that you can actually take in and around London with you.
As far as I know the majority of the rooms have been recently refurbished the beds are very comfortable and the shower / Bathrooms are very well thought out.
As for location you have the choice of using the Paddington tube service around 10 to 15 minutes away or the Lancaster gate tube service about 5 to 10 minutes away.
Also Hyde Park Corner is right opposite Lancaster Gate Underground which is an added bonus.
To finish, on our second stay we were greeted at Reception by Sara (Guest Relations)
she then gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and told us that we had been upgraded to a larger room free of charge, this was such an unexpected gesture of goodwill and made our stay even more enjoyable.
Our stay was from Christmas eve until late Boxing day and from the time we booked our stay (early November) Sara had kept in touch with us keeping us informed of all the festivities food menus etc... that would be taking place during our stay.
We cannot thank everyone enough for the service we received during our stay, But we can assure you we will be back very soon.
Thank you Park Grand Paddington Court for Everything .
           Kind Regards From Mr & Mrs McCarty.",5,2017,01,01

breakfast is very good.
 The best feature: they give you a mobile phone with internet and free local calls and text, and a few internationals as well. you can use trip advisor and google maps (and other sites) free of charge! 
The basic rooms are ok for 2 nights with little luggage. we came for a week, so the upgrade made it a good experience. great value for money and location is wonderful, walked almost anywhere. ",5,2016,12,31
103,Great location,"The location was great. However, it was really cold in my room and the heater did not work. I called many times to the reception if they could fix for me, unfortunately nobody came and the receptionist said that I have to turn the heater on by myself. However, it did not work and I called the reception again. Nobody came to check the heater in my room. I was disappointed about the service of the staff.  In conclusion, great bedrooms, clean and perfect location.",3,2016,12,30
103,The outstanding night shift team,I don't know how to begin but the night shift team in the hotel offered me all what I wanted and they are very friendly and nice and espicialy Roney and Dario and Richard they desirve more appriciation from the guests and and they are always ready to help the guests.,5,2016,12,29

103,Theatre Break in London ,"We booked  this  as it was close to Hyde Park  and not far from the West end, and Shops .Oxford Street is 3 stops on the  Central  Line  from Lancaster gate which is on the Bayswater Road 
We  checked in at Devonshire Place and were  taken around the corner to an annex The Receptionist  was very friendly  and informative. We were shown to our room which was downstairs from ground level .Yes the room was small ,but adequate for  our needs we were not going to live in the room for our stay
The en-suite shower room  /Wc had toiletries supplied  .The room it's self had a flat screen TV  /safe /hairdryer/iron and ironing board/tea making facilities/personal smartphone and ample storage space. 
Breakfast was included  in the room rate either Continental or Full English service was excellent  .
All in all  the staff were very helpful and friendly. Would definitely  recommend and stay there  again ",5,2016,12,28
103,Weekend break ,"The Paddington Grand Court is a nice hotel with excellent staff
We booked the Junior Suite and when we checked in all looked well until we were taken over the road into another building. Our room was in the basement and it didn't look at all what we booked. I asked for our room to be changed as we didn't want to be in a dingy basement. There was no fuss made at all and our room was changed extremely quickly. We were given a room in the main building which was a standard club room. The single beds were put together and a duvet was zipped up to make it fit. 
What a lovely room it was too. It was smaller than the ""suite"" but much more welcoming. Alex the manger was an absolute delight to deal with and he refunded us an amount for the inconvenience (or maybe it was the difference in the room price?) but either way a nice thing to do!
Breakfast is lovely, the sausages were yummy 
The staff really do make the place as we did not encounter one person who didn't seem like they didn't want to be there. 
We had a lovely stay and we will consider staying here again

103,"Great stay, great location, great staff","I had the pleasure of staying at the park grand on my first trip to England. It was also the first time I was travelling solo, so as a female solo traveller  I wanted to ensure I was in a safe and secure hotel/location. The hotel was clean and modern and the location was superb. It was mins away (walking) from Paddington station and to Hyde park. There were lots of restaurants and buses in the area as well. The receptionists were great and friendly. They helped me navigate the city and figure out where certain places were thanks to Tina, Mariya and Cynann who made my stay so great. ",5,2016,12,27
103,Feeling like at home ,"I have been here on Christmas day and it was a special experience. The structure of the hotel is great, luxurious and welcoming. The hotel is in the center of London but away from city noise, perfect for enjoying a little 'relaxation. Well connected by metro and public transport, good for tourist or business. The space bar and the restaurant space is medium in size, perfect for enjoying a drink or dinner in intimacy with the family, your partner or a friend, without the mess of a place very busy.  The food was good, the breakfast plentiful, I am Italian and I am sure not lies. The staff was helpful, wait for my late for meals are very grateful and I apologize. The room was very nice, I loved the decor and the wooden details and missing nothing, in addition to not worry if you come here without internet, because the hotel has a personal cell phone with internet great to move in London city or to contact someone everywhere. I would be to back again, LOVELY! ",5,2016,12,26
103,Superb all round stay 😃,"The Park Grand is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location. My son and I stayed there for three nights. We only wish it could have been longer. The hotel itself is a short walk from the main Paddington station. Our room was lovely, it was spotlessly clean and fresh fruit and clean towels/facilities were provided daily. However, the most important and outstanding thing about the hotel was the superbly friendly and helpful staff and management - that was simply the icing on the cake! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and, frankly, we can't wait to go back. I must highly recommend using this hotel. We had an absolutely superb all round stay. Thanks so much guys, for a fab time!!!!",5,2016,12,25
103,Not reccomendable,"A hotel not reccomendable. The staff at the hotel is well managed and  Frendly.  This does though not outway the poor State of the rooms. Never have I had so small rooms and bed. We modved twice though with no improovement. 

The rooms were though clean but extremly small, so small that we had to close the suitcases's for opening the door. The bed were app 140*190 impssible to lay in for two normal scandinavian people",2,2016,12,25
103,Very good,"Excellent service at reception desk and other staff too. Rooms are quite small but really comfortable and quite .

I have been really",5,2016,12,22
103,Lovely!!,"Stayed here from Sunday to Tuesday for a few days away with my other half. About 10 minutes walk from Paddington station it's in a lovely area. On arrival we were told we were staying in the basement which was ok with me as we weren't planning on being in the hotel much. The gentleman at the reception said we had been upgraded as we were in the basement, which was even better! Room was lovely and clean, we had the cosiest bathrobes which were a nice touch and with our upgraded room a bottle of wine too. All toiletries etc. were an added bonus and thank god there was a hair dryer because i'd forgotten mine. When we went out on the Monday and came back our room had been cleaned with fresh towels which was nice and we didn't expect it having only stayed 2 nights.  About 20minutes walk to Winter Wonderland which we went to on Monday so not too much of a walk and close to shops, cafe's etc if you don't want to travel far. Would definitely visit again :) ",4,2016,12,21
103,"Lovely hotel, exceptional service.","My partner and I stayed at the Park Grand for 4 nights.

The location was very nice and quite close to both Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate—making it easy to get around town and back again. The hotel itself is very newly refurbished, giving it a fresh feel.

The highlight of our stay at Park Grand was the hotel service we received from Roney and Maschio. Both assisted us on multiple occasions and made our time at Park Grand particularly special. 

We look forward to returning upon our next visit to London.",5,2016,12,20
103,Last minute booking,"This was the only hotel we could get for the weekend as london was obviously so busy the location wasnt great but not hard to get to by tube, hotel was lovely but check in took ages and they had my booking under the wrong name we did get put in a club room with loads of little extras which was nice but the bed was broken and the springs were coming through the matress which was a bit dissapointing but staff were apologetic when we made them aware.",3,2016,12,19
103,Brilliant hotel ,"Brilliant hotel, nice location. Paddington station is only at 10 mins walk, other nearest tube station is Ladbroke Grove. 

While the single rooms are very very tiny, the cleanliness and hygiene standards are very high.

Interestingly, they have complimentary mobile phone, from which one can dial anywhere in the world for free and unlimited. That's a very nice service.

103,Good base,My husband and I spent 4 nights at this hotel and we were very pleased! We knew going into this trip the room would be smaller and that was fine as we did not spend much time in our room other than to sleep etc. Having breakfast provided was also a nice touch as saved us some money and was a great way to start our day! Rooms have nice modern touches and everything one would need. ,5,2016,12,14

103,Nice quiet hotel ,"A lovely hotel in the heart of Paddington. The rooms are spacious for a London hotel and very modern. The beds are very comfortable and they use good linen ensuring a good nights sleep.
Breakfast is very good. It's a buffet but all the food is hot and of good quality.
The only minor thing was that the shower was a bit small but perfectly useable.",4,2016,12,10
103,An oasis in the desert,"London has many hotels but very few really good, dependable places.  For those only wanting to store their luggage during the day and sleep at night, many will do, I guess. But if you seek a comfortable place to stay and a good base from which to launch your journeys of London, the Park Grand Paddington Court in ideal. This hotel offers comfortable rooms with good quality sleeping quarters. (Not at all common in many other hotels in this neighborhood.). They are located a five minute walk from Paddington Station. In addition to giving access to four tube lines (the Circle, District, Bakerloo, and Hammersmith & City lines) at the underground station, the Paddington train station is the terminus for both the Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect. If you want access to the tube's Circle line just stroll from the hotel south for four minutes and get on at the Lancaster Gate Station adjacent to Hyde Park.  
   In addition to prime location for accessing all London has to offer, you are just five minutes from walking inside famous Hyde Park. The neighborhood is nice and populated with an assortment of places to eat, drink, or both.
    I came here in somewhat of an emergency after having stayed at another place in the neighborhood. My stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court allowed me to recuperate from a wrenched back. My lesson learned, I have resolved to make this my base for future trips to London. Even if you plan on a short stay in London, the proximity to Paddington train station gives you access to the rest of the U.K. via their rail system.  In the meantime, whether your stay is a brief stop over, or extended, this hotel provides a safe, comfortable, and dependable home in an area where hotels are plentiful, but good hotels are extremely few and far between.",5,2016,12,05
103,Great stau,Recently stayed at Park Grand Paddington court London and was totally satisfied.   Only minutes walk from Paddington underground or Heathrow express.  Convienent to everything.  Room was on the small side which is to be expected in London.  Very nicely decorated.  Bathroom had rainfall shower which felt great after long day of walking.  Opted for breakfast which had something for everyone with very attentive staff.  Check in and check was quick and effcient.  They do provide a cell phone which makes walking around much easier than using a map.  A big plus,4,2016,12,04
103,Perfect ,"Very nice hotel! Good service! 
Good rooms, perfect zone near the centre of the colture and fun of London.  I have to tell the friendly and nice welcome revived by the hotel staff in particular by the barman, Mirko, very friendly and nice, He explained us where to go having and where to go to fell like being home, I thank MIRKO and the hotel for making us having a good London experience.",5,2016,12,04
103,Enjoyed our stay...,"The hotel is clean and has an amazing breakfast. The hotel is roughly 7 minutes from Paddington Metro Station. I would highly recommend two restaraunt in the area. 

Flavors of India is on the corner 2 blocks from the hotel. It has great Indian food. The service is only average.

The Victoria is roughly a 12 minute walk but is not to be missed. The pub has fantastic food and atmosphere.",4,2016,12,03
103,Lovely hotel,Stayed here purposely to visit winter wonderland in Hyde park. Was great just a 15 min walk or short taxi ride away. Near to shops and underground. Hotel staff were friendly. Rooms were clean and had everything you needed. It was our anniversary so the hotel made a fuss putting cake and petals in room for us!,5,2016,12,03
103,"Superb staff, great location, clean room","My family recently spent a week at Park Grand Paddington Court. The hotel has a great location, 5-7 minute walk from the Paddington station and in a quiet neighborhood. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous. Alex, Rodney, Gleason, to name a few. They went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. The room was clean with modern bathroom. I'm pleasantly surprised that the hotel provided a smart phone, with which we can place calls, use Google Maps, search attractions, etc. I won't hesitate to stay there again.",5,2016,11,30
103,stayed 2days for xmas shopping,Very helpful had to change rooms because first room was next to the lift and could not sleep very well moved next day we went out and when we came back our suitcases had been moved to a club room would like to say big thank you to all the staff for their help will be staying again when we back in London and will recommend to family and friends not far to the shopping,5,2016,11,28
103,Nice room near the city,"The rooms was great and the bed was comfy and pillows really nice. Bathroom was ok as well as the shower. They give you a phone so you can use it for mapping out locations and calling people and places. It was a short walk to some parks. It is also near the train terminal and the London tube. You can jump on the tube and be downtown in just a quick ride. They have a bar and a place to eat, but I would go to all the great places near by.  The staff were really friendly and held our bags. There is also a business center to print stuff up.",4,2016,11,27
103,Retired US Govt ,"My 3rd stay in 2016 & my 8th overall. I think I've found my home in London. You can't beat the location for access to tubes, shops, restaurants, & entertainment. The reception & concierge staff to include Sara, Corina, Jana & Zdravko will make you feel welcomed and comfortable throughout your stay. The beds are sooo comfortable & I was impressed with the new smart ""Handy"" phones for guests personal use in each room. Free US calls. Exceptional value also. Looking forward to my next stay.",5,2016,11,24
103,"Great location, worth staying","Location is just perfect. In walking distance from Paddington railway station (20 minutes with a suitcase). Good breakfast (buffet), responsive staff. Rooms are small, but clean and tidy. Actually nothing to complain about. I decided to stay here despite the business was in Ealing.",5,2016,11,23
103,Clean hotel and helpful staff,"Helpful staff, great room - good size and nice bed, good location in Bayswater (near Lancaster gate station) and clean, newly renovated hotel. 
The facilities were really good - newspaper, good bed, coffee and water at the room. Great shower.
First we got a room with a noisy ventilator outside the window, but the staff was so helpful and immediately gave us a new room. A little pricey though, but I guess that's London.",4,2016,11,22
103,short stay in London,"We initially stayed at Park Grand Lancaster gate and as the room was tiny they moved us to Paddington Court which is nearby just around the corner. The room was larger with two twin beds, clean with modern decoration. strangely, mini bar was empty! but at least we could use the fridge. Staff were polite and professional. Breakfast was OK! but comparing to PG Lancaster Gate, it wasn't as fresh and nice. Overall, I have had good experience staying in Park Grand hotels and i would stay there again and recommend them.",4,2016,11,21
103,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel with very friendly and attentive staff, very clean, comfortable and well appointed room. Good value for money. Good location. We stayed for one night but could easily enjoy a weekend break here.",5,2016,11,21
103,An Excellent Stay,"Stayed at this hotel for a 2 night weekend. It was beautiful, clean and all the staff were very polite and helpful. Breakfast was lovely and it was useful being so close to the train and underground. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2016,11,19
103,Excellent choice !!!!!,"To the staff and Manager of Hotel

I stay recently in that Hotel and though frequent traveller to London I have to admit that finally I found “the” perfect Hotel.
Amazing service always with smile from anyone in the Hotel and great value for money
Way to go people !",5,2016,11,17
103,Tiny room but well appointed & good service,"I stayed at the Park Grand Paddington Court last night & I have to say that the experience was a good one.
My room was a deluxe single - it was very small (some might say cozy!) but it was fit for purpose & well appointed. My only criticism was the emergency green light in the room which helps direct you in case of emergency. Whilst I appreciate the importance of it, because the room was pretty small, it illuminated the whole room once the lights were turned off (I could've read a book by it)
The breakfast included in quite a competitive price for central London was really good. 
Lastly, the staff were all really friendly, efficient & helpful. This is so often not the case in major cities so I really appreciated that",4,2016,11,17
103,Excellent Stay,"Was looking for a place close to the Rail Station and my wife came across this one. I almost did not book as price was fair, but fair in London means not worth the price.  This is about my 15th time in London. Had an excellent stay and have found my new home for stays in overnight situations to London before flying out of Heathrow.  Perfect and clean and quiet.  Also went to hotel bar late in evening and bartender Mirko made the perfect Black Russian. Excellent barkeep and nice guy. He served while we had many laughs with a couple from Ireland.  Thanks for a great stay. ",5,2016,11,17
103,Location and breakfast is good.,I stayed in this hotel in November 2016 for my official trip. The hotel is clean and tidy but the Rooms are very small in size. The staff was very courteous and  helpful. The place is bit noisy. Everything you need in the room was available. The location is good and the breakfast too.,3,2016,11,17
103,Excellent!,A small property but has very efficient staff. Special mention to the front office and concierge staff that go out of the way to help and assist you with just about everything! Vey well located so travelling around becomes easy.,5,2016,11,15
103,I liked it,"Sometimes you know when you stay somewhere and you know its a hotel, well this felt different - a bit like being at home which made the stay a lot nicer even thought it was for 1 night. It was warm and clean and inviting and worth the money for one night
The hotel itself is clean and tidy and the staff are all very nice and friendly and very welcoming. 
I stayed in room 416  which was nice and quiet as it was at the back of the hotel, and i am sure this is what gave me a bad wifi signal for me to connect my laptop to for business work i needed to do. I had to give up
They do have which was a nice touch  mobile devices secured to the room to use and you can add your own apps and use as you woudl your own phone, but me being an IT consultant dont trust this and didnt use that facility.
The room itself was lovely and not too big but not too small either but the under floor heating in the shower is awesome and warmed the whole room itself up a treat.
I have not eaten here or had a drink here but it all looked very good quality and at a great price too. It is 5 minutes walk from Paddington station and the tube. 
As my HQ has a office close by I have been trying a few hotels to suit my taset and I think ihave found it and shall be staying here quite often from now on .",4,2016,11,15
103,"Fair hotel, location good...avoid breakfast","I spent two nights here last week, 10 November with my daughter. On the whole I was pleased with my choice.

Pros: 
Upgraded to deluxe room as read reviews of standard  rooms, hence comfortable for two
close proximity to Paddington Underground, railway station, easy bus connections to Oxford Street
Pleasant, welcoming staff at reception 

Cons: 
Avoid breakfast, save your money and go elsewhere. Pretty uninspiring and extra charge if you want a decent properly made cappuccino as opposed to standard weak hotel coffee.
Uninteresting bathroom shampoo, shower gel etc... an important touch missed.
Very compact bathroom.

",3,2016,11,15
103,A good find,"Very handy for Paddington a 7 - 10 minute walk. I was upgraded to a Club room, which was well appointed with a giant, comfy bed , huge TV screen but still a tad cramped.  Excellent shower  with lots of hot water and complimentary toiletries, just a shelf needed for a toilet bag.

Standard breakfast choices with very efficient staff.

only one problem I could not find how to turn the bedside lights off so had to take the key card out!",4,2016,11,15
103,Very clean and cute room with an equally nice bathroom,"Well attended to by reception staff who are friendly and helpful.
Good location, with a good Malaysian restaurant nearby. Walking distance to Paddington station and Hyde Park. Lots of nearby international restaurants.",4,2016,11,15
103,Excellent Hotel with outstanding service,"I stayed couple of nights in Deluxe Double Room, got good price offer while booking the hotel from booking.com. 
The hotel overall is really amazing, freshly renovated,clean, modern. The hotel is set  in a beautiful Victorian building so it looks amazing both on outside and inside. 
Hotel is located very close to underground station Paddington, just less than 5 min walk from it. So you get very easy access to subway to move within the city + you can very conveniently take a Paddington Express train to Heathrow Airport. Hotel is  also very close to Hyde Park (5 to 10 min walk). 
Room was spacious, renovated, very quiet and comfortable. Bathroom had heating floor system. The room  provided  the facilities to make tea, coffee - tea and coffee bags for free+ some cookies and bottles with water. Room was perfectly cleaned every day, I would say outstandingly cleaned! Very comfortable king sized bed.
In the room one gets a free mobile phone which has internet connection + free calls and sms within UK. So you can use the phone throughout the whole stay and use it in the city. It was very handy as it had GPS and made it easier to navigate in the city.
Personal of the hotel does exceptional work. Very polite and helpful. You will get help with getting your luggage into the room and can also use the hotel facilities to store your luggage after check out if you need. Would like to personally acknowledge the receptionist Monica who took care of my stay in hotel and made it flawless and absolutely pleasant. She did really great job. 
Important to know, that if you wish to get good deal for breakfast - it might be a good idea to make a booking directly from hotel, not via different agencies such as booking.com, as the hotel itself offers different discounts for breakfast, so you will get a better deal. Breakfast was nice, including traditional English breakfast and all sorts of food you could think of. 
Hotel is located in the area with a lot of restaurants, so it is very easy to find place to eat. You can also find a lot of different souvenir and food shops next to the hotel. 
Overall, I had enjoy my stay a lot and would definitely recommend this hotel for other visitors.",5,2016,11,15
103,Excellent location ,"I found this hotel by colleagues recommendation. Have no doubt with their room, cleanliness, wifi access, hotel facilities , breakfast and staff service. They do extra miles to make my stay enjoyable. Credit point to the manager who met me up during my check out time. Definitely would come back for business purpose to London.
 ",5,2016,11,11
103,The service was excellent as was our room,"The room was very clean and well furnished. The staff were very polite and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was excellent with a very large choice of dishes.
We have to visit London again next week and had no hesitation in booking a room again at your hotel. The area was very good with local restaurants and was within easy walking distance of two tube stations",5,2016,11,11
103,"Great rooms, excellent value","This is what I would describe as a boutique hotel.  It has very nicely appointed rooms for a very reasonable price in central London.  If you are looking for a hotel with a grand lobby and fancy restaurant, this is not the place for you.  However, if you are looking for reasonable prices, and a very nice room - this place is great.  I have stayed there twice - last time I had a much smaller room, but for some reason this time around, for the same price my room was much larger - two large chairs, sofa, and a mini kitchen.",5,2016,11,11
103,Excellent service with comfortable accommodations,"We had an excellent trip to London for the first time, in large part thanks to the staff and accommodations of Park Grand Paddington Court.  The location is incredibly convenient to Paddington for traveling to and from the airport, as well as being in walking distance to interesting, scenic portions of the city.  The staff were fantastic and upon learning we were celebrating a birthday AND a new engagement as the reason for our visit, seemed to take extra care to treat us special (including complimentary wine, dessert and adorable towel arrangements when we'd come home at night).  The cell phone (for those of us traveling from abroad) was incredibly useful for daytime touring.  The woman who met us initially, Laura, was friendly, gracious and polite and really set the tone for an excellent stay.  We will absolutely stay there again and are sad we didn't stay longer.  Thank you!",5,2016,11,08
103,Tiny rooms...Excellent facilities ,"Overall we had amazing stay...breakfast was superb! Facilities and cleanliness was excellent. Only thing was that the club room and bathroom were extremely small, especially with an infant it got a bit crammed. The staff were very accommodating and professional and would go out of their way to help us any way they could...the personal travel phone was a huge plus as it's helped us navigate around London being first time visitors! Loved our stay and would surely recommend this place. ",4,2016,11,07
103,I wouldn't stay here again.,"Stayed here for 1 night after a 29 hour journey. I had asked the hotel through booking.com when I booked for an early check in because of this. Checked in to be told that my room wasn't ready. I then advised the check in staff that I had requested an early check in. He made the effort and found an available room and told me I had been upgraded to a ""club""room.
I was given my key and headed off to where it appeared the lifts were, got on the lift to my room which was 504 (from memory) only to find the lift only went to level 4. I presumed that maybe I had a set of stairs to get to level 5 - no.
Went back to reception and asked one of the concierge staff who told me that my room was actually across the road in a separate building. They were ""extremely busy"" ensuring that they were happy with Halloween decorations in the reception area.
I went out the door across the road and into the lift, again the lift only went to the 4th floor, where was this mystery room?
Back across the road and asked again where room 504 was. As this stage a concierge staff member led me across the road and showed me that level 5 was actually the basement level (read dungeon).
The room was through a convoluted series of doors as room tend to be in converted English hotels. Finally getting to the room, and my upgraded room smelt unpleasantly of chlorine.
Overall I was happier to leave this hotel than I was to arrive after 29 hours travel.
Would I stay with them again - no way. Overall a poor experience.",2,2016,11,07
103,"Modern, exceptionally clean, well appointed and convenient with very polite and helpful staff","This is the fourth time I've used these rooms. Although small, they are very well appointed and exceptionally clean. They're reasonably priced for central London and are a perfect overnight solution for business trips. 

Roney was especially helpful when checking me in, taking time to ensure my phone and iPad were connected to the wifi.",5,2016,11,06
103,Good hotel with great location,"This was very good hotel beside the Hyde Park.  Easy access to and from airport, just short walking distance to Heathrow express station.  Comfy and tidy room. The only negative was very hard pillow (like a rock...). Nice service was newspaper to room each morning.",4,2016,11,06
103,Very good hotel,"Stayed here for five days in a suite and I was very happy with the hotel and its amenities.

Staff are very friendly and helpful, breakfast buffet does the job although some may say the selection is limited I thought it was adequate.

I would most certainly stay here again.",4,2016,11,05
103,Doesn't get much better,"Beautiful hotel and apartments, furnished to a very high standard and a short walk from Paddington station so very handy. Restaurant is very nice too, food wonderful, had the Indian option which was delicious.",5,2016,11,04
103,Always have a Grand Experience,"I have stayed at this hotel multiple times for both business and leisure and I am yet to have a negative thing to say or notice.  It is always my first choice when looking for accommodation in London that is still near all of the central tube lines, but also allows for a sense of escapism from the hustle and bustle of Londontown.  I would highly recommend staying here for either business or leisure.  The staff are always friendly and accommodating, the rooms are made to make use of the space and it always has a relaxed atmosphere, which immediately puts you at ease.  I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!",5,2016,11,03
103,Value for money,We stayed at Grand Park Paddington for 3days. The location of the hotel is veery quiet and also is very convicient as it is near Hyde Park and very close to lancaster gate. The room is clean and the service excellent. Great breakfast,4,2016,11,02
103,Awesome hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here for a week. We got to the hotel super early in the morning, our room wasn't ready but they held our luggage for us. It is in walking distance to Kensington Park and Paddington Station. And if you are feeling saucy, you can walk to Oxford Street shopping area. Don't bother with their breakfast, there are a couple cheaper places right around the corner. The room was small, by american standards, but comfy. Besides we weren't sitting in the hotel room all day, it's just a place to sleep and get dressed. The staff was super nice. The bar area is small. You can also print for free. There is also a microwave and refrigerator in the room.",5,2016,11,02
103,Great stay,"We, my partner and I, stayed here before, in May this year. We chose it, because of the close proximity to Paddington station, and the reviews.  We were warmly welcomed this time, by Alex, and, being Halloween, asked us if we wanted a photo taken with a mask, we said yes, of course, Alex asked a colleague to take it, then Alex put it on Facebook, which he duly did, later in the day. We booked breakfast for Tuesday, on arrival,  We were upgraded to a club room.. A member of staff, by the way, were all foreign, but didn't worry us, or make any difference to our stay, showed us to our room, number 21, on first floor. The hotel was spotlessly clean, all around, our room , which was very nice, again spotlessly clean, had an amazing super king size bed !!! And the room even had a microwave, and a fridge !!!!  The breakfast, was good, everything you wanted, and you can eat all you wanted. Staff were efficient, and smiled... All in all, a very nice stay, Yes will definitely stay here, again. The only thing we can gripe about, was the fact we ran out of milk, today ( Weds 2nd November ) my partner got dressed, and asked reception for some more. Was told it would be taken to us. It was never delivered, after about half hour. This was our only bad point.",4,2016,11,02
103,Excellent location,Stayed here for 2 nights while on a theatre break in London. Close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Buffet breakfast was up there with the best of them.  Room very clean but a little on the small side but this didn't bother us.  Would stay here again without hesittion,4,2016,10,31
103,Great Hotel,"I found this hotel have a lot of features: 
convenient location to Paddington station & hyde park - new clean comfy rooms - helpful staff - very reasonable rate.

Definitely I will stay in Park Grand again.

",5,2016,10,31
103,Great Stay!,"We stayed at Park Grand Paddington Court over several occasions in a few rooms.  The location is good and quiet, and the rooms are clean.  Best of all, the staff are very friendly and helpful.  We have enjoyed our stay and would return.  Thank you Manager Alex and all the front desk staff and all the porters!",4,2016,10,30
103,Traditional London Accomadations,"We stayed at the Park Grand Paddington Court for 4 days and were very satisfied with the stay. Excellent staff , very friendly and helpful with any questions or requests. The accommodations are very stylish and well appointed. Very modern features, great TV. and bathroom. Excellent breakfast provided every morning with large selection including made to order items. Our room was quite small but this was expected in an older traditional building. All the other amenities including close proximity to Paddington tube and train station, nearby restaurants, pubs made the stay very memorable. ",4,2016,10,29
103,Wonderful 24 hr. Stay,"Wonderful staff assisted my every desire. Answered questions, printed maps, even walked me and I am not a senior citizen. My room was clean, breakfast had plenty of choice. Paddington train station is just around the corner. Overall lovely indeed. 
I suggest if wanting to do the unusual, walk to Little Venice and Rembrandt gardens. 
Thank you Park Grand Paddington for a lovely stay. ",5,2016,10,26
103,"Good location, but ...","I was looking for a hotel nearby Paddington Station,
what I found was
> a ridiculously small room in poor condition
> staff hardly speaking any English
> an invoice amount in excess of the rate confirmed with my booking",1,2016,10,26
103,Average Hotel,"Stayed in this hotel weekend of 23rd September for three nights.  This hotel is 7/8 minutes from Paddington Station.  Rooms are small.  We were told we were ""upgraded"" to a basement bedroom! It was a small bedroom, with a 4' 6"" lumpy bed.  The view out of the window was awful.  Soiled carpets on stairs.  No lounge area except a cafe type bar.  Given a leaky iron and when I went to unplug it, the entire casing came away from the wall leaving wires hanging out.  Breakfast was fine, but they were constantly running out of one type of food or other.  Best thing about the stay was the mobile phone that is allocated to the room with internet.  Would I stay there again..definitely ""no"".",3,2016,10,25
103,Multum in Parvo,"""Much in little' sums up this slightly odd hotel.  Rooms are in several recently redeveloped Georgian buildings on both sides of the street.  A cheerful uniformed porter led me across the road, though a front door, up two flights in a lift, then along a corridor, up another flight on foot, then a door, then another flight and then the room.  ""De luxe"" room is very small but very well appointed with comfy bed, tiny bathroom with shower.  Welcome fresh fruit (!!), small bottle of wine, biscuits, cans of Sprite, bottled water.  Bathroom had so many freebies (well hardly free at London hotel prices) that there wasn't room to set them out.  Included toothbrush, shaving equipment, sewing, as well a loads of shower gel, shampoo, etc. Free mobile phone (not to take away of course) with free European calls.  TV, iron, ironing board (though you'd have difficulty finding space to erect it).  Breakfast is extra, and reasonably good, though jams are rather cheap variety.  Air-conditioned",4,2016,10,24
103,"Excellent hotel, highly recommend ","We enjoyed staying at this wonderful, well located, service oriented hotel. 
The staff is so welcoming and enthusiastic to make your stay pleasant (especially Alex, the senior at the reception). The hotel is very clean and well equipped. We definitely be back soon.
Meir& Meirav from Israel👍🏽",5,2016,10,24
103,"Good business hotel, but nothing special","+ Room ready sooner than I thought
+ very helpful young guy from Bulgaria
- rooms small
- shower pressure minimal
+ hotel provides you with a smart phone with internet. This is really a good idea even though I had my own with me and thus didn't have to use it

Surely I could return if the room rate is reasonable as it was.",3,2016,10,23
103,Good service,"We booked in on Booking.com and at a reasonable 120£ rate. This is a group of hotels which is good as the first one we booked into had a broken boiler so they moved us to another one only a few hundred yards away. The service was very good and this hotel is modern and the rooms functional and well appointed so in my view a good experience.
We also ate in the hotel and the food was adequate and you just accept the London prices.",4,2016,10,23
103,"Small rooms, good standard","We got a room with a very small bed and it was sensitively from outside. Small room but good service and nice staff. 
And very nice stay even though bad nights sleep! I recommend this hotel for single travelers or couples who wants to lie very, very close :)",4,2016,10,21
103,Small room but Comfy,"I stayed in a Deluxe Double Room. The room was clean, tidy and nicely furnished. Bed was a double and was very comfortable. Location was great - 5 min walk to Paddington station. 

Not a lot of empty space in this room. You walk in, bathroom is to the right and the rest of the room is dominated by the bed. TV is on the wall in front, one side has a cupboard with minibar, fridge, safe, hanging space for clothes, etc. other side of the bed has a small desk. 

I had 2 pieces of luggage which I kept on the desk side. It was ok for me as I was by myself and I stayed only 2 nights, but I did wonder if I was here with a partner where would he put his bags. 

Bathroom clean and modern, but not much bench space and the water pressure was on the low side. 

An unexpected bonus was that they provide you with a smart phone that you can use during your stay to make local calls and use the internet. I found this most handy as I was able to look up things and use maps to help me when I was getting around. I could save using my own data which was good. A great idea. 

My advice is if you are travelling alone this room would be fine, if travelling with a partner, I'd get a bigger room.",4,2016,10,19
103,"Nice hotel, helpful staff","Hotel is at great location, just few minutes from station Lancaatwr and Paddington station .so you are in central London in 10-15 minutes.staff is extremlly helpful, rioms are clean.only problem , but I think in in all London are small rooms.But not a big issue for us.",5,2016,10,18
103,Amazing location and beautiful hotel,"We arrived very late but to a cheery, helpful staff. The room was lovely and the beds very comfortable. Ours was typically small as you find in the U.K. and Europe but we don´t mind this. One teeny, tiny detail is that there is no counter space for toiletries (any designer should think this through better). We loved the location, near to Paddington and great restaurants, the park, etc...We will stay here again for certain.",5,2016,10,17
103,"Cosy, comfortable stay in London",We had a wounderful stay at Park Grand Paddington Court. With accommodating staff and nice facilitys the establishment reached our expectations.  I would recomend this hotel to anyone who vistis London and want to live close to the city centre.,4,2016,10,17
103,Good review for The Park Grand,"My wife and I had a lovely experience at the Park Grand this week.
We were well escorted to our first room by a cordial bellman. Who explained everything including the complimentary phone/tourist guide.
After he left, we found that there was no tub in the room and heating was not working. We called housekeeping who arrived promptly and fixed the electrical heating problem. But as my wife
is a tad sickly, I was afraid the lack of heating might reappear in the middle of the night and be very inconvenient.
So I went to the front desk and asked for another room. Within 5 minutes, the clerk had found another room B-15 which was very much to our liking having heat, a bath tub, and a complimentary dish of fruit (all at no extra charge). However, there was no microwave when we arrived but that was
remedied almost instantaneously. B-15 was enormously comfortable, quiet, and well located. We left yesterday delighted with the room and the hotel.
We have stayed at your hotel many times over the years and this stay/room was by far the best. We stay at your hotel because it is conveniently located to Paddington Station and offers good value. We will certainly recommend the Park Grand to all our friends who sojourn to London.",4,2016,10,16
103,Great location. ,"Prime location, 5 minute walk to Hyde Park and walking distance to all the districts. Don't bother taking the metro, if you can walk I recommend it. It's the best way to see the city. 

The room and elevators are quite small but very adorable but if you're used to American standards be aware of the size - it is still manageable. My friend and I shared a room and it was just cozy. The staff was very helpful and friendly. 

The only bad thing I would say is that the windows are a bit creaky and when it was windy the window would rattle and make noise throughout the day and night. Nothing major to complain about. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. ",4,2016,10,13
103,"Lovely clean room, but with a small bathroom...","Stayed for one night with my husband. Our room was on the other side of the road on the top floor so a bit of a hike for breakfast in the morning! The room was clean and well presented, but the bath was very small, with hardly any room around the sink making it difficult for a wash and cleaning your teeth. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good for a mass produced meal and had fresh crusty bread which was a nice touch.",3,2016,10,13
103,Quiet Gem,"Great hotel just a short walk from paddington station, friendly staff comfortable rooms, bathroom a little small and shower could do with a rubber safety mat almost slipped while getting in. Great breakfast, eat as much or as little as you want",4,2016,10,13
103,Wonderful People,"Stayed here last month for 2 nights .The people here are wonderful from the doormen to the butler and the reception .
Very helpful and always wear a smile. Breakfast spread is the typical British breakfast(Bacon, beans , eggs) . Hotel room is very small for my size (i'm asian 5 feet).
Location is good , 15 minutes walking distance to Paddington Station",4,2016,10,11
103,Loved staying here,"I stayed here in October, 2016.  I was traveling alone and wanted to keep the trip budget friendly, so I opted for a room with a twin bed.  The room was cozy and comfortable.  

The hotel staff is great. I go there quite early and the front desk did they best to get me a room.  The concierge staff were great in helping me plan my activities and outings.  Zdarov was great, and so was Marius.

Hotel provides a cell phone for use in town.  Came in very handy (it's actually called Handy) in getting around town, even included free phone calls.

It is very conveniently located from Paddington Station, Hyde Park, Harrods, Nottinghill  and so many other attractions.  If you aren't up for the walk, the underground is nearby and plenty of taxi's about.",5,2016,10,10
103,Excellent customer service. Polite staff,"Very clean room and the amenities therein. Generally, it was an interesting and unforgettable stay. Safe location, easily accessible. Valentin Fenardes, a particularly interesting personality to meet at the hotel",5,2016,10,08
103,Wonderful Accomodation,"We arrived at this chains sister hotel after an overnight flight from Canada and were advised there was problem with our room but they immediarely had us transported to the Park Grand by complimentary car for check in there. We were welcomed by a highly trained and customer oriented reception desk who did everything possible to make our stay comfortable. The concierge, porters, everyone, look after their guests like you were the most important person on site. The rooms of this older building were totally refurbished in modern comfortable upscale fashion,a total delight. Only drawback was a little noisy occasionally due to our proximity to the elevator, but not a major issue. The breakfast was excellent with ample choices and the staff there, showed the same high level of service and courtesy that we experienced throughout the property. The property is conveniently located within 5 minute walking time to Paddington, down the street to Hyde Park and convenient to many Restaurants and Pubs. We have since recommended this property to family in England and would not hesitate to return on future trips. Kudos to the Park Grand Paddington for making our stay so pleasant.",5,2016,10,07
103,Very Comfortable Hotel in A Great Location,"Staff were friendly and helpful, they allowed me to keep my luggage after checkout for the rest of the day. The area around the hotel is quiet. There are few grocery shops, gift shops  and restaurants close to the hotel. Paddington train and underground stations are less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel. On the negative side I only have two minor points: (1) The room was a little bit small, but was okey for a solo traveler. (2) The fire alarm rang on both of the two days of my stay at around 8:00 a.m. and despite being a false alarm it was a bit disquieting.",5,2016,10,06
103,Another lovely stay! ,"Stayed here for the second time in August for my boyfriends birthday. 
Once again, I cannot fault the staff, very helpful, friendly and cannot do enough for you. 
As I booked a suite for this stay, it was in a separate building across the road. 
The room was decorated nicely, easy to get too and clean! 
The only issue we had was my partner waking me up 5am Sunday morning to a high pitched alarm going off outside our room. However when I contacted reception they came out immediately to resolve the issue so cannot fault there. 
There's plenty to do around the hotel, nice pubs, and restaurants! So won't be disappointed ",5,2016,10,05
103,Modern hotel with good service and location,"We stayed one night recently in Sept 2016. Hotel is in excellent location and nearby to 2 tube staions, the Lancaster Gate (Central line)  and Paddington (Bakerloo and others). Our bedroom (on the 1st Floor)  was modern and very clean. Mattress was soft and very comfortable. Aircon was very quiet. A quiet room and no traffic noise until later in the morning about 7am. We had  a deluxe room but yet it is a small bedroom ..just enough space for 1 slim or small adult to walk round bed. It will be ok for single person. For couples it will be ok for 1 or 2 nights or if one is not going to stay in the room all day.

Excellent service by reception staff, porters and in restaurant at breakfast. Staff were friendly, polite and professional. Buffet breakfast was adequate and you can request eggs cooked differently than those offerred on the buffet.

Shower room was small but very clean. Just enough space for one person at a time.

Room has free wifi and safe. Very good lighting. No chairs to sit on as there is no space for it. 

Room came with a smart phone that you can take out with you to use with free (yes free) unlimited internet data and free UK calls. Very helpful as I used it to use the GPS for maps to get around London and for the tube stations map. 

Will I stay at his hotel again...Yes I would but for short stays up to 3 nights due to the size of the room. Unsure if there are larger rooms.

(Please note that there is another sister hotel called Park Grand Paddington just further down the street. We went to check in to the wrong one. So be warned)",5,2016,10,04
103,"Nice hotel, good location","Chose this hotel as close to Heathrow express. Lovely hotel with nice decor. Location was good, plenty of restaurants near by. We booked club room,bathroom was smallest I have ever seen, did provide all required. You are escorted to your room & given a tour of room. This was over top for me, some people will like, I stay in plenty of hotels so don't need training. Would have liked to have seen money spent elsewhere, the toilet paper was of extremely poor quality, breakfast could have had more choice.",4,2016,10,02
103,Superb hospitability ,"Great hotel in d nice part of London. Close to Hyde park. 
Really nice service . Rooms a little small.. But you expect that from a central London hotel. 
Superb service from Valent , Roney & Dario and all d other guys at reception and service.
Superb. Will deifinetly visit again
Cheers !!

103,Park Grand Paddington,"Lovely modern hotel in a great part of London. Only minutes away from Hyde Park, Ideal for business or pleasure. The hotel was very clean and the staff helped with my every need. Would 100% recommend the Park Grand Paddington.",5,2016,09,28
103,Early hiccup,"We arrived at this hotel late at night after 20 hours in a plane, tired and needing a bed.  When we asked to check in the person on reception informed us that due to maintenance problems our room was not available but he would give us a room in the basement.  When we protested he insisted there was no option and we would not get any discount for the inconvenience, however he later relented and offered us free breakfast for the next morning.  We were too tired to priotest anymore so made our way into this tiny room which was musty and the carpet had certainly seen better days.  The bedding and bathroom thankfully was clean.
The next day they did move us into a room on the 3rd floor which was bigger and brighter and although still small was much bigger than the other one.  We found a letter when we arrived back from the manager thanking us for the inconvenience and offering us the gift of some fruit, only problem being that there was no fruit in sight!  Never mind.
The hotel is in close proximity to Paddington station which makes it easy to get around London and is also serviced by the Heathrow Express which is only 15 mins from airport.  Three stars only because of the early glitch.",3,2016,09,26
103,Prime location and friendly staff,"Returned to this hotel after a few years. Last time was a disaster, but I must say that Prak Grand Paddington Court has ""upped their game""...and we'll be back in the future.

We had made reservations for Club Twin rooms, and it paid of to spend the extra money if you want a bit more space. The rooms were very clean and great service from staff.

The hotel is situated in walking distance from Marple Arch/Oxford Street (about 15 min.), Hyde Park (3 min) and Notting Hill (about 20 min). Hop-on-Hop-off The Original Tour and The Big Bus both have stops near the hotel.

Great stay at a great hotel!",4,2016,09,26
103,Not coming back,"Nice but not the best location, 5 mins from Paddington station. 5 mins from Hyde Park. The best thing is if you're going to Heathrow via Heathrow express the station is near. A great thing that they provide the guests with a mobile phone with free calls and unlimited internet ""free of charge"". Very tiny room and bed, it wasn't a good sleep for two persons. Not enough space to put the luggage. Very small shower for a big guy like me, I had to squeeze in and out!",3,2016,09,26
103,"Great hotel, great location","My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our wedding anniversary. It was a special occasion and we were delighted to be upgraded to a Club Room and to be welcomed with a bottle of wine.
We enjoyed our stay very much and found the location most convenient. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
We would be happy to stay in this hotel again and to recommend it to our friends.",5,2016,09,21
103,Location good. Clean room. ,But mega small. And kinda crappie breakfast. Staff ok. All more or less medium. Tourist crowd with blue hair.london sold out and this is where I landed. And for some reason TripAdvisor wants 200 words so I continue.,3,2016,09,20
103,smiley staff -  great b.fast small room- great location,i'll be back for very smiley staff (mostly trainee)  -  great b.fast- great waiters - small room- great location i'm sure during my next trip to london will stay again bu i wish to have a larger room next time,4,2016,09,20
103,Great location,Great hotel. 5 minute walk to Paddington Station and also a 5 minute walk to Hyde Park. Nice and clean hotel. Room small but okay. Great breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Very nice bathroom and clean towels every day. World certainly recommend it to anyone travelling to London and would stay there again myself.,4,2016,09,19
103,Great exterior and easy access to Paddington Rail,We've stayed in a number of similar places in London and this is the same in terms of smallness of rooms etc.  It did have the advantage of concierges to carry our luggage which is always helpful.  about 700m from Paddington tube and rail station so convenient for Heathrow express.  12 pm check out is handy.,4,2016,09,19
103,"Great location and Service, Small Room","This hotel was in a great location, about 5 minute to paddington station. I stayed in a single room so the space was small, but expected. All amenities were very nice and the staff were all very helpful. The hotel was very clean and I always felt safe. It's located within a 10-15 minute walk to Kensington Palace and Gardens which is very peaceful and quiet. You can also walk a different direction and find plenty of options for quick food and drink options. I would recommend to a friend and stay there again.",5,2016,09,18
103,pleasant hotel,"There's many hotels in the Paddington area that are redesigned Georgian terrace buildings.This is a typical hotel in this area.It's in a great location near Paddington station and trains to Heathrow, and the Underground.Which allows me to enjoy London before I travel.Though travelling on the Bakerloo line is still horrible.
 My room was on the ground floor just behind the bar and next to a lift and toilets, so I was worried I might be kept awake at night gladly I wasn't disturbed once and slept soundly all three nights.  I'm a single traveller and my room was small, but clean and okay for me.
Breakfast was fine, it was a bit chaotic at 9am on the Sunday, on Monday I chose earlier 8am and it  was more civilised and the staff were less stressed, with a choice of tea or coffee, a continental breakfast, cereal ,baked beans, mushrooms sausages and bacon.
Wifi was reasonably quick too.
Staff were efficient and polite and  had a very pleasant stay.",4,2016,09,18
103,Room very small,"Good location and price was reasonable. Breakfast is not very well organised, the room was very small. If you are just staying a night or two this hotel maybe good for what you are looking for, for longer stays the room size may put you off.",3,2016,09,17
103,"Great location, great service - you get what you pay for","I've had some bad experiences at hotels in London who claim to provide a 4 star experience but don't. Park Grand Paddington Court, however, delivered. I arrived around 10am, so I wasn't able to access my room just yet, but they still completed my check in and securely stowed my luggage so I could go about my business. When I returned later that afternoon I was promptly given my key and shown to my room by a member of staff who showed me all the bells and whistles, like the complimentary mobile that can be taken from the room and used around town to make calls and to use maps. Apparently calls and data are complimentary, but I didn't need to use it so I can't vouch for it. If it does what they say it does then it's brilliant for people visiting from outside the UK. 

I was in a third floor room just off the elevator lobby with a window to the rear of the property. I had zero problems with noise from the corridor or from outside. My room was a deluxe double, which would be small if you're used to North American hotel rooms, but by London standards it was spacious. The bed was comfortable, the shower luxurious, the toiletries were perfectly adequate, and the room was well-appointed. I was impressed with features such as plug sockets for UK, European and North American electronic devices, and the service/sleeping/do not disturb lights. Wifi was free and the signal was strong in my room (318).

I was told my room package included a 'continental' breakfast, so I was expecting a few stale pastries and instant coffee. What it actually turned out to be was quite a nice spread of various hot and cold breakfast items, ranging from sausage and eggs to cereal and cold meats (if you're into that). They didn't have heaps of it out all at once, so everything was fresh and hot, with good variety, and they monitored it all so nothing ever ran out. I really don't have anything bad to say! 

The hotel is just under 10 minutes walk from Paddington, and even closer to Lancaster Gate (Central line). The 390 and 205 buses also run near by, which take you along Oxford St and Marylebone/Euston respectively, so it's really well connected. 

If you're on a budget obviously this sort of hotel isn't for you, but if you do have a little more to spend this hotel is worth it, and for London, it's a good price too. I hope to stay here again soon.",5,2016,09,16
103,Compliment,"I stayed in Park Grand Paddington group many times, i was very satisfied with hotel staff, cleaning and hotel location. Special thanks to Mr Valent, Ms Corina and Ms Sara and all reception and concierge team for their great service and assistance to me and my colleagues during our stay..",5,2016,09,15
103,great experience,"Great service, very friendly and helpful staff. Perfect location, close to underground, good breakfast options.
Deluxe double room was too small, it barely fit 2 people. We upgraded to the club room which was much better.",5,2016,09,14
103,Good location. Reasonably priced. ,"The hotel is quite good location, close to Paddington Station, with some restaurants around. Room very clean, a bit small. 
The shower, though, very weak , can be improved. But otherwise value for money ok.",4,2016,09,14
103,Another great hotel in Paddington!,"Location is very convenient.  Less than 10 minutes walk to the Paddington station.  Rooms are clean and bedrooms size are slightly bigger than the nearby Park Grand Lancaster Gate.  Front staffs are all very helpful, especially Michael, who patiently explained to us the room we checked in was the Club room even though there was no ""Club Room"" sign shown on the door.

Breakfast was served in buffet style and plenty of selections. Apart from Park Grand Lancaster Gate, this will be another great hotel in this area.",5,2016,09,14

Other Information - Also this hotel chain has other hotels in this area that makes it confusing. We actually were booked to stay in one of their other hotels nearby and were shifted to this hotel with no explanation why. The hotel did compensate us with complimentary breakfast",3,2016,09,13
103,"Apparent quality, strange smell in the room","The hotel could go up to max 4, due to very small rooms, the water remained in the sink for 20 mins after I washed my hands and there was a terrible smell over the night in my room. Very clean otherwise, comfie bed and if were not the smell, I could have go for a 4. 
Looks like the tried to refurbish but u wonder what's under the refurbishment considering the smell...",3,2016,09,13
103,Good value hotel for a Sunday night,"The hotel is in an excellent location if you are travelling into and out of London via Paddington. The hotel was modern, spotlessly clean and the staff couldn't do enough to help you. The continental breakfast was adequate and there was a good selection of both hot and cold food. We were upgraded to a club room on arrival. The room itself was adequate but the bathroom was very small with a shower only. This suited us fine. 
I would definitely stY in this hotel again. Cost for two rooms on a Sunday night was £219 which represented good value for money. ",4,2016,09,13
103,What I learned from this booking of a  Deluxe Double room,"Hi
Our stay was just fine  and the staff are absolutely lovely and very helpful,  but I did learn something from this booking. 
The room at the  Park Grand was  really small ... nothing wrong with it, nicely furnished, modern and clean,  with a comfortable bed and a great shower, but I have had a bigger double bedroom on a ferry. The bed was bounded on 3 sides by the walls.. apart from a small gap  at the end of the bed that you may be able to squeeze your luggage into if it is narrow enough. I found that 2 people standing in front of the  wardrobe felt  really cramped and one of us had to sit down, so not really my expectation of something described as a Deluxe double.

So this is what I learnt. This building is one of those buildings from a bygone era  that you see all over Europe, when the staff quarters were on the top floor ... there is typically no lift to the top and they carve  a huge number of small rooms into the space. 
In a city I like to book a room on a higher floor as it generally is quieter. I now know to look out for buildings from this era, as the room size will probably  be smaller the higher up in the building you go. If the windows are smaller at the top,  request a lower floor.

We   were only staying for a night, so all in all it was  OK and we know what to look out for next time.",3,2016,09,13
103,"Great hotel, fabulous staff!","We've been to this hotel for a week in August with a 2 years old.
We've taken the Club Double Room. The room was great, with a lot of space, modern design, very clean and pleasent. There was a small kitchen well equipped, more than just a coffee and tea kit, which helped us a lot.
Breakfast was great and the staff at the dinning room was really great and thoughtfull for our needs with the child.
The reception staff was very helpfull before and during our stay, and we did have some requests for them.
One of the best things was having a cellular phone with free data and local phone calls provided by the hotel to take with us around. We planned to buy local SIM but we didn't need to. 
This is about the 7th hotel I've been to in London, and it will be the one for me in the coming trips.
We really enjoied our stay!",5,2016,09,13
103,Perfect accommodation,"This is my second time staying at the Grand Park and this visit was just as lovely if not better than my first stay. The staff make you feel very welcome and although the front desk seems to always be super busy they never look stressed or cranky. Door men wonderful with luggage and helping with taxis. We stayed in the club room which an added bonus (we only booked for standard twin). Perfect location for site seeing. Tube station not too far from hotel. Not much the way of cafes in the paddington area but plenty once you get into the Oxford Circus area. I would recommend this hotel if you're looking for comfort, good location and decent price. Super modern and spotless, I'll definitely be staying here for a third time on my next trip to London!",4,2016,09,12
103,Business trip of 14 persons group,"The location is great. The neighborhood is quiеt and pleasant, very close to underground and bus stations, 5 mins from Hyde park. If you have the opportunity for  whole day walking, you can easy reach many sights on foot.
The rooms are small, clean and comfortable. The staff is very polite, especially Zdravko - he is very positive and always ready to support. He helped a lot to arrange many of the details regarding the traveling and our stay in the hotel.",4,2016,09,12
103,A good hotel in a good location,"I stayed here for one night in April 2016 with my husband. I would say this is a boutique hotel mainly suitable for adults.
The rooms are compact BUT they don't feel small, well not if you're out in London all day and just need somewhere to sleep. They are well designed too with good lighting.

Good points:
- Clean
- Modern
- Good decor
- Good location
- Polite staff
- Lovely breakfast

Could be better:
- Service at reception was a little slow although they were busy when we were there. It would be good if staff could acknowledge guests waiting at the reception even if they are not able to assist them straight away.
- They were keen for a member of staff to carry our bags and show us to our room (we only had a light and small overnight case each). Whilst the member of staff was very helpful we did feel obliged to tip. It wasn't a big deal, we just prefer to sort ourselves out.
- The bar shuts at around 11pm or 12am, I am not sure. We went out somewhere else for drinks instead. It would have been nice for the bar to stay open later (it was a Saturday) for guests in the hotel. If it had been open later then we would probably have returned there for drinks after our meal out.

Bad points:
- None.

I would definitely stay here again. I managed to get a good price (for London) when I stayed. I did look at their website tonight to book two rooms for 8th October but the price is much higher which is a shame as it's above what I want to pay.",4,2016,09,11
103,Mr,"Great location.Clean ant tiny rooms, too small for me.Helpful stuff, especially Zdravko we felt very welcomed and supported all the time.His recommendations were very helpful for our staying in London.

Danail, Bulgaria",4,2016,09,11
103,Great little hotel,"Rooms well appointed though a bit small. Very attentive staff great service. Good value for money, near Hyde Park. Exceptional breakfast I thought, plenty of choice. No mini bar though 12oclock check time which was great as we could walk off the breakfast in the park. Good choice of local shops would stay here again.",5,2016,09,10
103,Perfect choice!,"Alex, Jana and Michael, welcomed us and made us feel right at home. Found in our room a plate of fresh fruit and a bottle of wine, which was a great start to a very pleasant six day stay. All of the hotel staff were most friendly and couldn't do enough for us. The breakfast was substantial with a huge choice of hot/cold food, including fresh fruit and cold meats. Comfy beds, whiter than white towels changed daily; the perfect location for any visitor to London and we highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in London.",5,2016,09,09
103,4 day business trip for one,For me on my own on a business trip the hotel was fine and a convenient location. But it did seem a but expensive. For a couple on holiday I would rate it higher. The room was on the small side - I'd say compact rather than small. Just the boutiqueness was a bit wasted on me. Staff were really attentive. The rooms are split between buildings so you may have to cross the road for breakfast - I wonder if the staff would be on hand with umbrellas if needed? ,3,2016,09,09
103,Worked well for us,"We were two couples needing two rooms.  It was convenient because we could take the Heathrow Express to Paddington Station and schlepp our luggage to the hotel, which was about 5 blocks away.
The rooms are very small, but clean and functional.  Considering it had the lowest prices that I could find in the area I was very happy.  Especially nice was that each room came with a complimentary smart phone with international calling. So we could call home ... something we couldn't manage to do with our own phones. That was nice.  
The wait staff was very friendly and helpful.  
My only complaint would be that the path to our room was a complicated series of doors, hallways and short flights of steps.",4,2016,09,07
103,Tiny rooms but well apointed,"My room was very small with almost no floor space, it was very diificult to walk around the bed. Luckily I had a ""double room"" for single occupancy. Nowhere to open a suitcase. 
The room itself was finished to a high standard and was clean and comfortable, if a bit cramped
The location was good but the price was high",3,2016,09,07
103,Best in terms of service and property amongst the sister hotels,"Spent about 13 days in a row at this hotel and return for another 9 days, 21 days in total. This has been the overall best hotel in terms of service provided and the property amongst the sister hotels that I have stayed.

My utmost appreciation and gratefulness to Mr Valent who has been CONSISTENTLY professional, attentive, diligent, customer oriented and helpful without fail ensuring the room assigned are functional and other requests are promptly looked into and resolved. What i valued most is the consistency.

Other team members that worth complimenting are Michael, Sara, Alex, Radzwan, Cipriano (breakfast room) and Monica who uphold the service quality of the hotel.

Two minor areas that could be slightly improved are i) at the breakfast room i.e. to tone down the clearing the crockery & cutleries while also setting up the tables with clean ones. ii) Also HDMI power point/connection in certain rooms not functioning.

I would not hesitate to return to this hotel or recommend to anybody else due to the staff here are consistent in providing quality service and stay.

Well done and keep up the good work consistently!",5,2016,09,06
103,A nice stay,"Booked into the Park Grand Paddington hotel. Reception was busy and had to wait to be seen when I tried to check in was informed that I had to move to this hotel which is like next door but in the same brand. This wasn't a major problem for me.  The hotel itself Is modern and staff all very friendly.  I booked into a club room which wasn't a bad size for London. The room was well kept, modern and most important very clean!  Hotel is well located for underground etc. Breakfast was hot and not a bad selection and you have water and tea and coffee in the room. Overall for the price I paid it was good value for London and would consider staying again. ",4,2016,09,04
103,"Good location, nice accommodation","This was a good location, walking distance from Paddington and Marylebone . We had an upgrade to a studio suite which was good as we had a fridge- great in hot weather.
Reception staff were efficient and helpful. Room was clean and modern. Only criticism was room backed onto front door which was noisy from other guests.
I would stay again",4,2016,08,31
103,Perfect temporary retreat from the busy city,"I was pleasantly surprised as we booked an advanced payment deal including breakfast and didn't know what to expect. By London standards the cost was low so I assumed there would be evidence of this in my stay over. Not so. This hotel covers every base. Clean, fully functional room and ensuite, a good quality breakfast and friendly staff.  I have stayed in basement rooms before and can only describe them as terrible so my stomach sank when directed to the basement area. The room was well furnished, bright and finally....no mould smell. There is air conditioning and a heated bathroom floor with decent shower. This hotel is now on my short list of places to stay in London.",4,2016,08,31
103,Excellent base for seeing the sights,"I stayed for 2 nights with my husband for our wedding anniversary and we met friends who stayed one night. Because it was our anniversary, we were upgraded to a club room on arrival, and the staff left romantic decor and a gift of wine, which was a charming & appreciated surprise. The room was very clean, modern, comfortable and had very good air con, definitely a plus given the record temperatures. The room was very quiet despite the hotel being only 5 mins walk from Paddington Station. We could not praise the quality of the staff enough, they were so helpful and pleasant, and we will look to stay again when we next come to London.",5,2016,08,30
103,Value for money,"Nice hotel in the centre of London. Apart from the fact that the rooms are very small (including the beds and the bathroom, I bumped my arm like four times), you get four star quality. The rooms are nice and clean. Pity though that the elevator does not go up to every floor. We had to take 81 steps to get to our room, not so comfortable carrying our suitcases. But don't get me wrong: you get value for your money because the rates are pretty low here for London standards. ",4,2016,08,30
103,Outstanding stomper service,"I booked a short break for my girlfriend's birthday. I was given a warm welcome by staff who accommodated our every need throughout our stay. Due to a complication with our deluxe double room, we were upgraded to the club suite without charge & received a a range of free products to compensate.

In the 'special requests' section I asked for the, to add any extra special touches for the occasion. They left a delicious slice of cake which was beautifully presented with an array of flowers.

Although the rooms are small, they are extremely well furnished & the hotel is in a great location. Amazing experience!",5,2016,08,29
103,Really Looked After Us,"After 15 hours of travelling overnight & the airline losing our luggage, the staff at park grand really were our silver lining. Upgrading us to another room so we could check in at 8am to shower, supplying us with toiletries, etc. 

The room was a little small but comfortable, the service was exceptional  & has a family feel to it. Location is great, 5 min walk from 2 x tube stations & Hyde Park.

Would stay again,",5,2016,08,25
103,I will definitely use this hotel again,"I stayed 1 night whilst in London with friends. I, myself, had a compact double which although a small room (as its title suggests) was very nicely decorated and very comfortable. The bed was very comfy and as I stayed during the hot weather the air conditioning was very welcome. The only small negative I would mention is that in the bathroom having a trendy large circular sink it left very little room on the cabinet top but that's a personal thing, it looked good but I would have preferred smaller sink and more space on surrounding area. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The closeness to Paddington station was very handy. We all agreed that we will definitely check availability at this hotel next time we come to London.",4,2016,08,24
103,Great base for family trip,"The hotel looks lovely and immaculate from the outside with a beautiful display of flowers which made a very positive impression straight away. We arrived slightly early but were shown to our room immediately and discovered that we had been upgraded from a triple room to a quad with two double beds. This got our trip off to an excellent start especially since the room was immaculate and fairly spacious for London. 

The beds were extremely comfortable and the air conditioning was both effective and quiet which was great as it was very hot whilst we were there and we've had many a night in other hotels where the air con was too noisy to have on at night.  Although the hotel is near a road junction there was very little road noise in the room.  Unfortunately we were disturbed into the early hours by inconsiderate neighbours but after that we all slept very well.  The only downside to the room was that there is not a lot of surface storage space in the bathroom so we couldn't leave toiletries out.  But that is really a small thing given the overall quality of the room.

Breakfast was buffet style with a reasonable selection and something for everyone.  The hot  food was regularly replenished and so was always fresh.  The staff in the restaurant were polite and relatively efficient but there was no enthusiasm and I don't think we saw a smile on either morning. That was a marked contrast with the reception staff who were always smiling, friendly and eager to help.

The location of the hotel is great, it is a 10 minute walk from both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations and there are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area to suit most tastes.  It is also close to Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens which is a pleasant antidote from  the hustle and bustle. 

We would definitely stay at the hotel again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.",4,2016,08,24
103,Friendly staff.,"We stayed in this hotel with my son. We hadn't originally booked this hotel but due to some repairs going on we were put in this hotel. As for this they offered us free breakfast during info out stay. The breakfast buffet was good. Even had Nutella for my son 😀👏🏻 First night we were put in a very small room across the street. The room with the double bed and entrance and bathroom were all divided by a fire door which made me claustrophobic. But when I talked to the duty manager in the morning they kindly moved is to a normal room in the main building. They were ever so kind and polite. Always friendly. 
Many thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2016,08,23
103,Good for a short stay,"We stayed here for 4 nights, We were put in a Room with a kitchenette across the road from Reception, I wasn't sure if it is a different hotel or not but they said they have 3 buildings. 
The room is nice,modern and a good size and the kitchenette was a nice extra. The only problem is that the bed is quite small and me and my wife are a bit smaller than the average people.
The room was on the main road but we didn't hear any noise during the night.
We didn't eat here breakfast and didn't require any assistance from the staff so I can't comment about this.
All in all we had a pleasant stay.",4,2016,08,23
103,An expensive very average stay,"We were put in a Club Room across the road from Reception, which was fine. However, the room smelt of cigarettes and being right near the front door, we heard the door banging loudly throughout the night. 
We had a duvet that was too small for the bed. 
The breakfast room was in a basement area. Our coffee cups were not clean and the wall was spattered with either old coffee stains or food.  
The decor of the room was good with modern features. 
The staff was helpful at check in. 
A good lamb beryani was served in a very strange bar room.",3,2016,08,21
103,Always good to be back to the Park Grand Paddington Court,"Each time I go to London I choose where to stay from a shortlist of hotels that have never disappointed me. Last time I booked a room the Park Grand Paddington Court: since my first stay here years ago, the hotel has changed names and owners, but the quality of the service is always excellent. 
The hotel – one of a series of four of five in London – is in Devonshire Terrace, a quiet residential street close to both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations (under five minutes walking). 
Some rooms are in the main building, whereas others are in the building across the street. We were assigned to a Club Room in the building opposite the reception: the style is similar to the standard rooms where I stayed in the past, so the difference is mainly in the size, with the Club being much bigger than a regular room.
There was a big bed with different kinds of pillow to choose from; a large area with a wardrobe and a desk plus armchairs; a small terrace which we didn’t get to use. The décor is modern, and the room – as the rest of the hotel – was very clean and fashionable. The bathroom was big enough, looking new and with all the things you might need, from towels to hairdryer to toiletries.
Breakfast was served in the main building, next door to the gym available to guests free of charge. Our rate was room only because we wanted to have breakfast in some cafés in Notting Hill: nonetheless, we asked whether it would be possible have breakfast there on our departure day, which was done with an extra 10 £ per person.
Wi-Fi is free of charge and is available in the rooms and in the common areas. 
I totally recommend this hotel to people wanting good quality at a reasonable price.",4,2016,08,19
103,Good Hotel w/ Tiny Rooms,"I thing the title says it all. It's a good hotel (friendly staff, clean rooms and good location) but the rooms were tiny.

I booked 2 rooms, one for my wife and I and the other for the kids. Both were tiny, squeezed and compact rooms. I mean it, really tiny especially for those who used to stay at hotels with large and cozy rooms (like me).

Everything else was good. We stayed a week and never had any problems.

The location is the best thing with this hotel. Everything within a walking distance i.e. shops, restaurants, metro stations and more. Paddington stations takes you everywhere (almost).

Staff are friendly and want to help, but I felt they are understaffed at the concierge. 

Another odd thing with this hotel is the too many (confusing) stairs! Luckily our rooms didn't need many stairs to reach but once I wanted to use the stairs instead of the left and was about to get lost. It's like a maze game (sorry for the example but I really felt so).

One last thing, my booking entitled me for a late check-out but they didn't accept. This is something I will tackle with Booking.com where I made my booking.

Finally, would I recommend it to friends?! Well if you have no issues with tiny rooms then I would. Otherwise, NO.",3,2016,08,18
103,WEEKEND AWAY,"Just back from a long weekend in London staying at the Park Grand.  Its true that the rooms are on the small side but they are clean, modern and very comfortable and it makes a great base for sightseeing etc.  Staff were polite and welcoming what more can you ask for.",4,2016,08,18
103,Great place to base yourself for a London holiday.,"The Park Grand is a great location from which to visit all the London tourist attractions.  The staff are attentive, helpful and efficient.  The rooms are well appointed, beds comfortable, great towels and very good internet.  We visit London regularly and always stay at the Park Grand.  It is a quiet location with some great restaurants and pubs a short walk from the hotel.  We highly recommend the Park Grand.",5,2016,08,17
103,My wife and I in London,"Very good location, nice room and equally important: as advertised except that we were in a building across the street. Not that it mattered, but it was a bit of a surprise.

Extremely friendly, nice and service minded staff.

Outstanding breakfast, well worth money spent.",4,2016,08,16
103,We have just returned from 3 days in this hotel,"Perfect location and perfect hotel , nice to see the staff going the extra mile , we have used this hotel twice this year and will be using it again when returning to London , any one wanting a first class hotel with nice staff and a good location than I would definitely give this hotel 10/10 ",5,2016,08,14
103,Excellent one night stay,"We stayed one night while visiting London. The hotel is near to Paddington station and Hyde Park both 5 minutes away ( in opposite directions) .

But don't be confused as there is another hotel called Hotel Paddington in very close proximity. 

On arrival at reception we met staff who were very welcoming and polite. 

The porter helped us to our room and explained the facilities in the room very well including the air con and underfloor heating in the bathroom and the complimentary phone to use during our stay to make free calls . Had we wished we could have taken the phone with us when we explored London.

Our room was a club room which was in the basement. Our room was very clean and comfortable. There was no view but that was not a problem to us as we spent very little time in the room .The room was compact the only thing missing we would say was a comfortable chair to sit in  should one wish to spend any length of time in there. 

Once we were checked in Alex at reception asked where we would be going and what help and advice he could give us. Alex printed off directions and instructions to get to our destination. 

We had breakfast which was very good . This was buffet style and the food was replenished 

We would recommend this hotel .

103,"Loved it, didn't want to leave! ","I booked this hotel last minute as I wanted to take my daughter for her first visit to london. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted pleasantly by the staff. Check-in took moments and we were shown to our room by Nico who gave us a little information about the room before leaving us alone. The room was beautiful spotlessly clean and with complimentary tea and coffee and biscuits, wine, fruit, water and also soft drink in the little fridge. Waterfall shower and underfloor heating in the bathroom. Each room also comes with its own mobile phone that you can take out and about with you! Just a few minutes walk from Hyde Park and around 45 mins-1hr walk to the palace or there are tube and train stations very nearby if you don't feel like walking. 

Myself and my little girl will definitely be returning to this hotel we loved our stay. 
Thank-you.",5,2016,08,14
103,Relocated,"I originally booked to stay at the sister hotel Park Grand Kensington, however due to maintenence issues, was relocated to this hotel.

Although location wise this was slightly inconvenient, the hotel was lovely. Very clean and tidy and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Everything I needed, they were there with a speedy solution. One member of staff also remembered my breakfast order after the first day and I was offered it immediately upon arrival for breakfast every other morning of my stay.

I would definitely choose to stay here again.  ",5,2016,08,13
103,Sandra & Ken review,We had a great experience at Grand Park Paddington. We booked a mini Suite and appreciated the cleanliness and size of our room and the air conditioning during the warm weather. On 3 occasions we called the desk with requests and the staff responded each time within minutes. The location is excellent for visitors since it is just down the road from Paddington Station and a quick walk to Lancaster Gate tube and bus stops. We would definitely consider booking here again next trip to London.,4,2016,08,12
103,A really good place,"This is one of the best places to stay. Looks like it has recently been refurbished and the room standard is very good. Compared to many of the hotels I have stayed in in London tis is one of the best. I mistakenly booked a single room so i cannot really complain. It was a little tight but the standard made up for it. Even underfloor heating in the bathroom. The room was in the basement with no view so that was a little disappointment but hey who stays in their room.
There was a little issue of  a flood in the bar area so could not eat there and was shown to their sister hotel a minutes walk away. Same menu. Whilst it was a simple menu it was cooked perfect. Also not too expensive which was great. Draught beer in the bar would help a lot. There were lots of staff and everyone had a smile and was helpful. Breakfast, a great selection of hot and cold and all very good quality. Recommended.",5,2016,08,12
103,The best hotel I had stayed at during my years in London (9 times past 5 years),"Very nice staff, helpful and efficient. The rooms were great, the bathroom as well . The breakfast was top also. The location did make it easy to travel around in London. Not far away from Paddington, Queensway or Bayswater. Fine restaurants and small shops nearby.",5,2016,08,11
103,Third Year at the Park Grand Paddington Court,"Dear Sara
Thank you for everything you did to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable. As you know it was my third year at the Park Grand Paddington Court and I will definitely be back. Thank you also to all your very helpful staff, at the front desk, at the door and at the bar! :)
All the best Sara and see you next year or possibly sooner!",4,2016,08,08
103,Best stay for a long time,"Warm welcome, staff efficient and helpful.
Nice, comfortable, and clean room.
Good location, Heathrow express and tube.
Tasty light dinner.
Close to restaurants. The staff recommendations were good.
All together, highly recommended!",5,2016,08,07
103,Great for a short stay,"We only had one night, but the hotel is clean and central to what we had to do in London.
We had a first floor room, so no lift but the staff assisted us.
The hotel had been renovated recently and very comfortable.
We didn't have any food or drink but there is a bar and breakfast is available for 15 quid.
We arrived early and luggage storage is available.
Staff were very friendly.
",4,2016,08,06
103,Top rate hotel,What a pleasure it was staying at this hotel clean very comfortable staff exceptionally polite and helpful close to tube station enjoyed so much going back in September the breakfast was excellent special mention for the club rooms worth the upgrade,5,2016,08,05
103,A very comfortable stay !!,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights (compact double room). Yes the room is small, as expected but it was still quite comfortable for us and was very clean. There are several shops and restaurants nearby which was very convenient. The location was awesome - very close to Paddington station and an easy walking distance from the Big Bus Tour stop as well. Overall had a very pleasant stay at this hotel.",5,2016,08,05
103,Decent but a few flaws,"I stayed in a deluxe double room which was very compact but I guess that's London. 

Fridge and microwave and cutlery so could have some food in the room.

Bed was small but comfortable enough, nice but compact bathroom. The air conditioning even on low was gale force winds level which meant I was either freezing or boiling. I was very sick during my stay and this did not help me to improve.

There was a questionable stain on the bedhead which well it looked like the aftermath of a couple's night of fun if you know what I mean .... 

Service was impeccable. They sent extra tissues and tea over for me without asking. Although housekeeping could not speak English she was lovely and efficient.

I am unsure if I would stay again but I wasn't unhappy staying here. My idea of 4 star is a bit different to this I guess.",3,2016,08,05
103,Great Value,"This small hotel has a great staff.  Very cheerful, helpful, welcoming. Good location.  I had a small single room that was clean and well-appointed.  How about this:  in the room there is a fully-loaded mobile phone for use so long as you are registered.  Want to call home to Los Angeles while at Covent Gardens? No worries.  Want to check your email while resting in a bench in Hyde Park?  Go for it!  When in the hotel you can use your own device because there is free wifi.  If you book directly, the breakfast is free.  Fastidious about the shower, as I am?   It has sliding glass doors (as I do at home, a real luxury) and both a rain forrest and hand-held device.  Really, at the low price, what more do you want?  Stay there is my recommendation.  I have been traveling all my life so I don't say that lightly.",5,2016,08,04
103,Clean Lovely Place,"A.Offers a free cell phone to use while you are there - ""travelling buddy"". where you can, among other things

c. front Desk staff very helpful- my messages were collected, typed and delivered to my room
d. fruits in the lobby
4. good breakfast",5,2016,08,04
103,Great hotel and lovely staff,"I stayed at this hotel with a colleague for 5 days whilst working at the courts in the strand . The hotel staff could not have been more helpful , from the lovely boys at the door and in reception where nothing was too much trouble ! To the restaurant staff at breakfast who even remembered that we had decaf tea and coffee each morning !! 
The reception staff were brilliant sorting out our transport each day and always smiling and polite . The only slight negative for me was the size of my room , it was very small but the cleanliness and high standard of bed and linen compensated for that .  Last but not least we ate in bar a couple of times and food was superb and very reasonable . Definitely recommend this hotel .",5,2016,07,30
103,Hmm..,"When upon arrival the porter told us he would be leading us to our rooms in the basement, I asked whether there would be any windows, which is very important to me. He said ""well, yes of course. Good thing is the rooms in the basement are much bigger than the other ones!"". When both my cvolleague and I arrived to our rooms, we really wondered what the rest of the rooms looked like! I have never stayed in smaller rooms, and we both kept bumping into furniture on our way in and out. Mind you, the bathroom was spacious enough. I didnt mind the size of the rooms so much as the smell in the corridors which I couldnt quite figure out. I only had breakfast once, only having my usual toast, but the rest looked ok. The girl at checkout was really polite and helpful as were the porters and all the staff I encountered in the corridors. The location isnt bad, you have to walk for approximately 6 minutes to get to the Paddington train station. For those interested in a good night's sleep, the beds are not the most comfortable I have slept it.",3,2016,07,29
103,Top notch customer service,"Problems with the AC led the hotel to change our room - without a hitch or problem on their part. They apologized, left us a fruit plate, offered a bottle of wine, and was ever so gallant in taking care of us. The smoothness of the hotel staff makes it clear they are trained well in customer service. The rooms, albeit small as are most hotel rooms in London, are very clean and well taken care of. Location is perfect - a short 5 minute walk from  Paddington Station and from Hyde Park, and in a quiet area add to the charm. Breakfast is also a good value, with immaculate service from the staff working in the restaurant. Plenty of staff present at the front desk or at the front door to take care of your needs. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks for a great few days in London",5,2016,07,27
103,Lovely stay ,"Great hotel with helpful friendly staff. Stayed in a triple room for 2 nights. Location is brilliant and close to Paddington station.
Spotlessly clean and comfy well decorated rooms. 
complimentary drinks, fruit and wine- Lovely touches. 
Also a complimentary phone to use for the stay and we were able
To take it out for Google maps- free uk phone calls and unlimited internet.

Breakfast was lovely too 
Would definitely recommend this hotel
And stay there again myself. ",5,2016,07,26
103,Nearly like at home!,"Rooms are modern but in an old building and somehow limited in size. Said this, everything else was very good and confortable. It was the first time I had a smartphone as free gadget with the room, that we took in our daily wanderings. And great service from the reception staff like Roberta, Erika and the other colleagues, (¡Muchas gracias Roberta!). Having Hyde Park at a short stroll and subway stations from several lines nearby (not to mention Paddington), also add to the confort in this hotel.",5,2016,07,26
103,A New Hope,"We understand that this hotel was recently renovated, and it really shows.  Comfortable beds (twins were a tad narrow, but acceptable).  Clean rooms with a great shower and fabulous air conditioning.  Excellent service. The staff went out of their way to be polite, helpful, and accommodating.  It is clear that they are being well trained and managed.  Food was excellent with a variety of items typical of a British breakfast.  Staying here was a pleasant experience.  It is fairly close to Paddington Station and Underground, which made it a nice place to launch our daily forays into the city.",5,2016,07,26

acsess across town
Very Good servise - Alex from the front desk gave us grate support",5,2016,07,26
103,A great stay!,"This is a lovely hotel, the exterior and architecture are very much interesting. It is more like a maze when you try to walk into the rooms, the hallways are tight and only one person can pass by at a time. 
My husband was worried about the space , however I kept rooting for the place because it has an A star location. Very close to Hyde park, a few minute walk to the most famous station (Paddington) and a handful of restaurants and pubs around.
As my husband expected , the room was too small although we had booked a club deluxe ; however we called the reception and they were glad to show us other rooms and moved to a bigger room that fell under the same category. the beds were a bit uncomfortable but we slept through after the long days of walking and touring around.
The staff are very friendly , helpful and always smiling. I would definitely stay there again!",4,2016,07,25
103,Our stay in the hotel was a treat,"Our stay in Park Grand Paddington Court was a treat.
We particularly appreciated the personnel's dedication.
Breakfast was sumptuous.
The room was cosy and welcoming. Everything seems to have been thought through.",5,2016,07,25
103,Nice place very close to Paddington ,"Nice place. The room was small but that was expected. The bathroom was clean but had a design problem where the toilet seat blocks the entry to the shower area. Staff are very friendly. Had a nice TV. The common lobby area in the first floor always had some distinctive foul smell but that didn't affect the experience inside the room. 

Would be an even better place if the lobby area smelled better and if the bathroom was better designed. ",5,2016,07,24
103,Very nice hotel,"Great location - just by Paddington station.
Stayed in a Club room, wich is larger than a standard room, and it was OK.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
Room was comfortable and clean.
Quiet room, even tough we were just by an elevator. No outside noise at all.
Good free WIFI.",5,2016,07,23
103,"Good location, spatially challenged rooms","Helpful staff, the room was a little tight (both of them, due to the kids being in the room next door). Perhaps a little overpriced for what you get. But this is London afterall. Decent breakfast. We stayed two nights and had easy access to Padington station / tube.",3,2016,07,22
103,"Tiny, Strange, but Acceptable","The rooms are tiny, somewhat like a business hotel in Japan.  They seem nice enough inside, but with some minor problems and inconveniences.

From the street view, the hotel appears to be made out of what used to be several adjacent row houses.  The hotel has a labyrinthian character, with many short hallways and staircases with no discernible pattern.  The strange layout can make it challenging to find a room.  Some rooms are not accessible via the elevator due to stairs.  The floor of my room was noticeably sloped at one edge, as if it spanned the area between two row houses.  

The interior is not well kept.  For example, each time I pushed through a fire door, my hand felt stickiness.  The sink trap in the bathroom had a leak that the hotel could not fix; because towels are stored beneath the sink, the towels always had a damp yellow stain on it, requiring my wife to ask for new towels every evening.  Except for the plumbing problem the room seemed clean though tiny by US standards.

One possibly nice thing is that the hotel offers a free mobile smart phone for use during your stay.  This could be helpful for accessing maps to get around town, or for making and receiving telephone calls during your stay.  The terms of service were so long and complicated that I just used my own iPhone; therefore, I can't say how useful this free service could be.  It made a nice night light in the room.

On floor -1 this hotel has a breakfast restaurant that opens at 7 AM.  It serves a full English breakfast that is fairly hearty.  The price for breakfast is quite high: about £17, which is quite a bit more than the price of breakfast at nearby restaurants.

The hotel staff seems friendly and helpful.

There is a bike sharing stand in front of the hotel.  The hotel is about 1/4 mile walk from two tube stations.  A convenience store, some restaurants, and a Barclays ATM are within walking distance.",3,2016,07,22
103,good location,"Very good location with 10 min walk to paddington or lancaster tube station.
Old building which has been newly renovated and some rooms are very small (12m2) while other are bigger. At check-in we received the small room, but the following day we requested for a bigger room and the request was meet and we received a room about 20m2 without extra charges. Very nice:)
Night staff is a young (indian) team and they could be more service minded.",4,2016,07,22
103,Decent no frills place,"Rooms are clean and spacious enough. Stayed in a double bed room on the ground floor during one of the hottest July's and the windows were painted shut! 

The place is a bit if a maze.  I have stayed in the main building but have also been taken out and directed to a building half way up the street.  They must own several buildings on the street and have converted them. 

Biggest draw is free WiFi in rooms.  When I first stayed their Internet was around 40mb but since it averages out around 4 to 5 mb. ",3,2016,07,20
103,Very nice,"Staff were very welcoming, and my partner had told them it was my birthday and the staff had wrote me a lovely card and also placed a piece of birthday cake on the bed. I thought it was an extremely thoughtful gesture.

The property was perfectly placed and it was a lovely walk through the park.

Stayed in a fair few hotels in London but for a good nights sleep in comfort, I would most certainly recommend staying here.",5,2016,07,20
103,Rooms are too small,"The reception is smart and staff are professional and friendly. There's no lounge to relax in. Although the staff tried their best to cater for gluten free at breakfast the food was of poor quality. 
The rooms are insanely small! The bed is not a double. I'm not sure how their legally getting away with the size.",2,2016,07,20
103,Compact double ,"We only stayed for one night in a compact double 
The room was really small which was fine but the bed was ridiculous . I hardly slept - this bed is not suited to more than one person . My husband is 6ft 2 and slim and I'm 5ft 2 and small too - prob a 3/4 bed 
Apart from that - the hotel was spot on and great location ",4,2016,07,16

We had a clunker AirBnB that we could not tolerate ... after tramping around for something affordable ... we finally landed at Park Grand Paddington Court.   The staff were exceptional in getting us into comfortable rooms, quickly and at a decent price.  Original accommodations were good for the first night ... the day manager Lisette and the night manager Michael outdid themselves to get us into the perfect rooms.

The double and triple rooms across the street are nicely decorated and look out over a quiet, typical London street.   Only a few minutes walk from nearby train lines, Kensington gardens and Paddington station.",4,2016,07,15
103,Europe 2016,"Spent five nights here, hotel clean, convenient and for a London hotel reasonably large. Comfortable bed, we got a deal at an extremely good rate and included breakfast, Paddington is well serviced by underground buses and some good pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Happy to return to hotel and general area.",4,2016,07,15
103,Very nice weekend stay!,"My girlfriend & I booked this hotel for 2 nights over a weekend as we were attending a concert at Hyde Park and had read that Park Grand Paddington was nearby. The hotel is literally a stones throw away from the park. 
The hotel is very clean with a really modern reception & rooms. We were in a club room which had all amenities; fridge, microwave, tv, tea & coffee facilities etc. The bathroom was also very nice with a big rainforest shower, toilet, sink & shaving kit, dental kit, shower cap etc. Also free wifi throughout.
We were greeted with a complimentary (small) bottle of red wine & a plate of fresh fruit in the room which was a nice touch. There are also soft drinks & water in the fridge. 
The area around the hotel is really good, few good pubs nearby (the mitre, the swan) and a really nice cocktail bar (under the mitre pub) called Old Mary's. 
The nearest tube station is Paddington on the Bakerloo (brown) line, this is around 5 mins away, past a good pub called The Pride of Paddington which do a really good breakfast! 
You can walk down to Bayswater station which is a bit further but has some really nice restaurants in the area. 

All in all a very nice stay with very pleasant staff. Definitely recommend to friends.",4,2016,07,14
103,Good Quality,"I constantly hear the comments of London hotel rooms being 'small'.  Most hotel rooms are, unless you pay £500 per night at the Ritz, you are going to be in a small room, but I don't stay there all day, it's just a night-time thing! 
The Park Grand is centrally situated for Lancaster Gate tube, about 10 mins walk at leisurely pace (and if you can get past the Swan pub!) Also central for events in Hyde Park.  We used this hotel to go to the Hampton Court Flower show, a journey by tube to Waterloo then surface train to Hampton Court, just over an hour and you can use your Oyster card.
For the hotel: friendly and efficient staff welcome you and quickly you are booked into your rooms, the higher floors served by lifts. The rooms are clean, the bed one of the most comfortable I have slept in, just one observation, there was little room in the bathroom for toiletries. 
Breakfast was a good quality, for those who want English breakfast (and who wouldn't ?) fried tomatoes, bacon, sausage, scrambled egg, baked beans, and if you wanted fried or poached eggs, just ask the staff. 

Plenty of restaurants around catering for differing tastes, The Mitre pub just down the road, and for those who want a 'Boris' bicycle, there is a rack of them just outside.

I will certainly return to this hotel",4,2016,07,13
103,"Compact, but comfortable. Great location","I stayed here for an overnight as I passed through London on my way to Scotland.  The location is very good - only 3 minutes from Paddington Station and lots of good restaurant and pubs in the vicinity too.  

The room was very compact which was fine for me as a solo traveller - if there was another person there, and more luggage it would have been uncomfortable.",4,2016,07,13
103,"Nice Hotel, VERY small rooms","Stayed here for one night in room 123. We arrived on Sunday afternoon around 3 and reception was very busy, we had to wait a while to check in.  When we did get checked in we were shown across the road by a porter to a room which was still being cleaned.  The staff very quickly resolved the situation by showing us to another room in the main building. 

The hotel is modern with stylish furniture and very clean, including the rooms.  However, the main problem we had was the size of the room and bed.  The room was very small and the bed was a three quarter size at best, and pressed against the wall so only accessible from one side, not what you'd except from a deluxe double room.  It was almost impossible for two people to move in the room at the same time and there was nowhere to put anything down, only one bedside cabinet.

Although the hotel is in a good location for underground (Paddington or Lancaster Gate) and good for Hyde Park, and also nicely furnished, we would not go back to this hotel due to the room issue.",3,2016,07,11
103,"Lovely property, with a great location","I am posting this on behalf of my dad, who stayed here. This hotel is located right around the corner of it's sister property 'Park Grand Lancaster Gate'. The rooms were nice and plush (he had booked a club room). It's almost identical to the rooms at the other Park Grand, which is a good thing.

The staff was friendly and always there to assist you. It seems both the properties have chosen their staff with great care and attention, which makes for a great stay.

It's located close to both, Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations, and Hyde park is a couple of minutes walk away. It aslo has plenty of small restaurants, pubs and convenience stores around it.

All in all, it's a great alternative to the Park Grand Lancaster Gate, which can only be a good thing!",5,2016,07,11
103,Great comfortable room,"We booked a Club Double room for one night stay. we wanted to be stay near Hyde park to go see Stevie Wonder. This hotel is a brilliant central location for all your needs . Paddington station literally a few minutes walk away, Hyde park walkable but we were lazy & jumped in a cab which cost £6. 
The room are very well equipped with tea & coffee making facilities and the bed is lush. A great night sleep was had. The shower room although teeny tiny is fitted with high end fittings and does the job perfectly. Lets touch on the lighting in the room, my  friend and I were in hestrical laughter at 2 in the morning, as between us we could work out to turn off the blooming lights... half an hour later, still no joy. An embarrassed call to reception sorted our little hiccup but technology at this time of the day just wast our thing. A simple light switch or instructions would put a simple task to bed a lot quicker , just a thought ...

Theres a complementary mobile phone for use , although I couldn't get it to connect to the internet or make a call home, which seemed pointless. 
All in all a lovey room.",5,2016,07,11
103,Great London hotel location!!,"We were originally booked to stay at a sister property down the street. When we arrived there had been a maintenance issue resulting in no hot water. As a result they moved us to Paddington Court Suites. They upgraded our room and gave us free breakfast for the week. We could not have asked for better service! It is a great boutique hotel. Each room has its own separate little hallway entry. The Jr Suite easily accommodated myself and my two adult children. It was like a small apartment.  We had a kitchenette and a newly refurbished bathroom. Spacious and very clean!  They had Complimenty smart phone which allowed us free internet and phone service as we toured around the city. The daily breakfast buffet offered us the full English breakfast and was quite filling. Great customer service and all the staff spoke several languages. Concierge helped us with restaurant recommendations, reservations for high tea, and transportation at very good negotiated rates. The location was very close to Hyde Park and very convenient to two Tube stations ( Paddington as well as Lancaster Garden) would certainly recommend this hotel to friends!",4,2016,07,11
103,Tiny room & poor check in experience,"We booked here via booking.com. Granted on a busy weekend in London the price for the room was competitive in a very good location, but there was definite room for improvement. I found the check in experience to be inefficient, slow and tedious. Having I paid in full for the room in advance, it could be more streamlined and did not need to be so intrusive (e.g being asked for photo ID and an imprint of my credit card).

We were shown to our room across the road in a ""suite"" building (not the main hotel). The room was on a basement level accessed by lift or a very steep staircase. It was tiny for a double with very little natural light. The room was stuffy and too hot on arrival so noisy air con had to be on all the time in the room and overnight. My 6'4ins husband (1.93m) could not fit into the shower. The concierge who showed us to the room could see our dismay at the size. Given the disappointing check in experience we did not feel that complaining at reception or asking to be moved was worth our time. Alex on checkout was understanding and offered a room upgrade for a future stay. I'm not convinced we would book here again but given the location, it may be worth a try.",3,2016,07,11
103,nice rooms with a dashing Bar,"Well it was not the best experience I have regarding the staff service because there was a person having a name tag  something like Mr Desman was realy standing with upset mode and he made me sad as well by giving some order to follow the steps to check in. I asked him a couple of questions and he said you have to check in then i will answer your questions. the silly thing is he did  not respond well and i had to came to down next day to get the right information from a another colleague. 
Hotel was nice and pretty much best location for business trips.",4,2016,07,11
103,Birthday Weekend !!!,"I'd originally booked to stay in the Grand Royale, but when we arrived, there wasn't any rooms, due to Hotel refurbishments..........the Reception advised my booking had been transferred to their sister Hotel, the Grand Park......we were taken there, very promptly........
We checked in.....the rooms we had, were lovely, extremely comfortable beds, lovely thick towels in the bathroom, all the usual amenities in the room.........and Breakfast was very good, everything you could want !!! We had Lunch, in the Bar, also very good !! It's a very bright, light Hotel, in a quiet street, modernised, in an old building...

The Concierge Desk/Reception arranged all our taxi bookings, to where we wanted to go, advice on Restaurants, close by for dinner, booked us a table, at a lovely Italian Restaurant.......As I was treating my friend Anne to the weekend, for her 80th Birthday.........

The Hotel Staff, were so helpful, always smiling !!  So helped me to give this very special friend, a wonderful Memory....As, I didn't want to give her just a wrapped up present.......So now  we both have a Memory that we will treasure forever !!!

So I really, really recommend staying here........The Staff, is this Hotel's ""Secret Weapon"".........and you can't put a price on their commitment to ensuring you have a Wonderful Stay..........Many Thanks to you all !!!",5,2016,07,10
103,Fantastic Boutique Hotel in Paddingtom,"The Park Grand Paddington Court is clean, modern boutique-style hotel conveniently located in Paddington. It is only a few minutes from a number of underground stations including Paddington and Lancaster Gate. It's also a short walk to Hyde Park and you can even reach Harrod's if you want to go a little longer. The staff were friendly and unfailingly helpful no matter what situation arose. Only minor criticism would be the lack of a power point in the bathroom for your hairdryer and limited space around the handbasins for your bits and pieces. Definitely take a deluxe room or higher as the standard may be just a little too small for comfort.",4,2016,07,10
103,Excellent value,"The hotel was excellent value for money. All the staff were of a high standard and the cleanliness of the hotel was of the highest order. Excellent location for Paddington railway station, approx. 10 minutes walk, as we were taking an early morning flight.",5,2016,07,07
103,Good location but will not revisit,"Booked deluxe double and was disappointed the room is really small compared to other hotels in London I've stayed in the past. It's different from photos I've seen online as well. The bed size is smaller than queen to sleep 2 people. Room walls are thin and you can hear almost every conversation happening outside the room. Corridor outside room is narrow and comfortable for only 1 person to walk at a time. In-room wifi is weak. Connection is intermittent and sometimes unable to logon.

The upside of this hotel is it's location. It's about 8 minutes walk to Paddington station and Lancaster Gate station. Room is considered clean.",2,2016,07,07
103,Great location,"Firstly, the location is excellent for visiting London. Easy walk through Hyde Park to central London and everything it has to offer. Paddington station is a couple of blocks away so the tube & rail system are easy to access. The staff are wonderful & very helpful. The hotel rooms are tastefully decorated with a modern bathroom. Large wall mounted LED TV. But, the rooms are very small, I'm not talking shoe box I'm talking match box. We stayed for 3 nights, fortunately we spent very little time in the room.  Breakfast is very good but as others have said the breakfast room is also small so you may have to wait. ",4,2016,07,06
103,fantastic staff,"Just returned from one night at this hotel with my son. We went for a concert in Hyde Park ( Carole King and Don Henley--BRILLIANT !!)
When we got to our room it hadn't been prepared so went back to reception to ask for a different room which was ready for occupation. There had been a glitch in the new computer system ( we all know about these !) and the room was showing as incorrectly being ready. The lovely lady in charge of reception changed our room and as an apology added complementary full breakfast for myself and my son. I hadn't expected this. We went to the concert and on our return she informed us that she had arranged for a small bottle of wine and fruit to be placed in our room. The room was lovely, beds really comfortable and the service at the hotel from reception and the porters was amazing. Would definitely advise everyone to book as the welcome was so warm and friendly. Thank you lovely lady !!",5,2016,07,04
103,Small rooms but new,"The room was small but overall pretty decent. It was very clean and everything seemed to be pretty new and in good condition. The hotel service was friendly.

The only issue we had was that the day before our reservation, we got a cryptic email saying our credit card information was encrypted and we needed to supply another credit card or our reservation would be cancelled. This seems like poor service to me especially since we were travelling around. What if by chance we didn't have Internet access and didn't see this email? Or what if we didn't have phone access to call them? We would've shown up and found out that our reservation was cancelled.

Other than that, we were happy with the stay itself and they are more reasonably priced than other hotels in London. We would consider staying with them again.",4,2016,07,04
103,Small and not so clean.,"The location was in a pretty quiet side of London with small stores very close by. 
The tube stations were about a 5 min or so walking distance.

The rooms and beds were way too small compared to the pictures on the website and the rooms weren't so clean at all. We stayed here for 5 days and they didn't really clean the rooms very well either.

It was my first time in London and If I had known, I wish we could've stayed in a much better cleaner comfortable place.

Quite dissatisfied.",2,2016,07,03
103,9 Nights in London,"My wife, 2 daughters (16 & 12) and I recently returned from a 9 night stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court.  Our original booking (via American Airlines Vacations) was for (2) deluxe double rooms but at some point I decided what I would've preferred was (1) deluxe double and one deluxe twin and if connecting rooms were possible even better.  With that in mind I contacted the hotel directly via email and through a number of communications got the arrangement I was hoping for (I had to pay for an upgrade to one of the rooms).

Upon our arrival at the hotel around 10 AM I was greeted by Lisete, the Duty Manager with whom I was communicating with.  She had been a great help leading up to our arrival so I was happy to finally meet her.  One of our rooms was available so we were able to drop off our bags and freshen up after a long trip.  As promised, we had connecting deluxe double and deluxe twin rooms (102 & 103) which were sharing a small alcove with 104 and an elevator.  It was almost as if we had our own suite.  We were pleased with the location and the accommodations.  The rooms were clean, nicely appointed albeit small which was expected.  The bath was also compact, clean and was sufficient.  The only negative to the room was that we had some difficulty with the outlets.  The US outlet didn't work in one of our rooms, the USB port seemed to be inconsistent when it worked.  We had (2) UK adaptors and one international adaptor so we made out OK charging phones, tablets, Fitbits, cell battery backups & camera batteries with a little juggling.  It would have also been nice to have an outlet or USB port at each nightstand so if you wanted you phone charging at your bedside you could.  Again, not a big detractor and we managed just fine.

One nice feature they had was called Handy.  It's an Android based handheld that you can take with you around the city.  With it you can access the internet, maps, etc. and also use it to make local calls.  This device along with the CityMapper app were really helpful and allowed me to minimize use of my own cell which I had a travel plan.

The daily breakfast was fine.  We never had any problems finding something to eat and never left hungry.  The staff throughout the hotel were friendly and accommodating.

The location was good as we were 4 blocks from Paddington Station which gave us easy access to the District, Hammersmith & City, Circle & Bakerloo lines as well as the Heathrow Express and trains to Windsor.  It was also a short walk to the Lancaster Gate station for the Central line so getting around and out of the city was very easy.

Again, I wanted to single out Lisete for her assistance prior to our arrival.  She was every bit as courteous and pleasant in person as she appeared via email and was a great help.  I would certainly consider staying at the Paddington Court should I find myself traveling to London again.",4,2016,07,03
103,Business stay in London,Note it was quite late when I checked in at around 20.30 but was told that there was a problem with the hot water and so I was moved to the sister hotel which was only circa 50 mrs away. Check-in was quite slow and the room was very small albeit suitably decorated. The cost was nearly £200 and to be fair the on-line site that I used didn't make it clear that the price was net of VAT. Overall OK but I would not rush back ..certainly not for that price!,3,2016,07,03
103,"Great location, staff...Makes your stay in London perfect..","Great location and staff makes your stay perfect.. As usual, the rooms are very small so I advise travelers to London (especially if this was your first time) to try and upgrade your accommodation into more bigger room or even suite. Usually the suite in London is on the size of a normal room elsewhere. 

This hotel is walking distance from Paddington station.. almost 5 min also 4 min to Paddington metro station and around 10 min from Lancaster gate station. 
The staff are superb, room are well equipped too with a very good wi-fi.

I tried several hotels before settling down on this one..and it became my favorite in London.. been in the hotel now for more than 4 time in less than 8 months... 

Highly recommended..",5,2016,07,01
103,Very Nice Hotel,"We stayed here in June for 5 days . We were actually moved to this hotel as there had been a problem with our original booking at there sister hotel in Kensington. At first i wasn't happy with with being moved but we had originally booked room only so for the inconvenience they included breakfast for the five days we were there. 
   This hotel is close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations so getting around was fine. The hotel was very clean throughout , staff were very friendly and breakfast was very good with cooked and continental buffet on offer, although the restaurant was a bit small so depending what time you went for breakfast you may have to wait. The Wifi was free but was a bit erratic and poor in our room.
   Our room again was very clean although bathroom was a bit small. We had a fridge which was handy along with a big flat screen tv . We loved the idea of the complimentary mobile device which we could use for going about London great for google maps etc.
   Would have no hesitation in staying here again in the future.",4,2016,06,29
103,Compact but very modern bathroom and very clean,"I had occasion to travel to London for business.  We decided we wanted to be based near Paddington mainline station as it really suited?

Picking a hotel in this area is difficult as there are many to choose from and a very wide variety of prices.  We picked this hotel for location, nice pictures of the albeit small rooms and a fair price compared to other hotels in the area.

We asked for an early checkin as we were flying overnight and we were accommodated at 7.00am for checkin to both rooms.

Reception staff were very friendly, especially the night team who worked from 8pm to 8am, 6 days a week.  Breakfast could be had at a discount if ordered the night before.  Breakfast was very good, staff again were friendly and nice atmosphere in the place.

Bedroom part of the room is tight, great for one but not sure how two would cope shuffling around each other.   Bathroom was also compact but very modern and clean.
Overall, for a short stay, it served its purpose and I do believe I will seriously consider staying there again, if it suited.",3,2016,06,29
103,Small but reasonably well thought out,"I have to admit to being surprised at the size of the single room I was allocated. I know many single hotel rooms in London are small but this still takes me by surprise every time! 

However, in using the room it may have been small but was perfectly formed and had mostly what you need for a business trip. Plenty of power sockets, reliable wifi, good shower and a comfortable bed. A nice touch was the bottled water in the room. The only drawback was there really wasn't enough space to work in the room. Judging by the others working in the small, but very pleasant, lounge this was not an isolated problem. 

Staff were very pleasant and could not have been more helpful. 

Breakfast items were fresh. There could have been a little more choice of fruit but what was on offer was very good. 

Would certainly stay again. 

",4,2016,06,28
103,Booked the Park Grand Paddington Court got the Park Grand Lancaster Gate Hotel,"Well impressed. Booking non corporate chain hotels is always a risk. (I travel a lot with work). So when i was booked here I was skeptical. I checked in like royalty escorted to to my room. OK it was very small but still a double. I had everything to a very high standard. It looked very new and was spotless. I had a quick breakfast, bacon was lush and off to work. I would defiantly stay here again.",5,2016,06,24
103,Fair price. Good location ,You get what you pay for. For the price it is a place to sleep have breakfast and is convenient to many sights in London as well as paddington station and the tube.  The bed is comfortable the washroom small but clean. The room itself is dated but acceptable. We received a welcome gift and upgrade. Overall our stay was fine. ,3,2016,06,24
103,An Excellent experience,"The hotel location is super!
Its is close by to edgware Rd 
The reception of the hotel, especially Ms. SAKINA, has provide an excellent service to us .. she was so helpful and cooperative to ease the checked in for us. Thank you",5,2016,06,24

103,Best hotel in London,"Great location, quiet and friendly neighbourhood. The hotel is very clean, and provide all the services you need. The staff is beyond kind and everyone is ready to help you. The breakfast is really good, although the room is quite small so sometimes you have to queue for a table.
The receptionists are helpful, kind and friendly, I've had the chance to talk to the Portuguese staff, Monica and other two I don't recall the name and they have helped us in all ways possible. Will definitely come back!! ",5,2016,06,23
103,Awesome,"The stay was great with friendly staff and easy access to the city,I will be back again in June,the rooms are very well laid out and nothing is to much for the staff,they make you feel welcome from first foot in the door.Anytime am in London it will be my place to stay.",5,2016,06,23
103,Great place for short break,"Thought we'd book a short London break but with so many places to choose from it's hard to decide, but the Park Grand ticked all the box's for our requirements. on arriving in London it's just a short walk from Paddington station, booking in was very easy, we were greeted by warm friendly staff whom have been very helpful and pleasant though out our stay, although we went out and about London during the day time we did have a fantastic breakfast before going out each morning, if we visit London again in the future we will now find it easy to know where to stay.",5,2016,06,22
103,Great hotel!,The location was great for walking tours of London and Paddington Station for access to Heathrow.  The room was clean and well appointed.  The price was unbelievable for a London hotel!  Will definitely stay here again.,5,2016,06,22
103,Good value but a bit out of the way,"We booked here for a night to go to see the War of the Worlds in April.

Booking in was very easy and the hotel looked nice and modern.  We did get confused as I am sure plenty of others do also as they have a sister hotel with almost the exact same name 100 metres or so up the road and we had to be re-directed.

We went up to our room and it was of a good size with a comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with a very good shower.

We then went out to the West End for dinner and a show, this took a bit of time as we were quite a way from a tube and also then a distance to travel, but to be fair we booked it as I was that part of London for the day with work so that is probably my fault.

The hotel was nice, but I did not like that you had to walk through the bar from reception to get to our room.

We did not have breakfast as it was quite expensive but went into town and grabbed a bite to eat before starting our day.

All in all this is a good priced, clean smart, comfortable hotel and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in that part of town.",4,2016,06,20
103,"Lovely hotel, shame about some of the staff.","We stayed overnight at this hotel and we found check-in very easy and informative and the receptionists were accommodating at all times.
We stayed in a club room which was very modern and comfortable. We had zero view but we didnt mind as just needed something peaceful to lay our head at night!

We went for breakfast which had all different types of food you could want, english, continental and healthier things such as fruit etc. We went at around 830am and it was very busy and cramped and although we did not have to wait when we left we noticed a lot of people queuing so i would get there earlier rather than later!

The only thing that disappointed me about the stay was the staff. Even though they fulfilled their end of the service and did everything they needed to, i felt it was unfriendly and like they did not want to be there. They need to smile more and have a chat with the guests, it was rather robotic, sadly.

Easy to check out and grateful to them for holding our suitcase for the day.",4,2016,06,19
103,Good choice for a short stay,"Very good location, diligent and friendly staff, clean rooms, the hotel offers to its guests a basic smart phone with free 3G internet, so you can use Google Maps and guides pre-installed. I would agree to some comments I have seen about the noise, e.g. I could hear somebody's alarm-clock set for 6:00 am every day, not to say about children crying/laughing. I would avoid LG floor rooms -- although they seem to have all modern amenities, they lack natural lighting, smelly, humidity is very high, which reminds a bit Dickens's books.",4,2016,06,19
103,Mohamed falimban,"Hotel was excellent, the rooms were beatiful and the hotel hostess to checked us in her name Sakina, she is so nice and helpful. She provided us with amazing serviceschecking in and out and answered to all of our requirements she was amazing. I recomend this hotel to any one going to the uk. Ask for Sakina when you get there",5,2016,06,18
103,Very expensive for a very small room,"We stayed for one night. Was very late when we got to the room as we had been to a concert so we were very disappointed to find a very pokey room with a 4foot 6 ins bed. This was pushed right against the wall so that one of us had to climb out to the bottom of the bed to get out during the night. It was clean and bathroom was also clean. The next morning we went down to breakfast to find there was a queue waiting for a table. We waited for about 10 minutes, but breakfast was good. We paid £168 for this room for one night which we felt was very overpriced",2,2016,06,18
103,Great London walking/tube location for families,"Liseth, the duty manager, and her team were amazing. We had 2 rooms for 5 people. Both were available early which was great since we had just arrived from the US on an overnight flight. The accommodations were perfect. Quiet, comfortable bed, in-room coffee/tea. 5 minute walk to Hyde Park or Paddington Station. Great for kids.
Thanks Lizzy!

103,"Great staff, fabulous location","We had a lovely time at the Park Grand at Paddington court. The hotel staff was so pleasant and took wonderful care of us. Everyone was so sweet with our two year old daughter as well. The hotel was very clean and the room was lovely. The location was great, close to Kensington Gardens and near the Paddington And Lancaster Gate tube stations. The area was nice and quiet in the evenings and there were many shops near by where we could pick up all the necessities.",5,2016,06,15

103,Okay...,"Me and my partner stayed here for 2 nights in a 'deluxe' double room including breakfast. Upon arrival at around 13:30 our room was not yet ready therefore we left our bags with the very friendly concierge and headed out to explore. The hotels location is great, short walk to Hyde park and close to a few tube stations which was ideal. Also within a short walk to a number of shops and restaurants.
Upon check in we were not informed of breakfast times or the location of the restaurant. Concierge were helpful taking the bags to the room. 
The first room we were given was completely below the standard of a 4 star hotel. The room was tiny, just enough room to walk around the bed, bathroom tiles were cracked and sharp and the light fitting was hanging from the ceiling. After speaking with reception we were given a second room, not much different to the first, to say the room we booked was 'deluxe' these rooms did not live up to expectations. After speaking with reception a second time and talking to the supervisor on duty we were given an adequate room, larger in size with a better equipped bathroom. 
Breakfast was okay, the staff were very helpful and attentive and the selection was good. 
All in all the stay was okay, staff were helpful and polite, and the room we eventually stayed in was adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we got a good deal.",4,2016,06,07
103,You get what you paid for...,"I was sent here by a sister property. The check-in staff (Monica and Lisa?) were super friendly and very helpful. I was offered complimentary breakfast but the restaurant was too crowded and the servers were slow to seat people. in that area, why not walk out and discover some of the best eateries? I was allowed early checkin and while the room was small...very small... The bathroom was super modern with floor heating, the air con worked, the shower had good pressure even if it was small and the concierge was very helpful. Lovely room and in excellent repair!",4,2016,06,06
103,Excellent and Comfortable,"Just a 7 minute walk from Paddington Station conveniently located in the centre of London, which is all what I needed. I got upgraded to a club room which was spacious and contained a small kitchenette with all of the amenities provided.  Staff were helpful and extremely responsive, bed was comfortable and I had a very good night sleep before catching my flight the next day, since the rooms were set in a quiet building. The only draw back, was the breakfast which was very basic and did not contain many options. The breakfast table was not clean, however the breakfast service was excellent.",5,2016,06,05
103,Mr Guerras Nasreddine,"Very friendly staff ,Miss SAKINA was gracious and provided good service and always feel welcome that's why i return ,Great and lovely location near tube station the room was clean the bed was comfortable ,Shopping and restaurants very conveniently nearby.",5,2016,06,05

103,"Great hotel in a good location, clean, nice decor.",I stayed here for one night on a business trip to London. The hotel is in a good location not far from Paddington train Station and close by Hyde Park. The room was small but okay for me for one night. The room was well decorated and felt new. There was Air Conditioning in the room and bottles of complimentary water. Everything was clean and tidy. I used a towel after a shower which just fell apart and left me covered in white fluff. The breakfast was good with a decent choice. I would stay again and would recommend this place to others. Great price for London as well.,4,2016,06,02
103,Amazing!,"Staying at the Park Grand Paddington Court hotel was such a nice experience.

For me cleanliness is a top priority and they didn't disappoint.

I also loved their service; I needed an adapter and as soon as I called the reception,they sent someone up with one.

The staff at the hotel was very smiley and very welcoming which made me enjoy my stay even more.",5,2016,06,02
103,Perfect stay ,"The staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was nice and very clean, had everything we needed including tea, coffee, bottled water and toiletries. Very good for the price paid. In a nice part of London, short walk to tube stations and Hyde Park. Would definitely stay at this hotel again. ",5,2016,05,31
103,Very pleasent stay,"Stayed there for 2 nights. Rooms were small but very cozy and clean. Reception staff was very cooperative specially Sakina was very helpful. Stairs were the issue when you get room at 3rd floor. I hope they will give me room at lower floors when I will come with my family.

Will definitely stay there next time :)",4,2016,05,30
103,Nice Hotel,"One of the best hotels I have visited.The location is perfect and near from Paddington station. room was clean and very quiet. Also the recption staff was very nice , friendly and helpful specially Sakina and Robeeta. I am planning to book it again...",5,2016,05,28
103,Wonderful Place to stay in London,"Our recent stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court was most Delightful!

Truly appreciated the upgraded room and could not imagine a smaller one.

The room was lovely and comfortable & perfect for our needs.

The Desk Staff especially the woman who checked us in (cant remember her name) 

was very welcoming & delightful! Always a smile!

The use of the phone was a Fabulous 'perk' especially for those of use that do not have

international phones yet.

The atmosphere and staff were lovely & we were very lucky to happen upon your Beautiful hotel.

Set in a lovely neighborhood and easy access to everything.

The fruit, wine & drinks were welcoming upon arrival and were a lovely touch!

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will be recommending it to our friends.

Hope to return one day soon.",5,2016,05,26
103,For receptionist Sakina,I had a great time at the hotel. The hotel receptionist Sakina was so helpful. This is my fourth time in this hotel and I will be coming again in the future for sure ... I highly recommend this hotel. It is like a five start hotel!!! The breakfast is very tasty!!,5,2016,05,25
103,Hotel guest,Thanks to Sakina she is one of the best staff in hotel  and such a friendly and helpful person -always talks with smile on her face and she helped us when we were asking for the locations around the hotel - and the rest of staff can't complaint about them as they were helpful and hotel location is great and we really enjoyed stayin here and the cleaners were cleaning the room so good and we didn't have any issue with that ,5,2016,05,25
103,A great hotel once rooms had been sorted out,"I need to start this review with a bit of a negative but overall the experience was positive.
I had been using various hotel booking search engines and watching the costs of late availability for a hotel in the Paddington area for 3 nights for a visit with my wife to London.
I had originally booked a Deluxe Double room at the sister hotel to this one about 100 yards along the road, when we arrived the receptionist  advised that due to boiler problems we were to be relocated to the sister hotel and as some compensation we would get complimentary breakfast for our complete stay, Now at £12.50 per breakfast per person this was a nice gesture as I had intended having breakfast at the hotel.
We were escorted to the other hotel and promptly dealt with by reception and shown to our rooms, we had arrived about an hour early but as the room was ready we were allowed early access at no extra cost.
This is where the initial problem started , the room was tiny , if this is a Deluxe then I would imagine a standard being too small to get into the room with your luggage.
I was just about to phone reception and as about another room when they called me and asked how the room was, I explained this was too small for us and inquired about the next room size, this was a Club Double and would cost an additional £20 per night, this was a no brainer for me and we were quickly allocated a Club room.

This is where the stay just got better and better, this room although not massive was lovely , very well laid out and with all mod cons. A really nice touch is a little smart phone called a ""handy"" , this is supplied free of charge and is for the hotel guest to use and take around London , its full of apps and gives free Wifi, Internet and telephone access, room included complimentary tea/coffee and a morning newspaper.
The hotel does have a restaurant service which I didnt use other than the small lounge bar for a few beers and the breakfast area in the basement. I cannot speak highly enough of the breakfast , its has to rate as one of the best I have experienced in a 4 star hotel. 
The staff in the hotel are all exceptional in their approach and help to the customer, nothing was a bother to them.
The hotel is in a quiet location but is handy for all transport into central London 

In summary a great hotel which in the end cost me more than I had planned but it was well worth it , my advise would be go straight for the Club Double Room.",4,2016,05,24
103,Review of Park Grand Paddington Court,"A nice clean room with good beds. My daughter was very happy that she did not have to sleep on a couch. Nice service with phone with special options, newspaper etc.
Good shower, only the space into the shower was a bit limited.",4,2016,05,24
103,Comfortable Functional,"Comfortable -and functional.Appears recently refurbished. Helpful reception. Complicated access to rooms at -1 level where I had to go and come back to reception as I was given a wrong room key. Rooms are functional and I like rooms where multiple plug points are visible at side table level next to the plug so you can charge your phone, laptop and the like. Room was cozy , quite , well furnished and was medium sized but bigger than my expectations. Very comfortable bed . An empty fridge and good if atleast water is replenished after Day 1 . A nice spacious bath and toilet perhaps only lacking in a toilet brush.Free wifi is good and I dont see why hotels elsewhere charge for it. Excellent hot  buffet breakfast with a good spread and friendly service with very good coffee . You need to walk a bit around in the mornings to get a black cab. Good economic food options next door too - Chinese, Indian . Well handled checkout. Overall a good experience - comfortable and functional.",4,2016,05,21
103,Unexpectingly good,"Usually stay in IHG hotels due to membership, but was looking for somewhere for 1 night close to Paddington and the Heathrow Express.  Didn't really expect much but very pleasantly surprised.. Quality double room, good décor, great shower and ensuite, small kitchen area if you need that for longer stays.  My room was located across the road from the main reception which was surprising, but really felt comfortable in a very cosy, contemporary room.  Staff at reception were all helpful and friendly.  Would definitely stay here again.  about a 10-15 easy walk from train station.  Decent curry house a 2 minute walk away, Flavours of India too.",4,2016,05,18
103,Moved Hotel,I was booked in the sister hotel just up the road but they had hot water problems and I was moved to this hotel. In excellent condition and reception was good. Offered a free breakfast because I had been moved and room upgraded. Room well decorated and very clean and a good size apart from bathroom. When you spend so much on a room it seems a shame to make a customer virtually climb over the toilet to access the shower. Anyone less than able bodied would struggle. ,4,2016,05,18
103,fully renovated city hotel,"Rooms are fully renovated and very clean. the staff is friendly and supportive. As typical for London, the rooms are tiny but clean. I had a single room and found it difficult to place my suitcase. Hotel is located 10 minutes walking from paddington station, perfect for a short stay if you arrive with the Heathrow Express. Wifi is available and fast. Breakfast is served in the basement with no view, simple but sufficient selection at the buffet. Coffee addicts will be disappointed, though.
the booking was bit strange as I was booking on the page of the sister hotel Grand Park Lancaster Gate and ended up in this one - a little confusing.",4,2016,05,18
103,Nicely located quiet and central,"The Hotel is nice and cozy, Rooms not very big but spacious enough. Nice internet connection. Very convenient , Central 
Good breakfast usually included. Wifi fast and steady, competitive pricing usually on Booking...",4,2016,05,17
103,Lovely weekend,"We stayed at Park Grand Paddington Court for three nights at the beginning of May. 
The staff are really lovely.
Our room was nice, a bit small and strange layout, but was perfect for the two of us. 
When checking out, they offered us to leave our bags there, which was very much appreciated as we left for the airport late afternoon.

+ comfortable bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and the best location

- expensive breakfast (cheaper at the café around the corner), damp smell in the hallways

Overall a great stay!",4,2016,05,17
103,Very Happy,"The room is nice , clean, The location is great. The staff is very nice and helpfu. I want to thank specially the 2 persons at the reception Sakina and Adrea for the informations  and specially the smile ...Definatly i be back",5,2016,05,17
103,Wonderful place to stay!,"We stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago (1 adult + 2 teens) for several nights.
We stayed in a club suite. It is one of the best Hotel experiences 
we have had. The room was fantastic, clean, large and comfortable and we were 
happily surprised with the kitchenette. We valued the small perks and thoughtfulness
in the design of the rooms (beside the UK electric plug we found a U.S. and European 
plug - eliminating the need for converters. And surprised we were to find that a free
cell was available for our use while staying at the Hotel.

However, beyond the room and the convenience of the location I want to especially 
commend the Hotel personnel who were so friendly and welcoming and helpful
(thank you Roberta and Monica and the 2 Concierge whose names I do not remember). They all made us feel at home   from reception, to breakfast room to room service. 

Thank you for such a lovely stay!",5,2016,05,17
103,Delightful Hotel,"I have reviewed this hotel a few years back and this is my second review. This is one of the best places to stay near Paddington and Hyde Park area. For me it is my second home! Club rooms are fantastic and like mini-suite rooms with all the amenities such as a refrigerator, microwave and most of the rooms are refurbished with very good air-conditioning. Staff (front-office, guest relations, and restaurant) is fabulous, attentive, and always serving with smile. The General Manager of the hotel and his entire team is exceptional in every sense. You always feel cared for. This time my stay was with my family (my wife and our 12 years old son). We stayed for 8 nights. The amount of attention, hospitality, and care extended to us by everyone was an experience. Most reviewers have already talked about the location which is very central. You get choice of two stations in close vicinity and main Paddington station is also a walking distance. Hyde Park is a 5 minute walk. Apart from the good and comfortable rooms, the difference is made by the staff by their service, positive attitude, responsiveness, and warmth. For me it remains my most favorite place to stay when in London.",5,2016,05,17
103,Great and cosy,"This time I didn`t have time to check many hotels on booking.com, where I usually do my booking months in advance, because it really was a very- last-minute-trip, Park Grand popped up, looked good enough and so I booked. 
Check in was very friendly and wellcoming, I was accompanied to my room and ... so delighted. The room was tiny, that I must say, but had everything you need for a homely stay. Fortunately I travelled with little luggage, I don`t want to imagine that my darling had come with me. The room and the bathroom are newly made up, very very clean and the bed is cosy with 2 wonderful pillows and a warm cover. Air condition works well, the lightning is perfect and it has plug ins for all European devices, I think. My room was light and  quiet to the backyard, but also the street in front is a  quiet one. So don`t worry. 
The location is a 6-minute-walk from Lancaster-Gate-Underground, perfect. 
The price of the room for London standards is fantastic. 
I didn`t have any requests from the staff during my 3-day-stay in London, but I watched the staff doing a wonderful job with so many guests. 
Check out was uncomplicated and warmhearted. Thank you so much! I definitely will come back!",5,2016,05,15
103,Avoid room 405!!,"We stayed here for a couple of nights earlier this month, chosen for it's proximity to our arrival point in the capital.
Check in was efficient and the staff were generally very welcoming and helpful.
However, when we were taken to our room we were horrified to find that it had no window! There were curtains and a pelmet in a very poor attempt to disguise this fact but....the room was the equivalent of a windowless cell. We cannot believe that any hotel would try to get away with charging for this and indeed might question how this sits with fire legislation.
That said, on expressing our dissatisfaction with reception staff, we were promptly offered an alternative room. This was adequate, if a little small....and it did have a window.
Good location and plenty of eating options nearby.",3,2016,05,14
103,Paddington Delight,"Hotel is easy walk from Paddington station. Friendly, helpful staff. clean rooms. quiet rooms. Easy walk to Hyde park, Oxford Street, Tube is 3 blocks away with multiple tube line access.

Nice lounge, restaurants around the area though hotel has a restaurant.",5,2016,05,13
103,Our second visit and will return again.,"The accommodations are very good. The amenities extra good, including a cell phone to call the US for free and help you get around the area are provided. Clean and comfortable. But, the best is the service provided by a staff that will go out of their way to make you comfortable.",5,2016,05,13
103,They Continue to Excel,"We have stayed at this hotel before and have always loved the location, staff attention and great breakfast. However, they continue to surprise us. They now provide a Smart Phone for guests. With it, you have free data, texts, and calls within the UK. However, you also have free calls to the US. You can bring this with you anywhere you travel in London. Fantastic Deal and a great addition.",5,2016,05,13
103,First-class service,"Staying overnight in London I needed a hotel near Heathrow Express, and picked this one. Very impressed by the professionalism of the reception staff, who were friendly, chatty and efficient. Plenty of smiley helpers around to carry bags etc. Ten minutes from Paddington and five minutes from the park. I had wanted a single room, but had to take a double-as-single; however, they upgraded me without asking to a 'club' room which was in effect a compact mini-suite. Everything worked perfectly. It's the only time in my life that I've been phoned by reception five minutes after getting to the room to check that everything was OK. The room was in a semi-basement, although light enough, and I was woken briefly in the middle of the night by a downpour which filled some drainpipes outside my window. The safe was big enough for my laptop: often they are too small.

So, all in all, highly recommended.",5,2016,05,11
103,very nice! you even get a mobile to walk around!,"rooms, staff, breakfast,... all was perfect and on top of that, every room comes equipped with a mobile phone which, during your stay, you can take into the city (internet everywhere!). So for foreigners, no need to commence data roaming!",5,2016,05,11
103,New!,"Enjoyed my stay at this hotel, everything was new which made me enjoy this even better. Prices are reasonable as well. The room is not the biggest, it is quite tiny but just right for my husband and I. Location is just great, only a short distance from the tube. Definitely recommend.",4,2016,05,10
103,Great Place To Stay,"Close to Paddington Station, as well as Hyde Park, restaurants and small convenience store with WONDERFUL croissants.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were cozy, beds very comfortable!  This was a great value and location!",5,2016,05,09
103,Best hotel I've ever stayed at!,"What an amazing stay! We were invited in at the doors by lovely, friendly staff willing to help with our bags and make us feel comfortable and welcome. Check in was super fast and easy, yet still done with the perfect amount of excellent customer service you would want from a hotel. The room was a superb standard with everything we could have required and more. The beds were comfy, the towels were fluffy and we were even greeted with a fabulous complimentary bottle of wine and a mixture of teas, coffees, soft drinks and even a bowl of fresh fruit. After a great evening of exploring London we were easily able to find our way back to the hotel because of its excellent location and really helpful staff giving us directions, we settled in for the night in the extremely roomy and comfortable beds. In the morning, instead of going down to the restaurant we decided to get breakfast in bed, which again the staff were able to accommodate and do it with grace and friendliness. Breakfast was divine! The food was an amazing quality and again, the staff were able to cater to our every need bringing us a tray of coffee to our room after the food was given to us. After a wonderful breakfast in bed, and a superb powerful shower we packed up our things done and with regret checked out. I would 100% come back to this establishment, we are already planning our next trip! You have gone above and beyond and we thank you for a great stay. 

We would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a base to stay in London.

103,"Complete satisfied, well located","Very polite staff at the lobby (Sara was helpful every time). Well located, 7 minutes to the next underground. Rooms are very small but well equipped (usb-charging, german power supply), modern shower. Complete and good breakfast.",5,2016,05,08
103,Great Hotel and Value for money.,"My stay at this hotel was fantastic. 
It was Fantastic value for money, they had friendly staff and the room was very nice. The location was good as it was very close to Paddington station. 
Definitely be staying here on my next visits to London. 

The nicest hotel I have stayed at in London.",5,2016,05,04
103,Excellent. Will definitely stay again,"Me and the girlfriend went to London for the weekend for our anniversary. Stayed for 2 nights. Hotel was in such a good location. 5 minutes walk from Lancaster Gate tube station. Which runs right into the centre of London in 10 minutes. Also Paddington tube station was only 10 minutes away too, there is cafes and shops right outside the hotel. all the staff were very friendly and helped whenever needed. The concierge was very friendly and helped take our bags to the room, room was very clean and spacious and cleaned every day. They even put roses out for us so that was a bonus :) 

Overall a great stay for the weekend and will definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,05,04
103,A Lovely Comfortable Hotel.,"Pros:

+The hotel location is convenient for trasfer between the Pasddtion station and the Lancaster Gate station.  
+ It is very close to the Hyde Park & Kensington Garden. 
+ The room is very clean and safe.

The Park Grand Paddington Court staffs make a wonderful service, and thank Sara, Valent  and Jonathan for offering some special request.

The Park Grand Paddington Court  is a lovely comfortable hotel.",4,2016,05,03
103,Great stay,"We got a very friendly welcome and a very good stay in the hotel. We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary and got an upgrade to a Clubroom. The room was nice and clean, we sleeped very well. There was even a mobile phone with internet we could use outside the hotel for free. The staff was very friendly and helpful, next time we visit London we definitely stay here again.",5,2016,05,02
103,Two Day Business Trip at Park Grand Paddington Court,"Overall an excellent hotel, with a great location and great value for central London.  Very courteous staff. A great buffet breakfast.  Rooms are slightly small but  sufficient and efficient making well use of the space, as well as being very clean.  I was in a compact double (around 120 sq. ft. excluding the nice shower bathroom), and had enough space to lay flat my suitcase, walk around, sit on a small bench at the table.  Very close to Paddington Train station (10 min walk) for to/from Heathrow via Heathrow Express.",5,2016,05,02
103,Great hotel,"Park Grand Paddington Court is a very nice place to stay. The staff is extremly friendly and gives personal attention. The hotel is at a perfect location, nearby Hyde Park and Paddington Station. The rooms are very nice, clean and the beds are comfortable. 
We definatly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,05,02
103,"Clean , very helpful,easy to find ","Great hotel , very clean and comfortable,we got upgraded on our arrival 
Polite and helpful staff. We didn't stay for breakfast so can't comment on the food.the room was spacious and fully air conditioned and they give you a smart phone to use as you like.the one very minor thing is the noise from the street out side as the windows are single glazed.but we was on the ground floor . But I would highly recommend this hotel !! ",5,2016,05,02
103,great memory for my daughter's birthday,"We stayed 3 nights with my daughter. As it was her birthday, she discovered a gift and a piece of cake in our room. What a very kind attention ! We really appreciate the friendly staff, and the service. We would like especially to thank Sara and Roberta. 
The room was nice and the heating ground in the bathroom is fantastic.",5,2016,04,30
103,Very Nice With good service,"It was a very pleasant stay in London. Excellent location, and the service was very nice. We need to thank you to Mónica and Robert for a very well welcome in the hotel and for their professionalism. The breakfast was good, but a little bit crowded. Was a nice choice.",4,2016,04,28
103,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed for one night at the Hotel and everything was excellent. Starting from the location which is a 5 min walk from either the Paddington Station or Lancaster Gate.The room was very clean, renovated new bathroom, and quiet. The hotel staff were very helpful and polite. Breakfast had all the basics cooked very well. I would definitely recommend the stay at this hotel.",5,2016,04,28
103,"Quiet, convenient, clean.","I stayed two nights. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I had a compact double - and it was very compact - but clean and comfortable. The bed was super comfy with crisp white sheets. The entrance is welcoming with a cute cafe/bar area. Very convenient to Hyde Park, Oxford St and Paddington Station. Would definitely stay again.",4,2016,04,26
103,Good place to sleep,"5 mins of walk from Paddington Station, the Hotel is in a convenient location. Many ethnic restaurants and convenience stores nearby. The lobby staff is very very very cordial and special. The hotel is built by joining several Victorian buildings, so some rooms are not accessible without climbing up or down stairs and with a big luggage it can be difficult. If you have a big luggage, find another hotel as most rooms are so small, there will be no space to put it, and forget opening it up. The space was not larger that 6 square meters, plus the corridor and the bathroom. Bad was of average comfort. Walls are thin and I was unfortunate enough to overhear amorous activities and screams from the room across the hall for several hours. Breakfast was 26-27 Euros, so walk out and get a coffee at a nearby Cafe. Minibar was left empty, with water and coffee gratis. Price-quality balance was average.Two of the points I gave are for the pleasantness of the staff. Otherwise the facility is average.",4,2016,04,26
103,Very pleasant stay,"I hadn't actually booked this hotel, but was transferred there when my original hotel had a problem and I couldn't stay there. It was a lovely hotel and I would consider staying there again. My (single) room was small, but not claustrophobic, and it was very smart, with a lovely bathroom. My only issue was that I think the walls were quite thin as I could hear the couple next door, who while loud, weren't that loud. The breakfast was good, decent choice, good service.",4,2016,04,26
103,A new hotel - a new experience,"I found the room slightly on the smaller side bur very nice. It was clean and felt recently decorated. An extra bonus was of course that I was treated to fruit and cake on my birthday.
I did not have breakfast at the hotel.
Locationwise it was perfect.",5,2016,04,26
103,Good value but very insistent on 5 star reviews,"This hotel is in a nice and quiet area near Hyde Park, the price is very reasonable for London. The staff were friendly enough. The rooms are small, quite impressively small in fact. We were amazed at the tiny space they managed to fit a bathroom into. It's all very smart and clean. No worries there. We did book a Club Double which I thought would give us a decent sized room. I'm amazed that there are two sizes of room smaller than that! Kinda wanted to see those to see how they do it.

I can't say anything bad really, you pay £120 in London and you won't find anything much better for that price so can't complain.

I do now realise why they're so highly rated though, you'll be asked many times to leave a 5 star review on Trip Advisor on check out and and any time to talk to the reception staff. It's a bit cheeky I feel...",4,2016,04,25
103,Quiet Location very close to Paddington Station,"Two night stay in Superior room was worth the little extra cost as room came with Complimentary Fruit and soft drinks. There are numerous restaurants near Paddington Station and this is off the main roads of London and as a result was very Quiet.
Close proximity to Paddington give easy access to other parts of London via the Underground service and the hotel is within walking distance of Hyde Park",5,2016,04,25
103,Very high standard,"And at a good price.

Be careful because some of the rooms (well, room 205 based on my experience) are very small. The furniture and fittings within the room are still excellent, but small is small!

Location is very good, almost adjacent to Paddington Station.

Top quality!",4,2016,04,24
103,Nice place to be!Zeker een andere keer terug komen,"Very nice hotel,good area next to all important places to visit.Very clean i recommend it to everyone. Friendly staff especially SAKINA lovely person always ready to help.For shure we will come back another time!

103,"A really nice hôtel , really central","We took a double room Club, better and bigger than the deluxe. The bed was perfect, the bathroom big by London standards, and the room really quiet.
We had breakfast in bed the first day, but it is quite disappointing as you can't see really what to choose. and the rolls and sausages and so on arrive already cold. So the next day we went downstairs and as it is a buffet, it's much better, and even cheapper.
And you can drink more tea or coffee, as, obviously ,they don't come back with more if you have room service.
The location of the hotel by itself is great, 2 mn from Earl's court tub station and bus stop. And you can buy any excursion at the desk, directly. It's also 5 mn walk from the nearest bus stop for the excursions.
All in all, a really enchanting stay for a week end.",4,2016,04,22
103,Top attitude of Sakina the receptionist,"During my visit to my friend in the hotel, the professional attitude of the receptionist ""Sakina"" has got all my attention .. 
The way she was dealing multitasks at the same time .. 
While I was waiting, 
She helped a guy who was asking about a bar service ..
Picked up the phone and received a fault in the safe in one of the rooms .. and immediately called the maintenance to solve the problem ..
Seconds after that she helped another guy who was expected to come by a hotel guest .. 

Of course I have been served by her before all of them and I was waiting the other receptionist to get back to me for another mattar during that time .. 

On the top of that, my friend has mentioned to me her professional services and help ..

I would say, thank you Sakina, and very well done.

All the best ..",5,2016,04,21
103,Nice hotel,"Stayed one night whilst on a business trip. The location is nice and quiet in a residential area about 5 minutes walk from Paddington station. I got a club room across the street from the reception, slightly bigger than the average hotel room. Staff was helpful and attentive. Can recommend and would stay again. ",4,2016,04,20
103,Great Job Everyone ... First Class ... Well done!!,"My wife and I have just returned to Berkshire after our recent visit. We love our visits to Paddington Court, and wish to thank ALL your staff, who we always find helpful, friendly, polite, happy and efficient. Please thank whoever 'crafted' the elephant out of a towel on our bed for our first night! Next time can we be taught how to do it? We really enjoy the breakfasts too. Well done, all of you. Keep up the great work. Be encouraged; it is very much appreciated. x Chris & Angela.",5,2016,04,18
103,Peaceful bolthole in great location,"For the very reasonable price paid I didn't expect such high standards all round but had read all the reviews and chose it on this basis.  Amazingly quiet and in nice residential area yet so close to all amenities - didn't hear any traffic noise even with window open, whereas most times I'm in London, hear sirens and traffic all night long.  Room cosy and scrupulously clean with all that you need and bathroom lighting good for us females.  Staff very helpful and kindly re-charged my phone several times and when I went to breakfast, tea was on the table before I got back from buffet, despite being 9.00 (busiest time).  I was apprehensive staying on my own but I met a lovely lady diplomat whilst eating dinner (also very nice food, but plenty of other options on doorstep) and we had a really good conversation that made my stay even more enjoyable.  I would definitely recommend to anyone - lovely place with staff to match - all organised and seamless.  I stayed across the road upstairs but I expect it is similar wherever you stay.",5,2016,04,17
103,Outstanding staff,"We stayed at The Paddington Court 10/04/16 to 15/04/16, as part of our Thirtieth Anniversary. Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly, but professional staff and shown to our room. The room was far better than we had expected and whilst still part of a Victorian building, the room was modern, airy and comfortable. Although we did not sample all the hotel services, the staff were always accommodating, approachable and knowledgeable. We were overwhelmed by the kindness extended to us on the day of our anniversary by Staff ( particularly Sara Pires), and will have no hesitation returning to this hotel in future. Its location is perfect for tube access to all the major sites and is central enough to walk to the centre, but also far enough away from the main thoroughfares. We did not eat in the hotel (except breakfast).",4,2016,04,15
103,Definitely stay again ,Stayed here for one night. I didn't use any facilities or eat so I can't comment but the service was fantastic and very friendly staff. Room was clean and has a little kitchen which was ideal for me. Room 515 only negative was the TV positioning. It needs to be on a bracket that tilts as it's facing the wrong way to the bed. ,4,2016,04,15
103,Nice Hotel With Friendly and Helpful Staff,"Nice, clean rooms. Very friendly and helpful staff. It was a great pleasure for me to staty at the  PGPC. the only thing I missed is a chair in the room  to put my clothes on it.  I do hope to spend some more time at this hotel again. My special thanks to Sara Pires for her professionalism and kindness. I was earlier than my check-in time, but Sara did her best to get the room ready for me. Thank you again.",4,2016,04,14
103,A perfect hotel,Nothing less than 5 stars to this hotel though this is 3rd time i booked another park grand property but sent to this property. Nice clean comfortable room and spacious from london hotel spaces. Good breakfast.,5,2016,04,14
103,Mixed,"We booked a 'junior suite' which is situated across the road from main hotel. Based on the size of this, small to say least, I dread to think what size standard rooms are. 
The 'double bed' was a large single at best 
On the plus side; easy short walk from Paddington, clean and tidy, breakfast was nice and staff we met were helpful.",3,2016,04,13
103,Business trip to UK,"Hotel is nice 
Clean
Good service
Full hospitality
Supportive staff

In general I like the service and facilities provided especially the receptionist ( Sakina ) which was so helpfully as well as room service and restaurant staff .

One think I didn't like is most of the rooms are too congested and small",3,2016,04,12
103,Good Central Area,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my partner on a long weekend trip to London. It was my first time visiting London and not being sure of the underground or transport found the hotel with ease, as Paddington Station is only about a 5 minute walk. 

On arriving we were very early to get into our room but reception were happy to check us in and for us to leave our bags there so we could get on with our trip. The staff were very welcoming and polite.

After walking around London all day we headed back to the hotel later on and we were quickly given our room key and showed to our room by staff (across the road from the main hotel, where the suites and executive suites are). I had only paid for a deluxe room and no one had mentioned an upgrade to us. On arriving at our room 555 which was on the lower ground and away in the back of the building with a very small window making the room very dark I was very disappointed. The floor was tiled, the bed was small and nothing looked as it had on here or on the website. Not very modern and in need of an update. I went back over to reception to ask what was going on and it was at this point they informed me that we had been given an upgrade (in my opinion it was a downgrade and we had been put in a room that had not been booked for that weekend so they could get another booking for the room we had originally paid for). 

We were shown to the room we were supposed to be in and instantly felt more at ease. Very modern and welcoming. The room was small but I had read the reviews previous and did not expect it to be large it is london after all. It had everything needed for a comfortable stay. The bathroom and room were very clean and bright and modern and exactly as shown on the website. I would recommend this hotel for a stay in London but please be aware of the upgrade situation. If I had paid for a suite at a higher cost and was put into the first room I would be very unhappy. ",4,2016,04,12
103,Fantastic Experiance,I've never done a review but this hotel for me needed it. From the word go the hotel and staff were amazing. We got upgraded which was fantastic. The room was gorgeous and extremely well kept. I asked at reception as to where we could eat as my first choice was fully booked up and the staff went above and beyond managing to get us in at the restaurant that was fully booked. Just in passing conversation they knew it was my partners birthday and sent cake and drinks to room. 100% I would recommend to anyone.  ,5,2016,04,11
103,A very pleasant stay at the Park Grand,"The room was very comfortable, the staff were friendly and extremely helpful. The breakfast was superb. Close to Paddington station all the places of interest were within easy reach. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,04,10
103,Great weekend in London,This hotel is in a great location-the rooms are modern and very comfortable and the staff are extremely friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The surrounding area has easy access to tube stations and there are lovely old London pubs and restaurants to try. All in all a great find - we will definitely be back again.,5,2016,04,10
103,London discovery for 3 days,"We've appreciated the high quality of the guest welcome process within the hotel.
Our room, located in the annexe (on the other side of the street), was nice and very confortable. More broadly, quiet atmosphere to be mentioned. Access to hyde park in less than 5 minutes which is a very good point for morning runner. 
A great place to stay ! Thanks to the team for its professionalism and kindness.",4,2016,04,09
103,Great first visit to London,"My husband and I have just returned from a 9-day trip to London. We selected the Park Grand based on their reasonable rates and proximity to one of the main tube stations (Paddington, which connects to the airport via the Heathrow Express and is about 5 minutes away on foot). We were very pleased with our choice. It is a small hotel, but for travellers like us, who wanted to spend most of the day out and about exploring all that London has to offer, it was fine. Our compact room was a bit small for 2 people, but it was clean and tidy, with a nice modern bathroom with heated flooring. This came in very handy to dry our boots there at night, as -not surprisingly- we ran into some wet weather. Breakfast (as of March 2016) included tea, coffee, juices, cereal & milk, cold cuts and cheeses, fresh fruit, breads, and a hot buffet of sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, stir-fried mushrooms, cubed potatoes and roasted tomatoes. There is a small lounge that serves beverages and light entrees. The Wi-fi signal was excellent and very easy to access. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, and  housekeeping was very good. The hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood, and is at walking distance (approx. 10 min) to Kensington Gardens. There are many good restaurants nearby. All in all, it was a very good experience and we're happy to recommend this hotel.",4,2016,04,08
103,lovely stay as usual !!!,"Every time I stay at this hotel it never fails to please ! the staff are VERY friendly and efficient , the rooms spotless and very comfortable as they are luxuriously cozy and modern. the location is great and above all will definitely leave you satisfied and feeling very snug in the heart of london :)",5,2016,04,08
103,Please do not let more people know about this hotel!,"What a great place to stay in central London - quiet location yet in the heart of the City - amazingly attentive staff from check in to departure - lovely rooms, immaculate throughout.  Will definitely return as long as they are not now permanently booked up because of the positive reviews that new and returning customers will give the team!",5,2016,04,08
103,very comfortable stay,"Location very good easy walk from Paddington and from Lancaster Gate, We stayed in a room on the 3rd floor, not a big room but clean, nice and comfortable.
Very good bed. Very friendly and useful staff at the reception (in particular Andrea).
Good WiFi, very useful lounge room with pc & laser printer.
I would definitely recommend.",4,2016,04,08
103,Good value.,The room was clean and comfortable and good value for money. The staff were friendly and very helpful. Perfect location from which to access everything that London has to offer. Easy access to LHR from Paddington which is a short walk away.,4,2016,04,07
103,Very good,"It's a good hotel, clean rooms and communal areas, friendly staff. Stayed in a club room in the basement, nice size room and bathroom, but you could hear the shower going in the room next door. Got a bottle of water, tea and biscuits in the room. Also good  reception on the T.V.",4,2016,04,06
103,A very comfortable and enjoyable stay.,"The experience overall was excellent. The friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff was first class.The room was clean and comfortable and the location near to the tube and parks was good. 
I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,06
103,great central hotel,Location very good easy walk from Paddington.  Staff were lovely very kind and friendly.  Allowed me to check in early which was great as flown in from New Zealand. The room was good and quiet with all the facilities.,5,2016,04,06
103,One night stay - all you could want at a great price.,"I have just returned from an overnight stay at the Park Grand Paddington Court with my daughter. 
On arrival we were up-graded to a Club Room with very comfortable twin beds and all the extras you could need to make the stay a good experience - mini fridge with complimentary water and fruit, safe deposit, nice toiletries and hairdryer. Also a desk with connections for computers etc and free wi-fi . 
The breakfast was tasty with a good choice of hot ( which really was hot for a change  as I have eaten lots of luke-warm hotel breakfasts) and cold buffet. 
The hotel is located on a quiet street only 5 minutes walk from Paddington Station and Lancaster Gate Underground, also a short stroll to Hyde Park and Little Venice and the canal.
However, the best thing about this hotel is the staff. Friendly, helpful, and polite and nothing was too much trouble. A special mention to the concierge ( whose name, I apologise, I cannot remember) for explaining all the facilities in the bedroom including air-con, heating etc. and to the wonderful customer service manager, Sara, who arranged a surprise birthday cake and card for my daughter on our return from the theatre. Little touches like this take a hotel from average to very special and I would like to thank them for their great service and courtesy. Hope to be back soon.",4,2016,04,06
103,"Overall good, but came with unchanged bed linnen","The good points of the hotel are location, it is quite close to Lancaster Gate subway station (5-10 minute walk) and near Hyde Park; staff service is very friendly; and good breakfast (not included in price). We had booked three single roooms, they are quite small but well arranged. Free Wifi worked reasonably well, speed was sometimes a bit low but in all reliable. My biggest disappointment was that the bed linnen was not changed, they were clearly soiled by the previous inhabitant. I noticed this only very late after arriving late from visiting friends, so had to get them changed at 3:00 in the night. This was promptly done by the staff, but it should not have been necessary in the first place.",3,2016,04,05
103,Good hotel that is close to Paddington station,Excellent service by staff and breakfast was excellent. Room was on the small size for a triple room. Location is handy for Paddington station and the area where the hotel was situated was nice. Paddington high street is a bit rough and the quality of shops is low.,4,2016,04,04
103,Nice Hotel,"Visited with friends for an overnight stay. Hotel is will situated about a 5 min. walk from Paddington Station. Staff are friendly and helpful, rooms well presented and clean. Prices were reasonable for London and we had a nice breakfast before we left. Happy to recommend. ",4,2016,04,04
103,Lovely location and quality,"Stayed here last week for a one night break to visit the sights of London. Great location in a very safe feeling area, Lancaster Gate tube really convenient and located near places to eat which we did. The hotel upgraded our room to a club delux which was a lovely treat, loved the late checkout of 12 noon which helped us relax and not watch the clock in the morning. Would definitely recommend to others. Thank you park grand! ",5,2016,04,03
103,Great stay ,"Just stayed at this hotel and had a wonderful time. It's very clean and modern and the staff are so friendly. 
Rooms are small but very nice facilities. Breakfast was delicious and went on till 11am with lots of choice. 
And Sara the guest relations manager really went the extra mile and surprised my boyfriend with a lovely birthday treat.
Thank u very much for a lovely stay and hopefully we will be back soon. ",5,2016,04,03
103,Lovely stay,"We stayed here midweek at the end of March 2016.
We stayed in a deluxe twin room.
Check in was pleasant and straight forward and we were kindly shown to our room.
After settling into our room for a while we received a call from reception to check everything was to our liking. This was a lovely touch that added to our pleasant experience.
The room was clean and fresh with modern decor.
The beds were comfortable, perhaps a little softer than I am used to in most hotels, but I slept well. 
The lighting is dimable and was a pleasant feature for mood lighting. There were spot lights and also feature lights around the bed frame and the TV frame in addition to movable reading spot lights and bed side lamps.
The shower room was light and clean with both a regular shower head and a rain fall shower. There were enough complimentary shampoo and conditioner for us both to have one each.

Rooms are accessed via touch key cards.
Tea and coffee selection wasn't what I was expecting from a hotel of this standard. Tetley tea and nescafe granules. But nonetheless the tea was great to drink with supplied milk and welcome after an evening out. There was also a microwave and a fridge which we did not use.

We wanted to watch a film via our mobile phone but didn't realise there was a media centre with rgb, hdmi and other ports on the desk behind the potted plant, so we settled for film4.

It would have been useful to have had some information about how to use the ports on arrival from the porter or some information in the guest handbook in the drawer as this would have added to our experience.

The only downside to our stay, if you could really call it that, was the noise from the floorboards of the room above as mentioned in other reviews.

Breakfast was buffet style and consisted of
Scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sautéed potatoes, olives, cut watermelon, what looked like tinned peaches, cut pineapple, oranges, apples, bananas, a variety of breads and some mini Danish pastries and croissants. There were cheese slices and ham slices. I think there were yogurts and cereals too but I can't recall.
It would have been nice to see some vegetarian sausages or equivalent for more health conscious guests. 
We went for breakfast at 7.30am and there were only a few other gusts and plenty of space, however the next guest to arrive was seated right next to us which we found rather odd.

There was a fitness room in the basement with different weight dumbbells, a stepper machine, bike, crosstrainer, and treadmill and a rowing machine.  There were plenty of towels available too. This room was accessed securely using our rooms key card. 

If you were having a longer stay or travelling with large suitcases I would recommend paying extra for a larger room as floor space would be tight for more than an overnight bag, but certainly sufficient for a one night stay or light travellers.

Overall we had a very pleasant stay and would certainly return again.

",4,2016,04,03
103,7-10 min walk from Paddington & Healthrow express,"Location was in quiet area, no train noise, vibration or ambulance noise when staying next to paddington. A short walk but could be miserable if raining or wet streets so check the weather. Very comfortable bed, got the double room, for some space. Excellent bell boy. A bit of a wait on checkin and checkout. A robe, slippers. lotion and toothbrush would have been nice. Room service has limited service until 9 i think. Clean room except for hair on shoe mit box. No view from room 120. I would stay here again if it is not raining. Free wifi about 3-4 MBps.",5,2016,04,03
103,small but nice hotel rooms,"we received an upgrade which felt like a downgrade:  instead of the 'compact room' we had booked we got a 'Club room' in the basement (with a small window to the courtyard) supposingly 3 times larger than our initial booking. if this is really true, then i don't want to see the compact rooms, they must be microscopic. otherwise the rooms are really nice, quite stylish and really clean. we had to wait 10 minutes until we received a breakfast table which was a little annoying. the breakfast was typical english, but they also had some croissants and fresh fruits. the location is perfect if you want to go to imperial college or if you have to catch a fast train to heathrow. if we didn't pay so much money (140€ per night!) i would habe given 4 stars!",3,2016,04,03
103,A really great discovery,"Good quality hotels in London that don't require parting with offensive amounts of cash are hard to come by, which is why I was so delighted to discover this hotel. It was a last minute booking so I booked through Booking.com. The location was ideal for my needs, and the price was astonishingly competetitive. At check in I was greeted by friendly, smiling and welcoming staff, and told my room had been upgraded from my initial booking. The room had evidently been recently refurbished to a high standard, it was spotlessly clean, extremely comfortable, and within 5 minutes of being inside reception called to ask if everything was satisfactory. This was a lovely touch, and I think the first time this had ever happened to me, despite travelling frequently. The hotel is a short walk from Paddington station (I came from Heathrow Airport so this was ideal), there are a number of good restaurants within a few seconds' walk, and the location is quiet, particularly given the central location. I didn't eat breakfast there, but I can only imagine that it would have been of high quality, given the attention to detail throughout the hotel.  This is definitely my new 'go-to' London hotel, and I thoroughly recommend it.",5,2016,04,01
103,Great hotel for visit london,"Great hotel, great staff, I had a problem and gave me a solution very fast. I am very happy with my stay there. Very close to everything in London, close to public transport and Hyde Park. I would repeat.",5,2016,04,01
103,Great location for visit,Central location not far from the station. Very friendly welcoming & helpful staff who greeted me with a smile each time The rooms are spotless & comfortable. Great place to stay for a visit near to all the major attractions.I would definitely recommend.,5,2016,03,31
103,Wonderful stay - would love to come back :-),"Very nice room with fruits, red wine, Easter chocolate and a very nice Easter card on arrival. Also coffee and tea in room for free. Perfect cleaning every day. Very nice bed. Free WiFi that worked. Very good breakfast with everything we could wish for. Very very friendly and helpfully staff. 
Unfortunately our room was placed where everyone on this floor had to pass to go to their room and this was a bit noicy at night when they came back to their room and our window was leaking but we had the airconditioning to warm up the room, so no problem.",5,2016,03,31
103,Great Service ! Lovely Staff,"This is the second time I stayed in this Hotel. As usual, the service is amazing. I stayed for 9 Days. 

The hotel is in a very nice location - closer to Paddington Station. 

All the staffs were very helpful. Miachel,  Shakina, Cyn and Gabriel were specially  of great help.  Michael helped me with directions in London and also helped me scout for some good clubs on weekend :)",5,2016,03,31
103,Shaky start Great outcome,After a tiring journey to London I was disappointed to be told my room at the Park Grand was unavailable due to problems with plumbing and would I go to the nearby Park Grand Paddington Court. Fearing that the requested upgraded room would not be available I was surprised and pleased to be provided with a quality room matched with excellent service and overall a pleasing and refreshing two night stay. The Hotel had met their obligations and ensured that this stay was one that I will recall with pleasure.,4,2016,03,28
103,Not expensive but very small room,"As rooms in London are expensive, this hotel provides some ""not too expensive"" rooms but very small. we can say it is a fare balance. 
anyway, the hotel is very well located (near underground stations and commercial streets)
Staff is very kind - Breakfast correct (no more no less)
so not bad after all",3,2016,03,28
103,Charming stay,"It is a beautiful hotel close to central London. It’s located few blocks from Paddington Station and Underground. So, accessibility was great. The rooms are relatively small but that's what you expect in London. The rooms are clean, nicely decorated with modern décor and a proper bathroom with basic amenities. They serve English breakfast but menu is same all the day. WiFi is free with good strength but signals I found choppy sometimes, particularly while accessing after disconnecting. I requested an early check-in, which they provided just upon my arrival. Its good to be at room after a long flight, so it was really good. The overall stuff were quite friendly and helpful. Overall it has been a great experience and I would love to return.",5,2016,03,28
103,Excellent situation,"Comfortable room,state of the art shower! Very well situated for underground and Paddington mainline station. We did not eat breakfast here, plenty of cheaper options nearby. Friendly staff. Quite expensive but you are paying for location.",4,2016,03,25
103,Excellent choice.,"We chanced upon this hotel on our last visit to London last year and were delightfully surprised as to how much we enjoyed it. 
Located away from the noise and hustle bustle and yet 5 minutes away from oxford street. 
This trip in March 2016, it was our first choice to stay at. 
Smiling and courteous reception and all staff.",5,2016,03,25
103,A welcoming friendly hotel.,"The hotel is in a great location for walking in the parks, resting in cute local cafes and accessing transport to other parts of the city.
The staff were so helpful and always smiling. The rooms in the main hotel are perfect with very comfortable beds. I slept really well. 
We enjoyed the architecture in the street - we felt we really were in a grand city location.",5,2016,03,25
103,Nice and helpful staff,"We stayed in park grand Paddington grand court for 5 nights , we had the most comfortable stay , the staff in the front desk was so helpful especially this girl 'SAKINA' she welcomed us in respectful way, and she was checking on us all the time we pass from the front desk, over all the stay was amazing. 
Thank you . ",5,2016,03,20
103,Great London base,"Stayed here for one night with my daughter for a girlie couple of days shopping. Really good location within 5 mins walk to Lancaster Gate and Paddington stations. Same distance to Hyde Park which was great yet tucked away enough so that it was quiet. Felt very safe and comfortable in the area even at nighttime. 
Staff were very welcoming and helpful. The room was, as stated in other reviews, compact, but it was very clean and fresh, good decor and facilities, toiletries and tea/coffee making. Probably wouldn't be able to deal with the lack of space for more than a couple of nights. Only slight downside was our room had a rather draughty window even when closed but the curtains were heavy enough to not let this affect us. 
The checkout time of 12 could be beneficial, much later than many hotels. We didn't take advantage of this however as we wanted to hit the shops, but we were very pleased that we were able to store our luggage at the hotel all day. 
There are complimentary chocs and fruit in the foyer but what was a really thoughtful touch was that I was given a flower by the staff as it was Mother's Day. ",4,2016,03,17
103,Great Little Gem in London!!!,"Great Hotel, great service, great food, we were greatly please to have chosen this hotel for our stay in London. Our rule of thumb was exceeded: Extremely clean and comfortable!!! On top of that the service was even better, they helped us in all our needs and questions.

A very stylish hotel with great design inside and outside, we wish we had stayed longer. We had a wonderful comfortable Club Double Room with great decoration and nice bathroom.

Breakfast was delicious, we had a wonderful experience, we would love to go back any time. Location was perfect in London, close to Paddington Train Station!!! 

Highly recommended for anyone that would love a comfortable stay and a great experience. There was a Santander Cycles docking station next to the hotel, which was also a great adventure to do.",5,2016,03,16
103,Holliday,"Very nice hotel, in Paddington,near the ground station, we take a club room, this the big one , if we compare to US hotel this is a small room, but the king size bed and the pillows are very comfortable.",5,2016,03,15
103,Really Enjoyable Stay,"Nice, clean rooms; free fruit and water was a nice touch, towels changed each day. Great choice at breakfast - Staff best of all, couldn't be more helpful and courteous, nothing was a problem.

Well done !",4,2016,03,14
103,Best night sleep in a London Hotel for a long time when on a budget,"The hotel is 5-10 minutes walk from Paddington Station and is on a nice quiet street.

On arriving at the hotel, a porter opens the door for you and the reception staff are very helpful, I was lucky enough to have my room upgraded to a ""Club"" room.

The room was very clean and tidy, the bed was very comfortable and you have the usual TV, Safe, Coffee/Tea facilities, plenty of lights in the room, so it fun working out what turns off what.  Also, you had a wall panel system for outside the room to show you are sleeping, need the room cleaned etc, which was a nice touch.

For me this hotel will get me coming back, as the room was great, I slept well, plus the bathroom had a generous size bath, it was heaven when you've been on your feet all day at work, to come in and soak in that tub.

As for the staff, these people are fantastic, warm and welcoming, always helpful and plenty of them around, if you needed anything.  The bar staff make sure your drinks are topped up, which is good service and bring these to you.  I must say, I was impressed with the overall service.  

If you want to pop out you have the public houses ""cleveland arms"" (under refurb), ""Mitre"" in walking distance.  Plenty of restaurants in walking distance, but you shoudl stay in and have the Sheperd's Pie, its lovely but not as good as the one your mum makes back up north.

Differently a hotel I will use in the future and will recommend this to our business.",5,2016,03,12
103,Mr. A.Awad,"We came me and me wife for a short visit to London. We had booked for a double room.. Unfortunately we discovered that the bed was too small for us, hence we asked to be moved to a room with a larger bed. Miss Diana at the front desk, offered us a Club room with a larger bed ( thanks Diana 🌺).
The hotel is 5 min (0.3 miles) from paddington station , or 4 min walk (0.2 miles) from Lancaster gate station. 
The room is clean, staff are friendly. At our departure, it was raining and one of the two bellman did his best to find us a cab (taxi). We recommend this hotel without any doubts, and for the next travel to London we will surely book with this luxurious hotel.  ",5,2016,03,12
103,Absolutely a Top Quality Hotel,"I was so lucky to be able to stay in this wonderful luxurious hotel, I believe this hotel was completely refurbished 6 months earlier, so it is like a new hotel inside and out, the staff were excellent with me, (as a limited sighted person and a Scotsman) they all assisting me in every way, I can not emphasise this enough how really attentive  they all were, so a big thanks you Diana at the reception, Silvio and  Zdravko who assisted me within the hotel and arranged my transport, Joy who was so helpful with my breakfast needs :) and the blonde young lady who brrough me a bowl of cornflakes to my room on my arrival. Brilliant! Value for money, I really do hope I can stay in this hotel again.☆☆☆☆☆",5,2016,03,11
103,fully redone hotel - superb staff,booked a compact double bed room - everything in the room is well thought off so there is no reason for any complaint - on the contrary it is clean and comfortable with super shower and fully operational free wifi - staff is very helpful and professional - it was a very good experiance for us (couple),5,2016,03,11
103,Excellent 4* Hotel,"Fantastic location just 5 mins walk from Paddington.  Professional and courteous staff. The Club Suite rooms were excellent, spacious, very clean, modern furnishings, good shower, excellent bed.  

Only minor gripe was the room was very warm at night and couldn't cool it down with the air con, but I could open a window which looked out onto residential gardens, so no road noise.

There is a small bar area for guests where you can have bar snacks/meals.  The breakfast was very good and the dining area is clean and well set-up. Again, the staff were very professional and courteous.

I would say this is one of the best value hotels for a trip to London and would return without hesitation.",4,2016,03,10
103,"Convenient location, very friendly staff, clean hotel","Convenient location. Within minutes; London tube, bus stations, Heathrow express at Paddington, Hyde Park for a walk.
The room might be a bit small. But just to overnight and experience London it is fine.
The hotel is very clean, the staff from around Europe very friendly.
We stayed for five nights including breakfast and can recommend this hotel without doubt.",4,2016,03,10
103,Fantastic location and hotel,"I stayed at this hotel a couple of times before the renovation but now I can write that it is definitely one of my favourite hotels to stay in when I visit London.  The rooms are cosy and have all the amenities you need including a microwave oven, free wifi and free morning newspaper. The renovation was done very well resulting in a very smart and elegant 4 star hotel close to Paddington and Hyde Park. You can even walk to Oxford Street on a nice day.  The staff are very helpful and attentive.  I needed several cabs booked and they took care of everything even when I only gave them very short notice.  The concierge are doing a very good job making this hotel feel like a real 4 star and I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,03,09
103,Perfect location and wonderful employees,"We booked the hotel for two nights and found it so perfect for our first visit to London. This hotel is strategic as its so closed to The underground and to many nice shopping centers and perfect arabic restaurants as Arch Lebanon. We were so satisfied with services and help we've got by Sakina in the reception, Resvan and another guy i dont remember his name from the room services. They have amazing soul and they guided us to find out where and how to have fun in the city of London. I love these guys and i believe that you would like to have this experience... so recommended !
wish you the best
The Palestinian guys :)",5,2016,03,05
103,Fantastic hotel great location ,"I booked this hotel and was really impressed with the hotel the staff are amazing and the manager Lizzie is fabulous.
They are hard working and friendly 
I would like to mention Alisa and the team at breakfast who were always friendly and helpful.
The location is good and the rooms are also good we were lucky to get upgraded to a club room which is a generous size.
Will be back when I return to London ",5,2016,03,04
103,Good and central hotel in London,"I stayed in this hotel during a business trip and was very pleased with the choice. Rooms are a bit small but have everything you might need, staff is friendly and the wifi is great! Breakfast is good (not excellent, but good, with all the ""essentials""), however I'm not sure it would be worth paying for it (we were offered breakfast as a courtesy for a mistake in the reservation)- I'm a huge fan of Pret a Manger or Nero, both nearby.
Apart from that, I highly recommend this hotel if you need to stay near Paddington!",4,2016,03,03
103,Fabulous Stay!,"I can't recommend Park Grand Paddington Court enough. Stayed here recently for 3 nights with my partner and can't fault it at all. We stayed in a Club Double room which was just big enough for the 2 of us, and loved the added details of complimentary fruit and wine, plus dressing gowns, slippers and toiletries. The shower(s) in the bathroom were amazing - we had an overhead one and also a normal shower and both were incredible.

Staff were so helpful - we had an issue with my credit card on the 1st night but they were extremely patient and made sure it was all resolved for me. It was also my birthday when I was there, and my boyfriend mentioned this to the staff who proceeded to bring me up cake and a bottle of wine - it's these little touches that make all the difference.

Hotel was spotless, and while we never ate there or went to the bar, the menu looked competitively priced. We also arrived late on the Thursday and they provided us with takeaway menus and recommended places to eat for us.

Location is fab - 5 minute walk from both Paddington and Lancaster Gate stations. Plenty if shops nearby to grab a quick bite to eat, or any snacks etc.

All in all an excellent stay, and I will definitely be back.",5,2016,03,01
103,Great location & lovely staff,"after initial confusion on whether this or the closely named hotel down the street was ours; the welcome was warm and friendly.One of our party had a birthday and a cake with a candle was brought to their room: a nice touch. Convenient for Paddington Underground and Station and several restaurants (Try Bizzaro italian they are great fun and generous with portions). Rooms small? Yes of course, you are in London!",4,2016,02,29
103,Park Grand,"Small but very functional rooms - recently renovated and very clean. Linen and Towels were new.
Staff were most friendly and helpful making one feel at home. 
Very conveniently situated with Paddington Station and underground only a short walk away.",4,2016,02,28
103,Overnight stay,"This is an excellent hotel. Staff were friendly and extremely efficient and answered questions patiently and cooperatively. Reception also had fresh complementary fruit or, for those who'd prefer, chocolate available on the reception counter. Nice touch. 

The room I stayed in (room 101) was quiet and spotless and had a great heated bathroom floor. 

The breakfast area was clean and the food freshly cooked. Staff went out of their way to ensure the excellent food choice was available and hot. 

A good experience and I would recommend  a stay at this hotel any time. ",5,2016,02,28
103,Average with great location,"The location of the hotel is great - around 25 minutes from Heathrow airport using Heathrow Express but still in the city center (Hyde Park is around 5 minutes walking, Paddington Station also).
The room itself was very clean but tiny - basically no space to put the suitcase on the floor.
The breakfast was also nothing to write home about, especially as it is served in a rather unapealing basement.

Average hotel for an average price.",3,2016,02,27
103,"Lovely stay, small bed ","Lovely stay and suited purpose. The staff were great from when we arrived to when we left, being very helpful and friendly. There was a good selection for breakfast, cereal, different croissants, yogurt, fruit, then the hot food to make up an English breakfast. The hotel was clean and modern. We paid for the compact double room, I knew the room wasn't going to be massive but I did expect a double bed. My self and my partner average young people size struggled to be comfortable in this bed, it wasn't a double. The room has the basic dressing table and small wardrobe. Small bathroom with shower. All very clean. Beds made daily and fresh towels daily. All very positive besides the small bed! We didn't stay in the room much as wanted to be out but I would pay the extra for the deluxe double room next time. I would stay at this hotel again as its in great location to Paddington station, and suited our needs for a city break. ",4,2016,02,25
103,"An excellent stay, well priced for London ","Have stayed here several times before on this occasion I Stayed here for three nights and it was top notch!
Yes the rooms are small but they are very well finished, the bed very comfortable- wifi works well throughout 

Very friendly and helpful staff

I will stay again and do recommend ",5,2016,02,25
103,Ideal London Hotel,"Ideally situated half way between Paddington station and Hyde Park, this was a great experience. We were upgraded to a large room, which was superb, but even without that,   the hotel decor (all looks as though it has recently been completely re-decorated) and the smiling efficient, helpful staff would have made this overnight stay pretty special. Breakfast was spread between 7.30 and 11am and was delicious - although the breakfast room is quite small and needed the attentive managing that it got!
Overall, a great experience and one to repeat.",5,2016,02,23
103,Great stay with really helpful staff,"We visited London for the first time on Fri 19th, we chose this hotel mainly as it's a short 5min walk from Paddington train station so was ideal for flying in from Heathrow (Heathrow express goes straight to Paddington in 15 min). Glad we chose this hotel as the staff were so helpful and we were offered an upgrade to a suite from our deluxe double room booking at no extra charge on arrival. So many sights a short walk away (Harrods, Kensington palace) but we opted to jump on the underground into the centre and visited the Tower Bridge (do the tour and walk on glass above the road bridge, a very strange sensation!), and we had the most amazing Dim sum in Chinatown off Leicester square, definitely be back and will be staying here again.",5,2016,02,21
103,"Compact, very compact."," Stayed for 5 nights while training at merchant sq. There is no parking but I used the ncp on Edgware rd only a 10 min walk away. 5 mins to Paddington station.
Had a compact double room and they really do mean compact it was ok for one but to small in my opinion for two. Half the room was under the eves of the roof so on the low side to use.
Only one chair and tiny wardrobe built into the wall, had to hang everything facing out as it was only 6"" deep. If your looking for the hair dryer its down in the wardrobe? flat screen tv on the wall. Had two bottles of water and an apple and pear on the bedside table (nice touch). Very small window couldn't see out. no desk or fridge which was a shame. Room was clean looked ok small wet room with shower and loo ( shower certain to divide the room)
  Overall it was ok but if I had been paying I would have gone for a deluxe and not a compact on the 4th floor. 
The breakfast is in the basement in the morning ( wasn't very well so didn't have one) the bar was used in the evenings. The food was very good value compared to other places I have stayed portions could have been a little bigger but that's only a minor complaint. 
 Overall if I have to stay in the Paddington area with work I would be happy to stay here again, If I was booking for myself  I can honestly say as long as it was a Deluxe I would be happy to visit again.
 ",4,2016,02,20
103,Small but perfectly formed !,"Stayed here for one night only. Sole occupant of a compact double.

The room was very well presented - although small, its design was excellent. Modern, super-clean and very well equipped.

The bed and pillows were of high quality and very comfortable. I had a brilliant night's sleep.

The bathroom was spotless with an excellent shower and decent-sized towels.

Public areas were of a similar high standard .

The staff were welcoming and very efficient and professional. Nothing was too much trouble.

This hotel represents exceptional value for money and its close proximity to Paddington Station makes it ideal for travellers. 

Highly recommended !!",5,2016,02,19
103,Great hotel and location,"We stayed for one night in interconnecting rooms. The interconnecting room couldn't be opened, which was unfortunate but I'm sure this will be fixed quickly. The rooms are modern and clean, staff excellent and breakfast really good. The hotel is well placed for central London. Excellent value and a lot better than a premier inn even though it's similarly priced. Rooms aren't soundproofed and that would be my only criticism. We stayed on second floor which was very good.
",4,2016,02,19
103,great value,"Smallish room but all facilities, clean and comfortable. Convenient location close to Paddington station; good range of near-by cafes and restaurants. Room was facing road, but still surprisingly quiet. Staff were all excellent, friendly and helpful. We had one slight misunderstanding (totally our fault) but staff response was brilliant; 3 different people checked personally that everything was sorted out.
Amazing value for money.",5,2016,02,18
103,Retired EO,"This was my 4th stay and the recent upgrades to the j by Park Grand are fantastic. The staff have always been helpful and pleasant to work with. I will be returning for my 5th visit on 23 Feb 16 which is probably the best recommendation you can make. I love the location for the tube, local restaurants, and shopping. 5 minute walk to Paddington to catch Heathrow Express to airport. All in all hard to beat.",5,2016,02,17
103,Great hotel,Great hotel good location 5mins from Paddington station very helpful & polite staff nothing was to much trouble for them . Room was very nice & very clean will defenetly be back . Easy access to Hyde park good local shops on hand but in a nice quite location .,5,2016,02,17
103,Finally a hotel worth staying in,"After a very unsuccessful start with their sister hotels we finally got moved to this hotel and the difference was amazing. They were extremely welcoming even though we were moved after midnight and probably very cranky and they endeavored to get us into a room as quickly as possible. The room was as we expected when i initially booked this birthday treat for my husband and apart from a drafty window (which was fine once my husband fiddled with it) we had an enjoyable stay. We were treated to a special valentines morning pancake and the staff couldn't do enough for us throughout our full stay and always seemed happy to be there.
Highly recommend this hotel if your visiting London",4,2016,02,17
103,Quality accommodation,"Double room facing the rear of the building for one night.  Everything just as you would expect and more. The owners have clearly spent some on making the stay as comfortable and welcoming as possible, even down to the door staff helping you find your room and open doors for you.  Quite a change from some of the indifferent corporate 'have a nice day' welcomes you get in some places.  I particularly liked the traffic light system outside the door, the three-tap bath & shower, the fast wi-fi, the soundproofing, media hub, free biscuits and bottled water.  For non-UK travellers, there are pre-wired sockets.  I didn't have a breakfast so can't comment.",5,2016,02,16
103,Transfered here from Park grand Kennsington,"I was transferred to this hotel from the sister Hotel in Earls court (due to maintenance issues) the staff were very apologetic, we were given a complimentary breakfast and offered a free taxi from earls court to Paddington (we did need to use it as we were traveling into London by tube anyway).  at check-in I mentioned in passing that were here for a birthday, we came back to the room that evening to find; A card, complimentary bottle of wine, towel cake, slice of cake and flower petals on the bed. It was a lovely surprise.

Clean room and bathroom, Modern décor (looked fairly recent as not much wear)

Cons; the room we were staying in is a little small if staying a week or more.",5,2016,02,16
103,"Lovely hotel, but.....","I stayed at this hotel for one night for business. The room was booked by my organisation and paid for in advance by a company credit card. However, upon arrival my colleague and I had difficulty checking in due to the card holder not being present. Which we were aware of prior to arrival and had the card holder send an email (as instructed on the hotel website) to confirm that a company card was used and that the card holder would not be present. No further instruction was given and we though nothing else of it. However, reception staff (almost accusatory) said that we should have called as we did not receive a response to the email (the website did not say to expect a response) and that some sort of verification form was required from the card holder...non of this was made clear on the website. It was resolved, but after much cajoling. 

Once check in was sorted the hotel was very nice. I had a deluxe double which is nice but very 'snug'! Not much room to maneuver between wardrobes and bed - fine for one, would have been shimming if there were two. Rooms are very modern, clean and welcoming. Only downside to the room was the HUGE flat screen TV that was hung flat against the wall (not on hinge to move around) pretty much along side the foot of the bed... you would not be able to watch TV lying in bed... or from many angle in that narrow room, very strange place for a TV! Breakfast included was lovely. Competitively priced, and very high standard for a hotel in London. Would stay again. 

Stayed February 2016, travelled on business",4,2016,02,10
103,Good but could be better,"There are lot of things to say about this hotel, some good and some not so good. 
We stayed for a week and although the room was small it was perfect. It was completely equipped with tv, microwave (a great advantage), fridge and a kettle (with tea and coffee complimentary). The bathroom was small too but it was heated by radiating floor. However, the shower was great and they left new amenities every day (such shampoo, shower gel and conditioner). 
It is also a great location to explore London.
The staff was really kind and helpful. 
Anyway, the down sides are a few. The window did not shut properly and it was a bit cold at a times as the heating system was automatically going down to 21 degrees specially during night time. The duvet was not width enough for the bed size. The carpet could do with a bit of frequent cleaning (hoovering). Wi-Fi connection is terrible in the upper floors.
",3,2016,02,10
103,Excellent Hotel.,"This Hotel is so close to Hyde Park and a short walk to Paddington. 
The Hotel staff were so helpful and nice, the room was clean and well laid out.
The breakfast was a great selection of cooked and continental. 

I will stay here again as I really liked the room, felt the staff were really helpful and in the words of my Partner.
""They had a proper Hair drier.""",5,2016,02,08
103,Lovely hotel but....,"Hotel itself and area were lovely but my only gripe was the room size,from the end of the bed to the wall was less than foot so my wife had to crawl across the bed to get to the dreessing table to use her straitners but apart from that the room was superb an the staff were lovely",4,2016,02,08
103,They have under floor heating and elephant towel scupltures!,"We stayed for one night while celebrating my 28th birthday in London. Originally we were upgraded to the Park Grand Hotel due to the sister hotel London Premier Notting Hill Hotel having some refurbishment done. 

What a wonderful stay! The staff are friendly and very helpful. I loved the towel elephant sculpture they left us with a good night message and chocolates! They know their audience well! The complimentary fruit, drinks and fluffy robe were all lovely touches. The bed was massive and very comfy. The room was nice and quiet. The bathroom had under-floor heating! What a stroke of genius! I wish all hotels had that in their bathrooms!

The only tiny problem we had was the size of bathroom, the size is fine if its one person, but a little tricky to manoeuvre if there are two people. The size of the shower was great.",5,2016,02,08
103,Great stay ,"We stayed here for 3 nights and this hotel was excellent-the room we had was very modern clean and comfy with little extras like under floor heating, the hotel provides an excellent breakfast and great service is received by all staff- with the tube station just around the corner this hotel is great for anyone that wants to explore London or stay on business - will defiantly use this hotel again - thank you ",5,2016,02,07
103,Superb Stay !,"This location has alot to offer, its central to london and the station is very close.  The hotel knew which restaurants to recommend which were near by, and lived up to their expectation.

Reception - very friendly check in, assisted with wake up calls and newspapers, carried luggage to my room which was very kind, and responded to any request promptly.  Every time I entered/left reception which say goodbye or hello .... its the little things which make the difference!

Room - amazingly clean, presented and up to modern day spec.  Little extras well thought out in club room you get a fruit plate, wine, little toiletries which are all great and the bathroom has a heated floor and a very nice shower.

Restaurant - again excellent, almost every item you could want for breakfast and all hot and fresh.

Staff are great and make this overall one of the best, and fair price hotels I have stayed in, in london!..... 5 star hotels at times dont compare to the service offered here.

Well done team, and keep it up, I will be back!!!",5,2016,02,05
103,Modern and clean,"Stayed for one night while on a business trip. The room was booked by my company and paid for in advance but we had a lot of trouble checking in because the card holder wasn't present. Please be aware that they need some sort of form sending to them when card holder isn't present, but this isn't clear on website. Nevertheless we sorted it in the end. I had booked a deluxe double and got upgraded to a club which had a very large bed. My colleague had a deluxe double which had less room but fine for one person. Very modern rooms, very clean and fresh with nice bathrooms. Free wifi and an extremely good breakfast. Staff were very friendly and professional. 
Stay here for a competitively priced, and very high standard hotel in London. Will definitely use on next business trip. ",4,2016,02,03
103,Excellent! Best staff ever!,"Have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. The room was excellent, very clean and the bed especially confy. The hotel has a very good location in a quite, convenient area. Best of all is the staff! All very helpful and always smiling. Special mention to be made of Christina and Gabriel! It was always a pleasure to talk to them and they really go out of their way to help you! Thank you for a great stay! Will be back for sure!!",5,2016,01,31
103,Excellent,"Stayed at the Park Grand Paddington Court  for 4 nights recently & cannot rate it highly enough. From the minute we walked in the door we had first class service. The hotel itself was first class - our room was great with everything we needed - hairdryer, toiletries, brilliant shower - huge wall mounted telly! The breakfast catered for everyone - my partner has coeliac disease & he was given his own bread & cereal - once the staff knew he had CD the minute we walked into the room for breakfast each morning the staff had his bread & cereal sitting ready for him. Location was first class - it was less than a 5minute walk to Hyde Park. Also wifi was free - great if you are trying to keep in touch with family. Will definately come back.",5,2016,01,28
103,A good choice for the business traveller,"The Park Grand was exactly what I expected and paid for; a reasonably priced quality accommodation with all the facilities I'd expect for an overnight stay in the city. The room wasn't large but it was well appointed and the ensuite was modern and in pristine condition. The hotel is handily situated close to Paddington station yet is not in a noisy location. If you want a room to the kind of standard you would get at a Hilton but at half the price, the Park is a good choice. I will stay there again.",4,2016,01,28
103,Excellent service - very good location and price -- small rooms,"Stayed at Park Grand Paddington for two nights while on business in London.  The stay was comfortable and pleasant, but the room was rather small.
The hotel is located a few blocks from Paddington train station and within easy reach of two underground stations.  Turned out to be a very good location for travel within London and to cities north of London.  The neighborhood is fine and has a number of stores and restaurants, many of which are open late in the evening.
The hotel itself is very interesting -  made up of old buildings and areas, connected by hallways and stairs.  Navigation within the hotel is a real challenge at first, but the staff is so very willing to help out that it is not really an obstacle.  My room required going up stairs, through a bar, down a hallway, up stairs and down a few steps again, down a hallway, up more stairs and then down a hallway.  It was a good thing that a porter came with me.   The lobby is nice and comfortable, as is the bar next to it.  The breakfast area is downstairs and not all that easy to find, but it is a nice area and offers a fairly good selection with the usual eggs, bacon, breads, accompaniments, fruits, yogurts, etc.  The workout room is also in the basement and finding it required again getting the help of staff.  It is small and has older equipment, but it works okay.
My room was nice but really small.  The decor is modern and recent.  There is a good bed that is comfortable for sleeping.  There is a nightstand and a closet next to it.  Both were fine, except that the large safety box in the closet prevents shirts from hanging properly.  The desk is really really small but has all the plugs and things one might need.  Also, there is a small shelf right above the desk which really helps for storing stuff.  The bathroom is reasonably sized and has a good shower and some floor space.  But there is little space around the sink and the door opens right into the space in front of the sink.  Slight awkardness but nothing serious.
The service at the hotel was excellent.  Everyone was willing to to go the extra mile to help.  Staff were quick to come with me to help navigate and find things, but it went beyond that.  When needing coffee in the morning, they quickly procured that and taxis were found quickly with great enthusiasm and energy.  Kudos to the staff.
Will be happy to stay again there - especially now that I can navigate reasonably well!",4,2016,01,28
103,Stay Here!!,"I've been staying in London hotels on business for some years and I am used to having to choose between eye watering prices or sub standard accommodation. Thanks to the Park Grand I will no longer have to make this choice as this hotel has fantastic quality and cleanliness for very low cost by London standards. From my first contact with the staff (when I called having difficulty with web booking) through to my final departure I simply couldn't want a better experience. Good value, fantastic accommodation, even better staff, I will be back.  Stay Here if you need a London hotel. I am not related to anyone at the hotel and I don't generally review.",5,2016,01,28
103,Clean and with good service,"We stayed there for 2 nights and were impressed by how nice and clean everything was!
The staff were friendly and helpful and the standard were higher than we expected due to the price we payed. I can certainly  recommend this hotel!",4,2016,01,23
103,Great value & location ,Great value accommodation within easy reach of the main shopping areas. Rooms very clean and looked recently refurbished (not confirmed). Staff friendly and coupled with the value we had no complaints. Facilities on offer looked great although we didn't use them. ,5,2016,01,21
103,Wonderful stay,"My partner and I stayed here for three nights in the deluxe double room. We were very impressed by the quality of the place for money as we did not break the bank to pay for the room. The room was huge in comparison to most London hotels in the same price range, the staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly, and the bathroom was gorgeous. The bathroom had heated floors which was a luxury, the tv was huge and the room was cleaned every day so it was super clean. We had a wonderful experience overall at this hotel although we were woken up at 6:30am by the fire alarm which only rang for about 10 seconds... That was the only complaint we could possibly make about the place. Lovely room, excellent service, great value for money.",5,2016,01,20
103,Perfection,"Mine and my husbands experience (staying for one night) couldn't have been better, and with such great value. Though the room was very small, it was immaculately clean and seemed very cosy even with its modern decor. The staff were pleasant and plenty knowledgeable; every question answered and every request fulfilled. Breakfast was included in the price too (which is a major plus for us).
Tip #1: Book directly on their website.
Tip #2: Book at this branch if you want to be in the area (and not Paddington or Lancaster Gate). The rooms are remarkably cheaper and both stations are a short walking distance - and with Hyde Park 2/3 minutes away anyway!",5,2016,01,18
103,Best hotel experience I've ever had!,"I guess the topic says it all. Without a doubt the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in.

I lived here for 2 days while it was still Best Western.

I had surprised my girlfriend with a trip to London. I found this hotel on booking and booked a Club Double Room.

We arrived early evening and were welcomed by a very friendly staff.
We were assigned a room on 1st floor and our luggage was carried to our room. The man carrying our bags gently apologized that we had to walk up some stairs. A nice gesture, but we’re at good health so we managed.

He opened the door and even gave us a small ”guide” in the room. A huge bed, a very nice bathroom, a 32” TV, AC, free WIFI, safe, microwave, robes, slippers and a small table with soft drinks, a couple of small bottles of wine. I’m used to the latter in a minibar for very steep prices, but this was complimentary. 
On the bed the towels were folded like swans. Almost so you don’t want to use them :-)

I could go on and on about the room; it was great!

We arrived the day before my girlfriend’s birthday. That evening I went down to the front desk to ask them for a small favor. I wanted to surprise her with some flowers the next day and wondered if they could help me with this; for a small charge of course.

The guy asked me to wait a minute while he went to the back and talked with some colleagues.
When he came back he came with the following suggestion. 
He thought that a simple bouquet of flowers was to simple, so he asked if we were going out sightseeing the next day. I answered yes and told him we would be back around 6 o clock. 
“What if we cover the bed with rose petals when you come back?”
I loved the idea and asked what I had to pay for this, but he just cut me off and said that this was something they wanted to do for us. I could get a bottle of champagne if I wanted, but then I would have to pay. The rose petals were more than enough.

We went sightseeing that day and returned to our room around 6 as planed. 
What was waiting inside really brought tears in my girlfriend’s eyes.
Not only was the bed covered with petals, on the bed there was 2 pieces of cake with birthday candles and a “happy birthday” card from the hotel. 
This was way more than what I’d ever expect and a fantastic gesture from the staff.

When we came downstairs the next day the staff also congratulated my girlfriend.
For me it’s the little things that matters the most, and what the staff did for us made this trip to London just perfect.

The hotel is located only 5-6 minutes walk from Paddington station. As you come from the underground, take left, walk a few blocks and you’re there.

I know for a certain that I will stay at this hotel next time I’m in London. I actually look forward staying here again.
You’ll have no problem finding a cheaper hotel room in London, but you know what? The experience and service makes everything worth it.",5,2016,01,12
103,Meant for Hobbits?,"Ten minutes walk from Paddington Underground and well enough located to be close to shops and restaurants. The room is well equipped with the all the basics as well as a flat screen TV that seems over sized for such a tiny room. The bathroom is minute but served as well since we really only used the room to sleep and refresh after a long day sight seeing and travelling around London. There is hardly space to put down more than one suitcase and I bumped my head more than once against the sloping roof on the window side while making my way around the bed. Clean, quiet and pleasant enough for a hole in the wall. Friendly service, tiny bar.",3,2016,01,11
103,Very nice place for a stay in London,"I was upgraded to an executive suite for the week and while small, the room was very comfortable.  The suite section is across from the main hotel and is located on multiple floors, but through multiple buildings, which can get a bit confusing!  Shower and amenities were quality, loved having a tea maker and biscuits daily.  Very convenient to Paddington station -- just a 10 minute walk.  Many small convenience stores for breakfast and lunch fare. ",5,2016,01,08
103,Good hotel,"It was a right choice. The neighbourhood is quite. 
The hotel was very clean, they cleaned the room every day. The device was excellent, we arrived before the check in time but they gave us the room and we could do the check out one hour later. They gave us a room bigger that we booked. Great experience. We would choose again that hotel. ",4,2016,01,07
103,Our New Year Stay,"This Hotel is very clean and the staff are very polite. However the rooms at this Hotel are very small. When my wife and myself left on Saturay 2nd January we had become experts in Limbo Dancing.
If you can't Limbo when you arrive you certainly will when you leave.
Very tight space in bedroom and the bathrooms are not suitable for people above 6 feet tall and weighing over 10 stones. Wow what a challenge to Limbo in the bathroom to use the toilet or ""Double Limbo"" into the shower.
Restaurant leaves room for alot of improvement and the food was very poor. Many people complained during our stay and returned their food to the Chef.
Will not stay again at this Hotel and would not recommend to anyone.",3,2016,01,03
103,Lovely Stay,"My husband and I booked this hotel for an overnight romantic break, upon our arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to a club room free of charge which was a very nice surprise. We were shown to our room by a very helpful porter who appeared very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about our room and the hotel. We were very impressed with the quality of our room it was beautifully clean and well maintained, the decor is very corporate,stylish and contemperary, we prefer the corporate look! Everything was perfect with our stay until it came to breakfast, we like to have breakfast in our room when the facility is available, and although this was offered there was no breakfast menu available and you are just told to call the restaurant in the morning to order what you want apparently until recently they had a system where you tick off what you want on the menu and hang on your door like in many hotels but this has now changed. When the food arrived it was delicious and resonably presented however, upon delivery of our food the porter issued us with a bill for £35 for the cost of the breakfast, we informed her that we had already booked and paid for breakfast as part of our room rate, we had to call down to reception to deal with this and then my husband had to go down to reception and show them our conformation email before this was accepted, the receptionist then located the appropriate notes on the booking stating that we had already paid and everything worked out. This was a little frustrating and inconvenient but not the end of the world and it did not ruin our stay and will not stop us from booking up to stay there again. Our score of 4/5 is because the hotel is lovely but staff training and communication needs work. There were two scales of staff at this hotel ranging from fantastically helpful and enthusiastic to unmotivated and sloppy, perhaps training needs to be improved to ensure the sloppy workers keep up with the good ones. This was the only thing stopping our experience being a 5* one, none the less we will be back!",4,2016,01,03
103,excellent customer srvice,"I was, my husband and I, in park grand lancaster gate hotel but we did not really like the room as soon as we asked for a room change the staff helped us and found a greater room in park grand Paddington court which was 2 min walk from the first hotel. I really liked the Paddington one with its big rooms also I really appreciated the staff especially Sakina, She was very helpful and very nice. 
I will absolutely go again to that hotel. 
It is 7 mins walk from hyde park and everything is near by.",5,2016,01,03
103,Very perfect stay ,"The welcome was fantastic and good staff although we arrived too early to check in but thanks to the receptionist  who speak also arabic helped us a lot we were worried not to find someone who speaks arabic .. And The hotel great is very clean , close to oxford and the good places to visit in London .. I give them 5 stars ",5,2016,01,02
103,Works Christmas Breakfast,"My wife and I were looking for a hotel near the office in Paddington and came across this one. We booked a last minute room direct with the hotel, absolutely great value room and as I had inadvertently booked a compact double room we got upgraded across the road into a very nice room, kingsize bed en suite plus a breakfast area with fridge & microwave should you so desire. The staff were very accommodating and the overall experience was very very good",5,2015,12,31
103,Wonderful Stay!!,"The hotel is really very nice and clean. And, the hotel staff is very polite and helpful. I stayed there for around 10 days on a business trip. But, the service of the people at the Reception, in the restaurant and everywhere was completely awful. I am really thankful to Tina, Lizzie and Alisha for their best treatment and services. They are very nice and always ready to help you in any ways. They made this trip memorable for me. I will always prefer to go and stay there. ",5,2015,12,30
103,Excellent staff and hotel,"We have just had 3 nights at this property after Xmas day. The rate of £115 a night including breakfast was excellent. The staff from check in to departure were fantastic including excellent work from the porters!
We had room 304 after our original room was meant to be in the basement which I declined. Sara at reception had no problem changing rooms for me. The size was good for London and it had a very nice bathroom all which were very clean. Breakfast was very nice. There is a small bar in the hotel. If you are staying over the road you just use this one. The wifi is free and worked well. If you have a car parking is approximately 10 mins walk away. We used another one which only charges £20 for 24 hours, it is further down Bayswater road. We will have no hesitation in staying here again.",5,2015,12,29
103,Great hotel,"Just check out today and i have to say, everything was perfect! Got an upgrade from deluxe double room to club room without asking, also it was very clean, modern and nicely decorated. The staff was brilliant and helped me with the luggage, and the size of the room was perfect taking into account what rooms you get in London at more expensive hotels. I definitely recommended it to everyone and will stay here again next time! ",5,2015,12,29
103,Pleasant and comfortable hotel,"We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday. The staff were lovely - very friendly and helpful. Rooms quite small and compact (we had deluxe single and double rooms) but everything was clean and comfortable. The only slight disappointments were that the bar closed at 11 and there could have been a better selection of pastries at breakfast. Overall, however, a highly recommended hotel.",4,2015,12,27
103,Good hotel,"Stayed over 4 nights. The hotel is very clean and fresh; rooms are on the smaller size but if you are visiting London and just need a bed to sleep, it is perfect. The breakfast is pretty good with choices. Staff are polite. Good location for places to eat and see, tube and Paddington  rail station. Reasonable price.",4,2015,12,24
103,Anazing,"Location of hotel was excellent, close to two tube stations. 5 min walk to Paddington centre with plenty of restaurants and pubs. The staff are really friendly, when we arrived the staff took our bags to the second floor and showed us around the room and how to work heating etc. The room was small but suitable for people who are going out each day, such as tourists as only spending time in there to sleep etc. The maid service was spectacular each day and the room sparking clean every night we came back with fresh towels and bedding. When we arrived I was asked what the occasion was I advised it was my birthday and that night j came back the below picture in the hotel room which I thought was really thoughtful and lovely of the hotel to do.  I requested an iron the second night and the staff brought a iron and ironing board 
, we then asked about dressing gowns and was also brought a package with a dressing gown and slippers each. I can't fault the hotel at all and guarantee I will be back for my annual London trip next December . Thank you .

103,Lovely hotel ,"We have just returned home from London for the weekend and we stayed three nights at this hotel which is a change from the normal hotel we stay at when visiting London. We had a deluxe room and the room was very nice and cleaned every day with fresh towels. The staff at this hotel are very polite and helpful on reception and the dining room, cannot be faulted in any way. The location of the hotel is ideal as there is lots of shops and pubs close by as well as only a short walk to Hyde Park. Thank you for making our weekend enjoyable. ",5,2015,12,21
103,Great location and value,"This newly furbished hotel, extremely conveniently located to get to from London Heathrow has become my favourite hotel in London. Located within walking distance to both Paddington and Lancaster Gate tube stations, it made getting around easy.

I have stayed in many B&B's in the same area, but the amenities and decor of this hotel was far above others in the same price range. Staff was extremely polite and helpful. Whilst the room was small, it is similar to most hotels one finds in Europe. 

Since the hotel has recently undergone a refurbishment, the decor was up to date and amenities like central heating/air conditioning, heater mirrors and floors in the bathroom, etc are going to be hard to find in similar priced hotels.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again when I visit London next.",5,2015,12,20
103,"Great room,  friendly staff ","Stayed in a double club room.  Nice clean modern room,  reasonable size, Good TV and connections,  comfortable king size bed, quiet room,  proper size bath. Wifi in room is good.  Not super fast but enough for basic use. Location is a short walk from Lancaster gate tube and not far from Paddington so it's very convenient.  Staff very friendly. Excellent value for money. Nothing I can fault really.  Maybe the view... But I wasn't expecting palm trees and sea in central London... ",5,2015,12,18
103,Stay,"Great location, great stay and good service. All around great value hotel....and free easy access wifi too

Gym could us som maintenance though and if it were a bit bigger that would be then make a perfect stay",4,2015,12,18

103,Great Location for Christmas Shopping.,"We booked this hotel without too much research after we cancelled our original trip to Paris. Only a very short walk from Paddington Station which was great as we were able to find the hotel no problem. Lovely hotel with very friendly and chatty staff. They took our bags to our room while we checked in. Reception was very busy when we arrived but we hardly had to wait. The hotel is like a rabbit warren with loads of corridors and staircases but we found our bearings quite easily. Our room was small but perfect and very modern. It had all the things you'd expect such as mini bar facilities, TV, Free Wi-Fi and patio doors which lead out to a small courtyard. Double bed was very comfortable too. We didn't use the bar in the hotel but it was quite busy when we arrived and is next door to reception. Its only a very short walk to both Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate tube station and we used both in order to get to Oxford Street. Oh and there is a great old fashioned pub about a 2 minute walk from the hotel called The Mitre Townhouse. Well worth a visit! Would happily stay at this hotel again and would highly recommended to anyone who might be looking for accommodation in the area.",4,2015,12,15
103,Nice and warm place in the central London,"Beyond the small spaces, that by the way is a common thing in central London, this is exactly what I was looking for in a short business trip to London. The staff were nice and very helpful in any situation. The room although a little bit small (gosh the bed was too short and I'm just 6.1) had everything I needed. Considering everything I think I'm going to getting back here whenever I come to London for a few days.",4,2015,12,11
103,"everything was great, again any time","The hotel's location was perfect, the subway was only a 5 minutes walk away on. Very nice and quiet rooms, good facilities. The English breakfast was good and the staff very friendly and helpful. all you need...",5,2015,12,11
103,exceptional stay,"Absolutely lovely hotel and stunning room in an excellent location, only 5 min leisurely walk from Paddington, with lots of restaurants and shops nearby. As a single woman I felt very safe walking in the area at night. I've stayed in many hotels in this area because of the quick access from Heathrow but this is by far the best. The staff is very friendly and welcoming, Sara at the front desk is exceptional, she made me feel like a valued guest and her smile was contagious, she gave me many helpful hints on the area and made me feel very welcome. 
Location, location, location , you are so central to everything with great tube and train access, it really is such a great value  and the huge modern room with fantastic flat screen tv and excellent selection of channels if you find you need to relax in the room. The rain shower was a nice touch and very welcome after a long day sightseeing and the heating was perfect for those cold evenings. Plus the bed was super comfy. I would recommend a stay here without hesitation, I would happily stay here again.",5,2015,12,09
103,Very nice!,"Our room was really beautiful and had all facilities needed by a young couple. The view was really nice and the location of the hotel was perfect. The bus/tube station was 5 minutes away. Gabriel, one of the staff members was really nice and helped us during our stay with transport information and was always friendly with us.",5,2015,12,08
103,So pleased with our choice.,"Visited London with my mother for a three night stay and opted for the Paddington Court (it was a whopping £140 cheaper than Premier in and included breakfast!/) 
Super friendly and helpful staff. Whole place is immaculate. Buffet breakfast was fab. Our room was on the ground floor and compact, which is to be expected in London but clean and of a high spec, the shower room was spotless with heated floor.  Hotel is located off of one of the main drags so minimal traffic noise. Generous size tv. Beds were comfy.  Easy flat walking to Paddington or Lancaster Gate tube and some nice small restaurants close by for evening meals.
In short, mum and I had a lovely stay and would happily stay there again:-)",5,2015,12,04
103,Receptionist must be careful regarding new guests,"In the moment that I arrived there the receptionist in the hotel not gave exemplar reception, maybe because saw me with chips in hands and an energy drink, or, maybe the hat that I was wearing but is common, whatever. After this, she put us in a occupied room, but the gentle man from Bulgaria solved our issue and we was relocated quickly for another room as well!",3,2015,12,04
103,Great location and staff!,"Excellent location just a few minutes walk from Lancaster Gate. Staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly (even when I brought a supermarket-bought bottle of wine to be opened as we lacked a corkscrew). Breakfast is pretty standard: hot fried breakfast, cereal, fruit etc., can't fault it, certainly set us up for a day of walking and site-seeing. 

We were in a small, double basement room. While it was certainly small, it was fine - we needed somewhere to sleep and shower, it did the job. Bottled water wasn't replenished after the first day, fine, we drank tap water. We stayed three nights and housekeeping did an excellent job returning the bed to a pristine state.

My only real criticism: the room and restaurant were absurdly warm. I thought I would actually dessicate overnight. It was a relief to step outside the hotel and get some fresh, cool air, and this was despite faffing with the aircon.

Altogether, a very pleasant stay, shame about the stuffy room but the room itself, the staff and the hotel were great.",4,2015,12,04
103,Good choice for a city-trip,"Excellent service by all of the very helpful employees.
The room size is rather small but, at least at the rear side, very quiet. The room size is no problem if you are visiting London all day long and not staying in the hotel.",4,2015,12,04
103,Smelly room for 200€!,"I spent three nights there. It supposed to be a nice hotel and maybe it is but I get the room at the basement (B level) and that was very bad.
I don't know how it looks like and the first floor and above but if you choose this hotel try to avoid the basement because it smells on mold, the window is oriented against the wall, the bathroom is so small that you have no place to put your staff except at the floor.
I took the breakfast too , additionally 13 £. If you are staying for the one night it's ok, but it was the same for the all three days!",3,2015,12,03
103,Old but modern,"The hotel is situated on 5-8 minutes from Paddington metro/railway station. Old building but rooms are equipped in cosy and modern style. Free WiFi works well. Unfortunately during my stay (summer) there were massive repair works, which makes access to some of the hotel few entries not so easy. ",4,2015,12,02
103,Lovely staff and hotel,"I stayed in a single room on the 4th floor. Room was well-decorated with all the necessary amenities, was cleaned very well each day, and also had heated tiles on the bathroom floor, which was a nice touch. It probably lacked a bit of storage space but it was definitely cosy & welcoming and was fine for the time I was staying (only a few days). Lovely area not far from Hyde Park. As for the staff, they were all so pleasant and eager to help, it brought a very personal touch to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,11,30
103,Fantastic!! ,"Great hotel, modern room, good shower, comfortable bed, exceptional value, delicious breakfast, courteous staff. Thanks for a great stay!! 

Based on our experience if anyone writes a derogatory review they have far too high expectations.. 

Thank you again!!  ",5,2015,11,30
103,One of the best value for money hotels in London,"I stayed at this hotel for a business trip and comparing it to many other places in London, the room was of a fair size, all very clean, breakfast despite being served in a small room very good and of a good quality. The location is 5 minutes from the Paddington station, which gives you the location without the railway noise. The street ruining past the hotel are also very quiet. The reservations were very good and provided all the information we needed. Thank you again for a great stay!",4,2015,11,29
103,Great Staff..but advertising is misleading,"Iv stayed at the Park Grand Paddington a couple of years ago. I stayed in a basic room which was down in the dungeons with little light. This year I decided to book again and having seen the photo of the club room thought this would be a great room to share with my partner on her 40th celebration weekend. On arrival at the Park Grand Paddington we were informed they had no room for us, despite booking two months ago and asking for a high window room. We were ushered to the sister hotel Park Grand Paddington Court. After checking in twice.....we finally get our room. Nice and tidy with everything you need. But it certainly does not match the advert on the website, as the room is small and ensuite shower room certainly doesn't allow for any cat swinging. You do get water and fruit on your arrival, but if staying more than one day it's not replenished. So top tip ...book one day and then book another and you'll get another room with the perks again!! Oh forgot to say you can use the private club users lounge though. Sounds good eh? You'll find the tiny little room off reception with a TV, computer and couple of chairs.... Give it its due it is a little bigger than the bathroom and you may get 4 people in it. So if you haven't picked up on any irony... Beware of advertising and perks which are ....well ...I'll let you decide. One thing I will say, which I reviewed before on a hotel forum, is that the staff are very polite and accommodating. Anyway we have another night to go , so I'll report again soon",4,2015,11,28
103,Good Hotel after horrible experience at 2 other Shaftesburys,"This was a horrible experience; so bad I am writing my first review for anything ever! After reserving a room online, I got to the hotel only to be told they were undergoing maintenance so we had to be moved to another hotel; however they ensured I paid for my room at this hotel which I obliged but I should have known better. I had read other reviews where people have had the same experience. We got moved to Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington Hotel; we got there and we had a horrible basement room with a horrible smell and view of rusty boilers etc. We went back to reception to request another room only to meet another customer there with the same  complaint. Whilst there, a man came down to reception with a cut on his knee because there was a dip in his room as soon as he walked in and he took a bad fall. The employees weren't helpful and we had to tell them to assist the gentleman because he was bleeding. We decided we wanted a refund, only to be told we had to come back the next day and discuss with the manager - I wasn't stupid enough to leave without my money. We eventually got moved AGAIN to Park Grand Paddington Court London. There was no car park as we were wrongly told by the previous hotel so had to drive back there to park our car and then they booked us a complementary cab back to the Park Grand. They decided to upgrade us to the club room. The room was absolutely lovely, i cant fault it. But after all the stress we'd endured we just wanted to sleep and unfortunately didn't get to enjoy the room or hotel (It was 3 hours in and about 2 am by now). They did give us late checkout by an hour and were very apologetic in the morning. I cant fault Park Grand but the other 2 hotels were horrible!!! And no-one should ever be put in those horrible basement rooms!!!!",5,2015,11,28
103,holiday break,we have stayed in many other properties in that area over the last year  this hotel was excellent the best  the staff were helpful friendly and couldn't do enough for you room was lovely and this will be our now choice every time,5,2015,11,27
103,Great help in making our London trip very pleasant,"Rooms were spotlessly clean and well serviced. Beds were very comfortable with good linen. Bathroom and showers very clean and modern. Other good points were - Free wifi, room safe deposit and coffee & tea facilities. Wardrobe space was adequate for short breaks and good temperature controls but they need a bit better explanation to get the best out of them.

Breakfast was very good and had a large variety of choices and could fuel you with energy well into the afternoon. Breakfast service was clean and very well organised by the young lady in charge. As more of her staff improve their English they will get even better, but their helpfulness and the breakfast experience would be hard to beat in much more expensive hotels.

The people in the Concierge service also deserve a mention for their courtesy and knowledge of local areas and transport services as well as their willingness to help with luggage.

For us the location was perfect - with access to Hyde park, Lancaster gate and Paddington underground stations and good small restaurants all within approx a 5 minute walk. 

The Standard rooms are not large and club rooms slightly larger. The room views are street or gardens and are in keeping with a city suburb hotel.

For our short break of 4 days, although spending most hours out of the hotel -the hotel location,facilities and service provided by a most helpful duty manager was an essential part of making our trip so pleasant and value for money.

Would definitely stay again",4,2015,11,25
103,Amazing ,"I was here just for 4 nights and it was awesome they have a good hospitality I recommand this hotel. The funny man Gabriel he is very helpfull <3 

 The room very nice and clean also the bed is comfortable. 
 The location is near to many stations .....

103,hotel ok for london,"positive aspects:
the room was nice, there was a welcome decoration on the bed with free bottles of water and cake
the neighbourhood was pretty ok and clean, we felt quite safe
the staff was very efficient and helpful
negative aspects:
the hotel was rather expensive as all 4stars hotels in london 
the room was very very small, the bed was 140cm large, which is definitely too small
the hotel was a bit too far from the center, the closest underground was 15 minutes by foot",4,2015,11,23
103,Will stay again and again!,"I would stay with them just for their great service. Also the room was great. We got a free upgrade to a suit room, which is very spacious (compared to the Radisson Blu Grafton). The room is clean and they have heated floor in the bathroom. The station is nearby and there are many restaurants to eat even during late hours.",5,2015,11,23
103,Shopping trip,My daughter and I Enjoyed our stay. Room was clean and very comfortable the staff were obliging at all times. Loved having a fridge and wine glasses...breakfast was busy but our needs were met. Thank you a little out of the way but just a 15 minute tube on the bakerloo line to to Piccadilly and lovely places to eat near by.,5,2015,11,22
103,"Neat Rooms , Great Service","I was there for 2 days this November.

The rooms were tiny but neat. You have the basic table and bed and wardrobe. 
But have to mention that the room was very neat and it helps as they have non smoking rooms.

Getting to the room was like walking through a maze , I found it amusing .
What stands out is the service and assistance provided by the staff.
I had breakfast there on both the days there and was very happy with the spread and the service .
I would definitely go back to the hotel on my next visit.

The Hyde park is a 10 minute walk and its the best place to visit in the mornings .
The padding station is also 10 minutes walk . 
There are restaurants on the way fro the station to the hotel . 
Lebanese, Italian Indian etc ...

Note : This property was formerly called the best western paddington.",4,2015,11,22
103,Amazing week,"We had a very lovely week in that hotel, from the person who open the door for you to the reception and the restaurant, really nice and welcoming staff.
Many thanks to all the team!
We still eat at the restaurant sometime with the wonderful bartender, Georgiana.

103,The perfect hotel for visitors to London.,"The Park Grand has it all.  Modern comforts right close to the heart of London at a very reasonable price.  We were blown away by the elegance of our double room;  the sparkling bathroom, the super-comfortable beds and the beautiful bedlinen really made it a home from home...  On top of that, we loved the friendliness and efficiency of the staff, and the very reasonable price per night we were quoted.  Breakfasts are brilliant, and what other hotel provides a bowl of chocolates in reception to take up to bed with you!  Fabulous.",5,2015,11,20
103,Newly renovated rooms,"Originally we booked another hotel,but due to water damage, we were transferred to the Park Grand. The location is great, right next to the Hyde Park. Rooms are newly renovated but very tiny (as usual in most London Hotels).  Very friendly and helpful staff. Good breakfast selection, not so easy with baby pram.",4,2015,11,17
103,Amazing hospitality,The rooms after are really nice and comfortable. The hospitality is amazing....one really feels at home.  The location is superb....Paddington station is just a few minutes walk...very close to Oxford street.,5,2015,11,17
103,Good value for money,"The hotel is located 5-10 min. walk from Paddington station, so if you are coming from Heathrow airport you can easily  use Heathrow express. Also there is Paddington tube or Lancaster Gate tube station which is also 5-10 min. walking.
The hotel itself is very nice, the room is small but we knew it from previous reviews, and it was defiantly enough for us (a couple with 2 large suitcases). The room is cozy and nicely decorated. The shower was good with hot water, the only thing is that there is very little space near the sink to put our personal staff (toothbrushes, crème etc.), but this is negligible. The breakfast is varied: cereals, fruits, vegetables, cheeses, sausages, eggs and more. Friendly staff.
Recommended.",5,2015,11,16
103,Best stay in London yet!,"We booked here last minute and was amazed! We booked a compact double room and it was beautiful! It does what it says on the tin however you also get:
Great service
Spotless clean rooms
Great location

When I booked I let them know it was my partners birthday so not long after we had checked in and been shown to our room the doorbell rang. Someone came in with chocolates and a free bottle of wine! Around an hour later we received a telephone call to check everything was okay with the room; which was also a lovely touch.
Breakfast was beautiful, no complaints at all. 
On our last day when we checked out they kept our bags for no charge which we collected around 17:30. 

Overall our stay couldn't have been any better, the room was clean and comfortable! ",5,2015,11,15
103,"Lovely hotel, clean, compact and comfortable.","Great location for working in central London. Friendly, professional staff, warm atmosphere in a smart hotel.
Rooms are comfortable, clean and have the added benefit of a fridge, also the shower is hot and there is FREE Wifi!!!!.
Parking is available on the road 6:30pm-8:30am",5,2015,11,15
103,"Good location, good hotel, speed up checkin","A little over a 5 minute walk from Paddington. Away from the hustle and bustle a little which is good. One night business trip.
I had room 532 in other building which was well equipped, clean and comfortable. Yes bathroom a little small but not a problem, and everything worked and was clean/cared for. Even had a microwave!
It was busy when I checked in. Two people on desk who were doing a great job and with a smile however queue was slow... Observation was that the process/tools/questions show stuff down coupled to a complex checkin for a lady in front. A niggle only, but make it simpler for staff and customers if you can.. Others do.

Looking forward to going back.",4,2015,11,13
103,Good location & service,"Rooms are quite small , so be aware of what you are getting into before booking rooms . I stayed at the second category which was good enough for 1 person . So I will not recommend the first 2 categories for families and not even for couples . Staff are quite friendly even though my reservation was messed up initially . Breakfast was very good and the staff quite friendly and welcoming .",4,2015,11,13
103,Vacation,"Great little hotel, staff were friendly . Handy to transport being halfway between Paddington station and Lancaster gate so easy to travel around. Very close to Hyde Park for a relaxing stroll. Room was compact but had everything you needed and amenities were good, we stayed at the rear of the hotel in a club room and it was surprisingly quiet ",4,2015,11,11
103,Excellent hotel!,"My room had been recently renovated in the modern style. The exterior is more Victorian  but the 2 styles work. Rooms are small by American standards, but typical for Europe. The staff is extremely friendly and eager to help. The location is perfect, close to Paddington Station and Hyde Park. I will highly recommend this hotel to friends and family traveling to London.",5,2015,11,10
103,Very good hotel for Indian clients,"I was there during WTM events, i had very good time during my stay with this hotel. Rooms very clean and staffs are very friendly. Breakfast also very good. Especially Ms Sara was very helpful. Thank you and see you again.",5,2015,11,10
103,High Quality accommodation at excellent price,"Room was fairly compact but of a very high standard - the number and quality of amenities and supplies in the room was excellent. Quiet and extremely comfortable, ideal for an overnight business stay in London.",5,2015,11,07
103,Very comfortable hotel in quiet area,"The hotel is not large but the facilities absolutely fine for a brief stay. If you want a pool, big restaurant etc you need to find somewhere else. Check in was easy all staff friendly and helpful. Our room was next to the lift which was a little noisy and looked out onto another part of the hotel but inside it was clean and well maintained. The bed was big and very comfortable. A good quality wall mounted tv, microwave, fridge. There was complimentary fruit, wine & soft drinks too. A large shower witness fall style ceiling mounted shower head. The bathroom even had underfloor heating. Breakfast was very good quality with plenty of choice. My wife had room service steak & chips, which was quick, tasty and reasonably priced. The hotel is fairly equidistant between Lancaster Gate and Paddington Tube stations within 5-7 minutes walk. We had a lovely walk through Hyde Park to the Albert Hall and the museums. ",4,2015,11,02
103,Lovely hotel,"The hotel is in an excellent location and is very quiet.  Recently decorated with good amenities.  The mattress and pillows were very comfortable.  My only complaint would be that our double room was tiny, we couldn't walk round to the far side of the bed.",4,2015,11,01
103,Overpriced,"The good things:
Helpful staff, recently decorated, free wifi, free newspapers. Close to Paddington.
The average things:
Breakfast ok but not exceptional, public areas small.
Not so good
Really really really small bedrooms. We paid for an upgrade to de luxe and we could barely walk around the bed. The size of rooms on the site seems to include the bathroom.
Overall if the hotel were cheaper it would have been satisfactory. It was almost £500 for 3 nights and really wasn't worth that. I have certainly stayed in better.",3,2015,10,31
103,Amazing mini break,"I have just returned from a two night stay at the Grand Park Paddington, I was actually booked into a different hotel but a great deal came up on booking.com and I am so glad I made the decision to swap to this hotel.
Upon reaching the hotel which is only 5 mins from the underground, we were greeted by concierge who kindly opened all doors for us, check in was quick and simple, then we were escorted across the road to a separate building where our deluxe double room was.
Our room was lovely and clean, had excellent facilities, a good sized fridge, even a microwave! It was rather warm but I quickly located the temp control and reduced it to my liking. The bathroom was small but modern and clean so I have no complaints. My only comments about the room and this is no way a criticism is I am not used to a double bed so if I was to stay again I would book a bigger bed ;).
As we checked in we were offered the chance to include full cooked brekkie for £12 a person which I felt was reasonable so agreed and I am glad I did, it was varied in choice and fresh tea and coffee was served, it's available from 7-10 which I felt was very reasonable to suit all.
Upon return to our room day 1, I was greeted by petals on my bed, swans made from towels, wine, chocolates and cake.. I remembered the day earlier the concierge asked why we were visiting London and it was for my 30th so he must have advised the hotel and I thought that was a beautiful touch and a really nice surprise to come back too after a day in the city so thank you for making my day that little bit more special ;)
The location of the hotel is great, with Hyde park just at the end of the road and local restaurants serving late into the evening.
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would recommend highly.",5,2015,10,29
103,Great spot for a few nights in London,"The Park Grand Paddington Court hotel is a great place to spend a few nights in London. Their staff are excellent and proactive in seeking to help in any way they can. The restaurant and bar do a good breakfast (£12 if booked the night before) and dinner. The rooms are clean and well decorated, the only downside is that they are quite small however that is normal for the area and price range. The location is great for a short stay in London, near Hyde Park and Paddington Station-Heathrow Express.",4,2015,10,29
103,Can't fault this place,"A great find!  Convenient for Paddington Station but on a quiet side street close to Regent's Park.  The room was compact but had everything we needed.  It was immaculately clean and newly refurbished.  Beds were excellent, lovely bathroom, tea/coffee, tv, hairdryer, free wifi.  But it was the extras that set this hotel apart:  free bottled water and a mini fridge, fresh apples in the room and at reception and most importantly the service was outstanding.  Staff were so friendly and helpful in particular the guy in reception who went out of his way to look after us, providing maps, directions etc and a warm welcoming smile whenever we saw him.  For me, this turns an ordinary stay in a hotel into a far more pleasurable experience.  Excellent value for money in London - highly recommended.",5,2015,10,29
103,Lovely hotel!,"I recently visited Park Grand Paddington and was really impressed by the hotel! All the staff were really friendly and attentive, and everywhere was extremely clean! The room was lovely, exactly how it was pictured on the website and the bed was really comfortable. My only complaint would be that outside our room was the air conditioning unit which was extremely noisy at night time. But I would definitely visit the hotel again and I totally recommend it!! ",4,2015,10,28
103,Excellent,"Very lovely hotel ideally situated near to Paddington station and Paddington underground stop.
We stayed here for a birthday treat for my girlfriend and I gave the hotel notice of this and they laid on a very special treat of, love swan towels laid on the bed with rose petals scattered too, and they put out a lovely bottle of red wine and a slice of gorgeous chocolate cake! 
The hotel itself it's really nice, very clean and tidy, we had breakfast both mornings and that was sensational! Cooked buffet and a choice of cereals and toast tea/coffee and juices.
The staff are friendly and helpful too.
All in all a good stay and no complaints at all.",5,2015,10,28
103,Exceeded expectation,"Pleasantly surprised, lovely room, nice touches and great breakfast...staff helpful and good location.Would highly recommend to those wishing to be close to Paddington and Hyde Park...normally am hard to please but would definitely return.",5,2015,10,26
103,Great weekend stay,"The Park Grand felt luxurious and the room was modern, very clean and comfortable. We especially loved the heated floors in the bathroom!

We only went to the restaurant for the breakfast buffet each morning. The breakfast was convenient and included pastries, fruit, cereal, eggs, ham, etc. We received free breakfast because we were bumped from another hotel, but it probably wasn't worth the value otherwise.

The location is perfect if you are coming from Heathrow. It's just a 5-minute walk to Paddington Station, where you can catch the Heathrow Express train (15 minutes to the airport). It was also a short walk to Hyde Park and the tour bus we took around the city. 

Overall, the service was great and the staff were friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are traveling as a tourist or for business.",5,2015,10,26
103,A delightful stay in our Capitol City,"Helpful and friendly staff throughout our stay. The hotel was a short walk from Paddington Station, but just far enough away so that it was not in a noisy area. The rooms, whilst not large were a reasonable size. The decor was good and both our rooms (a twin and a double) were clean and tidy. The beds were so comfortable that I wish I could have brought it home. Their breakfast was good with a choice of a full English, yoghurt and fruit or cereal.",5,2015,10,23
103,Perfect city hotel,A spacious and clean room in a nice and central area. Paddington Station within walking distance. Plenty of nice restaurants in the neighborhood. Tea and coffee in the room. Free wifi. Excellent breakfast buffet with friendly wait staff.,4,2015,10,21
103,Pleasant surprise,"Room: very good, had a compact double on my own,,as a single it was perfect but if you are two maybe very small,,
Service; excellent, speedy check-in
Breakfast,,,Disappointment,, very small and crowded,no sallad or green vegetables, little boring but the girls did as good as possible",4,2015,10,21
103,A delightful stay in London,"Greeted nicely at check in.  Staff was very helpful with things to do and see around the hotel and any other questions that we had.  Room was small, but clean, modern and quiet. So much quality for the money.  Breakfast was wonderful every morning, full English breakfast.  This hotel has been recently remodeled and was a wonderful experience to stay in.  The location was great for us, tube stations, express to the airport, etc.  There were some very nice restaurants and stores around which made it a pleasant stay.  Park Grand Paddington Court, thank you !",5,2015,10,20
103,Great Stay,"We stayed in London for our anniversary. After knowing this They welcomed us by decorating our bed with rose petals and folded towels. It has been a very nice surprise.
Comfortable and quite room. Very very clean! 
 The hotel staff was so kind and professional and very friendly. They were looking at every tiny details we needed.
we really enjoyed the stay.",5,2015,10,16
103,Great Stay!,"Smaller rooms, but that's London for you. Since this was for a layover for my honeymoon, they decorated our bed and bathroom with rose petals and folded towels. And they had a great breakfast buffet! Overall, nice room, friendly staff and an enjoyable stay!",5,2015,10,15
103,"Amazing, comfortable & functional","I really enjoyed the stay in London, the hotel service was so kind and professional, they are looking at every tiny details you need.
Comfortable room. super clean! Quite room with a London morning view.
The crew welcomed us very generously with excellent service.
We haven't used the dinning room because we ate outside our schedule choice.

Very Recommanded AAA+++
",5,2015,10,15
103,Very nice but needs attention,Small room only just big enough for the single bed. Not really a problem but a bit of a squeeze. Room was in principal well-cleaned but obviously had been empty for a few days as there was a fine layer of dust on everything. One lightswitch broken. Annoying loud electrical hum from something in the ceiling.,3,2015,10,13
103,"Friendly staff, great price, good find","Booked online with fear as always wary of London hotels = small, dilapidated & noisy if 'affordable'...Showed up to a 1month ago refurbished, spacious & modern hotel. Quiet. Comp. 1/2 bottle wine & fruit, turn down service & v. nice breakfast. Really impressed.
Only hiccup was showing up to the hotel we booked, but were told as a flexi booking, we had been moved...alarmed at first but we were escorted (bags carried) to this other building 3mins away. So just be aware of that on their website's 'special offers' & familiarise yourself with a good map to find it!",5,2015,10,13
103,lovely stay,"my husband myself and my grandson stayed for two nights on 9th and 10th of october and had a lovely room staff were really lovely and couldnt do enough for us even when my grandson wanted to put batteries in a car he had bought and we didnt have a screwdriver,they sent a maintenance man to do it there was no need to do that but they did so thank you for that.the only downfall was my husband left his glasses on the table at breakfast and nobody knew where they were'but a great time we had room was lovely and quiet.",4,2015,10,12
103,Lovely Hoyle ,This hotel is lovely. Rooms are spacious for London. Staff are helpful. Lizzi the manager was brilliant and solved a couple of issues we had which were not major but we're treated with the same concern. Breakfast was good and the overall stay is highly recommendable. We will be staying again soon!! ,4,2015,10,12
103,Personalised service all round,"I stayed at the hotel for two nights on business.  It's a few minutes walk from the station which is ideal and situated on a quiet London street.  The hotel is spotlessly clean throughout.  What made my stay was the personal approach all of the staff gave from the moment I arrived having my suitcase carried up to my room, nothing was too much trouble.  Whenever any member of staff passed me or saw me I was asked how I was and noticed every guest was treated the same way, which was lovely.  They took pride in getting to know people and I saw this particularly in the bar when a disabled guest arrived back from their day out.   The only downside was that my room was above the bar/café area so the background music could be heard quite loudly.  I raised this with staff and was immediately offered an alternative room which was lovely.  The next day, I noticed that no music was being played and this would certainly benefit anyone staying on the first floor rooms who want a little bit of peace and quiet.  Music is such a personal choice.....thank you to all of the staff for making my stay all the much better.",5,2015,10,11
103,Great stay Great Location,"We wanted a hotel close to the underground and bus routes and it was with walking distance. The hotel was close to Paddington Station and walking to it we found lots of restaurants and shops for room supplies i.e. wine and beer.  We were also close to Hyde Park which was nice to go to for a walk etc.   The hotel was in a great location, well equipped, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2015,10,08
103,Overwhelming Stay,"Conveniently located in London's centre and easy access to the transport links as well as London's main attractions.
we stayed overnight in this hotel in the Club Suite for our anniversary and were pleased by the hospitality of the hotel staff.
Definitely recommend this hotel, and special services provided by Vinayak and Savio.
Would love to come back to this hotel in future.",5,2015,10,08
103,Conveniently located,"Conveniently located hotel, good for a run in Hyde park and for getting there from the Heathrow Express. Two separate buildings, safe and quiet neighborhood and not overly expensive (for London standards). ",4,2015,10,07
103,Exeptional value for money,"We usually stay at the Thistle Marble Arch for theatre breaks, but as on this occasion the Thistle was a bit expensive we took the plunge to try somewhere new!
The ""Boutique"" style of hotel is something we have not come across before, but found our first experience here fantastic.
A welcome greet with an easy check in. We was initially allocated a standard room, that was to say the least, compact! We had a defect in the room and was upgraded to a club room. A nice warm décor, spotlessly clean and ideal for our 2 day stay.
Drinks and small snacks in the room was very welcome, a nice touch that big brand hotels could do to improve their experience.
Had a wonderful traditional afternoon tea and the breakfast was superb. Only slight issue was a waitress that did not understand English.
Will be looking to book here on all our theatre visits in the future!",5,2015,10,05
103,Business Trip to Lord's Cricket Ground,"Great little hotel, lovely rooms and very friendly staff. Ideally located for the cricket and a really nice busy suburb of London in Paddington full of bars and restaurants. 5 minutes walk from Paddington Tube station makes it an even more appealing location.",4,2015,10,05
103,Lovely Hotel In A Great Location,"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel and found it to be one of the best experiences we have had while visiting London. The service is superb and breakfast was over the top.
Our room was quite and looked out over a small park. We felt safe and comfortable here.
Very good location close  Lancaster Gate Underground station and many bus lines.
Kensington Garden",5,2015,10,04
103,Excellent,"Highly recommend the Park Grand Paddington!!!  We had a few issues with our room, I talked to Ruxi left for the day, when my wife and I returned all was taken care of and a bottle of wine and a fruit basket was there for our inconvenience!!!!  Ruxi went way out of her way to take care of us, never meet her before our stay and when we go back I hope to see her again!!!  Very good location to buses and trains.  Hotel was very well kept.  Can't wait to go back, George",5,2015,10,04
103,"Amazing hotel, friendly staff, beautiful rooms.","The staff made out stay so special as it was for my birthday. On arrival Ruxi offered us complimentary breakfast, told us where to park and was so lovely. The porter who helped us up with our bags (not sure of his name) was so nice too, and very friendly. The staff made our weekend in London so much better. Thank you so much, we are very grateful for all you did :) ",5,2015,10,04
103,Everything was great!,"Location was very good, close to the train station, many restaurants and bars near the hotel. The rooms are clean and nice and the hotel staff is very nice and courteous. We would like to praise the receptionist Roxy took care of us and was available for questions. Highly recommended...",5,2015,10,02
103,Wanted to love it - but couldn't sleep!,"Like other reviewers, we actually booked the Park Grand Lancaster Gate (based on TA reviews!)  When we arrived from Heathrow to Paddington Station it was absolutely pouring.  We were soaked when we inadvertently walked into the PG Paddington Court (walked into the 1st Park Grand we saw - had no idea there were so many close by).  The reception staff were very friendly and said because we booked the flexi-stay (??) we could stay at Paddington Court. We were completely confused - I know they were trying to be accommodating, but .... huh?   Had it not been pouring out, we probably would have asked to go to our original hotel.  But we decided to stay at Paddington Court.  We were there before normal arrival time and they had a room ready for us within 20 minutes.

Pros:
- Location - close to Lancaster Gate tube station, Paddington Station and Hyde Park. Seemed like a safe neighborhood.
- Very clean
- Good HVAC - kept room nice and cool for us.
- Under-floor heating in bathroom (just don't leave on too long - ouch!)
- Nice people - especially the female bartender in the lounge, she was sweet (unfortunately didn't catch her name!)
- Decent breakfast (good selection, although the staff is a bit too eager to take your plate - I felt like I was being stalked!)

Cons:
- Don't pay more for a club room.  Not worth the extra - didn't notice any difference
- Size of room - I expect hotel rooms in large cities to be on the smaller size, but this was too small for my husband and I and our suitcases.  We bumped into each other regularly.  No real chair to sit down in.  No place to open suitcases but on bed.  Bathroom was reminiscent of a cruise ship stateroom bathroom.  And no counter space to put toiletries on.
- Noise level.  Wow.  We heard EVERYTHING in the room next to us (yes, room 306 - everything).  And I swear the people in the room above us had a large dance troupe performing nightly.  Or a herd of elephants. How could you possibly walk that much in such a tiny room? Plus we were close to the elevator so we heard that, people talking, the fire doors slamming.  Everything.  And this was over and above the white noise app on my phone that I use to drown out noise.  It was useless.  We were lucky to get 2-3 hours of sleep a night.

These last 2 reasons lead to the lower rating - if I can't sleep, I can't rate you highly.  That's kind of what a hotel room is for.",3,2015,09,30
103,Nice Clean and Friendly,Stayed here on an overnight trip. Hotel is nice and clean and the staff was very friendly. Hotel is a convenient 5 min walk from Paddington Station so easy to get around London. Only downfall was that the hotel bar close quit early so no night cap when you get back to the hotel after being out in the city. Breakfast was very good and cheap enough when booked for in advance. Overall nice hotel.,5,2015,09,30
103,A VERY NICE PLACE IN THE HEART OF LONDON,"When you travel on a budget, it is important to choose the perfect location. you can find offerings of low rate places, bigger rooms and/or other amenities; but it is important to note that in cities like London, location is everything. Park Grand Paddington Court offers precisely this: modern rooms, cleanliness, excellent breakfast; but, above all, you are 5 minutes from Paddington Station, which means easy conection to Heathrow Airport and the main tube lines to go around the city. if weather allows it, you can easily walk all the parks, an excellent way to exercise and to be sorrounded by the most beautiful places in a big city like this",4,2015,09,29
103,"Good Location , nice and new rooms","The hotel location is great , short walk from Paddington station . the room are new decorated and very nice . my room which was on the 1st floor was very small . but it serve my trip (business ).

The small  rooms are not suitable for couples. Some access to some of the back room is without an elevators . overall it is a good hotel , very good location . breakfast is very good , lot of selection.",4,2015,09,29
103,Quick vacation for one,The hotel was near the Paddington Station which provided easy access to the tube and rail. Also the hotel was not located on a major road which provided a fairly quick stay for London.  The single room was perfect for me as I was traveling by myself.  I was very pleased with the room and staff.,4,2015,09,29
103,Friendliest hotel in town,"We stayed three nights here in September. Originally we were booked into the Park Grand Lancaster Gate but the rooms were tiny (normal for London). However there was a bigger room available here. The staff at the hotel are the friendliest I have come across in a long time. Each time we left we were told to enjoy our day/night and on return we were asked if it was a good day/night. It does make a difference to feel valued. Breakfast was good but  crowded at peak times as is normal, again the staff were so good and hard working (not a mobile phone in sight). We will be back",5,2015,09,28
103,Short stay at London,"Very nice place, perfectly located, clean and quite; we had also breakfast for free and the lady that served as at the end was very helpful (her name was Tima). 
We could also use the printer for free.",5,2015,09,28
103,"Good location, nice room","I had booked at the sister hotel nearby, The Park Grand Paddington, but it was overbooked and I was transferred to the Court. They upgraded me to a better room and it was very nice albeit on the small side, as any other hotel room in London. It looked brand new and had everything I needed, a comfy bed, shaving kit, a nice shower, fruit and even a small bottle of wine. The breakfast buffet was good. best of all is the location in the center of Paddington near the train station.",3,2015,09,24
103,Fantastic hotel!,"Excellent hotel, very pleasantly surprised,
Attentive staff, good food, surprise waiting in our room for our anniversary and yet we only booked the room 30 minutes before arrival! We booked a club room,
IMMACULATE room... Cleaners are doing a fantastic job, every tiny piece of chrome is highly polished, modern furnishings, warm, cosy, only slight thing is the rooms aren't very well sound insulated but the look and feel of the room made me forget!",5,2015,09,23
103,Everyone was really helpful,"-Was given an upgrade, which was appreciated it.
-Location was great, walking distance to 2 major underground stations. There were many cafes, restaurants and grocery stores nearby.
- Internet was excellent",4,2015,09,22
103,Lovely Hotel and staff / Ideal Location,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel 9/6-9/9.  The Park Grand Padding Court is a really nice hotel with an amazing staff, especially Cynann, who was working at the reception desk.  Our original room was a bit smaller than we expected and she immediately transferred us to a nicer/larger room.  She was extremely professional and nice!  The rooms and property are kept very clean.  We had breakfast included with our stay and the food was excellent.  The location of the hotel was ideal.  It was a very short two block walk to the Lancaster gate train station.  There are two restaurants on the way to the train station that I would recommend.  Taormina Italian restaurant, which had fantastic dessert and the Mitre, which is a traditional British pub. I would definitely stay at this hotel again",5,2015,09,22
103,Good value convenient hotel,"Visited for 2 nights staying in a double deluxe with breakfast included.

Hotel: 8-10 min walk from both Lancaster Gate and Paddington underground stops. 10 min walk to Hyde Park. Hotel is modern and clean,  very nice. Nice bar/lounge area .Surrounding street is nice. Bikes available outside front door. There is a pharmacy and small supermarket less than 1 min walk from hotel.

Room: Quite small size but this is London. Large tv opposite bed.  There are a safe, kettlle, fridge and a hairdrier in the room. Room is cleaned daily and fresh towels provided. Free wifi in room.  Only bad point for me was the doors to rooms slam quite loud so if people are inconsiderate coming in late at night you can hear it quite clear - we were in the room furthest at end of corridor too, however I appreciate this happens in most hotels

Breakfast: Very good. Self service buffet. Hot - sausage, bacon, eggs, beans, potatoes, toast. Cold - fruits, cereals, yoghurt. Croissants and baked goods also. Tea/coffee/juice. All good standard.

Staff: Friendly, in particularly the guys who welcome you at the front door.

Would recommend and would return",5,2015,09,20
103,Excellent hotel,"The hotel has an excellent service and is located in a good area.The staff is quite friendly and professional. When you check-in there, a concierge takes good care of you. Facilities in one's room are explained well. The price for a room is reasonable.",5,2015,09,19
103,excellent,"the room was beyond our expectations, the crew was very helpful and nice, the location was great. we enjoyed every moment!
the hotel is only five minute walk from Paddignton station, hide park and other attractions. very easy to find.",5,2015,09,19
103,Business Trip,"The quality of service was excellent.  The room was very comfortable with an excellent standard of cleanliness. The breakfast was very good quality and with a wide range to suit all tastes.  In particular, the staff were very helpful and efficient and went beyond the call of duty to help.  One even lent me a personal phone charger when I realised I had forgotten to bring one.",5,2015,09,17
103,Excellent Hotel,"Amazing staff, they helped us in every situation, from information about places to visit to details regardin transport.

The location of the hotel is next to Paddington station, which makes transportation very easy.

The rooms are very nice and always cleaned on time.

",5,2015,09,16
103,Great value for money!,"We booked this hotel through late rooms for our 2 night break and found it to be excellent value for money. It's location was perfect for the concert in Hyde Park that we were going to and it's also very conveniently situated for all of the London Transport links, tube, bus, overground etc. There is also a bicycle station right outside the door if you want to hire one of the London bikes to get around on. Having been recently refurbished, the hotel is decorated tastefully and to a high standard. We booked a club room, which was definitely on the small side. However, we didn't plan on spending much time in it other than to sleep, so size wasn't a problem for us. The bed was super comfy and the crisp white cotton sheets beautifully laundered. There was complimentary wine, fruit, soft drinks, tea making facilities, toiletries, robes and slippers all in the room, which was incidentally spotlessly clean. The en suite was modern and everything that you needed. A nice touch was the lovely fresh flowers throughout the hotel and in bud vases on the breakfast tables. The breakfast itself is buffet style and consisted of the standard full English items, as well as cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurts, pastries, speciality breads, toast and preserves. We would definitely book this hotel again as it offers excellent value for money. The staff were all very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The only small criticisms are that our booking included breakfast but they had it on their system as room only. This was quickly rectified and didn't cause any major problem. Also, on the Sunday morning there was a queue for tables at breakfast, but again this wasn't a big deal and we only waited for about 5 minutes to be seated.",5,2015,09,15
103,"Lovely hotel, great location","Lovely hotel with staff to match, friendly, helpful and all with a wonderful smile!  Excellent value, bedroom not the largest, (not that it was an issue for us, as we had a full on weekend, Proms in the Park etc.) but has everything you need, plus a very nice bathroom. Spotlessly clean hotel. And breakfast was cooked to perfection.
A big thank you to all the staff for making our stay relaxing and enjoyable, looking forward to our next trip to London and staying here again.",5,2015,09,15
103,Overnight stay,"Booked this hotel as was attending concert in nearby Hyde Park. Located on a quiet side street but easy walking distance to local tube stations and Hyde Park. Both check in and check out was handled efficiently and ALL staff members from reception to cleaning staff were friendly and greeted us with a smile. There were fresh flowers in the corridors and fresh fruit, complimentary water in the room.

The room, whilst not huge was spotlessly clean and very well appointed. More than adequate for our needs.  Breakfast was included in our room rate and was varied and we'll presented.  Staff again was friendly and welcoming.  If you are looking for an overnight stay in the Capital you could do worse than stay here.",4,2015,09,15
103,Value - despite some dubious advertising.,"We booked online at the Park Grand Lancaster Gate - on arrival we were advised 'because you booked ""flexible online"" we have moved you to another hotel' - its just around the corner and has just been renovated. Slightly bizarre !
So off we went to our new hotel - Park Grand Paddington Court - and yes all new and shiny.
First impressions very good - the staff excellent.
We booked a Club Room - which offers a larger room and access to the 'club lounge' including snacks and drinks in the evening - well that's stretching the reality. The Club Lounge is the same lounge that is open to all guests - and the 'snacks' are a cheese sandwich which they will make on request.
The Club part is just a bit of advertising - if u are thinking its the same as the Hilton's Executive Lounge - its not !
The Club room was a normal size room - the standard room must be very small.
Having been recently refurbished we were surprised to find some strange design features - the toilet is about 9 inches higher off the floor than the 'standard' so u find yourself balanced on tip toe whilst maintaining position. The bathroom does not have a towel rail, also inadequate shelving for the necessary bits and pieces but yet there is plenty of unused space. Its as though someone changed plans half way through.
The breakfasts are good and the location is excellent. 
I don't think they need to push the non existent Club Room benefits - rather focus on the excellent value ( for London ) that they do offer.",4,2015,09,14
103,Our trip to Hyde park for the proms..,"Lovely hotel lovely staff !! A really nice hotel close to Hyde park and transport links the rooms are not large but have everything you need and are very clean, the staff always have a smile for you and are very attentive would definitely stay here again..",5,2015,09,14
103,"Good hotel, good location.","A very nice hotel, in a convenient location. The staff were excellent, nothing too much trouble and a friendly attitude. We stayed in a club room, which was very nice and good value for money. If I had to be picky the bathroom was a little small, but not really an issue. The whole experience was good and would recommend this hotel for a stay.",4,2015,09,14
103,short and sweet,"Nice hotel, was expecting a little more for the price paid but clean, spacious twin room.
Breakfast, quality of products lacking for this kind of hotel even though large choice offered. staff helpful.",4,2015,09,14
103,Good hotel,Good location. Staff very helpful and friendly. Breakfast room small for size of hotel but food really good. Would definitely stay here again. Many thanks to the staff. Only gripe was the hotel bar closed at 11pm so after the Hyde park proms and walk back we couldn't have a night cap. ,4,2015,09,14
103,Lovely hotel enjoyed for our first Proms in the Park,"This is a lovely hotel in a good location for Hyde Park and all of Central London.
The room was compact but had everything we needed, very clean and modern.  The fittings in the bathroom were of a good standard, lovely shower and the bed was very comfortable.
The staff were very helpful and friendly and did everything to ensure that our stay was a pleasant experience.
Breakfast was good too.",5,2015,09,13
103,Great hotel,"Nice modern hotel, staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful, clean small room but ok for 1 person, breakfast was good not a bad choice of food, good location  5-10min walk to Paddington station.",4,2015,09,12
103,Birthday Stay,"We stayed as an extended family group for my step daughters birthday visit to London. The rooms are well appointed with nice bathrooms but this being London they are very small. Our 3 rooms were classed as deluxe, we saw no others so couldn't compare. The room service we had was slow but polite however we requested drinks we didn't get which we think got lost in translation,
We didn't have breakfast due to a lunch appointment.",3,2015,09,11
103,"Reliable, convenient, and friendly.","We've stayed here thrice, and each time has been consistently good. In a really convenient location close to Paddington station (obviously) and Lancaster Gate underground on the Central Line, the staff were friendly and helpful throughout. The facilities are new and in great condition, and the bed was comfortable too. The food (breakfast and the fish and chips) were tasty and fresh.
Would recommend to all.",5,2015,09,10
103,"Great, modern hotel!","We were transferred from Grand Royale London Hyde Park to this hotel due to some unplanned renovations. Since we didn't know what to expect, we were a little worried, but the service was excellent and the rooms are newly renovated and really nice! They also have multi country-outlets, and also a USB outlet. The staff overall are really nice and service minded. We did not hear our neighbors through the walls or doors. The only negative things are the strong scent in the hallways, from some ""smell good""-device on the wall, and that our view was towards an alley. The hotel is located at walking distance from Lancaster Gate, Queensway and Bayswater, which means great transportation possibilities.",4,2015,09,10
103,Pleasant hotel in good location,"Recently stayed at Paddington Court hotel. The staff on my arrival were extremely friendly and took time to go through the map of the area to give me bearings of where I needed to go. 
The room was a very compact single, but clean and the bed was comfy and I wasn't disturbed by any noise outside - which is rare as I'm a light sleeper!
For anyone who needs to use a hairdryer in the morning I would suggest you take your own as the one in the room cuts out when it gets too hot! 
The breakfast was good - the usual buffet selection of cereals, pastries, fruit, meat & cheese or a full English. The downside is that the tables are very close to each other so you feel as if you can join in with the next tables conversation - bit too cosy for my liking!
Overall a pleasant stay and I would book to stay here again.",4,2015,09,10
103,Great Service!,"We booked for one night which was our wedding anniversary. the hotel did not know this and it just happened to be mentioned to Alexandra at reception when we were checking in. She asked us to wait in the lounge for 10 minutes as our room was not ready. Our luggage was taken to our room and we were then informed we had been upgraded to a Club room. When we were taken there the room had been specially prepared (rose petals on the bed, towels in the shape of two swans, etc). and we had been given half a bottle of wine some fruit and some cheesecake together with a very nice card. We are a mature couple and we were absolutely bowled over by this. Congratulations to Alexandra and the reception staff. The hotel anyway was spotlessly clean, very comfortable and in a very good location. We shall certainly use it again and recommend it to others",5,2015,09,08
103,Great Hotel with wonderful staff,"Really enjoyed my stay for comfort, cleanliness and friendly  My only real problem was the very poor wi-fi  As i was travelling on business it was diappointing not to be able to work on my emails etc due to poor wi-fi",4,2015,09,07
103,"Convenient, good value","This hotel is one of a group and the accommodation is on the whole very good, with good sized rooms, excellent cleanliness with helpful staff and good breakfast. For travel and business it's close to national rail and tube links, easy to book etc. On one occasion a mix up occurred and I was transferred to their apartments across the road, with no fuss and no charge. In London, hotels vary hugely in cost and quality, this is reasonable value, relative to budget of course, as London rates go, and is usually a safe bet. I've stayed more than once with absolutely no problems.",4,2015,09,05
103,Hidden Gem,"From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the warmest smiles ever. The location is great, just 5 minutes walk from Hyde Park and Paddington Station. The hotel is newly redecorated and has a very classy look. The room are standard London size but offer you all the comfort that you need. The greatest feature I must say is the incredibly helpful staff. They make you feel more welcomed that you would be in your own home. Will definately return soon.
Huge thanks once again for all the staff members especially Ruxi who went above and beyond with everything and all the girls in the reception.",5,2015,09,03
103,Nice Hotel In A Good Location,"I came to London on a business trip and was very pleased with the accommodation at Park Grand Hotel. The room was very modern, clean and had great facilities including a small fridge and microwave.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and the breakfast was delicious. I would not hesitate to book at this hotel again in the future.",5,2015,09,02
103,Lovely room and service,"Stayed here (at the Grand around the corner form the main entrance) and loved it. The room was lovely and clean and had nice touches like plenty of complimentary fruit and even a small bottle of wine in the room. Was very impressed and with the breakfast which was very good it offered great value, especially for this part of London. Staff were always very helpful and polite. Can't recommend enough especially for this part of London. The only thing i would add is that as this is an old building it has lots of stairs so if this is an issue ask for a room nearer the lift and with easier access.",5,2015,08,31
103,good,"Small rooms had a twin and a double for our stay.
Staff very friendly location easy to get around from.
Good value for money paid £550
For three nights two rooms and four adults in a central location
Free WiFi in both the rooms
Only negative being the size of the rooms",4,2015,08,29
103,Really impressed,"Spent 3 very comfortable nights here with my Son to visit some London attractions. Room compact but impeccably clean. Bathroom very impressive. All staff friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend it if you want clean, smart and comfortable but don't want to spend a fortune. Few minutes walk to Lancaster Gate tube so really accessible.",4,2015,08,26
103,Top hotel for small price.,"The room had everything you could need in it. It was clean and comfortable. We didn't eat there so can not comment on the food. The staff were so obliging nothing was too much trouble. The shower became blocked and it was fixed in seconds amazing. The air conditioning worked a treat. The bed was huge and very comfortable. We asked for an iron and ironing board and again it was there in seconds. Although the hotel was busy the rooms were very quiet and we were never disturbed. The shower and toilet facilities were spotless, clean towels daily and lovely free toiletries. We even had complimentary newspapers, wonderful.",5,2015,08,25
103,Excellent Hotel,"Great location, fantastic staff who couldn't do enough for us, the suite was new and more than comfortable and the food was excellent.In a very competitive marketplace the hotel really does stand out, from the friendliness of the staff, to the exquisite presentation & layout of the hotel itself and then there's the actual location. Ideally suited for Central London, Covent Garden, Hyde Park etcetera.
Highly recommended and we will be going back for more.",5,2015,08,25
103,Great place in the heart of the London,"The hotel is easy to reach - close to Paddington Station, the room I had, was small but everything was there - even a microwave ! It was very clean and I had everything I was needed ! 
Staff is very friendly - I can strongly resommend this place if you spend time in the city.
Thank you !",5,2015,08,25
103,"Average quality, too expensive, good location","We were there for 3 nights for our city trip in London.

Design of the room and comfort of the the bed was good.

The room was located underground of the Hotel, near construction site of the Hotel (probably room renovation of this part of the Hotel)

We had some much noise from outside because of that and it was impossible to let the windows opened because men at work were looking at us so no privacy at all and the view was a disaster.

The hotel should finish his renovations before putting people on this part of the Hotel.

I guess another part of the Hotel could have been a lot better for us and for the expensive price we paid.

The room was also very small comparing to pictures we saw on booking for that particular room.

The staff was nice and helpful but not especially outstanding.

With a bit more luck regarding the room location, it could have been a better stay.

The location of the hotel is nice as you are near circle and central line on foot.

The wifi was good and fast.",3,2015,08,24
103,Amazing ,Me and my husband have just visted this hotel the rooms are clean and nicely decorated the staff are so friendly and helpful there is nothing they won't do for you we told a staff member that we was in London celebrating our wedding anniversary. We unpacked went for a walk and came back to a bottle of wine swan towels and rose petals on the bed it was so lovely. We highly recommend this hotel ,5,2015,08,21
103,Great location and great value,"A very comfortable, modern and clean hotel..  The staff were extremely helpful, great customer service.  This hotel is great value for money and is situated in a lovely quiet location with very easy access to Hyde Park and Central London - Lancaster Gate Underground is just 5 mins walk away.  I shall definitely stay here again.",5,2015,08,21
103,Great find. Affordable. Charming. Excellent service and location.,"Couldn't have been more satisfied. Entered skeptical cause reviews okay but not great. What I found was charming place with very helpful staff. The decor of lobby and cafeteria - where I was invited to the  best cappuccino of my life while waiting for my room - were lovely. Single room small but attractive and adequate, with all amenities and a bargain. Had also it was far from sights and restaurants. Not so. Paddington tube is on several major lines and reasonable tube ride to all museums and restaurants. It's near Hyde park and walking distance in good weather from Kensington palace, Notting hill and Baker St. And very nearby there are quite a few good ethnic restaurants - Italian, Lebanese, Malaysian, Indian open till 11.30 PM. My only doubt is: I booked for grand park Paddington Court at 27 Devonshire and I'm filling out review for Shaftsbury Paddington Court. I want to be sure it's the same hotel!",5,2015,08,20
103,"Quality rooms, friendly staff, good price","I stayed in this hotel for two nights, during the middle of the week for business. I paid £85 for my room including breakfast.
 
I was looking for a hotel which was a good price while still giving a little comfort in the rooms. At the price I paid I was extremely happy with my experience, especially for a central London hotel!
 
I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hotel. It is very nicely decorated and the rooms are well equipped. I booked a deluxe single room. This room was quite small, however there was enough space to move about, get dressed and just generally not feel cramped in the room. The TV in the room was brilliant, large, good quality and has normal Freeview so you don’t have to mess around trying to navigate complex hotel menus. It has good connectivity so you can connect your own laptop using a HDMI cable, which is always good if you want to watch films! The bathroom was again relatively small, but really well decorated. There was underfloor heating and really good quality shower. Other key features with the room include the fridge and microwave, a hair dryer and a very effective and simple to use air conditioning unit.
 
The staff were extremely helpful, throughout check in and during my stay. It was a nice change to have the front door opened for me by the concierge instead of having to struggle all the way to reception before I am greeted.
 
Finally the breakfast was very nice, good choice of cooked items, could do with a little more fruit to choose from but apart from that it was lovely.
 
I would stay here again, and would certainly recommend this to a friend!",5,2015,08,20
103,Great find! ,"We were pleasantly surprised just how great this hotel was for the price! It was a very aesthetically pleasing, clean, comfortable room. The bed was very comfortable and restful. The location is great, just a block from Paddington Station and there were plenty of restaurants in the area. I will be staying here again if ever in London again! ",5,2015,08,18
103,Convenient clean and friendly,Situated close to Paddington Station so useful if you want to drop your bag for your day in the city. Recently smartened up and name change. Really friendly and efficient staff. Short stroll to Hyde Park or 30 min stroll to Oxford Street. Only downside is that rooms are very small.,4,2015,08,15
103,Lovely hotel,We stayed here for a weekend and really enjoyed our stay. The majority of the staff were lovely and the hotel was welcoming airy and very clean. Our room was compact but still lovely with some nice touches toothbrush and toothpaste razor etc. the shower was like a rain forest very refreshing and the breakfast was buffet style but had everything to suit everyone's needs. My partner ordered wine and chocolate as a surprise for me which was a nice touch but the bottle held 2 glasses which in my opinion was a bit overpriced but it is London so it's expected. All in all a great stay and will return,5,2015,08,12
103,Nano rooms,"This hotel has very very tiny rooms. There is no place even to put your luggage. If you are claustrophobic, please avoid this hotel. 

They put me up in room number 323 on the third floor. Much to my dismay there was no lift to this room. How can a 4-star hotel not have a lift to the 3rd floor?

Overall not worth the money. Only advantage is closeness to the Paddington station.",2,2015,08,11
103,Exemplary staff and hotel is of a high standard,"We originally booked for the Park Grand, Lancaster Gate though on arrival we were asked if we wanted to transfer to the Park Grand, Paddington with an upgrade to a larger room and complimentary breakfast. We weren't told of the specific reason as to why they wanted to move us (which was odd) although it was mentioned that some works were being undertaken at Paddington and if we wanted to return to Lancaster Gate we could. The Paddington was literally around the corner from the Lancaster Gate so we accepted and on arrival found the room to be bigger than those we had seen advertised at the Paddington and there were no signs of any works being carried out (we only saw signs of minor work after we had checked out and returned for our luggage later in the day).

The location of both the hotels are a few minutes walk to either Paddington or Lancaster Gate Tube stations with Hyde Park Italian Gardens being close by. The room was of a high standard, a huge, comfy bed, had recently been refurbished and came with a good selection of amenities. The breakfast was also good.

However the best asset that both of these hotels have is their staff. Every staff member we spoke to was extremely polite and pleasant and genuinely went out of their way to help. We never had any cause to complain (far from it) however we did observe a couple of individuals make quite unreasonable requests and the members of staff handled these individuals professionally and with courtesy and tried to accommodate them as best they could.

If we were to level any criticism it will be that the rooms are quite small, even taking into account the upgrade, however there was never any attempt to hide this fact and they are still very cosy regardless.

In a nutshell we enjoyed our brief time here so much that we will look at staying here each time we visit London in the future.",5,2015,08,10
103,Pleasant surprise,"I thought I booked to stay in a different hotel, but on arrival was told they had been trying to ring me to tell me there was a problem with my booking and I had to move to their sister hotel. As I had received no missed calls I was dubious as I was walked along the road to this hotel.

However there was no need for my anxiety - this hotel was perfectly lovely, with all the amenities I thought I had paid for. We were given complimentary breakfasts for our six day stay which was an added bonus. I do feel that they could avoid the unnecessary worry by informing you at the time of booking if you will be staying elsewhere, but this in no way spoilt a lovely stay.

Of particular note was the service at breakfast les by a lovely lady for whom nothing was too much trouble. 

I will definitely stay here again.  
",5,2015,08,09
103,Amazing hotel,"I stayed at this hotel on the 27th July 2015, arrived midday was welcomed into the hotel by such friendly staff, then taken to our room where I was more than satisfied although it was small. But what more to expect in Paddington! Once we arrived on room our phone rang confirming everything was okay with our room which was nice of reception. Hotel room was great, microwave fridge with complimentary biscuits tea coffee and water and even a buffer for my shoes! Extreamly friendly staff! Not much more we could have asked for! Will be visiting again in the near future thankyou so much for such a pleasent stay. 😊",5,2015,08,01
103,Not the worse hotel by far but tiny rooms,"I'd actually booked a room at another hotel in the group but was moved here owing to problems with the plumbing.  To be honest I'm not too sure how genuine this was; I've seen from the other reviews that this has happened to a few people and I wonder if this is just a means of filling up rooms in a less popular hotel as when I indicated at the reception I was less than impressed they offered to return me to the hotel I had originally booked for.  So why would this hotel be less popular?  Simply put it's due to the size of the rooms.  The room I was staying in had been recently redecorated which is a plus point although some of the features (eg the sink) are much bigger then necessary and take up a lot of valuable space.  The room is basically about half the size it needs to be.  If you want to watch TV, you sit on the bed.  If you want to use the desk, you sit on a stool.  The bed was a single and a bit on the short side.  Anyone over 5'10"" would find it very uncomfortable.  And the bed itself is right by the window on the ground floor beside the street so not somewhere for a light sleeper.  There are some good points: the room has AC for example and was kept clean.  However this hotel just didn't work for me as a business traveller.  It would be a good place to stay for a tourist who was planning to be out and about all day and who just wants somewhere clean and comfortable to sleep.",3,2015,07,31
103,Not good enough for 4 stars.,"Unfortunately, not optimal. 
The location is good - minutes to Paddington station and just as close to Lancester Square tube station.
The reception is very friendly. 
The rooms very, very small. In the four days we were in the room, we had 2 power outages, the warm water was safe only in the off hours, three times it was not available in the morning or evening, there was just nothing coming into the room. View from the window: Hinterhof.
Breakfast: Staff very unfriendly, own ""rules"" more important than the guest. There were three of us, had two rooms and had to discuss twice to get a table for 3 people. Our daughter, who was 3 minutes before us at breakfast, was even supposed to sit at a smaller table until our arrival, which was not necessary after a short discussion. The meaning is not revealed at all.
Breakfast was ok but not great. English Breakfast and Continental Breakfast, the latter consisting of a very small selection. The English Breakfast was tried to sell as an ""upgrade"" ... in England! 
If you are looking for a hotel that is still affordable by London standards, then the house is just fine, but you should not book it if you are looking for a positive hotel experience, but rather only if you want a place to sleep.",3,2024,10,05
103,Not suitable for claustrophobic 😂😂,"Staff very friendly and helpful, but the rest leaves something to be desired. Tiny room, in two you do not enter; breakfast with the bare minimum, was also required to pay for drinks in breakfasts consumed on days of overnight.",1,2024,08,05
103,Hotel a little old.. absolutely not 4 stars!,"It is in a great location for those who want to stay in the city but out of the chaos. Secluded in live but quiet neighborhood in the immediate vicinity with major attractions. The station, which can be reached on foot in 6 minutes, is well connected with the metro lines. The flaw is that it is a bit old-fashioned, the staff rarely smiles and seems not to be too welcoming, kind yes but uncozy and the room received which should have been a Deluxe was small, narrow and bloody noisy because the only view is on the terrace of the air conditioners. 
Good breakfast, not very rich but good English style. In short, my judgment yes, but....",3,2024,06,24
103,Appalling,"Very small rooms, carpet of questionable cleanliness, small double bed, sleeping with feet out, buffet breakfast that could be improved but very attentive staff, TV with no international channels. What bothered us the most is that the reception only speaks English. I think I understand more if they speak quickly, you ask them to speak slowly and they raise their voice as if you were deaf, you ask for someone who knows French, Spanish or Italian and there is no one, receptionists impassive as if it were not them, they do not try to assist you , impossible to understand each other. 
A 3 night stay to forget.
To finish, they do not deserve the stars they show, any 4 stars in Spain surpass them in all areas.",1,2024,06,18
103,Dust mites!,"Hotel in a great location but definitely not a 4* 
The rooms are small, but by London standards this is okay. 
As soon as we arrive we discover that the room is located in the building opposite the hotel.
After the first night I woke up covered in dust mite bites.
TERRIFYING! Probably due to the poor cleanliness, carpet and the impossibility of airing the room. NEVER AGAIN",1,2024,06,16
103,Good experience,"We liked it, it is a good hotel with a very good location, cleanliness 10/10 and very friendly and attentive staff. The rooms are a bit small for family trips, but if you are traveling as a couple or alone, they are excellent in size. The breakfast does not have as many options, but it is good. In general, the stay was very pleasant.",5,2024,05,27
103,Small dirty and without assistance,"1 star passed off as 4. Tiny rooms (you can't move in 2) dirty (dust, stained curtains, hair on the sheets, stained carpet, etc.). Some worn and dirty towels, no toilet brush. Window with broken handle and absolutely non-insulating, incredible cold air passed through. One day the room was not cleaned due to a ""national holiday"" (!?!). Cheap breakfast, you pass the food but the place is dirty (placemats, cutlery)... not to mention the fact that if you don't go early you have to queue for the table. Unsmiling, unhelpful staff, completely out of place, if you try to ask why something happens they don't know what to say and stare at you. No excuses and they deny everything. Only the location near the metro is fine, but I would NEVER go back. For charity.",1,2024,05,08
103,They don't answer emails,"We passed the December long weekend in London. When we paid for the stay, they charged us for breakfast for one day for 3 people. We could not solve the reversal of the improper charge and they told me to send them an email so that they could review it and their accounting would manage the refund of the amount. I have sent dozens of emails asking for a solution. I even called them by phone last February and they told me they would give me an answer but they have done nothing. Deplorable customer service.",2,2024,04,13
103,Good Hotel and good location.,"The hotel is located in a very good area, there are shops around, restaurants and even a neighborhood supermarket if you want to buy something. About five minutes away is the Paddington tube stop which connects with several lines. From there it is very easy to move to any area of London.
Now what is the hotel itself, well it is good. The rooms are small, but enough to feel comfortable. You have to be careful because the hallways are large and similar and it is easy to get confused at the beginning. If you go you will understand it haha. Everything was clean and the workers are very attentive, even if they don't speak any Spanish. The breakfast is simple but they have everything to make it a good breakfast. Especially some apple pies that were delicious. (Don't expect natural juice). The TV is quite large but without channels in Spanish, not one. The wifi works correctly and they have a menu that you access through QR in which they sell everything and not very expensive. I hope this opinion is useful to you. If I come back I will try to book here again unless the price goes up too much because it depends on the date and there is quite a variation in price. Greetings.",4,2024,02,24
103,Stupendous,"I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and everything was perfect. Good location a stone's throw from the tube and Hyde Park, excellent cleaning which took place daily with towels changed, renovated room small but not too much for London standards equipped with every kind of comfort (fridge, iron and ironing table, safe, bottled water welcome, cups, kettle, microwave, coffee and sugar, shampoo, shower gel, hair cream and hand soap). The only flaw is the queen size bed which is decidedly small for two adults. If I return to London I will definitely go there again.",5,2024,02,18
103,Ridiculously small room for a 4 star,"The photos do not correspond to reality. The room was tiny, with the bed built into the wall, you could hardly even walk. The views were depressing of a very abandoned interior patio. The beds had spring mattresses and you couldn't even cover yourself with the duvet. I complained that the photos did not look like reality, that they could change my room and they told me that the photos are indicative. The hotel was a maze of hallways to get to the room. I don't understand how it can be a 4 star. The only positive thing to say is that it was quiet to sleep in.",2,2024,02,16

103,First time in London: I hope to return soon!,"I gave 5 stars because I found the hotel exactly as it was shown in the photos: modern, comfortable and in a strategic position for visiting London.
I am satisfied with all the hotel services. The room was cleaned every morning, complete with a change of towels.
The breakfast was very good and plentiful, but not everything is included in the ""breakfast included"" package... for example, the cappuccino had to be paid separately.
The room was equipped with all the essentials, such as a hairdryer, shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, and even more: in the wardrobe there was also an iron and ironing board, and there was also a microwave and everything needed to make yourself tea or a coffee in the room.
The staff was also very attentive and helpful, especially the receptionist Andreea Rian who, with her kindness and fluent Italian, made us feel at home!",5,2023,11,11

We were in the half of the building without a lift and had to carry our suitcases up four flights of stairs.

I wrote two emails in the previous days saying that my friend would come by to collect it and I didn't receive any response. When I arrived at the hotel desk, the person at the reception confirmed that he had seen and read the emails and I didn't receive any. answer, the

Buena temperatura y funcionamiento de la calefacción. Baño con todas amenities, toallas y secador de pelo. 

No teníamos desayuno, y finalmente lo contratamos con el hotel. Merece mucho la pena, (sobretodo económicamente si lo comparas con desayunos fuera del hotel) el zumo de naranja Riquísimo, la fruta, el pourridge, croissants, en general buen desayuno (no tanto el cafe) destacar a Riva que a través de su portugués siempre intentaba hablarnos un poquito en español. 

El check out, súper rápido con una chica pelirroja que no recuerdo su nombre. A última hora conocimos a Anahí, que pena que fuera cuando ya nos íbamos. Igualmente fue muy simpática.

Nos guardaron las maletas sin problema. 

Localización estupenda, 5 min andando de Paddington (una maravilla) 

A mejorar: la limpieza de la habitación. Sobre todo del baño. Se limitan únicamente a cambiar las toallas. Ni barrer ni aspirar. Los mismos pelos que había por la mañana seguían a la noche. Tampoco retiraron un plato de comida.

Hablé con booking que es donde reserve les dijeron que me hicieran un cambio de habitación pero se negaron ya que decían que yo tenia una reserva de habitación individual y que esa era la que me había tocado y si quería la de la foto de mi reserva tenía que pagar más.

103,"Hotel ""Souterrain""","Erster Eindruck von Außen sehr gut, auch der Empfangsbereich. Habe dann allerdings ein Zimmer im Haus auf der anderen Straßenseite im Souterrain/Keller bekommen mit ""Ausblick"" in einen schäbigen Innenhof, aber immerhin hat man für Londoner Verhältnisse einen außerordentlichen Wasserdruck. Frühstücksraum im Haupthaus auch in Souterrain/Keller, Büffet war ok, aber auch nicht mehr.
Warte jetzt seit 2 Monaten, daß man mir die Rechnung zusendet, habe mindestens schon 20 mal deswegen telephoniert.",2,2022,09,01
103,Muy bueno.,"Tuve la oportunidad de hospedarme en una habitación simple durante 4 noches . La experiencia fue muy buena.
Habitación pequeña pero limpia y con todo lo necesario , sobre todo si vas a Londres por turismo. El desayuno continental me incluyó en la tarifa y fue bueno , más de lo que ofrece un desayuno continental convencional , uno queda satisfecho. El hotel tiene ascensor, los pasadizos son un poco enrevesados para llegar a la habitación , pero es lo de menos.
El personal de Recepción fue atento , pero en particular Kazi , muy servicial , paciente , sus consejos muy acertados, y siempre con una sonrisa. 
La ubicación , era muy buena , hay mucho comercio , restaurantes y la Estación PADDINGTON a solo unas cuadras .
Definitivamente si regresaría.",5,2022,08,30
103,Buena Ubicación,"Estuve hospedada 8 días en abril 2022, muy cerca de Paddington Station, caminando 2 cuadras llegas a Hyde Park, a Kensington Palace y a todos lados puedes ir caminando, el desayuno bien bueno. el personal de atención de las habitaciones mala, gente muy joven sin experiencia, una día limpiaron mi habitación y dejaron la puerta abierta de par en par todo el día, no faltaba nada al llegar, otro día llegue como a las 19;00 y no habían limpiado la habitación, nunca dejaban shampoo siempre había que pedirlo. Al hacer la reserva decía que todos los día tendría fruta fresca y agua en la habitación, la fruta nunca la vi. El Manager muy atento y preocupado de la estadía de los pasajeros, creo que es lo mejor que tiene el hotel, insisto el personal es muy joven e inexperto. La habitación muy pequeña, pero cuenta con microondas, refrigerador pequeño y hervidor por lo que es fácil tomarse un te o café en las noches frías de Londres, el te y el café te lo dan.
Lo peor es que llegas al lobby y al ir a los ascensores hay una escalera, muy dificil con maletas, y lo mismo en el piso, llegas y al ir a la habitación bajabas una escalera, no es apto para discapacitados",4,2022,06,02
103,Schlechtes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis,"Zimmer (Compact DZ)nicht sauber, volle Mülleimer. Bar schön aber geschlossen, Getränke sollte man sich am Kiosk gegenüber kaufen.

103,Pessima esperienza SCANDALOSO,"Prenoto l'albero con booking era presente anche un'offerta e scelgo la Camera Deluxe(quella più costosa), una volta entrati rimaniamo scioccati.Ci viene data la camere 317 che non corrisponde a tutte le caratteristiche scritte in quanto la camere si presenta molto più piccola il bagno era minuscolo a tutto questo si potrebbe anche sorvolare ma il problema maggiore era la scarsa igiene.Camera rumorosa(era sotto i frigo/motori climatizzatori) ma soprattutto era sporca con polvere ovunque(non vi racconto cosa c'era  sotto il letto) e in pendenza. Tutti  i mobili erano mezzi rotti(vedi il vetro sopra al comodino che era scollato) il comodino aveva un pezzo di legno sotto al piede per restare in equilibrio, le finestre erano tutte scrostare con tende sporche e rotte. Un giorno ci hanno lasciato anche senza carta igienica e quando l'abbiamo richiesta in reception nessuno l""ha portata siamo andati noi a cercarla nello stanzino.
Gli alberghi 4 stelle sono differenti questo si può considerare solo uno scarsissimo 3 stelle per essere gentili.",1,2022,04,30
103,Hotel super pulito e super gentili,"L’hotel è molto bello esteticamente, in una zona tranquilla vicinissimo ad Hyde Park, permettendoci di raggiungere varie attrazioni anche a piedi! 
Abbiamo dormito benissimo, nonostante in Inghilterra siano famosi per sentire tutto a causa delle pareti poco isolate: invece qui con nostra sorpresa non abbiamo sentito alcun rumore! Abbiamo dormito bene, al caldo e ogni volta la camera era sempre molto pulita e preparata, rifornita ogni giorno di ogni accessorio. 
Il personale alla reception è sempre stato gentilissimo e disponibile: Michelle è sempre stata disponibile a rispondere adeguatamente ad ogni nostra domanda e ci ha sempre aiutate per ogni evenienza! 
Molto molto bello davvero!",5,2022,04,04
103,Pessimo servizio e pulizia,"la camere dell'hotel non è male per lo standard della città ciò che è assolutamente pessimo è il servizio ed il personale. 
la camere era sporca, molta polvere e il bagno non era stato pulito bene. il personale non è in grado di gestire nessun tipo di richiesta e composto da persone che parlano molto male l'inglese. 
la cosa peggiore è stato però il fatto che tra la prima e la seconda notte nessuno ha rifatto la stanza, siamo usciti di casa la mattina e al ritorno la sera tardi la camera era ancora come la mattina. siamo andati a lamentarci in reception ma il night manager non ha fatto nulla per risolvere il problema. 
sconsigliato assolutamente",1,2021,11,22

L'albergo è situato a pochi minuti a piedi dalla fermata metro Paddington.
Il personale molto cortese e più di uno parla italiano. Le camere non sono molto ampie ma ben curate e pulite.
Le nostre disponevano di frigobar, bollitore e microonde, oltre ad un tvled da 40 a parete. 
Letti comodi (forse un po' corti).
La colazione (tradizionale inglese) è stata forse il punto più debole, più che altro per la poca varietà di cibi e bevande. Comunque per pochi giorni, va bene ugualmente.",5,2020,01,06

103,Hotel céntrico con fantástica relación calidad precio.,"Pequeño hotel al lado de Hyde Park y cerca del metro. La habitación es pequeña cosa normal en Londres pero tiene de todo. El baño era minúsculo con calefacción en el suelo, con todos los espacios bien aprovechados. Cama cómoda y buena calefacción. Eso si, solo hablan inglés, incluso la tele todos los canales son en inglés. El desayuno es muy bueno y puedes pedir que te hagan más cosas al momento como beicon, huevos o tostadas.",4,2019,12,26
103,Una buena elección,"Durante nuestra última visita a Londres nos hemos alojado cinco días en el Park Grand Paddington Court.
La ubicación es cómoda, en el agradable barrio de Paddington. Muy tranquilo y bien comunicado, con un importante nudo de transportes (metro, buses y tren) a pocos metros.
El hotel no ofrece grandes lujos pero sí todo lo necesario para una confortable estancia.
Quizá las habitaciones (en particular, el cuarto de baño) un poco justas y el desayuno podría ser más variado pero cualquier pequeña falta que se pueda poner queda compensada con la excelente disposición del personal del hotel. Mención especial a Pilar y a Sergio, siempre dispuestos, con simpatía y eficacia, a resolver cualquier incidencia y aportar sugerencias de interés.
En resumen, el hotel es una buena opción a un precio razonable.
La amabilidad es un extra que el dinero no puede pagar. 
Muchas gracias.

Ebenfalls beim Hydepark eine Station des Big Bus Sightseeing Busses. Ausgiebiges und sehr gutes Frühstücksbuffet.,4,2019,11,22
103,Staff molto carino,"Sebbene le stanze non siano molto grandi, si sta bene in questo albergo a due passi dalla stazione Paddington e dai Giardini di Kensington. Lo staff, ed in particolare Paola ed un ragazzo di cui ora non ricordo il nome (con una bella stazza e con la barba!) che parlano italiano, sono stati deliziosi, aiutandoci anche quando ci siamo sentiti persi. Siamo infatti finiti in questo albergo mandati da un altro albergo che fa parte dello stesso gruppo e che al nostro arrivo ci ha detto che c'erano problemi di acqua calda da loro. Per noi è quindi stato un ripiego ma tutto sommato non ci lamentiamo perché lo staff ha compensato con il suo impegno. Paola ci ha dato diversi consigli su dove andare e cosa fare. Ci ha anche prenotato una macchina per andare agli Harry Potter Warner Studios. Davvero carini.",5,2019,11,11
103,Consigliato soprattutto per la posizione,"Prenotato direttamente sul loro sito per le tariffe più convenienti con colazione compresa. Abbiamo preso una camera Deluxe (3° piano vista strada) e la scelta è stata saggia: lo spazio non era tanto in camera (non oso pensare le compact nei seminterrati...), in particolare il bagno era molto piccolo. Per il resto tutto come da aspettative, colazione Full English buona (non mi sono piaciute le marmellate molto ""gommose"", meno male che c'era la Nutella originale), ma poche scelte dolci. Personale gentile e disponibile.Posizione perfetta per la stazione di Paddington ed a due passi da Hyde Park e Lancaster Gate. Note dolenti: canali Tv solo inglesi, all'arrivo c'era solo un asciugamano pulito in bagno (!), manutenzione un pò da rivedere soprattutto in bagno (non funzionava la ventola di aspirazione e il vetro nella vasca non era proprio a tenuta stagna...), infine tolgo una stella perché una mattina inserendo il cartello ""non disturbare"" ci siamo trovati sotto la porta (alle 10 di mattina!) un foglio che comunicava che la pulizia l'avrebbero fatta il giorno dopo.....A seguito delle mie rimostranze, in reception, hanno risolto. Non sempre venivano ripristinati i bicchieri/tazze pulite e le bustine di tè. In definitiva il servizio in camera non è stato impeccabile. Peccato.",3,2019,09,16

In der Nähe sind gute Restaurants und auch EInkaufsmöglichkeiten. Die Zimmer sind für englische Verhältnisse geräumig, sehr komfortabel eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Durch die Lage in einer Seitenstraße ist es generell sehr ruhig. Das Personal ist außerordentlich freundlich und hilfsbereit. Im Zimmerpreis inbegriffen war englisches Frühstück.

103,NON CONSIGLIATO,"Normalmente sono una che tutto sommato trova il lato positivo ovunque e prima di criticare aspetto il tempo giusto per dare a tutti il beneficio del dubbio. Non mi soffermo neanche a recensire l’ hotel ( camere piccole, bagno minuscolo, insonorizzazione zero, ma tutto sommato soggiorno piacevole), voglio solo parlare della professionalità pari a ZERO di questo hotel. 
Ho soggiornato li dal 12 maggio al 16, la notte prima della partenza (11 maggio) mi hanno preautorizzato il costo della prima notte( prenotato con booking) per 117€. Quando sono arrivata la il 12 ho pagato il costo totale per tutte le notti (compresa quella già trattenuta la notte prima, quindi come se avessi pagato una notte in piu visto che di fatto i soldi sono ancora bloccati) e ad oggi 25 maggio ancora non mi hanno restituito i soldi della prima notte. Quando sono arrivata li mi hanno risposto che la somma sarebbe stata sbloccata dopo 3 giorni al massimo... ne sono passati 14!! Ovviamente ho scritto la bellezza di 7 mail durante queste due settimane a cui non ho MAI ricevuto risposta. Problemi con le mail? Neanche per sogno, visto che fino al 10maggio ci siamo scambiati piu volte informazioni via mail riguardanti il soggiorno futuro alle quali mi hanno risposto sempre in meno di mezzora dall’invio delle richieste.

il problema e' che anche se so' che londra ha camere piccole non pensavo una camera dove il 3 letto una poltrona aperta non permetteva di passare verso il letto 
il bagno mai visto una cosa simile piccolo ma piccolo che non avete idea io che sono magrissimo toccavo con le spalle tra muro e doccia per lavarmi la faccia nel lavandino .
veramente troppo piccola meno male che uscivamo alle 8 e rientravamo alle 22.

pro :
posizione stupenda vicino a metro e vicino a quartieri con ristoranti ottimi ....zona molto molto tranquilla e pulita
la colazione compresa nel prezzo con poco dolce ma cmq buona considerando che a londra sono care.

quindi ok....ma okkio alle camere.

103,Vacanza bellissima ,"Ho trascorso 4 giorni a Londra in questo hotel molto carino con la famiglia ed amici, le 5 stelle le ho date solo perché c’era alla reception Chiara che è stata gentilissima e disponibilissima, altrimenti avrei dato 4 stelle ..",5,2019,04,27
103,Che delusione!,"Abbiamo prenotato con 4 mesi di anticipo su Booking una tripla e una singola. Arrivati alle 12 solo la singola era pronta (ok giustificati il check-in ci dicono inizi alle 14). Abbiamo fatto la registrazione lo stesso, ma dopo esserci assicurati che non ci sarebbero stati problemi, abbiamo lasciato i bagagli nella singola e siamo andati in giro per Londra e tornati dopo cena. La singola era molto piccola e mancante di alcune delle cose previste, ad esempio frigorifero. Ma mai ci saremmo immaginati di finire, nella  depandance di fronte all'albergo, in una tripla sottoterra, grande quanto il letto matrimoniale (il terzo letto era una piccola brandina  posizionata nell'unico spazio libero della stanza che avrebbe dovuto permettere gli spostamenti all'interno della camera) con un armadio più piccolo di quello della singola. Le nostre lamentele non sono servite a nulla. Avremmo dovuto precisare che non volevamo la camera sottoterra, ci hanno risposto (non si capisce dove e quando). Non erano disponibili altre camere per quella notte ma avremmo potuto cambiare solo il giorno successivo.
Alle 10 di sera, per fortuna, il vicino albergo non aveva più triple ma aveva due doppie che ci ha dato allo stesso prezzo della tripla del Park Grand Paddington Court London. La tripla era molto più piccola di ognuna di queste camere.
Ultima nota: non fidatevi delle foto dell'albergo, la realtà è ben diversa. La reception è un buco, non ci sono spazi comuni, non c'è la hall e ci sono 6, 7 gradini per arrivare all'ascensore.
Nel nostro caso, possiamo dirlo: ""Tutto è bene quello che finisce bene!"" ma è meglio non rischiare.
Purtroppo non ho fatto in tempo a fare foto",1,2019,04,24

Letto piccolissimo Attaccato alla parete, E un arredamento moooolto  vecchio. Le cose positive dell’albergo sono lo staff, la reception (tutti ragazzi giovani e molto gentili e disponibili), la pulizia delle camere, E il quartiere dove situato l’hotel (una zona molto tranquilla ed elegante).

103,Mucho mejor de lo que esperábamos,"En un primer momento temíamos por la calidad del hotel después de haber estado investigando otros por esta zona y por King Cross. Finalmente nos decidimos por Park Grand Paddington Court por su situación y por la calidad que dejaban ver tanto las fotografías de los viajeros como las del propio hotel.

Al llegar nos recibieron genial (creo recordar que el chico de recepción se llamaba Daniel), nos indicaron cual era nuestra habitación y nos llevaron las maletas. Al llegar nos dimos cuenta de que estábamos el el piso ""- 1"" y que, a pesar de que la habitación contaba con una ventana, nos gustaría poder estar en un piso superior para tener mayor sensación de libertad. Al comentar estos detalles con recepción nos indicaron que sin problema a la mañana siguiente nos cambiarían de habitación y así fue.

Las habitaciones son todas espaciosas y cómodas. Es muy útil tener acceso a café, té y microondas en todo momento porque facilita desperezarse por las mañanas. Los baños son limpios, con ducha y amplios; y tienen todo tipo de amenities.

Sin duda volveriamos a este hotel y lo recomendamos 100%.",5,2019,02,27

103,Buon Albergo,"La struttura è in una buona posizione, a meno di 10 minuti a piedi dalla stazione dei treni e della metropolitana di Paddington, in un quartiere elegante dove sono presenti diversi ristoranti.
Al nostro arrivo la sera tardi scopriamo che al posto della stanza di grandezza media, per errore ci hanno assegnato una stanza piccolissima, con un letto da meno di una piazza e mezzo appoggiato contro il muro. Purtroppo non c'era modo di rimediare all'errore e abbiamo dovuto passare una notte molto scomoda. il giorno dopo ci hanno cambiato camera assegnandoci quella che avevamo pagato e per scusarsi ci hanno offerto la colazione per l'intero soggiorno. Al momento di lasciare l'albergo ci hanno presentato il conto delle colazioni. Dopo aver spiegato l'accaduto si sono scusati. Nulla da dire, rimediano ai loro errori in fretta, però sarebbe gradita un'attenzione maggiore verso il cliente.
La camera media è confortevole, pulita ,tenuta bene. La colazione internazionale non offre moltissimo, ma ci sono comunque le cose tipiche di una colazione inglese.
Il personale è sempre stato cortese. Prezzo un po' alto rispetto al servizio offerto, però siamo a Londra in una zona semicentrale quindi è più che comprensibile.",3,2019,02,04

Der Ubahnhof Paddington sowie der Hydepark und die Edware Road sind super zu Fuß zu erreichen.
Das Hotel macht bereits auf dem ersten Blick einen schönen Eindruck. Das Personal ist sofort auf unsere Wünsche eingegangen und hat uns neben dem von uns gebuchten Zimmer sogar noch 2 weitere gezeigt, da wir gerne eine Badewanne wollten. Die Umbuchung wurde durchgeführt und wir wurden auf unsere Zimmer gebracht.
Die Zimmer sind sauber und neu.
Die Größe der Zimmer ist für Londoner Verhältnisse komplett ausreichend.
Der Preis ist unserer Meinung nach unschlagbar und wir haben nicht vor uns für unseren nächsten London Trip ein anderes Hotel zu suchen, sondern werden definitiv wieder hier Einchecken!

Die Zimmer sind, wie fast alle in London, eher klein ausgemessen. Auch das Bett ist nicht sonderlich gross. Jedoch reicht dies für ein Wochenende vollends aus. Die Zimmer sind sehr säuber & ordentlich eingerichtet. 

Ich würde dieses Hotel bei einer erneuten Reise in die englische Hauptstadt sofort wieder wählen, denn es hat mir gefallen!",4,2018,12,08
103,Camera disastrosa,"L’ubicazione dell’albergo è interessante, vicino alla Stazione ferroviaria di Paddington e alla Metro.
Il personale alla reception si è sforzato di parlarmi in Italiano, cosa che fa sempre piacere quando uno viaggia tanto.
Le note dolenti sono per: 
la camera che era piccolissima, ubicata al piano -1 e cioè sotto il livello stradale, umida, fredda e cumoli di biancheria sporca o aspirapolveri soggiornavano sempre fuori dalla porta della mia camera;
la colazione era scarsa, di bassa qualità e gestita forse da personale inesperto o con me sfortunato visto che un giorno non sono riusciti a portarmi un caffè espresso e l’altro giorno hanno depositato tazze sporche sul tavolo che stavo utilizzando per la colazione. 
Considerato un costo di 375 € x 2 notti B.B. il rapporto qualità prezzo è pessimo anche per Londra.",2,2018,12,03
103,buono dopo il cambio della stanza,"prima notte in stanza non in hotel ma palazzo di fronte, non da prenotazione fatto, il mattino successivo con nostre lamentela cambio stanza .... buona, bagno piccolo come solito, colazioni buone ma in locale piccola la zona di buffet
personale gentile e accogliente",3,2018,11,30
103,Black Friday,"Ero già stata in questa struttura qualche anno fa e l’ho trovata migliorata.
La colazione è buona e abbondante, buona la pulizia e il livello di manutenzione, buona la dotazione delle camere (set cortesia completo e phon vero), la posizione è tranquilla ma ottima per raggiungere la metro e il centro.
Mi è piaciuta soprattutto la disponibilità da parte del personale a soddisfare le nostre esigenze con cortesia e professionalità (un grazie particolare a Georg che è stato pazientissimo con noi).
Unico neo la camera standard che per due persone è davvero poco spaziosa, in particolare il letto è troppo piccolo e difficilmente accessibile visto che uno dei due lati è contro il muro. Abbiamo segnalato il nostro disagio al personale che, prontamente, ci ha sostituito la camera con una Club che è davvero molto confortevole.
Torneremo sicuramente.",4,2018,11,26
103,Mario Ponticelli.. Pisa Italy,Best compliments  for  your  staff excellent!! Thank you. Ottima struttura alberghiera per soggiornare a Londra. Ambienti curati nei minimi particolari. Ottimo breakfast. Prezzi ottimi e personale molto professionale.,5,2018,11,23
103,Correcto,"El hotel tiene un aspecto muy agradable. Pero realmente es como en las películas. Para acceder a la habitación subíamos 2 pisos en ascensor, para luego bajar 2 pisos por unas escaleras muy estrechas en las que resultaba un poco engorroso bajar con una maleta grande. Según nos dijeron no había otra manera de acceder a la habitación.",3,2018,11,12
103,Camere lillipuziane,Concordo con altri viaggiatori nel dire che nelle camere standard non si riesce neanche ad aprire una valigia. In realtà in bagno non c'è neanche il posto per appoggiare una borsetta contenente il necessaire. Di cortesia non ne parliamo neanche. Albergo scelto a caso perché vicino a paddington Station ma la prossima volta farò più attenzione. Esternamente non male.,2,2018,10,30
103,Estadia normal,"Bien ubicado. A pocas cuadras de la estación Paddington que conecta con el aeropuerto. Cerca de Hyde Park.
El personal del desk muy amable.Algunos hablan en español.
Habitación equipada con microndas y refrigerador, pero muy pequeña",3,2018,10,12
103,"Gute Lage, sauberes Hotel, überragender Service","Unser verlängertes Wochenende in London hat ziemlich verkorkst begonnen: Flug verspätet, ein Verantwortlicher des ursprünglich gebuchten Hotels (wir wollten es aufgrund von Hinweisen Ortskundiger stornieren) war nicht aufzutreiben. Und als wir in unser neues Hotel einchecken wollten, waren keine Dreibettzimmer (entgegen Auskunft eines Internetportals) mehr frei. Wir waren also alles andere als in Wochenendlaune. Die Dame am Empfang, die das mitbekommen hatte, war außerordentlich geduldig und sehr bemüht, eine (auch preislich einigermaßen passende) Alternative mit dem zentralen Buchungsservice, mit dem sie telefonieren musste, um uns unterbringen zu können, auszuhandeln. Und von da an ging es bergauf. Wir mussten kurz auf unser Zimmer warten, wurde aber mit heißer Schokolade versorgt und wurden dann von einem sehr freundlichen Mitarbeiter zum Zimmer geführt. Dies war - wie in London üblich - nicht unbedingt groß, aber super-gemütlich eingerichtet und sauber. Und das (ebenfalls etwas kleine Badezimmer) war Quasi wie neu. Wir legen sehr viel Wert auf Sauberkeit im Bad und waren deshalb sehr erfreut. Da wir das Zimmer mit anderen Londoner Hotelzimmern vergleichen und dabei auch den Preis mit ins Kalkül ziehen, bekommt auch das Zimmer volle Punktzahl.

Das Frühstück kann sich für britische Verhältnisse mehr als sehen lassen! Neben dem landestypischen Angebot (Würste, Rührei, gegrillte Tomaten und Pilze etc.) gab es auch Müsli, Joghurt, Cornflakes, Wurst, Käse, sowie an eine Auswahl an Broten, Marmeladen (inkl. Honig und Nutella) und frischem Obst. Zu trinken gab es Säfte, Milch, Tee, Kaffee, Kakao, Wasser. Und wenn man möchte kann man sich ein Omelett machen lassen; was braucht man mehr :-)

Das Personal am Empfang war überaus freundlich und versorgte uns gerne mit Essens- und Freizeittipps.

Über den Fitnessraum kann ich nichts sagen, da ich ihn nicht benutzt habe.

Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut. in wenigen Gehminuten ist man am Hydepark oder auch an der U-Bahn-Haltestelle Paddington, von wo aus man sehr schnell in die Stadtmitte kommt.

Man bekommt in diesem Hotel sehr viel für sein Geld und es ist damit von meiner Seite eine uneingeschränkte Empfehlung. Wir werden auf jeden Fall das nächste Mal wieder hier absteigen und gar nicht erst nach anderen Hotels schauen. Besser kann es nach meiner Ansicht in dieser Preisklasse auf keinen Fall werden.

Und zum Schluss ist es mir ein besonderes Anliegen, mich noch einmal bei ""unserer"" supernetten Dame am Empfang (Cosmina Lupu) zu bedanken, die sich mit soviel persönlichem Engagement um unser Wohlergehen bemüht und damit dazu beigetragen hat, dass dieser Londonaufenthalt der schönste war, den wir je hatten: Thank you so much for youre smile, for your kindness and your warm attention on our wellbeing.",5,2018,10,03
103,Very nice!,"Estancia muy confortable y personal muy agradable, instalaciones modernas con todo tipo de facilidades.cama confortable y muy buena limpieza. Desayuno delicioso.Cerca de metro para moverse por la ciudad.Lo recomiendo.",5,2018,09,20
103,Si tienes suerte está bien,"Llegamos aquí porque nos reubicaron ya que nuestro hotel tenía problemas.
Teníamos reservado una habitación triple y una doble. La triple estaba muy bien, tenía fruta al llegar y microondas . La doble era bastante pequeña y no tenía nada de lo que tenía la triple. No entiendo bien la diferencia entre ambas. Además la doble estaba en un pasillo que tenían abandonado y todos los días había basura en él, ese pasillo no tenía ninguna ventilación por lo que los olores eran bastante malos ",3,2018,08,15
103,Gentilezza e cortesia,"È la mia terza volta in questo hotel, che ormai scelgo sistematicamente quando mi capita di venire a Londra, quindi il mio giudizio è quasi scontato. 

Oltre ad essere un posto molto accogliente, pulito (cosa non scontata a Londra) e in un ottimo quartiere, direi che la vera differenza la fa il personale estremamente gentile e premuroso (altra cosa difficile da trovare a Londra), specialmente le ragazze al banco del check-in, impeccabili, efficienti e sempre sorridenti. 

Per quanto mi riguarda, promosso a pieni voti. Ci tornerò. 

",5,2018,08,10
103,Un hotel más,"En nuestro pasillo había bolsas de basura todas las noches y eso provocaba mal olor que al no tener los pasillos ventilación lo empeoraba. Por lo demás todo normal. Las habitaciones triples están bien y las dobles son un poco pequeñas. La cama bastante cómoda y el personal de recepción muy agradable y atento. El desayuno es escaso y poco variado, por lo que no merece lo que cuesta.",3,2018,08,09
103,Erholsames cityhotel,"Im mai war ich mit meiner Familie in diesem Hotel es ist sauber, stilvoll eingerichtete d das Personal ist sehr aufmerksam. Leider gibt es keinen hoteleigenen Parkplatz, aber ein Parkhaus in der Nähe. Am Wochenende kann man am Straßenrand parken. Die Gegend ist sehr gesittet. Besonders gut fanden wir die nähezum kensingtongardens/ Hyde Park. So konnten wir am Ende des Tages immer gut runterkommen. Dies gefiel vor allem unserem Jüngsten. Die Atmosphäre ist heiter. Das Hotel liegt außerhalb der Maut Zone und ist auch so zu erreichen. Das spart Gebühren ",5,2018,08,06
103,Excelente,"Es la primera vez que viajo a Londres El hotel es excelente. La habitacion muy confortable. El baño nuevo, impecable. En la recepcion debo felicitar a Monica que estuvo siempre atenta a solucionarme todos los problemas con el idioma. Muy recomendable",5,2018,08,06
103,Estancia de 10,"Pese a que la habitación era pequeña (tipico en hoteles de Londres) era super acogedora. No le faltaba nada y el personal muy amable durante toda la estancia. Super contentos con este hotel, repetiremos seguro!",5,2018,07,30
103,Buen hotel ,"El hotel está ubicado en el pintoresco barrio de Paddington, cerca de Notting Hill. Es un lindo hotel. La habitación un tanto pequeña pero muy bien equipada y con todo el confort necesario. Un desayuno aceptable y un trato muy cordial del personal. Está a dos cuadras de la estación de metro y de tren. Recomendable. ",3,2018,07,14
103,4 stelle? ma nemmeno 2....,"esterno hotel decoroso, il peggio sta dentro.
arrivati si nota subito una certa scortesia alla reception.
stanza quasi sottoterra, di dimensioni lillipuziane, letto singolo sotto la finestra piena di spifferi, ovviamente bagno ""minimal"" quanto a dimensioni. 
tutto piccolo e angusto, anche i corridoi per arrivare alla camera, maleodoranti e claustrofobici.
colazione ridicola, non degna di questo nome e soprattutto di un 4 stelle.
non ci tornerei.",1,2018,06,25
103,Carino ma niente di più,"Partiamo dal presupposto che essendo già stati a Londra non ci aspettavamo un trilocale di 200 mq, tuttavia abbiamo prenotato la camera deluxe per avere un minimo di comodità in più ma veramente non si possono aprire nemmeno le valigie. A questo punto, se volete alloggiare in questo hotel e non potete permettervi una suite, vi consiglio di prenotare le camere che costano meno, non noterete nessuna differenza. Riguardo al tanto citato personale devo dire che a noi non è stato riservato nemmeno un sorriso di circostanza. Al momento di partire abbiamo ritirato i bagagli che avevamo lasciato in deposito e abbiamo chiesto se potevamo aprirli per sistemare gli ultimi acquisti. Siamo stati portati in una sorta di office room dove una sgarbata signora ci ha quasi cacciati via perché in attesa di una conference call. Nessuno è intervenuto! Per il resto l’hotel è comodo e ben ubicato, consiglierei sicuramente maggiore attenzione alla pulizia, abbastanza carente. Non acquistate la colazione: esistono posticini a poche decine di metri dove con 4-5£ mangi all’inverosimile ed è tutto buonissimo. Letto molto comodo!",3,2018,06,24
103,Eine Katastrophe!,"Ich bin beruflich sehr viel unterwegs, in den verschiedensten Hotels und Pensionen. Gute, schlechtere, preiswerte, teure. Dieses Hotel ist aber unter der Kategorie ""schlecht & teuer"" zu verbuchen! Angefangen hat es damit, dass mir niemand helfen konnte, mein Zimmer zu finden (""sorry, we are all busy..""?!) (Hintergrund: das Hotel ist sehr verwinkelt gebaut, mein Zimmer war in einem Nebentrakt). Die Teppiche sind alle sehr stark abgenutzt, aber OK. Dann der Kracher: ein Wohnklo! Das Zimmer hatte gefühlte 5qm! Um den Vorhang am Fenster zuzuziehen, musste man auf das Bett klettern!!! Dann wollte ich mein Handy aufladen, wobei mir direkt die komplette Steckdose entgegenkam. Es tut mir leid, aber dieses Hotel ist mit Abstand(!) das schlechteste, was mir in den letzten 10 Jahren je untergekommen ist. Nie wieder!",1,2018,06,22
103,La cortesia qui é sconosciuta,Hotel carino esternamente. All'interno potrebbe non essere male ma il personale è pessimo. Ho prenotato una camera doppia uso singola e quando chiedo inetto queen o king size mi chiedono 20 sterline di sovrapprezzo. Quando mi altero si scusano e mi danno una minuscola king size nel piano seminterrato. Tristissima. Non  vedi la luce. Sei praticamente un topo in trappola. Colazione scarsa come in un hotel da 200 sterline a notte non ne avevo mai viste. Mai più. E peccato perché da fuori sembrava molto carino.,2,2018,05,17
103,CUANDO EL HOTEL FORMA PARTE DE TUS VACACIONES!!!!,"Llegamos a Londres muy cansados después de 15 horas de vuelo y no de muy buen humor. Al hacer el check in cosa que por lo general es lento en casi todos los hoteles, nos encontramos con la sonrisa de Fatma y el humor comenzo a cambiar y de ahí en adelante todo fue perfecto. La atención de los chicos de la puerta para llevarnos la maleta, el aseo en la habitación, la calefacción en el piso del baño, la calidad del desayuno y las chicas que te sirven el mismo siempre dispuestas a atenderte.
En lo que respecta a la ubicación es perfecta. A 5 minutos de dos estaciones de metro de lineas diferentes y a la estación de tren de Paddington que conecta con el aeropuerto en 15 minutos si tomas el express o 35 si tomas el tren normal.
Lo único que podría decir para tener en cuenta es el tamaño de las habitaciones. En la deluxe no entrabamos con las dos valijas ni tampoco en la cama ya que era corta para nuestra altura. La habitación club es ideal.
Un plus es el handy que te dan para no gastar bateria de tu celu y poder usar el google map con él.
Sin dudas será siempre nuestro hogar en Londres y esperamos volver pronto.
Gracias Fatma por todo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,2018,05,14
103,Es war OK…aber wirklich nicht mehr als das!,"haben uns von den guten Bewertungen über die Lage des Hotels irreführen lassen. Die Lage ist gut, wenn die massgebenden Kriterien die Nähe zu 2 U-Bahn-Stationen und zum Hyde-Park sind. Ansonsten ist in der Umgebung absolut nichts los, nur Restaurants/Pubs und Shops, welche – fast – rund um die Uhr geöffnet sind. 
Das Zimmer war nicht klein, sondern winzig, und dies für 2 Erwachsene und ein Teenager. Das Doppelbett mass höchsten 1,20 m!! ok, ok, vielleicht waren es 1,40…mikroskopisch kleines Bad mit absolut NULL Ablagefläche!! Die Duschkabine hingegen war sauber, dicht und im Vergleich zu allem anderen relativ grosszügig. Aber das Beste kommt noch: das Zimmer befand sich im UNTERGESCHOSS!! wir kamen uns wie im Dungeon vor.
im UG befindet sich auch das Restaurant, in welchem wir 1mal gefrühstückt haben. Es ist laut und chaotisch, die Auswahl an Speisen ist jedoch i.O.
Personal freundlich und hilfsbereit.",3,2018,05,04
103,Lástima de la cama blanda,"Buena ubicación. Barrio céntrico,tranquilo,lleno de restaurantes y tiendas. Tenéis buses que os llevan al centro y parada de metro a pocos minutos. La habitación es pequeña pero moderna y limpia. El baño también es mini pero tiene calefacción en el suelo y se agradece. Desayuno no muy variado pero todo muy bueno. Lo peor para nosotros fue el colchón, muy blando con lo que no pudimos descansar bien.",3,2018,05,02
103,"Gute Lage, aber ...","Die Lage, ein paar wenige Fussminuten vom Bahnhof Paddington entfernt, ist für die Tube optimal gelegen. Und auch von Heathrow kommend perfekt. Wir haben 2 Deluxe-Zimmer gebucht und uns gefragt, wieso diese so heissen. Sehr kleine Zimmer (okay, London, haben wir befürchtet), sehr kleines Bad und noch kleinere Betten. Wir mussten leider realisieren, dass auch 1,2 m - vielleicht waren es auch 1,4 m - als Doppelbetten durch gehen. Wir buchten dann auf ein andere Kategorie um. Ein paar m2 grösser, dasselbe Bad zwar, aber dafür ein herrlich grosses Bett. Der Frühstücksraum war im Untergeschoss, sehr eng bestuhlt, sehr laut und eine übersichtliche Speiseauswahl. Das Personal war freundlich und hilfsbereit und  bemüht.  ",3,2018,05,01
103,Super Preis-Leistung,"Hotel ist Zentral nahe Paddington Station gelegen. 5 min zum Hyde Park (zum joggen super), mit der u-bahn oder bussen in 10min in Westminster!

103,Mai mai mai più in questo albergo,"Abbiamo soggiornato in questa struttura da merc a dom. Tutto nella norma, salvo quando ci hanno derubato di soldi,documenti e carte di credito l'albergo ha aperto le braccia e ci ha lasciato alla porta.con soli3£ in tasca.Abbiamo chiesto se potevamo fare un bonifico in cambio di contanti e ci è stato detto di no,non si sono neanche proposti di offrirci i pasti fino alla nostra partenza,il giorno dopo.accoglienza nulla,buon senso neppure.mai più.",1,2018,04,16
103,Un buen hotel,"Hicimos una escapada de 5 días a Londres en abril. Nos alojamos 4 en dos habitaciones. El hotel está en una zona tranquila, segura y bonita. Cerca de Metro y estación tren Paddington (5minutos). En general los hoteles de Londres son pequeños, antiguos, etc. Este hotel es un edificio de casas antiguas restauradas. Tiene servicio de recepción de 24H, guarda maletas, pequeña cafetería, ascensor. Las habitaciones son muy pequeñas, con acceso tarjeta y dispone de aire acondicionado, calefacción, tv plana con mando (en inglés todos los canales), wifi, teléfono normal y también un teléfono móvil (llamar gratis y navegar), enchufes compatibles con Europa (España), inglés, americano y hub USB. Luces regulables en luminosidad, luz indirecta, luz lectura y luces cabecero. Aire acondicionado, calefacción, panel interior y exterior con indicador de no molesten, hagan habitación y llamada servicio de habitaciones. Armario con perchas, secador de pelo, caja fuerte gratuita, nevera, (si tienes suerte microondas) calienta agua, tazas, café, leche, azúcar, galletas y agua de bienvenida. Ventana de madera, cortinas, suelo de madera enmoquetado. Cama muy cómoda y dos almohadones por persona. Escritorio con silla libreta y lápiz. El baño es muy pequeño, lavabo, ducha, inodoro, toallas, jabón de manos, gorro plástico, gel y champú. (el secador en el armario por seguridad con el agua solo se puede usar en el espejo de la habitación).El servicio de limpieza está bien.  Es un buen hotel, aunque también tienes habitaciones que no son muy cómodas ya que disponen de camas de 1,20 pegadas a la pared, a nosotros nos tocó una y la cambiamos por otra. También debe haber habitaciones en planta cero y sótano. Para mí fue buena la experiencia. aunque es un poco lotería. Yo lo recomiendo, pero si puedes elige la habitación más grande. Se me olvidaba el desayuno es tipo inglés con zumo, leche, café, pan en tostadora, yogur...",4,2018,04,12
103,"Volveré, volveré, volveré","Sin ninguna duda, este se va a convertir en mi hotel de referencia en Londres. Tienes 2 entradas de metro muy cerca: Lancaster Gate (Central line) y Paddington (Bakerloo line). Desde la estación de Victoria (viajamos desde el aeropuerto de Gatwick con el Gatwick Express) nos costó 15 libras. Su situación es inmejorable, muy cerca de Hyde Park, y es una zona tranquila y segura.
La habitación limpia y cómoda, con frigorífico, cafetera y microondas. El baño bastante grande y, sobre todo, siempre todo MUY limpio.
El personal, por lo general muy joven, siempre con una sonrisa. Me gustaría agradecer especialmente a Monika su amabilidad (tuvimos un problema con la reserva original y nos lo solucionó impecablemente, incluso nos llamó más tarde para asegurarse de que todo estaba bien). Gracias, Monika. 
El desayuno realmente vale la pena. El servicio en el restaurante amable y eficiente. Desayuno variado y de calidad.  
La última noche cenamos en el hotel y es una muy buena opción cuando estás ya un poco cansado. El precio no es más caro de lo que puedes encontrar en la ciudad y el KEBAB, por ejemplo, estaba espectacular.
Solo tenemos buenas palabras para este hotel. Desde luego, volveremos y lo estamos recomendado ya a nuestros amigos.",5,2018,04,08
103,Primer dia mal despues bien,"El primer dia me asignaron una habitación en el sótano extremadamente pequeña con una cama de 1,35 m. Yo peso 125 kg e iba con mi mujer. Probablemente era lo q había reservado pero no me pareció por internet q fuera tan pequeño todo. Previamente había escrito al hotel pidiendo cama grande. No me contestaron. 
Al dia siguiente subí a Recepción y una chica rubia muy muy amable, aunq no hablaba nada de Español, ni ella ni ningún empleado del hotel, a pesar de ese handicap la recepcionista me ofreció enseñarme otra habitación con la cama King Size, la vimos mi mujer y yo y nos pareció bien y nos cambiamos previo pago de 20 libras mas por noche, pero a partir de ahí todo bien. Desayuné el último día y merece las 15 libras q vale porq desayunar en la calle no es mucho mas barato.
En definitiva lo recomendaría, sabiendo de antemano los inconvenientes",4,2018,04,07
103,Pasqua a Londra ,"Siamo 2 coppie ed abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel per 3 notti.

Consigliatissimo!!",5,2018,03,01
103,Kleines aber feines Hotel in London ,"Direkt in der Nähe zum Hyde Park. U Bahnen Paddington und Lancaster Gate in laufnähe. 
Ich empfehle mindestens ein Deluxe Zimmer zu buchen. Diese sind frisch renoviert und befinden sich über die Straße direkt gegenüber der Rezeption. 
Die Zimmer sind typisch für London sehr klein geschnitten. Leider hat der Architekt so Kleinigkeiten wie eine Steckdose für einen Föhn im Bad vergessen. Oder einen Abroller für das Toilettenpapier. Ablageflächen im Bad gibt es leider nicht. Das Frühstück ist im stickigen Untergeschoss, hektisch und voll. Preislich aber gut. ",4,2018,02,22
103,"Buen lugar, cercano al metro","Instalaciones impecables. Cafetera, frigobar y microondas en la habitación. Buena temperatura de la habitación, buena ducha. Habitación cómoda para una persona con poco equipaje.

103,Excelente atención!!,"La habitación tenía todo lo necesario y estaba muy bien mantenida. El servicio de recepción excelente.

103,Muy bueno,"La habitación era bastante pequeña, pero para dos o tres noches no está mal. Todo estaba muy limpio.

103,posizione strategica,"L'hotel si trova in una posizione strategica: a pochi minuti a piedi dalla stazione metro e ferroviaria di Paddington, vicinissimo sia ad Hyde Park che a Little Venice. La zona è ben fornita da negozi, non solo di souvenir ma anche di alimentari, farmacie e ristoranti.

Personale cordialissimo e professionale, la camera era ben fornita (adattatori per prese europee, prese usb vicine ai comodini, phon, asse da stiro, forno a microonde e l'immancabile bollitore con l'occorrente per thé e/o caffé solubile, cellulare per chiamate gratis in Europa).

Camera abbastanza pulita, un po' piccola e - purtroppo- rumorosa in quanto vicina ai motori dei condizionatori. 

A parte questo piccolo inconveniente, ci siamo trovati molto bene e lo consigliamo senz'altro.",4,2018,01,20
103,Gute Lage,"Das Hotel liegt günstig im Stadtteil Paddington, fussläufig vom Bahnhof aus zu erreichen. Das Personal ist freundlich, die Zimmer sauber und ohne Macken.

103,Elegante e confortevole hotel,"L'hotel sembra recentemente ristrutturato e offre ambienti moderni, funzionali e accoglienti. La struttura interna è un pò ""contorta"": tante scale e corridoi su piani diversi. Attenzione alle camere doppie che potrebbero risultare un po' piccole.
Posizionato comodamente tra due linee di metropolitana e a due passi dalle fermate degli autobus. Vicinissimo ad Hyde park.",4,2017,11,28
103,Gute Lage,"Für eine eintägige Geschäftsreise habe ich dieses Hotel aufgrund der guten Lage ausgesucht und des Preises. 

Ich wurde im Nebenhaus untergebracht, in sog. Suiten, was man als Upgrade verkaufte. Im Prinzip in Ordnung, nur wirklich extrem klein. Nescafé gabs zumindest und das Wasser in der Mini Dusche war heiss. Belüftung, Klimaanlage und Heizung etwas undurchschaubar.

Es war einen Versuch wert. Aber vielleicht gibt es für 50 Euro mehr dann dich noch etwas mehr Komfort.",3,2017,11,10
103,Ottimo albergo,"Sono stato in questo albergo per un viaggio di famiglia. La zona è molto bella, residenziale e molto vicina sia alla circle line che alla central line. Victoria si raggiunge in 15 min ed in generale comodissimo al centro città.

L’albergo mi ha fatto subito un’ottima impressione, partendo dal personale molto accogliente e gentile. Avevo prenotato una camera tripla con colazione tramite il loro sito. La stanza era della tipologia club: perfetta per soggiornare in tre. Soprattutto pulita, con ottime finiture dei bagni e un letto e cuscini fra i più comodi che abbia mai trovato in una struttura alberghiera (punto da non sottovalutare dopo una giornata intera a camminare).

Colazione in perfetto stile inglese ma comunque abbondante, bacon and eggs ma anche frutta, pane, brioche e cereali con latte.",5,2017,11,07
103,Excelente atención Zdravko,"Estuve con mi familia hospedados y desde que llegamos la atención fue excelente, muy atentos mostrando las habitaciones para escoger la que mejor se acoplara ya que iba mi bebé, debo decir que fue una habitación muy cómoda por el espacio y amenidades. La ubicación es maravillosa ya que pudimos disfrutar sin tanta complicación del tránsito habitual, sin duda alguna regresaríamos y por supuesto que lo recomiendo altamente. ",5,2017,11,06
103,Excelente y cálida atención,"Es la tercera vez que me hospedo en el hotel. Está muy bien ubicado. Siempre nos vamos caminando desde la estación de Paddington (donde te deja el Heathrow Express desde el aeropuerto) hasta el hotel. El barrio es muy agradable, lleno de tienditas en las q se puede comprar cosas para comer y otras de souvenirs. Además de convenientes casas de cambio. A pocas cuadras de Hyde Park. Y con bicicletas (pagadas) en la puerta del hotel.
Siempre he tenido una excelente experiencia. La gente del front desk y de concierge siempre dispuestos a ayudar y solucionar temas. Este último viaje dejé olvidada mi argolla de matrimonio en el baño del lobby, y me di cuenta al día siguiente. Avisé y la encontraron, y tuvieron el detalle de dejarla en mi habitación con una cajita de chocolates. 
Las habitaciones son pequeñitas, pero todo nuevo e impecable.
Super recomendable.",5,2017,10,28
103,Sehr zu empfehlen !,"Wir haben 2 Deluxe Zweibettzimmer gebucht und waren rundum zufrieden. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer sind klein aber wo bekommt man in London schon Salons die man sich leisten kann. Sie sind aber sehr gut ausgestattet und sehr sauber. Es gibt einen Wasserkocher, Kaffee und Tee, welcher stets wieder aufgefüllt wird und eine Mikrowelle. Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhigen Lage und zu den U-Bahn Stationen ist es nicht weit. Der Hyde Park ist direkt um die Ecke und die Oxford Street schnell zu erreichen. Das zur Verfügung gestellte Handy ist eine super Sache. Unseres war zwar leider defekt aber wenn wir es hätten umtauschen wollen wäre es sicher kein Problem gewesen. Das Frühstück war in Ordnung. Dieses Hotel kann man nur empfehlen !!!!!!

La habitación pequeña pero bien distribuida, con microondas. Todos los días teníamos té en la habitación. 
Volveríamos. ",5,2017,10,18
103,Fin de semana en Londres,"La habitación es un poco pequeña para ser una ""Club Room"" pero por lo demás estaba bastante bien y tanto la zona como la atención recibida fueron muy buenas. El aparcar el coche por un par de días es un lio y yo acabé pagando cerca de 50 libras por aparcarlo en la estación de paddington.",4,2017,10,08
103,La più piccola camera singola della mia vita. Camera 404!,"Ho prenotato una camera doppia (compact), ho immaginato fosse una piccola stanza, del resto viaggiavo da solo, ma pensando di avere a disposizione un letto doppio. In realtà mi sono trovato di fronte ad uno stanzino forse 2,50m X 1,80m le stesse dimensioni del locale dove a casa teniamo detersivi e scope. La più piccola camera singola (con letto singolo) che io abbia visto nella mia vita! Conosco bene gli hotel londinesi ma mai mi era successa una cosa del genere. Imbarazzante anche in relazione al costo di ben 353,40 sterline per due notti senza prima colazione. Tra l’altro accanto all’ascensore tanto che sembrava di dormire nel corridoio. Una truffa! Chiederò il rimborso totale alla struttura.",1,2017,10,03
103,Fast perfekt ,Die Zimmer sind ein bisschen klein aber sehe sauber! Leider nur englisches Fernsehen! Viele Restaurants in der Nähe! Die Metro ist nicht weit entfernt! Sehr schöner Stadtteil! Der Park ist auch gleich um die Ecke!                                 ,4,2017,09,02
103,Molto deludente,"Abbiamo trascorso una notte in questo hotel e non ne siamo rimasti soddisfatti. Al check-in abbiamo dovuto attendere a lungo per essere registrati e la chiave elettronica della camera non era disponibile per un ""problema al sistema"". La camera era un vero e proprio loculo: in due era impossibile muoversi e il letto era più piccolo di un queen size! Assolutamente sconsigliato.",1,2017,08,09
103,Non attendete la camera prenotata,"Prenotazione di 3 stanze con largo anticipo, non erano disponibili quando siamo arrivati e ci hanno mandato in un altro albergo. Hanno incluso la colazione, ma ci hanno assegnato stanze piccole quando avevamo prenotato  e poi pagato junior suite",1,2017,07,21
103,Deludente,"Hanno preteso pagassi il conto in anticipo al momento del check-in, se avessi prima visto la stanza me ne sarei andato altrove. La camera non era piccola, bensí minuscola: non avevamo posto nemmeno per disfare i bagagli (quelli di 3 giorni !), letto da una piazza e 1/2 attaccato alla parete, comodino con spigolo in vetro all'altezza della tempia ! Davvero al di sotto della cubatura minima per poter essere chiamata stanza ! In bagno non ci sarebbe entrata più di una persona per volta. La TV da 32"" era quasi da considerarsi una presa in giro ! 
Ho chiesto immediatamente se si poteva cambiare stanza e se erano tutte cosí.. la risposta è stata negativa ! 
Per trovare la stanza un vero e proprio labirinto di corridoi, scalini, e cartelli indicanti i numeri di stanza con una logica davvero assurda !
La mediocre pulizia si abbinava al contesto.
Davvero un esperienza da non ripetere. Hotel troppo lontano da ció che descrivono sul loro sito !!
Ritengo che per alloggiare a Londra ci sia sicuramente di meglio a quel prezzo !!!",2,2017,07,16
103,Muy bien ubicado,"Excelente ubicación, cerca de la estación Paddington, también estación de colectivo Lancaster Gate y el parque kensington gardens. Muy buena atención, limpieza excelente, lo único que al menos en mi caso jugó en contra fue que la habitación es demasiado chica, pero de todas formas disfrute la estadía.",4,2017,07,11
103,Excelente ubicación pero habitaciones muy chicas para lo que cobran,"El hotel se encuentra a 5 minutos de la estación paddington por lo que es muy cómodo para conectar con heathrow. Las habitaciones son demasiado chicas y las fotos son engañosas, no se justifica el precio que cobran la noche con el tamaño. El personal es muy servicial y amable aunque hay algunos empleados que no tienen conocimiento de la zona, posiblemente sean nuevos o en entrenamiento.",3,2017,07,11
103,my first time in London,"Ottimo hotel, situato a circa 300 metri dalla stazione dei treni di Paddington, dalla metro ""Circle"" e ""Bakerloo"" e dal bus linea 23 comodo per Piccadilly e Trafalgar. Zona tranquilla e silenziosa nonostante numerosi negozi e ristoranti italiani nelle vicinanze. Accoglienza con personale anche italiano che consente maggior dialogo per chi non fosse a proprio agio con la lingua inglese. Camere (club) spaziose e pulite anche se con pavimento di moquette, personale molto cortese ed efficente. Cambio biancheria giornaliero.",5,2017,06,27
103,pensión a precio de 4 estrellas,"Cuando uno paga 200 euros por noche para dormir espera poder dormir. Pero en este hotel no nos ha sido posible: los colchones eran blandos, de muelles y viejos. Uno pasa una noche de cualquier manera, pero no cinco. La habitacion era muy pequeña. Estoy de acuerdo en que no son necesarios 50 m2 para dormir y ducharse, pero uno espera poder llegar del baño a la cama sin tener que saltar por encima de sus maletas. Respecto al servicio, una sonrisa es un buen comienzo, pero debe estar acompañada de una serie de habilidades como la capacidad de gestionar determinadas situaciones y la que creemos era la responsable de recepción (Sara) no supo/pudo solucionar el hecho de que no había quien durmiese en aquellas camas. Se limitó a ordenar que ""diesen la vuelta al colchón"". El resultado es que a las 23h del segundo dia tuvimos que cambiar de hotel a otro de la misma cadena (que resultó aun peor que este en cuanto a instalaciones y a servicio). La ubicación era correcta: en la reserva ponen que las estaciones más proximas son paddington y lancaster gate, pero no te notifican que lancaster gate (que es la que realmente esta cerca) esta cerrada hasta julio. El desayuno es bueno y la zona tranquila, pero desde luego esas dos variables no justifican el precio.",1,2017,06,06
103,Si può rifare. Siamo stati bene,"Abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti in questo hotel e sinceramente ci siamo trovati bene. La camera era una spaziosa junior suite posizionata di fronte all'albergo. Pulita, silenziosa e anche se non abbiamo prenotato la colazione, a pochi metri ci sono locali dove con pochi spicci si fanno buone colazioni. Stazione metro a 5 minuti a piedi. Molto molto gentile Alice, che era continuamente premurosa sul nostro soggiorno. Lo consiglierei ai miei amici",4,2017,05,19
103,Anna e francy,"Siamo contente della nostra scelta, l'hotel si presenta veramente bene ed è posizionato in un'ottima zona vicino ai bus ed alla metro, a due passi da Hyde park. Il personale è cordiale e gentile, in camera ci coccolavamo col kit X il te' e biscottini gentilmente offerto dalla struttura, la camera compatta ma elegante, pulitissima e con tutti i comfort  di un 4 stelle, mia figlia 10 anni è stata benissimo ed io ci ritornerò volentieri grazie in particolare ad Emilia che parla molto bene l'italiano ",4,2017,05,15
103,Week end lungo a Londra,"Il mio fidanzato ed io abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel a maggio. 
L'hotel è in una posizione discreta e tranquilla a circa 5 minuti a piedi dalla metro che consente di raggiungere in maniera comoda e facile i vari punti della città.
Secondo la nostra opinione, un punto negativo di questa struttura è che arrivati al momento del check in, la ragazza della reception ci ha riferito che non potevano accettare la carta con la quale abbiamo prenotato on line, quindi abbiamo dovuto per forza prelevare dei contanti fuori dall'hotel in una delle banche limitrofe. Inoltre il secondo giorno per evitare che la signora delle pulizie entrasse in camera mentre noi facevamo colazione, abbiamo dovuto inserire all'esterno della porta l'indicazione ""stiamo dormendo"" (sono presenti 3 lucette: dormire - pulizie - servizio). La pulizia non è ottima, possono fare di meglio in quanto nella stanza risultava della polvere. La nostra camera era di 13 m2 ma luminosa con un'unica grande finestra. Il bagno molto piccolo. La colazione ha diversa scelta di cibo ma non si presenta abbondante (yogurt,pane,brioches,fagioli,salsicce,latte,verdure,frutta,cereali,succo d'arancia e sidro,) ed è a buffet. L'hotel da disponibilità di tenere al sicuro i bagagli nel caso al momento del check out si desidera uscire per fare un giro in città e poi tornare indietro per prendere le valige e partire. Nel complesso è una struttura discreta adatta a soggiorni di breve durata.",3,2017,05,11
103,Caro para las prestaciones que da,"Habitaciones demasiado pequeñas , las fotos de ellas son engañosas , además la nuestra daba a un patio interior muy sucio
La única recepcionista española no nos resolvía las dudas , sabia poco del hotel , no se si llevaba pocos días o eso daba la impresión",3,2017,04,28
103,"Nonostante tutto, Bello","Sono stato in questo hotel nel periodo di Pasqua con la mia ragazza, abbiamo prenotato tramite Booking.com una camera matrimoniale Deluxe. 
Dopo aver aspettato l'ora esatta per il Check-in, ci hanno fatto uscire dalla struttura, attraversare e ci hanno portato in una camera, praticamente in Taverna, nonostante ci sia la finestra posso assicurare che dava un senso di Soffocamento; dato che questa sensazione prevaleva, ho richiesto il cambio di camera e ci hanno assegnato una camera nella struttura principale, un po' più grande, ma con il problema che era sopra la reception ed il Bar, quindi non era molto insonorizzata ma al contrario si sentiva benissimo quando accendevano la radio e quando qualcuno usciva ed entrava. Le finestre non sono molto recenti, oltre a far passare gli spifferi d'aria si sente tutto fuori; d'altro canto non mi posso lamentare della gentilezza e disponibilità di Alissa che grazie a lei siamo riusciti a farci intendere.
È un Hotel molto comodo per raggiungere tutto ciò che si desidera visitare, ci vuole solo un po' più di chiarezza per spiegare cosa è compreso (cellulare per chiamate e navigazione internet) e cosa no (acqua).
Se dovessi ritornare a Londra ci tornerei volentieri.",4,2017,04,19
103,weekend a Londra,"L'hotel è bello, decisamente buono il rapporto qualità-prezzo. La pulizia molto buona così come la posizione, in pochi minuti sei in centro grazie alla vicinissima metro. Hyde park è proprio lì vicino, ci si può andare a piedi. inoltre proprio di fronte l'hotel c'è la postazione del noleggio bici della città, che poi puoi lasciare in qualsiasi altra postazione (noi in questo modo siamo arrivati a Portobello in meno di 10 minuti).
Le stanze sono piccolissime, ma proprio mini mini, non c'è neanche lo spazio per 2 trolley ma personalmente preferisco sacrificare lo spazio alla pulizia quindi bene così!
il bagno molto pulito e moderno con i pavimenti a terra riscaldati (piacevolissima sensazione quando esci a piedi nudi dalla doccia - molto grande e comoda). 
personale gentile ma senza dare molta confidenza agli ospiti, c'era una ragazza che parlava italiano. 
ci hanno tenuto la valigia fino al pomeriggio del giorno in cui siamo ripartiti.
a meno di 200 m si prende l'autobus per l'aeroporto di Stansted quindi ok. 
eccellente lo smartphone (handy!) che pui portare con te quando vai in giro con le mappe, internet e chiamate per l'italia tutto gratuito. solo per questo merita voto 10 e lode.",4,2017,04,19
103,Eccellente!,"Soggiorno perfetto per una famiglia con figlio di 11 anni: camera confortevole, pulitissima, silenziosa. Bagno spazioso! Apprezzatissimo lo smartphone messo a disposizione dalla struttura con internet (Google maps)  e chiamate gratuite: un vero valore aggiunto!!!!
Personale estremamente cordiale e disponibile, colazione tipica inglese abbondante.
A 5 minuti dai Kensington Gardens (Lancaster Gate) e dalla fermata metro di Paddington. Zona tranquillissima e ricca di ristoranti e minimarket nei dintorni. CONSIGLIATISSIMO!!
",5,2017,04,17
103,Week-end a Londra,"Mi sono recato a Londra lo scorso fine settimana per il compleanno della mia ragazza e abbiamo alloggiato presso il Park Gran Paddington Court.
Diciamo che, a parte la scoperta della cancellazione della nostra prenotazione al momento dell'arrivo (avevano provato a bloccare una cauzione per la camera ma la mia carta di credito non funzionava), il soggiorno è stato molto bello e rilassante nonostante la finestra affacciasse sulla strada. Camera pulita e moderna, servizio di wi-fi gratuito, cambio degli asciugamani ogni giorno, e soprattutto ci hanno messo a disposizione un cellulare da utilizzare come mappa o per chiamate internazionali (tutto incluso nel prezzo). Personale gentile e professionale. Posizione abbastanza comoda per la metro di Paddington. Ci ritornerò!",4,2017,04,10
103,Schönes Hotel!,"Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut. Vom Bahnhof Paddington läuft man nur in paar Minuten und in unmittelbarer Nähe kleine Supermärkte, Restaurant und ein Pub. Der Hyde Park ist nur 5 min entfernt. 
Auch wenn das Zimmer eher klein war, haben wir uns sehr wohlgefühlt. Es war sauber und hübsch eingerichtet. Wir hatten extra ein Zimmer mit 2 Einzelbetten gebucht und diese dann zusammengeschoben, da wir das Risiko eines zu kleinen Doppelbettes vermeiden wollten. Da wir den ganzen Tag unterwegs waren, hat uns die Zimmergröße nicht gestört. Angenhem fanden wir den Wasserkocher und die kleine Auswahl von Tee/Kaffee im Zimmer und den Kühlschrank. Was uns allerding fehlte, waren ein paar Haken um zB eine Jacke aufzuhängen. Die Betten waren sehr bequem; wir haben wunderbar geschlafen. Das Bad war auch eher klein, aber völlig ausreichend und sehr sauber. 
Das Frühstücksbuffet war auch in Ordnung und sehr lecker. 
Das Personal war wirklich sehr nett und zuvorkommend und auch der Zimmerservice war einandfrei. Super fanden wir das hoteleigene Handy, welches man mit in die Stadt nehmen konnte, um dort zB Maps zu nutzen.",4,2017,04,06
103,Perfetto,"Hotel molto accogliente, personale cordiale e stanza molto confortevole. La metro a 10 min di camminata, fattibile. Nonostante le piccole dimensioni della stanzs c'era tutto l' occorrente. Prezzo ragionevole. Consigliato",4,2017,04,03
103,Pretencioso para el precio que cobran,"Era la segunda vez que iba a este hotel. Fui porque encontré  una oferta en internet y también incluía el desayuno que en Londres es un lujo.

El desayuno en este hotel para mí es lo único bueno que tiene, tienes caliente estilo inglés y frío con fiambres, frutas, yogures, etc.

Me dieron una habitacion individual que apenas cabía yo y la maleta. La más pequeña de las vistas  en Londres. Para llegar a la habitación tenía que subir y bajar escaleras que me recordó la biblioteca de Harry Potter, un lío para encontrar la habitación, y por lo tanto nada accesible para personas con movilidad reducida.

El punto más fuerte fue el último día que tenía el check out hasta las 12, y eran las 8,15 de la mañana y tenia que trabajar un rato y me puse el NO MOLESTEN. 
Sin hacer caso de nada, la señora de la limpieza entró sin llamar preguntando si no me iba???? muy poco profesional y mal servicio para un hotel de 4 estrellas.

No volveré.",3,2017,03,29
103,Hotel pulito ed accogliente,"Scelgo questo hotel  con una posizione ottimale vicino alla stazione di Paddington per visitare Londra per la prima volta insieme alla mia ragazza, al nostro arrivo ci accoglie la gentilissima receptionist italiana Alice la quale ci inizializza a tutti i servizi dell'hotel, ci da consigli su cosa visitare e ci fornisce inoltre una mappa della città molto dettagliata ed utile per il viaggio. Eravamo in anticipo per il check in ma ci é stata assegnata una camera ugualmente (disponibile deposito bagagli gratuito), camera non grande ma  per chi non ha particolari esigenze comoda per due persone e sopratutto davvero molto pulita, le foto sul sito sono veritiere (Camera Matrimoniale Deluxe). Idea geniale da parte dell'hotel é inoltre quella di fornire ad ogni stanza uno smartphone (loro lo chiamano Handy) il quale lo si può portare anche fuori ed ha connessione dati e chiamate gratuite verso l'Italia ed altri paesi esteri, comodissimo!
Una sera al nostro ritorno in stanza abbiamo trovato asciugamani a forma di cigno, un biglietto di benvenuto ed una buonissima fetta di torta, siamo stati insomma coccolati per tutta la nostra permanenza. 
Gentilezza di tutto il personale, molta pulizia della stanza, buoni drink nel bar e lo smartphone (handy) mi fanno consigliare ad occhi chiusi a tutti questo hotel, l'unica cosa è che chi ha bisogno di molto spazio dovrà ovviamente prendere la versione della camera più grande. 
Per un futuro viaggio a Londra tornerò sicuramente in questo hotel.",5,2017,03,28
103,Consigliato!!,"Ho soggiornato 5 giorni a Londra. Hotel a 5 min dalla fermata della metro ""Paddington"", quartiere molto ricco e tranquillo, sembra di non essere neanche a Londra! Staff gentilissimo, specialmente le due ragazze italiane alla reception!! Ho prenotato una deluxe double per circa 72€ euro a persona a notte. Certo, la camera è piccola, letto ad una piazza e mezza, ma ha tutti i comfort necessari e soprattutto è pulita! Pavimento con moquet e presa italiana per cui non è necessario premunirsi di adattatore! Lo consiglio a chiunque.. ",3,2017,03,28
103,Tutto bene,"Hotel situato in un quartiere molto tranquillo e pulito, al nostro arrivo ci è stato detto che la caldaia non funzionava e non avremmo potuto avere l'acqua calda (probabilmente erano in overbooking), ma nessun problema, ci hanno spostato nella struttura accanto in maniera molto cordiale e gentile, inoltre ci hanno offerto la colazione per l'intero periodo del pernottamento; La camera anche se piccola si è presentata pulita ed in ordine, il wifi purtroppo non sempre funzionante, personale molto gentile ed educato, la colazione abbastanza ricca, ed infine albergo vicino ai principali mezzi di trasporto.
Nel complesso essendo stato più volte a Londra devo dire che l'albergo merita sia per qualità che per prezzo. ",5,2017,03,26
103,Mi casa por 14 días,"Por motivos de estudios en el extranjero me hospede en el hotel por dos semanas entre fines de Enero a principios de Febrero del corriente año. 
Me hospedé en una habitación individual. Las habitaciones son cómodas y tienen todo lo necesario. En general, las habitaciones en todos los hoteles londinenses suelen ser mas pequeñas de lo normal pero mas alla de eso no dejan de ser cómodas y transitables. Incluyen un set de té/café y un Handy que es un celular libre de uso con internet movil para utilizar por la calle. Viene excelente para ubicarte con el Google map mientras andas por Londres. 
La ubicación es estratégica. Si se llega al aeropuerto de Heathrow se esta en menos de media hora en la estación Paddington, el corazón de los trenes a otras ciudades, mediante el Heathrow Express. Esta estación se encuentra a solo 4 cuadras del hotel y posee varias lineas de subte centrales (Bakerloo Line, District and Circle y Hammersmith & city) 
El trato del personal es excelente, muchos de los trabajadores hablan en español. Las muchachas del salón desayunador y de la recepción son un amor de persona y muy atentas. Son casi como una familia y asi me cuidaron. Siempre que hubo algun pequeño incoveniente tenian la solución a mano. 
El desayuno es abundante, compuesto de facturas, panes, cereales, fiambres, pollo, salchichas, huevos revueltos, yogurt, frutas y verduras. El mismo esta incluido solo si se compra la habitación mediante la pagina web oficial del hotel (el cual tiene el precio más barato). 
 La computadora esta disponible para todos y no se cobran gastos de impresión. 
Mis saludos a todos aquellos que hacen Park Grand Paddington Court a diario, desde la recepción, salón desayunador, departamento de electridad, manager, limpieza y puerta de ingreso. ",5,2017,03,22
103,Hermoso,"El hotel está muy bien ubicado y el sector es hermoso, está muy cerca de la estación de metro Paddington y hay muchos lugares para comer y pequeños negocios cerca. El desayuno buffet también es muy bueno, las personas son muy amables y el café es muy rico. Un hotel cómodo y agradable, las habitaciones tienen de todo. Nosotros compramos algunas cosas para comer (jugos, pan, galletas, etc) en un negocio del sector que era bastante barato para ser Londres y en la noche, en lugar de salir a cenar afuera, nos comíamos algo en la habitación (tienen microondas) lo que nos ahorro mucho dinero. ",5,2017,03,22
103,No volveríamos!,"Fuimos una semana i nos decidimos por este hotel, ya que en las fotos se veían habitaciones agradables y limpias, cerca de estaciones de metro i el precio! Cuando llegamos hubo un malentendido con la agencia y tuvimos que esperar tres horas para que se arreglara, se daban la culpa unos a otros! El encargado nos dijo que nos daba una habitación mejor por el malentendido: una habitación en la que no podíamos quitar las gruesas cortinas porque la ventana tenía un agujero desde el que veíamos fuera i por el que entraba todo el frío de finales de Diciembre, cama incomoda, con un edredón muy pesado y caliente. De tal manera que si ponías la calefacción a tope para no tener frío si nos levantábamos, nos asfixiábamos tumbados, y si no, nos helábamos. Luego un laberinto para llegar a ella, en el que había zonas con calefacción y otras que no!",2,2017,03,19
103,Fantastico,"Siamo stati qui per il mio compleanno 4 giorni, e siamo rimasti felicissimi.. staff gentilissimo, dal ricevimento alla sala colazioni, tutti sempre disponibili e sorridenti! Mi hanno fatto arrivare in camera la sera del mio compleanno una tortina e dei cioccolatini, quindi solo per le coccole che ricevi merita! In più posizione fantastica, a 5 minuti dalla stazione di Paddington e a piedi si arriva benissimo a Hyde Park e Buckingham Palace.. abbiamo intenzione di tornare​ a Londra e sicuramente torneremo li! In più per chi ha problemi di intolleranze alimentari tipo celiachia non è un problema visto che fanno la colazione anche senza glutine, e non è poco! ",5,2017,03,12
103,Bueno,"El hotel está muy bien ubicado en una zona residencial cerca de Hyde Park. El edificio y la calle donde se encuentra son muy lindos. Se puede ir caminando a Notting Hill o a Oxford Circus aunque no son distancias muy cortas. 
El hotel es muy lindo, nuevo y limpio pero la habitación que nos toco (en el edificio de enfrente donde supuestamente eran las suites) era extremadamente chica. ",4,2017,03,10
103,Schöne aber kleine Zimmer ,"Die Zimmer sind schön ausgestattet, sogar eine kleine Küche. Das Wasser ist schön heiß und mit gutem Druck. Lage ist schön - Hyde Park, Tube, Läden, Restaurants alles da, keine teure Ecke. Frühstück hatte ich keines. Das Hotel besteht aus mehreren kleinen Häusern. Sehr hübsch anzusehen!",4,2017,03,09
103,Ottima posizione ,"Per chi visita Londra per la prima volta è l'alloggio ideale.La sua posizione permette di spostarsi con estrema facilità e a pochissimi minuti dal centro.
Stanza molto pulita e ottimo servizio! Grazie ai consigli  di Alice e alla disponibilità di tutto lo staff",5,2017,03,07
103,Encantador,"Excelente ubicación,a 5 minutos caminando, de la estación Paddington y a otros interesantes lugares. Habitación cómoda y acogedora.Muy buen desayuno, ambiente británico,orden y respeto. Excelente atención en la recepción. ",5,2017,03,07
103,Acogedora habitación con todo lo necesario,"Tras leer las críticas de TA sobre el tamaño de las habitaciones reservamos una club room. El personal nos atendió muy bien y nos acompañaron a nuestra habitación que estaba justo en el edificio de enfrente de la recepción. Todo muy limpio y con una pequeña bienvenida en forma de bombones y bebidas sin alcohol, algo de fruta también. 

Quizá la habitación sea algo pequeña pero tiene de todo lo necesario para pasar unas noches en Londres. La cama cómoda y con dos almohadas. El baño pequeño pero con todo lo necesario y muy limpio. Amenities muy variados con albornoces y zapatillas incluidos. 

En cuanto al desayuno muy bueno. Había un pequeño buffet con English y Contiental breakfast. Nosotros fuimos a las 9:30 y se estaba bien. Había gente pero nada agobiante. Al irnos quizá había algo más de gente pero nada exagerado. 

A destacar la amabilidad del personal y su ubicación. 

Recomendable para una visita a Londres. 
",4,2017,03,05
103,Estancia acogedora,"La atención del personal fue muy correcto y agradable. La habitación quizá algo justita pero muy acogedora. El detalle de los cafés con las galletitas,fue un super detalle...porque apetecía salir con en café en las manos!!!, y lo del mv que podíamos llevarnos para callejear...fue un súper puntazo!!!!Sin duda alguna...el hotel tubo muchos detalles que no imaginé y eso nos hizo estar todavía mas agusto!!!",5,2017,02,26
103,Semplice e pulito,"Bell hotel nel pressi della stazione di paddington (collegata perfettamente col centro), ottimo per pulizia e cortesia del personale in quanto hanno soddisfatto tutte le nostre richieste.
Buona pure la colazione, abbondante sia sul dolce che sul salato. Ci tornerei volentieri ",4,2017,02,17
103,Klein aber fein,Da es mein erster London Besuch war hatte ich diese Feine Hotel ausgesucht. Wenn man nur da schläft und duscht ok. Sonst mega kleines Zimmer kaltes Badezimmer da keine Heizung. Auf dem Buchungsbild war eine Badewanne leider nur Dusche. Aber Preis Leistung war sehr gut. Man bekommt ein Handy dazu Gratis und Wlan kostenlos im Hotel. Bin zufrieden. ,4,2017,02,10
103,Hotel ideale per i turisti italiani,"Londra è una città fantastica,ma per noi italiani la scelta dell'hotel è sempre difficile o si trovano hotel sporchi o i più belli sono costosissimi
Questo hotel è davvero il giusto compromesso.
Hotel in ottima posizione,con i mezzi si possono raggiungere facilmente le migliori mete londinesi.
Hotel curato nei dettagli e soprattutto pulito.
Colazione a buffet abbondante.
Attenzione però perché ci sono due tipi di colazione,quella più similile alla colazione ""italiana"" e quella continentale dove si mangia davvero di tutto,la differenza ovviamente è anche il prezzo.",4,2017,02,01
103,senza ascensore,"Posizione perfetta ma la camera singola è veramente piccolissima, con bagno senza bidet - ovvio - e spazzolone - terribile. Inoltre non ha l'ascensore in una delle due ali dell'hotel. Terzo piano a piedi ogni volta. E non è indicato da nessuna parte",3,2017,01,26
103,im zweiten Anlauf passte es,"Wir hatten ein Städtetour nach London und hatten ein anderes Hotel gebucht. Als Ausgleich hatte man uns dann in dieses Hotel gefahren. Hier war die Enttäuschung nach Bezug des Zimmers sehr groß... Vor dem Fenster, und es war wirklich direkt vor dem Fenster befanden sich 3 Klimageräte. Nach unserem Einspruch bekamen wir recht schnell ein anderes (größeres) Zimmer in einer der oberen Etagen. Dieses Zimmer war dann von Ausstattung, Ruhe und Sauberkeit sehr gut. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hat sich noch mehrfach entschuldigt. Die Lage ist sehr gut um London zu erkunden.",4,2017,01,23
103,Grateful! ,"Lovely stay! Everything was really nice. We booked a delux room and at arrival the hotel staff (everybody very friendly and helpful), gave us an upgrade with king size bed! Free smarphone to get out during the day with international calls, maps and things to do. They solved our telephone problems. Room large. Warm. Bathroom very clean, new and warm floor. Absolutely wish to stay here next time. Thank you everybody from italy.

Gran bel l'hotel. Siamo stati 2 notti a gennaio. La prenotazione era per una deluxe che prevede un letto matrimoniale piccolo e al nostro arrivo ci hanno dato un upgrade con il letto king size. Camera grande, pulitissima, bagno nuovo con pavimento riscaldato. Doccia con piatto centrale alto e fisso e braccio doccia mobile. Personale gentilissimo e prezzo congruo. 234 euro in due per 2 notti. Camera rifatta puntualmente. Molto calda ma regolabile. Smartphone gratuito da portare fuori con chiamate internazionali gratuite e internet. Ci hanno risolto i problemi di chiamate a casa. Rispetto agli standard inglesi davvero un ottimo hotel. Consigliatissimo",5,2017,01,20
103,Comodo e grazioso,"Grazioso e comodo albergo situato a Paddington, nelle vicinanze di Hyde Park, ha la central line vicina. Le stanze sono belle ed i letti confortevoli. All'arrivo, in stanza, vino e frutta ed, ogni mattina, cioccolatini sul letto. Piccoli peccati veniali sono : il bagno, un po' troppo piccolo, ma in palazzi d'epoca può capitare, ed il buffet della colazione non molto ricco ne nei dolci ne nei salati. Nel complesso si sta molto bene ed il personale è molto gentile.",4,2017,01,19
103,Buonissimo rapporto qualità/prezzo,"Hotel vicino a Paddington, quindi comodo per i trasferimenti. Perfettamente pulito, letto confortevole, acqua in camera e bollitore per the e caffè. Colazione continentale e inglese di ottima qualità, personale gentilissimo.
Una nota visti i moltissimi commenti sul tema: sì, le camere compact sono piccole (e così anche il letto), ma trovate scritte con chiarezza le dimensioni sul sito. Per noi erano più che sufficienti, e il costo per notte a gennaio davvero ottimo per Londra.",5,2017,01,18
103,Buena opción para conocer Londres.,"Resulta un hotel que ofrece buena relación costo - beneficio, con precios razonables. Y a pesar de que es pequeño, al igual que sus habitaciones, ofrece las comodidades necesarias. Está súper bien ubicado pues a 3 calles está la estación de Paddington, que te conecta a muchos destinos. El barrio muy agradable y muy cerca de Hyde Park. 

Recomendable!!!",4,2017,01,13
103,Ottimo per londra,"Abbi a mo soggiornato 2 notti in questo hotel e con giudizio assolutamente positivo. Avevamo ordinato una matrimoniale deluxe (direttamente dal sito dell'hotel) e ci hanno accolto dandoci una junior suite allo stesso prezzo. Personale cortese e paziente pronto ad ascoltare ogni esigenza. Stanza molto grande (difficile da trovare in questa città),  ottima pulizia e bagno dotato di ogni accessorio. Sicuramente da ripetere. ",5,2017,01,09
103,Molto buono,"Ho pernottato in questo hotel 3 notti e 4 giorni con il mio ragazzo e devo dire che ci siamo trovati molto bene! Servizio e accoglienza buona, camera con bagno molto spazioso e dotato di tutto (doccia molto grande)... l'unica nota stonata è la dimensione della camera: veramente troppo piccola (se si aprono due valigie non ci si riesce più a muovere!). 
Posizione abbastanza ottimale! 
Qualità prezzo ottima... lo consiglio! ",4,2017,01,07
103,Buen hotel y mejor ubicación,"Estuvimos 4 días en Londres y nos alojamos en el este hotel. La ubicación es inmejorable, al lado de dos paradas de metro y Hyde Park. El hotel muy bien, he leído en los comentarios que las habitaciones eran pequeñas pero en nuestro caso, la habitación era muy espaciosa. Estábamos en el ático y se veían los tejados de Londres. Fuimos en invierno y no hacía nada de frío en el hotel. El baño sí que era pequeño pero no suponía ningún problema. ",4,2017,01,05
103,Hotel carino in ottima posizione,"Ho soggiornato con mia moglie in questo hotel nel mese di dicembre 2016.
La struttura è abbastanza moderna, in zona tranquilla ma nel contempo in una posizione ottima per visitare la città.
Le camere sono pulite e confortevoli, l'unica pecca è che sono veramente piccoline.

103,Vacanza indimenticabile,"Stanza dotata di tutti i comfort anche se un po' piccola. TV lcd grande, spine a muro di ogni tipo. Bagno nuovo con box doccia in cristallo. Viene dato uno smartphone ad uso gratuito con connessione ad internet per tutta la durata del soggiorno!!!",5,2016,12,14
103,Habitaciones pequeñas.,"El hotel es limpio, moderno y el personal, en general amable y atento, el problema surge en las habitaciones. Mi familia y yo nos alojamos 5 noches, en total 8 personas y todos nos quejamos de lo minúsculo de las habitaciones. A mi sobrina les cambiaron de habitación la primera noche, porque era pequeña y la ventana no cerraba bien. mi marido y yo pasamos dos noches en una habitación con una cama estupenda para una persona pero no para dos y con el inconveniente añadido de tener que pasar por encima de mi marido si quería ir al baño por la noche. Nos quejamos y nos cambiaron al cabo de dos días, según ellos por falta de disponibilidad,a otra solo un poco más grande.Por el tipo de habitación resulta muy cara, que repito es solo para una persona, pues pagamos por 5 noches 800 libras más el desayuno, que hay que decir que está muy bien.",3,2016,12,11
103,camera da incubo,albergo 4 stelle e camere de luxe12 metri quadrati con bagno così piccolo che se non si chiudeva la porta non potevo neanche lavarmi le mani. colazione ridicola e alla reception l unica cosa che ti dicono e compri la stanza più grande. ridicoli. non lo consiglio,1,2016,11,30
103,Ottimo hotel,"Hotel accogliente e personale gentile (l'intero staff dal desk alla colazione e il personale addetto alle pulizie). Stanza di buone dimensioni (ottime per il centro di Londra). Unico neo scrivania piccola e sedia/sgabello non troppo comoda per lavorare. L'hotel si trova in zona stazione di Paddington a 10minuti a piedi dalla stazione dei treni e dalle linee della metropolitana Bakerloo, Circle e District (fermate Paddington). La fermata della metro Lancaster Gate (sulla Central line) dista poco più di 5minuti a piedi. L'ingresso al parco Hyde Park (Lancaster Gate) si trova alla medesima distanza della metro. La colazione servita nel basement offre una buona selezione tra dolce e salato. L'hotel ha una piccola palestra dotata di due tapis Roulant e due ulteriori attrezzi cardio. Wifi gratuita, in alcuni momenti della giornata risulta un pò lenta ma nel compresso offre un servizio più che buono (per motivi di lavoro). Letto comodo. Bagno non enorme ma ci si muove abbastanza comodamente. Unico aspetto negativo mancano dei supporti per appoggiare il beauty/accessori. Le stanze sono dotate di bollitore per caffe e the. La presa di corrente posta nei pressi della scrivania supporta anche spine di corrente nel formato Europeo continentale (Italia, Francia)",4,2016,11,03
103,"Accogliente, pulito e zona eccellente. Cellulare GRATIS!","Hotel in zona comodissima per treni e tube, circondato da negozietti e locali dove poter comprare/mangiare quasi di tutto. Molto bello passeggiare per le vie circostanti se vi va di provare la sensazione di vivere in città rimanendo in una zona molto bella. L'hotel ha camere moderne e pulitissime, veramente piccole ma non manca nulla, viene addirittura fornito un cellulare gratis per tutto il soggiorno con chiamate, mappe e news. Colazione a buffet buona, cena idem. Stanza singola superior.",5,2016,11,01
103,No intentes deshacer las maletas,"Hemos estado alojados 4 noches, la primera habitación, era tan justa de medidas que no podías abrir ni las puertas, nos cambiaron a otra mas espaciosa segun ellos, pero aun así para ser un 4 estrellas, el armario con falta de perchas y estantes, y el baño...minusculo, sin espacio para poner el neceser, el secador tenías que ir a buscarlo al armario, ah eso si con microondas en la habitación ¡¡¡¡",3,2016,09,15
103,Viaggio a Londra,"Solito alberghetto minuto!!! Pulizia lascia a desiderare!! Posizione molto centrale... Silenzio assoluto nella struttura ma all'arrivo assomiglia alla stazione CENTRALE!!🙄🙄🙄
Una camera era al 4 piano e un'altra al basement....personale straniero",3,2016,08,28
103,Excelente hotel!,"Hemos pasado unos días en Londres y este hotel ha sido una gran elección!!! Hotel moderno, todo muy limpio y personal muy atento, incluso dos chicas hablan español. El desayuno completo, con dos tipos, ingles y continental. La única diferencia entre los dos es que el inglés tiene platos calientes y el continental no. El inglés vale 15 libras y el continental 6 libras aprox. Las habitaciones muy bien, incluso té facilitan un móvil de préstamo gratuito con acceso ilimitado a internet y llamadas gratuitas a España y otros países!!! Muy buena idea! Las habitaciones de categoría club son amplias y están muy bien, el resto, al menos la mía muy pequeña, pero completa en todo. En general un buen hotel en Londres. Repitiera 100% seguro!",5,2016,08,22
103,Buen hotel pero... ,"Buen hotel, pero las habitaciones más simples son demasiado pequeñas para dos personas. 
Nos cambiaron de habitación después de poner una queja, ya que la cama que teníamos era de 1,35 pegada a la pared y sin posibilidad de separarla por lo pequeño de la habitación. 
Muy limpio. Personal muy agradable. Desayuno no muy variado pero suficiente. 
Curioso sistema gratuito de llamadas e Internet. 
Centrico, cerca de bus y metro. 
Restaurantes en la zona. 
Quitando lo del tamaño de la habitación es como un cuatro estrellas español, que en Londres es decir mucho. 
",4,2016,08,11
103,Ottimo Hotel - molto curato,"La camera pur essendo una club veramente troppo piccola.
Finestra molto vecchia con spifferi da tutti i lati.
Il piano del lavandino del bagno così striminzito da non avere lo spazio per il  beauty case.

Staff gentilissimo e premuroso.
Quartiere tranquillo e pulito
Metropolitana a circa tre blocchi di distanza",4,2016,07,27
103,Muy buen hotel,"Hemos estado durante cinco días alojados en este hotel. Lo único que puedo poner en su contra es el tamaño de las habitaciones y baños, ya que aunque están bien equipadas su tamaño es bastante pequeño. Lo demás ha sido perfecto.
Tiene una situación muy buena ,ya que está a 5 minutos de la estación de Paddington, y su personal es muy correcto y amable ( un recuerdo muy especial para la Srta. Mónica ).
Teniamos incluido el desayuno. Este es de tipo buffet y aunque no es muy variado si que es muy correcto y suficiente.
Desde luego nos llevamos un gran recuerdo de este hotel, de su personal y por supuesto de la ciudad.
Si volvemos a Londres ( lo cual espero que si ) este establecimiento será una de nuestras opciones.",4,2016,07,13
103,Guter Ausgangspunkt für London,"Das Hotel insgesamt ist ganz ok. Das Einchecken war sehr umkoordiniert. Unser Zimmer lag im 1. Untergeschoss und eine inakzeptabel laute Klimaanlage war direkt vor der ""Balkon""tür, die auch bei geschlossenen Fenstern noch zu hören war. Mit einem anderen Zimmer vielleicht ganz ok.",3,2016,07,04
103,El hotel esta muy bien situado,"Las habitaciones son pequeñas pero acogedoras....
La primera que nos dieron muy oscura y con la ventana a un patio muy oscuro,,
nos la cambiaron a otra que estaba mejor pero un poco oscura.
El personal muy amable",3,2016,06,19
103,Limpio y comodo,"Pasamos unos dias de vacaciones en Londres. Elegimos este hotel por sus opiniones. No nos equivocamos. Aunque sus habitaciones son pequeñas y su baño minúsculo, la cama es grande y muy muy cómoda, de las mejores que he probado. En general el personal muy amable, excepto el ultimo dia que nos intentaron cobrar dos desayunos ( 32 euros) que no habíamos ni hecho ni reservado. Comprobar bien las facturas.
Bien situado, al lado de hyde park piedes hacer muchas de las visitas obligadas a pie disfrutando de esta preciosa ciudad.",4,2016,06,18
103,Pulizia ottima personale cordialissimo,Hotel con le due stazioni della metro vicine a 500 m quella di lancaster gate  e paddigton station collegato benissimo personale gentilissimo ci sono anche italiani l unica pecca la stanza minuscola per il resto riprenoterei qui in futuro sono stata veramente bene letto comodo anche se a una piazza e mezza ,4,2016,06,14
103,Ottimo hotel rapporto qualità/prezzo,"Ottimo hotel per il rapporto qualità prezzo, molto comoda la metro' a circa 500 mt troviamo due entrate, quartiere molto tranquillo ma lo stesso pieno di negozietti e ristorantini/pub carini, nel complesso quindi ottima scelta.",4,2016,05,21
103,Un hotel da favola,"Quello che cerchiamo sempre in un albergo è la posizione e la pulizia e sappiamo che quest'ultima è fondamentale a londra, dove è lasciata un po' a desiderare (secondo persone che ci sono state e che ci hanno vissuto). La posizione è ottima, in quanto presenta la possibilità di prendere tre linee metropolitane e sorge in un bellissimo quartiere, silenzioso, romantico e lussuoso. Appena arrivati abbiamo notato subito la bellezza dell'hotel ( 4 stelle che secondo noi potrebbero essere direttamente 5) e la gentilezza del personale, che ha cercato di farci comprendere le cose anche quando non capivamo benissimo l'inglese. Nella struttura è presente anche un ragazzo italiano, andrea, anch'esso gentile e disponibile. Inoltre c'è sempre un usciere alla porta e le valigie ci sono state portate in camera. La stanza da noi presa è stata la delux, le cui foto sul sito sono veritiere. Non eccessivamente grande ma perfetta per due persone, veramente bella, moderna, pulita e dotata di ogni comfort: prese di ogni tipo, aria da poter regolare, tende normali e oscuranti, poggia valigia, scrivania, televisore grande e piatto, letto comodissimo, cassaforte, phon, appendi abiti, bollitore. Il primo giorno ci hanno fornito due bottigliette d'acqua, mentre ogni giorno venivano riforniti caffè, thè, biscotti e zucchero. Nonostante per terra ci fosse la moquette, che noi odiamo, non ci ha infastidito perchè si vedeva che era nuova e pulita (si potevano vedere i segni dell'aspirapolvere). Il bagno super bello e pulito! La doccia aveva sia il flessibile che il getto dall'alto. Ogni giorno sono stati cambiati gli asciugamani e i teli e sono stati rifornite le bottigliette di shampoo, balsamo, cuffietta doccia e bagnoschiuma. Anche il bagno dell'hotel è superpulito. Un altro servizio utilissimo è la custodia delle valigie, di cui abbiamo usufruito sia il primo giorno (essendo arrivati prima dell'ora del check-in), sia l'ultimo giorno. 
Già consigliato a tutti i miei amici, che essendo già stati a londra, dalla descrizione e dalle foto sul sito (veritiere), sono rimasti piacevolmente colpiti, come noi.",5,2016,05,16
103,Nuevo y moderno,"La habitación es justa en espacio. Excelente baño. Cama muy cómoda. Excelente ubicación. Calentador de agua, te y café. Silencioso. El servicio de wifi es perfecto. Varios pubs en la zona. La atención de Roberta en el lobby fue de mucha ayuda.

103,Bilder entsprechen nicht...,"Waren etwas überrascht über unser Zimmer. Statt zwei Betten (Junior Suite) bekamen wir ein Zimmer mit einem schmalen Doppelbett und einem Behelfsbett, ausgeklappt aus dem Ecksessel. Zimmer sehr klein. Unser erstes Zimmer konnten wir nicht annehmen, da man zu dritt schlicht keinen Platz hatte. Dann in ein anderes Zimmer gewechselt. Dort ging es dann einigermassen. Frühstück war klein aber ok.
Die Bilder im Internet entsprachen in keinster Weise den Zimmern die wir gesehen und bewohnt haben.",3,2016,05,05
103,Hotel favoloso!,"L'hotel si trova in quartiere molto elegante di Londra a due passi dalla metro.Siamo stati in questo hotel per una sola notte, l'accoglienza è stata fantastica personale molte gentile e disponibile.

103,Horrible,"Nos saltó la alarma anti-incendios en dos ocasiones, a la 1 de la madrugada y a las 8 de la mañana, con sendos desalojos. A la primera nos dijeron que fue por un tostador, y la segunda por un cigarro
 Mucha casualidad no? No estaria mal regulada. Solo nos pidieron perdon. En fin inaceptable.
Por cierto la cama doble de 1,10. Y todo por 250 pavos noche. Un robo.",1,2016,04,27

103,Bell'Hotel in un ottimo quartiere residenziale,"Per il nostro viaggetto a Londra abbiamo soggiornato 2 notti in questo caratteristico hotel in uno dei quartieri residenziali più carini di Londra. Il senso di pulizia dell'ambiente nel quale l'hotel è immerso già ci prepara all'esperienza molto buona che avremo. Siamo arrivati ben prima che la camera fosse pronta (ne eravamo consapevoli) ed abbiamo effettuato il check-in assistiti benissimo dal personale. Posati i bagagli siamo usciti per fare un primo giro al centro. Ritornati abbiamo potuto prendere chiavi e bagagli ed accomodarci nella stanza prenotata. Abbiamo preso una Matrimoniale Deluxe: molto molto carina, piccola ma accogliente, con una doccia fantastica, un letto molto comodo e l'immancabile moquette. Veramente un'ottima sistemazione, siamo stati trattati benissimo con molta gentilezza dal personale. Il giorno della partenza ci hanno conservato le valigie fino al momento di tornare all'aeroporto. Sicuramente un'ottima scelta.",4,2016,04,18
103,Maravillosa estancia en londres,"Excelente estancia de cinco noches en un hotel estupendo,sobre todo por la amabilidad de todo el personal,en especial agradecimiento a Lizzi, que hizo que el regreso a casa fuese posible tras un descuido por mi parte con la  documentacion de los vuelos, que tras olvidarla en la recepcion al hacer el chek out, nos la envio por un mensajero al momento a la estacion de donde partiamos hacia el aeropuerto y asi llegar a tiempo.
Aunque no fue la eleccion inicial pues fuimos derivados desde el london paddington de la misma cadena por un problema en las instalaciones y por lo cual disfrutamos del desayuno buenisimo por cortesia de la cadena hotelera, destacar la limpieza y el buen gusto en general de todas las instalaciones.La triple magnifica, y la doble aunque un poco mas pequeña, muy bien equipadas y con camas estupendas.
No es necesario adaptadores de red electrica pues disponen de varios tipos de enchufes en la habitacion.
Habitaciones muy tranquilas, en planta 4 y 3.
No duden en alojarse en el, ademas esta muy bien situado.",5,2016,04,12
103,Londres Marzo 2016,"Nos alojamos por 5 noches en este hotel y la estancia fui muy buena. Cama grande, super detallistas, y el hotel está muy cerca de la estacion de paddington y de la parada de bus de lancaster gate. 
Tuvimos un problemilla que nos cobraron 2 veces la habitación por tema de autorización de tarjetas, pero hasta que no se solucionó estuvimos mandándonos mails para intentar solucionarlo. 'No pasan del tema'. Lo solucionamos hablando con el banco.
Por lo demás genial. ",5,2016,04,03
103,Schnuckelig + Top-Lage + nettes personal,"Eigentlich war dieses Hotel gar nicht geplant, aber das von uns gebuchte Hotel (Grand Royal) hat uns kurzerhand rausgeschmissen  - zum Glück!
Das Personal war hier sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend und ich wollte auch in der zweiten Nacht nicht umziehen, was gegangen wäre. Das Hotel liegt direkt am entspannten Hyde-Park, aber auch Metro ist bestens in Kürze zu erreichen.
Ich konnte mir morgens auch Kaffee auf dem Zimmer machen (das ist immer wichtig für mich ;-)) - in Pulverform, aber gut war er.
Der Blick aus dem Zimmer (172) war auch sehr schön.
Das Zimmer selbst war mini - unsere Koffer haben kaum Platz gefunden, aber so mag ich es. Das Doppelbett war dafür sehr großzügig und wir haben traumhaft geschlafen:
Bad auch mini, aber sauber.
Wir kommen sehr sehr gerne wieder.",4,2016,03,29
103,Non ne vale la pena,"L'hotel si trova a pochi passi da Hyde Park ed è ben collegato con la metropolitana ma mi ha abbastanza deluso. La camera, quella superior, è davvero piccola e la moquette la fa sembrare anche abbastanza sporca. 
Allo stesso prezzo si possono trovare sicuramente hotel migliori

103,Habitación pequeña pero buena,"Nos trasladaron de otro hotel a este, al ppio  me ubicaron en una habitación en el primer piso pero había mucho ruido debía calles, pedí cambio y nos dieron la misma pero en el piso 4 y nos fue bien, es bien estrecha pero con detalles buenos. El piso tiene calentador, el secador de pelo le pareció extrañamente bueno a mi esposa que nunca le gustan los secadores de los hoteles. Máximo para dos personas. El aseo es bueno y el servicio tambien. Nos dieron desayuno de cortesía lo cual fue fenomenal. Esta cerca de la estación de tren y de metro. No le doy mas puntos por el tamaño de la habitación.",4,2016,03,14

È in ottima posizione in un quartiere tranquillo, il personale è super gentile e disponibilissimo!!
Colazione abbondantissima,camera ben arredata pulita ed ottimo bagno con box doccia!!!
Unico neo, se vi riserveranno una camera a piano terra di notte sentirete i passi delle persone sul marciapiede....se sono donne col tacco vi sveglierete!!!!!!!!
Stesso discorso se ospiti come voi decidessero di fumarsi l'ultima sigaretta in compagnia prima di salire in stanza...le voci si sentirebbero forte e chiaro!!!
Consiglio di farvi dare una stanza interna o nei piani superiori!",4,2016,03,09

Buena conexión Wi-Fi. Ducha tipo cascada. Cama confortable y grande. Cerca de la estación de Paddington.

Habitación con vistas a un patio minúsculo. Falta de una silla en la mesa, únicamente un taburete. Esperar a que hubiera una habitación libre hasta las 14:00",4,2016,02,23
103,Weekend lungo,"Io e mio marito siamo stati 4 giorni in questo hotel, pulito e comodo essendo vicino alla metro.
L'unica cosa spiacevole è che ci hanno dato una camera molto piccola, anche se avevo pagato per una camera più grande, però fatto presente il problema il giorno dopo ci hanno sistemato in una camera più grande.
A parte questo lo consiglierei per il rapporto qualità prezzo.",4,2016,02,22
103,Tutto perfetto!!!,"Sono stato in questo hotel con la mia fidanzata,ottima organizzazione da parte della struttura,il personale è tutto gentile e disponibile.
Le stanze sono pulite e grandi per essere a Londra,vale in assoluto le 4 stelle,consigliato a tutti!!!",5,2016,02,17
103,Bonito hotel con muchos detalles del personal,"Nos alojamos en este hotel cuando visitamos un fin de semana Londres por el cumpleaños de mi esposa. realicé el comentario al reservar el hotel, y nuestra sorpresa fue grata a la llegada al hotel, que estaba decorada felicitando el cumpleaños y con regalitos de tipo gastronómico como bombones, botellita de vino tinto chileno (bastante rico) y fruta fresca. Nos recibió Diana al hacer el check-in y la felicitó muy amablemente.Estamos muy agradecidos por todos esos detalles que nos hizo la estancia muy especial. El buffet desayuno está bastante bien, y las habitaciones tienen una decoración moderna y elegante con excelente limpieza. La nuestra era doble superior y estaba muy bien de tamaño sin llegar a ser grande, acogedora seria el adjetivo, el baño tiene un sistema que calienta el suelo radiante.",5,2016,02,11
103,Mi aspettavo qualcosa di più,"Dalle varie recensioni lette mi aspettavo qualcosa di più dall'albergo. 

La posizione è molto buona. In 5 min a piedi si raggiunge la stazione di paddington e ai piedi dell'albergo ci sono vari ristoranti e supermercati. 

Avevamo una deluxe room. Le tende erano mezze rotte e la piccola ""cucina"" della stanza non aveva un aspetto estremamente pulito. Per sbaglio ho dimenticato di togliere il cartello ""do not disturb"" una volta uscita dalla stanza. Quando sono tornata ho trovato un foglio sotto la porta che diceva di chiamare la reception per richiedere che qualcuno venisse a rifare la stanza. Ho chiamato e sono uscita, una volta tornata la stanza non era stata rifatta. I colori della stanza sono molto tristi (sul giallino). L'ascensore assomiglia molto agli ascensori di servizio.

Le persone che lavorano alla reception sono gentili e cercano di soddisfare le richieste dei clienti.",3,2016,02,07
103,Wirklich gute Wahl!,"Das Hotel befindet sich in einer super Lage, man kommt von hierher überall schnell hin. Das Personal ist zuvorkommend und die Zimmer sauber. Wir waren im 4. Stock, dort hatte es leider keine Fenster im Zimmer. Die Gänge waren etwas eng im Zimmer. Ansonsten war alles gut!",4,2016,01,31
103,Hotel valido in posizione strategica,L' Hotel si trova in una bellissima zona fuori dal caos e a due passi da tutti i principali servizi. Curato nei minimi particolari. Stanza forse un po' piccola ma con tutti i comfort necessari. Ci hanno colpito l'illuminazione relax mode della doccia e la connessione Wi-Fi gratuita. In generale abbiamo apprezzato la cortesia e la disponibilità del personale. Nella nostra prossima visita a Londra torneremo certamente in questo Hotel scegliendo una stanza più grande.,4,2016,01,29
103,Bella esperienza,Il punto di forza è sicuramente la posizione. L'hotel è in una zona carina dove ci sono molti ristoranti e soprattutto ha le fermate della metro vicine Paddington (Circle e District) e Lancaster gate (Central) che lo rendono davvero comodo per visitare la città. La struttura è carina e moderna. Il personale è molto gentile è alla reception c'era anche una ragazza che parlava in italiano. I sevizi direi che sono in linea con hotel quattro stelle. Le stanze sono moderne e soprattutto molto pulite. In effetti sono molto piccole e se si è in due con due trolley grandi potrebbe non essere facilissimo muoversi dentro la stanza. Noi eravamo in una stanza deluxe in due con una sacca a persona e stavamo in stanza solo per dormire quindi ci siamo trovati molto bene.,4,2016,01,26
103,Muy detallista,"Por el tamaño de las habitaciones se merece menos puntuación. Pero es que son tan detallistas... el baño es enano pero la ducha es bastante grande en comparación,  una orquidia verdadera en la mesilla, albornoz, reponen amenities (los cepillos de dientes), tv gigante,  servicio de limpieza por la noche,  te abren la cama (no sé si la dejaron asi o es q hicieron la cobertura. Si es lo segundo.. genial) pides algo y se desviven... para ser un 4, tiene detalles de 5. Lo unico malo.. el mínimo tamaño de las habitaciones. Por favor no vayais a la mas pequeña porque no cabe ni la maleta.",4,2016,01,25
103,Meraviglioso,"Park Grand é un hotel elegante, siamo stati accolti stupendamente, giá dal primo momento quando due membri del personale sono corsi ad aprirci gli sportelli del taxi! Park Grand é un hotel preparato e soprattutto cordiale e gentile, parlano tutte le lingue (l'italiano benissimo) , non ti fanno preoccupare di niente! La pulizia delle stanze è ottimale e il comfort della stanza é divino! Consiglio assolutamente una vacanza in questo hotel, centralissimo a Londra in una zona davvero bella e vicinissimo alla fermata Lancaster gate! In particolar modo ringraziamo SAKINA è stata gentilissima e bravissima, Park Grand deve essere fiero di avere Sakina tra il suo staff! ",5,2016,01,03
103,"Hotel agradable, aunque con....","Las habitaciones y las instalaciones del hotel están bastante bien, pero cuando fuimos este año, estaban en obras, y la habitación se encontraba dentro de un laberinto de pasillos y escaleras.

103,Nettes Hotel mit gutem Ausgangspunkt,"Waren für einen Kurztrip in London und haben uns für dieses Hotel entschieden. U- Bahn ist gleich ums Eck und es funktionierte alles tadellos. Zimmer sind klein jedoch vollkommen ausreichend,schön und sauber.Frühstück war auch in Ordnung. Service muss wirklich extra erwähnt werden, da das Personal super zuvorkommend,hilfsbereit und auch in Stresssituationen stehts die Ruhe bewahrt hat!!! Praktisch sind auch die Lokale in unmittelbarer Nähe. Spezial das Pub in der Straße, in dem abends ein schöner Tagesausklang möglich ist und der Inder ums Eck!Alles in allem ein angenehmer stressfreier Aufenthalt in einem schönen Hotel.",5,2015,12,15

103,Piccolo ma molto curato,"Decisamente spazi ristretti (come un po' ovunque a Londra) ma davvero molto curato nei dettagli . 
Rapporto qualita' prezzo buono se prenotate dal loro sito www.preminumclubrewards.com e cercate le loro offerte.. Parcheggio delle bici adiacente, ci tornei sicuramente .",4,2015,08,13
103,"Buon hotel, ma...","Ci sono andato diverse volte x lavoro, è un buon hotel, in una zona tranquilla, con 6-7 sterline di taxi sei in piena vita (oxford street).
Bene la pulizia, personale alla reception disponibile. Camere piccolissime! Personalmente Evitare assolutamente le singole, troppo piccole. anche da soli consiglio la matrimoniale. Ingresso principale in devonshire terrace, ma mi è capitato al check in di essere dirottato all ingresso sito in craven hill (100 m di distanza). Sarà un caso, ma le 2 volte che mi hanno registrato in craven hill ho avuto camere più brutte. Al momento della prenotazione assicurarsi che si tratti dell hotel in devonshire terrace, esistono altri shaftesbury, uno anche a 2-3 isolati che considero di categoria molto inferiore. ",3,2015,08,09
103,Molto rilassante ,"Premettendo che sono un amante di tutti i comfort quando si è in vacanza, quindi esigo molto dai locali in cui vado ad alloggiare e questo hotel mi ha soddisfatto sotto vari profili: pulizia stanze, pulizia generale, bellezza stanze, colazione internazionale. Unica pecca le stanze un po' piccole ma a quanto ho capito penso che tutta Londra sia combinata così.
Comunque un bell'hotel nel complesso sicuramente non getterò il biglietto da visita per una futura ed eventuale prenotazione ",4,2015,08,06
